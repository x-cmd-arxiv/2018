$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{T}}_{\lambda}(\mathcal{S}_a, \mathcal{S}_c)$ whose
structural properties can be described. In the case of $k$-quasi-radial
functions $\mathcal{S}_a$ and bounded uniformly continuous or vanishing
oscillation symbols $\mathcal{S}_c$ we describe the structure of elements from
the algebra $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{T}}_{\lambda}(\mathcal{S}_a, \mathcal{S}_c)$,
derive a list of irreducible representations of
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{T}}_{\lambda}(\mathcal{S}_a, \mathcal{S}_c)$, and prove
completeness of this list in some cases. Some of these representations
originate from a `quantization effect', induced by the representation of
$\mathcal{A}_{\lambda}^2(\mathbb{B}^n)$ as the direct sum of Bergman spaces
over a lower dimensional unit ball with growing weight parameter. As an
application we derive the essential spectrum and index formulas for
matrix-valued operators.

well understood, the key question being the role of physical processes such as
thermal absorption in shaping them. In this work we take advantage of the LOFAR
Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) to investigate such spectra for a
large sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. Using the measured 150MHz flux
densities from the LOFAR MSSS survey and literature flux densities at various
frequencies we have obtained integrated radio spectra for 106 galaxies. The
spectra are explained through the use of a three-dimensional model of galaxy
radio emission, and radiation transfer dependent on the galaxy viewing angle
and absorption processes. Spectra of our galaxies are generally flatter at
lower compared to higher frequencies but as there is no tendency for the highly
inclined galaxies to have more flattened low-frequency spectra, we argue that
the observed flattening is not due to thermal absorption, contradicting the
suggestion of Israel & Mahoney (1990). According to our modelled radio maps for
M51-like galaxies, the free-free absorption effects can be seen only below
30MHz and in the global spectra just below 20MHz, while in the spectra of
starburst galaxies, like M82, the flattening due to absorption is instead
visible up to higher frequencies of about 150MHz. Locally, within galactic
disks, the absorption effects are distinctly visible in M51-like galaxies as
spectral flattening around 100-200MHz in the face-on objects, and as turnovers
in the edge-on ones, while in M82-like galaxies there are strong turnovers at
frequencies above 700MHz, regardless of viewing angle. Our modelling suggests
that the weak spectral flattening observed in the nearby galaxies studied here
results principally from synchrotron spectral curvature due to cosmic ray
energy losses and propagation effects.

is generally a computation-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits
the throughput of this method. We report an accelerated version of the

multiple distributed GPUs. This approach leverages available scientific
computing packages in Python, including mpi4py and PyCUDA, with the core
computation functions implemented in CUDA C. We find that interestingly even
with MPI collective communications, the weak scaling in the number of GPU nodes
can still remain nearly constant. Most importantly, for realistic diffraction
measurements, we observe a speedup ranging from a factor of $10$ to $10^3$
depending on the data size, which reduces the reconstruction time remarkably
from hours to typically about 1 minute and is thus critical for real-time data

towards noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The Nyquist-Shannon
sampling theorem, introduced in this context by Macridin, Spentzouris, Amundson
and Harnik building on the work of Somma, provides a guide with which to
evaluate the efficacy of two field-space bases, the eigenstates of the field
operator, as used by Jordan, Lee and Preskill, and eigenstates of a harmonic
oscillator, to describe $0+1$- and $d+1$-dimensional scalar field theory. We
show how techniques associated with improved actions, which are heavily
utilized in Lattice QCD calculations to systematically reduce lattice-spacing
artifacts, can be used to reduce the impact of the field digitization in
$\lambda\phi^4$, but are found to be inferior to a complete
digitization-improvement of the Hamiltonian using a Quantum Fourier Transform.
When the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is satisfied, digitization errors
scale as $|\log|\log |\epsilon_{\rm dig}|||\sim n_Q$ (number of qubits
describing the field at a given spatial site) for the low-lying states, leaving
the familiar power-law lattice-spacing and finite-volume effects that scale as
$|\log |\epsilon_{\rm latt}||\sim N_Q$ (total number of qubits in the
simulation). For localized(delocalized) field-space wavefunctions, it is found
that $n_Q\sim4(7)$ qubits per spatial lattice site are sufficient to reduce
theoretical digitization errors below error contributions associated with
approximation of the time-evolution operator and noisy implementation on
near-term quantum devices.

kinematics respond to the environment. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio our
galaxy clusters are normalised and co-added to a projected cluster radius at
$0.0 - 2.5$ $r_{200}$. We find merging cluster environments possess an
abundance of a kinematically-active (rising VDP) mix of red and blue elliptical
galaxies, which is indicative of infalling substructures responsible for
pre-processing galaxies. Comparatively, in non-merging cluster environments
galaxies generally decline in kinematic activity as a function of increasing
radius, with bluer galaxies possessing the highest velocities, likely as a
result of fast infalling field galaxies. However, the variance in kinematic
activity between blue and red cluster galaxies across merging and non-merging
cluster environments suggests galaxies exhibit differing modes of galaxy
accretion onto a cluster potential as a function of the presence of a core
merger.

connectivity (dFC), consisting of time-varying spatiotemporal dynamics, may

discrete major brain status via spatial clustering, which ignores rich
spatiotemporal dynamics contained in such chronnectome. We propose Deep
Chronnectome Learning for exhaustively mining the comprehensive information,
especially the hidden higher-level features, i.e., the dFC time series that may
add critical diagnostic power for MCI classification. To this end, we devise a
new Fully-connected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Full-BiLSTM)
to effectively learn the periodic brain status changes using both past and
future information for each brief time segment and then fuse them to form the
final output. We have applied our method to a rigorously built large-scale
multi-site database (i.e., with 164 data from NCs and 330 from MCIs, which can
be further augmented by 25 folds). Our method outperforms other
state-of-the-art approaches with an accuracy of 73.6% under solid

The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid Vesta have been studied by
the Dawn space mission. They are the two heaviest bodies of the main asteroid
belt and have different characteristics. Notably, Vesta appears to be dry and
inactive with two large basins at its south pole. Ceres is an ice-rich body
with signs of cryovolcanic activity.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to determine the obliquity variations of Ceres
and Vesta and to study their rotational stability.
  Methods. The orbital and rotational motions have been integrated by
symplectic integration. The rotational stability has been studied by
integrating secular equations and by computing the diffusion of the precession
frequency.
  Results. The obliquity variations of Ceres over $[-20:0]\,\mathrm{Myr}$ are
between $2$ and $20{\deg}$ and the obliquity variations of Vesta are between
$21$ and $45{\deg}$. The two giant impacts suffered by Vesta modified the
precession constant and could have put Vesta closer to the resonance with the
orbital frequency $2s_6-s_V$. Given the uncertainty on the polar moment of
inertia, the present Vesta could be in this resonance where the obliquity
variations can vary between $17$ and $48{\deg}$.
  Conclusions. Although Ceres and Vesta have precession frequencies close to
the secular orbital frequencies of the inner planets, their long-term rotations
are relatively stable. The perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn dominate the
secular orbital dynamics of Ceres and Vesta and the perturbations of the inner
planets are much weaker. The secular resonances with the inner planets also
have smaller widths and do not overlap, contrary to the case of the inner
planets.

confinement where phonon modes take discrete values of energy (in bulk, the
modes are quasi-continuous). One by one excitation of phonon modes modulates
the surface currents on nano-particles that led to a fluctuating magnetization

adapting de Carvalho's analysis of call-by-name via multi types (aka
non-idempotent intersection types). Our type system characterises normalisation

carry quantitative information about the cost of evaluation: their size bounds
the number of evaluation steps and the size of the normal form, and we also

finitely ramified boundary with the structure of a self-similar lattice graph.
We derive the entropy as a function of the decimation factor which determines
the spectral dimension, the latter being generically different from the
topological dimension. For large decimations, the graph becomes increasingly
dense, yielding a gain in the entanglement entropy which, in the asymptotically
smooth limit, approaches a constant value. Conversely, a small decimation
factor decreases the entanglement entropy due to a large number of spectral
gaps which regulate the amount of information crossing the boundary. In line
with earlier studies, we also comment on similarities with certain holographic
formulations. Finally, we calculate the higher order corrections in the
entanglement entropy which possess a log-periodic oscillatory behavior.

two famous variants, i.e., the stochastic heavy-ball (SHB) method and the
stochastic variant of Nesterov's accelerated gradient (SNAG) method. We propose
a framework that unifies the three variants. We then derive the convergence

analyze the generalization performance through the uniform stability approach.
Particularly, the convergence analysis of the training objective exhibits that
SHB and SNAG have no advantage over SG. However, the stability analysis shows
that the momentum term can improve the stability of the learned model and hence
improve the generalization performance. These theoretical insights verify the
common wisdom and are also corroborated by our empirical analysis on deep

different rates of intergranular attack and minor element depletion distances
ahead of the oxidation front for nickel-based binary alloys depending on the
minor element. For example, a significant Cr depletion up to 9 microns ahead of
grain boundary crack tips were documented for Ni-5Cr binary alloy, in contrast
to relatively moderate Al depletion for Ni-5Al (~100s of nm). We present a
mathematical kinetics model that adapts Wagner's model for thick film growth to
intergranular attack of binary alloys. The transport coefficients of elements
O, Ni, Cr, and Al in bulk alloys and along grain boundaries were estimated from
the literature. For planar surface oxidation, a critical concentration of the
minor element can be determined from the model where the oxide of minor element
becomes dominant over the major element. This generic model for simple grain
boundary oxidation can predict oxidation penetration velocities and minor
element depletion distances ahead of the advancing front that are comparable to
experimental data. The significant distance of depletion of Cr in Ni-5Cr in
contrast to the localized Al depletion in Ni-5Al can be explained by the model
due to the combination of the relatively faster diffusion of Cr along the grain
boundary and slower diffusion in bulk grains, relative to Al.

is a fundamental process affecting a variety of applications based on
semiconductor nanostructures. From a theoretical perspective, the description
of Auger recombination in confined semiconductor nanostructures is a
challenging task due to the large number of valance electrons and exponentially
growing number of excited excitonic and biexcitonic states that are coupled by
the Coulomb interaction. These challenges have restricted the treatment of
Auger recombination to simple, noninteracting electron-hole models. Herein we
present a novel approach for calculating Auger recombination lifetimes in
confined nanostructures having thousands to tens of thousands of electrons,
explicitly including electron-hole interactions. We demonstrate that the
inclusion of electron-hole correlations are imperative to capture the correct
scaling of the Auger recombination lifetime with the size and shape of the
nanostructure. In addition, correlation effects are required to obtain
quantitatively accurate lifetimes even for systems smaller than the exciton
Bohr radius. Neglecting such correlations can result in lifetimes that are 2
orders of magnitude too long. We establish the utility of the new approach for
CdSe quantum dots of varying sizes and for CdSe nanorods of varying diameters
and lengths. Our new approach is the first theoretical method to postdict the
experimentally known universal volume scaling law for quantum dots and makes
novel predictions for the scaling of the Auger recombination lifetimes in

galaxies contain hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) which emit ionizing
photons. The difference must thus lie in the presence or absence of a reservoir
of ionizable gas. From a volume-limited sample of 38\,038 elliptical galaxies,
we explore differences in physical properties between liny and lineless using
data from the SDSS, WISE and GALEX catalogues. To avoid biases in the
comparison, we pair-match liny and lineless in stellar-mass, redshift and
half-light Petrosian radius. We detect marginal differences in their optical
stellar ages and NUV luminosities, indicating that liny RGs have an excess of
intermediate-age (0.1--5 Gyr) stellar populations. Liny RGs show higher dust
attenuation and $W3$ luminosities than their lineless counterparts. We also
find that the amount of warm gas needed to explain the observed \Ha luminosity
in liny RGs is $10^5$--$10^8$\msun, and that their \nii/\oii emission-line
ratios are typical of those of the most massive star-forming galaxies. Taken
together, these results rules out the following sources for the warm gas in
liny RGs: mass-loss from intermediate-mass stars, mergers with metal-poor
galaxies and intergalactic streams. They imply instead an inflow of enriched
gas previously expelled from the galaxy or a merger with a metal-rich galaxy.
The ionization source and the origin of the gas producing the emission lines

problem. Particularly when the target exhibits multimodality, then the
traditional methods can fail to explore the entire state space and this results
in a bias sample output. Methods to overcome this issue include the parallel
tempering algorithm which utilises an augmented state space approach to help
the Markov chain traverse regions of low probability density and reach other
modes. This method suffers from the curse of dimensionality which dramatically
slows the transfer of mixing information from the auxiliary targets to the
target of interest as $d \rightarrow \infty$. This paper introduces a novel
prototype algorithm, QuanTA, that uses a Gaussian motivated transformation in
an attempt to accelerate the mixing through the temperature schedule of a
parallel tempering algorithm. This new algorithm is accompanied by a
comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying the improved efficiency and
scalability of the approach; concluding that under weak regularity conditions
the new approach gives accelerated mixing through the temperature schedule.
Empirical evidence of the effectiveness of this new algorithm is illustrated on
canonical examples.

linked to the existence of nearly-flat bands, which make TBG a fresh playground
to investigate the interplay between correlations and superconductivity. The
low-energy narrow bands were shown to be well-described by an effective
tight-binding model on the honeycomb lattice (the dual of the triangular
Moir\'e superlattice) with a local orbital degree of freedom. In this paper, we
perform a strong-coupling analysis of the proposed $\left(p_{x},\,p_{y}\right)$
two-orbital extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. By decomposing the
interacting terms in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels, we
classify the different possible superconducting, magnetic, and charge
instabilities of the system. In the pairing case, we pay particular attention
to the two-component ($d$-wave) pairing channels, which admit vestigial phases
with nematic or chiral orders, and study their phenomenology. Furthermore, we
explore the strong-regime by obtaining a simplified spin-orbital exchange model
which may describe a putative Mott-like insulating state at quarter-filling.
Our mean-field solution reveals a rich intertwinement between ferro- and
antiferro-magnetic orders with different types of nematic and magnetic orbital
orders. Overall, our work provides a solid framework for further investigations
of the phase diagram of the two-orbital extended Hubbard model in both strong-

dispersive chain subject to a localized initial perturbation in the
displacement. Analytical solutions are obtained for both second order nonlinear
dispersive chain and homogenous harmonic chain. Solution was also compared with
numerical results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Locally dominant
phonon modes (k-space) are introduced based on these solutions. These locally
defined phonon modes k(x,t) spatially and temporally varying with x and t are
critical to the establishment of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The
establishment of LTE should require a uniform distribution of energy in these
modes at any given time t and location x. Wave propagation accompanying with
the nonequilibrium dynamics leads to the excitation of these locally defined
phonon modes. It was found that the system energy is redistributed among these
excited phonons modes (k-space). This redistribution process is only possible
with nonlinear dispersion and requires a finite amount of time to achieve a
steady state distribution depending on the spatial distribution (or frequency
content) of initial perturbation and the dispersion relation, where sharper and
concentrated perturbation leads to a faster redistribution. Ballistic type of
heat transport along the harmonic chain reveals that at any given position the
lowest mode (k=0) is excited first and gradually expanding to the highest mode,
which can only asymptotically approach the maximum mode of the first Brillouin
zone. Energy is shown to be uniformly distributed in all available phonon modes
lower than the highest mode. The energy flux along the chain is shown to be a
constant with time and proportional to the sound speed (ballistic transport).
Comparison with the Fourier's law leads to a time-dependent thermal
conductivity that diverges with time.

The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate

capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex

primarily differs from other previous works in that we organize instances into

to the bifurcation, the unstable manifold derived from the kinetic equation has
the same form as the OA manifold, implying thereby that the OA-ansatz form

while 78% of Class 0 and I protostars do not have signs of disks within our 12
AU disk diameter resolution limit, indicating that at 8 mm most disks in the
Class 0 and I phases are <10 AU in radius. These small radii may be a result of
surface brightness sensitivity limits. Modeled 8 mm radii are similar to the
radii of known Class 0 disks with detected Keplerian rotation. Since our 8 mm
data trace a population of larger dust grains which radially drift towards the
protostar and are lower limits on true disk sizes, large disks at early times
do not seem to be particularly rare. We find statistical evidence that Class 0

properties may be defined early in the Class 0 phase and do not undergo large
changes through the Class I phase. By combining our candidate disk properties

dramatic consequences for path integrals: A sum over spacetimes with fixed

merely demand that coordinates exist such that the metric at the boundary is

frequency is consistent with expectations based on a standard power-law radio
spectrum, the average correlation at 150MHz is not. We see evidence for
redshift evolution of the FIRC at 150MHz, and find that the FIRC varies with
stellar mass, dust temperature and specific star formation rate, whether the
latter is probed using MAGPHYS fitting, or using mid-infrared colour as a
proxy. We can explain the variation, to within 1$\sigma$, seen in the FIRC over
mid-infrared colour by a combination of dust temperature, redshift, and stellar
mass using a Bayesian partial correlation technique.

stellar mass ($M_\ast$) and is nearly constant for high-mass galaxies. Theory
suggests that this tight mass-metallicity relationship is shaped by galactic
outflows removing metal-enriched gas from galaxies. Here, we observationally
model the outflow metallicities of the warm outflowing phase from a sample of
seven local star-forming galaxies with stellar masses between
10$^{7}$-10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$. We estimate the outflow metallicities using four
weak rest-frame ultraviolet absorption lines, the observed stellar continua,
and photoionization models. The outflow metallicity is flat with $M_\ast$, with
a median metallicity of $1.0\pm0.6$ Z$_\odot$. The observed outflows are
metal-enriched: low and high-mass galaxies have outflow metallicities 10-50 and
2.6 times larger than their ISM metallicities, respectively. The observed
outflows are mainly composed of entrained ISM gas with at most 22% of the
metals directly coming from recent supernovae enrichment. The metal outflow
rate shallowly increases with $M_\ast$, as $M_\ast^{0.2 \pm 0.1}$, because the
mass outflow rate shallow increases with $M_\ast$. Finally, we normalize the
metal outflow rate by the rate at which star formation retains metals to
calculate the metal-loading factor. The metal-loading factor inversely scales
with $M_\ast$. The normalization and scaling of the metal-loading factor agree
with analytic expressions that reproduce observed mass-metallicity relations.
Galactic outflows fundamentally shape the observed mass-metallicity
relationship.

simulation suite of 36 high-resolution isolated merger simulations, exploring a
wide range of parameter space in terms of mass ratios (mu = 1:5, 1:10, 1:50,
1:100) and orbital parameters. We find that mini mergers deposit a higher
fraction of their mass in the outer halo compared to minor mergers, while their
contribution to the central mass distribution is highly dependent on the
orbital impact parameter: for larger pericentric distances we find that the
centre of the host galaxy is almost not contaminated by merger particles. We
also find that the median of the resulting radial mass distribution for mini
mergers differs significantly from the predictions of simple theoretical
tidal-force models. Furthermore, we find that mini mergers can increase the
size of the host disc significantly without changing the global shape of the
galaxy, if the impact occurs in the disc plane, thus providing a possible
explanation for extended low-surface brightness disks reported in observations.
Finally, we find clear evidence that streams are a strong indication of nearly
circular infall of a satellite (with large angular momentum), whereas the
appearance of shells clearly points to (nearly) radial satellite infall.

periodicity of the spiral dithering pattern used during the observation
(P$\sim$120 sec). Therefore, the artifact may arise from small-scale response
variations. Other artifacts include visit-long ""sagging"" or ""hump"" in flux,
occurring when the dithering pattern is not a spiral, or a one-time change in

causality of such artifacts, we apply Fourier transform analysis to both light

variations correlate with visit or instrumental parameters. Artifacts do not
correlate with source position on the detector. We suggest methods to identify
artifact variations and to correct them when possible.

and specific energy, which are scaled so as to be independent of host halo
mass. In this 2-dimensional space, the orbital properties of satellite galaxies
vary according to the host halo mass. The halo mass can be inferred by
calculating the likelihood that the observed satellite population is drawn from
this DF. Our method is robustly calibrated on mock EAGLE systems. We validate
it by applying it to the completely independent suite of 30 AURIGA
high-resolution simulations of MW-like galaxies: the method accurately recovers
their true mass and associated uncertainties. We then apply it to ten classical

motions from the GAIA satellite. The mass of the MW is estimated to be
$M_{200}^{\textnormal{MW}}=1.17_{-0.15}^{+0.21}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$ (68\%

singularities are solved. Moreover, the non-local quantum conformal theory
reveals itself to be ghost-free, so the unitarity of the theory is safe. After
the construction of UV-finite theory, we focused on making it manifestly
conformally invariant using the dilaton trick. We also argue that in this class
of theories conformal anomaly vanishes by fine-tuning the couplings. As
applications of this theory, the constraints of the conformal symmetry on the
form of the effective action and on the scattering amplitudes are shown. We
also remark about the preservation of the unitarity bound for scattering.

spectroscopic subsamples to calibrate the photometric redshifts for the full
sample. In this work we employ the Self Organizing Map (SOM) spectroscopic
sampling technique, to find the minimal number of spectra required for the
WFIRST weak lensing calibration. We use galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly
Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to build the
LSST+WFIRST lensing analog sample of ~36 k objects and train the LSST+WFIRST
SOM. We find that 26% of the WFIRST lensing sample consists of sources fainter
than the Euclid depth in the optical, 91% of which live in color cells already
occupied by brighter galaxies. We demonstrate the similarity between faint and
bright galaxies as well as the feasibility of redshift measurements at
different brightness levels. Our results suggest that the spectroscopic sample
acquired for calibration to the Euclid depth is sufficient for calibrating the
majority of the WFIRST color-space. For the spectroscopic sample to fully
represent the synthetic color-space of WFIRST, we recommend obtaining
additional spectroscopy of ~0.2-1.2 k new sources in cells occupied by mostly
faint galaxies. We argue that either the small area of the CANDELS fields and
the small overall sample size or the large photometric errors might be the
reason for no/less bright galaxies mapped to these cells. Acquiring the spectra
of these sources will confirm the above findings and will enable the
comprehensive calibration of the WFIRST color-redshift relation.

production of lanthanide nuclei, with atomic mass number A>140. However,
compelling evidence for the presence of heavier third-peak r-process elements
(e.g., gold, platinum) or translead nuclei remains elusive. At early times
(~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble
of beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense,
generating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single
power-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input
can possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays, 223Ra
(half-life t_{1/2}=11.43d), 225Ac (t_{1/2}=10.0d, following the beta-decay of
225Ra with t_{1/2}=14.9d), and the fissioning isotope 254Cf (t_{1/2}=60.5d),
which liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency
than beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which
constrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of
these individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In
order to constrain the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch &
wide-band observations are required with sensitive instruments like the James
Webb Space Telescope. In addition, by comparing the nuclear heating rate
obtained with an abundance distribution following the Solar r abundance
pattern, to the bolometric lightcurve of AT2017gfo, we find that the

balance cooling locally throughout the central 220kpc. However while the
signatures of AGN feedback (inflated bubbles) dominate the central 60kpc in
X-ray images, beyond this radius the intracluster medium is increasingly shaped
by the effects of gas sloshing, which can also produce subtle variations in
X-ray surface brightness. We use mock Chandra observations of gas sloshing
simulations to investigate what fraction of the observed density fluctuations
in the core of the Perseus galaxy cluster may originate from sloshing rather
than AGN induced feedback. Outside 60kpc, we find that the observed level of
the density fluctuations is broadly consistent with being produced by sloshing
alone. If this is the case, AGN-generated turbulence is likely to be
insufficient in combating cooling outside 60kpc.

multiple time scales ranging from a few ps to hundreds of ns and in some cases
even up to microseconds. The last part of decay is slow and is characterized by
a power law (PL). The microscopic origin of this PL is not yet clearly
understood. Here we present a theoretical study based on time dependent
statistical mechanics and computer simulations. Our investigations show that
the primary candidates responsible for this exotic nature of SD are the
counterions and ions from the buffer solution. We employ the model developed by
Oosawa for polyelectrolyte solution that includes effects of counterion
fluctuations to construct a frequency dependent dielectric function. We use it
in the continuum model of Bagchi, Fleming and Oxtoby only to find that it fails
to explain the slow PL decay of DNA solvation dynamics. We then extend the
model by employing the continuous time random walk technique developed by
Scher-Montroll-Lax. This approach can explain the long time PL decay, in terms
of the collective response of the counter ions. From MD simulations we find
frequent occurrence of random walk of tagged counter ions along the phosphate
backbone. We propose a generalized random walk model for counterion hopping and
carry out kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to show that the nonexponential
contribution to solvation dynamics can indeed arise from dynamics of such ions.
We also employ a Mode Coupling Theory analysis to understand the slow
relaxation that originates from ions in solution. Explicit evaluation suggests
that buffer ion contribution could explain logarithmic time dependence in the
ns time scale, but not a power law. From MD simulations we find log-normal
distributions of relaxation times of water dynamics inside the grooves. This is
responsible for the initial faster multiexponential decay of SD.

for nonlinear model reduction and state field approximation from measurements.
Empirical interpolation derives approximations from a few samples
(measurements) via interpolation in low-dimensional spaces. It has been
observed that empirical interpolation can become unstable if the samples are
perturbed due to, e.g., noise, turbulence, and numerical inaccuracies. The main
contribution of this work is a probabilistic analysis that shows that stable
approximations are obtained if samples are randomized and if more samples than
dimensions of the low-dimensional spaces are used. Oversampling, i.e., taking
more sampling points than dimensions of the low-dimensional spaces, leads to
approximations via regression and is known under the name of gappy proper
orthogonal decomposition. Building on the insights of the probabilistic
analysis, a deterministic sampling strategy is presented that aims to achieve
lower approximation errors with fewer points than randomized sampling by taking
information about the low-dimensional spaces into account. Numerical results of
reconstructing velocity fields from noisy measurements of combustion processes
and model reduction in the presence of noise demonstrate the instability of
empirical interpolation and the stability of gappy proper orthogonal
decomposition with oversampling.

and assess its importance on system performance. The reliability of an OWC

estimates, and also affects the ability of penalized methods such as the lasso
to recover the true sparsity pattern. A new estimation procedure called
SIMSELEX (SIMulation-SELection-EXtrapolation) is proposed. This procedure
augments the traditional SIMEX approach with a variable selection step based on
the group lasso. The SIMSELEX estimator is shown to perform well in variable
selection, and has significantly lower estimation error than naive estimators
that ignore measurement error. SIMSELEX can be applied in a variety of
errors-in-variables settings, including linear models, generalized linear
models, and Cox survival models. It is furthermore shown how SIMSELEX can be
applied to spline-based regression models. SIMSELEX estimators are compared to
the corrected lasso and the conic programming estimator for a linear model, and
to the conditional scores lasso for a logistic regression model. Finally, the

growth of speleothems --- mineral deposits found in caves that provide
important clues about past climate. While previous studies have used internal
temperature measurements to predict ventilation rates, such data would not be

parsimonious model to predict ventilation rates from knowledge of outside
temperatures and the cave's physical dimensions only. In the model, ventilation
arises from buoyancy-driven flows created in passageways that connect to the
outside. A few key simplifications leads to a system amenable to perturbation
analysis, resulting in explicit expressions for ventilation rates. We compare
these predictions to time-resolved, in-situ measurements of transported cave
gases (carbon dioxide and radon). The theory accurately accounts for the timing
and magnitude of seasonal and synoptic variations of these gases, and is
therefore diagnostic of seasonal bias in speleothem growth.

growth direction in the latter case. Extensive numerical simulations are
supplemented by analytical results for a sticky slider model in which particles
coalesce when they meet. Results for single particle displacement versus time
show to what extent particle dynamics is slaved to the surface, while scaling
properties of the probability distribution of the separation of two particles
have important implications for replica symmetry breaking for a pair of
trajectories. For the many-particle system, clustering in steady state is
studied via moments of particle number fluctuations in a single stretch,
revealing different degrees of spatial multiscaling with different driving.
Temporal intermittency in steady state is established by showing that the
scaled flatness diverges. Finally we consider the approach to the steady state,
and study both the flatness and the evolution of equal-time correlation
functions, as in coarsening of phase ordering systems. Our studies give clear
evidence for a simple scaling description of the approach to steady state, with
a diverging length scale. An investigation of aging properties reveals that
flatness is nonmonotonic in time with two distinct branches, and that a scaling

Space Telescope imaging from the PHAT survey of the M31 disk. We detect 373
X-ray sources down to 0.35-8.0 keV flux of 10$^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
over 0.4 square degrees, 170 of which are reported for the first time. We
identify optical counterpart candidates for 188 of the 373 sources, after using
the HST data to correct the absolute astrometry of our Chandra imaging to
0.1$""$. While 58 of these 188 are associated with point sources potentially in
M31, over half (107) of the counterpart candidates are extended background
galaxies, 5 are star clusters, 12 are foreground stars, and 6 are supernova
remnants. Sources with no clear counterpart candidate are most likely to be
undetected background galaxies and low-mass X-ray binaries in M31. The 58 point
sources that are not consistent with foreground stars are bright enough that
they could be high mass stars in M31; however, all but 8 have optical colors
inconsistent with single stars, suggesting that many could be background
galaxies or binary counterparts. For point-like counterparts, we examine the
star formation history of the surrounding stellar populations to look for a
young component that could be associated with a high mass X-ray binary. For the
40 point-like counterpart candidates associated with young populations, we find
that their age distribution has two peaks at 15-20 Myr and 40-50 Myr. If we
only consider the 8 counterpart candidates with typical high-mass main sequence
optical star colors, their age distribution peaks mimic those of the sample of
40. Finally, we find that intrinsic faintness, and not extinction, is the main
limitation for finding further counterpart candidates.

Our results demonstrate that a simple 45{\deg} rotation changes the magnetic

which exhibits mesoscopic domain growth mediated by domain wall nucleation and
coherent domain propagation. We observe several domain-wall configurations,
most of which are direct analogues to those seen in continuous ferromagnetic

constraints of the system. Changing the orientation of the external magnetic

employed to tune devices based on magnetotransport phenomena such as Hall

The optimality of the scaling relation between layer thickness and stiffness is
confirmed by suitable bending constructions. Beyond its theoretical interest,
this result constitutes a key ingredient for the homogenization of variational
problems modeling high-contrast bilayered composite materials, where the common
assumption of strict inclusion of one phase in the other is clearly not

the definition of time to count the number of small events between the large
ones, which provides for an analog to the concept of natural time introduced by
the geophysics community with the goal of predicting patterns in seismic
events. We analyze the distribution of time and natural time intervals both in
the case of models that include only nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as

volume-limited galaxy sample jointly observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. I eliminate the impact of the
Malmquist bias against HI-deficient systems on the $f_{gas}$ predictor by
properly accounting for the HI detection probability of each galaxy in the
analysis. The best-fitting $f_{gas}$ predictor, with an estimated scatter of
$0.272$ dex, provides excellent description to the observed HI mass function.
After defining an HI excess parameter as the deviation of the observed
$f_{gas}$ from the expected value, I confirm that there exists a strong
secondary dependence of the mass-metallicity relation on HI excess. By further
examining the 2D metallicity distribution on the specific star formation rate
vs. HI excess plane, I show that the metallicity dependence on HI is likely
more fundamental than that on specific star formation rate. In addition, I find
that the environmental dependence of HI in the local Universe can be
effectively described by the cross-correlation coefficient between HI excess
and the red galaxy overdensity $\rho_{cc}{=}-0.18$. This weak anti-correlation
also successfully explains the observed dependence of HI clustering on
$f_{gas}$. My method provides a useful framework for learning HI gas evolution

security-critical applications. Functional side channels arise when an attacker
knows that a secret value of a server stays fixed for a certain time. Then, the
attacker can observe the server executions on a sequence of different public
inputs, each paired with the same secret input. Thus for each secret, the
attacker observes a function from public inputs to execution time, for
instance, and she can compare these functions for different secrets. First, we
introduce a notion of noninterference for functional side channels. We focus on
the case of noisy observations, where we demonstrate with examples that there
is a practical functional side channel in programs that would be deemed
information-leak-free or be underestimated using the standard definition.
Second, we develop a framework and techniques for debugging programs for
functional side channels. We extend evolutionary fuzzing techniques to generate
inputs that exploit functional dependencies of response times on public inputs.
We adapt existing results and algorithms in functional data analysis to model
the functions and discover the existence of side channels. We use a functional
extension of standard decision tree learning to pinpoint the code fragments
causing a side channel if there is one. We empirically evaluate the performance
of our tool FUCHSIA on a series of micro-benchmarks and realistic Java
programs. On the set of benchmarks, we show that FUCHSIA outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques in detecting side channel classes. On the realistic
programs, we show the scalability of FUCHSIA in analyzing functional side
channels in Java programs with thousands of methods. Also, we show the
usefulness of FUCHSIA in finding side channels including a zero-day
vulnerability in OpenJDK and another vulnerability in Jetty that was since
fixed by the developers.

recording in general is often required, e.g., hours of spiking recordings of
neurons in neuronal networks. The issue of whether the MEP analysis can be

to be fully addressed. In this work, we investigate relationships underlying

the regularized zero-error entanglement cost can be computed exactly. We then
explore the question of increasing the Schmidt number by quantum operations. We
describe a class of bipartite quantum operations that preserve the Schmidt

at leading order, the angular distribution of the daughters in the decay of a

the parent's rest frame if the neutrinos are Majorana, independent of the
parent's polarization. If the neutrinos are Dirac fermions, this is, in

independent of the details of the physics responsible for the decay. We explore
the feasibility of using these angular distributions -- or, equivalently, the

address the Majorana versus Dirac nature of neutrinos if a fourth, heavier

these maps arises from the fact that iterating a quantum t-tensor product

product expanders in dimension D where t = polylog(D). We then show how
replacing the zigzag product by the generalised zigzag product leads to
almost-Ramanujan quantum tensor product expanders i.e. having near-optimal
almost quadratic tradeoff between the degree and the second largest singular

of infinitely many fully nontrivial $G$-invariant solutions to this system for
$p\geq 2^*$ up to some value which depends on the symmetries and on $\gamma$.

in density functional theory (DFT) dependent on the nonlocal nuclear density.
Often, approximations may be made when computing the density that may result in
spurious contributions in other DFT quantities. With the ability to compute the
nonlocal nuclear density from ab initio wave functions, it is now possible to
estimate effects of such spurious contributions. Purpose: We derive the kinetic
density using ab initio nonlocal scalar one-body nuclear densities computed
within the no-core shell model (NCSM) approach, utilizing two- and
three-nucleon chiral interactions as the sole input. With the ability to
compute translationally invariant nonlocal densities, it is possible to
directly gauge the impact of the spurious center-of-mass (COM) contributions in
DFT quantities such as the kinetic density. Methods: The nonlocal nuclear
densities are derived from the NCSM one-body densities calculated in second
quantization. We present a review of COM contaminated and translationally
invariant nuclear densities. We then derive an analytic expression for the
kinetic density using these nonlocal densities, producing an ab initio kinetic
density. Results: The ground state nonlocal densities of
\textsuperscript{4,6,8}He, \textsuperscript{12}C, and \textsuperscript{16}O are
used to compute the kinetic densities of the aforementioned nuclei. The impact
of the COM removal technique in the densities is discussed. The results of this
work can be extended to other fundamental quantities in DFT. Conclusions: The
use of a general nonlocal density allows for the calculation of fundamental
quantities taken as input in theories such as DFT. This allows benchmarking of
procedures for COM removal in different many-body techniques.

function of applied strain for simulated glasses mechanically deformed in

assumption that band broadening is controlled by the strain rate inside the
shear band. The second model describes the shear band as a pulled front
propagating into an unsteady state, the dynamics of which are described using
the effective temperature shear transformation zone (ET-STZ) theory. Both
models are compared to three simulated systems: a two-dimensional binary
Lennard-Jones glass, a Cu64Zr36 glass modeled using an embedded atom method
(EAM) potential, and a Si glass modeled using the Stillinger-Weber potential.
Shear bands form in all systems across a variety of quench rates. Depending on
the case these bands either appear to broaden indefinitely or to saturate to a
finite width. The shear band strain rate model appears to apply only when band
growth is unconstrained, indicating the dominance of a single time scale in the
early stages of band development. The front propagation model, which reduces to
the other model in the early stages of band broadening, also applies to cases
in which the band width saturates, suggesting that competition between the rate
of shear-induced configurational disordering and thermal relaxation sets a
maximum width for shear bands in a variety of materials systems.

  this form",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider disk stability in the quasi-linear formulation of MOND (QUMOND),
the basis for some $N$-body integrators. We generalize the Toomre criterion for
the stability of disks to tightly wound, axisymmetric perturbations. We apply
this to a family of thin exponential disks with different central surface
densities. By numerically calculating their QUMOND rotation curves, we obtain
the minimum radial velocity dispersion required for stability against local
self-gravitating collapse.
  MOND correctly predicts much higher rotation speeds in low surface brightness
galaxies (LSBs) than does Newtonian dynamics without dark matter. Newtonian
models thus require putative very massive halos, whose inert nature implies
they would strongly stabilize the disk.
  MOND also increases the stability of galactic disks, but in contradistinction
to Newtonian gravity, this extra stability is limited to a factor of 2. MOND is
thus rather more conducive to the formation of bars and spiral arms. Therefore,
observation of such features in LSBs could be problematic for Newtonian galaxy
models. This could constitute a crucial discriminating test. We quantitatively
account for these facts in QUMOND.
  We also compare numerical QUMOND rotation curves of thin exponential disks to
those predicted by two algebraic expressions commonly used to calculate MOND
rotation curves. For the choice that best approximates QUMOND, we find the
circular velocities agree to within 1.5% beyond $\approx 0.5$ disk scale
lengths, regardless of the central surface density. The other expression can
underestimate the rotational speed by up to 12.5% at one scale length, though
rather less so at larger radii.

  FAT*-19",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Settings such as lending and policing can be modeled by a centralized agent
allocating a resource (loans or police officers) amongst several groups, in
order to maximize some objective (loans given that are repaid or criminals that
are apprehended). Often in such problems fairness is also a concern. A natural
notion of fairness, based on general principles of equality of opportunity,
asks that conditional on an individual being a candidate for the resource, the
probability of actually receiving it is approximately independent of the
individual's group. In lending this means that equally creditworthy individuals
in different racial groups have roughly equal chances of receiving a loan. In
policing it means that two individuals committing the same crime in different
districts would have roughly equal chances of being arrested.
  We formalize this fairness notion for allocation problems and investigate its
algorithmic consequences. Our main technical results include an efficient
learning algorithm that converges to an optimal fair allocation even when the
frequency of candidates (creditworthy individuals or criminals) in each group
is unknown. The algorithm operates in a censored feedback model in which only
the number of candidates who received the resource in a given allocation can be
observed, rather than the true number of candidates. This models the fact that
we do not learn the creditworthiness of individuals we do not give loans to nor
learn about crimes committed if the police presence in a district is low.
  As an application of our framework, we consider the predictive policing
problem. The learning algorithm is trained on arrest data gathered from its own
deployments on previous days, resulting in a potential feedback loop that our
algorithm provably overcomes. We empirically investigate the performance of our
algorithm on the Philadelphia Crime Incidents dataset.

of engineering and scientific fields. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which
is a numerical algorithm for the spectral analysis of Koopman operators, has
been attracting attention as a way of obtaining global modal descriptions of
NLDSs without requiring explicit prior knowledge. However, since existing DMD
algorithms are in principle formulated based on the concatenation of scalar
observables, it is not directly applicable to data with dependent structures
among observables, which take, for example, the form of a sequence of graphs.
In this paper, we formulate Koopman spectral analysis for NLDSs with structures
among observables and propose an estimation algorithm for this problem. This
method can extract and visualize the underlying low-dimensional global dynamics
of NLDSs with structures among observables from data, which can be useful in
understanding the underlying dynamics of such NLDSs. To this end, we first
formulate the problem of estimating spectra of the Koopman operator defined in
vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and then develop an estimation
procedure for this problem by reformulating tensor-based DMD. As a special case
of our method, we propose the method named as Graph DMD, which is a numerical
algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis of graph dynamical systems, using a
sequence of adjacency matrices. We investigate the empirical performance of our

interdisciplinary nature. Existing technologies can differentiate
microparticles by their bulk properties, such as size, density, electric
polarizability, etc. The next level of challenge is to separate particles that
show identical bulk properties and differ only in subtle surface features, such
as functionalization with ligands. In this work, we propose a technique to sort
and separate particles and fluid droplets that differ in surface properties. As
a dispersive medium, we use a nematic liquid crystal (LC) rather than an
isotropic fluid, which allows us to amplify the difference in surface
properties through distinct perturbations of LC order around the dispersed
particles. The particles are placed in a LC cell with spatially distorted
molecular orientation subject to an alternating current electric field. The
gradients of the molecular orientation perform two functions. First, elastic
interactions between these pre-imposed gradients and distortions around the
particles separate the particles with different surface properties in space.
Second, these pre-imposed patterns create electro-osmotic flows powered by the
electric field that transport the sorted particles to different locations thus
separating them. The demonstrated unique sorting and separation capability
opens opportunities in lab-on-a-chip, cell sorting and bio-sensing
applications.

range of applications, the literature does not describe the generating
mechanism of the observed data from the network.
  In a previous article, the authors presented a technique which used a finite
mixture model as the connection between the unobserved network and the observed
social behavior. This model assumed that each group was the result of a star
graph on a subset of the population. Thus, each group was the result of a
leader who selected members of the population to be in the group. They called
these hub models.
  This approach treats the network values as parameters of a model. However,
this leads to a general challenge in estimating parameters which must be
addressed. For small datasets there can be far more parameters to estimate than
there are observations. Under these conditions, the estimated network can be
unstable.

collisions in 2018, and is expected to operate for the next decade. It is
anticipated to collect 50/ab of collision data over its lifetime. This book is
the outcome of a joint effort of Belle II collaborators and theorists through
the Belle II theory interface platform (B2TiP), an effort that commenced in
2014. The aim of B2TiP was to elucidate the potential impacts of the Belle II
program, which includes a wide scope of physics topics: B physics, charm, tau,
quarkonium, electroweak precision measurements and dark sector searches. It is
composed of nine working groups (WGs), which are coordinated by teams of
theorist and experimentalists conveners: Semileptonic and leptonic B decays,
Radiative and Electroweak penguins, phi_1 and phi_2 (time-dependent CP
violation) measurements, phi_3 measurements, Charmless hadronic B decay, Charm,
Quarkonium(like), tau and low-multiplicity processes, new physics and global
fit analyses. This book highlights ""golden- and silver-channels"", i.e. those
that would have the highest potential impact in the field. Theorists
scrutinised the role of those measurements and estimated the respective
theoretical uncertainties, achievable now as well as prospects for the future.
Experimentalists investigated the expected improvements with the large dataset
expected from Belle II, taking into account improved performance from the
upgraded detector.

incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). The problem can be formulated in a
reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where a policy-based agent sequentially
extends its inference path until it reaches a target. However, in an incomplete
KG environment, the agent receives low-quality rewards corrupted by false
negatives in the training data, which harms generalization at test time.
Furthermore, since no golden action sequence is used for training, the agent
can be misled by spurious search trajectories that incidentally lead to the
correct answer. We propose two modeling advances to address both issues: (1) we
reduce the impact of false negative supervision by adopting a pretrained
one-hop embedding model to estimate the reward of unobserved facts; (2) we
counter the sensitivity to spurious paths of on-policy RL by forcing the agent
to explore a diverse set of paths using randomly generated edge masks. Our
approach significantly improves over existing path-based KGQA models on several
benchmark datasets and is comparable or better than embedding-based models.

flexibility with the rollover data plan, which allows the unused data from the
previous month to be used in the current month. Motivated by this industry
trend, we propose a general framework for designing and optimizing the mobile
data plan with time flexibility. Such a framework includes the traditional data
plan, two existing rollover data plans, and a new credit data plan as special
cases. Under this framework, we formulate a monopoly MNO's optimal data plan
design as a three-stage Stackelberg game: In Stage I, the MNO decides the data
mechanism; In Stage II, the MNO further decides the corresponding data cap,
subscription fee, and the per-unit fee; Finally in Stage III, users make
subscription decisions based on their own characteristics. Through backward
induction, we analytically characterize the MNO's profit-maximizing data plan
and the corresponding users' subscriptions. Furthermore, we conduct a market
survey to estimate the distribution of users' two-dimensional characteristics,
and evaluate the performance of different data mechanisms using the real data.
We find that a more time-flexible data mechanism increases MNO's profit and
users' payoffs, hence improves the social welfare.

attention as one of the transparent oxide semiconductors since its bulk single
crystal shows a high carrier mobility (~320 cm2 V-1 s-1) with a high carrier
concentration (~10^20 cm-3). For this reason, many researchers have fabricated
LBSO epitaxial films thus far, but the obtainable carrier mobility is
substantially low compared to that of single crystals due to the formation of
the lattice/structural defects. Here we report that the mobility suppression in
LBSO films can be lifted by a simple vacuum annealing process. The vacuum
annealing of the LBSO films on MgO substrate increased the carrier
concentrations due to the oxygen vacancy formation, which leads to simultaneous
lateral grain growth. As a result, the carrier mobility was greatly improved by
the vacuum annealing, which does not occur after heat treatment in air. These
results expand our current knowledge on the point defect formation in epitaxial
LBSO films and show that vacuum annealing is a powerful tool for enhancing the
mobility values of LBSO films.

Furthermore, we characterize the role of the $Z_2$ symmetry in the
excitation-relaxation dynamics of the system as a function of light-matter
coupling. Importantly, we observe that initial states with even-odd parity
manifest qualitatively distinct transient and steady state behaviors, contrary
to the Hermitian dynamics that is only sensitive to whether the initial state
is parity-invariant. Moreover, the parity-sensitive dynamical behavior is not a
creature of ultrastrong coupling and is present even at weak coupling values.

increasing the tension (or decreasing the bending stiffness of the plate) the
plate evolves progressively from a plate into an elastic membrane as in drums.
We start from the plate and increase the tension in experiments and numerical
simulations. We observe that the system remains in a state of weak turbulence
of weakly dispersive waves. This observation is in contrast with what has been
observed in water waves when decreasing the water depth, which also changes the
waves from dispersive to weakly dispersive. The weak turbulence observed in the
deep water case evolves into a solitonic regime. Here no such transition is
observed for the stretched plate. We then apply the weak turbulence theory to
the membrane case and show with numerical simulations that indeed the weak
turbulence framework remains valid for the membrane and no formation of
singular structures (shocks) should be expected in contrast with acoustic wave
turbulence.

potential outcomes framework, this article shows that the traditional method of
comparing the proportions of ""wrong to right"" and ""right to wrong"" answer
changing patterns--a method that has recently been criticized by van der
Linden, Jeon, and Ferrara (2011)--indeed correctly identify the sign of the
average answer changing effect, but only for those examinees who actually
changed their initial responses. This subgroup effect is referred to as the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and generally differs from the
average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU), that is, those who did not
change their initial responses. Analyzing two real data sets, including van der
Linden et al.'s (2011) controversial data, this article finds that the ATT of
answer changing is positive while the ATU of answer changing is negative,
therefore, the debate on answer changing effects can be easily resolved. The
article also shows that answer changing and answer reviewing are two distinct
treatments and knowing answer changing effects is not informative for
predicting answer reviewing effects.

an average of homomorphisms on $C[0,1]$ in the strong operator topology,
additionally we require that this average also preserves the same subspace.
Such results could be useful for constructing homomorphisms for subhomogeneous

avalanche diode (MAPD) but has been ignored in recent analyses of MAPD to
simplify the Monte Carlo simulation. Here, the photocurrent characteristics of
GaN/AlN MAPD are investigated to understand the role of polarization field in
the MQW structure. Carrier multiplication in AlN/GaN MAPD is found as a result
of interfacial impact ionization not much helped from external field but
instead considerably contributed by the polarization field. In addition, the
movement of ionized electrons out of quantum well is proved as Fowler-Nordheim
tunneling process helped by the polarization field in AlN barrier. Furthermore,
the transport of ionized electrons through MQW structure is found influenced by
the reverse polarization field in GaN layer, which could be suppressed by the
external electric field. With all the three effects, the quick photocurrent
increase of GaN/AlN MAPD is ascribed to the efficient transport of
interfacial-ionized electrons step by step out of MQW at high voltages, which
is in big difference from conventional APD due to avalanche breakdown.

seed node, and the mixture distribution is possibly multi-modal. Moreover, (ii)
GLS converges to a Gaussian distribution independent of the seed node, under a
certain condition on the Markov process. Numerical experiments with both

to hold beyond the Markov conditions of the theorems.

creating algorithms that have high accuracy on relatively small datasets.
  This paper introduces Proximity Forest, an algorithm that learns accurate
models from datasets with millions of time series, and classifies a time series
in milliseconds. The models are ensembles of highly randomized Proximity Trees.
Whereas conventional decision trees branch on attribute values (and usually
perform poorly on time series), Proximity Trees branch on the proximity of time
series to one exemplar time series or another; allowing us to leverage the
decades of work into developing relevant measures for time series. Proximity
Forest gains both efficiency and accuracy by stochastic selection of both
exemplars and similarity measures.
  Our work is motivated by recent time series applications that provide orders
of magnitude more time series than the UCR benchmarks. Our experiments
demonstrate that Proximity Forest is highly competitive on the UCR archive: it
ranks among the most accurate classifiers while being significantly faster. We
demonstrate on a 1M time series Earth observation dataset that Proximity Forest
retains this accuracy on datasets that are many orders of magnitude greater

  The theoretical results modified by the parton energy loss effects are
consistent with the experimental data for E866 and RHIC energy, and the gluon

introduced in the scalar potential, permitting $\Delta B=2$ violating process
involving Standard Model quarks while avoiding stringent proton decay
constraints. Depending on their quantum number assignment, the diquark-type
scalars can couple to either right or left handed quarks, or to both. We show
that this model can provide a viable explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the
universe provided that the coupling to left handed quarks are present. However,
the coexistence of couplings to left and right handed quarks introduces
important phenomenological constraints on the model, such as radiative
contributions to quark masses and the generation of electric dipole moments for
nuclei, which probe the CP even and CP odd products of the relevant couplings
constants, respectively. We demonstrate that the strongest such constraints
arise from electric dipole moment measurements of the neutron and $^{199}$Hg.
These constraints are sufficiently strong that, in the absence of an intricate

dimensionality of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size,
which makes it extremely difficult to solve the Schr\""{o}dinger equations of
the system. But typically, many physical systems have a simplified internal
structure which makes the parameters needed to characterize their ground states
exponentially smaller. This makes many numerical methods possible in capture
the physics of the system. Among these modern numerical techniques, neural
networks, which show great power in approximating functions and extracting
features of the big data, are now attracting many interests. Neural network
representation of quantum many-body states shows great potential in solving
some traditionally difficult quantum problems involving large number of
freedoms. In this work, we briefly review the progress of using the artificial
neural network to build quantum many-body ansatz states. We take Boltzmann
machine representation as a prototypical example to illustrate various aspects
of neural network representation of quantum many-body states. We first briefly
review the classical neural networks, then we illustrate how to use neural
networks to represent quantum states and density operators. Some physical
properties of the neural network states, including entanglement features,
representational power, and the relation with tensor network states, are
discussed. For applications, we briefly review the progress of many-body
calculating based on neural network states, neural network state approach to
tomography, and also the classical simulation of quantum computing based on
Boltzmann machine states. At the end of the work, some outlooks and open
problems are given.

example, multisets are non-free data types because the multiset $\{a,b,b\}$ has
two other equivalent but literally different forms $\{b,a,b\}$ and $\{b,b,a\}$.
Pattern matching is known to provide a handy tool set to treat such data types.
Although many studies on pattern matching and implementations for practical
programming languages have been proposed so far, we observe that none of these
studies satisfy all the criteria of practical pattern matching, which are as
follows: i) efficiency of the backtracking algorithm for non-linear patterns,
ii) extensibility of matching process, and iii) polymorphism in patterns.
  This paper aims to design a new pattern-matching-oriented programming
language that satisfies all the above three criteria. The proposed language
features clean Scheme-like syntax and efficient and extensible pattern matching
semantics. This programming language is especially useful for the processing of
complex non-free data types that not only include multisets and sets but also
graphs and symbolic mathematical expressions. We discuss the importance of our
criteria of practical pattern matching and how our language design naturally
arises from the criteria. The proposed language has been already implemented
and open-sourced as the Egison programming language.

rely on the second order non-linear effect which is much more efficient. Our

to generate a coherent frequency comb with a precisely determined carrier

advanced thin-film technology for several years. In the present study,
150-nm-thick epitaxial HfN layers are grown on MgO(001) by reactive
high-impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) with no external substrate heating.
Maximum film growth temperatures Ts due to plasma heating range from 70-150
{\deg}C, corresponding to Ts/Tm = 0.10-0.12 (in which Tm is the HfN melting
point in K). During HiPIMS, gas and sputtered-metal ion fluxes incident at the
growing film surface are separated in time due to strong gas rarefaction and
the transition to a metal-ion dominated plasma. In the present experiments, a
negative bias of 100 V is applied to the substrate, either continuously during
the entire deposition or synchronized with the metal-rich portion of the ion
flux. Two different sputtering-gas mixtures, Ar/N2 and Kr/N2, are employed in
order to probe effects associated with the noble-gas mass and ionization
potential. The combination of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution
reciprocal-lattice maps, and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission
electron microscopy analyses establish that all HfN films have a cube-on-cube
orientational relationship with the substrate, i.e., [001]HfN||[001]MgO and
(100)HfN||(100)MgO. Layers grown with continuous substrate bias, in either
Ar/N2 or Kr/N2, exhibit a relatively high mosaicity and a high concentration of
trapped inert gas. In distinct contrast, layers grown in Kr/N2 with the
substrate bias synchronized to the metal-ion-rich portion of HiPIMS pulses,
have much lower mosaicity, no measurable inert-gas incorporation, and a
hardness of 25.7 GPa, in good agreement with results for epitaxial HfN(001)
layers grown at Ts = 650 C (Ts/Tm = 0.26).

speech signal in a complex acoustic environment, where multiple speakers and
background noise signals simultaneously interfere with the speech signal of
interest. A signal processing algorithm that can effectively increase the
speech intelligibility and quality of speech signals in such complicated
acoustic situations is highly desirable. Especially for applications involving
mobile communication devices and hearing assistive devices. Due to the
re-emergence of machine learning techniques, today, known as deep learning, the
challenges involved with such algorithms might be overcome. In this PhD thesis,
we study and develop deep learning-based techniques for two sub-disciplines of
the cocktail party problem: single-microphone speech enhancement and
single-microphone multi-talker speech separation. Specifically, we conduct
in-depth empirical analysis of the generalizability capability of modern deep
learning-based single-microphone speech enhancement algorithms. We show that
performance of such algorithms is closely linked to the training data, and good
generalizability can be achieved with carefully designed training data.
Furthermore, we propose uPIT, a deep learning-based algorithm for
single-microphone speech separation and we report state-of-the-art results on a
speaker-independent multi-talker speech separation task. Additionally, we show
that uPIT works well for joint speech separation and enhancement without
explicit prior knowledge about the noise type or number of speakers. Finally,
we show that deep learning-based speech enhancement algorithms designed to
minimize the classical short-time spectral amplitude mean squared error leads

a large number of samples during one iteration, without overestimating the

  based on multiple-pairs of transformations",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dimensionality reduction is a main step in the learning process which plays
an essential role in many applications. The most popular methods in this field
like SVD, PCA, and LDA, only can be applied to data with vector format. This
means that for higher order data like matrices or more generally tensors, data
should be fold to the vector format. So, in this approach, the spatial
relations of features are not considered and also the probability of
over-fitting is increased. Due to these issues, in recent years some methods
like Generalized low-rank approximation of matrices (GLRAM) and Multilinear PCA
(MPCA) are proposed which deal with the data in their own format. So, in these
methods, the spatial relationships of features are preserved and the
probability of overfitting could be fallen. Also, their time and space
complexities are less than vector-based ones. However, because of the fewer
parameters, the search space in a multilinear approach is much smaller than the
search space of the vector-based approach. To overcome this drawback of
multilinear methods like GLRAM, we proposed a new method which is a general
form of GLRAM and by preserving the merits of it have a larger search space.
Experimental results confirm the quality of the proposed method. Also, applying
this approach to the other multilinear dimensionality reduction methods like
MPCA and MLDA is straightforward.

the cosmological magnetic dynamo. Here we present a novel numerical approach to
astrophyiscal MHD simulations aimed to resolve this small-scale dynamo in
future cosmological simulations. As a first step, we implement a fifth order
WENO scheme in the new code WOMBAT. We show that this scheme doubles the
effective resolution of the simulation and is thus less expensive than common
second order schemes. WOMBAT uses a novel approach to parallelization and load
balancing developed in collaboration with performance engineers at Cray Inc.
This will allow us scale simulation to the exaflop regime and achieve kpc
resolution in future cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. Here we
demonstrate the excellent scaling properties of the code and argue that
resolved simulations of the cosmological small scale dynamo within the whole
virial radius are possible in the next years.

equilibrium can poten- tially result in the so-called singular horseshoe, which
means the existence of a non-uniformly hyperbolic chaotic invariant set.
However, it is very hard to find a specific dynamical system that exhibits such
singular cycles in general. In this paper, the existence of the singular cycles
involved in saddle periodic orbits is studied by two types of piecewise affine
systems: one is the piecewise affine system having an admissible saddle point
with only real eigenvalues and an admissible saddle periodic orbit, and the
other is the piecewise affine system having an admissible saddle- focus and an
admissible saddle periodic orbit. Precisely, several kinds of sufficient
conditions are obtained for the existence of only one heteroclinic cycle or
only two heteroclinic cycles in the two types of piecewise affine systems,
respectively. In addition, some examples are presented to illustrate the
results.

coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the largest eruptive phenomenon in the
heliosphere, are still undetermined. Low-altitude magnetic reconnection
associated with flux cancellation appears to play an important role in CME
occurrence as it can form an eruptive configuration and reduce the magnetic
flux that contributes to the overlying, stabilising field. We conduct the first
comprehensive study of 20 small bipolar active regions in order to probe the
role of flux cancellation as an eruption trigger mechanism. We categorise
eruptions from the bipolar regions into three types related to location and
find that the type of eruption produced depends on the evolutionary stage of
the active region. In addition we find that active regions that form eruptive
structures by flux cancellation (low-altitude reconnection) had, on average,
lower flux cancellation rates than the active region sample as a whole.
Therefore, while flux cancellation plays a key role, by itself it is
insufficient for the production of an eruption. The results support that
although flux cancellation in a sheared arcade may be able to build an eruptive
configuration, a successful eruption depends upon the removal of sufficient
overlying and stabilising field. Convergence of the bipole polarities also
appears to be present in regions that produce an eruption. These findings have
important implications for understanding the physical processes that occur on
our Sun in relation to CMEs and for space weather forecasting.

understand the differences between developers and determine to which extent
emoticons can be used as in place of sentiment analysis. Method: We extract
emoticons from 1.3M comments from Apache's issue tracker and 4.5M from
Mozilla's issue tracker using regular expressions built from a list of
emoticons used by SentiStrength and Wikipedia. We check for statistical
differences using Mann-Whitney U tests and determine the effect size with
Cliff's delta. Results: Overall Mozilla developers rely more on emoticons than
Apache developers. While the overall ratio of comments with emoticons is of 2%

above 20%. Looking specifically at Mozilla developers, we find that western

eastern developers. While the majority of emoticons are used to express joy, we
find that Mozilla developers use emoticons more frequently to express sadness

overall more emoticons during weekends than during weekdays, with the share of
sad and surprised emoticons increasing during weekends. Conclusions: While
emoticons are primarily used to express joy, the more occasional use of sad and

of sentiment analysis among developers using emoticons frequently enough.

effects on the optical emission. The irradiating flux in presence of an outflow

progressively less important in comparison with the intrinsic flux emitted from
the disc. After Main Sequence the evolutionary tracks of the optical

blue colors (F450W -- F555W $\simeq - 0.2 : +0.1$) and high luminosity ($M_{V}
\simeq - 4 : - 6.5$). Systems with more massive black holes accreting
supercritically from evolved donors of similar mass have comparable colours but
can reach $M_V \simeq - 8$. We apply our model to NGC 1313 X-2 and NGC 4559
X-7. Both sources are well represented by a system accreting above Eddington
from a massive evolved donor. For NGC 1313 X-2 the agreement is for a $\sim
20M_{\odot}$ black hole, while NGC4559 X-7 requires a significantly more
massive black hole.

implemented in all major browsers since over a year. To ensure the security,
performance, and correctness of future web applications, there is a strong need
for dynamic analysis tools for WebAssembly. Unfortunately, building such tools
from scratch requires knowledge of low-level details of the language, and
perhaps even its runtime environment. This paper presents Wasabi, the first
general-purpose framework for dynamically analyzing WebAssembly. Wasabi
provides an easy-to-use, high-level API that allows implementing heavyweight
dynamic analyses that can monitor all low-level behavior. The approach is based
on binary instrumentation, which inserts calls to analysis functions written in
JavaScript into a WebAssembly binary. Wasabi addresses several unique
challenges not present for other binary instrumentation tools, such as the
problem of tracing type-polymorphic instructions with analysis functions that
have a fixed type, which we address through an on-demand monomorphization of
analysis calls. To control the overhead imposed by an analysis, Wasabi
selectively instruments only those instructions relevant for the analysis. Our
evaluation on compute-intensive benchmarks and real-world applications shows
that Wasabi (i) faithfully preserves the original program behavior, (ii)
imposes an overhead that is reasonable for heavyweight dynamic analysis
(depending on the program and the analyzed instructions, between 1.02x and
163x), and (iii) makes it straightforward to implement various dynamic
analyses, including instruction counting, call graph extraction, memory access
tracing, and taint analysis.

of emotion classification. In addition, we build a term weighting approach
based on the different modifiers into a lexical model for the analysis of the

amplifiers separate emotions expressed with an emotion- bearing word more
clearly from other secondary connotations. Downtoners have the opposite effect.

instance we show empirically that ""not happy"" is closer to sadness than to

enough. The observed spectral evolution deviates from the model predictions
when the burst luminosity drops below a critical value of 20-70% of the maximum
luminosity. We suggest that these deviations are induced by the additional
heating of the accreted particles. We present a method for computation of the
neutron star atmosphere models heated by accreted particles assuming that their
energy is released via Coulomb interactions with electrons. We compute the
temperature structures and the emergent spectra of the atmospheres of various
chemical compositions and investigate the dependence of the results on the
other model parameters. We show that the heated atmosphere develops the hot

deeper, almost isothermal optically thick region with a temperature of a few

star atmospheres, with the main differences being the presence of a high-energy
tail and a strong excess in the low-energy part of the spectrum. They also lack
the iron absorption edge, which is visible in the spectra of undisturbed

use case diagram, a conceptual class diagram, use case definitions specified by
system sequence diagrams and the contracts of their system operations. We
propose a method to decompose a contract into executable parts and

executable part into pre-implemented primitive operations. A non-executable
part is usually realized by significant algorithms such as sorting a list,
finding the shortest path or domain-specific computation. It can be implemented
manually or by using existing code. A CASE tool is developed that provides an
interface for developers to develop a program for each non-executable part of a
contract, and automatically transforms the executables into sequences of
pre-implemented primitive operations. We have conducted four cases studies with
over 50 use cases. The experimental result shows that the 93.65% of requirement
specifications are executable, and only 6.35% are non-executable such as
sorting and event-call, which can be implemented by developers manually or
invoking the APIs of advanced algorithms in Java library. The one second

the relationships between their wrist movements during unscripted daily

modeling and hierarchically stacking Gaussian process models for three classes

hybrid content-based approaches, which usually yield to lower recommendation
quality than collaborative ones. Some techniques to optimize performance of
this type of approaches have been studied in recent past. One of them is called
feature weighting, which assigns to every feature a real value, called weight,
that estimates its importance. Statistical techniques for feature weighting
commonly used in Information Retrieval, like TF-IDF, have been adapted for
Recommender Systems, but they often do not provide sufficient quality
improvements. More recent approaches, FBSM and LFW, estimate weights by
leveraging collaborative information via machine learning, in order to learn
the importance of a feature based on other users opinions. This type of models

lattice, in which, the adjacent sites are not equidistant. Starting with an
undistorted lattice, the position of the lattice sites are shifted through a
tunable parameter $\alpha$ to create a distorted empty lattice. In this model,
two neighboring sites are considered to be connected to each other in order to
belong to the same cluster, if both of them are occupied as per the criterion
of usual percolation and the distance between them is less than or equal to a
certain value, called connection threshold $d$. While spanning becomes
difficult in distorted lattices as is manifested by the increment of the
percolation threshold $p_c$ with $\alpha$, an increased connection threshold
$d$ makes it easier for the system to percolate. The scaling behavior of the
order parameter through relevant critical exponents and the fractal dimension
$d_f$ of the percolating cluster at $p_c$ indicate that this new type of
percolation may belong to the same universality class as ordinary percolation.
This model can be very useful in various realistic applications since it is
almost impossible to find a natural system that is perfectly ordered.

a joint input-output embedding. The model is a generalized form of weight tying
which shares parameters but allows learning a more flexible relationship with
input word embeddings and allows the effective capacity of the output layer to
be controlled. In addition, the model shares weights across output classifiers

HCN and H$^{13}$CN to show that no depletion of N is required (assuming an
interstellar abundance of $7.5\times10^{-5}$ per H). These results suggest that
an appreciable fraction of O is sequestered in water ice in large grains
settled to the disk mid-plane. Similarly, a fraction of the available C is
locked up in less volatile molecules. By contrast, N remains largely
unprocessed, likely as N$_2$. This pattern of depletion suggests the presence
of true abundance variations in this disk, and not a simple overall depletion
of gas mass. If these results hold more generally, then combined CO, C$_2$H,
and HCN observations of disks may provide a promising path for constraining
gas-phase C/O and N/O during planet-formation. Together, these tracers offer
the opportunity to link the volatile compositions of disks to the atmospheres

nuclear structure studies of exotic nuclei. However, most microscopic studies
of low-energy nuclear reactions neglect the tensor force, resulting in a lack
of knowledge concerning the effect of the tensor force on HIC...... Purpose:
The theoretical study of the influence of the tensor force on heavy-ion
interaction potentials is required to further our understanding of the
microscopic mechanisms entailed in fusion dynamics. Method: The full Skyrme
tensor force is implemented into the static Hartree-Fock and dynamic
density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) theory to calculate
both static (frozen density) and dynamic microscopic interaction potentials for
reactions involving exotic and stable nuclei. Results: The static potentials
are found to be systematically higher than the dynamical results, which are
attributed to the microscopic dynamical effects included in TDHF. We also show
that the dynamical potential barriers vary more significantly by the inclusion
of tensor force than the static barriers. The influence of isoscalar and
isovector tensor terms is also investigated with the TIJ set of forces. For
light systems, the tensor force is found to have an imperceptible effect on the
nucleus-nucleus potential. However, for medium and heavy spin-unsaturated
reactions, the potentials may change from a fraction of an MeV to almost 2 MeV
by the inclusion of tensor force, indicating a strong impact of the tensor
force on sub-barrier fusion. Conclusions: The tensor force could indeed play a
large role in the fusion of nuclei, with spin-unsaturated systems seeing a
systematic increase in ion-ion barrier height and width. This fusion hindrance
is partly due to static, ground state effects from the inclusion of the tensor
force, though additional hindrance appears when studying nuclear dynamics.

correlation structure in the multipartite scenario. We introduce a versatile
technique to build families of Bell inequalities witnessing different notions
of multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties. The idea behind our
method is simple: a known Bell inequality satisfying certain constraints, for
example the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, serves as the $seed$ to
build new families of inequalities for more parties. The constructed
inequalities have a clear operational meaning, capturing an essential feature
of multipartite correlations: their violation implies that numerous subgroups
of parties violate the inequality chosen as seed. The more multipartite
nonlocal the correlations, the more subgroups can violate the seed. We
illustrate our construction using different seeds and designing Bell
inequalities to detect $m$-way nonlocal multipartite correlations, in
particular, $genuine$ $multipartite$ $nonlocal$ correlations -- the strongest
notion of multipartite nonlocality. For one of our inequalities we prove
analytically that a large class of pure states that are genuine multipartite
entangled exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties,
even for some states that are almost product. We also provide numerical
evidence that this family is violated by all genuine multipartite entangled
pure states of three and four qubits. Our results make us conjecture that this
family of Bell inequalities can be used to prove the equivalence between
genuine multipartite pure-state entanglement and nonlocality for any number of
parties.

properties on kiloparsec scales in a sample of 28 star forming galaxies at
$z\sim$ 2-2.6, using adaptive optics assisted integral field observations from
SINFONI on the VLT. The narrow and broad components of the H$\alpha$ emission
are used to simultaneously determine the local star formation rate surface
density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), and the outflow velocity $v_{\rm out}$ and mass
outflow rate $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$, respectively. We find clear evidence for
faster outflows with larger mass loading factors at higher $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$.
The outflow velocities scale as $v_{\rm out}$ $\propto$ $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34
\pm 0.10}$, which suggests that the outflows may be driven by a combination of
mechanical energy released by supernova explosions and stellar winds, as well
as radiation pressure acting on dust grains. The majority of the outflowing
material does not have sufficient velocity to escape from the galaxy halos, but
will likely be re-accreted and contribute to the chemical enrichment of the
galaxies. In the highest $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ regions the outflow component
contains an average of $\sim$45% of the H$\alpha$ flux, while in the lower
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ regions only $\sim$10% of the H$\alpha$ flux is associated
with outflows. The mass loading factor, $\eta$ = $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$/SFR, is
positively correlated with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ but is relatively low even at the
highest $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$: $\eta \lesssim$ 0.5 $\times$ (380 cm$^{-3}$/n$_e$).
This may be in tension with the $\eta$ $\gtrsim$ 1 required by cosmological
simulations, unless a significant fraction of the outflowing mass is in other
gas phases and has sufficient velocity to escape the galaxy halos.

a good SSE with nearly symmetric spin-up and spin-down currents; while as the
carbon dopant concentration increases (c.f. n $\geq$ 2), a high rotational
symmetry of the carbons contributes to generate the SSE with more symmetric
thermal spin-up and spin-down currents, otherwise towards the thermal SFE.
Moreover, some metallic BNNTs can generate the SSE or the SFE with finite
threshold temperatures, due to the compensation effect around the Fermi level.
More importantly, we find that the compression strain engineering is an
effective route to improve these effects and to realize the transition between

where a massive core forms first and then accretes a gaseous envelope. This
core forms by accreting solids, either planetesimals, or pebbles. A key
constraint in this model is that the accretion of gas must proceed before the
dissipation of the gas disc. Classical planetesimal accretion scenario predicts
that the time needed to form a giant planets core is much longer than the time
needed to dissipate the disc. This difficulty led to the development of another
accretion scenario, in which cores grow by accretion of pebbles, which are much
smaller and thus more easily accreted, leading to a more rapid formation. The
aim of this paper is to compare our updated pebble-based planet formation model
with observations, in particular the well studied metallicity effect. We adopt
the Bitsch et al. 2015a disc model and the Bitsch et al. 2015b pebble model and
use a population synthesis approach to compare the formed planets with
observations. We find that keeping the same parameters as in Bitsch et al.
2015b leads to no planet growth due to a computation mistake in the pebble flux
(Bitsch et al. 2017). Indeed a large fraction of the heavy elements should be
put into pebbles (Zpeb/Ztot = 0.9) in order to form massive planets using this
approach. The resulting mass functions show a huge amount of giants and a lack
of Neptune mass planets, which are abundant according to observations. To
overcome this issue we include the computation of the internal structure for
the planetary atmosphere to our model. This leads to the formation of Neptune
mass planets but no observable giants. Reducing the opacity of the planetary
envelope finally matches observations better. We conclude that modeling the
internal structure for the planetary atmosphere is necessary to reproduce
observations.

incompressible Navier--Stokes equations leads to the observation that a
semi-norm and corresponding equivalence classes of forces are fundamental for
their nonlinear dynamics. The recent concept of {\em pressure-robustness}
allows to distinguish between space discretisations that discretise these
equivalence classes appropriately or not. This contribution compares the
accuracy of pressure-robust and non-pressure-robust space discretisations for
transient high Reynolds number flows, starting from the observation that in
generalised Beltrami flows the nonlinear convection term is balanced by a
strong pressure gradient. Then, pressure-robust methods are shown to outperform
comparable non-pressure-robust space discretisations. Indeed, pressure-robust
methods of formal order $k$ are comparably accurate than non-pressure-robust
methods of formal order $2k$ on coarse meshes. Investigating the material
derivative of incompressible Euler flows, it is conjectured that strong
pressure gradients are typical for non-trivial high Reynolds number flows.
Connections to vortex-dominated flows are established. Thus,
pressure-robustness appears to be a prerequisite for accurate incompressible
flow solvers at high Reynolds numbers. The arguments are supported by numerical
analysis and numerical experiments.

the Point Spread Function (PSF) becomes strongly elongated due to the
anisoplanatism effect. This one must be modelled accurately to extrapolate the
PSF anywhere across the Field of view (FOV) and improve the science
exploitation. However, anisoplanatism is a function of the Cn2(h) profile, that
is not directly accessible from single conjugate AO telemetry. One may rely on
external profilers, but recent studies have highlighted more than 10% of
discrepancies with AO internal measurements, while we aim better than 1% of
accuracy for PSF modelling. To tackle this existing limitation, we present the
Focal plane profiling (FPP), as a $C_n^2(h)$ profiling method that relies on
post-AO focal plane images. We demonstrate such an approach complies with a
1%-level of accuracy on the $C_n^2(h)$ estimation and establish how this
accuracy varies regarding the calibration stars magnitudes and positions in the
field. We highlight that photometry and astrometry errors due to PSF
mis-modelling reaches respectively 1% and 50{\mu}as using FPP on a Keck
baseline, with a preliminary calibration using a star of magnitude H=14 at 20"".
We also validate this concept using Canadas NRC-Herzberg HENOS testbed images
in comparing FPP retrieval with alternative $C_n^2(h)$ measurements on HeNOS.
The FPP approach allows to profile the $C_n^2(h)$ using the SCAO systems and
improve significantly the PSF characterisation. Such a methodology is also
ELT-size compliant and will be extrapolated to tomographic systems in a near
future.

simulation setup rules for truly converged estimates of effective CSS by
Kinetic Monte-Carlo, and then we grid on a wide set of radii, rotation
energies, diffusion coefficients and concentrations of both reaction partners.
Symmetric roles of some parameters are used to infer a generic form for a
semi-analytical expression of CSS depending on all these interaction
parameters: it is composed of the various analytical limiting cases established
and fitted transition functions that allow a gradual switching between them.
The analysis of the residuals shows that the overall agreement is reasonably
good: it is only in the transition zones that discrepancies are located and
this is due to the asymmetry of the actual transition functions. The expression
can be easily extended to temperatures at least a few hundred degrees around
the reference. But further extending the CSS evaluations to much smaller
diffusion coefficients ratios, we see that the domain for 1D-1D mobility is
very extended: for a $10^{-3}$ ratio the computed CSS is still not correctly
described by the 1D-CSS with respect to a fixed sink (1D-0), but rather by the
established 1D-1D expression. For our typical sets of conditions, it is only
when approaching a ratio of $10^{-6}$ that the 1D-0 CSS starts to become more
relevant. This highlights the counter-intuitive fact that the growth kinetics
of moderately trapped 1D mobile loops, whose effective mobility is greatly
reduced, may not be described by 1D-0 kinetics but rather by appropriately
corrected 1D-1D CSS which have completely different order of magnitude and
kinetic orders.

influence of familiar individuals who maintain similar beliefs. This is unlike
the bounded-confidence models which solely rely on interactions based on
closeness of opinions. The influence network evolves either when similar-minded
individuals acquaint or when they fall out over their beliefs. This yields an
adaptive network to which are assigned dynamic centrality scores and varying
influence strengths. A mix of individuals - rigid and flexible - is assumed to
constitute groups - liberal and conservative. We analyse emergent group
behaviours subject to different initial conditions, agent types, their
densities and tolerances. The model accurately predicts the role of rigid
agents in hampering consensus. Also, a few structural properties of the dynamic
network, which result as a consequence of the proposed model have been

of an unknown function on a compact domain from a few evaluations inside the
domain. When little is known about the function, space-filling design is
advisable: typically, points of evaluation spread out across the available
space are obtained by minimizing a geometrical (for instance, covering radius)
or a discrepancy criterion measuring distance to uniformity. The paper
investigates connections between design for integration (quadrature design),
construction of the (continuous) BLUE for the location model, space-filling
design, and minimization of energy (kernel discrepancy) for signed measures.
Integrally strictly positive definite kernels define strictly convex energy
functionals, with an equivalence between the notions of potential and
directional derivative, showing the strong relation between discrepancy
minimization and more traditional design of optimal experiments. In particular,
kernel herding algorithms, which are special instances of vertex-direction
methods used in optimal design, can be applied to the construction of point
sequences with suitable space-filling properties.

framework in margin based kernel methods. In model formulation, given an
initial kernel matrix, a data-adaptive matrix with two constraints is imposed
in an entry-wise scheme. Learning this data-adaptive matrix in a
formulation-free strategy enlarges the margin between classes and thus improves
the model flexibility. The introduced two constraints are imposed either
exactly (on small data sets) or approximately (on large data sets) in our
model, which provides a controllable trade-off between model flexibility and
complexity with theoretical demonstration. In algorithm optimization, the
objective function of our learning framework is proven to be gradient-Lipschitz
continuous. Thereby, kernel and classifier/regressor learning can be
efficiently optimized in a unified framework via Nesterov's acceleration. For
the scalability issue, we study a decomposition-based approach to our model in
the large sample case. The effectiveness of this approximation is illustrated
by both empirical studies and theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on
various classification and regression benchmark data sets demonstrate that our
non-parametric kernel learning framework achieves good performance when

moments exhibit extremely rich self-assembly behaviour and are relevant to a
wide range of experimental systems, including charged and super-paramagnetic
colloids at liquid interfaces. However, there is a gap in our understanding of
the crystallization of these systems because existing theories such as integral
equation theory and lattice sum methods can only be used to study the high
temperature fluid phase and the zero-temperature crystal phase, respectively.
In this paper we bridge this gap by developing a density functional theory
(DFT), valid at intermediate temperatures, in order to study the
crystallization of one and two-component dipolar colloidal monolayers. The
theory employs a series expansion of the excess Helmholtz free energy
functional, truncated at second order in the density, and taking as input
highly accurate bulk fluid direct correlation functions from simulation.
Although truncating the free energy at second order means that we cannot
determine the freezing point accurately, our approach allows us to calculate ab
initio both the density profiles of the different species and the symmetry of
the final crystal structures. Our DFT predicts hexagonal crystal structures for
one-component systems, and a variety of superlattice structures for
two-component systems, including those with hexagonal and square symmetry, in
excellent agreement with known results for these systems. The theory also
provides new insights into the structure of two-component systems in the
intermediate temperature regime where the small particles remain molten but the
large particles are frozen on a regular lattice.

interesting, they need not be troublesome magnitudes for careful applications

oscillation spectrum. We do this by propagating $\nu_{\mu}$ from the world's
most intense neutrino beam at Fermilab, over a baseline of 810 km to northern
Minnesota, USA, and measure the $\nu_{\mu}$ to $\nu_{e}$ oscillation
probability. NOvA announced its latest oscillation results, based on
8.85$\times10^{20}$ (6.9$\times10^{20}$) protons on target neutrino
(antineutrino) data. Preliminary results for the allowed values of oscillation
parameters are: $\Delta m^2_{32}=2.51^{+0.12}_{-0.08}\times 10^{-3}
\mathrm{eV}^2$, $\mathrm{sin}^2\theta_{23} = 0.58 \pm 0.03$ (upper octant), and
$\delta_{\rm{CP}}=0.17\pi$ with preference to the normal hierarchy. Reliable
constraints on these oscillation parameters require a rigorous treatment of
systematic uncertainties and thorough cross-checks. In this paper, we present
an overview of the treatment of systematic uncertainties as well as
cross-checks using muon removed simulations and cosmic muon bremsstrahlung
showers.

centro-symmetric geometric models and an axisymmetric radiative transfer code.
CHARA's 330 m baselines enable us to place strong constraints on the viewing
geometry, revealing a disk inclined at 58 degrees from face-on with a 160
degree major axis position angle. Disk models imposing vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium provide poor fits to the SED. Models accounting for disk scale
height inflation, possibly induced by turbulence associated with
magneto-rotational instabilities, and invoking grain growth to >1 micron size
in the disk rim are required to simultaneously reproduce the SED and measured
visibility profile. However, visibility residuals for our best model fits to
the SED indicate the presence of unexplained NIR emission, particularly along
the apparent disk minor axis, while closure phase residuals indicate a more
centro-symmetric emitting region. In addition, our inferred 58 degree disk
inclination is inconsistent with a disk-based origin for the UX Ori-type
variability exhibited by HD 142666. Additional complexity, unaccounted for in
our models, is clearly present in the NIR-emitting region. We propose the disk
is likely inclined toward a more edge-on orientation and/or an optically thick
outflow component also contributes to the NIR circumstellar flux.

systems. In the presence of integrability, expectation values of local
operators equilibrate to values described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble,
which retains extensive memory about the initial state of the system. On the
other hand, in generic systems such expectation values relax to stationary
values described by the thermal ensemble, fixed solely by the energy of the
state. At the heart of understanding this dichotomy is the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH): individual eigenstates in nonintegrable
systems are thermal, in the sense that expectation values agree with the
thermal prediction at a temperature set by the energy of the eigenstate. In
systems where ETH is violated, thermalization can be avoided. Thus establishing
the range of validity of ETH is crucial in understanding whether a given
quantum system thermalizes. Here we study a simple model with confinement, the
quantum Ising chain with a longitudinal field, in which ETH is violated.
Despite an absence of integrability, there exist rare (nonthermal) states that
persist far into the spectrum. These arise as a direct consequence of
confinement: pairs of particles are confined, forming new `meson' excitations
whose energy can be extensive in the system size. We show that such states are
nonthermal in both the continuum and in the low-energy spectrum of the
corresponding lattice model. We highlight that the presence of such states
within the spectrum has important consequences, with certain quenches leading
to an absence of thermalization and local observables evolving anomalously.

observables, a priori determined from the stabilizer state and which can be
realized using single-qubit gates. Based on the proposed validation scheme, we
derive an explicit expression for the worst-case fidelity, i.e., the minimum

generated by univariate polynomials $\{p_i(x_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ is a
\emph{univariate ideal}. We study the ideal membership problem for the
univariate ideals and show the following results.
  \item Let $f(X)\in\mathbb{F}[\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_r]$ be a (low rank)
polynomial given by an arithmetic circuit where $\ell_i : 1\leq i\leq r$ are
linear forms, and $I=\langle p_1(x_1), \ldots, p_n(x_n)\rangle$ be a univariate

\pmod I$ can be evaluated at $\vec{\alpha}$ in deterministic time
$d^{O(r)}\cdot poly(n)$, where $d=\max\{\deg(f),\deg(p_1)\ldots,\deg(p_n)\}$.
This yields an $n^{O(r)}$ algorithm for minimum vertex cover in graphs with
rank-$r$ adjacency matrices. It also yields an $n^{O(r)}$ algorithm for
evaluating the permanent of a $n\times n$ matrix of rank $r$, over any field
$\mathbb{F}$. Over $\mathbb{Q}$, an algorithm of similar run time for low rank
permanent is due to Barvinok[Bar96] via a different technique.

$k$ ($k$ treated as fixed parameter) and $I=\langle p_1(x_1), \ldots,

uses $poly(n,k)$ space.

  In this paper we use machine learning, and deep learning in particular, to
discover PDEs hidden in complex data sets from measurement data. We include

to coordinate transformations in the discovered PDE, and we elaborate on

absorption from water, carbon monoxide, and methane in the atmosphere of the
directly imaged exoplanet HR8799b using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) with
OSIRIS on the Keck II telescope. We recently devised a new method to analyse
IFU data, called molecule mapping, searching for high-frequency signatures of
particular molecules in an IFU data cube.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to use the molecule mapping technique to
search for the previously detected spectral signatures in HR8799b using the
same data, allowing a comparison of molecule mapping with previous methods.
  Methods. The medium-resolution H- and K-band pipeline-reduced archival data
were retrieved from the Keck archive facility. Telluric and stellar lines were
removed from each spectrum in the data cube, after which the residuals were
cross-correlated with model spectra of carbon monoxide, water, and methane.
  Results. Both carbon monoxide and water are clearly detected at high
signal-to-noise, however, methane is not retrieved.
  Conclusions. Molecule mapping works very well on the OSIRIS data of exoplanet
HR8799b. However, it is not evident why methane is detected in the original
analysis, but not with the molecule mapping technique. Possible causes could be
the presence of telluric residuals, different spectral filtering techniques, or
the use of different methane models. We do note that in the original analysis
methane was only detected in the K-band, while the H-band methane signal could
be expected to be comparably strong. More sensitive observations with the JWST
will be capable of confirming or disproving the presence of methane in this
planet at high confidence.

generates Centre of Mass (CoM) trajectories, foot swing trajectories and the
Base of Support (BoS) over time. The data show that the proposed architecture
can generate behaviour in line with human walking strategies for both the CoM

a human trajectory, yet the proposed model significantly reduces the error in
the estimation of the CoM vertical trajectory compared to the inverted pendulum

body kinematics embedding in currently used in the clinical practice. However,
the model also implies a shift in the interpretation of the spatiotemporal
parameters of the gait, which are now determined by the conditions for the

difficult optimization problem: there is an especially bad local optimum where
the variational posterior always equals the prior and the model does not use
the latent variable at all, a kind of ""collapse"" which is encouraged by the KL
divergence term of the objective. In this work, we experiment with another
choice of latent distribution, namely the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution,
which places mass on the surface of the unit hypersphere. With this choice of
prior and posterior, the KL divergence term now only depends on the variance of
the vMF distribution, giving us the ability to treat it as a fixed
hyperparameter. We show that doing so not only averts the KL collapse, but
consistently gives better likelihoods than Gaussians across a range of modeling
conditions, including recurrent language modeling and bag-of-words document

researchers are engaged in revealing causal relations. The most challenging
problem is inferring the type of the causal relationship: whether it is uni- or
bi-directional or only apparent - implied by a hidden common cause only. Modern
technology provides us tools to record data from complex systems such as the
ecosystem of our planet or the human brain, but understanding their functioning
needs detection and distinction of causal relationships of the system
components without interventions. Here we present a new method, which
distinguishes and assigns probabilities to the presence of all the possible
causal relations between two or more time series from dynamical systems. The
new method is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to EEG
(electroencephalographic) data recorded in epileptic patients. Given the
universality of our method, it may find application in many fields of science.

produces on the overlying turbulence is studied using a modified triple
decomposition of the flow. This decomposition separates the roughness-induced
contribution from the background turbulence, with the latter essentially free
of any texture footprint. For small roughness, the background turbulence is not
significantly altered, but merely displaced closer to the roughness crests,
with the change in drag being proportional to this displacement. As the
roughness size increases, the background turbulence begins to be modified,
notably by the increase of energy for short, wide wavelengths, which is
consistent with the appearance of a shear-flow instability of the mean flow. A
laminar model is presented to estimate the roughness-coherent contribution, as
well as the displacement height and the velocity at the roughness crests. Based
on the effects observed in the background turbulence, the roughness function is
decomposed into different terms to analyse different contributions to the
change in drag, laying the foundations for a predictive model.

activities of daily living. The algorithm was evaluated using egocentric video
recordings from 9 participants with cSCI, obtained in a home simulation
laboratory. The system produces a binary hand-object interaction decision for
each video frame, based on features reflecting motion cues of the hand, hand
shape and colour characteristics of the scene. This output was compared with a
manual labelling of the video, yielding F1-scores of 0.74 $\pm$ 0.15 for the

amount of total interaction as a percentage of testing time, the average
duration of interactions in seconds, and the number of interactions per hour.
Moderate and significant correlations were found when comparing these output

deep spatio-temporal convolutional autoencoders to learn spatial and temporal

conductivity is assumed to be a random field K consisting of random variables
of a total large number N. Both steady and transient solutions T are expressed
in terms of the homogenized solution and its spatial derivatives, where
homogenized solution is obtained by solving the homogenized equation with
effective thermal conductivity. Both mean and variance of stochastic solutions
can be obtained analytically for K field consisting of identically distributed
(i.i.d) random variables. The mean and variance of T are shown to be dependent
only on the mean and variance of these i.i.d variables, not the particular form
of probability distribution function of i.i.d variables. Variance of
temperature field T can be separated into two contributions: the ensemble
contribution (through the homogenized temperature ); and the configurational
contribution (through different configrations) . The configurational
contribution is shown to be proportional to the local gradient of homogenized
solution. Large uncertainty of T field was found at locations with large
gradient of homogenized solution due to the significant configurational
contributions at these locations. Numerical simulations were implemented based

Monte Carlo results and the proposed stochastic analysis.

dynamical system, thereby quantifying the complexity of chaotic dynamics. One
approach to computing topological entropy in a two-dimensional space is to
analyze the collective motion of an ensemble of system trajectories taking into
account how trajectories ""braid"" around one another. In this spirit, we
introduce the Ensemble-based Topological Entropy Calculation, or E-tec, a
method to derive a lower-bound on topological entropy of two-dimensional
systems by considering the evolution of a ""rubber band"" (piece-wise linear
curve) wrapped around the data points and evolving with their trajectories. The
topological entropy is bounded below by the exponential growth rate of this
band. We use tools from computational geometry to track the evolution of the
rubber band as data points strike and deform it. Because we maintain
information about the configuration of trajectories with respect to one
another, updating the band configuration is performed locally, which allows
E-tec to be more computationally efficient than some competing methods. In this
work, we validate and illustrate many features of E-tec on a chaotic lid-driven
cavity flow. In particular, we demonstrate convergence of E-tec's approximation
with respect to both the number of trajectories (ensemble size) and the
duration of trajectories in time.

to field theories in the continuum. First, a short-distance length scale
$1/\Lambda$ is introduced in the continuum partition function by smearing the
fields. The resulting object is still defined in the continuum but has no
fluctuations at distances shorter than $1/\Lambda$. An infinitesimal
coarse-graining step is then generated by the combined action of a $rescaling$

field redefinition. As demonstrated for a free boson in two dimensions,
continuous TNR exactly preserves translation and rotation symmetries and can
generate a proper RG flow. Moreover, from a critical fixed point of this RG
flow one can then extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field

Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for determining cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) quality-parameters - naming chest compression frequency and
depth - as measured by an inertial sensor placed at the wrist is presented.
Once included into a smartphone or smartwatch app, the proposed algorithm will
enable bystanders to improve CPR (as part of a continuous closed-loop
support-system). By evaluating the precision of the model with data recorded by
a Laerdal Resusci Anne mannequin as reference standard, a low variance for
compression frequency of $\pm 2.0$ cpm has been found for the sensor placed at
the wrist, making this previously unconsidered position a suitable alternative
to the typical placement in the hand for CPR-training smartphone apps.

team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited communication range that
must autonomously coordinate to service task requests. We first show a general
approach to cast this dynamic problem as a sequence of decentralized task
allocation problems. Then we present two solutions both based on modeling the
allocation task as a Markov Random Field to subsequently assess decisions by
means of the decentralized Max-Sum algorithm. Our first solution assumes
independence between requests, whereas our second solution also considers the
UAVs' workloads. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that our workload-based
solution consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in a wide
range of scenarios, lowering the average service time up to 16%. In the
best-case scenario there is no gap between our decentralized solution and
centralized techniques. In the worst-case scenario we manage to reduce by 25%
the gap between current decentralized and centralized techniques. Thus, our
solution becomes the method of choice for our problem.

  Office, No: -2017/17601, Date: 09.11.2017",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new artificial neuron model capable of learning its
receptive field in the topological domain of inputs. The model provides
adaptive and differentiable local connectivity (plasticity) applicable to any
domain. It requires no other tool than the backpropagation algorithm to learn
its parameters which control the receptive field locations and apertures. This
research explores whether this ability makes the neuron focus on informative
inputs and yields any advantage over fully connected neurons. The experiments
include tests of focusing neuron networks of one or two hidden layers on
synthetic and well-known image recognition data sets. The results demonstrated
that the focusing neurons can move their receptive fields towards more
informative inputs. In the simple two-hidden layer networks, the focusing
layers outperformed the dense layers in the classification of the 2D spatial
data sets. Moreover, the focusing networks performed better than the dense
networks even when 70$\%$ of the weights were pruned. The tests on
convolutional networks revealed that using focusing layers instead of dense
layers for the classification of convolutional features may work better in some
data sets.

detector and we will compare its characteristics with a prefabricated design in
order to obtain better performance of our new proposed design. Differences
between our new work and prefabricated device are in both physical structure by
introducing an exponentially graded base SiGe-HBT instead of linearly graded
ones, and configuration of components by means of merging two transistor of the
initial common base structure into a single transistor with two base contacts,
which equivalent to two transistors in common emitter configuration. New
proposed detector, at first will be analyzed with a compact circuit model and
then for more accurate analysis, two dimensional carrier transport analysis
will be performed with numerical methods. Comparison of new and prefabricated
detector will be done by simulation of both new and prefabricated devices with
the same simulator. Because of only a slight change in transistor physical
structure, if our simulation results and previous empirical data have a good
matching for prefabricated device then with a high degree of precision we can
claim our comparison is verified, but of course, for better confirmation of our
ideas, fabrication and experimental measurements should be done in the next
steps. Responsivity and minimum noise equivalent power of new detector are
about 4.9A/W and 6.5pW/Hz1/2 respectively, while these characteristics for
prefabricated detector, are about 1A/W and 50pW/Hz1/2 respectively. Also about
231uW/pixel decrement in power consumption for the same responsivity, and a
same bandwidth have been achieved.

to its thermochromic property induced by metal-insulator transition (MIT).
However, its practical application is greatly limited by the relatively high
critical transition temperature (~68oC), low luminous transmittance (<60%) and
poor solar energy regulation ability (<15%). Here we developed a reversible and
non-volatile electric-field control on the MIT of monoclinic VO2 film. With a
solid electrolyte layer assisted gating treatment, we modulated the
insertion/extraction of hydrogens into/from VO2 lattice at room temperature,
causing tri-state phase transitions accompanied with controllable transmission
adjustment. The dramatic increase of visible/infrared transmittance during the
phase transition from the metallic (lightly H-doping) to insulating (heavily
H-doping) phase leads to an increased solar energy regulation ability up to
26.5%, while keep 70.8% visible-luminous transmittance. These results beat all
previous records and even exceeded the theoretical limit for traditional VO2
smart window, removing intrinsic disadvantages of VO2 for energy-saving
utilizations. Our findings not only demonstrated an electric-field controlled
phase modulation strategy, but also open the door for high-performance
VO2-based smart window applications.

resolution of coherent diffraction imaging with the ability of dark field
microscopy to map grains within thick polycrystalline specimens. An x-ray
objective serves to isolate a grain and avoid overlap of diffraction spots.
Iterative oversampling routines are used to reconstruct the shape and strain
field within the grain from the far field intensity pattern. The limitation on
resolution caused by the finite numerical aperture of the objective is overcome
by the Fourier synthesis of several diffraction patterns. We demonstrate the
method by an experimental study of a ~500 nm Pt grain for the two cases of a
real and a virtual image plane. In the latter case the spatial resolution is 13
nm rms. Our results confirm that no information on the pupil function of the
lens is required and that lens aberrations are not critical.
