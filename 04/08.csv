algorithms which are based on directional derivatives of the objective

any given point and for any given direction, a stochastic approximation for the

descent methods which use only derivatives in coordinate directions. For this
setting, we propose a non-accelerated and an accelerated directional derivative
method and provide their complexity bounds. Our non-accelerated algorithm has a
complexity bound which is similar to the gradient-based algorithm, that is,
without any dimension-dependent factor. Our accelerated algorithm has a
complexity bound which coincides with the complexity bound of the accelerated
gradient-based algorithm up to a factor of square root of the problem
dimension. We extend these results to strongly convex problems.

framework to model sequential decision making in uncertain environments.
Solving POMDPs online is an active area of research and given the size of
real-world problems approximate solvers are used. Recently, a few approaches
have been suggested for solving POMDPs by using MDP solvers in conjunction with
imitation learning. MDP based POMDP solvers work well for some cases, while
catastrophically failing for others. The main failure point of such solvers is
the lack of motivation for MDP solvers to gain information, since under their
assumption the environment is either already known as much as it can be or the
uncertainty will disappear after the next step. However for solving POMDP
problems gaining information can lead to efficient solutions. In this paper we
derive a set of conditions where MDP based POMDP solvers are provably
sub-optimal. We then use the well-known tiger problem to demonstrate such
sub-optimality. We show that multi-resolution, budgeted information gathering
cannot be addressed using MDP based POMDP solvers. The contribution of the
paper helps identify the properties of a POMDP problem for which the use of MDP
based POMDP solvers is inappropriate, enabling better design choices.

concept which allows to tackle a broad class of problems. The framework has
been initially designed to handle submodular optimization under various types
of constraints, that is, intersections of exchange systems (including
matroids), knapsacks, and unsplittable flows on trees. Later on, it turned out
that this framework perfectly extends to optimization under uncertainty, like
stochastic probing and online selection problems, which further can be applied
to mechanism design.
  We add to this line of work by showing how to create contention resolution
schemes for intersection of matroids and knapsacks when we work in the random
order setting. More precisely, we do know the whole universe of elements in
advance, but they appear in an order given by a random permutation. Upon
arrival we need to irrevocably decide whether to take an element or not. We
bring a novel technique for analyzing procedures in the random order setting
that is based on the martingale theory. This unified approach makes it easier
to combine constraints, and we do not need to rely on the monotonicity of
contention resolution schemes.
  Our paper fills the gaps, extends, and creates connections between many
previous results and techniques. The main application of our framework is a
$k+4+\varepsilon$ approximation ratio for the Bayesian multi-parameter
unit-demand mechanism design under the constraint of $k$ matroids intersection,
which improves upon the previous bounds of $4k-2$ and $e(k+1)$. Other results
include improved approximation ratios for stochastic $k$-set packing and
submodular stochastic probing over arbitrary non-negative submodular objective
function, whereas previous results required the objective to be monotone.

theory. It is proved that the 5 types of vortices recently proposed by Manton
are symmetry reductions of (A)SDYM equations with suitable gauge groups and
symmetry groups acting as isometries in a 4-manifold. As a consequence, the
twistor integrability results of such vortices can be derived. It is presented
a natural definition of their kinetic energy and thus the metric of the moduli
space was calculated by the Samols' localisation method. Then, a modified
version of the Abelian-Higgs model is proposed in such a way that spontaneous
symmetry breaking and the Bogomolny argument still hold. The Painlev\'e test,
when applied to its soliton equations, reveals a complete list of its
integrable cases. The corresponding solutions are given in terms of third
Painlev\'e transcendents and can be interpreted as original vortices on
surfaces with conical singularity.
  The last two chapters present the following results in projective
differential geometry and Hamiltonians of hydrodynamic-type (HT) systems. It is
shown that the projective structures defined by the Painlev\'e equations are
not metrisable unless either the corresponding equations admit first integrals
quadratic in first derivatives or they define projectively flat structures. The
corresponding first integrals can be derived from Killing vectors associated to
the metrics that solve the metrisability problem. Secondly, it is given a
complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary affine
connection in 2D to admit, locally, 0, 1, 2 or 3 Killing forms. These
conditions are tensorial and simpler than the ones in previous literature. By
defining suitable affine connections, it is shown that the problem of existence
of Killing forms is equivalent to the conditions of the existence of
Hamiltonian structures for HT systems of two components.

massive unlabeled 3D CT volumes are usually easily accessible. Current
mainstream works to address the semi-supervised biomedical image segmentation
problem are mostly graph-based. By contrast, deep network based semi-supervised
learning methods have not drawn much attention in this field. In this work, we
propose Deep Multi-Planar Co-Training (DMPCT), whose contributions can be
divided into two folds: 1) The deep model is learned in a co-training style
which can mine consensus information from multiple planes like the sagittal,
coronal, and axial planes; 2) Multi-planar fusion is applied to generate more
reliable pseudo-labels, which alleviates the errors occurring in the
pseudo-labels and thus can help to train better segmentation networks.
Experiments are done on our newly collected large dataset with 100 unlabeled
cases as well as 210 labeled cases where 16 anatomical structures are manually
annotated by four radiologists and confirmed by a senior expert. The results
suggest that DMPCT significantly outperforms the fully supervised method by
more than 4% especially when only a small set of annotations is used.

peripheral regions of the Bullet cluster 1E 0657$-$55.8. Ring formations are
spanning between 1--3 Mpc away from the center of the cluster, significantly
further away from the two already reported relics. Integrated fluxes of four of
the sub-regions in the inner `ring' from 4.5 to 10 GHz have also been reported.
To understand the possible origin of these structures, here we present a maiden
attempt of numerical modelling of a 3D and realistic `bullet' like event in a
full cosmological ($\Lambda$CDM) environment with N-body plus hydrodynamics
code. We report a simulated `bullet' found inside a (128 Mpc)$^3$ volume
simulation with a speed of 2700 km s$^{-1}$, creating a high supersonic bow
shock of Mach $M=3.5$ and a clear evidence of temporal separation of dark
matter and baryons, assuring no challenge to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology from the
bullet event as of now. We are also able to unveil the physics behind the
formation of these observed multiple shock structures. Modelled radio emissions
in our simulation support a complex combination of merger-associated processes
that accelerates and re-accelerates fossil and cosmic-ray electrons. With a
time evolution study and the computed radio emissions, we have shown that the
ring like formation around the bullet is originated due to the interaction of
the strong merger shocks with the accretion shocks at the periphery. The
multiple shock structures observed are possibly originated from multiple
mergers that have taken place at different times and much before the bullet
event.

a range of hard samples rather than being stuck with a small set of very hard

background magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_{0}$ in such systems. Methods: The
instability is investigated analytically in the framework of kinetic theory
applied to the hydrogen plasmas penetrated by hot proton beams. Results: The
instability arises at parallel wavenumbers $k_{z}$ that are sufficiently large
to demagnetize the beam ions, $k_{z}V_{Tb}/\omega_{Bi}\gtrsim $ $1$ (here
$V_{Tb}$ is the beam thermal speed along $\mathbf{B}_{0}$ and $\omega _{Bi}$ is
the ion-cyclotron frequency). The Alfv\'en mode is then made unstable by the
imbalance of perturbed currents carried by the magnetized background electrons
and partially demagnetized beam ions. The destabilizing effects of the beam
temperature and the temperature dependence of the instability threshold and
growth rate are demonstrated for the first time. The beam temperature, density,
and bulk speed are all destabilizing and can be combined in a single
destabilizing factor $\alpha_{b}$ triggering the instability at {$\alpha _{b}>$
$\alpha _{b}^{\mathrm{thr}}$}, where the threshold varies in a narrow range
$2.43\leq $ $\alpha _{b}^{\mathrm{thr}}\leq $ $4.87$. New analytical
expressions for the instability growth rate and its boundary in the parameter
space are obtained and can be directly compared with observations. Two
applications to terrestrial foreshocks and foreshocks around supernova remnants
are shortly discussed. In particular, our results suggest that the ions
reflected by the shocks around supernova remnants can drive stronger

literature in this regard is based on sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential tail

inequalities for sums of independent random variables under much more general
exponential type (namely sub-Weibull) tail assumptions. These results extract a
part sub-Gaussian tail behavior in finite samples, matching the asymptotics
governed by the central limit theorem, and are compactly represented in terms
of a new Orlicz quasi-norm - the Generalized Bernstein-Orlicz norm - that
typifies such tail behaviors.
  We illustrate the usefulness of these inequalities through the analysis of
four fundamental problems in HD statistics. In the first two problems, we study
the rate of convergence of the sample covariance matrix in terms of the maximum
elementwise norm and the maximum k-sub-matrix operator norm which are key
quantities of interest in bootstrap, HD covariance matrix estimation and HD
inference. The third example concerns the restricted eigenvalue condition,
required in HD linear regression, which we verify for all sub-Weibull random
vectors through a unified analysis, and also prove a more general result
related to restricted strong convexity in the process. In the final example, we
consider the Lasso estimator for linear regression and establish its rate of
convergence under much weaker than usual tail assumptions (on the errors as
well as the covariates), while also allowing for misspecified models and both
fixed and random design. To our knowledge, these are the first such results for
Lasso obtained in this generality. The common feature in all our results over

match the usual ones under sub-Gaussian assumptions.

This would make it the most metal-poor globular cluster known in the Milky Way.
This result was verified with comparisons to three other metal-poor globular
clusters that had been observed and analyzed in the same manner. We also
present new photometry of the cluster from EFOSC2 and SkyMapper and confirm
that the cluster is located $22.9\pm2.1$ kpc from the Sun and $15.2\pm2.1$ kpc
from the Galactic centre, and has a radial velocity of $92.5\substack{+2.4 \\

half that previously estimated, and we find that the cluster has a dynamical
mass of the cluster of $(12\pm2)\times10^3$ solar masses. Unfortunately, we
lack reliable proper motions to fully characterize its orbit about the Galaxy.

Hostile
actors, such as extremist groups or foreign governments, utilize these networks
to run propaganda campaigns with different aims. For extremists, these
campaigns are designed for recruiting new members or inciting violence. For
foreign governments, the aim may be to create instability in rival nations.
Proper social network counter-measures are needed to combat these threats. Here
we present one important counter-measure: penetrating social networks. This
means making target users connect with or follow agents deployed in the social
network. Once such connections are established with the targets, the agents can
influence them by sharing content which counters the influence campaign. In
this work we study how to penetrate a social network, which we call the
follow-back problem. The goal here is to find a policy that maximizes the
number of targets that follow the agent.
  We conduct an empirical study to understand what behavioral and network
features affect the probability of a target following an agent. We find that
the degree of the target and the size of the mutual neighborhood of the agent
and target in the network affect this probability. Based on our empirical
findings, we then propose a model for targets following an agent. Using this
model, we solve the follow-back problem exactly on directed acyclic graphs and
derive a closed form expression for the expected number of follows an agent
receives under the optimal policy. We then formulate the follow-back problem on
an arbitrary graph as an integer program. To evaluate our integer program based
policies, we conduct simulations on real social network topologies in Twitter.
We find that our polices result in more effective network penetration, with
significant increases in the expected number of targets that follow the agent.

problem with multiple communication channels. Departing from the classical
remote estimation paradigm, which involves one communication channel (noiseless
or noisy), we consider here the more realistic setting of two channels with
different characteristics (one is cheap but noisy, the other one is costly but
noiseless). We first show, via a counter-example, that the common folklore of
applying symmetric threshold-based policy, which is well known to be optimal
(for unimodal state densities) in the classical remote estimation problem, can
no longer be optimal in our setting. In view of that, and in order to make the
problem tractable, we introduce a side channel which signals to the receiver
the sign of the underlying state. We show, under some technical assumptions,
that a threshold-in-threshold based communication scheduling is optimal. The
impact of the results is analyzed numerically based on dynamic programming.
This numerical analysis reveals some rather surprising results inheriting known
properties from the single channel settings, such as not exhausting all the
opportunities available for the noisy channel.

linear stabilization terms are added. These terms are shown to be crucial to
remove the oscillations caused by the anisotropic coefficients, numerically.
The novelty of the proposed schemes is that all nonlinear terms can be treated
semi-explicitly, and one only needs to solve three decoupled linear equations
with constant coefficients at each time step. We further prove the
unconditional energy stabilities rigorously, and present various 2D and 3D

we search flares in light curves with both LC data and SC data, and compare

the energies of flares by 25\%, and underestimated the amplitudes of flares by

50\% compared with SC flares. However, the above percentages are poorly

although LC data cannot reflect the detailed profiles of flares, they also can
capture the basic properties of stellar flares.

tension is first derived by applying the Hankel integral transform, and
subsequently used to formulate the governing integral equation for the
axisymmetric contact problem. By using a numerical method based on

Grade-of-Service Steiner tree, and Multi-Tier tree. Several approximation
results are known. We first present two simple $O(\ell)$-approximation
heuristics. Based on these, we introduce a rudimentary composite algorithm that
generalizes the above heuristics, and determine its approximation ratio by
solving a linear program. We then present a method that guarantees the same
approximation ratio using at most $2\ell$ Steiner tree computations. We compare
these heuristics experimentally on various instances of up to 500 vertices
using three different network generation models. We also present various
integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for the MLST problem, and compare
their running times on these instances. To our knowledge, the composite
algorithm achieves the best approximation ratio for up to $\ell=100$ levels,
which is sufficient for most applications such as network visualization or
designing multi-level infrastructure.

the imminent rapid energy release which calls for different regime of plasma
processes to be at play. Due to subtle emission during the precursor phase, its
diagnostics remain delusive, revealing either the non-thermal electrons (NTEs)
or the thermal conduction to be the driver. In this regard, we investigate the
chromospheric response during various phases of a B6.4 flare on August 20,
2005. Spatio-temporal investigation of flare ribbon enhancement during the
precursor phase, carried out using spectra-images recorded in several
wavelength positions on the H-alpha line profile, revealed its delayed response
(180 seconds) compared to the X-ray emission, as well as sequential increment
in the width of the line-profile which are indicative of a slow heating
process. However, energy contained in the H-alpha emission during the precursor
phase reach as high as 80% of that estimated during the main phase.
Additionally, the plasma hydrodynamics during the precursor phase, as resulted
from the application of a single-loop one-dimensional model, revealed the
presence of power-law extension in the model generated X-ray spectra, with flux
lower than the RHESSI background. Therefore, our multi-wavelength diagnostics
and hydrodynamical modeling of the precursor emission indicates the role of a
two-stage process. Firstly, reconnection triggered NTEs, although too small in
flux to overcome the observational constraints, thermalize in the upper
chromosphere. This leads to the generation of a slow conduction front which
causes plasma heating during the precursor phase.

polynomial expansion and a set of discrete velocity with isotropy are adopted
to solve the kinetic moments of discrete equilibrium distribution function.
Such a model possesses both an adjustable specific heat ratio and Prandtl
number, and can be applied to a wide range of flow regimes including
continuous, slip, and transition flows. To recover results for actual
situations, the nondimensionalization process is demonstrated. To verify and
validate the new model, several typical non-equilibrium flows including the
Couette flow, Fourier flow, unsteady boundary heating problem, cavity flow, and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are simulated. Comparisons are made between the
results of discrete Boltzmann model and those of previous models including
analytic solution in slip flow, Lattice ES-BGK, and DSMC based on both BGK and
hard-sphere models. The results show that the new model can accurately capture
the velocity slip and temperature jump near the wall, and show excellent
performance in predicting the non-equilibrium flow even in transition flow
regime. In addition, the measurement of non-equilibrium effects is further
developed and the non-equilibrium strength $D^*_n$ in the n-th order moment
space is defined. The nonequilibrium characteristics and the advantage of using
$D^*_n$ in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are discussed. It concludes that the
non-equilibrium strength $D^*_n$ is more appropriate to describe the interfaces

curves and the isenthalpic curves. We utilize two different approaches to
derive the explicit expression of the Joule-Thomson coefficient and show that
both approaches are consistent with each other. The divergent point and the
zero point of the Joule-Thomson coefficient are discussed. The former is shown
to reveal the information of Hawking temperature while the latter is depicted
through the so-called inversion curves. Fine structures of the inversion curves
are disclosed in the cases $d>4$. At low pressure, the inversion temperature
increases with the dimensionality $d$ while at high pressure it decreases with
$d$. The ratio between minimum inversion temperature $T_{min}$ and the critical
temperature $T_c$ is discussed with its explicit expression obtained for $d>4$.
Surprisingly, it is shown that the ratio is not always equal to $1/2$ but
decreases with the dimensionality $d$. Moreover, isenthalpic curves of $d>4$
are shown to expand toward higher pressure when the dimensionality $d$
increases.

prior studies only consider cognitive radio networks equipped with
omni-directional antennas causing high interference at SUs. We name such CRNs
with omni-directional antennas as Omn-CRNs. Compared with an omni-directional
antenna, a directional antenna can concentrate the transmitting/receiving
capability at a certain direction, consequently resulting in less interference.
In this paper, we investigate the connectivity of SUs in CRNs with directional

of the connectivity of SUs of both Dir-CRNs and Omn-CRNs, thus enabling
tractability. We show that the connectivity of SUs is mainly affected by two
constraints: the spectrum availability of SUs and the topological connectivity
of SUs. Extensive simulations validate the accuracy of our proposed models.
Meanwhile, we also show that Dir-CRNs can have higher connectivity than
Omn-CRNs mainly due to the lower interference, the higher spectrum availability
and the higher topological connectivity brought by directional antennas.

scales to be understood in terms of the structure of a theory. A natural
application of the clockwork mechanism is to the freeze-in mechanism for dark
matter production. Here we consider a Higgs portal freeze-in dark matter model
based on a scalar clockwork sector with a mass scale which is less than the
Higgs boson mass. The dark matter scalar is the lightest scalar of the
clockwork sector. Freeze-in dark matter is produced by the decay of thermal
Higgs bosons to the clockwork dark matter scalars. We show that the mass of the
dark matter scalar is typically in the 1-10 keV range and may be warm enough to
have an observable effect on perturbation growth and Lyman-$\alpha$
observations. Clockwork Higgs portal freeze-in models have a potentially
observable collider phenomenology, with the Higgs boson decaying to missing
energy in the form of pairs of long-lived clockwork sector scalars, plus a
distribution of different numbers of quark and lepton particle-antiparticle
pairs. The branching ratio to different numbers of quark and lepton pairs is
determined by the clockwork sector parameters (the number of clockwork scalars
$N$ and the clockwork charge $q$), which could therefore be determined
experimentally if such Higgs decay modes are observed. In the case of a minimal
Standard Model observable sector, the combination of nucleosynthesis and
Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints is likely to exclude on-shell Higgs decays to
clockwork scalars, although off-shell Higgs decays would still be possible.
On-shell Higgs decays to clockwork scalars can be consistent with cosmological
constraints in simple extensions of the Standard Model with light singlet
scalars.

Compared to other microscopy techniques, DDM avoids particle tracking but
provides parameters commonly acquired in light scattering experiments. Based on
the spatial Fourier transform of image differences, the intermediate scattering
function and subsequently the MSD is calculated. Then the usual microrheology
procedure and the empirical Cox-Merz rule yield the steady-shear viscosity.
This method, $\eta$-DDM, is tested and illustrated using three different

of square degrees of the Northern hemisphere from the dedicated JAST/T80
telescope at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre. T80Cam is a 2 sq.deg
field-of-view camera mounted on this 83cm-diameter telescope, and is equipped
with a unique system of filters spanning the entire optical range. This filter
system is a combination of broad, medium and narrow-band filters, optimally
designed to extract the rest-frame spectral features (the 3700-4000\AA\ Balmer
break region, H$\delta$, Ca H+K, the G-band, the Mgb and Ca triplets) that are
key to both characterize stellar types and to deliver a low-resolution
photo-spectrum for each pixel of the sky observed. With a typical depth of AB
$\sim 21.25$ mag per band, this filter set thus allows for an indiscriminate
and accurate characterization of the stellar population in our Galaxy, it
provides an unprecedented 2D photo-spectral information for all resolved
galaxies in the local universe, as well as accurate photo-z estimates
($\Delta\,z\sim 0.01-0.03$) for moderately bright (up to $r\sim 20$ mag)
extragalactic sources. While some narrow band filters are designed for the
study of particular emission features ([OII]/$\lambda$3727,
H$\alpha$/$\lambda$6563) up to $z < 0.015$, they also provide well-defined
windows for the analysis of other emission lines at higher redshifts. As a
result, J-PLUS has the potential to contribute to a wide range of fields in
Astrophysics, both in the nearby universe (Milky Way, 2D IFU-like studies,
stellar populations of nearby and moderate redshift galaxies, clusters of
galaxies) and at high redshifts (ELGs at $z\approx 0.77, 2.2$ and $4.4$, QSOs,
etc). With this paper, we release $\sim 36$ sq.deg of J-PLUS data, containing
about $1.5\times 10^5$ stars and $10^5$ galaxies at $r<21$ mag.

computer described by an Ising Hamiltonian with $N$ sites and the coordination
number $Z$. The method is based on the $1/Z$ expansion for the density matrix
of the system. In each order, the ground state energy is found neglecting the
higher-order correlations between the sites, as long as the set of equations
remains non-singular. The conditions of the appearance of a singularity,
equivalent to the disappearance of energy gap in the given approximation, can
be directly obtained from the equations. Then the next order in the expansion
must be used, at the price of an $N$-fold increase in computational resources.
This ""martingale"" strategy allows reducing the computational costs to a power
of $N$ rather than $2^N$, with a finite probability of success. The strategy is
illustrated by the case of a two-spin system and extended to a large number of
qubits. Comparing the predictions to the experimental results obtained by using
an adiabatic quantum computer would help quantify the importance of multi-site
correlations, and the influence of decoherence, on its operation.

distribution of the agents. In the latter an inverse problem is solved in order
to reconstruct a nominal distribution and to recover the macro-scale properties

multi-agent systems, e.g., leader-follower systems. We derive error bounds for
the moment trajectories and describe how to take these error bounds into
account for computing the moment dynamics. The convergence of the moment
dynamics is also analyzed for cases with monomial moments. To illustrate the
theory, two numerical examples are given. In the first we consider a

several types of moments. In the second example we apply the framework to a

of the J-PLUS early data release (EDR) into compact (stars) or extended
(galaxies) using a suited Bayesian classifier. J-PLUS sources exhibit two
distinct populations in the r-band magnitude vs. concentration plane,
corresponding to compact and extended sources. We modelled the two-population
distribution with a skewed Gaussian for compact objects and a log-normal
function for the extended ones. The derived model and the number density prior
based on J-PLUS EDR data were used to estimate the Bayesian probability of a
source to be star or galaxy. This procedure was applied pointing-by-pointing to
account for varying observing conditions and sky position. Finally, we combined
the morphological information from g, r, and i broad bands in order to improve
the classification of low signal-to-noise sources. The derived probabilities
are used to compute the pointing-by-pointing number counts of stars and
galaxies. The former increases as we approach to the Milky Way disk, and the
latter are similar across the probed area. The comparison with SDSS in the
common regions is satisfactory up to r ~ 21, with consistent numbers of stars
and galaxies, and consistent distributions in concentration and (g - i) colour
spaces. We implement a morphological star/galaxy classifier based on PDF
analysis, providing meaningful probabilities for J-PLUS sources to one
magnitude deeper (r ~ 21) than a classical boolean classification. These
probabilities are suited for the statistical study of 150k stars and 101k
galaxies with 15 < r < 21 present in the 31.7 deg2 of the J-PLUS EDR. In a
future version of the classifier, we will include J-PLUS colour information

maximum of $f_A+f_B$ with respect to $G$, i.e., a vertex $v$ for which
$(f_A+f_B)(v)\geq (f_A+f_B)(u)$ for every neighbor $u$ of $v$.
  Our main result is that finding a local maximum requires polynomial (in the
number of vertices) bits of communication. The result holds for the following
families of graphs: three dimensional grids, hypercubes, odd graphs, and degree
4 graphs. Moreover, we provide an \emph{optimal} communication bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ for the hypercube, and for a constant dimensional greed,
where $N$ is the number of vertices in the graph.
  We provide applications of our main result in two domains, exact potential

equilibrium in $2$-player $N$-action exact potential games requires polynomial
(in $N$) communication. We also show that finding a pure Nash equilibrium in
$n$-player $2$-action exact potential games requires exponential (in $n$)
communication.
  The second domain that we consider is combinatorial auctions, in which we
prove that finding a local maximum in combinatorial auctions requires
exponential (in the number of items) communication even when the valuations are
submodular.
  Each one of the results demonstrates an exponential separation between the

according to their texture. In this method, less information is extracted from
areas with the smooth texture, and more information is extracted from areas
with the rough texture. Also, the extracted information for each type of blocks
is embedded in another block with the same type. So, changes in the smooth
areas are invisible to Human Visual System. To increase the localization power
a two-sided circular block dependency is proposed, which is able to distinguish
partially destroyed blocks. Pairwise block dependency and circular block
dependency, which are common methods in the block-based tamper detection, are
not able to distinguish the partially destroyed blocks. Cubic interpolation is
used in order to decrease the blocking effects in the recovery phase. The
results of the proposed method for regions with different texture show that the

small system collisions by tracking the evolution history of quarks of
different flavors within a multi-phase transport model. The charm quark $v_{2}$
is studied as a function of the number of collisions the charm quark suffers
with other quarks and then compared to the $v_{2}$ of lighter quarks. We find
that the common escape mechanism is at work for both the charm and light quark
$v_{2}$. However, contrary to the naive expectation, the hydrodynamics-type
flow is found to contribute more to the final state charm $v_{2}$ than light
quark $v_{2}$. This could be explained by the smaller average deflection angle
the heavier charm quark undergoes in each collision, so that heavy quarks need
more scatterings to accumulate a significant $v_{2}$, while lighter quarks can
more easily change directions with scatterings with their $v_{2}$ coming more
from the escape mechanism. Our finding thus suggests that the charm $v_{2}$ is
a better probe for studying the hydrodynamic properties of the quark-gluon
plasma.

novel multi-task leaning architecture in an end-to-end manner to reduce the
mapping range from input to output and boost the performance. Concretely, a
decomposition net is built to split rain images into clean background and rain
layers. Different from previous architectures, our model consists of, besides a
component representing the desired clean image, an extra component for the rain
layer. During the training phase, we further employ a composition structure to
reproduce the input by the separated clean image and rain information for
improving the quality of decomposition. Experimental results on both synthetic
and real images are conducted to reveal the high-quality recovery by our
design, and show its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our design is also applicable to other layer decomposition tasks

significantly faster than the competitors, to process a testing image in VGA
resolution on a GTX 1080 GPU, making it attractive for practical use.

parameter in such systems which didn't get enough attention in PIR schemes. As
a consequence, we take into consideration a third parameter, the access
complexity of a PIR scheme, which characterizes the total amount of data to be

We use a general covering codes approach as the main tool for improving the
access complexity. With a given amount of storage overhead, the ultimate
objective is to characterize the tradeoff between the rate and access

dynamics in games. However, a critical limitation of this solution concept is
its inability to distinguish between different learning rules that lead to the
same steady-state behavior. We address this limitation for the first time and
develop a framework for the comparative analysis of stochastic learning
dynamics with different update rules but same steady-state behavior. We present
the framework in the context of two learning dynamics: Log-Linear Learning
(LLL) and Metropolis Learning (ML). Although both of these dynamics have the
same stochastically stable states, LLL and ML correspond to different
behavioral models for decision making. Moreover, we demonstrate through an
example setup of sensor coverage game that for each of these dynamics, the
paths to stochastically stable states exhibit distinctive behaviors. Therefore,
we propose multiple criteria to analyze and quantify the differences in the
short and medium run behavior of stochastic learning dynamics. We derive and
compare upper bounds on the expected hitting time to the set of Nash equilibria
for both LLL and ML. For the medium to long-run behavior, we identify a set of
tools from the theory of perturbed Markov chains that result in a hierarchical
decomposition of the state space into collections of states called cycles. We
compare LLL and ML based on the proposed criteria and develop invaluable
insights into the comparative behavior of the two dynamics.

to realise a heat source of sub-1 micrometer diameter. This was achieved due to
a limited generation of secondary electrons, which increase a lateral energy
deposition. A low thermal capacitance of the fabricated devices is useful for
the real time monitoring of small and fast temperature changes, e.g., due to
convection, and can be detected through an optical and mechanical barrier of
the nano-thin membrane. Temperature changes up to ~2x10^5 K/s can be measured
at 10 kHz rate. A simultaneous down-sizing of both, the heat detector and heat

too fast for the detection bandwidth or otherwise outside the detection
sensitivity. Moreover, most envisioned biophysical applications are at room
temperature, which further limits detection due to significant thermal noise.
Here, we theoretically demonstrate reliable transduction of forces into
electronic currents via locally suspended graphene nanoribbons subject to
ultra-low flexural deflection. The decay of electronic couplings with distance
magnifies the effect of the deflection, giving rise to measurable electronic
current changes even in aqueous solution. Due to thermal fluctuations, the
characteristic charge carrier transmission peak follows a generalized Voigt
profile, behavior which is reflected in the optimized sensor. The intrinsic
sensitivity is less than 7 fN/$\sqrt{\mathbf{Hz}}$, allowing for the detection
of ultra-weak and fast processes at room temperature. Graphene deflectometry

  Feature Maps","9 pages with 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the framework of convolutional neural networks that lie at the heart of
deep learning, downsampling is often performed with a max-pooling operation
that only retains the element with maximum activation, while completely
discarding the information contained in other elements in a pooling region. To
address this issue, a novel pooling scheme, Ordinal Pooling Network (OPN), is
introduced in this work. OPN rearranges all the elements of a pooling region in
a sequence and assigns different weights to these elements based upon their
orders in the sequence, where the weights are learned via the gradient-based
optimisation. The results of our small-scale experiments on image
classification task demonstrate that this scheme leads to a consistent
improvement in the accuracy over max-pooling operation. This improvement is
expected to increase in deeper networks, where several layers of pooling become
necessary.

long ($\sim$130 ks) XMM-Newton observation and quasi-simultaneous NuSTAR and
Swift observations of the highly-accreting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk
1044. The broadband (0.3$-$50 keV) spectrum reveals the presence of a strong
soft X-ray excess emission below $\sim$1.5 keV, iron K$_{\alpha}$ emission
complex at $\sim$6$-$7 keV and a `Compton hump' at $\sim$15$-$30 keV. We find
that the relativistic reflection from a high-density accretion disc with a
broken power-law emissivity profile can simultaneously explain the soft X-ray
excess, highly ionized broad iron line and the Compton hump. At low frequencies
($[2-6]\times10^{-5}$ Hz), the power-law continuum dominated 1.5$-$5 keV band
lags behind the reflection dominated 0.3$-$1 keV band, which is explained with
a combination of propagation fluctuation and Comptonization processes, while at
higher frequencies ($[1-2]\times10^{-4}$ Hz), we detect a soft lag which is
interpreted as a signature of X-ray reverberation from the accretion disc. The
fractional root-mean-squared (rms) variability of the source decreases with
energy and is well described by two variable components: a less variable
relativistic disc reflection and a more variable direct coronal emission. Our
combined spectral-timing analyses suggest that the observed broadband X-ray
variability of Mrk~1044 is mainly driven by variations in the location or
geometry of the optically thin, hot corona.

analysts to extract business process models from event logs. Traditional
process discovery methods extract process models from a snapshot of an event
log stored in its entirety. In some scenarios, however, events keep coming with
a high arrival rate to the extent that it is impractical to store the entire
event log and to continuously re-discover a process model from scratch. Such
scenarios require online process discovery approaches. Given an event stream
produced by the execution of a business process, the goal of an online process
discovery method is to maintain a continuously updated model of the process
with a bounded amount of memory while at the same time achieving similar
accuracy as offline methods. However, existing online discovery approaches
require relatively large amounts of memory to achieve levels of accuracy
comparable to that of offline methods. Therefore, this paper proposes an
approach that addresses this limitation by mapping the problem of online
process discovery to that of cache memory management, and applying well-known
cache replacement policies to the problem of online process discovery. The
approach has been implemented in .NET, experimentally integrated with the Minit
process mining tool and comparatively evaluated against an existing baseline
using real-life datasets.

because short post-glitch dynamics are directly linked to strong frictional
processes on small scales. To illustrate this connection between macroscopic
observables and microphysics, we review calculations of vortex interactions
focusing on Kelvin wave excitations and determine the corresponding mutual
friction strength for realistic microscopic parameters in the inner crust.
These density-dependent crustal coupling profiles are combined with a
simplified treatment of the core coupling and implemented in a three-component
neutron star model to construct a predictive framework for glitch rises. As a
result of the density-dependent dynamics, we find the superfluid to transfer
angular momentum to different parts of the crust and the core on different
timescales. This can cause the spin frequency change to become non-monotonic in
time, allowing for a maximum value much larger than the measured glitch size,
as well as a delay in the recovery. The exact shape of the calculated glitch
rise is strongly dependent on the relative strength between the crust and core
mutual friction, providing the means to probe not only the crustal superfluid
but also the deeper neutron star interior. To demonstrate the potential of this
approach, we compare our predictive model with the first pulse-to-pulse
observations recorded during the December 2016 glitch of the Vela pulsar. Our
analysis suggests that the glitch rise behavior is relatively insensitive to
the crustal mutual friction strength as long as $\mathcal{B} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$,
while being strongly dependent on the core coupling strength, which we find to
be in the range $3 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \mathcal{B}_{\rm core} \lesssim
10^{-4}$.

minimizing a root-mean-square deviation or RMSD corresponding to a Euclidean
distance measure relating the two sets of matched coordinates. We focus on
quaternion eigensystem methods that have been exploited to solve this problem
for at least five decades in several different bodies of scientific literature
where they were discovered independently. While numerical methods for the
eigenvalue solutions dominate much of this literature, it has long been
realized that the quaternion-based RMSD optimization problem can also be solved
using exact algebraic expressions based on the form of the quartic equation
solution published by Cardano in 1545; we focus on these exact solutions to
expose the structure of the entire eigensystem for the traditional 3D spatial
alignment problem. We then explore the structure of the less-studied
orientation data context, investigating how quaternion methods can be extended
to solve the corresponding 3D quaternion orientation frame alignment (QFA)
problem, noting the interesting equivalence of this problem to the
rotation-averaging problem, which also has been the subject of independent
literature threads. We conclude with a brief discussion of the combined 3D
translation-orientation data alignment problem. Appendices are devoted to a
