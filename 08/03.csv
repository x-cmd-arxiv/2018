imagery. The approach is based on pixel level study employing various features
such as correlation, homogeneity, energy and contrast. In this study gray-scale
images are used for training the classification model. For supervised
classification, two classification techniques are employed namely the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and the Naive Bayes. With textural features used for
gray-scale images, Naive Bayes performs better with an overall accuracy of 76%
compared to 68% achieved by SVM. The computational time is evaluated while
performing the experiment with two different window sizes i.e., 50x50 and
70x70. The required computational time on a single image is found to be 27
seconds for a window size of 70x70 and 45 seconds for a window size of 50x50.

our construction does not rely on the presence of a central simple algebra

develop an approach that brings together a kinetic Monte Carlo model of
chemical aging with a contact mechanics model of rough surfaces based on the
boundary element method to determine the magnitude of chemical aging in
silica/silica contacts with random roughness. Our multi-scale model predicts
that chemical aging for randomly rough contacts has a logarithmic dependence on

dependence on the applied load as the load increase. We discover that surface
roughness affects the aging behavior primarily by modifying the real contact
area and the local contact pressure, whereas the effect of contact morphology
is relatively small. Our results demonstrate how understanding of chemical
aging can be translated from studies of single asperity contacts to macroscopic

calculation of the $I^G(J^{PC})=1^+(1^{+-})$ sector including $D^{(\ast)}\bar
D^{\ast}+h.c.$, $\pi J/\psi$ and $\rho\eta_c$ channels in the framework of a
constituent quark model which satisfactorily describes a wide range of
properties of (non-)conventional hadrons containing heavy quarks. The
meson-meson interactions are dominated by the non-diagonal $\pi
J/\psi-D^\ast\bar D^{(\ast)}$ and $\rho\eta_c-D^\ast\bar D^{(\ast)}$ couplings
which indicates that the $Z_{c}(3900)^\pm/Z_c(3885)^\pm$ and $Z_{c}(4020)^\pm$
are unusual structures. The study of the analytic structure of the $S$-matrix
allows us to conclude that the point-wise behavior of the line shapes in the

that results in a linear concentration profile of, for example, oxidant species
in the oxide layer. By relaxing this assumption and resolving the entire
problem, three regimes can be clearly identified corresponding to different
stages of oxidation. Namely, the oxidation starts with the reaction-controlled
regime (described by a linear rate law), is followed by a transitional regime
(described by a logarithmic or power law depending on the stoichiometry
coefficient m), and ends with the well known diffusion-controlled regime
(described by a parabolic rate law). Deal-Grove's theory is shown to be the
lower order approximation of the proposed model. Various oxidation rate laws
are unified into a single model to describe the entire oxidation process.

visual object detection technology, but are considerably expensive for large

accelerometer measurements from train car to estimate approximate passenger

parameters as hyperparameters of a modified ""physics informed"" Gaussian Process
kernel. This kernel includes the parametrized differential operators applied to
a prior covariance kernel. We extend this framework to linear space-fractional
differential equations. The methodology is compatible with a wide variety of
fractional operators in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and stationary covariance kernels,
including the Matern class, and can optimize the Matern parameter during
training. We provide a user-friendly and feasible way to perform fractional
derivatives of kernels, via a unified set of d-dimensional Fourier integral
formulas amenable to generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.
  The implementation of fractional derivatives has several benefits. First, it
allows for discovering fractional-order PDEs for systems characterized by heavy
tails or anomalous diffusion, bypassing the analytical difficulty of fractional
calculus. Data sets exhibiting such features are of increasing prevalence in
physical and financial domains. Second, a single fractional-order archetype
allows for a derivative of arbitrary order to be learned, with the order itself
being a parameter in the regression. This is advantageous even when used for
discovering integer-order equations; the user is not required to assume a
""dictionary"" of derivatives of various orders, and directly controls the
parsimony of the models being discovered. We illustrate on several examples,
including fractional-order interpolation of advection-diffusion and modeling
relative stock performance in the S&P 500 with alpha-stable motion via a

been developed and utilized to infer the underlying decision making problem.
The majority of existing studies assumes that the decision making problem is
with a single objective function, and attributes data divergence to noises,
errors or bounded rationality, which, however, could lead to a corrupted
inference when decisions are tradeoffs among multiple criteria. In this paper,
we take a data-driven approach and design a more sophisticated inverse
optimization formulation to explicitly infer parameters of a multiobjective
decision making problem from noisy observations. This framework, together with
our mathematical analyses and advanced algorithm developments, demonstrates a
strong capacity in estimating critical parameters, decoupling ""interpretable""
components from noises or errors, deriving the denoised \emph{optimal}
decisions, and ensuring statistical significance. In particular, for the whole
decision maker population, if suitable conditions hold, we will be able to
understand the overall diversity and the distribution of their preferences over
multiple criteria, which is important when a precise inference on every single
decision maker is practically unnecessary or infeasible. Numerical results on a
large number of experiments are reported to confirm the effectiveness of our
unique inverse optimization model and the computational efficacy of the
developed algorithms.

representation. In terms of a new $SO(3)$ ($\sim SU(2)$) vector constructed out

to the classical dynamics of a vector precessing with the angular velocity. In
our group theoretic approach, the equation of motion takes a universal form for
any system, and choosing a different type of interaction or a different basis
amounts to selecting the corresponding angular velocity. The expression of the
particle number density is greatly simplified, compared to the traditional

fermion production dynamics. For the purpose of the demonstration, we focus on
the fermion production through the derivative coupling to the pseudo-scalar.

provides one of the most compelling explanations for the observed smallness of
neutrino masses. The triplet contains a doubly-charged component
$H_L^{\pm\pm}$, which dominantly decays to either same-sign dileptons or to a
pair of $W$ bosons, depending on the size of the triplet vacuum expectation
value. However, there exists a range of Yukawa couplings $f_L$ of the triplet
to the charged leptons, wherein a relatively light $H_L^{\pm\pm}$ tends to be
long-lived, giving rise to distinct displaced-vertex signatures at the
high-energy colliders. We find that the displaced vertex signals from the
leptonic decays $H_L^{\pm\pm} \to \ell_\alpha^\pm \ell_\beta^\pm$ could probe a
broad parameter space with $10^{-10} \lesssim |f_L| \lesssim 10^{-6}$ and 45.6
GeV $< M_{H_L^{\pm\pm}} \lesssim 200$ GeV at the high-luminosity LHC. Similar
sensitivity can also be achieved at a future 1 TeV $e^+e^-$ collider. The mass
reach can be extended to about 500 GeV at a future 100 TeV proton-proton
collider. Similar conclusions apply for the right-handed triplet $H_R^{\pm\pm}$
in the TeV-scale left-right symmetric models, which provide a natural embedding
of the type-II seesaw. We show that the displaced vertex signals are largely
complementary to the prompt same-sign dilepton pair searches at the LHC and the
low-energy, high-intensity/precision measurements, such as neutrinoless double
beta decay, charged lepton flavor violation, electron and muon anomalous
magnetic moments, muonium oscillation and M{\o}ller scattering.

achieve diversity, we propose to embed images onto two spaces: a
domain-invariant content space capturing shared information across domains and
a domain-specific attribute space. Our model takes the encoded content features
extracted from a given input and the attribute vectors sampled from the
attribute space to produce diverse outputs at test time. To handle unpaired

disentangled representations. Qualitative results show that our model can
generate diverse and realistic images on a wide range of tasks without paired

and diversity with a perceptual distance metric. We apply the proposed model to
domain adaptation and show competitive performance when compared to the

study both single hadron fragmentation functions (FF) and dihadron
fragmentation functions (DiFF). In particular, the polarized DiFFs can be
accessed in electron-positron annihilation by measuring azimuthal correlations
between two back-to-back pairs of hadrons in the center of mass system, where
the relevant structure functions can be expressed as convolutions of two
(polarized) DiFFs. Here we explore the advantages of measuring the inclusive
back-to-back production of a single hadron on one side against a hadron pair on
the opposite side of the detector in two jet events. The leading twist cross
section for this process contains convolutions of the corresponding single
hadron FFs on one side and the DiFFs for the hadron pair on the other side,
which furnishes several interesting new opportunities. A measurement of the
unpolarized cross section with a number of different types of observed hadrons
will help in untangling the quark flavor dependence of the unpolarized DiFFs,
when the results are analyzed together with the inclusive measurements of
dihadron pairs, such as those recently performed by the $\texttt{BELLE}$
collaboration. Even more interesting, with a polarized hyperon on one side we
can study the quark spin-dependent DiFFs of an unpolarized hadron pair on the
other side. This, in turn, will allow us to test the universality of the
spin-dependent DiFFs entering the cross sections of electron-positron
annihilation and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes.

variety of astrophysical sources of non-thermal high-energy radiation. With
large-scale two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic
reconnection (i.e., with magnetization $\sigma\gg1$) in pair plasmas, we study
the long-term evolution of the power-law slope and high-energy cutoff of the
spectrum of accelerated particles. We find that the high-energy spectral cutoff
does not saturate at $\gamma_{\rm cut}\sim 4\sigma$, as claimed by earlier
studies, but it steadily grows with time as long as the reconnection process
stays active. At late times, the cutoff scales approximately as $\gamma_{\rm
cut}\propto \sqrt{t}$, regardless of the flow magnetization and initial
temperature. We show that the particles dominating the high-energy spectral
cutoff reside in plasmoids, and in particular in a strongly magnetised ring
around the plasmoid core. The growth of their energy is driven by the increase
in the local field strength, coupled with the conservation of the first
adiabatic invariant. We also find that the power-law slope of the spectrum
($p=-{\rm d}\log N/{\rm d}\log \gamma$) evolves with time. For
$\sigma\gtrsim10$, the spectrum is hard at early times ($p\lesssim 2$), but it
tends to asymptote to $p\sim 2$; the steepening of the power-law slope allows
the spectral cutoff to extend to higher and higher energies, without violating
the fixed energy budget of the system. Our results demonstrate that
relativistic reconnection is a viable candidate for accelerating the
high-energy particles emitting in relativistic astrophysical sources.

nuclei (AGN) variability and physical properties of the central supermassive
black hole (SMBH). We constructed optical light curves using data from the
QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey. To model the variability, we used the
structure function, among the excess variance and the amplitude from Damp
Random Walk (DRW) modeling. For the measurement of SMBH physical properties, we
used public spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis is
based on an original sample of 2345 sources detected in both SDSS and QUEST-La
Silla. For 1473 of these sources we could perform a proper measurement of the
spectral and variability properties, and 1348 of these sources were classified
as variable ($91.5\%$). We found that the amplitude of the variability ($A$)
depends solely on the rest frame emission wavelength and the Eddington ratio,
where $A$ anti-correlates with both $\lambda_{rest}$ and $L/L_{\text{Edd}}$.
This suggests that AGN variability does not evolve over cosmic time, and its
amplitude is inversely related to the accretion rate. We found that the
logarithmic gradient of the variability ($\gamma$) does not correlate
significantly with any SMBH physical parameter, since there is no statistically
significant linear regression model with an absolute value of the slope higher
than 0.1. Finally, we found that the general distribution of $\gamma$ measured
for our sample differs from the distribution of $\gamma$ obtained for light
curves simulated from a DRW process. For 20.6\% of the variable sources in our
sample, a DRW model is not appropriate to describe the variability, since
$\gamma$ differs considerably from the expected value of 0.5.

APOGEE-DR14 element abundances and $\textit{Gaia}$-DR2 kinematics of halo
stars. We show that $\sim$2/3 of nearby halo stars have high orbital
eccentricities ($e \gtrsim 0.8$), and abundance patterns typical of massive
Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites today, characterised by relatively low
[Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The trend followed by high $e$ stars in
the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane shows a change of slope at [Fe/H]$\sim-1.3$, which is
also typical of stellar populations from relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low
$e$ stars exhibit no such change of slope within the observed [Fe/H] range and
show slightly higher abundances of Mg, Al and Ni. Unlike their low $e$
counterparts, high $e$ stars show slightly retrograde motion, make higher
vertical excursions and reach larger apocentre radii. By comparing the position
in [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] space of high $e$ stars with those of accreted galaxies from
the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations we constrain the mass of the
accreted satellite to be in the range $10^{8.5}\lesssim M_*\lesssim
10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We show that the median orbital eccentricities of
debris are largely unchanged since merger time, implying that this accretion
event likely happened at $z\lesssim1.5$. The exact nature of the low $e$
population is unclear, but we hypothesise that it is a combination of
$\textit{in situ}$ star formation, high $|z|$ disc stars, lower mass accretion
events, and contamination by the low $e$ tail of the high $e$ population.
Finally, our results imply that the accretion history of the Milky Way was
quite unusual.

(t_rise < 5d), luminous (M_peak < -18), blue transients. While commonly
attributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great
distances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed
investigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from
a comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the first
fast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Our
first spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad
absorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between
3-8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after
>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the
photospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1
month). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a
relativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed
features. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of a
star by an intermediate-mass black hole, although this would require
long-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In either
case, AT2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients
represents a new class of astrophysical event. Intensive follow-up of this
event in its late phases, and of any future events found at comparable
distance, will be essential to better constrain their origins.

$10^{40}-10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a regime in which X-ray binaries (XRBs) can
dominate the X-ray emission. Comparing the measured luminosities to established
XRB scaling relations, we find that the redshift evolution of the luminosity
per star formation rate (SFR) of XRBs depends sensitively on the assumed
obscuration and may be weaker than previously found. The XRB scaling relation
based on stacks from the Chandra Deep Field South overestimates the XRB
contribution to the COSMOS high specific SFR (sSFR) stacks, possibly due to a
bias affecting the CDF-S stacks because of their small galaxy samples. After
subtracting the estimated XRB contribution from the stacks, we find that most
stacks at $z>1.3$ exhibit a significant X-ray excess indicating nuclear
emission. The AGN emission is strongly correlated with stellar mass but does
not exhibit an additional correlation with SFR. The hardness ratios of the
high-redshift stacks indicate that the AGN are substantially obscured
($N_{\mathrm{H}}\sim10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). These obscured AGN are not identified
by IRAC color selection and have $L_X\sim10^{41}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
consistent with accretion at an Eddington rate of $\sim10^{-3}$ onto $10^7-10^8

that AGN obscuration depends on stellar mass and an additional variable,
possibly the Eddington rate.

process: it is often the case that far fewer baryons are observed in galaxy
disks than expected from the cosmic baryon fraction. The location of these
""missing baryons"" is unclear. By fitting halo profiles to the rotation curves
of galaxies in the SPARC data set, we measure the ""missing baryon"" mass for
individual late-type systems. Assuming that haloes initially accrete the
cosmological baryon fraction, we show that the maximum energy available from
supernovae is typically not enough to completely eject these ""missing baryons""
from a halo, but it is often sufficient to heat them to the virial temperature.
The energy available from supernovae has the same scaling with galaxy mass as
the energy needed to heat or eject the ""missing baryons"", indicating that the
coupling efficiency of the feedback to the ISM may be constant with galaxy
virial mass. We further find that the energy available from supernova feedback
is always enough to convert a primordial cusp into a core and has magnitude
consistent with what is required to heat the ""missing baryons"" to the virial

not centred on the optical galaxy centre, but instead around a third of atomic
gas resides in the region close to the SN position. This galaxy has a few times
lower atomic and molecular gas masses than predicted from its SFR. SN 2009bb
exploded close to the region with the highest SFR density and the lowest age
(~5.5 Myr, corresponding to the initial mass of the progenitor star ~36 Mo). As
for GRB hosts, the gas properties of NGC 3278 are consistent with a recent
inflow of gas from the intergalactic medium, which explains the concentration
of atomic gas close to the SN position and the enhanced SFR. Super-solar
metallicity at the position of the SN (unlike for most GRBs) may mean that
relativistic explosions signal a recent inflow of gas (and subsequent star
formation), and their type (GRBs or SNe) is determined either i) by the
metallicity of the inflowing gas, so that metal-poor gas results in a GRB
explosion and metal-rich gas results in a relativistic SN explosion without an
accompanying GRB, or ii) by the efficiency of gas mixing, or iii) by the type

wings that reach -10,000km/s to the blue and +20,000km/s to the red. The line
profile shape is inconsistent with electron scattering wings, indicating
high-velocity outflowing material. These are the fastest outflow speeds ever
seen in a non-terminal massive star eruption. The broad wings are absent in
early phases of the eruption, but strengthen in the 1850s. These speeds are two
orders of magnitude faster than the escape speed from a warm supergiant, and
5-10 times faster than winds from O-type or Wolf-Rayet stars. Instead, they are
reminiscent of fast supernova ejecta or outflows from accreting compact
objects, profoundly impacting our understanding of eta Car and related
transients. This echo views eta Car from latitudes near the equator, so the
high speed does not trace a collimated polar jet aligned with the Homunculus.
Combined with fast material in the Outer Ejecta, it indicates a wide-angle
explosive outflow. The fast material may constitute a small fraction of the

plateau. Later phases also develop remarkably broad emission wings indicating
mass accelerated to more than 10,000 km/s. Together with other clues, this
provides direct evidence for an explosive ejection. This is accompanied by a
transition from narrow absorption lines to emission lines, often with broad P
Cygni profiles. These changes imply that the pre-1845 luminosity spikes are
distinct from the 1850s plateau. The key reason for this change may be that
shock interaction dominates the plateau. The spectral evolution of eta Car
closely resembles that of UGC2773-OT, which had clear signatures of shock
interaction. We propose a 2-stage scenario for eta Car's eruption: (1) a slow
outflow in the decades before the eruption, driven by binary interaction that
produced a dense equatorial outflow, followed by (2) explosive energy injection
that drove CSM interaction, powering the plateau and sweeping slower CSM into a
fast shell that became the Homunculus. We discuss how this sequence could arise
from a stellar merger in a triple system, leaving the eccentric binary seen

solids, the stress autocorrelation function presents anisotropic terms that
decay as $1/r^3$ at long-range, with $r$ the distance, as soon as either
pressure or shear stress fluctuations are normal. By normal, we mean that the
fluctuations of stress, as averaged over spherical domains, decay as the
inverse domain volume. Since this property is required for macroscopic stress
to be self-averaging, it is expected to hold generically in all glasses and we
thus conclude that the presence of $1/r^3$ stress correlation tails is the rule
in these systems. Our proof follows from the observation that, in an infinite
medium, when both material isotropy and mechanical balance hold, (i) the stress
autocorrelation matrix is completely fixed by just two radial functions: the
pressure autocorrelation and the trace of the autocorrelation of stress
deviators; furthermore, these two functions (ii) fix the decay of the
fluctuations of sphere-averaged pressure and deviatoric stresses for windows of
increasing volume. Our conclusion is reached because, due to the precise
analytic relation (i) fixed by isotropy and mechanical balance, the constraints
arising via (ii) from the normality of stress fluctuations demand the spatially
anisotropic stress correlation terms to decay as $1/r^3$ at long-range. For the
sake of generality, we also examine situations when stress fluctuations are not

identified loci harboring Pdh1, NST1A and SHAT1-5. Pairwise epistatic
interactions were observed, and the dehiscent Pdh1 overcomes the resistance
conferred by NST1A or SHAT1-5 locus, indicating that Pdh1 predominates pod
dehiscence expression. Further candidate gene association analysis identified a
nonsense mutation in NST1A associated with pod dehiscence. Allele composition
and population differential analyses unraveled that Pdh1 and NST1A, but not
SHAT1-5, underwent domestication and modern breeding selections. Geographic
analysis showed that in Northeast China (NEC), indehiscence at both Pdh1 and
NST1A were required by cultivated soybean; while indehiscent Pdh1 alone is
capable of coping shattering in Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) valleys where it
originated; and no specific indehiscence was required in Southern China (SC).
Geo-climatic investigation revealed strong correlation between relative
humidity and frequency of indehiscent Pdh1 across China. This study
demonstrates that the epistatic interaction between Pdh1 and NST1A fulfills a
pivotal role in determining the level of resistance against pod dehiscence.
Humidity shapes the distribution of indehiscent alleles. Our results also
suggest that HHH valleys, not NEC, was at least one of the origin centers of
cultivated soybean.

for all six simulations. The combination of these analyses produced a subset of
6 independent sensitive parameters that could be estimated given idealized
clinical data. All optimizations performed using pseudo-data with perturbed

within ~8% of nominal values on average. This analysis indicates the

The condensed states can represent compact objects such as white dwarfs,

parameters: the system size $R$ and the particle number $N$. When $N<N_{\rm
OV}$, where $N_{\rm OV}$ is the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, there exists an
equilibrium state for any value of the temperature $T$ and of the energy $E$ as
in the nonrelativistic case [P.H. Chavanis, Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 20, 3113

exclusion principle). When $N>N_{\rm OV}$, there is no equilibrium state below
a critical energy and below a critical temperature. In that case, the system is
expected to collapse towards a black hole. We plot the caloric curves of the
general relativistic Fermi gas, study the different types of phase transitions
that occur in the system, and determine the phase diagram in the $(R,N)$ plane.
The nonrelativistic results are recovered for $N\ll N_{\rm OV}$ and $R\gg

N_{\rm OV}$ and $R\gg R_{\rm OV}$ with $N/R$ fixed. We highlight a situation of
physical interest where a gaseous Fermi gas, by cooling, first undergoes a
phase transition towards a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star, dark
matter fermion ball), then collapses into a black hole. This situation occurs
in the microcanonical ensemble when $N_{\rm OV}<N<3.73\, N_{\rm OV}$. We also
relate the phase transitions from a gaseous state to a core-halo state in the

subsystem into a channel gain aggregation stage followed by a spreading stage.
Both stages use phase shifters. Our goal is to design the two-stage analog
combiner to optimize mutual information (MI) between the transmitted and
quantized signals by effectively managing quantization error. To this end, we
formulate an unconstrained MI maximization problem without a constant modulus
constraint on analog combiners, and derive a two-stage analog combining
solution. The solution achieves the optimal scaling law with respect to the
number of radio frequency chains and maximizes the MI for homogeneous singular
values of a MIMO channel. We further develop a two-stage analog combining
algorithm to implement the derived solution for mmWave channels. By decoupling
channel gain aggregation and spreading functions from the derived solution, the
proposed algorithm implements the two functions by using array response vectors
and a discrete Fourier transform matrix under the constant modulus constraint
on each matrix element. Therefore, the proposed algorithm provides a near
optimal solution for the unconstrained problem, whereas conventional hybrid
approaches offer a near optimal solution only for a constrained problem. The
closed-form approximation of the ergodic rate is derived for the algorithm,
showing that a practical digital combiner with two-stage analog combining also
achieves the optimal scaling law. Simulation results validate the algorithm
performance and the derived ergodic rate.

organize themselves into ordered phases of matter, whose nature and symmetries
are captured by an order parameter. In the simplest cases, this order parameter
is spatially uniform. For example, a system of localized spins with
ferromagnetic interactions align themselves to a common direction and build up
a macroscopic magnetization on large distances. However, non-uniform situations
also exist in nature, for instance in antiferromagnetism where the
magnetization alternates in space. The situation becomes even richer when the
spin-carrying particles are mobile, for instance in the so-called stripe phases
emerging for itinerant electrons in strongly-correlated materials.
Understanding such inhomogeneously ordered states is of central importance in
many-body physics. In this work, we study experimentally the magnetic ordering
of itinerant spin-1 bosons in inhomegeneous spin domains at nano-Kelvin
temperatures. We demonstrate that spin domains form spontaneously after a phase
separation transition, \textit{i.e.} in the absence of external magnetic force,
purely because of the antiferromagnetic interactions between the atoms.

shapes which represent a singularity of the governing equation. The cusp tip
often exhibits self-similarity as well, indicative of scaling symmetry
invariant in time up to a change of scale. Cusp formation can even occur in
liquid systems when the driving force for fluid elongation is sufficiently
strong to overcome leveling by capillarity. In almost all cases reported in the
literature, however, the moving interface is assumed to be \textit{shear-free}
and the operable forces orient exclusively in the direction normal to the
advancing boundary. Here we focus on a system in which a slender liquid film is
exposed to large thermocapillary stresses, a system previously shown to undergo
a linear instability resembling microlens arrays. We demonstrate by analytic
and numerical means how in the nonlinear regime these surface forces undergo
self-similar runaway behavior leading to cusp formation with a conical tip
whose slope can be prescribed from the analytic relation derived. On a
fundamental level, this finding broadens our understanding of known categories
of flows capable of cusp formation. More practically, the system geometry
proposed offers a potentially novel lithographic method for one-step
non-contact fabrication of cuspidal microarrays.

framework of atomic norm minimization (ANM) is considered, which has been
successfully applied in 1-D problems to allow super-resolution frequency
estimation for correlated sources even when the number of snapshots is highly
limited. The state-of-the-art 2-D ANM approach vectorizes the 2-D measurements
to their 1-D equivalence, which incurs huge computational cost and may become
too costly for practical applications. We develop a novel decoupled approach of
2-D ANM via semi-definite programming (SDP), which introduces a new matrix-form
atom set to naturally decouple the joint observations in both dimensions
without loss of optimality. Accordingly, the original large-scale 2-D problem
is equivalently reformulated via two decoupled one-level Toeplitz matrices,
which can be solved by simple 1-D frequency estimation with pairing. Compared
with the conventional vectorized approach, the proposed D-ANM technique reduces
the computational complexity by several orders of magnitude with respect to the

large-scale antenna systems such as massive MIMO, radar signal processing and

proposed schemes in literature are convoluted and cannot be easily implemented

models the energy constraint problem of devices in IoT applications as an
optimization problem. To conserve the energy of device nodes, the routing
protocol first aggregates devices into clusters based on a number of different

sensed from the environment in the current epoch. Then, a cluster head is
elected for each cluster and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is generated with
all the cluster heads as nodes. Edges represent communication intent from
transmitter to receiver and the edge weights are computed using a formulated
equation. The minimum cost path to the base station is computed to allow for
efficient real-time routing. Sleep scheduling is also optionally used to
further boost network energy efficiency. The proposed routing protocol has been

connected to reservoirs/contacts maintained at different temperatures is
studied in this work. The left reservoir is also coupled to a periodic THz
driving source leading to a rearrangement of its internal energy levels. The
modified levels are determined using Floquet theory that governs the dynamics
of a periodic Hamiltonian. The starting point for the presented thermopower
calculations (mirrored in the related thermal gradient controlled current) is
the Landauer formula rooted in the transmission formalism. Primarily, we show
that while thermally activated electrons can be pumped from the hot reservoir
into the cold side as a straightforward manifestation of the Seebeck effect
through a difference in their respective Fermi levels, the quantum of charge
flow increases in presence of the periodic perturbation. We explain this
phenomenon by noting how the periodic driving makes available a greater number
of states in the left reservoir that are able to inject electrons into the
channel. The calculations also uncover a useful feature whereby the strength of
such a thermally-pumped current is amenable through a joint control of the
amplitude and frequency of the signal, offering an additional
experimentally-adjustable tool to regulate their flow. The calculated results
are shown for two classes of materials defined by prototypical linear and

Furthermore, the regularization strategies used to obtain meaningful results

using a multiscale transform based on superpixels. The proposed method results
in a fast algorithm that solves the abundance estimation problem only once in

polynomial chaos and separated representations, require basis functions
orthogonal with respect to the density of random inputs. Many modern
engineering problems employ stochastic circular quantities, which are defined
on the unit circle in the complex plane and characterized by probability
density functions on this periodic domain. Hence, stochastic expansions with
circular data require corresponding orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle
to allow for their use in uncertainty quantification. Rogers-Szego polynomials
enable uncertainty quantification for random inputs described by the wrapped
normal density. For the general case, this paper presents a framework for
numerically generating orthogonal polynomials as a function of the
distribution's characteristic function and demonstrates their use with the von
Mises density. The resulting stochastic expansions allow for estimating
statistics describing the posterior density using the expansion coefficients.
Results demonstrate the exponential convergence of these stochastic expansions
and apply the proposed methods to propagating orbit-state uncertainty with
equinoctial elements. The astrodynamics application of the theory improves
robustness and accuracy when compared to approximating angular quantities as

Structural hierarchy confers many mechanical advantages, including improved
toughness and economy of material. However, it also presents a problem: each
hierarchical level adds a new source of assembly errors, and substantially
increases the information required for proper assembly. This seems to conflict
with the prevalence of naturally occurring hierarchical structures, suggesting
that a common mechanical source of hierarchical robustness may exist. However,
our ability to identify such a unifying phenomenon is limited by the lack of a
general mechanical framework for structures exhibiting organization on
disparate length scales. Here, we use simulations to substantiate a generalized
model for the tensile stiffness of hierarchical, stretching-stabilized,
filamentous networks with a nested, dilute triangular lattice structure.
Following seminal work by Maxwell and others on criteria for stiff frames, we
extend the concept of connectivity in network mechanics, and find a
mathematically similar dependence of material stiffness upon each hierarchical
level. Using this model, we find that the stiffness of such networks becomes
less sensitive to errors in assembly with additional levels of hierarchy;
though surprising, we show that this result is analytically predictable from
first principles, and thus likely model-independent. More broadly, this work
helps account for the success of hierarchical, filamentous materials in biology
and materials design, and offers a heuristic for ensuring that desired material
properties are achieved within the required tolerance.

the generation of intense isolated attosecond pulses in the extreme
ultra-violet (XUV) and X-ray spectral range. However, its experimental
realization is still a challenging task requiring identification of the optimum
conditions for the generation of isolated attosecond pulses as well as their
temporal characterization. Here, we demonstrate measurements in both
directions. Particularly, we have made a first step towards the temporal
characterization of the emitted XUV radiation by adapting the attosecond streak
camera concept to identify the time domain characteristics of relativistic
surface high harmonics. The results, supported by PIC simulations, set the
upper limit for the averaged (over many shots) XUV duration to <6 fs, even when
driven by not CEP controlled relativistic few-cycle optical pulses. Moreover,
by measuring the dependence of the spectrum of the relativistic surface high
harmonics on the carrier envelope phase (CEP) of the driving infrared laser
field, we experimentally determined the optimum conditions for the generation
of intense isolated attosecond pulses.

been proposed to solve MOD. One of the challenges is to separate moving objects
from illumination changes and shadows that are present in most real world
videos. State-of-the-art methods that can handle illumination changes and

extension of a state-of-the-art batch MOD method (ILISD) to an
online/incremental MOD using unsupervised and generative neural networks, which
use illumination invariant image representations. For each image in a sequence,
we use a low-dimensional representation of a background image by a neural
network and then based on the illumination invariant representation, decompose
the foreground image into: illumination change and moving objects. Optimization
is performed by stochastic gradient descent in an end-to-end and unsupervised
fashion. Our algorithm can work in both batch and online modes. In the batch
mode, like other batch methods, optimizer uses all the images. In online mode,
images can be incrementally fed into the optimizer. Based on our experimental
evaluation on benchmark image sequences, both the online and the batch modes of

Firstly, a novel item embedding method based on user interactions is developed
for obtaining an unified representation for each item. Then, with the embedded
items and the interactive behaviors over item sequences, BINN discriminatively
learns the historical preferences and present motivations of the target users.
Thus, BINN could better perform recommendations of the next items for the
target users. Finally, for evaluating the performances of BINN, we conduct
extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, i.e., Tianchi and JD. The

realms (e.g., social media) has revealed surprising antisocial tendencies in
human-agent interactions. In particular, there is growing indication of
people's propensity to act aggressively towards such systems - without
provocation and unabashedly so.
  Towards understanding whether this aggressive behavior is anomalous or
whether it is associated with general antisocial tendencies in people's broader
interactions, we examined people's verbal disinhibition towards two artificial
agents. Using Twitter as a corpus of free-form, unsupervised interactions, we
identified 40 independent Twitter users who tweeted abusively or non-abusively
at one of two high-profile robots with Twitter accounts (TMI's Bina48 and
Hanson Robotics' Sophia). Analysis of 50 of each user's tweets most proximate
to their tweet at the respective robot (N=2,000) shows people's aggression
towards the robots to be associated with more frequent abuse in their general
tweeting. The findings thus suggest that disinhibition towards robots is not
necessarily a pervasive tendency, but rather one driven by individual
differences in antisociality. Nevertheless, such unprovoked abuse highlights a
need for attention to the reception of agentic technologies in society, as well
as the necessity of corresponding capacities to recognize and respond to
antisocial dynamics.

by highly conductive edges serve as barriers to contain the displacement of
flow due to a localized perturbation. In this way, the vein provides shielding
from damage to surrounding edges. We show that once the conductivity of the
vein surpasses an initial minimal value, further increasing the conductivity
can no longer extend the shielding provided by the vein. Rather, the length
scale of the shielding is set by the network topology. Upon understanding the
effects of a single vein, we investigate the global resilience of networks with

studying the total length of a minimal spanning tree on a random sampling of

Experiments suggest that similar results may be true for higher-dimensional

defined by considering a limit, as the number of points $n$ goes to infinity,
of the total sum of the $i$-dimensional persistent homology interval lengths
for $n$ random points selected from $\mu$ in an i.i.d. fashion. To some
measures $\mu,$ we are able to assign a finer invariant, a curve measuring the
limiting distribution of persistent homology interval lengths as the number of

$0$-dimensional homology when $\mu$ is the uniform distribution over the unit
interval, and conjecture that it exists when $\mu$ is the rescaled probability

the network split probability as a function of the network size, the packet
loss rate, and the election timeout period. To validate our analysis, we
implement a Raft simulator and the simulation results coincide with the

time and probability in theory and optimize the parameters in Raft consensus

The hadronic matter and quark matter equation of states are used to calculate
the matter velocities on either side of the shock front. The CA with the

values. The maximum of the quark pressure is reflected in the retracing of the

slow deflagration in most of the low and intermediate density range. The result
is crucial and emphasizes on the fact that PT in NSs does not always starts

quasi-one-dimensional band dispersions and the isotropic (two-dimensional for

key factors for the thermoelectric performance are the anisotropy of the former
band dispersion and the degeneracy of these two kinds of band dispersions. We
also find that a large extension of the chalcogen orbitals often improves their
thermoelectric performance by improving these two factors or by going beyond
such a basic band structure through a large alternation of its shape. Such a
large extension of the chalcogen orbitals might partially originate from the

beamforming which involves only phased sums of the correlation of the voltages

incoherent and phased beamforming techniques. Using data from the GMRT we show
that post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the
signal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of
magnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events
like fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the
post-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency
interference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than
the incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of
post-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam
from the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The
computational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their
suitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed. Techniques discussed
here would be of interest for all upcoming surveys with interferometric arrays.
Finally, we describe a time-domain survey with the GMRT using the
post-correlation beamformation as a case study. We find that post-correlation
beamforming will improve the current GMRT time-domain survey sensitivity by ~ 2
times for pulsars with periods of few 100s of millisecond and by many-folds for
even slower pulsars, making it one of the most sensitive surveys for pulsars

explained by the conventional law of spherical shock wave propagation; on the

acceleration mechanism in the shock front beyond thermal collision. We consider
herein the detonation wave description of the SNR expansion, in which magnetic
reconnection follows the shock front and transfers the SNR magnetic field
energy to both fluid thermal energy and particle kinetic energy. The structure
of the magnetic reconnection detonation (MRD) is identified based on scaling

ensures both of these goals by obtaining state-of-the-art performance for an
image-to-video search scenario. Hence, we present critical enhancements to
well-known indexing and visual representation techniques by promoting faster,
better and moderate retrieval performance. We also boost the superiority of our
method for some visual challenges by exploiting individual decisions of local
and global descriptors at query time. For instance, local content descriptors
represent copied/duplicated scenes with large geometric deformations such as
scale, orientation and affine transformation. In contrast, the use of global
content descriptors is more practical for near-duplicate and semantic searches.
Experiments are conducted on a large-scale Stanford I2V dataset. The
experimental results show that our method is useful in terms of complexity and
query processing time for large-scale visual retrieval scenarios, even if local
and global representations are used together. The proposed method is superior
and achieves state-of-the-art performance based on the mean average precision
(MAP) score of this dataset. Lastly, we report additional MAP scores after
updating the ground annotations unveiled by retrieval results of the proposed
method, and it shows that the actual performance.

multiple sources by hallucinating a deep visual domain composed of images,

by two adversarial domain classifier branches at image and feature level. Our
approach is conceived to learn only from source data, but it seamlessly extends
to the use of unlabeled target samples. Remarkable results for both
multi-source domain adaptation and domain generalization support the power of

since different layers in a deep network capture feature maps of different

utilize multi-scale information to obtain more accurate attention scores, which

unrestricted to the number of its input feature maps so it is easily extended

hydrogen distribution is computed in full cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
including star formation and supernova feedback under a uniform ultra-violet
background radiation. We find a significant scale dependence of HI bias at z>3
on scales of k>1h/Mpc, but it is roughly constant at lower redshift z<3. The
redshift evolution of HI bias is relatively slow compared to that of QSOs at
similar redshift range. We also measure a redshift space distortion (RSD) of HI
gas to explore the properties of HI clustering. Fitting to a widely applied
theoretical prediction, we find that the constant bias is consistent with that
measured directly from the real-space power spectra, and the velocity
dispersion is marginally consistent with the linear perturbation prediction.
Finally we compare the results obtained from our simulation and the Illustris

receives more attention since it is closer to real-world application. A key
point of a good algorithm for multi-shot person re-id is the temporal
aggregation of the person appearance features. While most of the current
approaches apply pooling strategies and obtain a fixed-size vector
representation, these may lose the matching evidence between examples. In this
work, we propose the idea of visual distributional representation, which
interprets an image set as samples drawn from an unknown distribution in
appearance feature space. Based on the supervision signals from a downstream
task of interest, the method reshapes the appearance feature space and further
learns the unknown distribution of each image set. In the context of multi-shot
person re-id, we apply this novel concept along with Wasserstein distance and
learn a distributional set distance function between two image sets. In this
way, the proper alignment between two image sets can be discovered naturally in
a non-parametric manner. Our experiment results on two public datasets show the
advantages of our proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art

characterised by higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum (three-point

of the bispectrum will not only improve the cosmological constraints, but also
give us the possibility to probe gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper,
we present a framework to numerically calculate the one-loop matter bispectrum
based on standard perturbation theory (SPT). This approach allows general
modifications to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to be easily implemented. We
demonstrate the performance of the bispectrum calculation in three
representative cases, namely the Vainshtein-screened Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
(DGP) model, the chameleon-screened Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model and the
phenomenological dark scattering (DS) momentum-exchange model. The predicted
bispectra are then compared with measured results from a set of cosmological
$N$-body simulations, and the impact of possible systematics arising from
simplified or approximate treatments in the perturbative calculation is studied
in detail. We find that the one-loop bispectrum calculation offers
significantly more information on general screening and momentum exchange
effects than the leading-order bispectrum calculation. Further, the accuracy of
the one-loop prediction is shown to be comparable to non-linear fitting

code representation. We propose a novel and efficient stochastic regression
approach with latent drop-out codes that combines the merits of both lines of
research. In addition, a new training objective increases coverage of the
training distribution leading to improvements over the state of the art in
terms of accuracy as well as diversity.

gap between 700 and 800 K. The calculated band gap is highly sensitive to small
out-of-plane Sn displacements observed in the diffraction experiments. SnSe

from scarcity of real images with 3D keypoint and pose annotations. Drawing
inspiration from human cognition, where the annotators use a 3D CAD model as
structural reference to acquire ground-truth viewpoints for real images; we
propose an iterative Semantic Pose Alignment Network, called iSPA-Net. Our
approach focuses on exploiting semantic 3D structural regularity to solve the
task of fine-grained pose estimation by predicting viewpoint difference between
a given pair of images. Such image comparison based approach also alleviates
the problem of data scarcity and hence enhances scalability of the proposed
approach for novel object categories with minimal annotation. The fine-grained
object pose estimator is also aided by correspondence of learned spatial
descriptor of the input image pair. The proposed pose alignment framework
enjoys the faculty to refine its initial pose estimation in consecutive
iterations by utilizing an online rendering setup along with effectiveness of a
non-uniform bin classification of pose-difference. This enables iSPA-Net to
achieve state-of-the-art performance on various real image viewpoint estimation
datasets. Further, we demonstrate effectiveness of the approach for multiple
applications. First, we show results for active object viewpoint localization
to capture images from similar pose considering only a single image as pose
reference. Second, we demonstrate the ability of the learned semantic
correspondence to perform unsupervised part-segmentation transfer using only a
single part-annotated 3D template model per object class. To encourage
reproducible research, we have released the codes for our proposed algorithm.

benchmark for hillclimbing algorithms on pseudo-Boolean functions $f: \{0,1\}^n

of hillclimbers fail to be efficient. For example, the $(1+1)$-Evolutionary
Algorithm is a standard hillclimber which flips each bit independently with
probability $c/n$ in each round. Perhaps surprisingly, this algorithm shows a
phase transition: it optimizes any monotone pseudo-boolean function in
quasilinear time if $c<1$, but there are monotone functions for which the
algorithm needs exponential time if $c>2.2$. But so far it was unclear whether
the threshold is at $c=1$.
  In this paper we show how Moser's entropy compression argument can be adapted

encode the random steps of the algorithm with less bits than their entropy.
Thus there exists a $c_0 > 1$ such that for all $0<c\le c_0$ the

enhancement in its stability, associated with the improved signal-to-noise
ratio of a large atom number $N$. An interesting question, however, is what
type of atomic interactions might affect the clock dynamics, and whether these
interactions are deleterious or could even be beneficial. In this work, we
investigate the effect of dipole-dipole interactions, in which atoms excited
during the clock protocol emit and re-absorb photons. Taking a simple system
consisting of a 1D atomic array, we find that dipole-dipole interactions in
fact result in an open quantum system exhibiting critical dynamics, as a set of
collective excitations acquires a decay rate approaching zero in the
thermodynamic limit due to subradiance. A first consequence is that the decay
of atomic excited population at long times exhibits a slow power-law behavior,
instead of the exponential expected for non-interacting atoms. We also find
that excitations among the atoms exhibit fermionic spatial correlations at long
times, due to the microscopic properties of the multi-excitation subradiant
states. Interestingly, these properties cannot be captured by mean-field
dynamics, suggesting the strongly interacting nature of this system. We finally
characterize the time-dependent frequency shift in the atomic frequency
measurement, and find that it is dominated by the interaction energy of
subradiant states at long times. Furthermore, we show that the decay of the
clock signal displays at long times a non-exponential behavior, which might be
useful to improve the uncertainty limit with which the atomic frequency can be
resolved.

$\tau_{\rm{s}} = 10^{-1} - 10^0$, one where $\tau_{\rm{s}} = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$
and finally one where $\tau_{\rm{s}} = 10^{-3} - 10^{0}$. Moreover, we consider
both discrete and continuous distributions in particle size. In accordance with
previous works we find in our multi-species simulations that different particle
sizes interact via the gas and as a result their dynamics changes compared to
the single-species case. The larger species trigger the streaming instability
and create turbulence that drives the diffusion of the solid materials. We
measure the radial equilibrium velocity of the system and find that the radial
drift velocity of the large particles is reduced in the multi-species
simulations and that the small particle species move on average outwards. We
also vary the steepness of the size distribution, such that the exponent of the
solid number density distribution, $\rm{d}\it{N}/\rm{d}\it{a} \propto
\it{a^{-q}}$, is either $q = 3$ or $q = 4$. We measure the scale height of the
particles and observe that small grains are stirred up well above the
sedimented midplane layer where the large particles reside. Our measured
diffusion and drift parameters can be used in coagulation models for planet
formation as well as to understand relative mixing of the components of
primitive meteorites (matrix, chondrules and CAIs) prior to inclusion in their
parent bodies.

We have observed that having fixed parameters lead to unnecessary computations,

adaptation method for Hoeffding trees. This method adapts the value of the nmin
parameter, which significantly affects the energy consumption of the algorithm.
The method reduces unnecessary computations and memory accesses, thus reducing
the energy, while the accuracy is only marginally affected. We experimentally
compared VFDT (Very Fast Decision Tree, the first Hoeffding tree algorithm) and
CVFDT (Concept-adapting VFDT) with the VFDT-nmin (VFDT with nmin adaptation).
The results show that VFDT-nmin consumes up to 27% less energy than the

and copy each important file into other data centers such that this file can
increase its lifetime of staying in a data center network. In this paper, we
describe a large-scale data center network with a file d-threshold policy,
which is to replicate each important file into at most d-1 other data centers
such that this file can maintain in the data center network under a given level
of data security in the long-term. To this end, we develop three relevant
Markov processes to propose two effective methods for assessing the file
lifetime and data security. By using the RG-factorizations, we show that the
two methods are used to be able to more effectively evaluate the file lifetime
of large-scale data center networks. We hope the methodology and results given

adversarial perturbations. Moreover, there exist input-agnostic noise, called
Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) that can affect inference of the
models over most input samples. Given a model, there exist broadly two
approaches to craft UAPs: (i) data-driven: that require data, and (ii)
data-free: that do not require data samples. Data-driven approaches require
actual samples from the underlying data distribution and craft UAPs with high
success (fooling) rate. However, data-free approaches craft UAPs without
utilizing any data samples and therefore result in lesser success rates. In
this paper, for data-free scenarios, we propose a novel approach that emulates
the effect of data samples with class impressions in order to craft UAPs using
data-driven objectives. Class impression for a given pair of category and model
is a generic representation (in the input space) of the samples belonging to
that category. Further, we present a neural network based generative model that
utilizes the acquired class impressions to learn crafting UAPs. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the learned generative model, (i) readily crafts
UAPs via simple feed-forwarding through neural network layers, and (ii)
achieves state-of-the-art success rates for data-free scenario and closer to
that for data-driven setting without actually utilizing any data samples.

simplifying procedures were developed: regrouping of paths into families of

symmetrical graphs with complicated topologies as, for instance, random graphs,
it can become cumbersome to choose the subgraphs and the families of paths. In
this work, an even more general procedure to construct the energy domain GF for
a quantum graph based on its adjacency matrix is presented. This new
construction allows us to obtain the secular determinant, unraveling a unitary
equivalence between the scattering Schr\""odinger approach and the Green's

facilitate freedom of speech and privacy. We present a proof of concept for a

to achieve time and frequency diversity, especially in linear time-variant
(LTV) channels with large Doppler frequencies. The idea is based on the
precoding of the data symbols using symplectic finite Fourier transform (SFFT)
then transmitting them by mean of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) waveform. Consequently, the demodulator and channel equalization can be
coupled in one processing step. As a distinguished feature, the demodulated
data symbols have roughly equal gain independent of the channel selectivity. On
the other hand, generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) modulation
also employs the spreading over the time and frequency domains using circular
filtering. Accordingly, the data symbols are implicitly precoded in a similar
way as applying SFFT in OTFS. In this paper, we present an extended
representation of GFDM which shows that OTFS can be processed as a GFDM signal
with simple permutation. Nevertheless, this permutation is the key factor
behind the outstanding performance of OTFS in LTV channels, as demonstrated in
this work. Furthermore, the representation of OTFS in the GFDM framework
provides an efficient implementation, that has been intensively investigated
for GFDM, and facilitates the understanding of the OTFS distinct features.

combined with the low-energy effective 4-band model, it was found that the bulk
inversion asymmetry directly determines the formation of the TDP for cubic
crystals. The projected surface states and corresponding patterns of the fermi
arcs with and without tensile strain were investigated for two different
crystal face orientations [(111) and (110)], both of which could be detected

the TDP of semimetals and superconductivity, can be explored.

compilers supporting the same programming model like High Performance Fortran

theoretical framework on which the ViPIOS design is based. This model describes
the mapping of the problem specific data space starting from the application
program data structures down to the physical layout on disk across several
intermediate representation levels.
  Based on this formal model we designed and developed an I/O runtime system,
ViPIOS, which provides support for several issues, as - parallel access to
files for read/write operations, - optimization of data-layout on disks, -
redistribution of data stored on disks, - communication of out-of-core (OOC)

applications involving continuous distribution of resources and utilization of

Traditional decision making methods involve extensive human participation, are
expensive, and inefficient and unreliable for hard-to-predict situations.
Modern technology, including ubiquitous data collection though sensors,
automated analysis and prognosis, and online optimization, offers new
capabilities for developing flexible, autonomous, scalable, efficient, and
predictable control methods. This paper presents a new decision making concept
in which a hierarchy of semantically more abstract models are utilized to
perform online scalable and predictable control. The lower semantic levels
perform localized decisions based on sampled data from the environment, while
the higher semantic levels provide more global, time invariant results based on
aggregated data from the lower levels. There is a continuous feedback between
the levels of the semantic hierarchy, in which the upper levels set performance
guaranteeing constraints for the lower levels, while the lower levels indicate
whether these constraints are feasible or not. Even though the semantic
hierarchy is not tied to a particular set of description models, the paper
illustrates a hierarchy used for traffic management applications and composed
of Finite State Machines, Conditional Task Graphs, Markov Decision Processes,
and functional graphs. The paper also summarizes some of the main research
problems that must be addressed as part of the proposed concept

the bounce, and that there is only one bounce. However, as we show in the
present work, the first assumption not only can be violated in a general
Horndeski/Galileon scenario, but also it is necessarily violated at the bounce
point within the subclass of Horndeski/Galileon gravity in which $K(\phi,X)$
becomes zero at $X=0$. Additionally, concerning the second assumption, which is
crucial in improved versions of the theorem which claim that even if a
nonlinear free of pathologies can be realized it will lead to pathologies in
the infinite past or infinite future, we show that if needed it can be evaded
by considering cyclic cosmology, with an infinite sequence of nonsingular
bounces free of pathologies, which forbids the universe to reach the
""problematic"" regime at infinite past or infinite future. Finally, in order to
make the analysis more transparent we provide explicit examples where
nonsingular bounces without theoretical pathologies can be achieved.

and organizations. While extensively explored from a variety of perspectives,
one issue which has received limited attention is human coordination in the
presence of adversarial agents. We study this problem by situating human
subjects as nodes on a network, and endowing each with a role, either regular
(with the goal of achieving consensus among all regular players), or
adversarial (aiming to prevent consensus among regular players). We show that
adversarial nodes are, indeed, quite successful in preventing consensus.
However, we demonstrate that having the ability to communicate among network
neighbors can considerably improve coordination success, as well as resilience
to adversarial nodes. Our analysis of communication suggests that adversarial
nodes attempt to exploit this capability for their ends, but do so in a
somewhat limited way, perhaps to prevent regular nodes from recognizing their
intent. In addition, we show that the presence of trusted nodes generally has
limited value, but does help when many adversarial nodes are present and
players can communicate. Finally, we use experimental data to develop a
computational model of human behavior, and explore a number of additional
parametric variations, such as features of network topologies, using the
resulting data-driven agent-based model.

powerful vector embeddings from Natural Language Processing with tools from
Graph Theory that exploit diffusive dynamics on graphs to reveal natural
partitions across scales. Our framework uses a recent deep neural network text
analysis methodology (Doc2vec) to represent text in vector form and then
applies a multi-scale community detection method (Markov Stability) to
partition a similarity graph of document vectors. The method allows us to
obtain clusters of documents with similar content, at different levels of
resolution, in an unsupervised manner. We showcase our approach with the
analysis of a corpus of 9,000 news articles published by Vox Media over one
year. Our results show consistent groupings of documents according to content
without a priori assumptions about the number or type of clusters to be found.
The multilevel clustering reveals a quasi-hierarchy of topics and subtopics

search of exoplanets by the means of Doppler spectroscopy, as planets with
lower masses become detectable. We report on the discovery of a planetary
companion around HD 180617, a bright J = 5.58 mag, low-mass M = 0.45 M_{sun}
star of spectral type M2.5 V. The star, located at a distance of 5.9 pc, is the
primary of the high proper motion binary system containing vB 10, a star with
one of the lowest masses known in most of the twentieth century. Our analysis
is based on new radial velocity (RV) measurements made at red-optical
wavelengths provided by the high-precision spectrograph CARMENES, which was
designed to carry out a survey for Earth-like planets around M dwarfs. The
available CARMENES data are augmented by archival Doppler measurements from
HIRES and HARPS. Altogether, the RVs span more than 16 years. The modeling of
the RV variations, with a semi-amplitude of K = 2.85-0.25/+0.16m/s yields a
Neptune-like planet with a minimum mass of 12.2-1.4/+1.0 M_{Earth} on a
105.90-0.10/+0.09d circumprimary orbit, which is partly located in the host
star's habitable zone. The analysis of time series of common activity
indicators does not show any dependence on the detected RV signal. The
discovery of HD 180617 b not only adds information to a currently hardly filled
region of the mass-period diagram of exoplanets around M dwarfs, but the
investigated system becomes the third known binary consisting of M dwarfs and
hosting an exoplanet in an S-type configuration. Its proximity makes it an
attractive candidate for future studies.

Android malware. The main problem facing the research community working on
devising techniques to detect this breed of malware is the lack of ground truth

crucial knowledge, it is difficult to train reliable classifiers able to
effectively classify novel, out-of-sample repackaged malware. To circumvent
this problem, we argue that reliable classifiers can be trained to detect
repackaged malware, if they are allowed to request new, more accurate
representations of an app's behavior. This learning technique is referred to as
active learning.
  In this paper, we propose the usage of active learning to train classifiers
able to cope with the ambiguous nature of repackaged malware. We implemented an
architecture, Aion, that connects the processes of stimulating and detecting
repackaged malware using a feedback loop depicting active learning. Our
evaluation of a sample implementation of Aion using two malware datasets
(Malgenome and Piggybacking) shows that active learning can outperform
conventional detection techniques and, hence, has great potential to detect

a solid-body rotation extending from the cluster center to the outermost
regions probed by the data, and a velocity dispersion profile initially
declining with the distance from the cluster's center, but flattening and
staying constant at ~5 km/s for distances larger than about one half-mass

pairs of Poisson points in a position dependent but independent way. We study
first and second order properties of the numbers of components isomorphic to
given finite connected graphs. For increasing observation windows in an

languages contribute to the trend that large software codebases are often
multilingual, that is, written in more than one computer language. While
developers can leverage monolingual software development tools to build
software components, companies are faced with the problem of managing the
resultant large, multilingual codebases to address issues with security,
efficiency, and quality metrics. The key challenge is to address the opaque
nature of the language interoperability interface: one language calling
procedures in a second (which may call a third, or even back to the first),
resulting in a potentially tangled, inefficient and insecure codebase. An
architecture is proposed for lightweight static analysis of large multilingual
codebases: the MLSA architecture. Its modular and table-oriented structure
addresses the open-ended nature of multiple languages and language
interoperability APIs. We focus here as an application on the construction of
call-graphs that capture both inter-language and intra-language calls. The
algorithms for extracting multilingual call-graphs from codebases are
presented, and several examples of multilingual software engineering analysis
are discussed. The state of the implementation and testing of MLSA is
presented, and the implications for future work are discussed.

the phononic signatures in the bias-voltage dependence of the electrical

temperature dependence of various thermoelectric coefficients to our earlier
results obtained within the numerical renormalization group [Phys.~Rev.~B {\bf

semi-transitive orientations to enumerate connected non-word-representable

  Also, a graph is word-representable iff it is $k$-representable for some $k$,
that is, if it can be represented using $k$ copies of each letter. The minimum
such $k$ for a given graph is called graph's representation number. Our

Gross-Neveu-Yukawa quantum phase transition of relativistic fermions with $N=4$
Dirac spinor components subject to a repulsive, local four fermion interaction
in 2+1$d$. Here we employ a two dimensional lattice Hamiltonian with a single,
spin-degenerate Dirac cone, which exactly reproduces a linear energy-momentum
relation for all finite size lattice momenta in the absence of interactions.
This allows us to significantly reduce finite size corrections compared to the
widely studied honeycomb and $\pi$-flux lattices. A Hubbard term dynamically
generates a mass beyond a critical coupling of ${U_c = 6.76(1)}$ as the system
acquires antiferromagnetic order and SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is
spontaneously broken. At the quantum phase transition we extract a
self-consistent set of critical exponents ${\nu = 0.98(1)}$, ${\eta_{\phi} =
0.53(1)}$, ${\eta_{\psi} = 0.18(1)}$, ${\beta = 0.75(1)}$. We provide evidence
for the continuous degradation of the quasi-particle weight of the fermionic
excitations as the critical point is approached from the semimetallic phase.
Finally we study the effective ""speed of light"" of the low-energy relativistic
description, which depends on the interaction $U$, but is expected to be
regular across the quantum phase transition. We illustrate that the strongly
coupled bosonic and fermionic excitations share a common velocity at the
critical point.

simulation of crashes and the evaluation of consequences on existing
microsimulation packages. A specific family of simple and reproducible conflict
indicators is proposed and applied to many case studies. In this approach
driver failures are simulated by assuming that a driver stops reacting to an
external stimulus and keeps driving at the current speed for a given time. The
trajectory of the distracted driver vehicle is thus evaluated and projected,
for the given time steps, for the established distraction time, over the actual
trajectories of other vehicles. Every occurring crash is then evaluated in
terms of energy involved in the crash, or with any other severity index (which
can be easily calculated since the accident dynamics can be accurately
simulated). The simulation of a driver error allows not only the typology of
crashes to be included, normally accounted for with surrogate safety measures,
but also many other type of typical crashes that it is impossible to simulate
with microsimulation and traditional methodologies being caused by vehicles who
are driving on non-conflicting trajectories such as drivers speeding at a red
light, drivers taking the wrong lane or side of the street or just driving off
the road in isolated accidents against external obstacles or traffic barriers.
The total crash energy of all crashes is proposed as an indicator of risk and
adopted in the case studies. Moreover, the concepts introduced in this paper
allow scientists to define other relevant variables that can be used as
surrogate safety indicators that consider driving errors. Preliminary results
on different case studies have shown a great accordance of safety evaluations
with statistical data and empirical expectations and also with other
traditional safety indicators that are commonly used in microsimulation.

surveillance systems with significant concern in security. Matching persons
across disjoint camera views in their video fragments is inherently challenging
due to the large visual variations and uncontrolled frame rates. There are two
steps crucial to person re-id, namely discriminative feature learning and
metric learning. However, existing approaches consider the two steps
independently, and they do not make full use of the temporal and spatial
information in videos. In this paper, we propose a Siamese attention
architecture that jointly learns spatiotemporal video representations and their
similarity metrics. The network extracts local convolutional features from
regions of each frame, and enhance their discriminative capability by focusing
on distinct regions when measuring the similarity with another pedestrian
video. The attention mechanism is embedded into spatial gated recurrent units
to selectively propagate relevant features and memorize their spatial
dependencies through the network. The model essentially learns which parts
(\emph{where}) from which frames (\emph{when}) are relevant and distinctive for
matching persons and attaches higher importance therein. The proposed Siamese
model is end-to-end trainable to jointly learn comparable hidden
representations for paired pedestrian videos and their similarity value.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of
each component of the proposed deep network while outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

using a bi-layer structure. In this paper, a two-dimensional mathematical model
describing the water evaporation in a bi-layer structure is firstly established
and then the finite element method is used to simulate the effects of different
influence factors on the evaporation rate. Results turn out that: besides the
high solar energy absorptivity of the first-layer, an optimum porosity of the
second-layer porous material should be applied and the optimum porosity is
about 0.45 in this work. This optimum porosity is determined by the balance
between the positive effect of the lowering effective thermal conductivity of
the second layer and the negative effect of the reduced vapor diffusivity in
the second layer when the porosity is decreased. The influence of the thermal
conductivity of the second-layer porous material is negligible because the
effective thermal conductivity of the second layer is determined by the
porosity while a larger porosity means more water in the second layer. The
ambient air velocity could greatly enhance the evaporation rate, and the
evaporation rate will decrease linearly with the increase of the air relative
humidity. This study is expected to supply some information for developing a
more effective bi-layer solar steam generation system.

the inequality to the new larger ranges $\geq x \log^{-c}x\leq y \leq x$, where
$c\geq 0$ is a constant, unconditionally; and for $\geq x^{1/2} \log^3x\leq y

collaborators to explore new and useful applications of visualization. The
early stages of collaborations are typically time consuming for all
stakeholders as researchers piece together an understanding of domain
challenges from disparate discussions and meetings. A number of recent
projects, however, report on the use of creative visualization-opportunities
(CVO) workshops to accelerate the early stages of applied work, eliciting a
wealth of requirements in a few days of focused work. Yet, there is no
established guidance for how to use such workshops effectively. In this paper,
we present the results of a 2-year collaboration in which we analyzed the use
of 17 workshops in 10 visualization contexts. Its primary contribution is a
framework for CVO workshops that: 1) identifies a process model for using
workshops; 2) describes a structure of what happens within effective workshops;
3) recommends 25 actionable guidelines for future workshops; and 4) presents an
example workshop and workshop methods. The creation of this framework
exemplifies the use of critical reflection to learn about visualization in
practice from diverse studies and experience.

and quantum cognition offers a fundamental strategy for modeling the meaning
associated with collections of documental entities. To do so, we take the World
Wide Web as a paradigmatic example and emphasize the importance of
distinguishing the Web, made of printed documents, from a more abstract meaning
entity, which we call the Quantum Web, or QWeb, where the former is considered
to be the collection of traces that can be left by the latter, in specific
measurements, similarly to how a non-spatial quantum entity, like an electron,
can leave localized traces of impact on a detection screen. The double-slit
experiment is extensively used to illustrate the rationale of the modeling,
which is guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory to describe the
behavior of the microscopic entities. We also emphasize that the superposition
principle and the associated interference effects are not sufficient to model
all experimental probabilistic data, like those obtained by counting the
relative number of documents containing certain words and co-occurrences of
words. For this, additional effects, like context effects, must also be taken
into consideration.

funds and asset managers. It computes the ratio of the excess return over the
strategy standard deviation. However, the elements to compute the Sharpe ratio,
namely, the expected returns and the volatilities are unknown numbers and need
to be estimated statistically. This means that the Sharpe ratio used by funds
is subject to be error prone because of statistical estimation error. Lo
(2002), Mertens (2002) derive explicit expressions for the statistical
distribution of the Sharpe ratio using standard asymptotic theory under several
sets of assumptions (independent normally distributed - and identically
distributed returns). In this paper, we provide the exact distribution of the
Sharpe ratio for independent normally distributed return. In this case, the
Sharpe ratio statistic is up to a rescaling factor a non centered Student
distribution whose characteristics have been widely studied by statisticians.
The asymptotic behavior of our distribution provide the result of Lo (2002). We
also illustrate the fact that the empirical Sharpe ratio is asymptotically
optimal in the sense that it achieves the Cramer Rao bound. We then study the
empirical SR under AR(1) assumptions and investigate the effect of compounding
period on the Sharpe (computing the annual Sharpe with monthly data for
instance). We finally provide general formula in this case of
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.

Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, i.e., per-channel scaling and
shifting. We propose to generate the parameters of FiLM layers going up the
hierarchy of a convolutional network in a multi-hop fashion rather than all at
once, as in prior work. By alternating between attending to the language input
and generating FiLM layer parameters, this approach is better able to scale to
settings with longer input sequences such as dialogue. We demonstrate that
multi-hop FiLM generation achieves state-of-the-art for the short input

significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art and single-hop FiLM

edge, doing so exposes the data to a sophisticated, vulnerable software stack
on the edge and hence security threats. To this end, we advocate isolating the
data and its computations in a trusted execution environment (TEE) on the edge,
shielding them from the remaining edge software stack which we deem untrusted.
This approach faces two major challenges: (1) executing high-throughput,
low-delay stream analytics in a single TEE, which is constrained by a low
trusted computing base (TCB) and limited physical memory; (2) verifying
execution of stream analytics as the execution involves untrusted software
components on the edge. In response, we present StreamBox-TZ (SBT), a stream
analytics engine for an edge platform that offers strong data security,
verifiable results, and good performance. SBT contributes a data plane designed
and optimized for a TEE based on ARM TrustZone. It supports continuous remote
attestation for analytics correctness and result freshness while incurring low
overhead. SBT only adds 42.5 KB executable to the TCB (16% of the entire TCB).
On an octa core ARMv8 platform, it delivers the state-of-the-art performance by
processing input events up to 140 MB/sec (12M events/sec) with sub-second
delay. The overhead incurred by SBT's security mechanism is less than 25%.

support a cooperating program abstraction. Instead of placing all functionality
into a single program, programs cooperate to complete tasks requested by users.
However, untrusted programs may exploit interactions with other programs to
obtain unauthorized access to system sensors either directly or through
privileged services. Researchers have proposed that programs should only be
authorized to access system sensors on a user-approved input event, but these
methods do not account for possible delegation done by the program receiving
the user input event. Furthermore, proposed delegation methods do not enable
users to control the use of their input events accurately. In this paper, we
propose ENTRUST, a system that enables users to authorize sensor operations
that follow their input events, even if the sensor operation is performed by a
program different from the program receiving the input event. ENTRUST tracks
user input as well as delegation events and restricts the execution of such
events to compute unambiguous delegation paths to enable accurate and reusable
authorization of sensor operations. To demonstrate this approach, we implement
the ENTRUST authorization system for Android. We find, via a laboratory user
study, that attacks can be prevented at a much higher rate (54-64%
improvement); and via a field user study, that ENTRUST requires no more than
three additional authorizations per program with respect to the first-use
approach, while incurring modest performance (<1%) and memory overheads (5.5 KB
per program).

Linear-carrier fringes are normally obtained using feedback, closed-loop,

devices, usually give fringe patterns with nonlinear phase-shifts. The Fourier
spectrum of linear-carrier fringes is composed by Dirac deltas only. In
contrast, nonlinear phase-shifted fringes are wideband, spread-spectrum
signals. It is well known that using linear-phase reference PSA to demodulate
nonlinear phase-shifted fringes, one obtains an spurious-piston. The problem
with this spurious-piston, is that it may wrongly be taken as a real optical
thickness. Here we mathematically find the origin of this spurious-piston and
