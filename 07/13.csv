we explore the momentum and spin entanglement created by the interaction. We
show that a particular discretisation provides an estimate of the von Neumann
entropy of the one-electron reduced density matrix from the experimentally
accessible Shannon entropy. For spinless distinguishable electrons the entropy
is sizeable at low energies, indicating strong momentum entanglement, and drops
to almost zero at energies of the order of 10 keV when the azimutal degree of
freedom is integrated out, i.e. practically no entanglement and almost pure
one-electron states. If spin is taken into account, the entropy for electrons
with antiparallel spins should be larger than in the parallel-spin case, since
it embodies both momentum and spin entanglement. Surprisingly, this difference,
as well as the deviation from the spin-less case, is extremely small for the
complete scattering state. Strong spin entanglement can however be obtained by
post-selecting states at scattering angle pi/2.

quasi-Gaussian uncertainties, calibrated from Monte Carlo simulations and
tailored to observables (crowding, residual maps). Comparison to ALMA
photometry for hundreds of sources provide a remarkable validation of the
technique. We detect 11,220 galaxies over the 100--1200~$\mu$m range, extending
to $z_{\rm phot}\sim7$. We conservatively selected a sample of 85 $z>4$ high

investigate the first generation of vigorous starburst galaxies

  To appear in Journal of Functional Analysis",,,,"math.CA math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we establish the existence of extremals for two kinds of
Stein-Weiss inequalities on the Heisenberg group. More precisely, we prove the
existence of extremals for the Stein-Weiss inequalities with full weights in
Theorem 1.1 and the Stein-Weiss inequalities with horizontal weights in Theorem
1.4. Different from the proof of the analogous inequality in Euclidean spaces
given by Lieb [26] using Riesz rearrangement inequality which is not available
on the Heisenberg group, we employ the concentration compactness principle to
obtain the existence of the maximizers on the Heisenberg group. Our result is
also new even in the Euclidean case because we don't assume that the exponents
of the double weights in the Stein-Weiss inequality (1.1) are both nonnegative
(see Theorem 1.3 and more generally Theorem 1.5). Therefore, we extend Lieb's
celebrated result of the existence of extremal functions of the Stein-Weiss
inequality in the Euclidean space to the case where the exponents are not
necessarily both nonnegative (see Theorem 1.3). Furthermore, since the absence
of translation invariance of the Stein-Weiss inequalities, additional
difficulty presents and one cannot simply follow the same line of Lions' idea
to obtain our desired result. Our methods can also be used to obtain the
existence of optimizers for several other weighted integral inequalities
(Theorem 1.5).

decaying, smooth symbol $\sigma:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$. Let $P\subset
\mathbb{R}^2$ be the interior of a polygon and, for $L\geq 1$, define its
scaled version $P_L:=L\cdot P$. Then we study the spectral asymptotics for the
operator $A_{P_L}=\chi_{P_L}A\chi_{P_L}$, the spatial restriction of $A$ onto
$P_L$: for entire functions $h$ with $h(0)=0$ we provide a complete asymptotic
expansion of $\operatorname{tr}h(A_{P_L})$ as $L\to\infty$. These trace
asymptotics consist of three terms that reflect the geometry of the polygon. If
$P$ is replaced by a domain with smooth boundary, a complete asymptotic
expansion of the trace has been known for more than 30 years. However, for
polygons the formula for the constant order term in the asymptotics is new. In
particular, we show that each corner of the polygon produces an extra
contribution; as a consequence, the constant order term exhibits an anomaly
similar to the heat trace asymptotics for the Dirichlet Laplacian.

However, one major obstacle towards applying such methods to real-world
problems is their lack of data-efficiency. To this end, we propose the
Bottleneck Simulator: a model-based reinforcement learning method which
combines a learned, factorized transition model of the environment with rollout
simulations to learn an effective policy from few examples. The learned
transition model employs an abstract, discrete (bottleneck) state, which
increases sample efficiency by reducing the number of model parameters and by
exploiting structural properties of the environment. We provide a mathematical
analysis of the Bottleneck Simulator in terms of fixed points of the learned
policy, which reveals how performance is affected by four distinct sources of
error: an error related to the abstract space structure, an error related to
the transition model estimation variance, an error related to the transition
model estimation bias, and an error related to the transition model class bias.
Finally, we evaluate the Bottleneck Simulator on two natural language
processing tasks: a text adventure game and a real-world, complex dialogue
response selection task. On both tasks, the Bottleneck Simulator yields
excellent performance beating competing approaches.

neutron star's internal structure, such a measurement will constrain the
equation of state of ultra-dense matter, which is believed to be universal.
Independent equation-of-state constraints have already been established by the
gravitational-wave measurement of the neutron-star tidal deformability in
GW170817. Here, using well-known universal relations among neutron star
observables, we translate the reported 90%-credible bounds on tidal
deformability into a direct constraint, $I_{\star} = 1.15^{+0.38}_{-0.24}

applications in photonic quantum information processing and quantum
communications. Here, we present an approach based on a solid-state cavity
containing an ensemble of rare-earth ions. First a probe pulse containing many
photons is stored in the ensemble. Then a single signal photon, which
represents a time-bin qubit, imprints a phase on the ensemble that is due to
the AC Stark effect. This phase does not depend on the exact timing of the
signal photon, which makes the detection insensitive to the time-bin qubit
state. Then the probe pulse is retrieved and its phase is detected via homodyne
detection. We show that the cavity leads to a dependence of the imprinted phase
on the {\it probe} photon number, which leads to a spreading of the probe
phase, in contrast to the simple shift that occurs in the absence of a cavity.
However, we show that this scenario still allows non-destructive detection of
the signal. We discuss potential implementations of the scheme, showing that
high success probability and low loss should be simultaneously achievable.

sparse auto-encoder (CRsAE), that answers this question in the affirmative.
Given an input signal and an approximate dictionary, the encoder finds a sparse
approximation using FISTA. The decoder reconstructs the signal by applying the
dictionary to the output of the encoder. The encoder and decoder in CRsAE
parallel the sparse-coding and dictionary update steps in optimization-based
alternating-minimization schemes for dictionary learning. As such, the
parameters of the encoder and decoder are not independent, a constraint which
we enforce for the first time. We derive the back-propagation algorithm for
CRsAE. CRsAE is a framework for blind source separation that, only knowing the
number of sources (dictionary elements), and assuming sparsely-many can
overlap, is able to separate them. We demonstrate its utility in the context of
spike sorting, a source separation problem in computational neuroscience. We
demonstrate the ability of CRsAE to recover the underlying dictionary and
characterize its sensitivity as a function of SNR.

color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of young and intermediate-age star clusters in
the Magellanic Clouds. The nature of eMSTOs is still debated. The most popular
scenarios are extended star formation and ranges of stellar rotation rates.
Here we study implications of a kink feature in the main sequence (MS) of young
star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This kink shows up very
clearly in new \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} observations of the 700-Myr-old
cluster NGC 1831, and is located below the region in the CMD where multiple or
wide MSes, which are known to occur in young clusters and thought to be due to
varying rotation rates, merge together into a single MS. The kink occurs at an
initial stellar mass of $1.45 \pm 0.02\;M_{\odot}$; we posit that it represents
a lower limit to the mass below which the effects of rotation on the energy
output of stars are rendered negligible at the metallicity of these clusters.
Evaluating the positions of stars with this initial mass in CMDs of massive LMC
star clusters with ages of $\sim\,$1.7 Gyr that feature wide eMSTOs, we find
that such stars are located in a region where the eMSTO is already
significantly wider than the MS below it. This strongly suggests that stellar
rotation \emph{cannot} fully explain the wide extent of eMSTOs in massive
intermediate-age clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. A distribution of stellar
ages still seems necessary to explain the eMSTO phenomenon.

exhibits the high-velocity component indicative of outflows, roughly equally
split into winds driven by star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei
(AGN). The incidence of SF-driven winds correlates mainly with star formation
properties. These outflows have typical velocities of ~450 km/s, local electron
densities of n_e~380 cm^-3, modest mass loading factors of ~0.1-0.2 at all
galaxy masses, and energetics compatible with momentum driving by young stellar
populations. The SF-driven winds may escape from log(M*/Msun)<10.3 galaxies but
substantial mass, momentum, and energy in hotter and colder outflow phases seem
required to account for low galaxy formation efficiencies in the low-mass

above log(M*/Msun)~10.7, in up to ~75% of log(M*/Msun)>11.2 galaxies. The
incidence, strength, and velocity of AGN-driven winds strongly correlates with
stellar mass and central concentration. Their outflowing ionized gas appears
denser (n_e~1000 cm^-3), and possibly compressed and shock-excited. These winds
have comparable mass loading factors as the SF-driven winds but carry ~10 (~50)

multi-messenger constraints on the source modeling. We show that luminous
neutrino flares should be accompanied by luminous broadband cascade emission,
emerging also in X-rays and gamma-rays. This implies that not only gamma-ray
telescopes like Fermi but also X-ray sky monitors such as Swift and MAXI are

the dynamical response to gas expulsion (i.e. violent relaxation), when the
cluster age is 20-30 Myr}. We consider the ""initial"" mass to be consistent with
other works which neglect violent relaxation. The model clusters formed with a
high star formation efficiency (SFE -- i.e. gas mass fraction converted into
stars) follow a tight mass-dependent relation, in agreement with previous
theoretical studies. However, the low-SFE models present a large scatter in
both the ""initial"" mass and the dissolution time, and a shallower
mass-dependent relation than high-SFE clusters. Both groups differ in their
structural properties on the average. Combining two populations of clusters,
high- and low-SFE ones, with domination of the latter, yields a cluster
dissolution time for the solar neighborhood in agreement with that inferred
from observations, without any additional destructive processes such as giant
molecular cloud encounters.
  An apparent mass-independent relation may emerge for our low-SFE clusters

accompanied by an unusually weak short GRB 170817A, by an optical/IR
macronova/kilonova and by a long lasting radio to X-rays counterpart. While
association of short GRBs with mergers was predicted a long time ago, the
luminosity of this prompt {\gamma}-ray emission was weaker by a few orders of
magnitude than all known previous sGRBs and it was softer than typical sGRBs.
This raise the question whether the {\gamma}-rays that we have seen were a
regular sGRB viewed off-axis. We revisit this question following recent refined
analyses of the {\gamma}-ray signal and the VLBI observations that revealed the
angular structure of the relativistic outflow: observing angle of
$\sim\,20^\circ$, a narrow jet with core $\lesssim5^\circ$ and $E_{\rm
iso}>10^{52}\,{\rm ergs}$. We show here that: (i) The region emitting the
observed $\gamma$-rays must have been moving with a Lorentz factor
$\Gamma\gtrsim5$; (ii) The observed {\gamma}-rays were not ""off-axis"" emission
(viewing angle $>1/\Gamma$) emerging from the core of the jet, where a regular
sGRB was most likely produced; (iii) The $\gamma$-ray emission region was
either ""on-axis"" (at an angle $<1/\Gamma$) or if it was ""off-axis"" then the
observing angle must have been small ($<5^\circ$) and the on-axis emission from
this region was too faint and too hard to resemble a regular sGRB.

high resolution X-ray spectroscopy might enable a measurement of the radial
velocity curve of the compact object by monitoring the Doppler shifts induced
by the orbital motion of the disc wind or the disc atmosphere. We analysed a
Chandra-HETG+NuSTAR soft state observation of MXB 1659-298, an eclipsing
neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). We measured a radial velocity curve
whose phase offset and semi-amplitude are consistent with the primary star. We
derived the value for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity for the compact
object $K_1=89\pm19$ km s$^{-1}$, constrained the mass of the secondary
($0.3\leq M_2\leq0.8$ M$_\odot$) and the orbital inclination of the binary
system ($73\leq i\leq77^\circ$). These values are consistent with previous
estimates from independent methods. Via the same technique, the next generation
of X-ray observatories equipped with high spectral resolution instruments
(e.g., Athena) will have the potential to measure the radial velocity curve of
the primary in high inclination X-ray binaries to an accuracy of a few per

the stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio ($M_\ast/M_{dyn}$) of SC1604 galaxies to
those residing in less dense local environment by leveraging data from the
HR-COSMOS sample. We found that, at fixed stellar mass, SC1604 galaxies have
$\sim30\%$ smaller dynamical masses on average. By comparing the distributions
of the galaxy parameters that define $M_{dyn}$ (i.e., circular velocity and the
characteristic radius $r_{2.2}$) between SC1604 and HR-COSMOS, we found that
smaller dynamical masses are mostly caused by smaller $r_{2.2}$ for SC1604
galaxies. We also observed that SC1604 galaxies in general show $\sim20\%$

stellar-mass and supermassive BHs. Recently IMBHs have started to be observed
at the centers of low-mass galaxies. We perform cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations of $(2 h^{-1} ~ {\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes and investigate the
growth and feedback of central IMBHs in dwarf galaxies (DGs). The earliest BHs
appear at $z \sim 18 - 25$, and grow thereafter by accreting gas and by merger
with other BHs. We find that, starting from $10^{2} M_{\odot}$, it is possible
to build up IMBHs of a few$\times 10^{5} - 10^{6} M_{\odot}$ by $z = 5$, when
the BHs are seeded in halos less massive than $4 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$. The
BH accretion rates increase with time, and reaches $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} = (0.2 -
0.8) \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ for the massive IMBHs by $z = 4$. The star formation
rate density (SFRD) evolution of the DGs (stellar mass $10^{5} - 10^{8}
M_{\odot}$) has a peak plateau between $z = 4 - 6$. Star formation is quenched
between $z = 9 - 4$. The SFRD is reduced by factors up to $3$, when the BHs
have grown to a few times $10^5 M_{\odot}$. Even in the presence of stronger
SN-driven mass ejection, the BHs continue to grow up to $z \sim 6$, sustained
by gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers and interactions in a cosmological
environment. Our conclusions, based on numerical simulation results, support
the scenario that early feedback from IMBHs in gas-rich DGs at $z = 5 - 8$ can
potentially solve several anomalies in the DG mass range within the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario (Silk 2017). Our results suggest that IMBHs
at DG centers grow faster than their host galaxies in the early Universe, and
the resulting BH feedback turns the DGs and the BHs dormant.

Intentionally patterning monolayer graphene at the contact region creates
well-defined edge contacts that lead to a 67% enhancement in current injection
from a gold contact. Specific contact resistivity is reduced from 1372
{\Omega}m for a device with surface contacts to 456 {\Omega}m when contacts are
patterned with holes. Electrostatic doping of the graphene further reduces
contact resistivity from 519 {\Omega}m to 45 {\Omega}m, a substantial decrease

simulations. The data is analyzed with regards to the edge perimeter and
hole-to-graphene ratio, which provides insights into optimized contact

characterizes the energy partitioning between protons and electrons
($T_p/T_e$), proton temperature anisotropy ($T_{\perp}/T_{||}$) and scalar
proton temperature ($T_p$) in a way that is consistent with previous
predictions. For a fixed $\delta B_i$, the ratio of linear to nonlinear
timescales is strongly correlated with the scalar proton temperature in
agreement with Matthaeus et al., though for solar wind intervals with
$\beta_{||p}>1$ some discrepancies are found. For a fixed $\beta_{||p}$, an
increase of the turbulence amplitude leads to higher $T_p/T_e$ ratios, which is
consistent with the models of Chandran et al. and Wu et al. We discuss the
implications of these findings for our understanding of plasma turbulence.

strong magnetoelectric coupling effects. Here, we establish the temperature and
strain dependent ferroic phase diagram of SrMnO$_3$ using
first-principles-based effective Hamiltonians. All parameters of these
Hamiltonians are calculated using density functional theory, i.e., no fitting

a moderate variation of the corresponding critical temperatures. In contrast,
the ferroelectric Curie temperature increases strongly after its onset around
2.5\,\% strain, and indeed crosses the magnetic transition temperature just
above 3\,\% strain. Our results indicate pronounced magnetoelectric coupling,
manifested in dramatic changes of the magnetic ordering temperatures and
different magnetic ground states as function of the ferroelectric distortion.
In addition, coexisting ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order is obtained for
strains above 4\,\%. Our calculated phase diagram suggests the possibility to
control the magnetic properties of SrMnO$_3$ through an applied electric field,

PHASECam's phase unwrapping algorithm, which attempts to mitigate this issue,
still occasionally fails in the case of fast, large phase variations. This can
cause a fringe jump, in which case the unwrapped phase will be incorrect by a

evolution, but a complete self-consistent theory of these processes is still to
be developed. Processes such as radiative shielding due to a~hot-spot region,
or a~hydrodynamical interaction of different parts of the gas stream have been
studied previously. In order to test the respective predictions, it is
necessary to carry out detailed observations of binaries undergoing the
largescale mass exchange, especially for those that are in the rapid transfer
phase. \bla is an archetype of such a system, having a long and rich
observational history. Our goal for this first study is to quantitatively
estimate the geometry and physical properties of the optically thick
components, namely the Roche-lobe filling mass-losing star, and the accretion
disk surrounding the mass-gaining star of \blae. A series of continuum visible
and NIR spectro-interferometric observations by the NPOI, CHARA/MIRC and VEGA
instruments covering the whole orbit of \bla acquired during a~two-week
campaign in 2013 were complemented with \ubvr\ photometric observations
acquired during a three-year monitoring of the system. We included NUV and FUV

that gives rise to bands of non-ergodic extended (NEE) quantum states each
formed by a superposition of a large number of computational states (deep local
minima of the energy landscape) with similar energies. NEE provide a mechanism
for population transfer (PT) between computational states and therefore can
serve as a new quantum subroutine for quantum search, quantum parallel
tempering and reverse annealing optimization algorithms. We study PT in a
quantum n-spin system subject to a transverse field where the energy function
$E(z)$ encodes a classical optimization problem over the set of spin
configurations $z$. Given an initial spin configuration with low energy, PT
protocol searches for other bitstrings at energies within a narrow window
around the initial one. We provide an analytical solution for PT in a simple
yet nontrivial model: $M$ randomly chosen marked bit-strings are assigned
energies $E(z)$ within a narrow strip $[-n -W/2, n + W/2]$, while the rest of
the states are assigned energy 0. We find that the scaling of a typical PT
runtime with n and L is the same as that in the multi-target Grover's quantum
search algorithm, except for a factor that is equal to $\exp(n /(2B^2))$ for
finite transverse field $B\gg1$. Unlike the Hamiltonians used in analog quantum
unstructured search algorithms known so far, the model we consider is
non-integrable and population transfer is not exponentially sensitive in n to
the weight of the driver Hamiltonian. We study numerically the PT subroutine as

predictive performance subject to a fixed annotation budget. In AL one
iteratively selects training examples for annotation, often those for which the

sampling leads to better performance than would be achieved under independent

in retrospective evaluations, these studies often ignore practical obstacles to

with specific models and for particular domains, the benefits of current
approaches do not generalize reliably across models and tasks. This is
problematic because in practice one does not have the opportunity to explore
and compare alternative AL strategies. Moreover, AL couples the training
dataset with the model used to guide its acquisition. We find that subsequently
training a successor model with an actively-acquired dataset does not
consistently outperform training on i.i.d. sampled data. Our findings raise the
question of whether the downsides inherent to AL are worth the modest and

al. [SODA 2017] and the $O(n^{3/2}\log (nC))$ algorithm of Gabow and Tarjan
[SIAM J. Comput. 1989].
  For a graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices, the well-known Hungarian
Algorithm computes a shortest augmenting path in each phase in $O(m)$ time,
yielding an optimal matching in $O(mn)$ time. The Hopcroft-Karp [SIAM J.
Comput. 1973], and Gabow-Tarjan [SIAM J. Comput. 1989] algorithms compute, in
each phase, a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths (for
appropriately defined costs) in $O(m)$ time. This reduces the number of phases
from $n$ to $O(\sqrt{n})$ and the total execution time to $O(m\sqrt{n})$.
  In order to obtain our speed-up, we relax the conditions on the augmenting
paths and iteratively compute, in each phase, a set of carefully selected
augmenting paths that are not restricted to be shortest or vertex-disjoint. As
a result, our algorithm computes substantially more augmenting paths in each
phase, reducing the number of phases from $O(\sqrt{n})$ to $O(n^{2/5})$. By
using small vertex separators, the execution of each phase takes $\tilde{O}(m)$
time on average. For planar graphs, we combine our algorithm with efficient
shortest path data structures to obtain a minimum-cost perfect matching in
$\tilde{O}(n^{6/5} \log{(nC)})$ time. This improves upon the recent
$\tilde{O}(n^{4/3}\log{(nC)})$ time algorithm by Asathulla et al. [SODA 2018].

monopole creation operator to the vacuum. We calculate the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the overlap Dirac operator that preserves the exact chiral
symmetry in lattice gauge theory using these QCD vacua. We then investigate the
effects of magnetic monopoles and instantons. First, we confirm the monopole
effects as follows: (i) The monopole creation operator makes the monopoles and
anti-monopoles in the QCD vacuum. (ii) A monopole and anti-monopole pair
creates an instanton or anti-instanton without changing the structure of the
QCD vacuum. (iii) The monopole and anti-monopole pairs change only the scale of
the spectrum distribution without affecting the spectra of the Dirac operator
by comparing the spectra with random matrix theory. Next, we find the instanton
effects by increasing the number density of the instantons and anti-instantons
as follows: (iv) The decay constants of the pseudoscalar increase. (v) The
values of the chiral condensate, which are defined as negative numbers,
decrease. (vi) The light quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons become heavy. The
catalytic effect on the charged pion is estimated using the numerical results
of the pion decay constant and the pion mass. (vii) The decay width of the
charged pion becomes wider than the experimental result, and the lifetime of
the charged pion becomes shorter than the experimental result. These are the
effects of the monopoles and instantons in QCD.

We show that this ""physical preprocessing"" allows for improved image

  Fourier ptychographic microscopy is a technique allowing for both high
resolution and high field-of-view at the cost of temporal resolution. In
Fourier ptychographic microscopy, variable illumination patterns are used to
collect multiple low-resolution images. These low-resolution images are then
computationally combined to create an image with resolution exceeding that of
any single image from the microscope. We use deep learning to jointly optimize
the illumination pattern with the post-processing reconstruction algorithm for
a given sample type, allowing for single-shot imaging with both high resolution
and high field-of-view. We demonstrate, with simulated data, that the joint
optimization yields improved image reconstruction as compared with sole
optimization of the post-processing reconstruction algorithm.

to allow the robot to evaluate a risk associated with several methods of
completing the same task by combining a set of action sequences. If the
environment is known and in the absence of sensing errors each set of actions
would successfully complete the task. In this paper, instead of attempting to
model the errors associated with each sensing system in order to compute an
exact solution, a set of solutions are obtained along with a prescribed risk
index. The risk associated with each set of actions can then be compared to
possible payoffs or rewards, for instance task completion time or power
consumption. This information is then sent to a high level decision planner,
for instance a human teleoperator, who can then make a more informed decision
regarding the robots actions. In order to illustrate the concept, we introduce
three specific risk measures, namely, the collision risk and the risk of
toppling and failure risk associated with grasping an object. We demonstrate
the results from this foundational study of risk-aware compositional robot
autonomy in simulation using NASA's Valkyrie humanoid robot, and the grasping

inspired a large amount of research into designing theoretical models of
self-assembling systems, and even laboratory-based implementations of them,
these artificial models and systems often tend to be lacking in one of the
powerful features of natural systems (e.g. the assembly and folding of
proteins), namely the dynamic reconfigurability of structures. In this paper,
we present a new mathematical model of self-assembly, based on the abstract
Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), called the Flexible Tile Assembly Model (FTAM). In
the FTAM, the individual components are 2-dimensional square tiles as in the
aTAM, but in the FTAM, bonds between the edges of tiles can be flexible,
allowing bonds to flex and entire structures to reconfigure, thus allowing
2-dimensional components to form 3-dimensional structures. We analyze the
powers and limitations of FTAM systems by (1) demonstrating how flexibility can
be controlled to carefully build desired structures, and (2) showing how
flexibility can be beneficially harnessed to form structures which can
""efficiently"" reconfigure into many different configurations and/or greatly
varying configurations. We also show that with such power comes a heavy burden
in terms of computational complexity of simulation and prediction by proving
that, for important properties of FTAM systems, determining their existence is
intractable, even for properties which are easily computed for systems in less

such an strategy, vehicles attempt to $(i)$ discover and $(ii)$ reserve
subchannels with low interference that may have the potential to maximize the
reception likelihood of their own broadcasted safety messages. However, due to
dynamicity of the vehicular environment, the subchannels optimality may
fluctuate rapidly over time. As a consequence, vehicles are required to make a
new selection every few hundreds of milliseconds. In consonance with 3GPP, the
subchannel selection phase relies on the linear average of the perceived power
intensities on each of the subchannels during a monitoring window. However, in
this paper we propose a nonlinear power averaging phase, where the most
up--to--date measurements are assigned higher priority via exponential
weighting. We show through simulations that the overall system performance can
be leveraged in both urban and freeway scenarios. Furthermore, the linear
averaging can be considered as a special case of the exponentially-weighted
moving average, ensuring backward compatibility with the standardized method.

of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of weather disturbances. In
our problem setting, the group of UAVs are required to collaboratively visit a
set of goals scattered in a 2-dimensional area. Each UAV will have to spend
energy to reach these goals, but due to unforeseen disturbances, the required
energy may vary over time and does not necessarily conform with the initial
forecast and/or pre-computed optimal paths. Thus, we are dealing with two
fundamental interrelated problems to find a global optimum at each point of
time: (1) energy consumption prediction based on disturbances and, hence,
online path replanning, and (2) distributed agreement among all UAVs to divide
the remaining unvisited goals based on their positions and energy requirements.
Our approach consists of four main components: (i) a distributed algorithm that
periodically divides the unvisited goals among all the UAVs based on the
current energy requirements of the UAVs, (ii) a local (i.e., UAV-level)
$\AStar$-based algorithm that computes the {\em desirable} path for each UAV to
reach the nodes assigned to it, (iii) a local PID controller that {\em

vehicle--to--everything (C-V2X) communications wherein two modalities were
introduced. One of these schemes, known as \textit{mode-3}, requires support
from eNodeBs in order to realize subchannel scheduling. This paper discusses a
graph theoretical approach for semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) in
\textit{mode-3} harnessing a sensing mechanism whereby vehicles can monitor
signal--to--interference--plus--noise ratio (SINR) levels across sidelink
subchannels. eNodeBs request such measurements from vehicles and utilize them
to accomplish suitable subchannel assignments. However, since SINR
values---herein also referred to as side information---span a wide range,
quantization is required. We conclude that 3 bits per vehicle every 100 ms can
provide sufficient granularity to maintain appropriate performance without
severe degradation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared against
pseudo-random and greedy SPS algorithms.

applications which exhibit adaptive behavior due to mode switching at run-time,
may degrade system predictability due to unknown behavior of the application
during mode transitions. Therefore, proper temporal analysis during mode
transitions is imperative to preserve system predictability. To this end, in
this paper, we initially introduce Mode Aware Data Flow (MADF) which is our new
predictable Model of Computation (MoC) to efficiently capture the behavior of
adaptive streaming applications. Then, as an important part of the operational
semantics of MADF, we propose the Maximum-Overlap Offset (MOO) which is our
novel protocol for mode transitions. The main advantage of this transition
protocol is that, in contrast to self-timed transition protocols, it avoids
timing interference between modes upon mode transitions. As a result, any mode
transition can be analyzed independently from the mode transitions that
occurred in the past. Based on this transition protocol, we propose a hard
real-time analysis as well to guarantee timing constraints by avoiding
processor overloading during mode transitions. Therefore, using this protocol,
we can derive a lower bound and an upper bound on the earliest starting time of
the tasks in the new mode during mode transitions in such a way that hard
real-time constraints are respected.

increased qubit coherence times. At base temperature, through Hahn echo

high-demand capacity by the 5th generation (5G) wireless networks. However, to
fully exploit the available spectrum, obstacles such as high path loss, channel
sparsity, and hardware complexity should be overcome. To this end, the present
paper aims to design a new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system using
lens-based multi-beam reconfigurable antennas. The proposed MIMO system uses
complete lens at the transmitter and incomplete lens at the receiver. To reduce
hardware complexity, we utilize an optimal beam selection technique. Our
analysis demonstrates that the proposed MIMO system along with the optimal beam
selection technique increases the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also,
simulations show that the system achieves full-diversity gain.

overlaid by dense millimeter wave (mmWave) pico BSs. These two-tier BSs, which
are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson Point Processes, cache
multimedia contents following the popularity rank. High-capacity backhauls are
utilized between macro BSs and the core server. In contrast to the simplified
flat-top antenna pattern analyzed in previous articles, we employ an actual
antenna model with the uniform linear array at all mmWave BSs. To evaluate the
performance of our system, we introduce two distinctive user association
strategies: 1) maximum received power (Max-RP) scheme; and 2) maximum rate
(Max-Rate) scheme. With the aid of these two schemes, we deduce new theoretical
equations for success probabilities and area spectral efficiencies (ASEs).
Considering a special case with practical path loss laws, several closed-form
expressions for coverage probabilities are derived to gain several insights.
Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the analytical conclusions. We
show that: 1) the proposed HetNet is an interference-limited system and it
outperforms the traditional HetNets in terms of the success probability; 2)
there exists an optimal pre-decided rate threshold that contributes to the
maximum ASE; and 3) Max-Rate achieves higher success probability and ASE than
Max-RP but it needs the extra information of the interference effect.

bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) and
potentially improves the bandwidth efficiency. However, for higher order signal
constellations, finding suitable MD mappings is a very complicated task due to
the large number of possible mappings. In this paper, a novel mapping method is
introduced to construct efficient MD mappings to improve the error performance
of BICM-ID over Rayleigh fading
  channels. We propose to break the MD mapping design problem into four
distinct $2$-D mapping functions. The $2$-D mappings are designed such that the
resulting MD mapping improves the BICM-ID error performance at low signal to
noise ratios (SNRs). We also develop cost functions that can be optimized to
improve the error performance at high SNRs. The proposed mapping method is very
simple compared to well-known mapping methods, and it can achieve suitable MD
mappings for different modulations including higher order modulations for
BICM-ID. Simulation results show that our mappings significantly outperform the
previously known mappings at a target bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-6}$. Our
mappings also offer a lower error-floor compared to their well-known
counterparts.

monitoring of glaucoma. Previously, machine learning techniques have utilized
segmentation-based imaging features such as the peripapillary RNFL thickness

classifies eyes as healthy or glaucomatous directly from raw, unsegmented OCT
volumes of the optic nerve head (ONH) using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). We compared the accuracy of this technique with various feature-based
machine learning algorithms and demonstrated the superiority of the proposed

  Logistic regression was found to be the best performing classical machine
learning technique with an AUC of 0.89. In direct comparison, the deep learning
approach achieved a substantially higher AUC of 0.94 with the additional
advantage of providing insight into which regions of an OCT volume are
important for glaucoma detection.
  Computing Class Activation Maps (CAM), we found that the CNN identified
neuroretinal rim and optic disc cupping as well as the lamina cribrosa (LC) and
its surrounding areas as the regions significantly associated with the glaucoma
classification. These regions anatomically correspond to the well established
and commonly used clinical markers for glaucoma diagnosis such as increased cup
volume, cup diameter, and neuroretinal rim thinning at the superior and
inferior segments.

(=lifting) vector bundles on $S$, to vector bundles on $W_r(S)$. We first study
two elementary but significant cases, in which the answer is positive: line
bundles, and the tautological vector bundle of a projective bundle over an
affine base. We give several applications, showcasing the systematic use of the
Teichm\""uller lift of line bundles. First, we offer a simple formulation of
classical results in deformation theory of smooth varieties over a field $k$ of

determine the learning trajectories using two measures, namely, the
predictability that yields the probability that two randomly chosen

dissimilarity between two learning trajectories. We find that the
predictability is greater in rugged landscapes than in smooth ones. The mean
path divergence, however, is strongly affected by the search parameters --
population size and imitation propensity -- that obliterate the influence of
the underlying landscape. The learning trajectories become more deterministic,
in the sense that there are fewer distinct trajectories and those trajectories
are more similar to each other, with increasing population size and imitation
propensity. In addition, we find that the roughness of the learning
trajectories, which measures the deviation from additivity of the fitness
function, is always greater than the roughness estimated over the entire

model data with a deep latent-variable model and then fit the model by
maximizing a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. VAEs can capture
complex distributions, but they can also suffer from an issue known as ""latent
variable collapse,"" especially if the likelihood model is powerful.
Specifically, the lower bound involves an approximate posterior of the latent
variables; this posterior ""collapses"" when it is set equal to the prior, i.e.,
when the approximate posterior is independent of the data. While VAEs learn
good generative models, latent variable collapse prevents them from learning
useful representations. In this paper, we propose a simple new way to avoid
latent variable collapse by including skip connections in our generative model;
these connections enforce strong links between the latent variables and the
likelihood function. We study generative skip models both theoretically and
empirically. Theoretically, we prove that skip models increase the mutual
information between the observations and the inferred latent variables.
Empirically, we study images (MNIST and Omniglot) and text (Yahoo). Compared to
existing VAE architectures, we show that generative skip models maintain
similar predictive performance but lead to less collapse and provide more
meaningful representations of the data.

segmentation techniques to extract the actor and subsequently detect
actor-environment contacts based on the estimated trajectories. For each such

initial motion segment for the manipulated object by clustering trajectories in
the contact area vicinity and then we jointly refine the object segment and
estimate its 6DOF pose in all observed frames. Because of its generality and

configure system dependencies and to provision local and remote instances.
Practitioners consider IaC as a fundamental pillar to implement DevOps
practices, which helps them to rapidly deliver software and services to
end-users. Information technology (IT) organizations, such as Github, Mozilla,
Facebook, Google and Netflix have adopted IaC. A systematic mapping study on
existing IaC research can help researchers to identify potential research areas
related to IaC, for example, the areas of defects and security flaws that may
occur in IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper is to help
researchers identify research areas related to infrastructure as code (IaC) by
conducting a systematic mapping study of IaC-related research. Methodology: We
conduct our research study by searching six scholar databases. We collect a set
of 33,887 publications by using seven search strings. By systematically
applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identify 31 publications related
to IaC. We identify topics addressed in these publications by applying
qualitative analysis. Results: We identify four topics studied in IaC-related
publications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) use of
infrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as
code; and (iv) testing in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis,
52% of the studied 31 publications propose a framework or tool to implement the
practice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC tool.
Conclusion: As defects and security flaws can have serious consequences for the
deployment and development environments in DevOps, along with other topics, we
observe the need for research studies that will study defects and security
flaws for IaC.

The astrometry and flux scale accuracy of our source catalog is investigated.
The resolution bias, incompleteness and other systematic effects that could
affect our source counts are discussed and accounted for. The derived 150 MHz
source counts present a flattening below sub-mJy flux densities, that is in
agreement with previous results from high- and low- frequency surveys. This
flattening has been argued to be due to an increasing contribution of
star-forming galaxies and faint active galactic nuclei. Additionally, we use
our observations to evaluate the contribution of cosmic variance to the scatter
in source counts measurements. The latter is achieved by dividing our Bo\""otes
mosaic into 10 non-overlapping circular sectors, each one with an approximate
area of $2\:\textrm{deg}^{2}.$ The counts in each sector are computed in the
same way as done for the entire mosaic. By comparing the induced scatter with
that of counts obtained from depth observations scaled to 150MHz, we find that
the $1\sigma$ scatter due to cosmic variance is larger than the Poissonian
errors of the source counts, and it may explain the dispersion from previously
reported depth source counts at flux densities $S<1\,\textrm{mJy}$. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of achieving deep radio imaging at low-frequencies

dense state of the matter known as the quark gluon plasma (QGP). A huge amount
of sub-nucleonic particles are created in the collision processes and their
interaction and subsequent evolution after the collision takes place is at the
core of the understanding of the matter that builds up the Universe. It has
recently been shown that event-by-event fluctuations in the spatial
distribution between different collision events have great impact on the
particle distributions that are measured after the evolution of the created
system. Specifically, these distributions are greatly responsible for
generating the observed azimuthal anisotropy in measurements. Furthermore, the
eventual cooling and expansion of the fluctuating system can become very
complex due to lumps of energy density and temperature, which affects the
interaction of the particles that traverse the medium.
  In this configuration, heavy flavor particles play a special role, as they
are generally created at the initial stages of the process and have properties
that allow them to retain ""memory"" from the interactions within the whole
evolution of the system. However, the comparison between experimental data and
theoretical or phenomenological predictions on the heavy flavor sector cannot
fully explain the heavy quarks coupling with the medium and their subsequent

depth, which is given by the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the planet and
star. However, if a star has dark starspots (or bright regions) distributed
throughout the transit chord, the transit depth will be biased towards smaller
(larger) values, and thus the inferred planet radius will be smaller (larger)
if unaccounted for. We reparameterize the transit light curve to account for
""self-contamination"" by photospheric inhomogeneities by splitting the parameter
$R_p/R_\star$ into two parameters: one for the radius ratio -- which controls
the duration of ingress and egress -- and another which measures the possibly
contaminated transit depth. We show that this is equivalent to the formulation
for contamination by a second star (with positive or negative flux), and that
it is sensitive to time-steady inhomogeneity of the stellar photosphere. We use
synthetic light curves of spotted stars at high signal-to-noise to show that
the radius recovered from measurement of the ingress/egress duration can
recover the true radii of planets transiting spotted stars with axisymmetric
spot distributions if the limb-darkening parameters are precisely known. We fit
time-averaged high signal-to-noise transit light curves from Kepler and Spitzer
of ten planets to measure the planet radii and search for evidence of spot
distributions. We find that this sample has a range of measured depths and
ingress durations which are self-consistent, providing no strong evidence for
contamination by spots. However, there is suggestive evidence for occultation
of starspots on Kepler-17, and that relatively bright regions are occulted by
the planets of Kepler-412 and HD 80606. Future observations with the James Webb
Space Telescope may enable this technique to yield accurate planetary radii in
the presence of stellar inhomogeneities.

without multi-turn wakes and without electron clouds and other beams, only one
transverse collective instability is possible, the mode-coupling instability,
or TMCI. For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold
of the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC
tune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different
methods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at
strong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles. Thus, were it
correct, such a beam with sufficiently strong SC, being stable at some
intensity, would remain stable at higher intensity, regardless of how much
higher! This paper suggests a resolution of this conundrum: while SC suppresses
TMCI, it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications, which could make
the beam even less stable than without SC, even if all the coherent tunes are
real, i.e. all the modes are stable in the conventional {\it absolute} meaning
of the word. This is done using an effective new method of analysis of the
beam's transverse spectrum for arbitrary space charge and wake fields. Two new
types of beam instabilities are introduced: the {\it saturating convective

algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from
the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is
modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of unsafe system states.The
technical condition of interest that is necessary and sufficient in this

superconducting film can be increased by a thin superconducting or normal
overlayer. For instance, deposition of a highly conductive thin overlayer onto
a dirty superconducting film can give rise to an ""anti-proximity effect"" which
manifests itself in an initial increase of $T_r(d_2)$ with the overlayer
thickness $d_2$ followed by a decrease of $T_r(d_2)$ at larger $d_2$. Such a
nonmonotonic thickness dependence of $T_r(d_2)$ results from the interplay of
the increase of a net superfluid density mitigating phase fluctuations and the
suppression of the critical temperature $T_c$ due to the conventional proximity
effect. This behavior of $T_r(d_2)$ is obtained by solving the Usadel equations
to calculate the temperature of the Berezinskii-Kosterletz-Thouless transition,
and the temperature of the resistive transition due to thermally-activated
hopping of single vortices in dirty bilayers. The theory incorporates relevant
materials parameters such as thicknesses and conductivities of the layers,
interface contact resistance between them and the subgap quasiparticle states
which affect both phase fluctuations and the proximity effect suppression of
$T_c$. The transition temperature $T_r$ can be optimized by tuning the
overlayer parameters, which can significantly weaken vortex fluctuations and
nearly restore the mean-field critical temperature. The calculated behavior of
$T_r(d_2)$ may explain the nonmonotonic dependence of $T_r(d_2)$ observed on
(Ag, Au, Mg, Zn)-coated Bi films, Ag-coated Ga and Pb films or NbN and NbTiN
films on AlN buffer layers. These results suggest that bilayers can be used as

avalanche photodiode array manufactured by Leonardo. It is sensitive to 0.8-2.5
$\mu$m light. Unlike other near-infrared arrays, SAPHIRA features a
user-adjustable avalanche gain, which multiplies the photon signal but has
minimal impact on the read noise. This enables the equivalent of sub-electron
read noise and therefore photon-counting performance, which has not previously
been achieved with astronomical near-infrared arrays. SAPHIRA is intended for
high clocking speeds, and we developed a new readout controller to utilize this
capability and thereby enable the high frame rates ($\sim$400 Hz for the full
frame or $\sim$1.7 kHz for a 128x128 pixel subarray). Beginning with the first
science-grade SAPHIRA detectors and continuing with later improved devices, we
deployed SAPHIRAs to the SCExAO instrument at Subaru Telescope. SCExAO is an
extreme adaptive optics instrument intended for observations of high-contrast
objects such as debris disks and extrasolar planets. While at SCExAO, we
demonstrated the ability of SAPHIRA to function as a focal-plane wavefront
sensor, and we performed extensive studies of speckle evolution. Our
demonstration of SAPHIRA's ability to wavefront sense behind pyramid optics
contributed to the decision to select a SAPHIRA detector and pyramid optics for
the facility-class Keck Planet Imager. Additionally, we utilized the high

phenomenon of superconductivity when pairing between two electrons is mediated
by phonons, and retardation effects are fully accounted for. BCS theory is
often viewed as the weak coupling limit of Eliashberg theory, in spite of a
handful of papers that have pointed out that this is not so. Here we present
very accurate numerical solutions in the weak coupling limit to complement the
existing analytical results, and demonstrate more convincingly the validity of
this limit by extending the analytical results to first order in the coupling

pulses can reduce dipolar interactions between spins of the same species in
solids. Our simulations of pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments
show that $\pi$ rotations with small ($<$~10\%) imperfections refocus
instantaneous diffusion. Here, the intractable N-body problem of interacting
dipoles is approximated by the average evolution of a single spin in a changing
mean field. These calculations agree well with experiments and do not require
powerful hardware. Our results add to past attempts to explain similar
phenomena in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Although the
fundamental physics of NMR are similar to ESR, the larger linewidths in ESR and
stronger dipolar interactions between electron spins compared to nuclear spins
preclude drawing conclusions from NMR studies alone. For bulk spins, we also
find that using XYXY results in less inflation of the deduced echo decay times
as compared to decays obtained with CPMG.

that the expected maximum distance of any $4$-wise independent random walk on a

independence is required for all of these algorithms, by constructing a
$3$-wise independent random walk with expected maximum distance
$\Omega(\sqrt{n} \lg n)$ from the origin. We prove that this bound is tight for
the first and second moment, and also extract a surprising matrix inequality
from these results.
  Next, we consider a generalization where the steps $X_i$ are $k$-wise
independent random variables with bounded $p$th moments. For general $k, p$, we
determine the (asymptotically) maximum possible $p$th moment of the supremum of
$X_1 + \dots + X_i$ over $1 \le i \le n$. We highlight the case $k = 4, p = 2$:
here, we prove that the second moment of the furthest distance traveled is
$O(\sum X_i^2)$. For this case, we only need the $X_i$'s to have bounded second
moments and do not even need the $X_i$'s to be identically distributed. This
implies an asymptotically stronger statement than Kolmogorov's maximal

analysis and prediction. AGM (Affiliation Graph Model) is one of the favorite
models for explaining the densely overlapped community structures. In this
paper, we thoroughly re-investigate the assumptions made by the AGM model on
real datasets. We find that the AGM model is not sufficient to explain several
empirical behaviors observed in popular real-world networks. To our surprise,
all our experimental results can be explained by a parameter-free hypothesis,
leading to more straightforward modeling than AGM which has many parameters.
Based on these findings, we propose a parameter-free Jaccard-based Affiliation
Graph (JAG) model which models the probability of edge as a network specific
constant times the Jaccard similarity between community sets associated with
the individuals. Our modeling is significantly simpler than AGM, and it
eliminates the need of associating a parameter, the probability value, with
each community. Furthermore, JAG model naturally explains why (and in fact
when) overlapping communities are densely connected. Based on these
observations, we propose a new community-driven friendship formation process,
which mathematically recovers the JAG model. JAG is the first model that points
towards a direct causal relationship between tight connections in the given
community with the number of overlapping communities inside it. Thus, \emph{the
most effective way to bring a community together is to form more
sub-communities within it.} The community detection algorithm based on our
modeling demonstrates a significantly simple algorithm with state-of-the-art
accuracy on six real-world network datasets compared to the existing link

predictive power. In this work, we use a cloud model that treat microphysical
processes to simulate potassium chloride (KCl) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) clouds in
the atmosphere of the super Earth GJ 1214b and how they vary as a function of
the strength of vertical mixing and the atmospheric metallicity. Microphysical
processes control the size and spatial distribution of cloud particles,
allowing for the computation of more physical cloud distributions than simpler
models. We find that the mass and opacity of KCl clouds increase with mixing
strength and metallicity, with the particle size and spatial distribution
defined by nucleation, condensation, evaporation, and transport timescales. ZnS
clouds cannot form without the presence of condensation nuclei, while
heterogeneous nucleation of ZnS on KCl reduces particle sizes compared to pure
KCl cases. In order to explain the flat transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b with
homogeneously nucleated KCl clouds, the atmospheric metallicity must be at

count-based HR definition and an energy-based HR definition. We observe a clear
dichotomy between Seyferts and radio loud galaxies when considering count-based
HR, which disappears when considering energy based HR. This, along with the
fact no correlation is observed between HR parameters and radio loudness,
implies radio loud and radio quiet AGN should not be discriminated by their HR
behavior. We provide schematic physical models to explain the observed
transition between energy defined HR states. We find Seyferts populate the

Patel and Regts, building on methods developed by Barvinok, showed that the
problem admits an FPTAS on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ as long as

approximability of the matching polynomial on bounded degree graphs. We show
that for all $\Delta\geq 3$ and all real $\gamma$ less than $-1/(4(\Delta-1))$,
the problem of approximating the value of the matching polynomial on graphs of

  We then explore whether the maximum degree parameter can be replaced by the

potentially unbounded maximum degree). We first show that this result does not

skyrmions in magnetic multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy. Most notably,
the essential role of the internal dipolar field is extensively considered with
a minimum amount of assumptions on the magnetization profiles. The
tri-dimensional structure of the multilayered skyrmions is modeled by their
radial profiles in each layer. We first compare the results of the model
against a full micromagnetic description in Cartesian coordinates. Our model
combines information on both layer-dependent size and chirality of the
skyrmions. We also provide a convenient criterion in order to characterize the
stability of skyrmions against anisotropic elongations that would break their
cylindrical symmetry, which allows to confirm the stability of the determined
solutions. Because this model is able to treat magnetization configurations
twisted through the thickness of multilayered skyrmions, it can provide
predictions on any potential hybrid chirality in skyrmions due to the interplay
of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and dipolar interactions in multilayers. We finally
apply the results of our model to the description of the current-driven
dynamics of hybrid chiral skyrmions. Using the Thiele formalism, we show that
we can predict the forces exerted on the multilayered skyrmions by vertical
spin-polarized currents, which provides a method to conform hybrid skyrmion
chiralities and spin-current injection geometries in order to optimize skyrmion
motion in multilayers, to the aim of maximizing the current-induced velocity,

$\Gamma$ of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space such that the orthogonal

orthogonal projection of $X$ onto $\Gamma^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement

marginals are different from the Gaussian in a certain metric defined in terms
of moments. The NGCA problem is to approximate the non-Gaussian subspace
$\Gamma^{\perp}$ given samples of $X$.
  Vectors in $\Gamma^{\perp}$ correspond to `interesting' directions, whereas
vectors in $\Gamma$ correspond to the directions where data is very noisy. The
most interesting applications of the NGCA model is for the case when the
magnitude of the noise is comparable to that of the true signal, a setting in
which traditional noise reduction techniques such as PCA don't apply directly.
NGCA is also related to dimension reduction and to other data analysis problems

an inverse polynomial dependence on the error parameter measuring the angle

chosen to be identical with the optical phonon energy for efficient absorption
of lattice heat. I show that in the proposed configuration, for a given optical

maximum cooling power at a given potential bias under optimal conditions
doesnot depend strongly on the optical phonon energy or the number of stages at
which the maximum cooling power is achieved, provided that the optical phonon
energy is less than $kT$. The proposed concept can also be applied to $2-D$ or

upon a vertical electric field suggests the existence of out-of-plane dipole
moments associated with atomic defect emitters, which is supported by

recently been proposed for transmutation of several long-lived fission products
(LLFPs). In the design study of a transmutation system using a deuteron primary
beam, accurate cross section data of deuteron-induced reactions on the LLFPs
are indispensable. Reliable model predictions play an important role in
completing the necessary cross section data since currently available
experimental data are very limited. Under the circumstances, we have been
developing a code system dedicated for deuteron-induced reactions, which is
called DEURACS. Aiming to predict the production cross sections of residual
nuclei, the purpose of the present work is to clarify a role of deuteron
breakup processes in deuteron-induced spallation reactions at intermediate
energies. Isotopic production cross sections of residual nuclei in the
deuteron-induced reactions on 93Zr and 107Pd at 100-200 MeV/nucleon are
analyzed using DEURACS, in which the breakup processes are explicitly taken
into account. The calculated cross sections are decomposed into individual
components corresponding to the absorption of either neutron or proton in the
incident deuteron, or the deuteron itself. The calculated cross sections
reproduced the experimental data well over a wide mass number range of residual
nuclei. From a component-by-component analysis, it was found that the
components of nucleon absorption have the significant contributions to the
production of residual nuclei. Consideration of the breakup processes is
essential to predict the production cross sections of residual nuclei in
deuteron-induced reactions. The framework of DEURACS is applicable to
deuteron-induced spallation reactions at intermediate energies.

valence nucleon. We focus on the properties of the associated Coriolis-coupling
Hamiltonian proposing the solutions based on the explicit construction of the
bases of the irreducible representations of the tetrahedral point-group on the
one-hand side and the microscopic angular-momentum and parity projection
nuclear mean-field approach on the other. It is shown that for one-particle
occupying an orbital belonging to the $E_{1/2}$ or $E_{5/2}$ irreducible
representation, the rotational spectrum splits into two sequences, the
structures analogous to those of the $K=1/2$ rotational bands in the axially
symmetric nuclei. Although the spectrum is generally more complicated for
one-particle occupying a 4-fold degenerate orbital belonging to the $G_{3/2}$
representation, an appearance of the correlated double-sequence structures
persists. The spectra of the doubly-magic tetrahedral core plus one-particle
systems can be well interpreted using the analytical solutions of the first
order Coriolis-coupling Hamiltonian. We introduce the notion of the generalized
decoupling parameters, which determine the size of the energy-splitting between
the double-sequence structures.

large field-of-view intensity mosaics and single tile sit-and-stare
high-cadence image sequences show detailed, fine-scale structure and exhibit
signatures of wave propagation, redistribution of heat, flows and fine-scale
bursts. These fine-scale bursts are present in the synthetic Doppler velocity
maps and can be interpreted as evidence for small-scale magnetic reconnection
at the loop boundary. The spectral lines reveal the different thermodynamic
structures of the loop, with the hotter lines showing the loop interior and
braiding, and the cooler lines showing the radial edges of the loop. The
synthetic observations of DL-NIRSP are found to preserve the radial expansion
and hence the loop radius can be measured accurately. The electron number
density can be estimated using the intensity ratio of the Fe~\textsc{xiii}
lines at 10747 and 10798~\AA. The estimated density from this ratio is correct
to within $\pm10\%$ during the later phases of the evolution, however it is
less accurate initially when line-of-sight density inhomogeneities contribute
to the Fe~\textsc{xiii} intensity, resulting in an overprediction of the
density by $\approx30\%$. The identified signatures are all above a
conservative estimate for instrument noise and therefore will be detectable. In
summary, we have used forward modelling to demonstrate that the coronal
off-limb mode of DKIST/DL-NIRSP will be able to detect multiple independent
signatures of a kink-unstable loop and observe small-scale transient features
including loop braiding/twisting and small-scale reconnection events occurring

models naturally predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on galactic

matter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an
excess of power (w.r.t. the standard $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below
the suppression scale. By running a suite of N-body simulations we investigate
the non-linear growth of structure in models of thermal inflation. We measure
the non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the
halo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter
fluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce
measurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\Lambda$CDM at
redshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all
redshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an
enhancement of around $\sim 20\%$ w.r.t. $\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower
halo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the
free parameter in the model. The enhancement in the halo mass function (w.r.t.
$\Lambda$CDM ) increases with redshift, reaching $\sim 40\%$ at $z=5$. We also
study the accuracy of the analytical Press-Schechter approach, using different
filters to smooth the density field, to predict halo statistics for thermal

structure present in multiple quantitative data sets is simultaneous component
analysis (SCA) model. However, it does not have any provisions when a part of
the data are binary. To this end, we propose the generalized SCA (GSCA) model,
which takes into account the distinct mathematical properties of binary and
quantitative measurements in the maximum likelihood framework. Like in the SCA
model, a common low dimensional subspace is assumed to represent the shared
information between these two distinct types of measurements. However, the GSCA
model can easily be overfitted when a rank larger than one is used, leading to
some of the estimated parameters to become very large. To achieve a low rank
solution and combat overfitting, we propose to use a concave variant of the
nuclear norm penalty. An efficient majorization algorithm is developed to fit
this model with different concave penalties. Realistic simulations (low
signal-to-noise ratio and highly imbalanced binary data) are used to evaluate
the performance of the proposed model in recovering the underlying structure.
Also, a missing value based cross validation procedure is implemented for model
selection. We illustrate the usefulness of the GSCA model for exploratory data
analysis of quantitative gene expression and binary copy number aberration

locally finite configuration of points and $B_1(x)$ denotes the unit closed
ball centred at $x$. The model is tuned by two parameters: the activity $z>0$
and the inverse temperature $\beta\ge 0$. We investigate the phase transition
of the model in the point of view of percolation theory and the liquid-gas
transition. First, considering the graph connecting points with distance
smaller than $2r>0$, we show that for any $\beta>0$, there exists
$0<\tilde{z}^a(\beta, r)<+\infty$ such that an exponential decay of
connectivity at distance $n$ occurs in the subcritical phase and a linear lower
bound of the connection at infinity holds in the supercritical case. Secondly
we study a standard liquid-gas phase transition related to the
uniqueness/non-uniqueness of Gibbs states depending on the parameters
$z,\beta$. Old results claim that a non-uniqueness regime occurs for $z=\beta$
large enough and it is conjectured that the uniqueness should hold outside such
an half line ($z=\beta\ge \beta_c>0$). We solve partially this conjecture by
showing that for $\beta$ large enough the non-uniqueness holds if and only if
$z=\beta$. We show also that this critical value $z=\beta$ corresponds to the
percolation threshold $ \tilde{z}^a(\beta, r)=\beta$ for $\beta$ large enough,
providing a straight connection between these two notions of phase transition.

results in a shrunk halo and a quenched shell gap at $N=16$. It is predicted

A subset $F \subset G$ is called irreducibly faithful if
there exists an irreducible unitary representation $\pi$ of $G$ such that
$\pi(x) \neq \mathrm{id}$ for all $x \in F \smallsetminus \{e\}$. Otherwise $F$
is called irreducibly unfaithful. Given a positive integer $n$, we say that $G$

group has $P(1)$, by a classical result of Gelfand and Raikov. Walter proved
that every group has $P(2)$. It is easy to see that some groups do not have
$P(3)$.
  We provide a complete description of the irreducibly unfaithful subsets of
size $n$ in a countable group $G$ (finite or infinite) with Property $P(n-1)$:
it turns out that such a subset is contained in a finite elementary abelian
normal subgroup of $G$ of a particular kind. We deduce a characterization of
Property $P(n)$ purely in terms of the group structure. It follows that, if a
countable group $G$ has $P(n-1)$ and does not have $P(n)$, then $n$ is the
cardinality of a projective space over a finite field.
  A group $G$ has Property $Q(n)$ if, for every subset $F \subset G$ of size at

that $\pi(x) \ne \pi(y)$ for any distinct $x, y$ in $F$. Every group has
$Q(2)$. For countable groups, it is shown that Property $Q(3)$ is equivalent to
$P(3)$, Property $Q(4)$ to $P(6)$, and Property $Q(5)$ to $P(9)$. For $m, n \ge
4$, the relation between Properties $P(m)$ and $Q(n)$ is closely related to a
well-documented open problem in additive combinatorics.

the pressure-induced transition to the commensurate periodic lattice distortion

electron-phonon coupling at a momentum wave vector $\mathbf{q}=(1/3,1/3,1)$. In
contrast, similar PLD transitions associated with charge density wave (CDW)
orderings in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) do not involve significant

as pressure usually suppresses CDW phases in related materials. Our findings,
therefore, provide new playgrounds to study the intricate mechanisms governing
the emergence of PLD in TMD-related materials.

Multi-particle distributions can therefore be expressed as products of these

The amplitudes and phases of the coefficients fluctuate from event to event,

Fourier coefficients $V_{n\Delta}(\eta_a, \eta_b)$ which is largely independent
of detector effects. AMPT model calculations of Pb-Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV are used to identify the smallest
$|\Delta\eta|$-gap necessary for the factorization assumption to hold.
Furthermore, a possible $\Delta\eta$-dependent decorrelation effect in the
simulated data is quantified using the empirical parameter $F_2^\eta$. The
decorrelation effect observed in the AMPT calculations is compared to results
by the CMS collaboration for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 2.76$

recommendation problem, although new, looks quite promising due to its positive
performances in terms of accuracy of recommendation results. In a
recommendation setting, in order to predict user ratings on unknown items a
possible configuration of a deep neural network is that of autoencoders
tipically used to produce a lower dimensionality representation of the original

structure of its neural network on the semanticsaware topology of a knowledge
graph thus providing a label for neurons in the hidden layer that are
eventually used to build a user profile and then compute recommendations. We
show the effectiveness of KG-AUTOENCODER in terms of accuracy, diversity and
novelty by comparing with state of the art recommendation algorithms.

pockets -- local minima of the field strength, where the CR density and thus
ionization can be reduced drastically. We obtain simple analytical expressions

Hessian of the training loss. However, the curvature along the SGD trajectory
is poorly understood. An empirical investigation shows that initially SGD
visits increasingly sharp regions, reaching a maximum sharpness determined by
both the learning rate and the batch-size of SGD. When studying the SGD
dynamics in relation to the sharpest directions in this initial phase, we find
that the SGD step is large compared to the curvature and commonly fails to
minimize the loss along the sharpest directions. Furthermore, using a reduced
learning rate along these directions can improve training speed while leading
to both sharper and better generalizing solutions compared to vanilla SGD. In
summary, our analysis of the dynamics of SGD in the subspace of the sharpest

larger learning rate or smaller batch size result in wider regions visited),
the overall training speed, and the generalization ability of the final model.

Many real-life data-sets like income data, medical data need to be secured

useful statistical information about the data-set. Data obfuscation deals with
this problem of masking a data-set in such a way that the utility of the data
is maximized while minimizing the risk of the disclosure of sensitive

involves (i) data swapping and (ii) adding noise to data. While the former
masks well sacrificing the whole of correlation information, the latter gives
estimates for most of the popular statistics like mean, variance, quantiles,
correlation but fails to give an unbiased estimate of the distribution curve of
the original data. In this paper, we propose a mixed method of obfuscation
combining the above two approaches and discuss how the proposed method succeeds

the vertices, and the appearance of an ordered hypergraph $G$ in $H$ must
respect the specified order on $V(G)$. In on-line Ramsey theory, Builder
iteratively presents edges that Painter must immediately color. The $t$-color
on-line size Ramsey number $\tilde R_t (G)$ of an ordered hypergraph $G$ is the
minimum number of edges Builder needs to play (on a large ordered set of
vertices) to force Painter using $t$ colors to produce a monochromatic copy of
$G$. The monotone tight path $P_r^{(k)}$ is the ordered hypergraph with $r$
vertices whose edges are all sets of $k$ consecutive vertices.
  We obtain good bounds on $\tilde R_t (P_r^{(k)})$. Letting $m=r-k+1$ (the
number of edges in $P_r^{(k)}$), we prove $m^{t-1}/(3\sqrt t)\le\tilde R_t

height $k-2$). We prove $R/(k\lg R)\le\tilde R_t(P_r^{(k)})\le R(\lg
R)^{2+\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is any positive constant and $t(m-1)$ is
sufficiently large. Our upper bounds improve prior results when $t$ grows
faster than $m/\log m$. We also generalize our results to $\ell$-loose monotone

$d^8$, is quite different from its high spin nickel analog. Hypothetical
LaPdO$_2$, despite its $d^9$ configuration, has a paramagnetic electronic
structure very different from cuprates. On the other hand, the hypothetical
trilayer compound La$_4$Pd$_3$O$_8$ ($d^{8.67}$) is more promising in that its
paramagnetic electronic structure is very similar to that of overdoped
cuprates. But even in the $d^9$ limit (achieved by partial substitution of La

stabilized due to the less correlated nature of Pd ions. Therefore, this

testing the validity of magnetic theories for high-temperature

controllably study chains of a length up to $L=100$ spins, i.e., much larger

determination of the exponent $\beta$ which characterizes the power-law decay
of the antiferromagnetic imbalance with time; (ii) similar determination of the
exponent $\beta_\Lambda$ which characterizes the decay of a Schmidt gap in the
entanglement spectrum, (iii) machine learning with the use, as an input, of the

consideration of the larger system sizes substantially increases the estimate
for the critical disorder $W_c$ that separates the ergodic and many-body
localized regimes, compared to the values of $W_c$ in the literature. On the
ergodic side of the transition, there is a broad interval of the strength of
disorder with slow subdiffusive transport. In this regime, the exponents
$\beta$ and $\beta_\Lambda$ increase, with increasing $L$, for relatively small

X-rays, are interpreted as density depletions due to mass loss during the CME
expansion. They contain crucial information on the early evolution of CMEs low
in the corona. For 62 dimming events, characteristic parameters are derived,
statistically analyzed and compared with basic flare quantities. On average,
coronal dimmings have a size of $2.15\times10^{10}$ km$^{2}$, contain a total
unsigned magnetic flux of $1.75\times10^{21}$ Mx, and show a total brightness
decrease of $-1.91\times10^{6}$ DN, which results in a relative decrease of
$\sim$60% compared to the pre-eruption intensity level. Their main evacuation
phase lasts for $\sim$50 minutes. The dimming area, the total dimming
brightness, and the total unsigned magnetic flux show the highest correlation
with the flare SXR fluence ($c\gtrsim0.7$). Their corresponding time
derivatives, describing the dimming dynamics, strongly correlate with the GOES
flare class ($c\gtrsim 0.6$). For 60% of the events we identified core
dimmings, i.e. signatures of an erupting flux rope. They contain 20% of the
magnetic flux covering only 5% of the total dimming area. Secondary dimmings
map overlying fields that are stretched during the eruption and closed down by
magnetic reconnection, thus adding flux to the erupting flux rope via magnetic
reconnection. This interpretation is supported by the strong correlation
between the magnetic fluxes of secondary dimmings and flare reconnection fluxes
($c=0.63\pm0.08$), the balance between positive and negative magnetic fluxes
($c=0.83\pm0.04$) within the total dimmings and the fact that for strong flares

This work presents a methodology to holistically analyze the stadiums

stadiums grass heating system are developed and tested in operation.
Experiments in winter season 2014/2015 validated the strategies impacts within
the real operational setup of the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt, Germany. With
95% confidence, these experiments saved up to 66% of median daily
weather-normalized energy consumption. Extrapolated to an average heating
season, this corresponds to savings of 775 MWh and 148 t of CO2 emissions. In
winter 2015/2016 an additional predictive nighttime heating experiment targeted
lower temperatures, which increased the savings to up to 85%, equivalent to 1
GWh (197 t CO2) in an average winter. Beyond achieving significant energy
savings, the different control strategies also met the target temperature
levels to the satisfaction of the stadiums operational staff. While the case
study constitutes a significant part, the discussions dedicated to the
transferability of this work to other stadiums and other building types show
that the concepts and the approach are of general nature. Furthermore, this

incorporated into perovskite solar cells for better light absorption and charge

In turn, low-loss and chemically inert resonant silicon nanoparticles allow for
light trapping and enhancement at nanoscale, being suitable for thin film
photovoltaics. Here photocurrent and fill-factor enhancements in
meso-superstructured organometal halide perovskite solar cells, incorporating
resonant silicon nanoparticles between mesoporous TiO2 transport and active

CeIrIn5. We use a focused ion beam (FIB) to pattern crystals on the microscale,
which tailors the strain induced by differential thermal contraction into
specific areas of the device. The resulting non-uniform strain fields induce
complex patterns of superconductivity due to the strong dependence of the
transition temperature on the strength and direction of strain. Electrical
transport and magnetic imaging of devices with different geometry show that the
obtained spatial modulation of superconductivity agrees with predictions based
on finite element simulations. These results present a generic approach to
manipulating electronic order on micrometer length scales in strongly
correlated matter.

include spatial anisotropy with a modified boundary condition consistent with a
step function liquid-vapor interface. The consequences of this improvement on
dynamical predictions are quantitative but of significant magnitude and in the
direction of further speeding up dynamics and further suppressing Tg. The
theory is applied to thin films and also thick films to address new questions
for three different polymers of different dynamic fragility. Variation of the
vitrification time scale criterion over many orders of magnitude is found to
have a minor effect on changes of the film-averaged Tg relative to its bulk
value. The mobile layer length scale grows strongly with cooling and correlates
in a nearly linear manner with the effective barrier deduced from the
corresponding bulk isotropic liquid alpha relaxation time. The theory predicts
a new type of spatially inhomogeneous ""dynamic decoupling"" corresponding to an
effective factorization of the total barrier into its bulk
temperature-dependent value multiplied by a function that only depends on
location in the film. The effective decoupling exponent grows as the vapor
surface is approached. Larger reductions of the absolute value of Tg shifts in
thin polymer films are predicted for longer time vitrification criteria and
more fragile polymers. Quantitative no-fit-parameter comparisons with

diffusion equation with the input, which is on the boundary of the domain,
being the blood or breath alcohol concentration (BAC/BrAC), and the output,
also on the boundary, being the transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC). Our
approach is based on the reformulation of the underlying dynamical system in
such a way that the random parameters are treated as additional spatial

terms of a joint density, estimating the distribution is equivalent to
estimating a functional diffusivity in a multi-dimensional diffusion equation.
The resulting system is referred to as a population model, and well-established
finite dimensional approximation schemes, functional analytic based convergence
arguments, optimization techniques, and computational methods can be used to
fit it to population data and to analyze the resulting fit. Once the forward
population model has been identified or trained based on a sample from the
population, the resulting distribution can then be used to deconvolve the
BAC/BrAC input signal from the biosensor observed TAC output signal formulated
as either a quadratic programming or linear quadratic tracking problem. In
addition, our approach allows for the direct computation of corresponding
credible bands without simulation. We use our technique to estimate bivariate
normal distributions and deconvolve BAC/BrAC from TAC based on data from a
population that consists of multiple drinking episodes from a single subject
and a population consisting of single drinking episodes from multiple subjects.

down forgetting. This strategy however is biologically implausible as it
requires knowledge of the history of previously learned patterns. In this work,
we show that a purely local weight consolidation mechanism, based on estimating
energy landscape curvatures from locally available statistics, prevents pattern
interference. Exploring a local calculation of energy curvature in the
sparse-coding limit, we demonstrate that curvature-aware learning rules reduce
forgetting in the Hopfield network. We further show that this method connects
information-geometric global learning rules based on the Fisher information to
local spike-dependent rules accessible to biological neural networks. We
conjecture that, if combined with other learning procedures, it could provide a
building-block for content-aware learning strategies that use only quantities
computable in biological neural networks to attenuate pattern interference and
catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, this work clarifies how global
information-geometric structure in a learning problem can be exposed in local

between the regional amplitudes of death spikes and birth troughs there is a
power law relationship. This confirms what was already observed for the
epidemic of 1918 in the United States (Richmond et al. 2018b). In a second part
of the paper we explain how this relationship can be used for the investigation
of mass-mortality episodes in cases where direct death data are either

based on first principle calculations by Katzarov et al. (2017) and was found
to promote dislocation generation and enhance slip planarity at a bulk hydrogen
concentration of 0.1 appm; which is typical for bcc materials. The hydrogen
elastic stress produced the same behaviour, but only when the bulk
concentration was extremely high. In a microcantilever, hydrogen was found to
promote dislocation activity which lowered the flow stress and generated more
pronounced slip steps on the free surfaces. These observations are consistent
with the hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) mechanism, and it is
concluded that both the hydrogen elastic stress and hydrogen increased
dislocation mobility are viable explanations for HELP. However it is the latter
that dominates at the low concentrations typically found in bcc metals.

  Experimental Study","presented at SIGMETRICS 2018",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Main memory (DRAM) consumes as much as half of the total system power in a
computer today, resulting in a growing need to develop new DRAM architectures
and systems that consume less power. Researchers have long relied on DRAM power
models that are based off of standardized current measurements provided by
vendors, called IDD values. Unfortunately, we find that these models are highly
inaccurate, and do not reflect the actual power consumed by real DRAM devices.
  We perform the first comprehensive experimental characterization of the power
consumed by modern real-world DRAM modules. Our extensive characterization of
50 DDR3L DRAM modules from three major vendors yields four key new observations
about DRAM power consumption: (1) across all IDD values that we measure, the
current consumed by real DRAM modules varies significantly from the current
specified by the vendors; (2) DRAM power consumption strongly depends on the
data value that is read or written; (3) there is significant structural
variation, where the same banks and rows across multiple DRAM modules from the
same model consume more power than other banks or rows; and (4) over successive
process technology generations, DRAM power consumption has not decreased by as
much as vendor specifications have indicated.
  Based on our detailed analysis and characterization data, we develop the
Variation-Aware model of Memory Power Informed by Real Experiments (VAMPIRE).
We show that VAMPIRE has a mean absolute percentage error of only 6.8% compared
to actual measured DRAM power. VAMPIRE enables a wide range of studies that
were not possible using prior DRAM power models. As an example, we use VAMPIRE
to evaluate a new power-aware data encoding mechanism, which can reduce DRAM
energy consumption by an average of 12.2%. We plan to open-source both VAMPIRE
and our extensive raw data collected during our experimental characterization.

  In this paper, we investigate for the first time the discrete data-center

by the inelastic hadronuclearinteractions between the accelerated cosmic-ray
protons in the relativistic jet and the dense gasclouds in the vicinity of the

could be much smaller than that required in the conventional hadronic model

multiwavelength flare fromthe optical to gamma-ray band can be well explained
by invoking a second radiation zone in thejet at a larger distance to the SMBH.
In our model, the neutrino emission lasts a shorter time thanthe
multiwavelength flare so the neutrino event is not necessarily correlated with
the flare but it is probably accompanied by a spectrum hardening above a few

lends itself particularly well for understanding and investigating the usage of
bibliometrics in research evaluations. Such evaluations represent judgments
under uncertainty in which typically not all possible options, their

In these situations of incomplete information, candidate descriptive and
prescriptive models of human behavior are heuristics. Heuristics are simple
strategies that, by exploiting the structure of environments, can aid people to
make smart decisions. Relying on heuristics does not mean trading off accuracy
against effort: while reducing complexity, heuristics can yield better
decisions than more information-greedy procedures in many decision
environments. The prescriptive power of heuristics is documented in a
cross-disciplinary literature, cutting across medicine, crime, business,
sports, and other domains. We outline the fast-and-frugal heuristics research

learning-based methods for geometric matching concentrate more on improving
alignment quality, while we argue the importance of naturalness issue
simultaneously. To deal with this, firstly, Pearson correlation is applied to
handle large intra-class variations of features in feature matching stage.
Then, we parametrize homography transformation with 9 parameters in full
connected layer of our network, to better characterize large viewpoint
variations compared with affine transformation. Furthermore, a novel loss
function with Gaussian weights guarantees the model accuracy and efficiency in
training procedure. Finally, we provide two choices for different purposes in
geometric matching. When compositing homography with affine transformation, the
alignment accuracy improves and all lines are preserved, which results in a
more natural transformed image. When compositing homography with non-rigid
thin-plate-spline transformation, the alignment accuracy further improves.
Experimental results on Proposal Flow dataset show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of alignment accuracy and naturalness.

two independent methods: (a) by calculating the relative terminal exponential
decay time $\tau$ for the correlation function $\langle \phi(t)\phi(0)\rangle$,
and thereafter fitting the data as $\tau \sim L^{z_c}$, where $L$ is the system
size, and (b) by measuring the anomalous diffusion exponent for the order
parameter, viz., the mean-square displacement (MSD) $\langle \Delta

obtained value $c\approx 0.80$, we calculate $z_c$. For different values of the
coupling constant $\lambda$, we report that $z_c=2.17\pm0.03$ and
$z_c=2.19\pm0.03$ for the two methods respectively. Our results indicate that
$z_c$ is independent of $\lambda$, and is likely identical to that for the 2D
Ising model. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Generalised Langevin

for the Ising model and polymeric systems, consistently capture the observed

  The {\it mean isoperimetry problem}, $\mathsf{ISO}^1(G,k)$, for a weighted

robust version of the problem seeks an optimizer where the number of vertices

electronic systems. In addition to their compactness and non-volatility
features, they are characterized by computationally relevant physical
properties, such as state-dependence, non-linear conductance changes, and
intrinsic variability in both their switching threshold and conductance values,
that make them ideal devices for emulating the bio-physics of real synapses. In
this paper we present a spiking neural network architecture that supports the
use of memristive devices as synaptic elements, and propose mixed-signal
analog-digital interfacing circuits which mitigate the effect of variability in
their conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching
threshold, for implementing stochastic learning. The effect of device
variability is mitigated by using pairs of memristive devices configured in a
complementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer
circuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired
change in synaptic weight into a corresponding switching probability that is
derived from the intrinsic stochastic behavior of memristive devices. We
demonstrate the features of the CMOS circuits and apply the architecture
proposed to a standard neural network hand-written digit classification
benchmark based on the MNIST data-set. We evaluate the performance of the
approach proposed on this benchmark using behavioral-level spiking neural
network simulation, showing both the effect of the reduction in conductance
variability produced by the current-mode normalizer circuit, and the increase
in performance as a function of the number of memristive devices used in each
synapse.

exponent. We give a formula for the optimal rate presented as an infimum over
the asymptotic spectrum of LOCC conversion. A full understanding of exact
asymptotic extraction rates between pure states in the converse regime thus
depends on a full understanding of this spectrum. We present a characterisation

This leads to a full description of the spectrum and thus an explicit formula

converse error exponent. This extends the result on entanglement concentration
in [Hayashi et al, 2003], where the target state is fixed as the Bell state. In
the limit of vanishing converse error exponent the rate formula provides an

SWIs is observed ahead of the shock, suggesting an upstream energetic particle
pressure gradient. H+ SWIs lose ~85% of their energy flux across the shock and
H+ PUIs are preferentially heated. Moreover, a PUI tail is observed downstream
of the shock, such that the energy flux of all H+ PUIs is approximately six

contact pattern scheme with interdigitated Schottky and
graphene/insulator/silicon (GIS) structures is explored to experimentally
demonstrate highly sensitive G/Si photodiodes. With the proposed design, an
external quantum efficiency (EQE) of > 80 % is achieved for wavelengths ranging
from 380 to 930 nm. A maximum EQE of 98% is observed at 850 nm, where the
responsivity peaks to 635 mA/W, surpassing conventional Si p-n photodiodes.
This efficiency is attributed to the highly effective collection of charge
carriers photogenerated in Si under the GIS parts of the diodes. The
experimental data is supported by numerical simulations of the diodes. Based on
these results, a definition for the true active area in G/Si photodiodes is
proposed, which may serve towards standardization of G/Si based optoelectronic

memory uses a new flash cell design, and vertically stacks dozens of silicon
layers in a single chip. This allows 3D NAND flash memory to increase storage
density using a much less aggressive manufacturing process technology than
planar NAND flash memory. The circuit-level and structural changes in 3D NAND
flash memory significantly alter how different error sources affect the
reliability of the memory.
  In this paper, through experimental characterization of real,
state-of-the-art 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find that 3D NAND flash memory
exhibits three new error sources that were not previously observed in planar
NAND flash memory: (1) layer-to-layer process variation, where the average
error rate of each 3D-stacked layer in a chip is significantly different; (2)
early retention loss, a new phenomenon where the number of errors due to charge
leakage increases quickly within several hours after programming; and (3)
retention interference, a new phenomenon where the rate at which charge leaks
from a flash cell is dependent on the data value stored in the neighboring
cell.
  Based on our experimental results, we develop new analytical models of
layer-to-layer process variation and retention loss in 3D NAND flash memory.
Motivated by our new findings and models, we develop four new techniques to
mitigate process variation and early retention loss in 3D NAND flash memory.
These four techniques are complementary, and can be combined together to
significantly improve flash memory reliability. Compared to a state-of-the-art
baseline, our techniques, when combined, improve flash memory lifetime by
1.85x. Alternatively, if a NAND flash vendor wants to keep the lifetime of the
3D NAND flash memory device constant, our techniques reduce the storage
overhead required to hold error correction information by 78.9%.

complex control problems under uncertain disturbances. However, traditional

this paper, a novel scenario-based SMPC approach is proposed by actively
learning a data-driven uncertainty set from available data with machine
learning techniques. A systematical procedure is then proposed to further
calibrate the uncertainty set, which gives appropriate probabilistic guarantee.
The resulting data-driven uncertainty set is more compact than traditional
norm-based sets, and can help reducing conservatism of control actions.
Meanwhile, the proposed method requires less data samples than traditional
scenario-based SMPC approaches, thereby enhancing the practicability of SMPC.
Finally the optimal control problem is cast as a single-stage robust
optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by deriving the robust
counterpart problem. The feasibility and stability issue is also discussed in
detail. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a
two-mass-spring system and a building energy control problem under uncertain

noisy channel. This problem has been widely investigated in Economics, when the
communication channel is perfect. Unlike in Information Theory, both encoder

strategies accordingly. This approach radically differs from the conventional
Communication paradigm, which assumes transmitters are of two types: either
they have a common goal, or they act as opponent, e.g. jammer, eavesdropper. We
formulate a point-to-point source-channel coding problem with state
information, in which the encoder and the decoder choose their respective
encoding and decoding strategies in order to maximize their long-run utility
functions. This strategic coding problem is at the interplay between
Wyner-Ziv's scenario and the Bayesian persuasion game of Kamenica-Gentzkow. We
characterize a single-letter solution and we relate it to the previous results
by using the concavification method. This confirms the benefit of sending
encoded data bits even if the decoding process is not supervised, e.g. when the
decoder is an autonomous device. Our solution has two interesting features: it
might be optimal not to use all channel resources; the informational content
impacts the encoding process, since utility functions capture preferences on
source symbols.

In many dynamical regimes, we show that chaos is not able to disrupt the order

chaotic fashion, do not mix. This circumstance can be explained either with
energetic considerations or in terms of dynamical restrictions.

systems, one fundamental similarity is that they are essentially dynamical
systems that can learn to imitate other dynamical systems, without knowing
their governing equations. The brain is able to learn the dynamic nature of the
physical world via experience; analogously, artificial neural systems can learn
the long-term behavior of complex dynamical systems from data. Yet, precisely
how this implicit learning occurs remains unknown. Here, we draw inspiration
from human neuroscience and from reservoir computing to propose a
first-principles framework explicating putative mechanisms of implicit
learning. Specifically, we show that an arbitrary dynamical system implicitly
learns other dynamical attractors by embedding them into its own phase space
through invertible generalized synchronization. By sustaining the embedding
through fine-tuned feedback loops, the arbitrary dynamical system can imitate
the attractor dynamics it has learned. To evaluate the mechanism's relevance,
we construct several distinct neural network models that adaptively learn and
imitate multiple attractors. We observe and explain the emergence of 5 distinct
phenomena reminiscent of cognitive functions: (i) imitating a dynamical system
purely from learning the time series, (ii) learning multiple attractors by a
single system, (iii) switching among the imitations of multiple attractors,
either spontaneously or driven by external cues, (iv) filling-in missing
variables from incomplete observations of a learned dynamical system, and (v)
deciphering superimposed input from different dynamical systems. Collectively,
our findings support the notion that artificial and biological neural networks

seriously limiting data quality in many observational regimes. The problem
manifests itself as remnant images that can persist for several days after a
deep exposure. In this study, the persistence behavior of three 5.3um cutoff
H2RGs has been characterised using a low-background cryostat with LED light
sources. Persistence charge de-trapping was measured over several hours
following a wide range of exposure levels and exposure times. This data was
then analysed to yield charge trapping and de-trapping spectra which present
graphically the trap density as a function of their time constants. These
spectra show the detector behavior in a very direct way and offer a natural
metric for comparing different devices. It is hoped that the trap time constant
spectra for each detector can be used in an analysis pipeline to remove
persistence artifacts based on the recent exposure history of the detector. The
study confirmed that the charge traps responsible for persistence must be
present in the depletion region of the pixel, however, two trap populations
were revealed. One of these captures charge within milliseconds and then
releases it over many hours. The second population is less problematic with
fairly similar trapping and de-trapping time constants. Large differences in
persistence magnitude and trap spectra have been found even between devices
with near-consecutive serial numbers. Lower temperatures resulted in lower
persistence both in terms of total trapped charge and the time taken for that
charge to decay. Limiting the full-well by reducing pixel bias voltage also had
a beneficial effect. Previously proposed mitigation techniques including
""global reset de-trapping"" and ""night light"" illumination were tried but found
to be ineffective.

networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of research attention.
Most of the existing work on this topic however focuses on Rayleigh fading
channels, which represent outdoor environments. In contrast, this paper is
dedicated to analyze the performance of dual-hop relaying systems with EH over
indoor channels characterized by log-normal fading. Both half-duplex (HD) and
full-duplex (FD) relaying mechanisms are studied in this work with
decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocols. In
addition, three EH schemes are investigated, namely, time switching relaying,
power splitting relaying and ideal relaying receiver which serves as a lower
bound. The system performance is evaluated in terms of the ergodic outage
probability for which we derive accurate analytical expressions. Monte Carlo
simulations are provided throughout to validate the accuracy of our analysis.
Results reveal that, in both HD and FD scenarios, AF relaying performs only
slightly worse than DF relaying which can make the former a more efficient
solution when the processing energy cost at the DF relay is taken into account.
It is also shown that FD relaying systems can generally outperform HD relaying
schemes as long as the loop-back interference in FD is relatively small.
Furthermore, increasing the variance of the log-normal channel has shown to
deteriorate the performance in all the relaying and EH protocols considered.

approaches to find potential communication partners and discover services. In
the present work, we focus on passive discovery approaches in multi-channel
wireless networks based on overhearing periodic beacon transmissions of
neighboring devices which are otherwise agnostic to the discovery process. We
propose a family of low-complexity algorithms that generate listening schedules
guaranteed to discover all neighbors. The presented approaches simultaneously
depending on the beacon periods optimize the worst case discovery time, the
mean discovery time, and the mean number of neighbors discovered until any

technologies such as IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4. Complementing the proposed
low-complexity algorithms, we formulate the problem of computing discovery
schedules that minimize the mean discovery time for arbitrary beacon periods as
an integer linear problem. We study the performance of the proposed approaches
analytically, by means of numerical experiments, and by extensively simulating
them under realistic conditions. We observe that the generated listening
schedules significantly - by up to factor 4 for the mean discovery time, and by
up to 300% for the mean number of neighbors discovered until each point in time
- outperform the Passive Scan, a discovery approach defined in the IEEE
802.15.4 standard. Based on the gained insights, we discuss how the selection
of the beacon periods influences the efficiency of the discovery process, and
provide recommendations for the design of systems and protocols.

yield multisensory interaction as the interplay between exogenous stimuli and
endogenous expectations. While the interaction of multisensory cues according
to their spatiotemporal properties and the formation of multisensory
feature-based representations have been widely studied, the interaction of
spatial-associative neural representations has received considerably less
attention. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that models
the interaction of spatial-associative representations to perform causal
inference of audiovisual stimuli. We investigate the spatial alignment of
exogenous audiovisual stimuli modulated by associative congruence. In the
spatial layer, topographically arranged networks account for the interaction of
audiovisual input in terms of population codes. In the associative layer,
congruent audiovisual representations are obtained via the experience-driven
development of feature-based associations. Levels of congruency are obtained as
a by-product of the neurodynamics of self-organizing networks, where the amount
of neural activation triggered by the input can be expressed via a nonlinear
distance function. Our novel proposal is that activity-driven levels of
congruency can be used as top-down modulatory projections to spatially
distributed representations of sensory input, e.g. semantically related
audiovisual pairs will yield a higher level of integration than unrelated
pairs. Furthermore, levels of neural response in unimodal layers may be seen as
sensory reliability for the dynamic weighting of crossmodal cues. We describe a
series of planned experiments to validate our model in the tasks of
multisensory interaction on the basis of semantic congruence and unimodal cue
reliability.

but have never been observed yet even though many searches have been designed
to find them at the LHC. After an introduction about the SM and the LHC, we
present the main properties of these XQs and a model independent
parametrisation that can be used to describe their phenomenology with generic
hypotheses about their mixing with SM quarks, both in the case of XQ coupling
with SM bosons and with Dark Matter (DM) candidates. In these cases we study
the offshellness effects in pair-production and decay and show that if the
Narrow-Width Approximation (NWA) is a good approximation of the full result in
the small width over mass ratio limit, sizeable differences occur when the XQ
width becomes larger. The conclusion of our analysis is that even though the
small width assumption is always conservative it is not possible to trivially
rescale the mass bounds obtained considering processes of pair production and
decay in the NWA to determine constraints for XQs with large widths. We also
study the role of interference in the process of pair production of new heavy
XQs decaying to SM particles and show that in the NWA the interference
contribution can be described by considering a parameter which contains only
the relevant couplings and the scalar part of the propagators of the new
quarks, both at the cross section level and at the distribution level. Finally,
we study how various SUSY searches perform for our simplified model with XQs
decaying to DM. We show that the bound for XQs can be obtained from the SUSY
ones just by rescaling the exclusion with the XQ cross section.

retardation effects of electrical fields on the single and double
$\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratios in three heavy-ion reactions with an isospin- and
momentum-dependent transport model IBUU11. With the beam energy increasing from
200 to 400 MeV/nucleon, effects of the relativistically retarded electrical
fields on the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio are found to increase gradually from
negligibly to considerably significant as expectedly; it is however, the
interesting observation is the relativistic retardation effects of electrical
fields on the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio are becoming gradually insignificant as
the beam energy further increasing from 400 to 800 MeV/nucleon. Moreover, we
also investigate the isospin dependence of relativistic retardation effects of
electrical fields on the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio in two isobar reaction systems
of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr at the beam energies from 200 to
800 MeV/nucleon. It is shown that the relativistic retardation effects of
electrical fields on the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio are independent of the isospin
of reaction. Furthermore, we also examine the double $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio in
reactions of $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr over $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru at the beam energies
from 200 to 800 MeV/nucleon with the static field and retarded field,
respectively. It is shown the double $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio from two reactions
is still an effective observable of symmetry energy without the interference of
electrical field due to using the relativistic calculation compared to the
nonrelativistic calculation.

periodically broadcast CAM messages \cite{b2}. A crucial aspect is to ensure
that vehicles in the same cluster will broadcast in orthogonal time
subchannels\footnote{A subchannel is a time-frequency resource chunk capable of
sufficiently conveying a CAM message.} to avoid conflicts. In general,
resource/subchannel allocation problems can be represented as weighted
bipartite graphs. However, in this scenario there is an additional time
orthogonality constraint which cannot be straightforwardly handled by
conventional graph matching methods \cite{b3}. Thus, in our approach the
mentioned constraint has been taken into account. We also perform the
allocation task in a sequential manner based on the constrainedness of each

overlapping clusters where a conflict between vehicles $V_8$ and $V_{10}$ is
generated as the allotted subchannels are in the same subframe.

variety, velocity, and veracity of data. Visualization tools are essential for
helping this human-computer interaction. For example, analytical tools that use
graphical linknode visualization can help sift through vast amounts of
information. However, assisting the analyst in making connections with visual
tools can be challenging if the information is not presented in an intuitive

  Experimentally, it has been shown that analysts increase the number of
hypotheses formed if they use visual analytic capabilities. Exploring multiple
perspectives could increase the diversity of those hypotheses, potentially
minimizing cognitive biases. In this paper, we discuss preliminary research
results that indicate an improvement in sensemaking over the traditional
link-node visualization tools by incorporating an annotation enhancement that
differentiates links connecting nodes. This enhancement assists by providing a
visual cue, which represents the perceived value of reported information. We
conclude that this improved sensemaking occurs because of the removal of the

electrodynamics, which features a topological magnetoelectric term in the
Maxwell equations. As a consequence magnetic fields become the source of
electric fields and vice-versa, a phenomenon that is general for any material
exhibiting a linear magnetoelectric effect. Axion electrodynamics has been
associated with the possibility to create magnetic monopoles, in particular by
an electrical charge that is screened above the surface of a magnetoelectric
material. Here we explicitly solve for the electromagnetic fields in this
geometry and show that while vortex-like magnetic screening fields are
generated by the electrical charge their divergence is identically zero at
every point in space which implies an absence of induced magnetic monopoles.
Nevertheless magnetic image charges can be made explicit in the problem and
even if no bound state with electric charges yielding a dyon arises, a
dyon-like angular momentum follows from our analysis. Because of its dependence
on the dielectric constant this angular momentum is not quantized, which is
consistent with a general argument that precludes magnetic monopoles to be
generated in Maxwell magnetoelectrics. We also solve for topologically
protected zero modes in the Dirac equation induced by the point charge. Since
