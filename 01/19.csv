model fitting. These methods require data with good signal-to-noise ratio and
reliable continuum normalisation. This is particularly challenging for the
spectra we have obtained with the CORALIE \'{e}chelle spectrograph for FGK
stars with transiting M-dwarf companions. The spectra tend to have low
signal-to-noise ratios, which makes it difficult to analyse them using existing
methods. Our aim is to create a reliable automated spectral analysis routine to
determine $T_{\rm eff}$, [Fe/H], $V \sin i$ from the CORALIE spectra of FGK
stars. We use wavelet decomposition to distinguish between noise, continuum
trends, and stellar spectral features in the CORALIE spectra. A subset of
wavelet coefficients from the target spectrum are compared to those from a grid
of models in a Bayesian framework to determine the posterior probability
distributions of the atmospheric parameters. By testing our method using
synthetic spectra we found that our method converges on the best fitting
atmospheric parameters. We test the wavelet method on 20 FGK exoplanet host
stars for which higher quality data have been independently analysed using
equivalent width measurements. We find that we can determine $T_{\rm eff}$ to a
precision of $85$K, [Fe/H] to a precision of 0.06 dex and $V \sin i$ to a
precision of 1.35 kms$^{-1}$ for stars with $V \sin i$ $\geq$ 5 kms$^{-1}$. We
find an offset in metallicity $\approx -$0.18 dex relative to the equivelent
width fitting method. We can determine $\log g$ to a precision of $0.13$ dex
but measurements are only reliable to confirm dwarf-like surface gravity. The
wavelet method can be used to determine $T_{\rm eff}$, [Fe/H] and $V \sin i$
for FGK stars from \'{e}chelle spectra. We find that our method is self
consistent, and robust for spectra with SNR$\gtrapprox 40$.

about 100 Earth-sized planets that are already known to be orbiting in their
habitable zones (HZ). For a sample of G and K type hosts, most of these planets
will be between 25 and 50 milli-arcsec (mas) from their host star and 1 billion
to 10 billion times fainter. To separate the planet's image from that of its
host star at the wavelength (763nm) of the oxygen biosignature we need a
telescope with an aperture of 16 metres. Furthermore, the intensity of the
light from the host star at the position in the image of the exoplanet must be
suppressed otherwise the exoplanet will be lost in the glare.
  This presents huge technical challenges. The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent
which makes it impossible to achieve the required contrast from the ground at
763nm. The telescope therefore needs to be in space and to fit the telescope in
the rocket fairing it must be a factor of 4 or more times smaller when folded
than when operational. To obtain spectroscopy of the planet's biosignature at
763nm we need to use an integral field spectrometer (IFS) with a field of view
(FOV) of 1000 x 1000 milli-arcsec (mas) and a spectral resolution of 100. This
is a device that simultaneously takes many pictures of the exoplanet each at a
slightly different wavelength which are then recorded as a data cube with two
spatial dimensions and one wavelength dimension. In every data cube wavelength
slice, the background light from the host star at the location of the planet
image must be minimised. This is achieved via a coronagraph which blocks the
light from the host star and active/adaptive optics techniques which
continuously maintain very high accuracy optical alignment to make the images
as sharp as possible. These are the technical challenges to be addressed in a
design study.

in the literature, generates a too soft, too long, and too bright prompt
emission. Off-axis view of an structured jet with a Lorentz factor of about 10
can reproduce observations, but needs a very efficient transfer of kinetic
energy to electrons in internal shocks, which is disfavored by particle in cell
simulations. We also comment on cocoon breakout as a mechanism for generation
of the prompt gamma-ray. A relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of about 100
and a density lower than typical short GRBs seems to be the most plausible
model and we conclude that GRB 170817A was intrinsically faint. Based on this
result and findings of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BNS
merger in the literature we discuss physical and astronomical conditions, which
may lead to such faint short GRBs. We identify small mass difference of
progenitor neutron stars, their old age and reduced magnetic field, and
anti-alignment of spin-orbit angular momentum induced by environmental
gravitational disturbances during the lifetime of the BNS as causes for the
faintness of GRB 170817A. We predict that BNS mergers at lower redshifts
generate on average fainter GRBs.

by considering a reduced model of the associated fluid-structure interaction

cheap. This goal is achieved by means of two levels of reduction: first, we
describe the model equations with a reduced mathematical formulation which
allows to write the fluid-structure interaction problem as a Navier-Stokes
system with non-standard boundary conditions; second, we employ numerical
reduction techniques to further and drastically lower the computational costs.
The numerical reduction is obtained coupling two well-known techniques: the
proper orthogonal decomposition and the reduced basis method, in particular the
greedy algorithm. We start by reducing the numerical dimension of the problem
at hand with a proper orthogonal decomposition and we measure the system energy
with specific norms; this allows to take into account the different orders of
magnitude of the state variables, the velocity and the pressure. Then, we
introduce a strategy based on a greedy procedure which aims at enriching the
reduced discretization space with low offline computational costs. As
application, we consider a realistic haemodynamics problem with a perturbation

segregation of the genetic material into the two daughter cells. In the
bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the
chromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively
regulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of
the cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has
remained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical
parameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ to the nucleoid and the
cluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ dimers
interacting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these
questions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid,
the Pom cluster and the PomZ protein. We find that a mechanism based on the
diffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter's
midnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an
ATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach
midnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ dimers on the nucleoid is slow relative to
the cluster's velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around
midnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a
semi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its
components: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side,
the force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective
friction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom
cluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the
nucleoid is reduced. A similar approach to that applied here may also prove
useful for cargo localization in ParABS systems.

Bayesian optimization. Nonetheless, Gaussian processes suffer two significant
drawbacks: outliers are a priori assumed unlikely, and the posterior variance
conditioned on observed data depends only on the locations of those data, not
the associated sample values. Student's-T processes are a generalization of
Gaussian processes, founded on the Student's-T distribution instead of the
Gaussian distribution. Student's-T processes maintain the primary advantages of
Gaussian processes (kernel function, analytic update rule) with additional
benefits beyond Gaussian processes. The Student's-T distribution has higher
Kurtosis than a Gaussian distribution and so outliers are much more likely, and
the posterior variance increases or decreases depending on the variance of
observed data sample values. Here, we describe Student's-T processes, and
discuss their advantages in the context of aerospace optimization. We show how
to construct a Student's-T process using a kernel function and how to update
the process given new samples. We provide a clear derivation of
optimization-relevant quantities such as expected improvement, and contrast
with the related computations for Gaussian processes. Finally, we compare the
performance of Student's-T processes against Gaussian process on canonical test
problems in Bayesian optimization, and apply the Student's-T process to the

a function of particle overlap, yet the model assumes that the disks remain

however, the packing fraction is fixed at $\phi=1$. Here, we describe the
deformable particle model (DPM), where each particle is a polygon composed of a
large number of vertices. The total energy includes three terms: two quadratic
terms to penalize deviations from the preferred particle area $a_0$ and
perimeter $p_0$ and a repulsive interaction between DPM polygons that penalizes
overlaps. We performed simulations to study the onset of jamming in packings of
DPM polygons as a function of asphericity, ${\cal A} = p_0^2/4\pi a_0$. We show
that the packing fraction at jamming onset $\phi_J({\cal A})$ grows with
increasing ${\cal A}$, reaching confluence at ${\cal A} \approx 1.16$. ${\cal
A}^*$ corresponds to the value at which DPM polygons completely fill the cells
obtained from a surface-Voronoi tessellation. Further, we show that DPM
polygons develop invaginations for ${\cal A} > {\cal A}^*$ with excess
perimeter that grows linearly with ${\cal A}-{\cal A}^*$. We confirm that
packings of DPM polygons are solid-like over the full range of ${\cal A}$ by

disks in the nearby star forming regions, and it is not possible to derive
reliable statistics that can be compared with exoplanet populations. We present
the analysis of 11 transition disks with large cavities (>20 AU radius) from a

disks of large cavities within a complete disk survey within a star forming

gas cavity is resolved as well. The deep drops in gas density and large dust
cavity sizes are consistent with clearing by giant planets. The fraction of
transition disks with large cavities in Lupus is ~11%, which is inconsistent
with exoplanet population studies of giant planets at wide orbits. Furthermore,
we present a hypothesis of an evolutionary path for large massive disks
evolving into transition disks with large cavities.

V, Mn, Cu, and Zn in individual stars of five bulge globular clusters (NGC

the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope over the years. The sample
globular clusters studied span metallicities in the range -1.2<Fe/H]<0.0. V and
Sc appear to vary in lockstep with Fe, indicating that they are produced in the
same supernovae as Fe. We find that Mn is deficient in metal-poor stars,
confirming that it is underproduced in massive stars; Mn-over-Fe steadily
increases at the higher metallicities due to a metallicity-dependent enrichment
by supernovae of type Ia. Cu behaves as a secondary element, indicating its
production in a weak-s process in massive stars. Zn has an alpha-like behaviour
at low metallicities, which can be explained in terms of nucleosynthesis in
hypernovae. At the metal-rich end, Zn decreases with increasing metallicity,
similarly to the alpha-elements.

perspective of the local distribution of pore occupancies, along with the

show that the widely accepted approach, in which the contributions to the free
energy given by the molecules located in two neighboring pores are estimated
through Monte Carlo simulations where the two pores are kept separated from the
rest of the system, leads to inaccurate results at high sorbate densities. In
the coarse-graining strategy that we propose, which is based on the
Bethe-Peierls approximation, density-independent interaction terms are instead
computed according to local effective potentials that take into account the
correlations between the pore pair and its surroundings by means of mean-field
correction terms, without the need of simulating the pore pair separately. Use
of the interaction parameters obtained this way allows the coarse-grained
system to reproduce more closely the equilibrium properties of the original
one. Results are shown for lattice-gases where the local free energy can be
computed exactly, and for a system of Lennard-Jones particles under the effect
of a static confining field.

evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic
rays on an intermediate angular scale, which is indicative of excess arrivals
from strong, nearby sources. The data consist of 5514 events above 20 EeV with
zenith angles up to 80 deg recorded before 2017 April 30. Sky models have been
created for two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters:
active galactic nuclei from the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL)
and starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined with Fermi-LAT.
Flux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BAT
and 2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model of
cosmic-ray density constructed using each catalog has two free parameters, the
fraction of events correlating with astrophysical objects and an angular scale
characterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic sources. A
maximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of these
parameters and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast with
isotropy. It is found that the starburst model fits the data better than the
hypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0 sigma, the
highest value of the test statistic being for energies above 39 EeV. The three
alternative models are favored against isotropy with 2.7-3.2 sigma
significance. The origin of the indicated deviation from isotropy is examined
and prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.

Twitter topics from their birth through lifecycle to death, has gained immense
mainstream research popularity. In the literature, topics are often treated as
one of (a) hashtags (independent from other hashtags), (b) a burst of keywords
in a short time span or (c) a latent concept space captured by advanced text
analysis methodologies, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The first
two approaches are not capable of recognizing topics where different users use
different hashtags to express the same concept (semantically related), while
the third approach misses out the user's explicit intent expressed via
hashtags. In our work, we use a word embedding based approach to cluster
different hashtags together, and the temporal concurrency of the hashtag
usages, thus forming topics (a semantically and temporally related group of
hashtags).We present a novel analysis of topic lifecycles with respect to
communities. We characterize the participation of social communities in the
topic clusters, and analyze the lifecycle of topic clusters with respect to
such participation. We derive first-of-its-kind novel insights with respect to
the complex evolution of topics over communities and time: temporal morphing of
topics over hashtags within communities, how the hashtags die in some
communities but morph into some other hashtags in some other communities (that,
it is a community-level phenomenon), and how specific communities adopt to
specific hashtags. Our work is fundamental in the space of topic lifecycle
modeling and understanding in communities: it redefines our understanding of
topic lifecycles and shows that the social boundaries of topic lifecycles are
deeply ingrained with community behavior.

length, the existence of this regime is still debated. To help address this, we
have applied finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) to
study the thermodynamics of the superfluid phase transition and signatures of
the pseudogap in the spin-balanced homogeneous unitary Fermi gas. We present
results at finite filling factor $\nu \simeq 0.06$ for the condensate fraction,
an energy-staggering pairing gap, the spin susceptibility, and the heat
capacity, and compare them to experimental data when available. In contrast to
previous AFMC simulations, our model space consists of the complete first
Brillouin zone of the lattice, and our calculations are performed in the
canonical ensemble of fixed particle number. The canonical ensemble AFMC
framework enables the calculation of a model-independent gap, providing direct
information on pairing correlations without the need for numerical analytic
continuation. We use finite-size scaling to estimate $T_c$ at the corresponding
filling factor. We find that the energy-staggering pairing gap vanishes above
$T_c$, showing no pseudogap effects, and that the spin susceptibility shows a
substantially reduced signature of a spin gap compared to previously reported

that the change in the temporal evolution of the light curve is due to the

interpret all the existing afterglow data with two models: i) a structured jet

the canonical boson sampling scenario in which an $n$-particle Fock input state
propagates through a linear-optical network and is subsequently measured by
particle-number detectors in the $m$ output modes. We examine two models of
losses. In the first model a fixed number of particles is lost. We prove that
in this scenario the output statistics can be well approximated by an efficient
classical simulation, provided that the number of photons that is left grows
slower than $\sqrt{n}$. In the second loss model, every time a photon passes
through a beamsplitter in the network, it has some probability of being lost.
For this model the relevant parameter is $s$, the smallest number of
beamsplitters that any photon traverses as it propagates through the network.
We prove that it is possible to approximately simulate the output statistics
already if $s$ grows logarithmically with $m$, regardless of the geometry of
the network. The latter result is obtained by proving that it is always
possible to commute $s$ layers of uniform losses to the input of the network
regardless of its geometry, which could be a result of independent interest. We
believe that our findings put strong limitations on future experimental
realizations of quantum computational supremacy proposals based on boson
sampling.

fraction $\mu_n$ (of its choice) of the traffic exchanged between the $n$th
database and the user. In addition to the privacy constraint, the databases
should encode the returned answer strings such that the eavesdropper learns
absolutely nothing about the \emph{contents} of the databases. We aim at
characterizing the capacity of the PIR-WTC-II under the combined privacy and
security constraints. We obtain a general upper bound for the problem in the
form of a max-min optimization problem, which extends the converse proof of the
PIR problem under asymmetric traffic constraints. We propose an achievability
scheme that satisfies the security constraint by encoding a secret key, which
is generated securely at each database, into an artificial noise vector using
an MDS code. The user and the databases operate at one of the corner points of
the achievable scheme for the PIR under asymmetric traffic constraints such
that the retrieval rate is maximized under the imposed security constraint. The

and strong-coupling limit, a heavy Fermi liquid is formed. The critical
Fermi-surface in the non-Fermi liquid regime gives rise to quantum oscillations
in the magnetization as a function of an external magnetic field in the absence
of quasiparticle excitations. We discuss the implications of these results for
local quantum criticality and for fundamental bounds on relaxation rates.
Drawing on the lessons from these models, we formulate conjectures on coarse
grained descriptions of a class of intermediate scale non-fermi liquid behavior
in generic correlated metals.

amount of metals: the circum-galactic medium (CGM). The CGM acts as a mediator
between the galaxy and the extra-galactic medium. However, our understanding of
how galaxy mergers, a major evolutionary transformation, impact the CGM remains
deficient. We present a theoretical study of the effect of galaxy mergers on
the CGM. We use hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations of a major
merger selected from the Illustris project such that the z=0 descendant has a
halo mass and stellar mass comparable to the Milky Way. To study the CGM we
then re-simulated this system at a 40 times better mass resolution, and
included detailed post-processing ionization modelling. Our work demonstrates
the effect the merger has on the characteristic size of the CGM, its
metallicity, and the predicted covering fraction of various commonly observed
gas-phase species, such as H I, C IV, and O VI. We show that merger-induced
outflows can increase the CGM metallicity by 0.2-0.3 dex within 0.5 Gyr
post-merger. These effects last up to 6 Gyr post-merger. While the merger
increases the total metal covering fractions by factors of 2-3, the covering
fractions of commonly observed UV ions decrease due to the hard ionizing
radiation from the active galactic nucleus, which we model explicitly. Our
study of the single simulated major merger presented in this work demonstrates
the significant impact that a galaxy interaction can have on the size,
metallicity, and observed column densities of the CGM.

prevent newly formed giant planets from growing larger than 10 M_Jup,
protoplanetary disks must therefore be significantly less viscous or of lower

and verified with an extensive set of 2D axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations, we have estimated a threshold intrinsic jet luminosity, $L_{\rm

structure of the progenitor and, thus, it is sensible to its mass and to its
metallicity. For a prototype host of cosmological long GRBs, a low-metallicity
star of 35$\,M_{\odot}$, it is $L_{\rm j}^{\rm thr} \simeq 1.35\times

jet luminosity into $\gamma$-radiation, $\epsilon_\gamma$. Highly energetic
jets can produce low-luminosity events if either their opening angle after the
breakout is large, which is found in our models, or if the conversion
efficiency of kinetic and internal energy into radiation is low enough. Beyond
this theoretical analysis, we show how the presence of a SN shock wave may
reduce this luminosity threshold by means of numerical simulations. We foresee
that the high-energy transients released by jets produced near the luminosity

all galaxy mergers occur prior to $z\sim3$, meaning that accreted stellar

mergers in their lifetimes, with typical pre-merger galaxy mass ratios that are
less than 1:10. This merger frequency is generally comparable to what has been
found in dissipationless simulations when coupled with abundance matching. Two
of the simulated dwarfs have a luminous satellite companion at $z=0$. These
ultra-faint dwarfs lie at or below current detectability thresholds but are
intriguing targets for next-generation facilities. The small contribution of
accreted stars make it extremely difficult to discern the effects of mergers in
the vast majority of dwarfs either photometrically or using resolved-star
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The important implication for near-field
cosmology is that star formation histories of comparably massive galaxies
derived from resolved CMDs should trace the build-up of stellar mass in one
main system across cosmic time as opposed to reflecting the contributions of
many individual star formation histories of merged dwarfs.

The $59.9\pm6.2\,R_\odot$ disk around the accreting star occults the donor star
once every orbit, inducing 19 day long, 7% deep eclipses identified by K2, and
subsequently found in pre-discovery ASAS and ASAS-SN observations. We
coordinated a campaign of photometric and spectroscopic observations for MWC
882 to measure the dynamical masses of the components and to monitor the system
during eclipse. We found the photometric eclipse to be gray to $\approx 1$%. We
found the primary star exhibits spectroscopic signatures of active accretion,
and observed gas absorption features from the disk during eclipse. We suggest
MWC 882 initially consisted of a $\approx 3.6\,M_\odot$ donor star transferring
mass via Roche lobe overflow to a $\approx 2.1\,M_\odot$ accretor in a $\approx
7$ day initial orbit. Through angular momentum conservation, the donor star is
pushed outward during mass transfer to its current orbit of 72 days. The
observed state of the system corresponds with the donor star having left the
Red Giant Branch ~0.3 Myr ago, terminating active mass transfer. The present
disk is expected to be short-lived ($10^2$ years) without an active feeding
mechanism, presenting a challenge to this model.

SMBHB candidates was identified as bright periodically variable quasars in
optical surveys. If the observed periodicity corresponds to the redshifted
binary orbital period, the inferred orbital velocities are relativistic
(v/c~0.1). The optical and UV luminosities are expected to arise from gas bound
to the individual BHs, and would be modulated by the relativistic Doppler
effect. The optical and UV light curves should vary in tandem with relative
amplitudes which depend on the respective spectral slopes. We constructed a
control sample of 42 quasars with aperiodic variability, to test whether this
Doppler colour signature can be distinguished from intrinsic chromatic
variability. We found that the Doppler signature can arise by chance in ~20%
(~37%) of quasars in the nUV (fUV) band. These probabilities reflect the
limited quality of the control sample and represent upper limits on how
frequently quasars mimic the Doppler brightness+colour variations. We performed
separate tests on the periodic quasar candidates, and found that for the
majority, the Doppler boost hypothesis requires an unusually steep UV spectrum
or an unexpectedly large BH mass and orbital velocity. We conclude that at most
~1/3rd of these periodic candidates can harbor Doppler-modulated SMBHBs.

companion and reveal that it is near the L/T transition (T1+/-2). Fitting
atmospheric models to the companion spectrum, we find strong evidence for the
presence of clouds. However, spectral models cannot satisfactorily fit the
complete data set: while the shape of the spectrum can be well-matched in
individual filters, a joint fit across the full passband results in
discrepancies that are a consequence of the inherent color of the brown dwarf.
We also find a $2\sigma$ tension in the companion mass, age, and surface
gravity when comparing to evolutionary models. These results highlight the
importance of using benchmark objects to study ""secondary effects"" such as
metallicity, non-equilibrium chemistry, cloud parameters, electron conduction,
non-adiabatic cooling, and other subtleties affecting emergent spectra. As a

ago there began a quest for how to interpret the theoretical constructs of the
formalism. In fact, the pursuit of new interpretations of quantum mechanics
persists to this day. Most of these endeavors assume the validity of standard
quantum formalism and proceed to ponder the ontic nature of wave functions,
operators, and the Sch\""{o}dinger equation. The present essay takes a different
approach, more epistemological than ontological. I endeavor to give a heuristic
account of how empirical principles lead us to a quantum mechanical description
of the world. An outcome of this approach is the suggestion that the notion of
discrete quanta leads to the wave nature and statistical behavior of matter
rather than the other way around. Finally, the hope is to offer some solace to
those older of us who still worry about such things and also to provide the
neophyte student of quantum mechanics with physical insight into the
mathematically abstract and often baffling aspects of the theory.

two of them meet, when the colliding pair annihilates instantly. The
construction of such a system of annihilating Brownian motions (aBMs) is
straightforward as long as we start with a finite number of particles, but is
more involved for infinitely many particles. In particular, if we let the set
of starting points become increasingly dense in the real line it is not obvious
whether the resulting systems of aBMs converge and what the possible limit
points (entrance laws) are. In this paper, we show that aBMs arise as the
interface model of the continuous-space voter model. This link allows us to
provide a full classification of entrance laws for aBMs. We also give some
examples showing how different entrance laws can be obtained via finite
approximations. Further, we discuss the relation of the continuous-space voter
model to the stepping stone and other related models. Finally, we obtain an

composed of communities that are constantly changing in membership. Identifying
these communities is of great importance when analyzing structural properties
of networks. Hence, recent years have witnessed intense research in of solving
the challenging problem of detecting such evolving communities. The mainstream
approach towards community detection involves optimization of a global
partition quality metric (e.g. modularity) over the network. Another technique,
Spectral Clustering, involves mapping of original data points in a lower
dimensional space, where the clustering properties of a graph are much more
evident, and then applying standard clustering techniques for identifying
communities. However, the traditional spectral clustering techniques cannot
naturally learn the number of communities in networks. These techniques are
based on external community connectivity properties, and often fail to identify
smaller community structures in dense networks. In this article, we propose an
algorithm, namely, the Cascaded Stackelberg Community Detection Algorithm
(CASCODE) inspired by the Stackelberg Duopoly Game. This algorithm uses the
notion of a leader-follower relationship between the nodes to influence the
actions of either. The intuition of the algorithm is based on the natural
expected internal structure in evolving communities in networks. Thus, the
algorithm is able to naturally learn the number of communities in a network in
contrast with other techniques such as Spectral Clustering, which require the
expected number of communities as an input. Because this Stackelberg
Model-based Community Detection algorithm detects communities through their
internal structure, we are able to obtain a finer community structure
resolution in dense networks.

brightness galaxy was first identified in the ALFALFA survey as an ""(Almost)

counterpart in existing optical survey data (although faint ultraviolet
emission was detected in archival GALEX imaging). Using a combination of data
from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array, we investigate the HI morphology and kinematics at a variety of physical
scales. The HI morphology is irregular, reaching only moderate maxima in mass
surface density (peak $\sigma_{\rm HI}\sim 10$ $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). Gas of
lower surface brightness extends to large radial distances, with the HI
diameter measured at 4.0$\pm$0.2 kpc inside the 1 $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ level.
We quantify the relationships between HI gas mass surface density and various
types of star formation by considering GALEX far ultraviolet observations and
H$\alpha$ nondetections. We describe Coma P's complex HI kinematics using
spatially resolved position-velocity analysis and three-dimensional modeling.
Both methods of analysis suggest that Coma P's kinematics show signatures of
either the collision of two HI disks or a significant infall event. Coma P is
just consistent (within 3$\sigma$) with the known M$_{\rm HI}$ -- D$_{\rm HI}$
scaling relation. It is either too large for its HI mass, has too low an HI
mass for its HI size, or the two HI components artificially extend its HI size.
Coma P lies within the empirical scatter at the faint end of the baryonic
Tully--Fisher relation, although the complexity of the HI dynamics complicates
the interpretation. The collective HI characteristics of Coma P make it unusual
among known galaxies in the nearby universe. [Abridged]

the ratio between the differential precession rate driven by the perturber and
the mutual precession rate of the inner planets. Loosely packed systems
(corresponding to $\epsilon_{12} \gg 1$) are more susceptible to
eccentricity/inclination excitations by the perturber than tightly packed inner
systems (with $\epsilon_{12} \ll 1$) (or singletons), although resonance may
occur around $\epsilon_{12}\sim 1$, leading to large $e_i$ and $\theta_{12}$.
Dynamical instability may set in for inner planet systems with large excited
eccentricities and mutual inclinations. We present a formalism to extend our
analytical results to general inner systems with $N>2$ planets and apply our

conservative to perform well on the above task. This motivates anchor
regression, a method that makes use of exogeneous variables to solve a

that the factorization of RG $\beta$-function will always be implemented in any

generated by the supersonic expansion and buoyant rise of AGN-driven bubbles.
Previous work which neglects magnetic fields has shown that this process is
inefficient, with less than 1% of the injected energy ending up in turbulence.
This inefficiency is primarily due to the fact that the bubbles are shredded
apart by hydrodynamic instabilities before they can excite sufficiently strong
g-modes. Using a plane-parallel model of the ICM and 3D ideal MHD simulations,
we examine the role of a large-scale magnetic field which is able to drape
around these rising bubbles, preserving them from hydrodynamic instabilities.
We find that, while magnetic draping appears better able to preserve AGN-driven
bubbles, the driving of g-modes and the resulting production of turbulence is
still inefficient. The magnetic tension force prevents g-modes from
transitioning into the nonlinear regime, suppressing turbulence in our model
ICM. Our work highlights the ways in which ideal MHD is an insufficient
description for the cluster feedback process, and we discuss future work such
as the inclusion of anisotropic viscosity as a means of simulating high $\beta$
plasma kinetic effects. These results suggest the hypothesis that other
mechanisms of heating the ICM plasma such as sound waves or cosmic rays may be

projected isodensity contours. These results provide guidance in the

minimum cut, and shortest path, are an active research area in distributed
computing. This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for such problems
in the CONGEST model, on networks that exclude a fixed minor.
  On general graphs, many optimization problems, including the ones mentioned
above, require $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt n)$ rounds of communication in the CONGEST
model, even if the network graph has a much smaller diameter. Naturally, the
next step in algorithm design is to design efficient algorithms which bypass
this lower bound on a restricted class of graphs. Currently, the only known
method of doing so uses the low-congestion shortcut framework of Ghaffari and
Haeupler [SODA'16]. Building off of their work, this paper proves that excluded
minor graphs admit high-quality shortcuts, leading to an $\tilde O(D^2)$ round
algorithm for the aforementioned problems, where $D$ is the diameter of the
network graph. To work with excluded minor graph families, we utilize the Graph
Structure Theorem of Robertson and Seymour. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first time the Graph Structure Theorem has been used for an algorithmic
result in the distributed setting.
  Even though the proof is involved, merely showing the existence of good
shortcuts is sufficient to obtain simple, efficient distributed algorithms. In
particular, the shortcut framework can efficiently construct near-optimal
shortcuts and then use them to solve the optimization problems. This, combined
with the very general family of excluded minor graphs, which includes most
other important graph classes, makes this result of significant interest.

and are the highest to date obtained beyond the Local Group. We use the CPROPS
algorithm to identify and characterize 250 GMCs across the observed regions.
GMCs in NGC 300 appear qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in the
Milky Way disk: they show an identical scaling relationship between size $R$
and linewidth $\Delta V$ ($\Delta V \propto R^{0.48\pm0.05}$), appear to be
mostly in virial equilibrium, and are consistent with having a constant surface
density of $60$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. The GMC mass spectrum is similar to
those in the inner disks of spiral galaxies (including the Milky Way). Our
results suggest that global galactic properties such as total stellar mass,
morphology, and average metallicity may not play a major role in setting GMC
properties, at least within the disks of galaxies on the star-forming main
sequence. Instead, GMC properties may be more strongly influenced by local
environmental factors such as the mid-plane disk pressure. In particular, in
the inner disk of NGC 300 we find this pressure to be similar to that in the
local Milky Way but markedly lower than that in the disk of M51 where GMCs are
characterized by systematically higher surface densities and a higher
coefficient for the size-linewidth relation.

shown high performance in energy absorption applications, even under high
compressive deformations. In general, foams are very effective as energy
dissipative materials and have been widely used in many areas such as
automotive, aerospace and biomedical industries. In the case of graphene-based
foams, the good mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the intrinsic
graphene and/or GO electronic and mechanical properties. Despite the attractive
physical properties of graphene/GO based-foams, their structural and thermal
stabilities are still a problem for some applications. For instance, they are
easily degraded when placed in flowing solutions, either by the collapsing of
their layers or just by structural disintegration into small pieces. Recently,
a new and scalable synthetic approach to produce low-density 3D macroscopic GO
structure interconnected with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymeric chains
(pGO) was proposed. A controlled amount of PDMS is infused into the
freeze-dried foam resulting into a very rigid structure with improved
mechanical properties, such as tensile plasticity and toughness. The PDMS wets
the graphene oxide sheets and acts like a glue bonding PDMS and GO sheets. In
order to obtain further insights on mechanisms behind the enhanced mechanical
pGO response we carried out fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Based on MD results, we build up a structural model that can
explain the experimentally observed mechanical behavior.

theories in condensed matter physics. It is justified in ordinary metal
superconductors the coherence length $\xi$ is large, with two important
features: the order parameter (OP) and excitation gap (EG) are identical, and
the pair formation and their Bose condensation take place at the same
temperature Tc. It fails to explain the underdoped cuprate superconductivity:
EG is finite at Tc and thus distinct from OP. Since these superconductors
belong to a large class of small $\xi$ materials, this failure has the
potential for widespread impact.
  Here we have extended BCS theory in a natural way to short $\xi$
superconductors, based on a BCS--BEC crossover scenario, and arrived at a
simple physical picture in which incoherent, finite momentum pairs become
progressively more important as the pairing interaction becomes stronger,
leading to the distinction between EG and OP. The superconductivity from the
fermionic perspective and BEC from the bosonic perspective are just two sides
of the same coin.
  Our theory is capable of making verifiable quantitative predictions. We
obtain a cuprate phase diagram (with one free parameter) , in
(semi-)quantitative agreement with experiment. The mutually compensating
contributions from fermionic quasiparticles and bosonic pair excitations
provides a natural explanation for the quasi-universal behavior of the in-plane
superfluid density versus T. Our bosonic pair excitations also provide an
intrinsic mechanism for the long mysterious linear T terms in the specific
heat. Incoherent pair contributions lead to new low T power laws, consistent
with existing experiments. Finally, we demonstrated that the onset of
superconducting long range order leads to sharp features in the specific heat
at Tc, consistent with experiment.

a high dynamic range (HDR) image from a single low dynamic range (LDR) image.
The proposed model is based on a convolutional neural network composed of
dilated convolutional layers, and infers LDR images with various exposures and
illumination from a single LDR image of the same scene. Then, the final HDR
image can be formed by merging these inference results. It is relatively easy
for the proposed method to find the mapping between the LDR and an HDR with a
different bit depth because of the chaining structure inferring the
relationship between the LDR images with brighter (or darker) exposures from a
given LDR image. The method not only extends the range, but also has the
advantage of restoring the light information of the actual physical world. For
the HDR images obtained by the proposed method, the HDR-VDP2 Q score, which is
the most popular evaluation metric for HDR images, was 56.36 for a display with
a 1920$\times$1200 resolution, which is an improvement of 6 compared with the
scores of conventional algorithms. In addition, when comparing the peak
signal-to-noise ratio values for tone mapped HDR images generated by the
proposed and conventional algorithms, the average value obtained by the
proposed algorithm is 30.86 dB, which is 10 dB higher than those obtained by
the conventional algorithms.

essential task for advertising companies. Challenges arise when companies run
advertising campaigns in multiple stores which are spatially correlated, and
when the sales data have a low signal-to-noise ratio which makes the
advertising effects hard to detect. This paper proposes a solution to address
both of these challenges. A novel Bayesian method is proposed to detect weaker
impacts and a multivariate structural time series model is used to capture the
spatial correlation between stores through placing a $\mathcal{G}$-Wishart
prior on the precision matrix. The new method is to compare two posterior
distributions of a latent variable---one obtained by using the observed data
from the test stores and the other one obtained by using the data from their
counterfactual potential outcomes. The counterfactual potential outcomes are
estimated from the data of synthetic controls, each of which is a linear
combination of sales figures at many control stores over the causal period.
Control stores are selected using a revised Expectation-Maximization variable
selection (EMVS) method. A two-stage algorithm is proposed to estimate the
parameters of the model. To prevent the prediction intervals from being
explosive, a stationarity constraint is imposed on the local linear trend of
the model through a recently proposed prior. The benefit of using this prior is
discussed in this paper. A detailed simulation study shows the effectiveness of
using our proposed method to detect weaker causal impact. The new method is
applied to measure the causal effect of an advertising campaign for a consumer
product sold at stores of a large national retail chain.

to manually mark the nuclei activity biomarkers through a microscope and use a
semi-quantitative assessment method to assign a histochemical score (H-Score)
to each TMA core. Manually marking positively stained nuclei is a time
consuming, imprecise and subjective process which will lead to inter-observer
and intra-observer discrepancies. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep
learning system which directly predicts the H-Score automatically. Our system
imitates the pathologists' decision process and uses one fully convolutional
network (FCN) to extract all nuclei region (tumour and non-tumour), a second
FCN to extract tumour nuclei region, and a multi-column convolutional neural
network which takes the outputs of the first two FCNs and the stain intensity
description image as input and acts as the high-level decision making mechanism
to directly output the H-Score of the input TMA image. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that takes a TMA image as input
and directly outputs a clinical score. We will present experimental results
which demonstrate that the H-Scores predicted by our model have very high and
statistically significant correlation with experienced pathologists' scores and
that the H-Score discrepancy between our algorithm and the pathologists is on

linearly decreases the quantum fluctuation and the other tunes the evolution
rate of the Hamiltonian based on the adiabatic condition. With linear
scheduling, the required annealing time for quantum annealing by the
imaginary-time Schr\""{o}dinger equation is of order $\log N$, which is very
different from $O(N)$ required for the quantum annealing by the real-time

the required annealing time is of order $\sqrt{N}$, which is identical to the
annealing time for quantum annealing by the real-time Schr\""{o}dinger equation.
Although the scheduling based on the adiabatic condition is optimal for the

for the quantum annealing by the imaginary-time Schr\""{o}dinger equation. This
result implies that the optimal scheduling for the quantum annealing by the

effective to improve the performance of quantum annealing by the real-time

the statistical properties. Moreover, since the pixels in the shuffled image
are independent identically distributed, we can replace all the large
convolution kernels in CNN with point-wise ($1*1$) convolution kernels while
maintaining the representation ability. Experimental results on two

an electric field is considered theoretically. The convection of surfactants in
conjunction with the the combined effect electrohydrodynamic flow and
sedimentation leads to a locally varying surface tension, which subsequently
alters the drop dynamics via the interplay of Marangoni, Maxwell and
hydrodynamic stresses. Assuming small capillary number and small electric
Reynolds number, we employ a regular perturbation technique to solve the
coupled system of governing equations. It is shown that when a leaky dielectric
drop is sedimenting in another leaky dielectric fluid, Marangoni stress can
oppose the electrohydrodynamic motion severely, thereby causing corresponding
changes in internal flow pattern. Such effects further result in retardation of
drop settling velocity, which would have otherwise increased due to the
influence of charge convection. For highly mobile surfactants (high Peclet
number limit), the drop surface becomes immobilized and the charge convection
effect gets completely eliminated. For non-spherical drop shapes, the effect of
Marangoni stress is overcome by the 'tip stretching' effect on the flow field.
As a result, the drop deformation gets intensified with increment in
sensitivity of surface tension to the local surfactant concentration.
Consequently, for oblate type of deformation the elevated drag force causes
further reduction in velocity. Owing to similar reasons, prolate drops
experience lesser drag and settles faster than the surfactant-free case. In
addition to this, with increased sensitivity of interfacial tension on the
surfactant concentration, the asymmetric deformation about the equator gets
suppressed.

from the object LMC P3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been discovered
to be modulated with a 10.3-day period, making it the first extra-galactic
$\gamma$-ray binary.
  Aims. This work aims at the detection of very-high-energy (VHE, >100 GeV)
$\gamma$-ray emission and the search for modulation of the VHE signal with the
orbital period of the binary system.
  Methods. LMC P3 has been observed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S.); the acceptance-corrected exposure time is 100 h. The data set has
been folded with the known orbital period of the system in order to test for
variability of the emission. Energy spectra are obtained for the orbit-averaged
data set, and for the orbital phase bin around the VHE maximum.
  Results. VHE $\gamma$-ray emission is detected with a statistical
significance of 6.4 $\sigma$. The data clearly show variability which is
phase-locked to the orbital period of the system. Periodicity cannot be deduced
from the H.E.S.S. data set alone. The orbit-averaged luminosity in the $1-10$
TeV energy range is $(1.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{35}$ erg/s. A luminosity of $(5
\pm 1) \times 10^{35}$ erg/s is reached during 20% of the orbit. HE and VHE
$\gamma$-ray emissions are anti-correlated. LMC P3 is the most luminous
$\gamma$-ray binary known so far.

with finding the shortest planar curve of constrained curvature joining two
points with prescribed tangents, is the requirement that the curve passes
through a number of prescribed intermediate points/nodes. We refer to this
generalization as the Markov--Dubins interpolation problem. We formulate this
interpolation problem as an optimal control problem and obtain results about
the structure of its solution using optimal control theory. The Markov--Dubins
interpolants consist of a concatenation of circular ($C$) and straight-line
($S$) segments. Abnormal interpolating curves are shown to exist and
characterized; however, if the interpolating curve contains a straight-line
segment then it cannot be abnormal. We derive results about the stationarity,

any feasible interpolant with arc types of $CSC$ in each stage is proved to be
stationary, i.e., critical. We propose a numerical method for computing
Markov--Dubins interpolating paths. We illustrate the theory and the numerical
approach by four qualitatively different examples.

past seven years. The main connecting theme is the physical layer of widely
deployed sensors in Pervasive Computing domains. In particular, we have focused
on the RF-channel or on ambient audio.
  The initial problem from which we started this work was that of distributed
adaptive transmit beamforming. We have been looking for a simple method to
align the phases of jointly transmitting nodes (e.g. sensor or IoT nodes). The
algorithmic solution to this problem was to implement a distributed random
optimisation method on the participating nodes in which the transmitters and
the receiver follow an iterative question-and-answer scheme. We have been able
to derive sharp asymptotic bounds on the expected optimisation time of an
evolutionary random optimiser and presented an asymptotically optimal approach.
  One thing that we have learned from the work on these physical layer
algorithms was that the signals we work on are fragile and perceptive to
physical environmental changes. These could be obstacles such as furniture,
opened or closed windows or doors as well as movement of individuals. This
observation motivated us to view the wireless interface as a sensor for
environmental changes in Pervasive Computing environments.
  Another use of physical layer RF-signals is for security applications.
  We are currently working to further push these mentioned directions and novel
fields of physical prototyping. In particular, the calculation of mathematical
operations on the wireless channel at the time of transmission appears to
contain good potential for gains in efficiency for communication and
computation in Pervasive Computing domains.

increasingly popular because of their robustness to misspecification and their
flexibility, they are less statistically efficient than standard methods, such
as vector autoregression. In this study, we seek to improve the statistical
efficiency of local projections by developing a fully Bayesian approach that
can be used to estimate local projections using roughness penalty priors. By
incorporating such prior-induced smoothness, we can use information contained
in successive observations to enhance the statistical efficiency of an
inference. We apply the proposed approach to an analysis of monetary policy in
the United States, showing that the roughness penalty priors successfully
estimate the impulse response functions and improve the predictive accuracy of
local projections.

possibility of other explanations including outflow masers. In NGC6926, we
detect a set of redshifted masers, clustered within a pc of each other, and a
single blueshifted maser about 4.4pc away, an offset that would be unusually

the same outage event as if using orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which
proves that the outage performance of NOMA with a fixed-power scheme can

the strongest consistency model that does not compromise availability.

calculate the genus of the smoothed density field constructed from lightcone
mock galaxy catalogs. Information can be extracted from the amplitude of the
genus by considering both its redshift evolution and magnitude. The constancy
of the genus amplitude with redshift can be used as a standard population, from
which we derive constraints on the equation of state of dark energy $w_{\rm
de}$ - by measuring $A$ at $z \sim 0.1$ and $z \sim 1$, we can place an order
$\Delta w_{\rm de} \sim {\cal O}(15\%)$ constraint on $w_{\rm de}$. By
comparing $A$ to its Gaussian expectation value we can potentially derive an
additional stringent constraint on the matter density $\Delta \Omega_{\rm mat}
\sim 0.01$. We discuss the primary sources of contamination associated with the
two measurements - redshift space distortion and shot noise. With accurate
knowledge of galaxy bias, we can successfully remove the effect of redshift
space distortion, and the combined effect of shot noise and non-linear
gravitational evolution is suppressed by smoothing over suitably large scales
$R_{\rm G} \ge 15 {\rm Mpc}/h$. Without knowledge of the bias, we discuss how
joint measurements of the two and three dimensional genus can be used to
constrain the growth factor $\beta = f/b$. The method can be applied optimally

make assessment of facial attractiveness that is consistent to human
perception. To tackle this problem, various data-driven models, especially
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, were introduced, and benchmark
dataset become one of the essential elements to achieve FBP. Previous works
have formulated the recognition of facial beauty as a specific supervised
learning problem of classification, regression or ranking, which indicates that
FBP is intrinsically a computation problem with multiple paradigms. However,
most of FBP benchmark datasets were built under specific computation
constrains, which limits the performance and flexibility of the computational
model trained on the dataset. In this paper, we argue that FBP is a
multi-paradigm computation problem, and propose a new diverse benchmark
dataset, called SCUT-FBP5500, to achieve multi-paradigm facial beauty
prediction. The SCUT-FBP5500 dataset has totally 5500 frontal faces with
diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) and diverse labels
(face landmarks, beauty scores within [1,~5], beauty score distribution), which
allows different computational models with different FBP paradigms, such as
appearance-based/shape-based facial beauty classification/regression model for
male/female of Asian/Caucasian. We evaluated the SCUT-FBP5500 dataset for FBP
using different combinations of feature and predictor, and various deep
learning methods. The results indicates the improvement of FBP and the
potential applications based on the SCUT-FBP5500.

active, axially symmetric, spherical colloids is analyzed. Distinct from the
studies of self-phoresis for colloids trapped at fluid interfaces or in the
vicinity of hard walls, here we focus on the issue of self-phoresis close to a
fluid-fluid interface. In order to provide physically intuitive results
highlighting the role played by the interface, the analysis is carried out for
the case that the symmetry axis of the colloid is normal to the interface;
moreover, thermal fluctuations are not taken into account. Similarly to what
has been observed near hard walls, we find that such colloids can be set into
motion even if their whole surface is homogeneously active. This is due to the
anisotropy along the direction normal to the interface owing to the
partitioning by diffusion, among the coexisting fluid phases, of the product of
the chemical reaction taking place at the colloid surface. Different from
results corresponding to hard walls, in the case of a fluid interface the
direction of motion, i.e., towards the interface or away from it, can be
controlled by tuning the physical properties of one of the two fluid phases.
This effect is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, both by resorting to
a far-field approximation and via an exact, analytical calculation which
provides the means for a critical assessment of the approximate analysis.

form a linear system involving a structured matrix depending on a single
relaxation parameter which we introduce for regularization purposes. This leads
to the idea of studying and comparing, in theory and practice, the performance
of the fixed point method applied to these reformulations. We compute the
optimal relaxation parameters and uncover interesting connections between the
complexity bounds of the variants of the fixed point scheme we consider. These
connections follow from a close link between the spectral properties of the
associated matrices. For instance, some reformulations involve purely imaginary
eigenvalues; some involve real eigenvalues and others have all eigenvalues on
the complex circle.

induction of phase transformation. The {\beta} - {\alpha} phase transition of
tin was induced to initiate material embrittlement and enable facile removal of
thick tin deposits. The necessary steps were performed under high-vacuum
conditions for an in-situ demonstration of the removal of severe tin
contamination from optics used for reflection of extreme ultraviolet light.
Molten tin of high purity was dripped onto mirror samples, inoculated with
small seed particles of gray tin and then cooled to temperatures in the range
of -25 {\deg}C to -40 {\deg}C. As recorded by photographic imaging, the drops
were converted in an evacuated chamber to gray tin by induction of tin pest
leading to their disintegration within a few hours. They could then be easily
cleaned or fell off from the surface without causing any damage of the
multilayer coating. Cleaning of tin contamination from the mirrors with almost
complete structural transformation of the tin drops and subsequent removal by
puffs of dry gas could be achieved within a day. The fraction of area coverage
of untransformed tin remaining on the samples after cleaning was evaluated from
the images and generally found to be well below 1%. After tin dripping, phase
transition and cleaning, analysis of the reflectance of a Mo/Si-coated mirror

the non-intrusive software library XBraid, which applies an iterative multigrid
reduction technique to the time domain of existing time-marching schemes for
solving unsteady PDEs. Its general user-interface has been extended for
computing adjoint sensitivities such that gradients of output quantities with
respect to design changes can be computed parallel-in-time alongside with the
primal PDE solution. In this paper, the primal and adjoint XBraid iterations
are embedded into a simultaneous optimization framework, namely the One-shot
method. In this method, design updates towards optimality are employed after
each state and adjoint update such that optimality and feasibility of the
design and the PDE solution are reached simultaneously. The time-parallel
optimization method is validated on an advection-dominated flow control problem
which shows significant speedup over a classical time-serial optimization
algorithm.

advanced RA schemes: Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA (CRDSA),

Enhanced Spread-Spectrum ALOHA (E-SSA). We show that typical simplifications of
the reception model when used to optimize RA schemes lead to inaccurate
findings, both in terms of parameter optimization and figures of merit, such as
the packet loss ratio (PLR) and throughput. We also derive a generic RA energy
efficiency model able to compare the schemes in terms of the energy required to
transmit a packet. The combination of achievable RA throughput at the target
PLR and energy efficiency, for the same average user power investment per frame
and occupied bandwidth, shows that E-SSA, which is an unslotted scheme,
provides the best overall performance, while, in terms of the slotted schemes,
CRDSA outperforms the more elaborated IRSA and CSA. This surprising results is
due to the fact that the IRSA and CSA optimization has so far been performed
using RA channel models that are not accurately reflecting the physical layer
receiver behavior. We conclude by providing insights on how to include more
accurate reception models in the IRSA and CSA design and optimization.

be disjoint simply-connected domains. Must one of $f^{-1}(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$
be disconnected?
  In 1970, Baker implicitly gave a positive answer to this question, in order
to prove that a transcendental entire function cannot have two disjoint
completely invariant domains. (A domain $U\subset \mathbb{C}$ is completely
invariant under $f$ if $f^{-1}(U)=U$.)
  It was recently observed by Julien Duval that there is a flaw in Baker's
argument (which has also been used in later generalisations and extensions of
Baker's result). We show that the answer to the above question is negative; so
this flaw cannot be repaired. Indeed, for the function $f(z)= e^z+z$, there is
a collection of infinitely many pairwise disjoint simply-connected domains,
each with connected preimage. We also answer a long-standing question of
Eremenko by giving an example of a transcendental entire function, with
infinitely many poles, which has the same property.
  Furthermore, we show that there exists a function $f$ with the above
properties such that additionally the set of singular values $S(f)$ is bounded;
in other words, $f$ belongs to the Eremenko-Lyubich class. On the other hand,
if $S(f)$ is finite (or if certain additional hypotheses are imposed), many of
the original results do hold.
  For the convenience of the research community, we also include a description
of the error in the proof of Baker's paper, and a summary of other papers that

lineage were analyzed in laboratory experiments in the presence and the absence
of sub-lethal doses of UVR (UV-A band), and we identified trade-offs among
variables through structural equation modeling (SEM). The UVR treatment was
detrimental to almost all life-history variables of both lineages; however, the
Daphnia historically exposed to higher doses of UVR (HighUV) showed a higher
overall fecundity than those historically exposed to lower doses of UVR
(LowUV). The total offspring and ephippia production, as well as the number of
clutches and number of offspring at first reproduction, was directly affected
by UVR in both lineages. Main differences between lineages involved indirect
effects that affected offspring production as the age at first reproduction. We
here show that organisms within the same species have developed different
strategies as responses to UVR, although no increased physiological tolerance
or plasticity was shown by the HighUV lineage. In addition to known tolerance
strategies to UVR, including avoidance, prevention, or repairing of damages, we
here propose a population strategy that includes early reproduction and high
fertility, which we show compensated for the fitness loss imposed by UVR
stress.

parameter space reduction methodology based on active subspaces to the hull
hydrodynamic design problem. Several parametric deformations of an initial hull
shape are considered to assess the influence of the shape parameters considered
on the hull total drag. The hull resistance is typically computed by means of
numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Given the high
number of parameters involved - which might result in a high number of time
consuming hydrodynamic simulations - assessing whether the parameters space can
be reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction. Thus, the
main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces to identify possible
lower dimensional structures in the parameter space, or to verify the parameter
distribution in the position of the control points. To this end, a fully
automated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape
perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry which are then used to carry out
high-fidelity flow simulations and collect data for the active subspaces
analysis. To achieve full automation of the open source pipeline described,
both the free form deformation methodology employed for the hull perturbations
and the solver based on unsteady potential flow theory, with fully nonlinear
free surface treatment, are directly interfaced with CAD data structures and
operate using IGES vendor-neutral file formats as input files. The
computational cost of the fluid dynamic simulations is further reduced through
the application of dynamic mode decomposition to reconstruct the steady state
total drag value given only few initial snapshots of the simulation. The active
subspaces analysis is here applied to the geometry of the DTMB-5415 naval
combatant hull, which is a common benchmark in ship hydrodynamics simulations.

out-of-equilibrium state allows us to obtain work and to carry information.
Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an advanced approach,
conditionally preparing more efficient out-of-equilibrium states only by a weak
dissipation, an inefficient quantum measurement of the dissipated thermal
energy, and subsequent triggering of that states. Although it conditionally
subtracts the energy quanta from the oscillator, average energy grows, and
second-order correlation function approaches unity as by coherent external
driving. On the other hand, the Fano factor remains constant and the entropy of
the subtracted state increases, which raise doubts about a possible application
of this approach. To resolve it, we predict and experimentally verify that both
available work and transmitted information can be conditionally higher in this
case than by arbitrary cooling or adequate thermal heating up to the same
average energy. It qualifies the conditional procedure as a useful source for
experiments in quantum information and thermodynamics.

consumption of wireless devices. Simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) is a promising solution for sustainable operation of IoT
devices. In this paper, we study energy efficiency (EE) in SWIPT-based
distributed antenna system (DAS), where power splitting (PS) is applied at IoT
devices to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID)
processes by varying transmit power of distributed antenna (DA) ports and PS
ratios of IoT devices. In the case of single IoT device, we find the optimal
closed-form solution by deriving some useful properties based on
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the solution is no need for numerical
iterations. For the case of multiple IoT devices, we propose an efficient
suboptimal algorithm to solve the EE maximization problem. Simulation results
show that the proposed schemes achieve better EE performance compared with
other benchmark schemes in both single and multiple IoT devices cases.

expanding universes within the context of the five and thirteen field theories

general dispersion relation has been derived with the help of relevant
linearized perturbation equations, showing that the shear viscosity parameter
alters the propagating modes for large and small wavelengths. The behavior of
density and temperature contrasts are analyzed for the hard-sphere model in
detail. In the small wavelengths regime, increasing the amount of shear
viscosity into the system forces the harmonic perturbations to damp faster,
however, in the opposite limit larger values of shear viscosity lead to smaller
values of density and temperature contrasts. For the hyperbolic case, the
dispersion relation becomes a polynomial in the frequency with two orders
higher in relation to the five-field theory, indicating that the effects
associated with the shear viscosity and heat flux are non-trivial. The profile
of Jeans mass in terms of the temperature and number density is explored by
contrasting with several data of molecular clouds. Regarding the dynamical
evolution of the density, temperature, stress and heat flux contrasts for a
universe dominated by pressureless matter, we obtain also damped harmonic waves
for small wavelengths. In the case of large wavelengths, the density and
temperature contrasts grow with time (due to the Jeans mechanism) while the
stress and heat flux contrasts heavily decay with time.

Here $\sigma$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, $p_A = p - A$, with $p =
-i\nabla$ the three-dimensional momentum operator and $A$ a given magnetic
vector potential, and $C_s$ is the critical Hardy constant, that is, the
optimal constant in the Hardy inequality $|p|^{2s} \geq C_s/|x|^{2s}$. If spin
is neglected, results of this type are known in the literature as
Hardy-Lieb-Thirring inequalities, which bound the sum of negative eigenvalues
from below by $-M_s\int V_{-}^{1 + 3/(2s)}$, for a positive constant $M_s$. The
inclusion of magnetic fields in this case follows from the non-magnetic case by
diamagnetism. The addition of spin, however, offers extra challenges that make
the result more elusive. It is the purpose of this article to resolve this
problem by providing simple bounds for the sum of the negative eigenvalues of
the operator in question. In particular, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$ we are able to
express the bound purely in terms of the magnetic field energy $\|B\|_2^2$ and

applications has rendered graph querying to be a problem of paramount
importance. Traditional techniques use structural as well as node similarities
to find matches of a given query graph in a (large) target graph. However,
almost all existing techniques have tacitly ignored the presence of
relationships in graphs, which are usually encoded through interactions between
node and edge labels. In this paper, we propose RAQ -- Relationship-Aware Graph
Querying, to mitigate this gap. Given a query graph, RAQ identifies the $k$
best matching subgraphs of the target graph that encode similar relationships
as in the query graph. To assess the utility of RAQ as a graph querying
paradigm for knowledge discovery and exploration tasks, we perform a user
survey on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), where an overwhelming 86% of the
170 surveyed users preferred the relationship-aware match over traditional
graph querying. The need to perform subgraph isomorphism renders RAQ NP-hard.
The querying is made practical through beam stack search. Extensive experiments
on multiple real-world graph datasets demonstrate RAQ to be effective,
efficient, and scalable.

around an isolated invariant set $S$. It is defined as the homotopy type of a
quotient space $N/L$, where $(N,L)$ is an index pair for $S$. In the case of a
discrete dynamical system, i.e., a continuous self-map $f\colon X\to X$, the
definition is similar. But one needs to consider the index map $f_{(N,L)}\colon
N/L\to N/L$ induced by $f$. The Conley index in this situation is defined as
the homotopy class $[f_{(N,L)}]$ modulo shift equivalence. The shift
equivalence relation is rarely used outside this context and not well
understood in general. For practical purposes like numerical computations, one
needs to use weaker algebraic invariants for distinguishing Conley indices,
usually homology. Here we consider a topological invariant: the homotopy type
of the mapping torus of the index map $f_{(N,L)}$. Using a homotopy type offers
new ways for comparing Conley indices -- theoretically and numerically. We
present some basic properties and examples, compare it to the definition via
shift equivalence and sketch an idea for its construction using rigorous

requirement for systems with modular structures was that the network of modules
must be hierarchically organized and possess finite dimension. We investigate
the dynamical behavior of an activity spreading model, evolving on
heterogeneous random networks with highly modular structure and organized
non-hierarchically. We observe that loosely coupled modules act as effective
rare-regions, slowing down the extinction of activation. As a consequence, we
find extended control parameter regions with continuously changing dynamical
exponents for single network realizations, preserved after finite size
analyses, as in a real GP. The avalanche size distributions of spreading events
exhibit robust power-law tails. Our findings relax the requirement of
hierarchical organization of the modular structure, which can help to
rationalize the criticality of modular systems in the framework of GPs.

finding optimal query plans. It is especially challenging for RDF due to the
lack of explicit schema and the excessive occurrence of joins in RDF queries.
Existing approaches typically collect statistics based on the counts of triples
and estimate the cardinality of a query as the product of its join components,
where errors can accumulate even when the estimation of each component is
accurate. As opposed to existing methods, we propose PRESTO, a cardinality
estimation method that is based on the counts of subgraphs instead of triples
and uses a probabilistic method to estimate cardinalities of RDF queries as a
whole. PRESTO avoids some major issues of existing approaches and is able to
accurately estimate arbitrary queries under a bound memory constraint. We
evaluate PRESTO with YAGO and show that PRESTO is more accurate for both simple

postulates of quantum theory we study the properties of bi-partite systems in

purification principle is violated, meaning that some mixed states are not the
reduction of a pure state in a larger system. This allows us to derive the
measurement postulates of quantum theory from the structure of pure states and
reversible dynamics, and the requirement that the purification principle holds.
The violation of the purification principle implies that there is some
irreducible classicality in these theories, which appears like an important
clue for the problem of deriving the Born rule within the many-worlds
interpretation. We also prove that in all such modifications the task of state
tomography with local measurements is impossible, and present a simple toy
theory displaying all these exotic non-quantum phenomena. This toy model shows
that, contrarily to previous claims, it is possible to modify the Born rule
without violating the no-signalling principle. Finally, we argue that the
quantum measurement postulates are the most non-classical amongst all

encompasses the mass of the physical strange quark. We express the successive
orders in terms of physical meson and baryon masses. In addition, owing to
specific correlations amongst the chiral moments, we suggest a reordering of

Our scheme is tested against QCD lattice data, where the low-energy parameters

for large-area, low energy-density applications. Both the electrical current
and heat transfer are in the plane of the thermoelectric thin-film, yet the
heat transfer is across the plane of the module - similar to conventional bulk
thermoelectric modules. With such designs, the heat leakage through the module
itself can be minimized and the available temperature gradient maximized.
Different from the previously reported corrugated thermoelectric generators,
the proposed folding scheme enables high packing densities without compromising
the thermal contact area to the heat source and sink. The significance of
various thermal transport, or leakage, mechanisms in relation to power
production is demonstrated for different packing densities and thicknesses of
the module under heat sink-limited conditions. It is shown that the power
factor is more important than ZT for predicting the power output of such
thin-film devices. As very thin thermoelectric films are employed with modest
temperature gradients, high aspect-ratio elements are needed to meet the -
usually ignored - requirements of practical applications for the current. With
the design trade-offs considered, the proposed devices may enable the
exploitation of thermoelectric energy harvesting in new - large-area -
applications at reasonable cost.

formally define the concept of differential privacy for structured databases

notion between graphs. This definition is adapted to particular frameworks that
can be met in various application fields such as genomics, world wide web,
population survey, etc. Second, we introduce a new algorithm to tackle the
issue of privately releasing an approximated minimum spanning tree topology for
a simple-undirected-weighted graph. It provides a simple way of producing the
topology of a private almost minimum spanning tree which outperforms, in most
cases, the state of the art ""Laplace mechanism"" in terms of
weight-approximation error.
  Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated method combining a sanitizing
mechanism (such as Laplace or our new algorithm) with a Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST)-based clustering algorithm. It provides an accurate method for nodes
clustering in a graph while keeping the sensitive information contained in the
edges weights of the private graph. We provide some theoretical results on the
robustness of an almost minimum spanning tree construction for Laplace
sanitizing mechanisms. These results exhibit which conditions the graph weights
should respect in order to consider that the nodes form well separated clusters
both for Laplace and our algorithm as sanitizing mechanism. The method has been
experimentally evaluated on simulated data, and preliminary results show the
good behavior of the algorithm while identifying well separated clusters.

learning compact representations that are relevant to a given task (feature
extraction, dimensionality reduction, denoising, etc.). The model complexity is
encoded by means of specific structure, such as sparsity, low-rankness, or
nonnegativity. Unfortunately, approaches like K-SVD - that learn dictionaries
for sparse coding via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - are hard to scale to
high-volume and high-dimensional visual data, and fragile in the presence of
outliers. Conversely, robust component analysis methods such as the Robust
Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) are able to recover low-complexity (e.g.,
low-rank) representations from data corrupted with noise of unknown magnitude
and support, but do not provide a dictionary that respects the structure of the
data (e.g., images), and also involve expensive computations. In this paper, we
propose a novel Kronecker-decomposable component analysis model, coined as
Robust Kronecker Component Analysis (RKCA), that combines ideas from sparse
dictionary learning and robust component analysis. RKCA has several appealing
properties, including robustness to gross corruption; it can be used for
low-rank modeling, and leverages separability to solve significantly smaller
problems. We design an efficient learning algorithm by drawing links with a
restricted form of tensor factorization, and analyze its optimality and
low-rankness properties. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated on real-world applications, namely background subtraction and
image denoising and completion, by performing a thorough comparison with the

beneficial for many tasks, ranging from cross-lingual information retrieval and
plagiarism detection to machine translation. Recently proposed methods for
predicting cross-lingual semantic similarity of short texts, however, make use
of tools and resources (e.g., machine translation systems, syntactic parsers or
named entity recognition) that for many languages (or language pairs) do not
exist. In contrast, we propose an unsupervised and a very resource-light
approach for measuring semantic similarity between texts in different
languages. To operate in the bilingual (or multilingual) space, we project
continuous word vectors (i.e., word embeddings) from one language to the vector
space of the other language via the linear translation model. We then align
words according to the similarity of their vectors in the bilingual embedding
space and investigate different unsupervised measures of semantic similarity
exploiting bilingual embeddings and word alignments. Requiring only a
limited-size set of word translation pairs between the languages, the proposed
approach is applicable to virtually any pair of languages for which there
exists a sufficiently large corpus, required to learn monolingual word
embeddings. Experimental results on three different datasets for measuring
semantic textual similarity show that our simple resource-light approach
reaches performance close to that of supervised and resource intensive methods,
displaying stability across different language pairs. Furthermore, we evaluate
the proposed method on two extrinsic tasks, namely extraction of parallel
sentences from comparable corpora and cross lingual plagiarism detection, and
show that it yields performance comparable to those of complex
resource-intensive state-of-the-art models for the respective tasks.

particularly at extremities. Detecting and modeling the rate of anisotropy in
fingerprint growth, and possibly other growth patterns as well, facilitates the
use of children's fingerprints for long-term biometric identification. Using
standard fingerprint scanners, anisotropic growth is highly overshadowed by the
varying distortions created by each imprint, and it seems that this difficulty
has hampered to date the development of suitable methods, detecting anisotropy,
let alone, designing models. We provide a tool chain to statistically detect,
with a given confidence, anisotropic growth in fingerprints and its preferred
axis, where we only require a standard fingerprint scanner and a minutiae
matcher. We build on a perturbation model, a new Procrustes-type algorithm, use
and develop several parametric and non-parametric tests for different
hypotheses, in particular for neighborhood hypotheses to detect the axis of
anisotropy, where the latter tests are tunable to measurement accuracy. Taking
into account realistic distortions caused by pressing fingers on scanners, our
simulations based on real data indicate that, for example, already in rather
small samples (56 matches) we can significantly detect proximal-distal growth

systems, such as the broadly studied Zipf and Heaps laws, respectively
concerning the distribution of component frequencies and their number as a
function of system size. Dependency structures (i.e., directed networks
encoding the dependency relations between the components in a system) were
proposed recently as a possible organizing principles underlying some of the
regularities observed. However, the consequences of this assumption were
explored only in binary component systems, where solely the presence or absence
of components is considered, and multiple copies of the same component are not
allowed. Here, we consider a simple model that generates, from a given ensemble
of dependency structures, a statistical ensemble of sets of components,
allowing for components to appear with any multiplicity. Our model is a minimal
extension that is memoryless, and therefore accessible to analytical
calculations. A mean-field analytical approach (analogous to the ""Zipfian
ensemble"" in the linguistics literature) captures the relevant laws describing

develop lower-cost alternatives to lithium-ion batteries constructed from more

monovalent ion results in a deteriorating performance of the electrode. Using
first-principles electronic structure calculations, we identify the relaxed
geometries of the structure for various positions of the ion in the structure.
We then use these geometries to compute the energy of formations. Additionally,
we determine that all ions are favorable in the structure, but interlayer
positions are preferred compared to vacancy positions. We also conclude that
the exchange between the interlayer and vacancy positions is a process which
involves the interaction between interlayer water and surface hydroxyl groups

water and $\text{OH}$ groups to assist alkali-ions to move from the interlayer

images in the training set should have similar quality as those in the testing
set. To handle real-world application scenarios where images with different
kinds and severities of degradation can be presented to the system, we have
developed a quality classified image analysis framework to deal with images of
mixed qualities adaptively. We use deep neural networks first to classify
images based on their quality classes and then design a separate face detector
and recognizer for images in each quality class. We will present experimental
results to show that our quality classified framework can accurately classify
images based on the type and severity of image degradations and can
significantly boost the performances of state-of-the-art face detector and
recognizer in dealing with image datasets containing mixed quality images.

abundance measurements using Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
Green Bank Telescope spectra of four sightlines passing through the LA, and
three nearby sightlines that may trace outer fragments of the LA. We find low
oxygen abundances, ranging from 4.0(+4.0,-2.0) percent solar to 12.6(+6.2,-4.1)
percent solar, in the confirmed LA directions, with the lowest values found in
the region known as LA III, farthest from the LMC. These abundances are
substantially lower than the single previous measurement, S/H=35+/-7 percent
solar (Lu et al. 1998), but are in agreement with those reported in the SMC
filament of the trailing Stream, supporting a common origin in the SMC (not the
LMC) for the majority of the LA and the trailing Stream. This provides
important constraints for models of the formation of the Magellanic System.
Finally, the HVCs in two of the three nearby sightlines show H I columns,
kinematics, and oxygen abundances consistent with LA membership. This suggests
that the LA is larger than traditionally thought, extending at least 20 degrees
further to the Galactic northwest.

attracted the attention of medical doctors and researchers since variations in

learning methods producing dense predictions. This branch, referred in the
literature as Fully CNN (FCNN), is of interest as these architectures can
process an input volume in less time than CNNs and local spatial dependencies
may be encoded since several voxels are classified at once. Our study focuses
on understanding architectural strengths and weaknesses of literature-like
approaches. Hence, we implement eight FCNN architectures inspired by robust
state-of-the-art methods on brain segmentation related tasks. We evaluate them
using the IBSR18, MICCAI2012 and iSeg2017 datasets as they contain infant and
adult data and exhibit varied voxel spacing, image quality, number of scans and

comparison between 2D and 3D approaches, the importance of multiple modalities

focused on diffraction-limited QWIP structures (lambda/2), RC constants cannot
be reduced indefinitely, and detection speeds are bound to eventually meet un

detectors based on a 3D split-ring geometry, yielding ultra-fast operation at a

efforts in building distributed systems by (1) providing an interface
definition language (IDL) to specify precisely the structure of the message
(i.e., the message schema), and (2) automatically generating the serialization
and deserialization functions that transform user data structures into binary
data for sending across the network and vice versa. Similarly, a
hardware-accelerated system, which consists of host software and multiple
FPGAs, could also benefit from a messaging framework to handle messages both
between software and FPGA and also between different FPGAs. The key challenge
for a hardware messaging framework is that it must be able to support large
messages with complex schema while meeting critical constraints such as clock
frequency, area, and throughput.
  In this paper, we present HGum, a messaging framework for hardware
accelerators that meets all the above requirements. HGum is able to generate
high-performance and low-cost hardware logic by employing a novel design that
algorithmically parses the message schema to perform serialization and
deserialization. Our evaluation of HGum shows that it not only significantly
reduces engineering efforts but also generates hardware with comparable quality
to manual implementation.

electron-phonon interactions can influence the thermalization process of the
excited electrons. We study the interplay of the underlying scattering
mechanisms for the case of a noble metal with help of a set of complete
Boltzmann collision integrals. We trace the transient electron distribution in
copper and its deviations from a Fermi-Dirac distribution due to the excitation
with an ultrashort laser pulse. We investigate the different stages of
electronic nonequilibrium after an excitation with an ultrashort laser-pulse of
800 nm wavelength and 10 fs pulse duration. Our calculations show a strong
nonequilibrium during and directly after the end of the laser pulse.
Subsequently, we find a fast thermalization of most electrons. Surprisingly, we
observe a long-lasting nonequilibrium, which can be attributed to the
electron-phonon scattering. This nonequilibrium establishes at energies around
peaks in the density of states of the electrons and persists on the timescale
of electron-phonon energy relaxation. It influences in turn the electron phonon
coupling strength.

extended at the quantum level through the Vilkovisky--De Witt formalism and the

Another difference is that the Casimir forces acting on the separate plates do
not coincide if the corresponding Robin coefficients are different. At large
separations between the plates the decay of the forces is power law. We show
that during the cosmological expansion the forces may change the sign.

transmission electron microscopy (DPC-STEM) imaging assumes that the phase
gradient imposed on the probe by the sample causes the diffraction pattern
intensity to shift rigidly by an amount proportional to that phase gradient.
This behaviour is seldom realised exactly in practice. Through a combination of
experimental results, analytical modelling and numerical calculations, we
explore the breakdown of the rigid-intensity-shift behaviour and how this
depends on the magnitude of the phase gradient and the relative scale of

when the rigid-intensity-shift model can be applied for quantitative phase

emerging standard that aims at enhancing air traffic management by
transitioning the traditional analog aeronautical communication systems to the
superior and highly efficient digital domain. L-DACS1 employs modern and
efficient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
technique to achieve more efficient and higher data rate in comparison to the
existing aeronautical communication systems. However, the performance of OFDM
systems is very sensitive to synchronization errors such as symbol timing
offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO). STO and CFO estimations are
extremely important for maintaining orthogonality among the subcarriers for the
retrieval of information. This paper proposes a novel efficient hardware
synchronizer for L-DACS1 systems that offers robust performance at low power
and low hardware resource usage. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed
synchronization algorithm provides accurate STO estimation as well as
fractional CFO estimation. Implementation of the proposed synchronizer on a
widely used field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (Xilinx xc7z020clg484-1)
results in a very low hardware usage which consumed 6.5%, 3.7%, and 6.4% of the
total number of lookup tables, flip-flops, and digital signal processing
blocks, respectively. The dynamic power of the proposed synchronizer is below 1
mW.

problems such as lack of interdisciplinary knowledge required for effective
software/hardware co-design, and a growing technology transfer gap between
academia and industry.
  We introduce our new educational initiative to tackle these problems by
developing Collective Knowledge (CK), a unified experimental framework for
computer systems research and development. We use CK to teach the community how
to make their research artifacts and experimental workflows portable,
reproducible, customizable and reusable while enabling sustainable R&D and
facilitating technology transfer. We also demonstrate how to redesign
multi-objective autotuning and machine learning as a portable and extensible CK
workflow. Such workflows enable researchers to experiment with different
applications, data sets and tools; crowdsource experimentation across diverse
platforms; share experimental results, models, visualizations; gradually expose
more design and optimization choices using a simple JSON API; and ultimately
build upon each other's findings.
  As the first practical step, we have implemented customizable compiler
autotuning, crowdsourced optimization of diverse workloads across Raspberry Pi
3 devices, reduced the execution time and code size by up to 40%, and applied
machine learning to predict optimizations. We hope such approach will help
teach students how to build upon each others' work to enable efficient and
self-optimizing software/hardware/model stack for emerging workloads.

  Model for X-Ray CT","11 pages,6 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical image reconstruction (SIR) methods for X-ray CT produce
high-quality and accurate images, while greatly reducing patient exposure to
radiation. When further reducing X-ray dose to an ultra-low level by lowering
the tube current, photon starvation happens and electronic noise starts to
dominate, which introduces negative or zero values into the raw measurements.
These non-positive values pose challenges to post-log SIR methods that require
taking the logarithm of the raw data, and causes artifacts in the reconstructed
images if simple correction methods are used to process these non-positive raw
measurements. The raw data at ultra-low dose deviates significantly from
Poisson or shifted Poisson statistics for pre-log data and from Gaussian
statistics for post-log data. This paper proposes a novel SIR method called MPG
(mixed Poisson-Gaussian). MPG models the raw noisy measurements using a mixed
Poisson-Gaussian distribution that accounts for both the quantum noise and
electronic noise. MPG is able to directly use the negative and zero values in
raw data without any pre-processing. MPG cost function contains a reweighted
least square data-fit term, an edge preserving regularization term and a
non-negativity constraint term. We use Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) to separate the MPG optimization problem into several
sub-problems that are easier to solve. Our results on 3D simulated cone-beam
data set and synthetic helical data set generated from clinical data indicate
that the proposed MPG method reduces noise and decreases bias in the
reconstructed images, comparing with the conventional filtered back projection
(FBP), penalized weighted least-square (PWLS) and shift Poisson (SP) method for
ultra-low dose CT (ULDCT) imaging.

each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its
invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to
simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards in
these situations. Finally, we introduce an Emotional Reciprocal Velocity
Obstacles (ERVO) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the
traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which combines the emotional
impact and local avoidance together for the first time. Our experimental
results show that this method can soundly generate realistic group behaviors as
well as panic emotion dynamics in a crowd in multi-hazard environments.
