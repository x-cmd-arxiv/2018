The choice to describe short persistence features as a group reduces

unaffected by the magnetic presence. The magnetic pressure dominates on small

difficult due to the optimization over all possible sets of local projection
measurements. Therefore, it is crucial to develop lower bounds, which can
provide useful information about the behaviour of localizable entanglement, and
which can be determined by measuring a limited number of operators, or by
performing least number of measurements on the state, preferably without
performing a full state tomography. In this paper, we adopt two different yet
related approaches to obtain a witness-based, and a measurement-based lower
bounds for localizable entanglement. The former is determined by the minimal
amount of entanglement that can be present in a subsystem of the multipartite
quantum state, which is consistent with the expectation value of an
entanglement witness. Determining this bound does not require any information
about the state beyond the expectation value of the witness operator, which
renders this approach highly practical in experiments. The latter bound of
localizable entanglement is computed by restricting the local projection
measurements over the qubits outside the subsystem of interest to a suitably
chosen basis. We discuss the behaviour of both lower bounds against local
physical noise on the qubits, and discuss their dependence on noise strength
and system size. We also analytically determine the measurement-based lower
bound in the case of graph states under local uncorrelated Pauli noise.

semantic segmentation benchmarking framework with a decoupled design for
feature extraction and decoding methods. The framework is comprised of
different network architectures for feature extraction such as VGG16, Resnet18,
MobileNet, and ShuffleNet. It is also comprised of multiple meta-architectures
for segmentation that define the decoding methodology. These include SkipNet,
UNet, and Dilation Frontend. Experimental results are presented on the
Cityscapes dataset for urban scenes. The modular design allows novel
architectures to emerge, that lead to 143x GFLOPs reduction in comparison to

after the burst. The afterglow started to emerge at these low frequencies about
60~days after the burst. The $1390$~MHz light curve barely evolved between 60

used to directly test whether dark matter satisfies Euler's equation, i.e.
whether its free fall is characterised by geodesic motion, just like baryons
and light. After having proposed a general parametrisation for deviations from
Euler's equation, we perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for future surveys like
DESI and the SKA, and show that such deviations can be constrained with a
precision of order 10%. Deviations from Euler's equation cannot be tested
directly with standard methods like redshift-space distortions and
gravitational lensing, since these observables are not sensitive to the time
component of the metric. Our analysis shows therefore that relativistic effects
bring new and complementary constraints to alternative theories of gravity.

valuable, the speed at which it is released makes it difficult to quickly

approach relies crucially on the Hessian correlation between theory-data
residuals and the PDFs themselves, as well as on a newly defined quantity ---
the sensitivity --- which represents an extension of the correlation and
reflects both PDF-driven and experimental uncertainties. This approach is
realized in a new, publicly available analysis package PDFSense, which operates
with these statistical measures to identify particularly sensitive experiments,
weigh their relative or potential impact on PDFs, and visualize their detailed
distributions in a space of the parton momentum fraction $x$ and factorization
scale $\mu$. This tool offers a new means of understanding the influence of
individual measurements in existing fits, as well as a predictive device for
directing future fits toward the highest impact data and assumptions. Along the
way, many new physics insights can be gained or reinforced. As one of many
examples, PDFSense is employed to rank the projected impact of new LHC
measurements in jet, vector boson, and $t\bar{t}$ production and leads us to
the conclusion that inclusive jet production at the LHC has a potential for
playing an indispensable role in future PDF fits. These conclusions are

parametrization of a three burst star formation history, and a comprehensive
analysis of all other model parameters. We have been able to estimate the
contribution of the underlying old stellar population to the observed
equivalent width of H$\beta$ and allow for more accurate burst age
determination.
  We found that the star formation histories of HII Galaxies can be reproduced
remarkably well by three major eras of star formation. In addition, the SED
fitting results indicate that: i) in all cases the current burst produces less
than a few percent of the total stellar mass: the bulk of stellar mass in HII
galaxies have been produced by the past episodes of star formation; ii) at a
given age the H$\beta$ luminosity depends only on the mass of young stars
favouring a universal IMF for massive stars; iii) the current star formation
episodes are {\it maximal} starbursts, producing stars at the highest possible
rate.

front of the PDR. Part of the dust condensations are seen in spectral line
emissions of CS (5-4) and H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), though the CS map also

$73\pm58$ K. A non-thermal velocity dispersion of ~0.25 - 0.50 km s$^{-1}$ is
derived from the high spectral resolution C$^{34}$S data, and indicates a
subsonic to transonic turbulence in the condensations. The masses of the
condensations are estimated from the dust emission, and range from 0.03 to 0.3
$M_{\odot}$, all significantly lower than any critical mass that is required
for self-gravity to play a crucial role. Thus the condensations are not
gravitationally bound, and could not collapse to form stars. In cooperating
with recent high resolution observations of the surface layers of the molecular
cloud in the Bar, we speculate that the condensations are produced as a
high-pressure wave induced by the expansion of the HII region compresses and
enters the cloud. A velocity gradient along a direction perpendicular to the
major axis of the Bar is seen in H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), and is
consistent with the scenario that the molecular gas behind the dissociation

measuring the mass-loss rates of O- and early-B stars. Our approach, which has
no adjustable parameters, uses the principle of pressure equilibrium between
the stellar wind and the ambient interstellar medium for a high-velocity star
generating an infrared bowshock nebula. Results for twenty bowshock-generating
stars show good agreement with two sets of theoretical predictions for O5--O9.5
main-sequence stars, yielding $\dot M=$1.3$\times$10$^{-6}$ to
2$\times$10$^{-9}$ solar masses per year. Although $\dot M$ values derived for
this sample are smaller than theoretical expectations by a factor of about two,
this discrepancy is greatly reduced compared to canonical mass-loss methods.
Bowshock-derived mass-loss rates are factors of ten smaller than
H$\alpha$-based measurements (uncorrected for clumping) for similar stellar
types and are nearly an order of magnitude larger than P$^{4+}$ and some other
UV absorption-line-based diagnostics. Ambient interstellar densities of at
least several cm$^{-3}$ appear to be required for formation of a prominent
infrared bowshock nebula. $\dot M$ measurements for early-B stars are not yet
compelling owing to the small number in our sample and the lack of clear
theoretical predictions in the regime of lower stellar luminosities. These
results may constitute a partial resolution of the extant ""weak-wind problem""

designed to be compatible with the OCaml philosophy and runtime model. This is
a proposal to extend the OCaml language with destructors, move semantics, and
resource polymorphism, to improve its safety, efficiency, interoperability, and
expressiveness. It builds on the ownership-and-borrowing models of systems
programming languages (Cyclone, C++11, Rust) and on linear types in functional
programming (Linear Lisp, Clean, Alms). It continues a synthesis of resources
from systems programming and resources in linear logic initiated by Baker.
  It is a combination of many known and some new ideas. On the novel side, it
highlights the good mathematical structure of Stroustrup's ""Resource
acquisition is initialisation"" (RAII) idiom for resource management based on
destructors, a notion sometimes confused with finalizers, and builds on it a
notion of resource polymorphism, inspired by polarisation in proof theory, that
mixes C++'s RAII and a tracing garbage collector (GC).
  The proposal targets a new spot in the design space, with an automatic and
predictable resource-management model, at the same time based on lightweight
and expressive language abstractions. It is backwards-compatible: current code
is expected to run with the same performance, the new abstractions fully
combine with the current ones, and it supports a resource-polymorphic extension
of libraries. It does so with only a few additions to the runtime, and it
integrates with the current GC implementation. It is also compatible with the
upcoming multicore extension, and suggests that the Rust model for eliminating
data-races applies.
  Interesting questions arise for a safe and practical type system, many of
which have already been thoroughly investigated in the languages and prototypes

investigate what non-equilibrium information can be extracted from non-invasive
measurements using a stochastic model of soft elastic networks with a
heterogeneous distribution of activities, representing enzymatic force
generation. In particular, we use this model to study how the non-equilibrium
activity, detected by tracking two probes in the network, scales as a function
of the distance between the probes. We quantify the non-equilibrium dynamics
through the cycling frequencies, a simple measure of circulating currents in
the phase space of the probes. We find that these cycling frequencies exhibit
power-law scaling behavior with the distance between probes. In addition, we
show that this scaling behavior governs the entropy production rate that can be
recovered from the two traced probes. Our results provide insight in to how
internal enzymatic driving generates non-equilibrium dynamics on different
scales in soft biological assemblies.

  Graphs","11 pages full version",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the optimal multi-agent persistent monitoring problem defined by
a team of cooperating agents visiting a set of nodes (targets) on a graph with
the objective of minimizing a measure of overall node state uncertainty. The
solution to this problem involves agent trajectories defined both by the
sequence of nodes to be visited by each agent and the amount of time spent at
each node. Since such optimal trajectories are generally intractable, we
propose a class of distributed threshold-based parametric controllers through
which agent transitions from one node to the next are controlled by threshold
parameters on the node uncertainty states. The resulting behavior of the
agent-target system can be described by a hybrid dynamic system. This enables
the use of Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to determine on line
(locally) optimal threshold parameters through gradient descent methods and
thus obtain optimal controllers within this family of threshold-based policies.
We further show that in a single-agent case the IPA gradient is monotonic,
which implies a simple structure whereby an agent visiting a node should reduce
the uncertainty state to zero before moving to the next node. Simulation
examples are included to illustrate our results and compare them to optimal
solutions derived through dynamic programming when this is possible.

genomic data from across all life, leading to the possibility that a robust
Tree of Life can be constructed. However, ""gene tree heterogeneity"", which is
when different genomic regions can evolve differently, is a common phenomenon
in multi-locus datasets, and reduces the accuracy of standard methods for
species tree estimation that do not take this heterogeneity into account. New
methods have been developed for species tree estimation that specifically
address gene tree heterogeneity, and that have been proven to converge to the
true species tree when the number of loci and number of sites per locus both
increase (i.e., the methods are said to be ""statistically consistent""). Yet,
little is known about the biologically realistic condition where the number of
sites per locus is bounded. We show that when the sequence length of each locus
is bounded (by any arbitrarily chosen value), the most common approaches to
species tree estimation that take heterogeneity into account (i.e., traditional
fully partitioned concatenated maximum likelihood and newer approaches, called
summary methods, that estimate the species tree by combining gene trees) are
not statistically consistent, even when the heterogeneity is extremely
constrained. The main challenge is the presence of conditions such as long
branch attraction that create biased tree estimation when the number of sites
is restricted. Hence, our study uncovers a fundamental challenge to species
tree estimation using both traditional and new methods.

openings. These cave-like openings are theorized to be remnants of lava-tubes
and their interior maybe in pristine conditions. These locations may have well
preserved geological records of the Moon and Mars, including evidence of past
water flow and habitability. Exploration of these caves using wheeled rovers
remains a daunting challenge. These caves are likely to have entrances with
caved-in ceilings much like the lava-tubes of Arizona and New Mexico. Thus, the
entrances are nearly impossible to traverse even for experienced human hikers.
Our approach is to utilize the SphereX robot, a 3 kg, 30 cm diameter robot with
computer hardware and sensors of a smartphone attached to rocket thrusters.
Each SphereX robot can hop, roll or fly short distances in low gravity, airless
or low-pressure environments. Several SphereX robots maybe deployed to minimize
single-point failure and exploit cooperative behaviors to traverse the cave.
There are some important challenges for navigation and path planning in these
cave environments. Localization systems such as GPS are not available nor are
they easy to install due to the signal blockage from the rocks. These caves are
too dark and too large for conventional sensor such as cameras and miniature
laser sensors to perform detailed mapping and navigation. In this paper, we
identify new techniques to map these caves by performing localized, cooperative
mapping and navigation.

we explore how imitation-based or learning attitude and innovation-based or
myopic best response attitude compete for space in a complex model where both
attitudes are available. In the absence of additional cost the best response
trait practically dominates the whole snow-drift game parameter space which is
in agreement with the average payoff difference of basic models. When
additional cost is involved then the imitation attitude can gradually invade
the whole parameter space but this transition happens in a highly nontrivial
way. However, the role of competing attitudes is reversed in the stag-hunt
parameter space where imitation is more successful in general. Interestingly, a
four-state solution can be observed for the latter game which is a consequence
of an emerging cyclic dominance between possible states. These phenomena can be
understood by analyzing the microscopic invasion processes, which reveals the
unequal propagation velocities of strategies and attitudes.

radio emission is not well-understood. One hypothesis is that this radio
emission is a by-product of quasar-driven winds. In this paper, we present the
radio properties of 108 extremely red quasars (ERQs) at $z=2-4$. ERQs are among
the most luminous quasars ($L_{bol} \sim 10^{47-48}$ erg/s) in the Universe,
with signatures of extreme ($\gg 1000$ km/s) outflows in their
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 \AA\ emission, making them the best subjects to seek the
connection between radio and outflow activity. All ERQs but one are unresolved
in the radio on $\sim 10$ kpc scales, and the median radio luminosity of ERQs
is $\nu L_\nu [{\rm 6\,GHz}] = 10^{41.0}$ erg/s, in the radio-quiet regime, but
one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of other quasar samples. The
radio spectra are steep, with a mean spectral index $\langle \alpha \rangle =
-1.0$. In addition, ERQs neatly follow the extrapolation of the low-redshift
correlation between radio luminosity and the velocity dispersion of
[OIII]-emitting ionized gas. Uncollimated winds, with a power of one per cent
of the bolometric luminosity, can account for all these observations. Such
winds would interact with and shock the gas around the quasar and in the host
galaxy, resulting in acceleration of relativistic particles and the consequent
synchrotron emission observed in the radio. Our observations support the
picture in which ERQs are signposts of extremely powerful episodes of quasar
feedback, and quasar-driven winds as a contributor of the radio emission in the
intermediate regime of radio luminosity $\nu L_\nu = 10^{39}-10^{42}$ erg/s.

are independent of their masses and compositions, and restore exactly the

the universality of free-fall, may be deeply rooted in quantum physics and be a

inner stellar mass density profiles (within ~10-20 kpc) and more prominent
outer envelopes. These differences translate into a halo mass dependence of the
mass-size relation. Central galaxies in haloes with $\log M_{\rm{Halo}}>14.0$
are ~20% larger in $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed stellar mass. Such dependence is
also reflected in the relationship between the stellar mass within 10 and 100

consistent with the scenario that the molecular outflow is driven by multiple

are unlikely to disrupt due to their higher densities. After disruption, the
bulk of fragments undergo enough close passages to their host stars to lose
their surface volatiles and become extinct. Planetesimal fragments such as

multiple-component target shape usually leads the deformation flow to make the
boundary evolve until it surrounds all the components of the target shape. This
classical phenomenon tends to create double points on the boundary of the

in this paper a piecewise B\'ezier parameterization and we consider two

The first one allows to prevent potential collisions between two parts of the
boundary of the approximated shape, and the second one permits to change its
topology by dividing a one-component shape into a two-component shape. For an
experimental purpose, we include these two processes in a basic geometrical
shape optimization algorithm and test it on the classical inverse obstacle

However, prior to our work, there has been no framework that yields good
distance lattices directly from expanders. Interestingly, we need the notion of
high dimensional expansion (and not only one dimensional expansion) for
obtaining large distance lattices which are dense.
  Our construction is obtained by proving the existence of bounded degree high
dimensional cosystolic expanders over any ring, and in particular over
$\mathbb{Z}$. Previous bounded degree cosystolic expanders were known only over
$\mathbb{F}_2$. The proof of the cosystolic expansion over any ring is composed
of two main steps, each of an independent interest: We show that coboundary
expansion over any ring of the links of a bounded degree complex implies that
the complex is a cosystolic expander over any ring. We then prove that all the
links of Ramanujan complexes (which are called spherical buildings) are
coboundary expanders over any ring.
  We follow the strategy of [LMM16] for proving that the spherical building is
a coboundary expander over any ring. Besides of generalizing their proof from
$\mathbb{F}_2$ to any ring, we present it in a detailed way, which might serve

the helicity-dependent photocurrent generated within each Weyl node takes on a
universal value determined by the fundamental constants, the light frequency

excitation in a magnetic field. In quantized magnetic fields, the photocurrent
is caused by optical transitions between the one-dimensional magnetic subbands.

underlying layers remains one of the greatest challenge for solar modeling.
Detailed diagnostics of the coronal thermal structure come from extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) emission. The EUV emission is produced by heavy ions in
various ionization states and depends on the amount of these ions and on plasma
temperature and density. Any nonuniformity of the elemental distribution in
space or variability in time affects thermal diagnostics of the corona. Here we
theoretically predict ionized chemical element concentrations in some areas of
the solar atmosphere, where the electric current is directed upward. We then
detect these areas observationally, by comparing the electric current density
with the EUV brightness in an active region. We found a significant excess in
EUV brightness in the areas with positive current density rather than negative.
Therefore, we report the observational discovery of substantial concentrations
of heavy ions in current-carrying magnetic flux tubes, which might have
important implications for the elemental fractionation in the solar corona
known as the first ionization potential (FIP) effect. We call such areas of
heavy ion concentration the ""ion traps."" These traps hold enhanced ion levels

minimal degree of alignment (with the norms of conversation, for instance) when
it can go undetected when interrogated by a human. I carefully distinguish this
interpretation from the Moral Turing Test, which is not motivated by a
principle of fair play, but instead depends on imitation of human moral

radius inflation. They probe the regime where inflation begins to become
noticeable and are valuable in constraining planet inflation models. In
addition, the brightness of the host stars, combined with large atmospheric
scale heights of the planets, makes these two systems favorable targets for
transit spectroscopy to study their atmospheres and perhaps provide insight
into the physical mechanisms that lead to inflated hot Jupiters.

Cloud (SMC) with a heliocentric radial velocity of ~300 km/s which is much
larger than expected for a star in its location in the SMC. This is the first
runaway YSG ever discovered and only the second evolved runaway star discovered
in a different galaxy than the Milky Way. We classify the star as G5-8I, and
use de-reddened broad-band colors with model atmospheres to determine an
effective temperature of 4700+/-250K, consistent with what is expected from its
spectral type. The star's luminosity is then L/Lo ~ 4.2+/-0.1, consistent with
it being a ~30Myr 9Mo star according to the Geneva evolution models. The star
is currently located in the outer portion of the SMC's body, but if the star's
transverse peculiar velocity is similar to its peculiar radial velocity, in
10Myr the star would have moved 1.6 degrees across the disk of the SMC, and
could easily have been born in one of the SMC's star-forming regions. Based on
its large radial velocity, we suggest it originated in a binary system where
the primary exploded as a supernovae thus flinging the runaway star out into
space. Such stars may provide an important mechanism for the dispersal of
heavier elements in galaxies given the large percentage of massive stars that
are runaways. In the future we hope to look into additional evolved runaway
stars that were discovered as part of our other past surveys.

the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions; $\Delta S = \left

charged particles relative to the reaction plane and averages are event-wise,
and $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ is a normalized event probability distribution.
Preliminary STAR data reveal concave $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ distributions in
200 GeV Au+Au collisions. Studies with a multiphase transport (AMPT) and
anomalous-viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) models show concave $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta
S)$ distributions for CME signals and convex ones for typical resonance
backgrounds. A recent hydrodynamic study, however, indicates concave shapes for
backgrounds as well. To better understand these results, we report a systematic
study of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and transverse momentum ($p_{T}$)
dependences of resonance backgrounds with toy-model simulations and central
limit theorem (CLT) calculations. It is found that the concavity or convexity
of $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ depends sensitively on the resonance $v_2$ (which
yields different numbers of decay $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs in the in-plane and
out-of-plane directions) and $p_T$ (which affects the opening angle of the
decay $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair). Qualitatively, low $p_{T}$ resonances decay into
large opening-angle pairs and result in more `back-to-back' pairs out-of-plane,
mimicking a CME signal, or a concave $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$. Supplemental
studies of $R_{\Psi_3}(\Delta S)$ in terms of the triangular flow ($v_3$),
where only backgrounds exist but any CME would average to zero, are also
presented.

important unresolved problem which requires tuning in practice. If certain
parameters of the loss function such as smoothness or strong convexity
constants are known, theoretical learning rate schedules can be applied.
However, in practice, such parameters are not known, and the loss function of
interest is not convex in any case. The recently proposed batch normalization
reparametrization is widely adopted in most neural network architectures today
because, among other advantages, it is robust to the choice of Lipschitz
constant of the gradient in loss function, allowing one to set a large learning
rate without worry. Inspired by batch normalization, we propose a general
nonlinear update rule for the learning rate in batch and stochastic gradient
descent so that the learning rate can be initialized at a high value, and is
subsequently decreased according to gradient observations along the way. The
proposed method is shown to achieve robustness to the relationship between the
learning rate and the Lipschitz constant, and near-optimal convergence rates in
both the batch and stochastic settings ($O(1/T)$ for smooth loss in the batch
setting, and $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for convex loss in the stochastic setting). We
also show through numerical evidence that such robustness of the proposed
method extends to highly nonconvex and possibly non-smooth loss function in
deep learning problems.Our analysis establishes some first theoretical
understanding into the observed robustness for batch normalization and weight
normalization.

""Superbubble"", as well as in the immediate vicinity. The measurements at
frequencies between 4.33 and 7.76 GHz yield Faraday rotation measures along 27
lines of sight to these sources (some sources have more than one component).
The Faraday rotation measures (RM) are used to probe the plasma structure of
the IC 1805 HII region and to test the degree to which the Galactic magnetic
field is heavily modified (amplified) by the dynamics of the HII region. We
find that similar to the Rosette Nebula (Savage et al. 2013, Costa et al. 2016)
and the Cygnus OB1 association (Whiting et al. 2009), IC 1805 constitutes a
""Faraday rotation anomaly"", or a region of increased RM relative to the general
Galactic background value. Although the RM observed on lines of sight through
the region vary substantially, the |RM| due to the nebula is commonly 600 --
800 rad m^-2. In spite of this, the observed RMs are not as large as simple,
analytic models of magnetic field amplification in HII regions might indicate.
This suggests that the Galactic field is not increased by a substantial factor
within the ionized gas in an HII region. We also find that with one exception,
the sign of the RM for all sources is that expected for the polarity of the
Galactic field in this direction. The same behavior was found for the Rosette
Nebula, and qualitatively indicates that turbulent fluctuations in the Galactic
field on spatial scales of $\sim 10$ pc are smaller than the mean Galactic
field. Finally, our results show intriguing indications that some of the
largest values of |RM| occur for lines of sight that pass outside the fully
ionized shell of the IC 1805 HII region, but pass through the Photodissociation
Region (PDR) associated with IC 1805.

objects, such as user-movie ratings, protein-drug bindings, or ternary

is a matrix (or a higher-dimensional tensor) with an exchangeability property:
the encoding's meaning is not changed by permuting rows or columns. We argue
that models should hence be Permutation Equivariant (PE): constrained to make
the same predictions across such permutations. We present a parameter-sharing

violating PE. This scheme yields three benefits. First, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance on multiple matrix completion benchmarks. Second,
our models require a number of parameters independent of the numbers of
objects, and thus scale well to large datasets. Third, models can be queried
about new objects that were not available at training time, but for which
interactions have since been observed. In experiments, our models achieved
surprisingly good generalization performance on this matrix extrapolation task,
both within domains (e.g., new users and new movies drawn from the same

gravitational-wave events a reality. These joint detections allow us to probe
gravitational-wave sources in greater detail and provide us with the
possibility of confidently establishing events that would not have been
detected in gravitational-wave data alone. In this paper, we explore the
prospects of using the electromagnetic follow-up of low-significance
gravitational-wave event candidates to increase the sample of confident
detections with electromagnetic counterparts. We find that the
gravitational-wave alert threshold change that would roughly double the number
of detectable astrophysical events would increase the false-alarm rate by more
than 5 orders of magnitude from 1 per 100 years to more than 1000 per year. We
find that the localization costs of following-up low-significance candidates
are marginal, as the same changes to false-alarm rate only increase
distance/area localizations by less than a factor of 2 and increase volume
localization by less than a factor of 4. We argue that EM follow-up thresholds
for low-significance candidates should be set on the basis of alert purity
($P_\text{astro}$) and not false-alarm rate. Ideally, such estimates of
$P_\text{astro}$ would be provided by LIGO-Virgo, but in their absence we
provide estimates of the average purity of the gravitational-wave candidate
alerts issued by LIGO-Virgo as a function of false-alarm rate for various

aspects that are difficult to be identified and quantified. For this reason,
their exploration is frequently conducted through the collection of ordinal
evidence in the form of ranking data. A ranking is an ordered sequence
resulting from the comparative evaluation of a given set of items according to
a specific criterion. Multistage ranking models, including the popular
Plackett-Luce distribution (PL), rely on the assumption that the ranking
process is performed sequentially, by assigning the positions from the top to
the bottom one (forward order). A recent contribution to the ranking literature
relaxed this assumption with the addition of the discrete reference order
parameter, yielding the novel Extended Plackett-Luce model (EPL). Inference on
the EPL and its generalization into a finite mixture framework was originally
addressed from the frequentist perspective. In this work, we propose the
Bayesian estimation of the EPL with order constraints on the reference order
parameter. The restrictions for the discrete parameter reflect a meaningful
rank assignment process and, in combination with the data augmentation strategy
and the conjugacy of the Gamma prior distribution with the EPL, facilitate the
construction of a tuned joint Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within Gibbs
sampling to simulate from the posterior distribution. We additionally propose a
novel model diagnostic to assess the adequacy of the EPL parametric
specification. The usefulness of the proposal is illustrated with applications
to simulated and real datasets.

mechanical entanglement as compared to that exhibited by other theories? The
first part of this thesis deals with these questions by considering quantum
theory as part of a wider landscape of physical theories, collectively called
general probabilistic theories (GPTs). Among the other things, this manuscript
contains a detailed introduction to the abstract state space formalism for
GPTs. We start with a comprehensive review of the proof of a famous theorem by
Ludwig that constitutes one of its cornerstones (Ch. 1). After explaining the
basic rules of the game, we translate our questions into precise conjectures
and present our progress toward a full solution (Ch. 2). In Ch. 3 we consider
entanglement at the level of measurements instead of states, focusing on one of
its main implications, i.e. data hiding. We determine the maximal data hiding
strength that a quantum mechanical system can exhibit, and also the maximum
value among all GPTs, finding that the former scales as the square root of the
latter. In the second part of this manuscript we look into quantum
entanglement. In Ch. 4 we discuss the entanglement transformation properties of
a class of maps that model white noise acting either locally or globally on a
bipartite system. In Ch. 5 we employ matrix analysis tools to develop a unified
approach to Gaussian entanglement. The third part of this thesis concerns more
general forms of non-classical correlations in bipartite continuous variable
systems. In Ch. 6 we devise a general scheme that allows to consistently
classify correlations of bipartite Gaussian states into classical and quantum
ones. Finally, Ch. 7 explores some problems connected with a certain strong

matter particles that elastically scatter from nuclei in semiconductor
detectors. The resulting nuclear-recoil energy depositions are detected by
ionization and phonon sensors. Neutrons produce a similar spectrum of
low-energy nuclear recoils in such detectors, while most other backgrounds
produce electron recoils. The absolute energy scale for nuclear recoils is
necessary to interpret results correctly. The energy scale can be determined in
CDMS II silicon detectors using neutrons incident from a broad-spectrum
$^{252}$Cf source, taking advantage of a prominent resonance in the neutron
elastic scattering cross section of silicon at a recoil (neutron) energy near
20 (182) keV. Results indicate that the phonon collection efficiency for
nuclear recoils is $4.8^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$% lower than for electron recoils of the
same energy. Comparisons of the ionization signals for nuclear recoils to those
measured previously by other groups at higher electric fields indicate that the
ionization collection efficiency for CDMS II silicon detectors operated at
$\sim$4 V/cm is consistent with 100% for nuclear recoils below 20 keV and
gradually decreases for larger energies to $\sim$75% at 100 keV. The impact of
these measurements on previously published CDMS II silicon results is small.

dipolar Heisenberg model on square lattice. This model is similar to the well
known $J_1$-$J_2$ model and describes the pseudospin degrees of freedom of
polar molecules confined in deep optical lattice with long-range anisotropic
dipole-dipole interactions. Previous study of this model based on tensor
network ansatz indicates a paramagnetic ground state for certain dipole tilting
angles which can be tuned in experiments to control the exchange couplings. The
tensor ansatz formulated on a small cluster unit cell is inadequate to describe
the spiral order, and therefore the phase diagram at high azimuthal tilting
angles remains undetermined. Here we obtain the full phase diagram of the model
from numerical pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. We
show that an extended quantum paramagnetic phase is realized between the
N\'{e}el and stripe/spiral phase. In this region, the spin susceptibility flows
smoothly down to the lowest numerical renormalization group scales with no sign
of divergence or breakdown of the flow, in sharp contrast to the flow towards
the long-range ordered phases. Our results provide further evidence that the
dipolar Heisenberg model is a fertile ground for quantum spin liquids.

cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. The interference of tissue-resident
immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve fibres which affects
the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic
tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male
Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected
on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes
and DRG tissues for immunofluorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA
quantification. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli
were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat
cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identified on day 6.
Immunofluorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14
and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the
same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14.
TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of
HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a
promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of
TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined.

at simultaneously estimating a binary matrix (encoding presence or absence of
mutations in each strain) and a real-valued vector (representing the mixture of
strains) such that their product is approximately equal to the measured data
vector. The problem at hand has a similar structure to blind deconvolution,

present two computational methods for solving the non-convex maximum a
posteriori estimation problem. The first one is a local optimization method
that is made efficient and scalable by decoupling the problem into smaller
independent subproblems, whereas the second one yields a global minimizer by
converting the problem into a convex mixed-integer quadratic programming
problem. The decoupling approach also provides an efficient way to integrate
over the posterior. This provides useful information about the ambiguity of the

performs the reaction part of a discrete stochastic reaction-diffusion system
when we insert a local Mexican Hat-type, difference of Gaussians, coupling on a
one-dimensional and on a two-dimensional lattice. Quasi-cycles are a proposed
mechanism for the production of neural oscillations, and Mexican Hat coupling
is ubiquitous in the brain. Thus this combination might provide insight into
the function of neural oscillations in the brain. Importantly, we study this

In one dimension, for weak coupling, we find that the phases of the coupled
quasi-cycles synchronize (establish a relatively constant relationship, or
phase lock) rapidly at coupling strengths lower than those required to produce
spatial patterns of their amplitudes. In two dimensions the amplitude patterns
form more quickly, but there remain parameter regimes in which phase
synchronization patterns form without being accompanied by clear amplitude
patterns. At higher coupling strengths we find patterns both of phase
synchronization and of amplitude (resembling Turing patterns) corresponding to
the patterns of phase synchronization. Specific properties of these patterns
are controlled by the parameters of the reaction and of the Mexican Hat
coupling.

involve fitting high dimensional labelled data sets with functions containing
very large numbers of parameters. Much of this work is empirical. Interesting
phenomena have been observed that require theoretical explanations; however the
non-convexity of the loss functions complicates the analysis. Recently it has
been proposed that the success of these techniques rests partly in the
effectiveness of the simple stochastic gradient descent algorithm in the so
called interpolation limit in which all labels are fit perfectly. This analysis
is made possible since the SGD algorithm reduces to a stochastic linear system
near the interpolating minimum of the loss function. Here we exploit this
insight by presenting and analyzing a new distributed algorithm for gradient
descent, also in the interpolating limit. The distributed SGD algorithm
presented in the paper corresponds to gradient descent applied to a simple
penalized distributed loss function, $L({\bf w}_1,...,{\bf w}_n) = \Sigma_i
l_i({\bf w}_i) + \mu \sum_{<i,j>}|{\bf w}_i-{\bf w}_j|^2$. Here each node holds
only one sample, and its own parameter vector. The notation $<i,j>$ denotes
edges of a connected graph defining the links between nodes. It is shown that
this distributed algorithm converges linearly (ie the error reduces
exponentially with iteration number), with a rate
$1-\frac{\eta}{n}\lambda_{min}(H)<R<1$ where $\lambda_{min}(H)$ is the smallest
nonzero eigenvalue of the sample covariance or the Hessian H. In contrast with
previous usage of similar penalty functions to enforce consensus between nodes,
in the interpolating limit it is not required to take the penalty parameter to
infinity for consensus to occur. The analysis further reinforces the utility of
the interpolation limit in the theoretical treatment of modern machine learning
algorithms.

means of a limiting process. These generalized derivatives include, as a
special case, the classical derivative and current studies of fractional
differential operators. All such operators satisfy properties such as the sum,
product/quotient rules, chain rule, etc. We study a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue
problem with generalized derivatives and show that the general case is actually
a consequence of standard Sturm-Liouville Theory. As an application of the
developments herein we find the general solution of a generalized harmonic
oscillator. We also consider the classical problem of a planar motion under a
central force and show that the general solution of this problem is still
generically an ellipse, and that this result is true independently of the
choice of the generalized derivatives being used modulo a time shift. The
previous result on the generic nature of phase plane orbits is extended to the
classical gravitational n-body problem of Newton to show that the global nature
of these orbits is independent of the choice of the generalized derivatives
being used in defining the force law (modulo a time shift). Finally,
restricting the generalized derivatives to a special class of fractional
derivatives, we consider the question of motion under gravity with and without
resistance and arrive at a new notion of time that depends on the fractional
parameter. The results herein are meant to clarify and extend many known
results in the literature and intended to show the limitations and use of
generalized derivatives and corresponding fractional derivatives.

carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the lowest triplet
($T_1$) potential-energy surfaces (PES) upon lengthening the iridium-ligand

that this changes the nature of $T_1$ from a highly-emissive metal-to-ligand
charge transfer ($^3$MLCT) state to a metal centered ($^3$MC) state where the
radiative decay rate is orders of magnitude slower than that of the $^3$MLCT
state. We identify the elongation of an Ir-C bond on the NHC group as the
pathway with lowest energy barrier between the $^3$MLCT and $^3$MC states for
all complexes studied and show that the barrier height is correlated with the
experimentally measured non-radiative decay rate. This suggests that the
thermal population of $^3$MC states is the dominant non-radiative decay
mechanism at room temperature. We show that the $^3$MLCT $\rightarrow$ $^3$MC
transition is reversible, in marked contrast to other deep blue phosphors
containing coordinating nitrogen atoms, where the population of $^3$MC states
breaks Ir-N bonds. This suggests that, as well as improved efficiency, blue
PHOLEDs containing phosphors where the metal is only coordinated by carbon
atoms will have improved device lifetimes.

highlighted various forms of abuse that allow malware authors to produce
malicious code carrying valid digital signatures. However, the underground
trade that allows miscreants to acquire such certificates is not well
understood. In this paper, we illuminate two aspects of this trade. First, we
investigate 4 leading vendors of Authenticode certificates, we document how
they conduct business, and we estimate their market share. Second, we collect a
data set of recently signed malware and we use it to study the relationships
among malware developers, malware families and the certificates. We also use
information from the black market to fingerprint the certificates traded and to
identify when the are likely used to sign malware in the wild. Using these
methods, we document a shift in the methods that malware authors employ to
obtain valid digital signatures. While prior studies have reported the use of
code-signing certificates that had been compromised or obtained directly from
legitimate Certification Authorities, we observe that, in 2017, these methods
have become secondary to purchasing certificates from underground vendors. We
also find that the need to bypass platform protections such as Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen plays a growing role in driving the demand for
Authenticode certificates. Together, these findings suggest that the trade in
certificates issued for abuse represents an emerging segment of the underground
economy.

Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison [arXiv:1210.6437v4]:
  Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a reductive Lie algebra, and $A$ an algebra, both over
$\mathbb{C}$. Consider a $(\mathfrak{g} , A)$-bimodule $P$ in which
  (a) $P$ has a multiplicity free decomposition into irreducible $(\mathfrak{g}

  (b) $P$ is ""saturated"" i.e. for any irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$, if
every weight of $V$ is a weight of $P$, then $V$ is a submodule of $P$.
  We show that statements (a) and (b) are necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of an isomorphism of categories between the full subcategory
of $\mathcal{R}ep A$ whose objects are $\mathfrak{g}$-weight spaces of $P$, and
a quotient of the category version of Lusztig's idempotented form,
$\dot{{\mathcal{U}}} \mathfrak{g}$, formed by setting to zero all morphisms
factoring through a collection of objects in $\dot{{\mathcal{U}}} \mathfrak{g}$
depending on $P$. This is essentially a categorical version of the
identification of generalized Schur algebras with quotients of Lusztig's
idempotented forms given by Doty in [arXiv:math/0305208].
  Applied to Schur-Weyl Duality we obtain a diagrammatic presentation of the
full subcategory of $\mathcal{R}ep S_d$ whose objects are direct sums of
permutation modules, as well as an explicit description of the
$\otimes$-product of morphisms between permutation modules. Applied to

(Sr) can induce superconductivity, making the doped materials interesting
candidates to explore potential topological superconducting behaviors. It was
thought that the superconductivity of doped Bi2Se3 was induced by dopant atoms
intercalated in van der Waals gaps. However, several experiments have shown
that the intercalation of dopant atoms may not necessarily make doped Bi2Se3
superconducting. Thus, the structural origin of superconductivity in doped
Bi2Se3 remains an open question. Herein, we combined material synthesis and
characterization, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and
first-principles calculations to study the doping structure of Sr-doped Bi2Se3.
We found that the emergence of superconductivity is strongly related with
n-type dopant atoms. Atomic-level energy-dispersive X-ray mapping revealed
various n-type Sr dopants that occupy intercalated and interstitial positions.
First-principles calculations showed that the formation energy of a specific
interstitial Sr doping position depends strongly on Sr doping level. This site
changes from a metastable position at low Sr doping level to a stable position
at high Sr doping level. The calculation results explain why quenching is
necessary to obtain superconducting samples when the Sr doping level is low and
also why slow furnace cooling can yield superconducting samples when the Sr
doping level is high. Our findings suggest that Sr atoms doped at interstitial
locations, instead of those intercalated in van der Waals gaps, are most likely
to be responsible for the emergence of superconductivity in Sr-doped Bi2Se3.

Balanced Index (BI), is fast to compute and assigns top values to two kinds of
nodes: those with high resistance to adoption, and those with large out-degree.
This is done by linearly combining three properties of a node: its degree,
susceptibility to new opinions, and the impact its activation will have on its
neighborhood. Controlling the weights between those three terms has a huge
impact on performance. The second metric, termed Group Performance Index (GPI),
measures performance of each node as an initiator when it is a part of randomly
selected initiator set. In each such selection, the score assigned to each
teammate is inversely proportional to the number of initiators causing the
desired spread. These two metrics are applicable to various cascade models;
here we test them on the Linear Threshold Model with fixed and known

this paper examine whether the time horizon of the predictive effect of
investor sentiment on the U.S. returns of stocks vary with different firm
characteristics (e.g., firm size (Size), book-to-market equity (B/M) rate,
operating profitability (OP) and investment (Inv)). The empirical results
indicate that investor sentiment has a long-term (more than 12 months) or
short-term (less than 12 months) predictive effect on stock returns with
different firm characteristics. Specifically, the investor sentiment has strong
predictability in the stock returns for smaller Size stocks, lower B/M stocks

short-term predictability for higher quantile ones. The investor sentiment
merely has predictability for the returns of smaller Inv stocks in the short

When the La doping exceeds 0.036, topological Hall effect emerges, which we
attribute to the formation of magnetic skyrmions. Besides, the La doping is
found to play a critical role in determining the phases, densities, and sizes
of the skyrmions in the LaxEu1-xO thin films. The maximum region of the
skyrmion phase diagram is observed on the La0.1Eu0.9O thin film. As the La

uniform spin configuration in the momentum space. This property has been
predicted to support an extraordinarily long spin lifetime of carriers
promising for spintronics applications. The PST is known to emerge when the
strengths of two dominant spin-orbit couplings, the Rashba and linear
Dresselhaus, are equal. This condition, however, is not trivial to achieve and
requires tuning the Rashba and Dresselhaus parameters, as has been demonstrated
with semiconductor quantum-well structures. Here we predict that there exist a
class of non-centrosymmetric bulk materials where the PST is enforced by the
non-symmorphic space group symmetry of the crystal. Around certain high
symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, the sublattice degrees of freedom impose
a constraint on the effective spin-orbit field, which remains independent of
the momentum orientation and thus maintains the PST. We illustrate this
behavior using density-functional theory calculations for a handful of
promising candidates accessible experimentally. Among them is the ferroelectric
oxide BiInO3-a wide band gap semiconductor which sustains a PST around the
conduction band minimum. Our results broaden the range of materials, which can
be employed in spintronics.

on supervised learning has shown promising results for practical applications.
However, a particular drawback of such methods is that it requires training
image sets with similar information content which may not always be available.
In this paper, we introduce a Supervised Learning Approach for Dynamic Sampling
(SLADS) algorithm that uses a deep neural network based training approach. We
call this algorithm SLADS- Net. We have performed simulated experiments for
dynamic sampling using SLADS-Net in which the training images either have
similar information content or completely different information content, when
compared to the testing images. We compare the performance across various
methods for training such as least- squares, support vector regression and deep
neural networks. From these results we observe that deep neural network based
training results in superior performance when the training and testing images
are not similar. We also discuss the development of a pre-trained SLADS-Net
that uses generic images for training. Here, the neural network parameters are
pre-trained so that users can directly apply SLADS-Net for imaging experiments.

are intimately connected. For example, the co-expression of a large number of
genes can benefit from their spatial co-localization in the cellular space.
Furthermore, functional structures can result from the particular folding of
the chromosome. Such phenomena have in common to result from the binding of
divalent proteins that can bridge regions sometimes far away on the DNA
sequence. The physical system consisting of the chromosome interacting with
divalent proteins can be very complex. As such, most of the mechanisms
responsible for chromosome folding and for the formation of functional
structures have remained elusive.
  Using methods from statistical physics, we investigated models of chromosome
architecture. A common denominator of our approach has been to represent the
chromosome as a polymer with bending rigidity and consider its interaction with
a solution of DNA-binding proteins. Structures entailed by the binding of such
proteins were then characterized at the thermodynamical equilibrium.
Furthermore, we complemented theoretical results with Brownian dynamics
simulations, allowing to reproduce more of the biological complexity.
  The main contributions of this thesis have been: (i) to provide a model for
the existence of transcription factories characterized in vivo with
fluorescence microscopy; (ii) to propose a physical basis for a conjectured
regulatory mechanism of the transcription involving the formation of DNA
hairpin loops by the H-NS protein as characterized with atomic-force microscopy
experiments; (iii) to propose a physical model of the chromosome that
reproduces contacts measured in chromosome conformation capture (CCC)
experiments. Consequences on the regulation of transcription are discussed in
each of these studies.

for large-scale image retrieval. Recently, many deep hashing methods have been
proposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional
feature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise
similarity on the semantic-level labels, where the pairwise similarity is
generally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is, the pairwise similarity is
'1' if they share no less than one class label and '0' if they do not share
any. However, such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking
for pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper, a new deep
hashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the
pairwise similarity into an instance similarity, where the instance similarity
is quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based
on the instance similarity, a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean
square error loss are tailored for loss-function construction, and are
efficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding. Experiments
on three popular datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method outperforms the
competing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-label
image retrieval.

extragalactic background light. We present analytical and numerical
calculations of the linear growth rate of the instability for arbitrary
orientation of wave vectors. Our results explicitly demonstrate that the finite
angular spread of the beam dramatically affects the growth rate of the waves,
leading to fastest growth for wave vectors quasi-parallel to the beam direction
and a growth rate at oblique directions that is only by a factor of 2-4 smaller
compared to the maximum. To study the non-linear beam relaxation, we performed
PIC simulations that take into account a realistic wide-energy distribution of
beam particles. The parameters of the simulated beam-plasma system provide an
adequate physical picture that can be extrapolated to realistic blazar-induced
pairs. In our simulations the beam looses only 1\% percent of its energy, and
we analytically estimate that the beam would lose its total energy over about
$100$ simulation times. Analytical scaling is then used to extrapolate to the
parameters of realistic blazar-induced pair beams. We find that they can
dissipate their energy slightly faster by the electrostatic instability than
through inverse-Compton scattering. The uncertainties arising from, e.g.,
details of the primary gamma-ray spectrum are too large to make firm statements
for individual blazars, and an analysis based on their specific properties is

prism is a typical structure respecting these symmetries, where six topological
hinge states emerge at the side. The building block is a hexagon in two
dimensions, where topological corner states emerge at the six corners in the

interaction is strong and weak, respectively. They are characterized by the

reduce computational and storage costs in the image retrieval research, this
paper argues that binary visual representations can be applied to large scale
recognition and detection problems in addition to hashing in retrieval.
Furthermore, the binary nature may make it generalize better than its
real-valued counterparts. Existing binary hashing methods are either two-stage
or hinging on loss term regularization or saturated functions, hence converge
slowly and only emit soft binary values. This paper proposes Approximately
Binary Clamping (ABC), which is non-saturating, end-to-end trainable, with fast
convergence and can output true binary visual representations. ABC achieves
comparable accuracy in ImageNet classification as its real-valued counterpart,
and even generalizes better in object detection. On benchmark image retrieval
datasets, ABC also outperforms existing hashing methods.

  equations",,,,,"math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We introduce and analyze a post-processing for a family of variational
space-time approximations to wave problems. The discretization in space and
time is based on continuous finite element methods. The post-processing lifts
the fully discrete approximations in time from continuous to continuously
differentiable ones. Further, it increases the order of convergence of the
discretization in time which can be be exploited nicely, for instance, for
a-posteriori error control. The convergence behavior is shown by proving error
estimates of optimal order in various norms. A bound of superconvergence at the
discrete times nodes is included. To show the error estimates, a special
approach is developed. Firstly, error estimates for the time derivative of the
post-processed solution are proved. Then, in a second step these results are
used to establish the desired error estimates for the post-processed solution
itself. The need for this approach comes through the structure of the wave
equation providing only stability estimates that preclude us from using
absorption arguments for the control of certain error quantities. A further key
ingredient of this work is the construction of a new time-interpolate of the
exact solution that is needed in an essential way for deriving the error
estimates. Finally, a conservation of energy property is shown for the
post-processed solution which is a key feature for approximation schemes to
wave equations. The error estimates given in this work are confirmed by
numerical experiments.

a long-standing problem. Here, we present a new transport equation and its
solutions, which yield a unified quantitative explanation of the mean square

explains not only the MSD and NGP, but also the time-dependent relaxation of
the displacement distribution for various systems. We introduce the concepts of
intrinsic disorder and extrinsic disorder that have distinct effects on
transport dynamics and different dependencies on temperature and density. This
work presents a new paradigm for quantitative understanding of transport and

entirely handled by sub-grid algorithms, computational power now allows the
accretion radius of such objects to be resolved in smaller scale simulations.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of resolution on two commonly used
SMBH sub-grid algorithms; the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) formula for accretion
onto a point mass, and the related estimate of the drag force exerted onto a
point mass by a gaseous medium. We find that when the accretion region around
the black hole scales with resolution, and the BHL formula is evaluated using
local mass-averaged quantities, the accretion algorithm smoothly transitions
from the analytic BHL formula (at low resolution) to a supply limited accretion
(SLA) scheme (at high resolution). However, when a similar procedure is
employed to estimate the drag force it can lead to significant errors in its
magnitude, and/or apply this force in the wrong direction in highly resolved
simulations. At high Mach numbers and for small accretors, we also find
evidence of the advective-acoustic instability operating in the adiabatic case,
and of an instability developing around the wake's stagnation point in the
quasi-isothermal case. Moreover, at very high resolution, and Mach numbers
above $\mathcal{M}_\infty \geq 3$, the flow behind the accretion bow shock
becomes entirely dominated by these instabilities. As a result, accretion rates
onto the black hole drop by about an order of magnitude in the adiabatic case,
compared to the analytic BHL formula.

main novelty of this work is the abstraction of a neuromorphic architecture
into clusters represented by minicolumns and hypercolumns, analogously to the
fundamental structural units observed in neurobiology. Without this approach,
simulating large-scale fully connected networks needs prohibitively large
memory to store look-up tables for point-to-point connections. Instead, we use
a novel architecture, based on the structural connectivity in the neocortex,
such that all the required parameters and connections can be stored in on-chip
memory. The cortex simulator can be easily reconfigured for simulating
different neural networks without any change in hardware structure by
programming the memory. A hierarchical communication scheme allows one neuron
to have a fan-out of up to 200k neurons. As a proof-of-concept, an
implementation on one Altera Stratix V FPGA was able to simulate 20 million to
2.6 billion leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons in real time. We verified
the system by emulating a simplified auditory cortex (with 100 million
neurons). This cortex simulator achieved a low power dissipation of 1.62 {\mu}W
per neuron. With the advent of commercially available FPGA boards, our system
offers an accessible and scalable tool for the design, real-time simulation,

extreme multi-class classification where labels (items) corresponding to the

adaptation setting, in which a classifier trained in the source domain is
adapted to the target domain. For this, we construct a neural network that
combines an architecture for domain adaptation, Domain Separation Network, with
a denoising autoencoder for item representation. We assess the performance of

collectivity and efficiently check the correctness of Boolean predicates on the
structure of the network, or on data-structures distributed over the nodes
(e.g., spanning trees or routing tables). We consider mechanisms consisting of
two components: a \emph{prover} assigning a \emph{certificate} to each node,
and a distributed algorithm called \emph{verifier} that is in charge of
verifying the distributed proof formed by the collection of all certificates.
  In this paper, we show that many network predicates have distributed proofs
offering a high level of redundancy, explicitly or implicitly. We use this
remarkable property of distributed proofs for establishing perfect tradeoffs
between the \emph{size of the certificate} stored at every node, and the
\emph{number of rounds} of the verification protocol. If we allow every node to
communicate to distance at most $t$, one might expect that the certificate
sizes can be reduced by a multiplicative factor of at least~$t$. In trees,
cycles and grids, we show that such tradeoffs can be established for \emph{all}
network predicates, i.e., it is always possible to linearly decrease the
certificate size. In arbitrary graphs, we show that any part of the
certificates common to all nodes can be evenly redistributed among these nodes,
achieving even a better tradeoff: this common part of the certificate can be
reduced by the size of a smallest ball of radius $t$ in the network.
  In addition to these general results, we establish several upper and lower
bounds on the certificate sizes used for distributed proofs for spanning trees,
minimum-weight spanning trees, diameter, additive and multiplicative spanners,
and more, improving and generalizing previous results from the literature.

structure of the subsonic part of the outflow of Galactic WR stars, in
particular of the WNE subclass; our focus is on the conditions at the sonic

stars adopting outer boundaries at the sonic point. We find that the outflows
of our models are accelerated to supersonic velocities by the radiative force
from opacity bumps either at temperatures of the order of 200kK by the Fe
opacity bump or of the order of 50kK by the HeII opacity bump. For a given
mass-loss rate, the conditions in the subsonic part of the outflow are
independent from the detailed physical conditions in the supersonic part. The
close proximity to the Eddington limit at the sonic point allows us to
construct a Sonic HR diagram, relating the sonic point temperature to the L/M
ratio and the stellar mass-loss rate, thereby constraining the sonic point
conditions, the subsonic structure, and the stellar wind mass-loss rates from
observations. The minimum mass-loss rate necessary to have the flow accelerated
to supersonic velocities by the Fe opacity bump is derived. A comparison of the
observed parameters of Galactic WNE stars to this minimum mass-loss rate
indicates that their winds are launched to supersonic velocities by the
radiation pressure arising from the Fe-bump. Conversely, models which do not
show transonic flows from the Fe opacity bump form inflated envelopes. We
derive an analytic criterion for the appearance of envelope inflation in the

the magnitude of the disturbances. The main contribution of the letter is the
methodology used for obtaining a valid ISSf-CBF, given a control barrier

the proper parameter regimes, the considered lattices bear connections to
models beyond one spatial dimension, namely the so-called zigzag lattice, as
well as the two-dimensional square lattice. We examine initially the
persistence conditions of the system, in order to seek for vortex-like
waveforms. Although this approach provides useful insights, due to the
degeneracy of these solutions, it does not allow us to determine if they
constitute true solutions of our system. In order to overcome this obstacle, we
follow a different route. In the case of the zigzag configuration, by means of
a Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition, we are able to establish that the bifurcation
equation for our model can be considered, in the small energy and small
coupling regime, as a perturbation of a corresponding non-local discrete
nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NL-dNLS) equation. There, nonexistence results of
degenerate phase-shift discrete solitons can be demonstrated by exploiting the
expansion of a suitable density current of the NL-dNLS, obtained in recent
literature. Finally, briefly considering a one-dimensional model bearing
similarities to the square lattice, we conclude that the above strategy is not
efficient for the proof of the existence or nonexistence of vortices due to the
higher degeneracy of this configuration.

that a node may not be able to store all the IDs of its neighbours. These
algorithms are useful for large networks of small devices such as the Internet
of Things, for wireless or ad-hoc networks, and, in general, as memory
efficient algorithms. We introduce the Compact Message Passing(CMP) model;an
extension of the standard message passing model considered at a finer
granularity where a node can interleave reads and writes with internal
computations, using a port only once in a round. The interleaving is required
for meaningful computations due to the low memory requirement and is akin to a
distributed network with nodes executing streaming algorithms. Note that the
internal memory size upper bounds the message sizes and hence e.g. for
log-memory, the model is weaker than the Congest model; for such models our
algorithms will work directly too. We present early results in the CMP model
for nodes with log^2-memory. We introduce the concepts of local compact
functions and compact protocols and give solutions for some classic distributed

these to solve the open problem of compact preprocessing for the compact

formation of galaxies located in the infall cluster region of Abell 85 (A85).
This is achieved by studying the post-starburst galaxy population as tracer of
recent quenching. By measuring the equivalent width (EW) of the [OII] and
Hdelta spectral lines, we classify the galaxies in three groups: passive (PAS),
emission line (EL), and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies. The PSB galaxy
population represents about 4.5% of the full sample. Dwarf galaxies (Mr >
-18.0) account for about 70 - 80% of PSBs, which indicates that most of the
galaxies undergoing recent quenching are low-mass objects. Independently of the
environment, PSB galaxies are disk-like objects with g - r colour between the
blue ELs and the red PAS ones. The PSB and EL galaxies in low-density
environments show similar luminosities and local galaxy densities. The dynamics
and local galaxy density of the PSB population in high density environments are
shared with PAS galaxies. However, PSB galaxies inside A85 are at shorter
clustercentric radius than PAS and EL ones. The value of the EW(Hdelta) is
larger for those PSBs closer to the cluster centre. We propose two different
physical mechanisms producing PSB galaxies depending on the environment. In low
density environments, gas-rich minor mergers or accretions could produce the
PSB galaxies. For high density environments like A85, PSBs would be produced by
the removal of the gas reservoirs of EL galaxies by ram-pressure stripping when
they pass near to the cluster centre.

  at Fermi Energies",,,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Intermediate Mass Fragments emission probability from Projectile-Like
Fragment break-up in semi-peripheral reactions has been measured in collisions
of $^{124}$Xe projectiles with two different targets of $^{64}$Ni and $^{64}$Zn
at the laboratory energy of 35 \amev. The two colliding systems differ only for
the target atomic number Z and, consequently, for the Isospin $N/Z$ ratio. An
enhancement of Intermediate Mass Fragments production for the neutron rich
$^{64}$Ni target, with respect to the $^{64}$Zn, is found. In the case of one
Intermediate Mass Fragment emission, the contributions of the dynamical and
statistical emissions have been evaluated, showing that the increase of the
effect above is due to an enhancement of the dynamical emission probability,
especially for heavy IMFs (Z$\gtrsim$ 7). This proves an influence of the
target Isospin on inducing the dynamical fragment production from
Projectile-Like Fragment break-up. In addition, a comparison of the Xe+Ni,Zn
results with the previously studied $^{112,124}Sn+^{58,64}Ni$ systems is
discussed in order to investigate the influence of the projectile Isospin alone
and to disentangle between Isospin effects against system-size effects on the
emission probability. These comparisons suggest that the prompt-dynamical
emission is mainly ruled by the $N/Z$ content of, both, projectile and target;
for the cases here investigated, the influence of the system size on the
dynamical emission probability can be excluded.

electrons which do not participate in the bonding, form new energy states
located near the Fermi-level. Because of these additional bands, some ABNCNRs
exhibit metallic behavior, which is quite uncommon in armchair nanoribbons. Our
calculations reveal that the metallic behavior is observed for the following
passivation patterns: (i) when B atom from one edge, and N atom from another

(iii) when C atom from one edge, and N atom from another edge, are
unpassivated. Furthermore, spin-polarization is also observed for certain
passivation schemes, which is also quite uncommon for armchair nanoribbons.

effects from the collapsing dense molecular clouds to protostellar disks.
First, we re-formulated the cosmic-ray desorption rate by considering the
variations of desorption rate over the grain size distribution. We find that
the differential desorption of volatile species is amplified by the grains
larger than 0.1 $\mu$m, because larger grains are heated to a lower temperature
by cosmic-rays and hence more sensitive to the variations in binding energies.
As a result, atomic nitrogen N is $\sim$2 orders of magnitude more abundant
than CO; N$_2$H$^+$ also becomes a few times more abundant than HCO$^+$ due to
the increased gas-phase N$_2$. However, the changes in ionization fraction due
to freeze-out and desorption only have minor effects on the non-ideal MHD
diffusivities. Our chemical network confirms that the very small grains (VSGs:

Hall effect. In collapsing dense cores, a maximum ambipolar diffusion is
achieved when truncating the MRN size distribution at 0.1 $\mu$m, and for a
maximum Hall effect, the truncation occurs at 0.04 $\mu$m. We conclude that the
grain size distribution is crucial to the differential depletion between CO and
N$_2$ related molecules, as well as to the non-ideal MHD diffusivities in dense

emission line measurements and the estimated black hole masses. Quasars found
in LAMOST are mostly located at low-to-moderate redshifts, with a mean value of
1.5. The highest redshift observed in DR2 and DR3 is 5. We applied emission

years of decision making history at a large B2C company. We illustrate the

their modulations and mode composition, provides crucial insight into stellar
structure and pulsation. However, tiny modulations of the dominant radial-mode
pulsation were recently found to be very frequent, possibly ubiquitous in
Cepheids, which makes secondary modes difficult to detect and analyse, since
these modulations can easily mask the potentially weak secondary modes. The aim
of this study is to re-investigate the secondary mode content in the sample of
OGLE-III and -IV single-mode classical Cepheids using kernel regression with
adaptive kernel width for pre-whitening, instead of using a constant-parameter
model. This leads to a more precise removal of the modulated dominant
pulsation, and enables a more complete survey of secondary modes with
frequencies outside a narrow range around the primary. Our analysis reveals
that significant secondary modes occur more frequently among first overtone
Cepheids than previously thought. The mode composition appears significantly
different in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, suggesting a possible
dependence on chemical composition. In addition to the formerly identified
non-radial mode at $P_2 \approx 0.6\ldots 0.65 P_1$ (0.62-mode), and a cluster
of modes with near-primary frequency, we find two more candidate non-radial

which may represent the fundamental of the 0.62-mode, supposed to be the first
harmonic of an $l \in \{7,8, 9\}$ non-radial mode. The other new mode is at

developed natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) method. We find that,
in the framework of natural orbitals formalism, the Kondo screening mechanism
becomes transparent and simple, while the intrinsic structure of Kondo singlet
is clearly resolved. For a single impurity Kondo system, there exits a single
active natural orbital which screens the magnetic impurity dominantly. In the
perspective of entanglement, the magnetic impurity is entangled dominantly with
the active natural orbital, i.e., the subsystem formed by the active natural
orbital and the magnetic impurity basically disentangles from the remaining
system. We have also studied the structures of the active natural orbital
respectively projected into real space and momentum space. Moreover, the
dynamical properties, represented by one-particle Green's functions defined at
impurity site with active natural orbital, were obtained by using correction
vector method. In order to clarify the spatial extension of the Kondo screening
cloud, the concept of Kondo correlation energy was introduced. With this
concept we obtain a characteristic length scale beyond which the Kondo
screening cloud is hardly detected in experiment. Our numerical results
indicate that this characteristic length scale usually is just a few
nanometers, which interprets why it is difficult to detect the Kondo screening
cloud experimentally in a metal host.

polymer is nearly unchanged, however in an intermediate regime, the radius of

the limit of a strong field, the radius of gyration increases with field

increasing field strength, passes through a maximum and decreases again at high

Furthermore, half-metallicity can be achieved in some hole concentration

sky with very high duty cycle, generating large numbers of single-pulse
candidates. The abundance of false positives presents an intractable problem if
candidates are to be inspected by eye, making it a good application for
artificial intelligence (AI). We apply deep learning to single pulse
classification and develop a hierarchical framework for ranking events by their
probability of being true astrophysical transients. We construct a tree-like
deep neural network (DNN) that takes multiple or individual data products as
input (e.g. dynamic spectra and multi-beam detection information) and trains on
them simultaneously. We have built training and test sets using false-positive
triggers from real telescopes, along with simulated FRBs, and single pulses
from pulsars. Training of the DNN was independently done for two radio
telescopes: the CHIME Pathfinder, and Apertif on Westerbork. High accuracy and
recall can be achieved with a labelled training set of a few thousand events.
Even with high triggering rates, classification can be done very quickly on
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). That speed is essential for selective
voltage dumps or issuing real-time VOEvents. Next, we investigate whether
dedispersion back-ends could be completely replaced by a real-time DNN
classifier. It is shown that a single forward propagation through a moderate
convolutional network could be faster than brute-force dedispersion; but the
low signal-to-noise per pixel makes such a classifier sub-optimal for this
problem. Real-time automated classification may prove useful for bright,
unexpected signals, both now and in the era of radio astronomy when data
volumes and the searchable parameter spaces further outgrow our ability to
manually inspect the data, such as for SKA and ngVLA.

focus on logistic and ordinal models and on the important and difficult case
where the Riemannian manifold is the three-dimensional case of Kendall's shape

convenience depend on the properties (e.g. stationary distribution and hitting

unbiased random walks (TURW). In this paper, we present a new class of biased
random walks, non-backtracking centrality based random walks (NBCRW) on a

non-backtracking centrality that has some advantages over eigenvector
centrality. We study some properties of the non-backtracking matrix of a

some model and real networks and compare the results with those corresponding
to TURW and maximal entropy random walks (MERW), with the latter being biased
random walks based on eigenvector centrality. We show that the behaviors of
stationary distribution and hitting times for NBCRW widely differ from those

matter cooled the gas through velocity-dependent, Rutherford-like interactions.
We argue that such interactions require a light mediator that is highly
constrained by 5th force experiments and limits from stellar cooling.
Consequently, only a hidden or the visible photon can in principle mediate such
a force. Neutral hydrogen thus plays a sub-leading role and the cooling occurs
via the residual free electrons and protons. We find that these two scenarios
are strongly constrained by the predicted dark matter self-interactions and by
limits on millicharged dark matter respectively. We conclude that the 21-cm
absorption line is unlikely to be the result of gas cooling via the scattering
with a dominant component of the dark matter. An order 1\% subcomponent of
millicharged dark matter remains a viable explanation.

improve resource utilization and reduce energy footprint in cloud data centers.
It can be implemented in a centralized or a distributed fashion. Distributed VM
consolidation approaches are currently gaining popularity because they are
often more scalable than their centralized counterparts and they avoid a single
point of failure.
  Objective: To present a comprehensive, unbiased overview of the
state-of-the-art on distributed VM consolidation approaches.
  Method: A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of the existing distributed VM
consolidation approaches.
  Results: 19 papers on distributed VM consolidation categorized in a variety
of ways. The results show that the existing distributed VM consolidation
approaches use four types of algorithms, optimize a number of different
objectives, and are often evaluated with experiments involving simulations.
  Conclusion: There is currently an increasing amount of interest on developing
and evaluating novel distributed VM consolidation approaches. A number of
research gaps exist where the focus of future research may be directed.

  Theory and Methods: We exploit the extensive symmetries and separability in
the reconstruction steps to account for the correlation between all the
acquired k-space samples. Monte Carlo simulations and multi-repetition phantom
experiments were conducted to test both the accuracy and feasibility of the
proposed method; an in-vivo experiment was performed to assess the
applicability of our method to clinical scenarios.
  Results: Our theoretical derivation shows that the direct k-space analysis
renders an exact noise characterization under the assumptions of stationarity

provide empirical support to the theoretical proof. Finally, the in-vivo
experiment demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to assess the impact

  Conclusions: By operating directly in the k-space, the proposed method is
able to provide an exact characterization of noise for any Cartesian pattern

defined for signals coming from ARMA models. We provide an extension of this
distance to invertible deterministic linear time invariant single input single
output models, and assess its applicability. We show that it can always be
interpreted in terms of the poles and zeros of the underlying model, and that,
in the case of stable, minimum-phase, or unstable, maximum-phase models, a
geometrical interpretation in terms of subspace angles can be given. We then
devise a method to assess stability and phase-type of the generating models,
using only input/output signal information. In this way, we prove a connection
between the extended weighted cepstral distance and a weighted cepstral model
norm. In this way, we provide a purely data-driven way to assess different
underlying dynamics of input/output signal pairs, without the need for any

QCD colour superconducting phase has made it hard to construct a holographic
dual of the state. To side step this problem, we argue that near the chiral
restoration transition in the temperature-chemical potential plane, the
strongly coupled gluons are likely completely gapped so that the colour quantum
numbers of the quarks can be thought of below that gap as global indices. A
standard AdS-superconductor model can then be used to analyze the fermionic gap
formation. We investigate the role of four-fermion interactions, which might be
used to include the gapped QCD interactions, on the vacuum and metastable vacua
of the model. It turns out to be easiest to simply relate the standard
interaction of the holographic superconductor to the strength of the gapped
gluons. The result is a holographic description of the QCD colour
superconducting phase diagram. We take a first look at how quark mass enters
and causes a transition between the colour flavour locked phase and the 2SC
phase.

the ab initio Density Function Theory is used to demonstrate that the chemical

changes the poor graphene excitation spectrum in the ultra-violet frequency

strong in the long-wavelength limit but damped for larger wave-vectors. The

We define new types of edge and chain-edge labelings which we call
\emph{Whitney labelings}. We prove that every graded poset with a Whitney
labeling has a Whitney dual. Moreover, we show how to explicitly construct a
Whitney dual using a technique involving quotient posets.
  As applications of our main theorem, we show that geometric lattices, the
lattice of noncrossing partitions, the poset of weighted partitions studied by
Gonz\'alez D'Le\'on-Wachs, and most of the R$^*$S-labelable posets studied by
Simion-Stanley all have Whitney duals. Our technique gives a combinatorial
description of a Whitney dual of the noncrossing partition lattice in terms of
a family of noncrossing Dyck paths. Our method also provides an explanation of
the Whitney duality between the poset of weighted partitions and a poset of
rooted forests studied by Reiner and Sagan. An integral part of this
explanation is a new chain-edge labeling for the poset of weighted partitions

characteristic of the associated representation is Ehrenborg's flag
quasisymmetric function. The existence of this action implies, using a result

controlling the sticking and unsticking of slabs by tuning the graphene dopings

dissipated energy. As the Dirac plasmons are the dominant channels through
which the energy between slabs can be transferred, the dissipated power in
equally doped EF1 = EF2 = 0 graphenes shows strong omega0 = 2omegap peak. This
peak is substantially reduceed when graphenes are deposited on SiO2 substrate.
If only one graphene is pristine (EFi = 0) the 2omegap peak disappears. For

obviously of key importance. In this work, we focus on one such setting, where
a label is perfectly predictable if the input contains certain features, or

We also give evidence that efficient algorithms cannot achieve this sample

canonical molecular orbital (PNCMO) theory formerly developed by the author. In
some respects, the PNCMO theory is a generalization of the well-known simple
PMO theory: First, the usual diagonalization problem (and/or the eigenvalue
equation) for a certain model Hamiltonian matrix ($\mathbf{H}$) is now replaced
by two interrelated non-canonical one-electron problems, namely by the
block-diagonalization problem for the matrix $\mathbf{H}$\ following from the
Brillouin theorem and determining non-canonical (localized) MOs (NCMOs) and by
the commutation equation for the respective one-electron density matrix
(charge-bond order (CBO)) matrix. Second, perturbative solutions of the
above-specified alternative problems are sought in terms of entire submatrices
(blocks) of the matrix $\mathbf{H}$\ instead of usual matrix elements (e.g. of
Coulomb and resonance parameters). Third, a generalized version of the
perturbation theory (PT) is used in place of the standard
Rayleigh-Schr\""{o}dinger PT (RSPT), wherein non-commutative quantities stand
for the usual (commutative) ones (cf. the so-called non-commutative RSPT
(NCRSPT)). As a result, algebraic expressions are derived for the principal
quantum-chemical characteristics (including the CBO matrix, the NCMO
representation matrix and the total energy) that embrace definite classes of
Hamiltonian matrices and thereby of molecules. To illustrate the point,
saturated and conjugated hydrocarbons are taken as examples. Arguments are
given that the PNCMO theory possibly forms the basis of a novel way of
qualitative chemical thinking.

strong: they trivialise the classification problem by identifying all

and consistent description of the whole data set is still missing. We aim at
improving the current understanding of neutrino-induced pion production on the
nucleus. To this end, the comparison of experimental data with theoretical
predictions, preferably based on microscopic models, is essential to
disentangle the different reaction mechanisms involved in the process. To
describe single-pion production (SPP) we use a hybrid model that combines a
low- and a high-energy approach. The low-energy model (LEM) contains resonances
and background terms. At high invariant masses, a high-energy model based on a
Regge approach is employed. The model is implemented in the nucleus using the
relativistic plane wave impulse approximation (RPWIA). We present a comparison
of the hybrid-RPWIA and LEM with the recent neutrino-induced charged current
$1\pi^+$ production cross section on water reported by T2K. In order to judge
the impact of final-state interactions (FSI) we confront our results with those
of the NuWro Monte Carlo generator. The hybrid-RPWIA model and NuWro compare
favorably to the data, albeit that FSI are not included in the former. These
results complement our previous work [Phys. Rev. D 97, 013004 (2018)] where we
compared the models to the MINERvA and MiniBooNE $1\pi^+$ data. The
hybrid-RPWIA model tends to overpredict both the T2K and MINERvA data in
kinematic regions where the largest suppression due to FSI is expected, and
agrees remarkably well with the data in other kinematic regions. On the
contrary, the MiniBooNE data is underpredicted over the whole kinematic range.

separation logic. Specifically, we study extensions of the points-to fragment
of symbolic-heap separation logic with various forms of Presburger arithmetic
constraints.
  Most significantly, we find that, even in the minimal case when we allow only
conjunctions of simple ""difference constraints"" (x'\leq x+k) where k is an
integer, polynomial-time decidability is already impossible: satisfiability
becomes NP-complete, while quantifier-free entailment becomes coNP-complete and
quantified entailment becomes P2-complete (P2 is the second class in the
polynomial-time hierarchy)
  In fact we prove that the upper bound is the same, P2, even for the full
pointer arithmetic but with a fixed pointer offset, where we allow any Boolean
combinations of the elementary formulas (x'=x+k0), (x'\leq x+k0), and
(x'<x+k0), and, in addition to the points-to formulas, we allow spatial
formulas of the arrays the length of which is bounded by k0 and lists which
length is bounded by k0, etc, where k0 is a fixed integer.
  However, if we allow a significantly more expressive form of pointer
arithmetic - namely arbitrary Boolean combinations of elementary formulas over
arbitrary pointer sums - then the complexity increase is relatively modest for
satisfiability and quantifier-free entailment: they are still NP-complete and
coNP-complete respectively, and the complexity appears to increase drastically
for quantified entailments.

of Mojirsheibani (1999, 2000, 2002a, 2002b), who proposed a smart method for
combining several classifiers, relying on a consensus notion. In many
aggregation methods, the prediction for a new observation x is computed by
building a linear or convex combination over a collection of basic estimators
r1(x),. .. , rm(x) previously calibrated using a training data set.
Mojirsheibani proposes to compute the prediction associated to a new
observation by combining selected outputs of the training examples. The output
of a training example is selected if some kind of consensus is observed: the
predictions computed for the training example with the different machines have
to be ""similar"" to the prediction for the new observation. This approach has
been recently extended to the context of regression in Biau et al. (2016). In
the original scheme, the agreement condition is actually required to hold for
all individual estimators, which appears inadequate if there is one bad initial
estimator. In practice, a few disagreements are allowed ; for establishing the
theoretical results, the proportion of estimators satisfying the condition is
required to tend to 1. In this paper, we propose an alternative procedure,
mixing the previous consensus ideas on the predictions with the Euclidean
distance computed between entries. This may be seen as an alternative approach
allowing to reduce the effect of a possibly bad estimator in the initial list,
using a constraint on the inputs. We prove the consistency of our strategy in
classification and in regression. We also provide some numerical experiments on
simulated and real data to illustrate the benefits of this new aggregation
method. On the whole, our practical study shows that our method may perform
much better than the original combination technique, and, in particular,
exhibit far less variance. We also show on simulated examples that this
procedure mixing inputs and outputs is still robust to high dimensional inputs.

applied electrostatic field, interact because their electrons are a common
electron-thermodynamic system. Except at small separations, the interaction
reduces the apex field enhancement factor (FEF) of each nanostructure, by means
of ""charge blunting"". A parameter of interest is the fractional reduction (-d)
of the apex FEF, as compared with the apex FEF for the same emitter when
standing alone on the base-plate. For systems of two or a few identical
post-like emitters, or regular arrays of such emitters, details have been
investigated by methods based on numerical solution of Laplace's equation, and
by using line-charge models. For post separations c comparable with post height
h, several authors have shown that the variation of (-d) with c is well
described by formulae having exponential or quasi-exponential form. By
contrast, explorations of the two-emitter situation using the
""floating-sphere-at-emitter-plane potential"" (FSEPP) model have predicted that,
for large c-values, (-d) falls off as 1/c*c*c. Numerical Laplace-type
simulations carried out by de Assis and Dall'Agnol (arXiv:1711.00601v2) have
confirmed this limiting dependence for six different situations involving pairs
of protruding nanostructures; hence they suggest it as an universal law. By
using the FSEPP model for the central structure, and by adopting a ""first
moments"" representation for the distant structure, this letter shows that a
clear physical reason can be given for this numerically discovered general
limiting (1/c*c*c) dependence. An implication is that the quasi-exponential
formula found useful for c comparable with h is simply a good fitting formula.
A second implication is that the FSEPP model, which currently is used mainly in
nanoscience, may have much wider applicability to electrostatic phenomena.

typically described as sensors and actuators, that can either be directly
attached to the computer components, or at a remote location, and accessible
through a network connection. The modeling and verification of such systems is
a hard task and error prone that require rigorous techniques. Hybrid automata
is a formalism that extends finite-state automata with continuous behavior,
described by ordinary differential equations. This paper uses a rewriting
logic-based technique to model and validate CPS, thus exploring the use of a
formal technique to develop such systems that combines expressive specification
with efficient state-based analysis. Moreover, we aim at the modular
specification of such systems such that each CPS component is independently
specified and the final system emerges as the synchronous product of its
constituent components. We model CPSs using Linear Hybrid Automaton and
implement them in Real-Time Maude, a rewriting logic tool for real-time
systems. With this method, we develop a specification for the $n$-reservoir
problem, a CPS that controls a hose to fill a number of reservoirs according to
the physical properties of the hose and the reservoirs.

system undergoes a first-order transition from a superfluid to a diagonal
striped solid with ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}=(\pi/4,3\pi/4)$ or
$(\pi/4,5\pi/4)$. Unlike the one-dimensional situation, our results in the
two-dimensional case reveal a supersolid phase (corresponding to the diagonal
striped solid) around filling $1/8$ and at large off-site repulsions.
Furthermore, for small off-site repulsions, we witness a valence bond solid at
one-fourth filling and tiny phase-separated regions at slightly higher

becomes gradually unrealistic for human to confirm quality of all samples. Some
studies have investigated this problem and provided solutions to avoid threats
in sample selection, but some of these solutions (e.g., finding development

increases, these semi-automatic solutions become less useful since the effort
in need for human intervention is far beyond affordable. To solve this problem,
we investigated the GHTorrent dataset and proposed a method to detect public
development projects. The results show that our method can effectively improve
the sample selection process in two ways: (1) We provide a simple model to
automatically select samples (with 0.827 precision and 0.947 recall); (2) We
also offer a complex model to help researchers carefully screen samples (with
63.2% less effort than manually confirming all samples, and can achieve 0.926

radiative transfer have not included support for volume and boundary sources
that are spatially uncorrelated from the scattering events in the medium.
Birth-collision free paths are treated identically to collision-collision free
paths and application of this to general, bounded scenes with inclusions leads
to non-reciprocal transport. Beginning with reciprocity as a desired property,
we propose a new way to integrate non-exponential transport theory into general
scenes. We distinguish between the free-path-length statistics between
correlated medium particles and the free-path-length statistics beginning at
locations not correlated to medium particles, such as boundary surfaces,
inclusions and uncorrelated sources. Reciprocity requires that the uncorrelated
free-path distributions are simply the normalized transmittance of the
correlated free-path distributions. The combination leads to an equilibrium
imbedding of a previously derived generalized transport equation into bounded
domains. We compare predictions of this approach to Monte Carlo simulation of
multiple scattering from negatively-correlated suspensions of monodispersive
hard spheres in bounded two-dimensional domains and demonstrate improved
performance relative to previous work. We also derive new, exact, reciprocal,
single-scattering solutions for plane-parallel half-spaces over a variety of
non-exponential media types.

synchronization strings of arbitrary length exist over an alphabet whose size
depends only on $\varepsilon$. Specifically, they obtained an alphabet size of
$O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, which left an open question on where the minimal size of
such alphabets lies between $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-1})$ and
$O(\varepsilon^{-4})$. In this work, we partially bridge this gap by providing
an improved lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3/2})$, and an improved upper
bound of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. We also provide fast explicit constructions of
synchronization strings over small alphabets.
  Further, along the lines of previous work on similar combinatorial objects,
we study the extremal question of the smallest possible alphabet size over
which synchronization strings can exist for some constant $\varepsilon < 1$. We
show that one can construct $\varepsilon$-synchronization strings over
alphabets of size four while no such string exists over binary alphabets. This
reduces the extremal question to whether synchronization strings exist over
ternary alphabets.

However, in contrast to 2H-phase of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
the absence of spin splitting in the PtSe2 ML may limit the functionality for
spintronics application. Through fully-relativistic density-functional theory
calculations, we show that large spin splitting can be induced in the PtSe2 ML
by introducing a substitutional halogen impurity. Depending on the atomic
number (Z) of the halogen dopants, we observe an enhancement of the spin
splitting in the localized impurity states (LIS), which is due to the increased
contribution of the p-d orbitals coupling. More importantly, we identify very
large Rashba splitting in the LIS near Fermi level around the Gamma point
characterized by hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface. We show that the
Rashba splitting can be controlled by adjusting the doping concentration.
Therefore, this work paves a possible way to induce the significant Rashba
splitting in the two-dimensional TMDs, which is useful for spintronic devices

discrete random variables $X_l(m,N)$ ($0\le l\le N-1$, $1\le M\le N)$ recently
introduced and studied in [24]. Here we extend our results by considering
$X_l(m,N)$ as sub-Gaussian random variables. Our investigation is motivated by
the known fact thatthe so-called Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) introduced
in [4] holds with high probability for any matrix generated by a sub-Gaussian
random variable. Notice that sensing matrices with the RIP play a crucial role
in Theory of compressive sensing.
  Our main results concern the proofs of the lower and upper bound estimates of
the expected values of the random variables $|X_l(m,N)|$, $|U_l(m,N)|$ and
$|V_l(m,N)|$, where $U_l(m,N)$ and $U_l(m,N)$ are the real and the imaginary
part of $X_l(m,N)$, respectively. These estimates are also given in terms of
related sub-Gaussian norm $\Vert \cdot\Vert_{\psi_2}$ considered in [28].
Moreover, we prove a refinement of the mentioned upper bound estimates for the
real and the imaginary part of $X_l(m,N)$.

generalization of the product and chain rules for the Caputo fractional
derivative. These results are especially important for physical and biological
systems that exhibit multiple spatial and temporal scales, such as porous
materials and clusters of neurons, in which transport phenomena are governed by
a fractional derivative of slowly varying parameters given in terms of
elementary functions. Both the product and chain rules of the Caputo fractional
derivative are obtained from the expansion of the fractional derivative in
terms of an infinite series of integer order derivatives. The crucial step in
the practical implementation of the fractional product rule relies on the exact
evaluation of the repeated integral of the generalized hypergeometric function
with a power-law argument. By applying the generalized Euler's integral
transform, we are able to represent the repeated integral in terms of a single
hypergeometric function of a higher order. We demonstrate the obtained results
by the exact evaluation of the Caputo fractional derivative of hyperbolic
tangent which describes dark soliton propagation in the non-linear media. We
conclude that in the most general case both fractional chain and product rules
result in an infinite series of the generalized hypergeometric functions.

without any information about energy or temperature. Although PS can be
universally constructed for any number of components R, practical application
of PS to systems with R >= 3 is non-trivial compared with R = 2 (i.e., binary
system). This is because (i) essentially, multicomponent system should
inevitably requires linear transformation from conventional basis functions to
intuitively-interpreted cluster probability basis, i.e., multiple PS energies
are required to predict one chosen pair probability, leading to practically
accumulating numerical errors, and (ii) additionally, explicit formula for the
transformation from basis functions to pair probabilities should be required,
which has been explicitly provided up to ternary (R = 3) system so far. We here
derive modified formulation to directly determine probability for likeand
unlike-atom pair consisting of any chosen elements by using a single PS energy,
with providing explicit relationship between basis functions and pair

annotators are subject to a common preference or social utility function which
generates their comparison behaviors in experiments. However, in reality
annotators are subject to variations due to multi-criteria, abnormal, or a
mixture of such behaviors. In this paper, we propose a parsimonious
mixed-effects model, which takes into account both the fixed effect that the
majority of annotators follows a common linear utility model, and the random
effect that some annotators might deviate from the common significantly and
exhibit strongly personalized preferences. The key algorithm in this paper
establishes a dynamic path from the social utility to individual variations,
with different levels of sparsity on personalization. The algorithm is based on
the Linearized Bregman Iterations, which leads to easy parallel implementations
to meet the need of large-scale data analysis. In this unified framework, three
kinds of random utility models are presented, including the basic linear model
with L2 loss, Bradley-Terry model, and Thurstone-Mosteller model. The validity
of these multi-level models are supported by experiments with both simulated

exhibit improvements in both interpretability and predictive precision compared
