arrangement is aspherical. Having generalized this to many real reflection
groups, Brieskorn conjectured this for all finite Coxeter groups. This in turn
follows from Deligne's seminal work from 1972, where he showed that the
complexification of every real simplicial arrangement is a
$K(\pi,1)$-arrangement.
  In this paper we study the $K(\pi,1)$-property for a certain class of
subarrangements of Weyl arrangements, the so called arrangements of ideal type
${\mathscr A}_I$. These stem from ideals $I$ in the set of positive roots of a
reduced root system. We show that the $K(\pi,1)$-property holds for all
arrangements ${\mathscr A}_I$ if the underlying Weyl group is classical and
that it extends to most of the ${\mathscr A}_I$ if the underlying Weyl group is
of exceptional type. Conjecturally this holds for all ${\mathscr A}_I$. In
general, the ${\mathscr A}_I$ are neither simplicial, nor is their
complexification fiber type.

(5G) calls for the ultimate utilization of the wide bandwidth in the mmWave
frequency band. Researchers seeking to compensate for mmWave's high path loss
and to achieve both gain and directivity have proposed that mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems make use of beamforming systems.
Hybrid beamforming in mmWave demonstrates promising performance in achieving
high gain and directivity by using phase shifters at the analog processing
block. What remains a problem, however, is the actual implementation of mmWave
beamforming systems; to fabricate such a system is costly and complex. With the
aim of reducing such cost and complexity, this article presents actual
prototypes of the lens antenna as an effective device to be used in the future
5G mmWave hybrid beamforming systems. Using a lens as a passive phase shifter
enables beamforming without the heavy network of active phase shifters, while
gain and directivity are achieved by the energy-focusing property of the lens.
Proposed in this article are two types of lens antennas, one for static and the
other for mobile usage. Their performance is evaluated using measurements and
simulation data along with link-level analysis via a software defined radio
(SDR) platform. Results show the promising potential of the lens antenna for
its high gain and directivity, and its improved beam-switching feasibility
compared to when a lens is not used. System-level evaluations reveal the
significant throughput enhancement in both real indoor and outdoor
environments. Moreover, the lens antenna's design issues are also discussed by
evaluating different lens sizes.

how it can be built into the Internet of Things (IoT). The need to build
accountability into the IoT is motivated by the opaque nature of distributed
data flows, inadequate consent mechanisms, and lack of interfaces enabling
end-user control over the behaviours of internet-enabled devices. The lack of
accountability precludes meaningful engagement by end-users with their personal
data and poses a key challenge to creating user trust in the IoT and the
reciprocal development of the digital economy. The EU General Data Protection
Regulation 2016 (GDPR) seeks to remedy this particular problem by mandating
that a rapidly developing technological ecosystem be made accountable. In doing
so it foregrounds new responsibilities for data controllers, including data
protection by design and default, and new data subject rights such as the right
to data portability. While GDPR is technologically neutral, it is nevertheless
anticipated that realising the vision will turn upon effective technological
development. Accordingly, this paper examines the notion of accountability, how
it has been translated into systems design recommendations for the IoT, and how
the IoT Databox puts key data protection principles into practice.

difficulties for generating adversarial texts with gradient methods are i) the
input space is discrete, which makes it difficult to accumulate small noise
directly in the inputs, and ii) the measurement of the quality of the
adversarial texts is difficult. We tackle the first problem by searching for
adversarials in the embedding space and then reconstruct the adversarial texts
via nearest neighbor search. For the latter problem, we employ the Word Mover's
Distance (WMD) to quantify the quality of adversarial texts. Through extensive
experiments on three datasets, IMDB movie reviews, Reuters-2 and Reuters-5
newswires, we show that our framework can leverage gradient attacking methods
to generate very high-quality adversarial texts that are only a few words
different from the original texts. There are many cases where we can change one
word to alter the label of the whole piece of text. We successfully incorporate
FGM and DeepFool into our framework. In addition, we empirically show that WMD
is closely related to the quality of adversarial texts.

with better image quality and deeper penetration into tissue. Segmentation is a
required step to characterize and analyze biological structures in the images
and recent 3D segmentation using deep learning has achieved promising results.
One issue is that deep learning techniques require a large set of groundtruth
data which is impractical to annotate manually for large 3D microscopy volumes.
This paper describes a 3D deep learning nuclei segmentation method using
synthetic 3D volumes for training. A set of synthetic volumes and the
corresponding groundtruth are generated using spatially constrained
cycle-consistent adversarial networks. Segmentation results demonstrate that
our proposed method is capable of segmenting nuclei successfully for various
data sets.

  Geophysical Research - Planets",,"10.1002/2017JE005383",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Liquid water is one of the most important materials affecting the climate and
habitability of a terrestrial planet. Liquid water vaporizes entirely when
planets receive insolation above a certain value, which is called the runaway
greenhouse threshold. This threshold forms the inner most limit of the
habitable zone. Here, we investigate the effect of the distribution of surface
water on the runaway greenhouse threshold for Earth-sized planets using a
three-dimensional dynamic atmosphere model. We considered a 1-bar atmosphere
whose composition is similar to the current Earth's atmosphere with a zonally
uniform distribution of surface water. As previous studies have already shown,
we also recognized two climate regimes: the land planet regime, which has dry
low latitude and wet high latitude region, and the aqua planet regime, which is
globally wet. We showed that each regime is controlled by the width of the
Hadley circulation, the amount of surface water, and the planetary topography.
We found that the runaway greenhouse threshold varies continuously with the
surface water distribution from about 130% (an aqua planet) to 180% (the
extreme case of a land planet) of the present insolation at Earth's orbit. Our
results indicate that the inner edge of the habitable zone is not a single
sharp boundary, but a border whose location varies depending on planetary
surface condition, such as the amount of surface water. Since land planets have
wider habitable zones and less cloud cover, land planets would be good targets
for future observations investigating planetary habitability.

remnants (black-holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs) in close binary systems,
provide strong test beds for constraining the poorly understood accretion
process. The efficiency of angular momentum (and thus mass) transport in
accretion discs, which has traditionally been encoded in the $\alpha$-viscosity
parameter, shapes the light-curves of these outbursts. Numerical simulations of
the magneto-rotational instability that is believed to be the physical
mechanism behind this transport find values of $\alpha \sim 0.1-0.2$ as
required from observations of accreting white dwarfs. Equivalent
$\alpha$-viscosity parameters have never been estimated in discs around neutron
stars or black holes. Here we report the results of an analysis of archival
X-ray light-curves of twenty-one black hole X-ray binary outbursts. Applying a
Bayesian approach for a model of accretion allows us to determine corresponding
$\alpha$-viscosity parameters, directly from the light curves, to be $\alpha
\sim$0.2--1. This result may be interpreted either as a strong intrinsic rate
of angular momentum transport in the disc, which can only be sustained by the
magneto-rotational instability if a large-scale magnetic field threads the
disc, or as a direct indication that mass is being lost from the disc through
substantial mass outflows strongly shaping the X-ray binary outburst.
Furthermore, the lack of correlation between our estimates of
$\alpha$-viscosity and accretion state implies that such outflows can remove a
significant fraction of disc mass in all black hole X-ray binary accretion
states, favouring magnetically-driven winds over thermally-driven winds that
require specific radiative conditions.

backstepping controllers that act at the right endpoint of the domain is more
challenging than its left endpoint counterpart. The standard application of the
backstepping method fails, because corresponding kernel models become
overdetermined. In order to deal with this difficulty, we introduce the
pseudo-backstepping method, which uses a pseudo-kernel that satisfies all but
one desirable boundary condition. Moreover, various norms of the pseudo-kernel
can be controlled through a parameter in one of its boundary conditions. We
prove that the boundary controllers constructed via this pseudo-kernel still
exponentially stabilize the system with the cost of a low exponential rate of
decay. We show that a single Dirichlet controller is sufficient for exponential
stabilization with a slower rate of decay. We also consider a second order
feedback law acting at the right Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that
this approach works if the main equation includes only the third order term,
while the same problem remains open if the main equation involves the first
order and/or the nonlinear term(s). At the end of the paper, we give numerical
simulations to illustrate the main result.

the maximum allowable outage threshold specified by the PUs. Further, the
effective number of secondary transmit antennas is specified based on the
optimal power allocation for an arbitrary MIMO scale. Also, a lower bound on

caused by the large refractive index contrast between the bulk material they
are embedded in and air: this results in a small fraction (that can be as low
as <1%) of the emitted photons reaching free-space collection optics. To
overcome this issue, we present a device that combines a metallic nano-ring,
positioned on the sample surface and centered around the emitter, and an
epoxy-based super-solid immersion lens, deterministically deposited above the
ring devices. We show that the combined broadband lensing effect of the
nano-ring and of the super-solid immersion lens significantly increases the
extraction of light emitted by single InAs/GaAs quantum dots into free space:
we observe enhancements in the emitted intensity by the nano-ring of up to a
factor 20 and by the super-solid immersion lens of up to a factor 10. Such
cumulative enhancements allow us to measure photon fluxes approaching 1 million
counts per second, from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot in bulk. The combined
broad-band enhancement in the extraction of light can be implemented with any

(iii) the time-lagged smallest eigenvalue has a statistically significant

  Auditing",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CR cs.DB cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For enhancing the privacy protections of databases, where the increasing
amount of detailed personal data is stored and processed, multiple mechanisms
have been developed, such as audit logging and alert triggers, which notify
administrators about suspicious activities; however, the two main limitations
in common are: 1) the volume of such alerts is often substantially greater than
the capabilities of resource-constrained organizations, and 2) strategic
attackers may disguise their actions or carefully choosing which records they
touch, making incompetent the statistical detection models. For solving them,
we introduce a novel approach to database auditing that explicitly accounts for
adversarial behavior by 1) prioritizing the order in which types of alerts are
investigated and 2) providing an upper bound on how much resource to allocate
for each type. We model the interaction between a database auditor and
potential attackers as a Stackelberg game in which the auditor chooses an
auditing policy and attackers choose which records to target. A corresponding
approach combining linear programming, column generation, and heuristic search
is proposed to derive an auditing policy. For testing the policy-searching
performance, a publicly available credit card application dataset are adopted,
on which it shows that our methods produce high-quality mixed strategies as
database audit policies, and our general approach significantly outperforms
non-game-theoretic baselines.

develop Rover Descent, a solution that allows us to learn a fairly broad
optimization policy from training on a small set of prototypical
two-dimensional surfaces that encompasses the classically hard cases such as
valleys, plateaus, cliffs and saddles and by using strictly zero-order

understood and mitigated in the next generation of liquid xenon (LXe)
experiments searching for WIMP dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay,
and in the large liquid argon (LAr) detectors for the long-baseline neutrino
programmes. We present a systematic study of this spurious emission involving a
series of slow voltage-ramping tests on fine metal wires immersed in a
two-phase xenon time projection chamber with single electron sensitivity.
Emission currents as low as $10^{-18}$ A can thus be detected by electron
counting, a vast improvement over previous dedicated measurements. Emission
episodes were recorded at surface fields as low as $\sim$10 kV/cm in some wires
and observed to have complex emission patterns, with average rates of 10-200
counts per second (c/s) and outbreaks as high as $\sim$10$^6$ c/s. A fainter,
less variable type of emission was also present in all untreated samples. There
is evidence of a partial conditioning effect, with subsequent tests yielding on
average fewer emitters occurring at different fields for the same wire. We find
no evidence for an intrinsic threshold particular to the metal-LXe interface
which might have limited previous experiments up to fields of at least 160
kV/cm. The general phenomenology is not consistent with enhanced field emission
from microscopic filaments, but it appears instead to be related to the quality
of the wire surface in terms of corrosion and the nature of its oxide layer.
This study concludes that some surface treatments, in particular nitric acid
cleaning for stainless steel wires, can bringing about at least
order-of-magnitude improvements in overall electron emission rates, and this
should help the next generation of detectors achieve the required electrostatic
performance.

general relativity correction to the Newtonian values of the position of

approaches are based on time measurements. The first approach exploits a pulsar
emitting signals and two receiving antennas located at L1 and L2, respectively.
The second method is based on a relativistic positioning system based on the

synchronization of clocks at L1 and L2. The third method combines a pulsar and
an artificial emitter at the stable points L4 or L5 forming a basis for the

data items of a workflow, and has served as an integral ingredient for both
traditional (e.g., debugging, auditing, data integration, and security) and
emergent (e.g., interactive visualizations, iterative analytics, explanations,
and cleaning) applications. The core, long-standing problem that lineage
systems need to address---and the main focus of this paper---is to capture the
relationships between input and output data items across a workflow with the
goal to streamline queries over lineage. Unfortunately, current lineage systems
either incur high lineage capture overheads, or lineage query processing costs,
or both. As a result, applications, that in principle can express their logic
declaratively in lineage terms, resort to hand-tuned implementations. To this
end, we introduce Smoke, an in-memory database engine that neither lineage
capture overhead nor lineage query processing needs to be compromised. To do
so, Smoke introduces tight integration of the lineage capture logic into
physical database operators; efficient, write-optimized lineage representations
for storage; and optimizations when future lineage queries are known up-front.
Our experiments on microbenchmarks and realistic workloads show that Smoke
reduces the lineage capture overhead and streamlines lineage queries by
multiple orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Our
experiments on real-world applications highlight that Smoke can meet the
latency requirements of interactive visualizations (e.g., <150ms) and
outperform hand-written implementations of data profiling primitives.

encountered in plasma physics --- the flow of magnetic field lines and the
guiding center motion of magnetized charged particles --- resist symplectic
integration by conventional means because the dynamics are most naturally
formulated in non-canonical coordinates, i.e., coordinates lacking the familiar
$(q, p)$ partitioning. Recent efforts made progress toward non-canonical
symplectic integration of these systems by appealing to the variational
integration framework; however, those integrators were multistep methods and
later found to be numerically unstable due to parasitic mode instabilities.
This work eliminates the multistep character and, therefore, the parasitic mode
instabilities via an adaptation of the variational integration formalism that
we deem ``degenerate variational integration''. Both the magnetic field line
and guiding center Lagrangians are degenerate in the sense that their resultant
Euler-Lagrange equations are systems of first-order ODEs. We show that
retaining the same degree of degeneracy when constructing a discrete Lagrangian
yields one-step variational integrators preserving a non-canonical symplectic
structure on the original Hamiltonian phase space. The advantages of the new
algorithms are demonstrated via numerical examples, demonstrating superior
stability compared to existing variational integrators for these systems and
superior qualitative behavior compared to non-conservative algorithms.

star. The disk is threaded by a weak, large-scale poloidal magnetic field, and
the central star has no strong stellar magnetosphere initially. Our simulation
investigates the structure of the accretion flows from a turbulent accretion
disk onto the star. The simulation reveals that fast accretion onto the star at
high latitudes occurs even without a stellar magnetosphere. We find that the
failed disk wind becomes the fast, high-latitude accretion as a result of
angular momentum exchange mediated by magnetic fields well above the disk,
where the Lorentz force that decelerates the rotational motion of gas can be
comparable to the centrifugal force. Unlike the classical magnetospheric
accretion scenario, fast accretion streams are not guided by magnetic fields of
the stellar magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the accretion velocity reaches the
free-fall velocity at the stellar surface due to the efficient angular momentum
loss at a distant place from the star. This study provides a possible
explanation why Herbig Ae/Be stars whose magnetic fields are generally not
strong enough to form magnetospheres also show indications of fast accretion. A
magnetically driven jet is not formed from the disk in our model. The
differential rotation cannot generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields for
the jet acceleration because the Parker instability interrupts the field
amplification.

study the kinematic and density structure of the SDC13 hub at high angular
resolution to determine what drives its evolution and fragmentation. We have
mapped SDC13, a 1000Msun infrared dark hub, in NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) emission
lines, with both the JVLA and GBT down to 0.07pc. The mass-per-unit-lengths of
all four hub filaments are thermally super-critical, consistent with the
presence of tens of gravitationally bound cores along them. These cores exhibit
regular separation of 0.37 +/- 0.16 pc suggesting gravitational instabilities
running along these super-critical filaments are responsible for their
fragmentation. The observed local increase of the dense gas velocity dispersion
towards starless cores is believed to be a consequence of such fragmentation
process. We see velocity gradient peaks towards 63% of the cores as expected
during the early stages of filament fragmentation. The most massive cores are
located at the filament junctions, where the velocity dispersion is the
largest. We interpret this as the result of the hub morphology generating the
largest acceleration gradients near the hub centre. We propose a scenario for
the evolution of the SDC13 hub in which filaments first form as post-shock
structures in a supersonic turbulent flow. Then gravity takes over and starts
shaping the evolution of the hub, both fragmenting filaments and pulling the
gas towards the centre of the gravitational well. By doing so, gravitational
energy is converted into kinetic energy in both local (cores) and global (hub
centre) potential well minima. Furthermore, the generation of larger
gravitational acceleration gradients at the filament junctions promotes the
formation of more massive cores. [abridged]

nuclei. A comparison of Nucleus_2 ($M_V = -15.5$) with ultracompact dwarf

having formed through tidal stripping of a gas-rich disk galaxy. Evidence for
this comes from its extended star-formation history, long blue tidal stream,
and elevated dynamical-to-stellar-mass ratio. While the majority of its stars
formed $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago, about 1/3 by mass formed during starbursts in the

momentum-space. Each time a transformation is applied, the system changes state
as the particles re-distribute their energy and angular momenta. These diagrams
have the virtue of containing all of the quantitative information needed to
fully characterize most bound or unbound interactions through time and space,
including the total duration of the interaction, the initial and final stable
states in addition to every intervening temporary meta-stable state. As shown
via an illustrative example for the bound case, prolonged excursions of one of
the particles, which by far dominates the computational cost of the
simulations, are reduced to a single discrete transformation in energy- and
angular momentum-space, thereby potentially mitigating any computational
expense. We further generalize our formalism to sequences of (unbound)
three-body interactions, as occur in dense stellar environments during binary
hardening. Finally, we provide a method for dynamically evolving entire
populations of binaries via three-body scattering interactions, using a purely
analytic formalism. In principle, the techniques presented here are adaptable

haloes down to the atomic cooling limit and model the inter-stellar medium with
better than $\approx10$ pc resolution. The project has numerous goals in
improving our understanding of reionization and making predictions for future
observations. In this first paper we study how the inclusion of binary stars in
computing stellar luminosities impacts reionization, compared to a model that
includes only single stars. Owing to the suppression of galaxy growth via
strong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement with observational
estimates of the galaxy luminosity function. We find that binaries have a
significant impact on the timing of reionization: with binaries, our boxes are
$99.9$ percent ionized by volume at $z\approx 7$, while without them our
volumes fail to reionize by $z=6$. These results are robust to changes in
volume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The escape of ionizing
radiation from individual galaxies varies strongly and frequently. On average,
binaries lead to escape fractions of $\approx 7-10$ percent, about $3.5$ times
higher than with single stars only. The higher escape fraction is a result of a
shallower decline in ionizing luminosity with age, and is the primary reason
for earlier reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with
binaries also plays a sub-dominant role.

positive Bayesian evidence. A constant equation of state of the additional
early energy density is constrained to 0.086$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$. Although this
value deviates significantly from 1/3, valid for dark radiation, the latter is
not disfavoured based on the Bayesian evidence. If the tension persists, future
estimates of $H_0$ at the 1$\%$ level will be able to decisively determine
which of the proposed explanations is favoured.

In the case of black branes, we construct `mushroom-type' static solutions from
the effective equations, where a spherical horizon is connected with an
asymptotic planar horizon through a `neck' which is locally black-string shape.
We argue that this neck part (of black string) cannot be pinched off
dynamically from the perspective of thermodynamical stability. In the case of
black holes, we show that the equatorial plane on the spherical horizon cannot
be sufficiently squashed unless the specific heat is positive. We also discuss
that the solutions are stable against linear perturbation, agreeing with the
thermodynamical argument. These results suggest that Gregory-Laflamme type
instability does not occur at the neck, in favor of the cosmic censorship.

to describe the distribution of galaxy luminosity and colour as a function of
halo mass. It consists of two populations of different colour distributions,
dubbed pseudo-blue and pseudo-red, respectively, with each further separated
into central and satellite galaxies. We define a global parameterization of
these four colour-magnitude distributions and their dependence on halo mass,
and we infer parameter values by simultaneously fitting the space densities and
auto-correlation functions of 79 galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey defined by fine bins in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The model
deprojects the overall galaxy CMD, revealing its tomograph along the halo mass
direction. The bimodality of the colour distribution is driven by central
galaxies at most luminosities, though at low luminosities it is driven by the
difference between blue centrals and red satellites. For central galaxies, the
two pseudo-colour components are distinct and orthogonal to each other in the
CCMD: at fixed halo mass, pseudo-blue galaxies have a narrow luminosity range
and broad colour range, while pseudo-red galaxies have a narrow colour range
and broad luminosity range. For pseudo-blue centrals, luminosity correlates
tightly with halo mass, while for pseudo-red galaxies colour correlates more
tightly (redder galaxies in more massive haloes). The satellite fraction is
higher for redder and for fainter galaxies, with colour a stronger indicator
than luminosity. We discuss the implications of the results and further
applications of the CCMD model.

hierarchical nature of the LambdaCDM model. Recent observations of Milky
Way-like galaxies have revealed a wide range in stellar halo mass, including
cases with no statistically significant detection of a stellar halo, as in the
case of M101, NGC3351 and NGC1042. We use the Illustris simulation to
investigate the scatter in stellar halo content and, in particular, to study
the formation of galaxies with the smallest fraction of this diffuse component.
Stellar halos are far from spherical, which diminishes the surface brightness
of the stellar halo for face-on disks. Once accounting for projection effects,
we find that the stellar halo fraction f_SH correlates strongly with galaxy
morphology and star formation rate, but not with environment, in agreement with
observations. Galaxies with the lowest stellar halo fractions are
disk-dominated, star-forming and assemble their dark matter halos on average
earlier than galaxies with similar stellar masses. Accreted satellites are also
lower in stellar mass and have earlier infall times than centrals with high
f_SH. In situ rather than accreted stars dominate the stellar halos of galaxies
with the lowest stellar halo fractions, with a transition radius from in situ
to accretion-dominated r~45 kpc. Our results extrapolated to real galaxies such
as M101 may indicate that these galaxies inhabit old halos which endured
mergers only at higher redshifts and evolved relatively unperturbed in the last
~10 Gyrs.

self-energy functional we derive depends only on the self-energies of the
disorder-averaged propagators, allowing for the construction of general
non-perturbative approximations. Using a simple single-site reference system
with only three variational parameters, we are able to reproduce numerically
exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results on local observables of the
Bose-Hubbard model with box disorder with high accuracy. At strong
interactions, the phase boundaries are reproduced qualitatively but shifted
with respect to the ones observed with QMC due to the extremely low condensate
fraction in the superfluid phase. Deep in the strongly-disordered
weakly-interacting regime, the simple reference system employed is insufficient
and no stationary solutions can be found within its restricted variational
subspace. By systematically analyzing thermodynamical observables and the
spectral function, we find that the strongly-interacting Bose glass is
characterized by different regimes, depending on which local occupations are
activated as a function of the disorder strength. We find that the particles
delocalize into isolated superfluid lakes over a strongly localized background
around maximally-occupied sites whenever these sites are particularly rare. Our
results indicate that the transition from the Bose glass to the superfluid
phase around unit filling at strong interactions is driven by the percolation
of superfluid lakes which form around doubly occupied sites.

It

instead of dissociating immediately it roams around the molecule for a

since been reported in the dissociation of a number of other molecules. In this
paper we investigate roaming in Chesnavich's CH$_4^+$ model. During
dissociation the free hydrogen must pass through three phase space bottleneck
for the classical motion, that can be shown to exist due to unstable periodic
orbits. None of these orbits is associated with saddle points of the potential
energy surface and hence related to transition states in the usual sense. We
explain how the intricate phase space geometry influences the shape and
intersections of invariant manifolds that form separatrices, and establish the
impact of these phase space structures on residence times and rotation numbers.

including the residual atmospheric backgrounds, a Galactic contribution (such
as from cosmic ray interactions with gas), an extra-galactic contribution from
pp interactions (such as from starburst galaxies) and a hard extragalatic
contribution from photo-hadronic interactions at the highest energies (such as
from Tidal Disruption Events or Active Galactic Nuclei). We demonstrate that
this model can address the key problems of astrophysical neutrino data, such as
the different observed spectral indices in the high-energy starting and
through-going muon samples, a possible anisotropy due to Galactic events, the
non-observation of point sources, and the constraint from the extragalatic
diffuse gamma-ray background. Furthermore, the recently observed muon track
with a deposited energy of 4.5 PeV might be interpreted as evidence for the
extragalactic photo-hadronic contribution. We perform the analysis based on the
observed events instead of the unfolded fluxes by computing the probability
distributions for the event type and reconstructed neutrino energy. As a
consequence, we give the probability to belong to each of these astrophysical
components on an event-to-event basis.

work, but it is able to deal with models that have a precision matrix for the
random-effect vector that is linear in the inverse of the variance parameters
(i.e., the precision parameters). We call the method SOP (Separation of
Overlapping Precision matrices). SOP is based on applying the method of
successive approximations to easy-to-compute estimate updates of the variance
parameters. These estimate updates have an appealing form: they are the ratio
of a (weighted) sum of squares to a quantity related to effective degrees of
freedom. We provide the sufficient and necessary conditions for these estimates
to be strictly positive. An important application field of SOP is penalised
regression estimation of models where multiple quadratic penalties act on the
same regression coefficients. We discuss in detail two of those models:
penalised splines for locally adaptive smoothness and for hierarchical curve
data. Several data examples in these settings are presented.

assumed or guessed. The fundamental problem of the bulk reconstruction program,
which is \emph{recovering the bulk background geometry (metric)} from the
boundary CFT state is still outstanding. In this work, we formulate a recipe to
extract the bulk metric itself from the boundary state, specifically, the
modular Hamiltonian information of spherical subregions in the boundary. Our
recipe exploits the recent construction of Kabat and Lifschytz
\cite{Kabat:2017mun} to first compute the bulk two point function of scalar
fields directly in the CFT without knowledge of the bulk metric or the
equations of motion, and then to take a large scaling dimension limit (WKB) to
extract the geodesic distance between two close points in the bulk i.e. the
metric. As a proof of principle, we consider three dimensional bulk and
selected CFT states such as the vacuum and the thermofield double states. We
show that they indeed reproduce the pure AdS and the regions outside the
Rindler wedge and the BTZ black hole \emph{up to a rigid conformal factor}.
Since our approach does not rely on symmetry properties of the CFT state, it
can be applied to reconstruct asymptotically AdS geometries dual to arbitrary
general CFT states provided the modular Hamiltonian is available. We discuss
several obvious extensions to the case of higher spacetime dimensions as well
as some future applications, in particular, for constructing metric beyond the
causal wedge of a boundary region. In the process, we also extend the
construction of \cite{Kabat:2017mun} to incorporate the first order
perturbative locality for AdS scalars.

lensed sources in such surveys, identified as those with $S_{500\mu m} > 100$

expunged. The combination of these attributes makes submillimeter surveys ideal
for the study of strong lens statistics. We carried out a pilot study of the
lensing statistics of submillimetre-selected sources by making observations
with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) of a sample of strongly-lensed
sources selected from surveys carried out with the Herschel Space Observatory.
We attempted to reproduce the distribution of image separations for the lensed
sources using a halo mass function taken from a numerical simulation which
contains both dark matter and baryons. We used three different density
distributions, one based on analytical fits to the halos formed in the EAGLE
simulation and two density distributions (Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) and
SISSA) that have been used before in lensing studies. We found that we could
reproduce the observed distribution with all three density distributions, as
long as we imposed an upper mass transition of $\sim$$10^{13} M_{\odot}$ for
the SIS and SISSA models, above which we assumed that the density distribution
could be represented by an NFW profile. We show that we would need a sample of
$\sim$500 lensed sources to distinguish between the density distributions,
which is practical given the predicted number of lensed sources in the Herschel

Conventionally, radial and angular correlation energies of helium atom are

explicit dependence on the interelectronic distance. Here, we show this
rationale to associate the contribution from radial-angular coupling entirely
to the angular part underestimating the radial one, thereby also incorrectly
predict non-vanishing residual radial probability densities. We derive analytic
matrix elements for the high-precision Hylleraas basis set framework to
seamlessly uncouple the angular correlation energy from its radial counterpart.
The resulting formula agrees with numerical cubature yielding precise purely
angular correlation energies for the ground as well as excited states. Our
calculations indicate 60.2% of helium's correlation energy to arise from
strictly radial interactions; when excluding the contribution from the

mechanism in stellar models appropriate for hot pre-horizontal branch stars to
predict their pulsational properties and the instability domain in the $\log
g-\log T_{\rm eff}$ plane. We perform detailed computations of non-adiabatic
non-radial pulsations on stellar models during the helium subflashes just

long-period gravity modes due to the $\epsilon$ mechanism in the $\log g-\log
T_{\rm eff}$ plane at roughly $22000\,{\rm K} \lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim
50000\,$K and $4.67 \lesssim \log g \lesssim 6.15$. Consequently, we find
instabilities due to the $\epsilon$ mechanism on pre-extreme horizontal branch
stellar models ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim 22000\,$K), but not on pre-blue horizontal
branch stellar models ($T_{\rm eff}\lesssim 21000\,$K). The periods of excited
modes range between $\sim 200$ and $\sim2000\,$s. Comparison with the three
known pulsating He-rich subdwarfs shows that $\epsilon$ mechanism can excite
gravity modes in stars with similar surface properties, but in our models it is
only able to excite modes in the range of the shortest observed periods. We
predict a new instability strip for hot-subdwarf stars of which LS
IV-14$^{\circ}$116 could be the first inhabitant. Based on simple estimates we
expect 1 to 10 stars in the current samples of hot-subdwarf stars to be
pulsating by the $\epsilon$ mechanism. Our results could constitute a

based on an existing (classified) database. Given a database S of n
d-dimensional points and a d-dimensional query q, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN)
classifier assigns q with the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in S.
  In the secure version of kNN, S and q are owned by two different parties that
do not want to share their data. Unfortunately, all known solutions for secure
kNN either require a large communication complexity between the parties, or are
very inefficient to run.
  In this work we present a classifier based on kNN, that can be implemented
efficiently with homomorphic encryption (HE). The efficiency of our classifier
comes from a relaxation we make on kNN, where we allow it to consider kappa
nearest neighbors for kappa ~ k with some probability. We therefore call our
classifier k-ish Nearest Neighbors (k-ish NN).
  The success probability of our solution depends on the distribution of the
distances from q to S and increase as its statistical distance to Gaussian
decrease.
  To implement our classifier we introduce the concept of double-blinded
coin-toss. In a doubly-blinded coin-toss the success probability as well as the
output of the toss are encrypted. We use this coin-toss to efficiently
approximate the average and variance of the distances from q to S. We believe
these two techniques may be of independent interest.
  When implemented with HE, the k-ish NN has a circuit depth that is
independent of n, therefore making it scalable. We also implemented our
classifier in an open source library based on HELib and tested it on a breast
tumor database. The accuracy of our classifier (F_1 score) were 98\% and
classification took less than 3 hours compared to (estimated) weeks in current
HE implementations.

achieved by an analytic extension of the involved Beta measures as tempered

symmetric cones, we analyze for which indices the obtained Beta distributions
are still measures. At the same time, we characterize the indices for which a
Sonine formula between the related Bessel functions exists. As for Riesz

is not defined on individual experimental units, but rather on pairs or, more
generally, on groups of units. For example, teachers may choose pairs of
students who do not know each other to teach a new curriculum; regulators might
allow or disallow merging of firms, and biologists may introduce or inhibit
interactions between genes or proteins. In this paper, we formalize this
experimental setting, and we refer to the individual treatments in such setting
as entangled treatments. We then consider the special case where individual
treatments depend on a common population quantity, and develop theory and
methodology to deal with this case. In our target applications, the common
population quantity is a network, and the individual treatments are defined as
functions of the change in the network between two specific time points. Our
focus is on estimating the causal effect of entangled treatments in
observational studies where entangled treatments are endogenous and cannot be
directly manipulated. When treatment cannot be manipulated, be it entangled or
not, it is necessary to account for the treatment assignment mechanism to avoid
selection bias, commonly through a propensity score methodology. In this paper,
we quantify the extent to which classical propensity score methodology ignores
treatment entanglement, and characterize the bias in the estimated causal
effects. To characterize such bias we introduce a novel similarity function
between propensity score models, and a practical approximation of it, which we
use to quantify model misspecification of propensity scores due to
entanglement. One solution to avoid the bias in the presence of entangled
treatments is to model the change in the network, directly, and calculate an
individual unit's propensity score by averaging treatment assignments over this
change.

be described by the Hamilton's or the Friedmann-Raychaudhuri equations, but the
map between the two descriptions is not one-to-one. A careful analysis resolves
the tension on symmetric versus asymmetric bounce in this model, showing that
the bounce must be asymmetric and symmetric bounce is physically inconsistent,
in contrast to the standard LQC. In addition, the current observations only
allow a scenario where the pre-bounce branch is asymptotically de Sitter,
similar to a quantization of the Schwarzschild interior in LQC, and the
post-bounce branch yields the classical general relativity. For a quadratic
potential, we find that a slow-roll inflation generically happens after the
bounce, which is quite similar to what happens in LQC.

consistency model that is more natural for system design. We focus on the
problem of what a designer should do if she has an algorithm that works
correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value

a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness
predicate, say P , and continue to run the protocol, as our system monitors P .
If P is violated (because the underlying key-value store provides a weaker
consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state
where P holds.
  We evaluate this approach in the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments
with deployment of Voldemort on Amazon AWS shows that using eventual
consistency with monitoring can provide 20 - 40% increase in throughput when
compared with sequential consistency. We also show that the overhead of the
monitor itself is small (typically less than 8%) and the latency of detecting
violations is very low. For example, more than 99.9% violations are detected in
less than 1 second.

topological, and visual models. The hypothesis evaluated in this manuscript is
whether the choice of a communication model impacts the performance of a tasked
artificial swarm. The biological models are used to design coordination
algorithms for a simulated swarm, which are evaluated over a range of six swarm
robotics tasks. Each task has an associated set of performance metrics that are
used to evaluate how the communication models fare against each other. The
general findings demonstrate that the communication model significantly affects
the swarm's performance for individual tasks, and this result implies that the
communication model-task pairing is an important consideration when designing
artificial swarms. Further analysis of each tasks' performance metrics reveal
instances in which pairwise considerations of model and one of the various
experimental factors becomes relevant. The reported research demonstrates that
the artificial swarm's task performance can be increased through the careful
selection of a communications model.

dipole immersed within an optical cavity containing a quantized radiation field
is studied in detail. The chosen molecule under study, lithium fluoride (LiF),
is characterized by the presence of an avoided crossing between the two lowest
$^1\Sigma$ potential energy curves (covalent-ionic diabatic crossing). Without
field, after prompt excitation from the ground state $1\; ^1\Sigma$, the
excited nuclear wave packet moves back and forth in the upper $2\; ^1\Sigma$
state, but in the proximity of the avoided crossing, the non-adiabatic coupling
transfers part of the nuclear wave packet to the lower $1\; ^1\Sigma$ state,
which eventually leads to dissociation. The quantized field of a cavity also
induces an additional light crossing in the modified dressed potential energy
curves with similar transfer properties. To understand the entangled
photonic-nuclear dynamics we solve the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation by
using the multiconfigurational time dependent Hartree method (MCTDH). The
single mode quantized field of the cavity is represented in the coordinate
space instead of in the Fock space, which allows us to deal with the field as
an additional vibrational mode within the MCTDH procedure on equal footing. We
prepare the cavity with different quantum states of light, namely, Fock states,
coherent states and squeezed coherent states. Our results reveal pure quantum
light effects on the molecular photodynamics and the dissociation yields of
LiF, which are quite different from the light-undressed case and that cannot be

from proper motions or from radial velocities) with uncertainties well below 1

frequencies is best associated with the proton-cyclotron resonance scale,
$1/k_c$, compared to the proton inertial length $d_i$ and proton gyroscale
$\rho_i$. This agreement is strongest when we consider periods where
$\beta_{i,\perp}\sim1$, and is consistent with a spectral break at $d_i$ for
$\beta_{i,\perp}\ll1$ and $\rho_i$ for $\beta_{i,\perp}\gg1$. We also find that
the coherent magnetic helicity signature observed at these frequencies is
bounded at low frequencies by $1/k_c$ and its absolute value reaches a maximum
at $\rho_i$. These results hold in both slow and fast wind streams, but with a
better correlation in the more Alfv\'enic fast wind where the helicity
signature is strongest. We conclude that these findings are consistent with
proton-cyclotron resonance as an important mechanism for dissipation of
turbulent energy in the solar wind, occurring at least half the time in our
selected interval. However, we do not rule out additional mechanisms.

three-dimensions is introduced and termed a vortex-entrainment sheet. The
vorticity in the layer is accounted for by a conventional vortex sheet. The
mass and momentum in the layer are represented by a two dimensional surface
having its own internal tangential flow. Namely, the sheet has a mass density
per-unit-area making it dynamically distinct from the surrounding outer fluid.
The mechanism of entrainment is represented by a discontinuity in the normal
component of velocity across the sheet. The sheet mass is able to support a
pressure jump, which in turn may cause additional entrainment. This feature was
confirmed when the model was used to represent the Falkner-Skan boundary
layers. The velocity field induced by the vortex-entrianment sheet is given by
a generalized Birkhoff-Rott equation with a complex sheet strength. The model
was also applied to the case of separation at a sharp edge. There is no
requirement for an explicit Kutta condition in the form of a singularity
removal as this condition is inherently satisfied through an appropriate
balance of normal momentum with the pressure jump across the sheet. A pressure
jump at the edge results in the generation of new vorticity. The shedding angle
is dictated by the normal impulse of the intrinsic flow inside the bound sheets
as they merge to form the free sheet. When there is zero entrainment everywhere
the model reduces to the conventional vortex sheet with no mass. Consequently,
the pressure jump must be zero and the shedding angle must be tangential so
that the sheet simply convects off the wedge face. Lastly, the
vortex-entrainment sheet model was demonstrated on two shedding example
problems.

point out that inference of the shape and amplitude of the matter power

as a powerful framework for describing evolving interactions between agents in
complex systems. In such studies, after pre-processing, the data can be
represented by a set of graphs, each representing a system's state at different
points in time. The analysis of the system's dynamics depends on the selection
of the appropriate analytical tools. After characterizing similarities between
states, a critical step lies in the choice of a distance between graphs capable
of reflecting such similarities. While the literature offers a number of
distances that one could a priori choose from, their properties have been
little investigated and no guidelines regarding the choice of such a distance
have yet been provided. In particular, most graph distances consider that the
nodes are exchangeable and do not take into account node identities. Accounting
for the alignment of the graphs enables us to enhance these distances'
sensitivity to perturbations in the network and detect important changes in
graph dynamics. Thus the selection of an adequate metric is a decisive --yet
delicate--practical matter.

microbiome dataset and a brain fMRI study. We show examples of using
permutation tests to detect the effect of covariates on the graphs'

drawbacks of the different distances. Above all, we provide some guidance for
choosing one distance over another in certain types of applications.

instability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the
nature of shear flows. In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and
sub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency
right circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic
flows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave
becomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate
of the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than
the corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the
Hall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)
channel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become
Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller
than the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of
the flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the
induction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a
new overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin
Helmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the
advection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven
Mach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the
growth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with
smaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows.

pilot authentication (PA). To solve this, we propose, for a two-user
multi-antenna OFDM system, a code-frequency block group (CFBG) coding based PA
mechanism. Here multi-user pilot information, after being randomized
independently to avoid being spoofed, are converted into activation patterns of
subcarrier-block groups on code-frequency domain. Those patterns, though
overlapped and interfered mutually in the wireless transmission environment,
are qualified to be separated and identified as the original pilots with high
accuracy, by exploiting CFBG coding theory and channel characteristic.
Particularly, we develop the CFBG code through two steps, i.e., 1) devising an
ordered signal detection technique to recognize the number of signals
coexisting on each subcarrier block, and encoding each subcarrier block with
the detected number; 2) constructing a zero-false-drop (ZFD) code and block
detection based (BD) code via k-dimensional Latin hypercubes and integrating
those two codes into the CFBG code. This code can bring a desirable pilot
separation error probability (SEP), inversely proportional to the number of
occupied subcarriers and antennas with a power of k. To apply the code to PA, a
scheme of pilot conveying, separation and identification is proposed. Based on
this novel PA, a joint channel estimation and identification mechanism is
proposed to achieve high-precision channel recovery and simultaneously enhance
PA without occupying extra resources. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

originated by the ionizing feedback from a star with spectral type B0.5V-B0V.
The central region of the ring-like feature does not contain detectable ionized

by the ionizing feedback from a massive star. Several embedded Herschel clumps
and young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified in the MCG35.6, tracing the
ongoing SF activities within the cloud. The polarization information from the

parallel to the major axis of the ring-like feature. At least five clumps

regularly spaced manner along the ring-like feature and contain noticeable
YSOs. Based on the analysis of the polarization and molecular line data, three

$z\sim2.5$ in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field (XDF). Comparing stellar mass
estimates from spatially resolved and spatially unresolved photometry we find
that unresolved masses can be systematically underestimated by factors of up to
5. The ratio of the unresolved to resolved mass measurement depends on the
galaxy's specific star formation rate (sSFR): at low sSFRs the bias is small,
but above sSFR$\ \sim 10^{-9.5}$ yr$^{-1}$ the discrepancy increases rapidly
such that galaxies with sSFRs$\ \sim 10^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$ have unresolved mass
estimates of only one half to one fifth of the resolved value. This result
indicates that stellar masses estimated from spatially-unresolved datasets need
to be systematically corrected, in some cases by large amounts, and we provide
an analytic prescription for applying this correction. We show that correcting
stellar mass measurements for this bias changes the normalization and slope of
the star-forming main sequence and reduces its intrinsic width; most
dramatically, correcting for the mass bias increases the stellar mass density
of the Universe at high redshift and can resolve the long-standing discrepancy

determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging, because of the
shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their optical spectra as well as
observational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D,
non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate
that oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000)
optical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a
measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest
spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but
are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer
atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the
oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing
molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features across
the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in
atomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the
other carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen
abundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both
the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing
non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the
results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be limited
to those elements that have observable lines themselves.

cosmological Millennium-II simulation and hydrodynamical APOSTLE simulations to
investigate the performance of the SJE in recovering the underlying mass
profiles of MW mass haloes. The best-fitting halo mass and concentration
parameters scatter by 25% and 40% around their input values, respectively, when
dark matter particles are used as tracers. This scatter becomes as large as a
factor of 3 when using star particles instead. This is significantly larger
than the estimated statistical uncertainty associated with the use of the SJE.
The existence of correlated phase-space structures that violate the steady
state assumption of the SJE as well as non-spherical geometries are the
principal sources of the scatter. Binary haloes show larger scatter because
they are more aspherical in shape and have a more perturbed dynamical state.
Our results confirm the previous study of Wang et al. (2017) that the number of
independent phase-space structures sets an intrinsic limiting precision on
dynamical inferences based on the steady state assumption. Modelling with a
radius-independent velocity anisotropy, or using tracers within a limited outer
radius, result in significantly larger scatter, but the ensemble-averaged

vorticity in 2D. First, we prove that the gradient of $\omega^\theta/r$ can

It is called the Delta Conjecture. It was recently proved in \cite{GHRY} that
the Delta Conjecture is true when either $q=0$ or $t=0$. In this paper we
complete a work initiated by Remmel whose initial aim was to explore the
symmetric function $\Delta_{s_\nu} e_n$ by the same methods developed in

function that may be viewed as a ""combinatorial side"" for the symmetric
function $\Delta_{s_\nu} e_n$ for $t=0$. Based on what was discovered in
\cite{GHRY} we conjectured such a construction mechanism. We prove here that in
the case that $\nu=(m-k,1^k)$ with $1\le m< n$ the equality of the two sides
can be established by the same methods used in \cite{GHRY}. While this work was
in progress, we learned that Rhodes and Shimozono had previously constructed

privacy risks. In this work we consider a privacy threat to a social network in
which an attacker has access to a subset of random walk-based node
similarities, such as effective resistances (i.e., commute times) or
personalized PageRank scores. Using these similarities, the attacker's goal is
to infer as much information as possible about the underlying network,
including any remaining unknown pairwise node similarities and edges.
  For the effective resistance metric, we show that with just a small subset of
measurements, the attacker can learn a large fraction of edges in a social
network, even when the measurements are noisy. We also show that it is possible
to learn a graph which accurately matches the underlying network on all other
effective resistances. This second observation is interesting from a data
mining perspective, since it can be expensive to accurately compute all
effective resistances. As an alternative, our graphs learned from just a subset
of approximate effective resistances can be used as surrogates in a wide range
of applications that use effective resistances to probe graph structure,
including for graph clustering, node centrality evaluation, and anomaly
detection.
  We obtain our results by formalizing the graph learning objective
mathematically, using two optimization problems. One formulation is convex and
can be solved provably in polynomial time. The other is not, but we solve it
efficiently with projected gradient and coordinate descent. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of these methods on a number of social networks obtained from
Facebook. We also discuss how our methods can be generalized to other random

report complementary plasmonic structures (CPS) for transmission structural
coloration by tailoring a single spectral peak depending on the incident angle

conventional hybridized nanostructures of plasmonic nanohole and nanodisk
arrays, the nanodisks of CPS effectively attenuate undesired spectral peaks of
nanoholes by exploiting an extinction peak of nanodisks, serving as a spectral
suppressor. As a result, a single transmission spectral peak becomes
red-shifted from 736 nm to 843 nm as the incident angle varies from 0{\deg} to
30{\deg}. This unique configuration provides a new direction for tunable

flow of programs to perform malicious actions without injecting any codes. Many
defenses, classed into software-based and hardware-based, have been proposed.
However, software-based methods are difficult to be deployed in practical
systems due to high performance overhead. Hardware-based methods can reduce
performance overhead but may require extending instruction set architectures
(ISAs) and modifying compiler or suffer the vulnerability of key leakage. To
tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new hardware-based control flow
checking method to resist CRAs with negligible performance overhead without
extending ISAs, modifying compiler and leaking the encryption/decryption key.
The key technique involves two control flow checking mechanisms. The first one
is the encrypted Hamming distances (EHDs) matching between the physical
unclonable function (PUF) response and the return addresses, which prevents
attackers from returning between gadgets so long as the PUF response is secret,
thus resisting ROP attacks. The second one is the liner encryption/decryption
operation (XOR) between PUF response and the instructions at target addresses
of call and jmp instructions to defeat JOP attacks. Advanced return-based
full-function reuse attacks will be prevented with the dynamic key-updating
method. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
method introduces negligible 0.95% run-time overhead and 0.78% binary size
overhead on average.

category theory. The first part surveys the classical theory of homotopy
coherent diagrams of topological spaces. The second part introduces the
homotopy coherent nerve and connects it to the free resolutions used to define
homotopy coherent diagrams. This connection explains why diagrams valued in

nearby galaxy NGC 2403. The HII regions are observed with a long-slit
spectrograph mounted on the 2.16 m telescope at XingLong station of National
Astronomical Observatories of China. For each of the HII regions, spectra are
extracted at different nebular radii along the slit-coverage. Oxygen abundances
are empirically estimated from the strong-line indices R23, N2O2, O3N2, and N2
for each spectrophotometric unit, with both observation- and model-based
calibrations adopted into the derivation. Radial profiles of these diversely
estimated abundances are drawn for each nebula. In the results, the oxygen
abundances separately estimated with the prescriptions on the basis of
observations and models, albeit from the same spectral index, systematically
deviate from each other; at the same time, the spectral indices R23 and N2O2
are distributed with flat profiles, whereas N2 and O3N2 exhibit apparent
gradients with the nebular radius. Because our study naturally samples various
ionization levels which inherently decline at larger radii within individual
HII regions, the radial distributions indicate not only the robustness of R23
and N2O2 against ionization variations but also the sensitivity of N2 and O3N2
to the ionization parameter. The results in this paper provide observational
corroboration of the theoretical prediction about the deviation in the
empirical abundance diagnostics. Our future work is planned to investigate
metal-poor HII regions with measurable T_e, in an attempt to recalibrate the
strong-line indices and consequently disclose the cause of the discrepancies
between the empirical oxygen abundances.

mechanisms of both the persistent X-ray emission and the burst emission of the
magnetars, we have proposed a model that the persistent X-ray emission consists
of numerous micro-bursts of various sizes. If this model is correct, intensity
Root Mean Square (RMS) variations of the persistent emission exceed the values
expected from the Poisson distribution. Using $Suzaku$ archive data of 11
magnetars (22 observations), the RMS intensity variations were calculated from
0.2 keV to 70 keV. As a result, we found significant excess RMS intensity
variations from all the 11 magnetars. We suppose that numerous mircro-bursts
constituting the persistent X-ray emission cause the observed variations,
suggesting that the persistent X-ray emission and the burst emission have
identical emission mechanisms. In addition, we found that the RMS intensity
variations clearly increase toward higher energy bands for 4 magnetars (6
observations). The energy dependent RMS intensity variations imply that the
soft thermal component and the hard X-ray component are emitted from different
regions far apart from each other.

rotators in saturated regime with Rossby number Ro$\lesssim0.1$. In the
unsaturated regime, chromospheric and coronal emission show similar dependence

in several real-world applications in data science, machine learning, and

introducing $\kappa^g$ for the supermodular term (a natural dual curvature for

reading comprehension, and it is more concise than a tedious passage in
passage-based QA. These advantages make ABQA more suitable for human-computer
interaction scenarios such as voice-controlled speakers. Further progress
towards improving ABQA requires richer supervised dataset and powerful models
of text understanding. To remedy this, we introduce a new dataset called
WebAssertions, which includes hand-annotated QA labels for 358,427 assertions
in 55,960 web passages. To address ABQA, we develop both generative and
extractive approaches. The backbone of our generative approach is sequence to
sequence learning. In order to capture the structure of the output assertion,
we introduce a hierarchical decoder that first generates the structure of the
assertion and then generates the words of each field. The extractive approach
is based on learning to rank. Features at different levels of granularity are
designed to measure the semantic relevance between a question and an assertion.
Experimental results show that our approaches have the ability to infer
question-aware assertions from a passage. We further evaluate our approaches by
incorporating the ABQA results as additional features in passage-based QA.
Results on two datasets show that ABQA features significantly improve the
accuracy on passage-based~QA.

  corrected some statistics of our results (baseline training setting (iii)) on
  UCF sports dataset",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we contribute to video saliency research in two ways. First, we
introduce a new benchmark for predicting human eye movements during dynamic
scene free-viewing, which is long-time urged in this field. Our dataset, named
DHF1K (Dynamic Human Fixation), consists of 1K high-quality, elaborately
selected video sequences spanning a large range of scenes, motions, object
types and background complexity. Existing video saliency datasets lack variety
and generality of common dynamic scenes and fall short in covering challenging
situations in unconstrained environments. In contrast, DHF1K makes a
significant leap in terms of scalability, diversity and difficulty, and is
expected to boost video saliency modeling. Second, we propose a novel video
saliency model that augments the CNN-LSTM network architecture with an
attention mechanism to enable fast, end-to-end saliency learning. The attention
mechanism explicitly encodes static saliency information, thus allowing LSTM to
focus on learning more flexible temporal saliency representation across
successive frames. Such a design fully leverages existing large-scale static
fixation datasets, avoids overfitting, and significantly improves training
efficiency and testing performance. We thoroughly examine the performance of
our model, with respect to state-of-the-art saliency models, on three
large-scale datasets (i.e., DHF1K, Hollywood2, UCF sports). Experimental
results over more than 1.2K testing videos containing 400K frames demonstrate
that our model outperforms other competitors.

(2DLDA) is a successful matrix based dimensionality reduction method. However,
2DLDA may encounter the singularity issue theoretically and the sensitivity to
outliers. In this paper, a generalized Lp-norm 2DLDA framework with
regularization for an arbitrary $p>0$ is proposed, named G2DLDA. There are
mainly two contributions of G2DLDA: one is G2DLDA model uses an arbitrary
Lp-norm to measure the between-class and within-class scatter, and hence a
proper $p$ can be selected to achieve the robustness. The other one is that by
introducing an extra regularization term, G2DLDA achieves better generalization
performance, and solves the singularity problem. In addition, G2DLDA can be
solved through a series of convex problems with equality constraint, and it has
closed solution for each single problem. Its convergence can be guaranteed
theoretically when $1\leq p\leq2$. Preliminary experimental results on three
contaminated human face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed
G2DLDA.

between the number of quasars exhibiting at least one detected absorber and the
total number of quasars that can be used to detect absorptions with given

density of absorbers in given velocity intervals (dn/d\beta) and the f_c show
very significant excess at the low-velocity offset from the quasars, relative
to the random occurrence that is expected for cosmologically intervening
absorbers. These relative excess extensions for Mg II absorptions are not only
evidently related to absorption strength but also to quasar luminosity, while
they are mainly constrained within 2000 km/s no matter what quasar luminosity
and absorption strength are. In addition, we find that the redshift number
density (dn/dz) evolution of Mg II absorbers with v_abs <2000 km/s evidently
differs from that with v_abs >2000 km/s. Turning to C IV absorptions, the
relative excess extensions of both dn/d\beta and f_c are mainly limited within
v_abs<4000 km/s, and depend neither on absorption strength nor on quasar

ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular anisotropy is studied by means of
micromagnetic simulations and compared to the conventional case of a single
ferromagnetic layer. Our results, where only the lower ferromagnetic layer is
subjected to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and to the spin
Hall effect, indicate that the domain walls can be synchronously driven in the
presence of a strong interlayer exchange coupling, and that the velocity is
significantly enhanced due to the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling as
compared with the single-layer case. On the contrary, when the coupling is of
ferromagnetic nature, the velocity is reduced. We provide a full micromagnetic
characterization of the current-driven motion in these multilayers, both in the
absence and in the presence of longitudinal fields, and the results are
explained based on a one-dimensional model. The interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, only necessary in this lower layer, gives
the required chirality to the magnetization textures, while the interlayer
exchange coupling favors the synchronous movement of the coupled walls by a
dragging mechanism, without significant tilting of the domain wall plane.
Finally, the domain wall dynamics along curved strips is also evaluated. These
results indicate that the antiferromagnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic
layers mitigates the tilting of the walls, which suggest these systems to
achieve efficient and highly packed displacement of trains of walls for
spintronics devices. A study, taking into account defects and thermal
fluctuations, allows to analyze the validity range of these claims.

The values of the Einstein $A$ coefficients of sub-millimeter candidate water

research fields in condensed-matter physics. An important question is how to
enhance the transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of a superconductor. In this
respect, the possibly positive role of valence-skipping elements in the pairing
mechanism has been attracting considerable interest. Here we follow this
pathway and successfully enhance $T_{\rm c}$ up to almost 6 K in the simple
chalcogenide SnTe known as topological crystalline insulator by doping the
valence-skipping element In and codoping Se. A high-pressure synthesis method
enabled us to form single-phase solid solutions
Sn$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te$_{1-y}$Se$_{y}$ over a wide composition range while
keeping the cubic structure necessary for the superconductivity. Our
experimental results are supported by density-functional theory calculations
which suggest that even higher $T_{\rm c}$ values would be possible if the
required doping range were experimentally accessible.

of providing high spatial resolution of Ultrasound (US) imaging and high
contrast of optical imaging. Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most common beamforming
algorithm in PAI. However, using DAS beamformer leads to low resolution images
and considerable contribution of off-axis signals. A new paradigm namely
Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS), which was originally used as a reconstruction
algorithm in confocal microwave imaging, was introduced to overcome the
challenges in DAS. DMAS was used in PAI systems and it was shown that this
algorithm results in resolution improvement and sidelobe degrading. However,
DMAS is still sensitive to high levels of noise, and resolution improvement is
not satisfying. Here, we propose a novel algorithm based on DAS algebra inside
DMAS formula expansion, Double Stage DMAS (DS-DMAS), which improves the image
resolution and levels of sidelobe, and is much less sensitive to high level of
noise compared to DMAS. The performance of DS-DMAS algorithm is evaluated
numerically and experimentally. The resulted images are evaluated qualitatively
and quantitatively using established quality metrics including signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) and contrast ratio (CR). It is
shown that DS-DMAS outperforms DAS and DMAS at the expense of higher
computational load. DS-DMAS reduces the lateral valley for about 15 dB and
improves the SNR and FWHM better than 13% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the
levels of sidelobe are reduced for about 10 dB in comparison with those in
DMAS.

fully describe the high-momentum tail of the density distribution up to
$q^{-6}$ ($q$ is the relative momentum), four center-of-mass-momentum-dependent
parameters are required, which we identify as contacts. These contacts appear
in various universal relations connecting microscopic and thermodynamic
properties. One contact is related to the variation of energy with respect to
the inverse scattering length and determines the leading $q^{-4}$ tail of the
high-momentum distribution. Another vector contact appears in the subleading
$q^{-5}$ tail, which is related to the velocity of closed-channel molecules.
The other two contacts emerge in the $q^{-6}$ tail and are respectively related
to the variation of energy with respect to the range parameter and to the
kinetic energy of closed-channel molecules. Particularly, we find that the
$q^{-5}$ tail and part of the $q^{-6}$ tail of the momentum distribution show
anisotropic features. We derive the universal relations and, as a concrete

Patients at high risk of developing distant metastasis could benefit from

diverse cellular components within the tumor microenvironment in the
development and progression of CRC tumors. In this paper, we show that a new

the microenvironment. Specifically, we determine what cell types are found in
the vicinity of other cell types, and in what numbers, rather than
concentrating exclusively on the cancerous cells. We then extract novel tissue
phenotypic signatures using statistical measurements about tissue composition.
Such signatures can underpin clinical decisions about the advisability of

is provided allowing us to consider various choices for the fit-to-data

validity of this approach for solving convex optimization problems encountered

results, an algorithm is also proposed for noisy graphical lasso where a

quantitatively investigate the impact of scalar waves by solving the full field

the quantitative effect of waves is generally negligible, even for the largest
amplitudes of waves that are physically expected. In order to spoil the
screening in the Solar System, a significant amount of wave energy would have
to be focused on the Solar System by arranging the sources in a spherical shell

pointed to the east before the eruption. We use a nonlinear fore-free field

field and calculate the magnetic energy density distributions at different
heights. The distribution of the magnetic energy density shows a strong
gradient toward the northeast. The propagation direction of the CME from a
Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) modeling deviates from the radial direction
of the source region by about 45 degr in longitude and about 30 degr in
latitude, which is consistent with the gradient of the magnetic energy
distribution around the AR.The MFR axis determined by the GCS modeling points
southward, which has rotated counterclockwise by about 95 degr compared with
the orientation of the MFR in the low corona.The MFR reconstructed by a
Grad-Shafranov (GS) method at 1 AU has almost the same orientation as the MFR
from the GCS modeling, which indicates that the MFR rotation occurred in the
low corona. It is the rotation of the MFR that caused the intense geomagnetic
storm with the minimum Dst of -155 nT. These results suggest that the coronal
magnetic field surrounding the MFR plays a crucial role in the MFR rotation and
propagation direction.

channels. From weak to strong confinement, five scaling regimes, de Gennes,
extended de Gennes, transition, backfolding, and Odijk regimes, are
distinguished for neutral polymers.The size scalings in each regime are derived
as a function of the channel width. The scaling exponents $-1$ and $-1/3$ are
obtained for the transition and backfolding regimes, respectively, which result
from the reduction of the excluded volume of the segments by restriction of the
segment's orientation in the narrowed channels. For charged flexible chains,
the de Gennes regime is split into Flory-de Gennes and electro-de Gennes
regimes owing to strong Coulomb repulsion in electrostatic blobs. Nonetheless,
the extended de Gennes and transition regimes are shrunken. The study of the
fluctuations of the chain size shows consistent scaling demarcations for both
the neutral and charged chain systems.

produce Joule heating. The dark modes do not modify the molecular absorption
lineshape and the related temperature increase is chemically triggered by the
presence of molecules with vibrational fingerprints resonant with the plasmonic
dark modes. The bright modes, instead, are prone to Fano interference, display
an asymmetric molecular absorption lineshape and generate heat also at
frequencies far from molecular vibrations, insofar lacking chemical
specificity. For focused mid-infrared laser power of 50 mW, the measured

assumption that the propagation of CMEs in interplanetary space is solely under
the influence of magnetohydrodynamical drag, where CME propagation is
determined based on CME initial properties as well as the properties of the
ambient solar wind. We present an upgraded version, covering ensemble modelling
to produce a distribution of possible ICME arrival times and speeds, the
drag-based ensemble model (DBEM). Multiple runs using uncertainty ranges for
the input values can be performed in almost real-time, within a few minutes.
This allows us to define the most likely ICME arrival times and speeds,
quantify prediction uncertainties and determine forecast confidence. The
performance of the DBEM is evaluated and compared to that of ensemble
WSA-ENLIL+Cone model (ENLIL) using the same sample of events. It is found that
the mean error is $ME=-9.7$ hours, mean absolute error $MAE=14.3$ hours and
root mean square error $RMSE=16.7$ hours, which is somewhat higher than, but
comparable to ENLIL errors ($ME=-6.1$ hours, $MAE=12.8$ hours and $RMSE=14.4$
hours). Overall, DBEM and ENLIL show a similar performance. Furthermore, we
find that in both models fast CMEs are predicted to arrive earlier than
observed, most probably owing to the physical limitations of models, but
possibly also related to an overestimation of the CME initial speed for fast
CMEs.

past decade. While works based on facial expressions or speech abound,
recognizing affect from body gestures remains a less explored topic. We present
a new comprehensive survey hoping to boost research in the field. We first
introduce emotional body gestures as a component of what is commonly known as
""body language"" and comment general aspects as gender differences and culture
dependence. We then define a complete framework for automatic emotional body
gesture recognition. We introduce person detection and comment static and
dynamic body pose estimation methods both in RGB and 3D. We then comment the
recent literature related to representation learning and emotion recognition
from images of emotionally expressive gestures. We also discuss multi-modal
approaches that combine speech or face with body gestures for improved emotion
recognition. While pre-processing methodologies (e.g. human detection and pose
estimation) are nowadays mature technologies fully developed for robust large
scale analysis, we show that for emotion recognition the quantity of labelled
data is scarce, there is no agreement on clearly defined output spaces and the
representations are shallow and largely based on naive geometrical
representations.

computability, with the goal of making second-order complexity theory more
approachable. We rely on the usual oracle machines to model programs with
subroutine calls. In contrast to previous results, the use of higher-order
objects as running times is avoided, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead,
regular polynomials are used. This is achieved by refining the notion of
oracle-polynomial-time introduced by Cook. We impose a further restriction on
the oracle interactions to force feasibility. Both the restriction as well as
its purpose are very simple: it is well-known that Cook's model allows
polynomial depth iteration of functional inputs with no restrictions on size,
and thus does not guarantee that polynomial-time computability is preserved. To
mend this we restrict the number of lookahead revisions, that is the number of
times a query can be asked that is bigger than any of the previous queries. We
prove that this leads to a class of feasible functionals and that all feasible
problems can be solved within this class if one is allowed to separate a task
into efficiently solvable subtasks. Formally put: the closure of our class
under lambda-abstraction and application includes all feasible operations. We
also revisit the very similar class of strongly polynomial-time computable
operators previously introduced by Kawamura and Steinberg. We prove it to be
strictly included in our class and, somewhat surprisingly, to have the same
closure property. This can be attributed to properties of the limited recursion
operator: It is not strongly polynomial-time computable but decomposes into two
such operations and lies in our class.

bottleneck, which is due to the unpredictable latency in waiting for slowest
nodes (or stragglers) to finish their tasks. We propose a novel coding
strategy, named \emph{entangled polynomial code}, for designing the
intermediate computations at the worker nodes in order to minimize the recovery
threshold (i.e., the number of workers that we need to wait for in order to
compute the final output). We demonstrate the optimality of entangled
polynomial code in several cases, and show that it provides orderwise
improvement over the conventional schemes for straggler mitigation.
Furthermore, we characterize the optimal recovery threshold among all linear
coding strategies within a factor of $2$ using \emph{bilinear complexity}, by
developing an improved version of the entangled polynomial code. In particular,
while evaluating bilinear complexity is a well-known challenging problem, we
show that optimal recovery threshold for linear coding strategies can be
approximated within a factor of $2$ of this fundamental quantity. On the other
hand, the improved version of the entangled polynomial code enables further and
orderwise reduction in the recovery threshold, compared to its basic version.
Finally, we show that the techniques developed in this paper can also be

system bath coupling the dissipative environment has detrimental effects on the
annealing results, we show that in the intermediate coupling regime, the phonon
bath seems to speed up the annealing at low temperatures. This improvement in
the performance is likely not due to thermal fluctuation but rather arises from
a correlated spin-bath state and persists even at zero temperature. This result
may pave the way to a new scenario in which, by appropriately engineering the

the reliability of these estimates and of the SLODAR technique applied to such

from GeMS with those obtained with the atmospherical model Meso-Nh on a rich
statistical sample of nights. It has been previously proved that, the latter
technique, provided an excellent agreement with a large sample of
radiosoundings both, in statistical terms and on individual flights. It can be
considered, therefore, as an independent reference. The excellent agreement
between GeMS measurements and the model that we find in this study, proves the
robustness of the SLODAR approach. To by-pass the complex procedures necessary
to achieve automatic measurements of the wind with GeMS, we propose a simple
automatic method to monitor nightly WS and WD using the Meso-Nh model

technique via Object-based low rank tensor decomposition (RoMIO). We
demonstrate that the filtered InSAR phase stacks can improve the accuracy of
geophysical parameters estimated via conventional multipass InSAR techniques,
e.g. PSI, by a factor of ten to thirty in typical settings. The proposed method
is particularly effective against outliers, such as pixels with unmodeled
phases. These merits in turn can effectively reduce the number of images
required for a reliable estimation. The promising performance of the proposed
method is demonstrated using high-resolution TerraSAR-X image stacks.

  analysis",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously
seeking privacy and anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced
to provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its
pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means
historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. We
investigate the feasibility of deanonymizing users of Tor hidden services who
rely on Bitcoin as a payment method by exploiting public information leaked
from online social networks, the Blockchain, and onion websites. This, for
example, allows an adversary to link a user with @alice Twitter address to a
Tor hidden service with private.onion address by finding at least one past
transaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin
addresses.
  To demonstrate the feasibility of this deanonymization attack, we carried out
a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled
1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled
5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique
Bitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an
online identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the
transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 Tor
hidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk
Road. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the
implications of the resulting information leakage on user anonymity. In
particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should always be considered
exploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is
especially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect
privacy and anonymity.

combination of high carrier mobility and optoelectronic properties tunable via
quantum confinement. In principle, maximizing carrier mobility entails crossing
the insulator-metal transition (IMT), where carriers become delocalized. A
recent theoretical study predicted that this transition occurs at n\rho^3 ~
0.3, where n is the carrier density and \rho is the interparticle contact
radius. In this work, we satisfy this criterion in networks of
plasma-synthesized ZnO NCs by using intense pulsed light (IPL) annealing to
tune n and \rho independently. IPL applied to as-deposited NCs increases \rho
by inducing sintering, and IPL applied after the NCs are coated with Al2O3 by
atomic layer deposition increases n by removing electron-trapping surface
hydroxyls. This procedure does not substantially alter NC size or composition
and is potentially applicable to a wide variety of nanomaterials. As we
increase n\rho^3 to at least twice the predicted critical value, we observe
conductivity scaling consistent with arrival at the critical region of a
continuous quantum phase transition. This allows us to determine the critical
behavior of the dielectric constant and electron localization length at the
IMT. However, our samples remain on the insulating side of the critical region,
which suggests that the critical value of n\rho^3 may in fact be significantly
higher than 0.3.

simulations to find out if evolution toward high dust-to-gas ratios can occur
in a regime of well-coupled grains with low Stokes numbers

RoSSBi, to overcome the short timesteps occurring for small grain sizes. We
discover that the linear capture phase occurs self-similarly for all grain
sizes, with an intrinsic timescale (characterizing the vortex lifetime) scaling
as $1/St$. After vortex dissipation, the formation of a {{global active dust
ring}} is a generic outcome confirming our previous results obtained for larger
grains. We propose a scenario in which, irrespective of grain size, multiple
pathways can lead to local dust-to-gas ratios of order unity and above on
relatively short timescales, $< 10^5$ yr, in the presence of a vortex, even
with $St=10^{-3}$. When $St>10^{-2}$, the vortex is quickly dissipated by
two-fluid instabilities, and large dust density enhancements form in the global
dust ring. When $St<10^{-2}$, the vortex is resistant to destabilization. As a
result, dust concentrations occur locally due to turbulence developing inside
the vortex. Whatever the Stokes number, dust-to-gas ratios in the range $1-10$,
a necessary condition to trigger a subsequent streaming instability, or even a
direct gravitational instability of the dust clumps, appears to be an
inevitable outcome. Although quantitative connections with other instabilities
still need to be made, we argue that our results support a new scenario of

important research field since one needs to better understand the challenges of

intra-urban structure. In contrast, the monocentric model of Alonso provides a
residential choice-based theory to urban density profiles. However, it is
silent about how these profiles scale with population, thus preventing
empirical scaling studies to anchor in a strong micro-economic theory. This
paper bridges this gap by introducing power laws for land, income and transport
cost in the Alonso model. From this augmented model, we derive the conditions
at which the equilibrium urban structure matches recent empirical findings
about the scaling of urban land and population density profiles in European
cities. We find that the Alonso model is theoretically compatible with the
observed scaling of population density profiles and satisfactorily represents
European cities. This compatibility however challenges current empirical
understanding of wage and transport cost elasticities with population, and
requires a scaling of the housing land profile that is different from the
observed. Our results call for revisiting theories about land development and
housing processes as well as the empirics of agglomeration benefits and

unlike currently available mathematical frameworks, the proposed analytical
formulation depends on the transmit power and deployment density of the base
stations. This is obtained by generalizing the definition of coverage
probability and by accounting for the sensitivity of the receiver not only
during the decoding of information data, but during the cell association phase
as well. Based on the new formulation of the potential spectral efficiency, the
energy efficiency (bit/Joule) is given in a tractable closed-form formula. An
optimization problem is formulated and is comprehensively studied. It is
mathematically proved, in particular, that the energy efficiency is a unimodal
and strictly pseudo-concave function in the transmit power, given the density
of the base stations, and in the density of the base stations, given the
transmit power. Under these assumptions, therefore, a unique transmit power and
density of the base stations exist, which maximize the energy efficiency.
Numerical results are illustrated in order to confirm the obtained findings and
to prove the usefulness of the proposed framework for optimizing the network

the strength of unlock authentication, focusing on Android's graphical unlock
patterns. We conducted an online study with Amazon Mechanical Turk ($N=750$)
using self-reported unlock authentication choices, as well as Likert scale
agreement/disagreement responses to a set of seven privacy/security prompts. We
then analyzed the responses in multiple dimensions, including a straight
average of the Likert responses as well as using Principle Component Analysis
to expose latent factors. We found that responses to two of the seven questions
proved relevant and significant. These two questions considered attitudes
towards general concern for data stored on mobile devices, and attitudes
towards concerns for unauthorized access by known actors. Unfortunately, larger
conclusions cannot be drawn on the efficacy of the broader set of questions for
exposing connections between unlock authentication strength (Pearson Rank
$r=-0.08$, $p<0.1$). However, both of our factor solutions exposed differences
in responses for demographics groups, including age, gender, and residence

perceptions of privacy/security on mobile devices and the perceived threats
therein, but more research is needed, particularly on developing better survey

rotation, while these planets are usually assumed to be locked into spin-orbit
synchronization with their host star. In this work, our goal is to characterize
the tidal response of a rotating hot Jupiter to the tidal semidiurnal thermal
forcing of its host star, by identifying the structure of tidal waves
responsible for variation of mass distribution, their dependence on the tidal
frequency and their ability to generate strong zonal flows. We develop an ab
initio global modeling that generalizes the early approach of Arras & Socrates
(2010) to rotating and non-adiabatic planets. We derive analytically the torque
exerted on the body and the associated timescales of evolution, as well as the
equilibrium tidal response of the atmosphere in the zero-frequency limit.
Finally, we integrate numerically the equations of thermal tides for three
cases including dissipation and rotation step by step. The resonances
associated with tidally generated gravito-inertial waves amplify significantly
the resulting tidal torque in the range 1-30 days. This torque can drive
globally the atmosphere into asynchronous rotation, as its sign depends on the
tidal frequency. The resonant behaviour of the tidal response is enhanced by
rotation, which couples the forcing to several Hough modes in the general case,
while the radiative cooling tends to regularize it and diminish its amplitude.

aim is to obtain an upper bound for $\dim M$ in terms of $r$ and $n$ under
various hypotheses. As a sample of what we prove, we mention the following.
Suppose that $m$ is the largest integer that occurs as the rank of an element
of $M$. Then if $m\leq \lceil n/2\rceil$ and $|K|\geq m+1$, we have $\dim M\leq
rn$. The case $r=1$ corresponds to a constant rank space and it is conjectured
that $\dim M\leq n$ when $M$ is a constant rank $m$ space and $|K|\geq m+1$. We
prove that the dimension bound for a constant rank $m$ space $M$ holds provided
$|K|\geq m+1$ and either $K$ is finite or $K$ has characteristic different from
2 and $M$ consists of symmetric forms. In general, we show that if $M$ is a
constant rank $m$ subspace and $|K|\geq m+1$, then $\dim M\leq \max\,(n,2m-1)$.
We also provide more detailed results about constant rank subspaces over finite

and ~ 140 meV/% for uniaxial compressive strain, representing the most
pronounced uniaxial strain-induced bandgap strain coefficient experimentally
reported in two-dimensional materials.We developed a theoretical understanding
of the strain-induced bandgap change through first-principles DFT and GW
calculations. We also confirmed the bandgap change by photoconductivity
measurements using excitation light with different photon energies. The highly
tunable bandgap of InSe in the infrared regime should enable a wide range of
applications, including electro-mechanical, piezoelectric and optoelectronic
devices.

$^{15}$N fractionation. We do not find any evolutionary trend of the
$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio from both the $^{15}$NNH$^+$ and N$^{15}$NH$^+$
isotopologues. Therefore, our findings confirm that, during the formation of a
Sun-like star, the core evolution is irrelevant in the fractionation of
$^{15}$N. The independence of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio with time, found also
in high-mass star-forming cores, indicates that the enrichment in $^{15}$N
revealed in comets and protoplanetary disks is unlikely to happen at core
scales. Nevertheless, we have firmly confirmed the evolutionary trend expected
for the H/D ratio, with the N$_2$H$^+$/N$_2$D$^+$ ratio decreasing before the
pre-stellar core phase, and increasing monotonically during the protostellar
phase. We have also confirmed clearly that the two fractionation mechanisms are

  shortened for ArXiv",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Selection HHs are randomised search methodologies which choose and execute
heuristics during the optimisation process from a set of low-level heuristics.
A machine learning mechanism is generally used to decide which low-level
heuristic should be applied in each decision step. In this paper we analyse
whether sophisticated learning mechanisms are always necessary for HHs to
perform well. To this end we consider the most simple HHs from the literature
and rigorously analyse their performance for the LeadingOnes function. Our
analysis shows that the standard Simple Random, Permutation, Greedy and Random
Gradient HHs show no signs of learning. While the former HHs do not attempt to
learn from the past performance of low-level heuristics, the idea behind the
Random Gradient HH is to continue to exploit the currently selected heuristic
as long as it is successful. Hence, it is embedded with a reinforcement
learning mechanism with the shortest possible memory. However, the probability
that a promising heuristic is successful in the next step is relatively low
when perturbing a reasonable solution to a combinatorial optimisation problem.
We generalise the simple Random Gradient HH so success can be measured over a
fixed period of time tau, instead of a single iteration. For LO we prove that
the Generalised Random Gradient HH can learn to adapt the neighbourhood size of
RLS to optimality during the run. We prove it has the best possible performance
achievable with the low-level heuristics. We also prove that the performance of
the HH improves as the number of low-level local search heuristics to choose
from increases. Finally, we show that the advantages of GRG over RLS and EAs
using standard bit mutation increase if the anytime performance is considered.
Experimental analyses confirm these results for different problem sizes.

that these Kagome lattices offer a controllable way to realize robust flat
bands sufficiently close to the Fermi level. Upon hole doping, they split into
spin-polarized bands at different energies to result in a flat-band
ferromagnetism. At a half filling, this splitting reaches its highest level of
768 meV. At smaller fillings, e.g., when {\nu}=1/6, on the other hand, a Wigner
crystal spontaneously forms, where the electrons form closed loops localized on
the grid points of a regular triangular lattice. It breaks the translational
symmetry of the original Kagome lattice. We further show that the Kagome
lattices exhibit good mechanical stabilities, based on which a possible route
for experimental realization of the Kagome graphene is also proposed.

people as a friendly gesture to express trust and respect, or form a mutual
agreement. In this paper, we show that such physical contact can be used to
bootstrap secure cyber contact between the smart devices worn by users. The key
observation is that during handshaking, although belonged to two different
users, the two hands involved in the shaking events are often rigidly
connected, and therefore exhibit very similar motion patterns. We propose a
novel Shake-n-Shack system, which harvests motion data during user handshaking
from the wrist worn smart devices such as smartwatches or fitness bands, and
exploits the matching motion patterns to generate symmetric keys on both
parties. The generated keys can be then used to establish a secure
communication channel for exchanging data between devices. This provides a much
more natural and user-friendly alternative for many applications, e.g.
exchanging/sharing contact details, friending on social networks, or even
making payments, since it doesn't involve extra bespoke hardware, nor require
the users to perform pre-defined gestures. We implement the proposed
Shake-n-Shack system on off-the-shelf smartwatches, and extensive evaluation
shows that it can reliably generate 128-bit symmetric keys just after around 1s
of handshaking (with success rate >99%), and is resilient to real-time
mimicking attacks: in our experiments the Equal Error Rate (EER) is only 1.6%

extremely lightweight, and is able to run in-situ on the resource-constrained

sizeable difference between data and statistical calculations in Pb+Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV for proton and antiproton yields
\cite{53}, where a deviation of 2.7 $\sigma$ was claimed by the ALICE

is in line with the observation that no substantial deviation between the data
and statistical hadronization model (SHM) calculations is seen for
antihyperons, since according to the PHSD analysis the antihyperons should be
modified by the same amount as antiprotons. As the PHSD results for particle
ratios are in line with the ALICE data (within error bars) this might point
towards a deviation from statistical equilibrium in the hadronization (at least
for protons/antiprotons). Furthermore, we find that the $B {\bar B}

flowing fibrils. It is found that the rotary diffusion process of CNF occurs at
multiple time scales, where the fastest scale seems to be dependent on the
deformation history of the dispersion before the stop. At the same time, the
hypothesis that rotary diffusion is dependent on the initial ODF does not hold
as the same distribution can result in different diffusion time scales. The
rotary diffusion is found to be faster in flows dominated by shear compared to
pure extensional flows. Furthermore, the experimental setup can be used to
quickly characterize the dynamic properties of flowing CNF and thus aid in
determining the quality of the dispersion and its usability in material
processes.

communication motivates the utilization of large-scale antenna arrays for
achieving highly directional beamforming. However, the high cost and power
consumption of RF chains stands in the way of adoption of the optimal
fullydigital precoding in large-array systems. To reduce the number of RF
chains while still maintaining the spatial multiplexing gain of large-array,
hybrid precoding architecture has been proposed for mmWave systems and received
considerable interest in both industry and academia. However, the optimal
hybrid precoding design has not been fully understood, especially for the
multi-user MIMO case. This paper is the first work that directly addresses the
nonconvex hybrid precoding problem of mmWave multi-user MIMO systems (without
any approximation) by using penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. The
proposed PDD method have a guaranteed convergence to KKT solutions of the
hybrid precoding problem under a mild assumption. Simulation results show that,
even when both the transmitter and the receivers are equipped with the fewest
RF chains that are required to support multi-stream transmission, hybrid
precoding can still approach the performance of fully-digital precoding in both
the infinite resolution phase shifter case and the finite resolution phase
shifter case with several bits quantization.

coarse-graining the features of a system at a certain characteristic length,
defined as the typical length beyond which some properties are no longer
correlated. From a physics standpoint, in vitro DNA has thus a characteristic
length of 300 base pairs (bp), the Kuhn length of the molecule beyond which
correlations in its orientations are typically lost. From a biology standpoint,
in vivo DNA has a characteristic length of 1000 bp, the typical length of
genes. Since bacteria live in very different physico-chemical conditions and
since their genomes lack translational invariance, whether larger, universal
characteristic lengths exist is a non-trivial question. Here, we examine this
problem by leveraging the large number of fully sequenced genomes available in
public databases. By analyzing GC content correlations and the evolutionary
conservation of gene contexts (synteny) in hundreds of bacterial chromosomes,
we conclude that a fundamental characteristic length around 10-20 kb can be
defined. This characteristic length reflects elementary structures involved in
the coordination of gene expression, which are present all along the genome of
nearly all bacteria. Technically, reaching this conclusion required us to
implement methods that are insensitive to the presence of large idiosyncratic
genomic features, which may co-exist along these fundamental universal
structures.

probe it with a single photon and analyze the reflected signals. The efficiency
of such a conventional detection scheme can potentially be enhanced by the
method of quantum illumination, where entanglement is exploited to break the
classical limits. The question is, what is the optimal quantum state that
allows us to achieve the detection limit with a minimal error? Here we address
this question for discrete signals, by deriving a complete and general set of
analytic solutions for the whole parameter space, which can be classified into
three distinct regions, in the form of phase diagrams for both conventional and
quantum illumination. Interestingly, whenever the reflectivity of the target is
less than some critical values, all received signals become useless, which is
true even if entangled resources are employed. However, there does exist a
region where quantum illumination can provide advantages over conventional
illumination; there, the optimal signal state is an entangled state with an
entanglement spectrum inversely proportional to the spectrum of the
environmental state. These results not only impose fundamental limits in
applications such as quantum radars, but also suggest how to become immune
against the attack of minimally-invasive detection.

higher-order quantum processes in which the operations performed by separate
parties cannot be ascribed a definite causal order. Some of these processes are
believed to have a physical realization in standard quantum mechanics via
coherent control of the times of the operations. A prominent example is the
quantum SWITCH, which was recently demonstrated experimentally. However, the
interpretation of such experiments as realizations of a process with indefinite
causal structure as opposed to some form of simulation of such a process has
remained controversial. Where exactly are the local operations of the parties
in such an experiment? On what spaces do they act given that their times are
indefinite? Can we probe them directly rather than assume what they ought to be
based on heuristic considerations? How can we reconcile the claim that these
operations really take place, each once as required, with the fact that the
structure of the presumed process implies that they cannot be part of any
acyclic circuit? Here, I offer a precise answer to these questions: the input
and output systems of the operations in such a process are generally nontrivial
subsystems of Hilbert spaces that are tensor products of Hilbert spaces
associated with systems at different times---a fact that is directly
experimentally verifiable. With respect to these time-delocalized subsystems,
the structure of the process is one of a circuit with a causal cycle. I also
identify a whole class of isometric processes, of which the quantum SWITCH is a
special case, that admit a physical realization on time-delocalized subsystems.
These results unveil a novel structure within quantum mechanics, which may have
important implications for physics and information processing.

many astrophysical applications and cosmological probes including weak
gravitational lensing. The PSF smears the image of any recorded object and
therefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties of galaxies
from astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the
dominant sources of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid
biases in cosmological parameters. Recently, forward modeling approaches to
calibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo Control Loops ($MCCL$)
framework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating a
large amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast
yet have realistic properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence,
such forward modeling approaches require a very flexible PSF model, which is
quick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably from survey
data. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast
deep-learning method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our
approach on publicly available SDSS data. We extract the most important
features of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis. Next, we
construct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring
that it captures these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network
to estimate the free parameters of the model from noisy images of the PSF. This
allows us to render a model image of each star, which we compare to the SDSS
stars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is
able to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the
speed of both the model evaluation and the parameter estimation, offers good
prospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$ framework.

most catastrophic effect, to the rearrangement of the fluid into clusters of
nucleons. A similar process may occur in a single atomic nucleus undergoing a
violent perturbation, like in heavy-ion collisions tracked in particle
accelerators at around 30 to 50 MeV per nucleon: in this conditions, after the
initial collision shock, the nucleus expands and then clusterises into several
smaller nuclear fragments.
  Microscopically, when violent perturbation are applied to nuclear matter, a
process of clusterisation arises from the combination of several fluctuation
modes of large-amplitude where neutrons and protons may oscillate in phase or
out of phase. The imposed perturbation leads to conditions of instability, the
wavelengths which are the most amplified have sizes comparable to small atomic
nuclei. We found that these conditions, explored in heavy-ion collisions,
correspond to the splitting of a nucleus into fragments ranging from Oxygen to
Neon in a time interval shorter than one zeptosecond (10$^{-21}$s). From the
out-of-phase oscillations of neutrons and protons another property arises, the
smaller fragments belonging to a more volatile phase get more neutron enriched:
in the heavy-ion collision case this process, called distillation, reflects in
the isotopic distributions of the fragments.
  The resulting dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions is an improvement
with respect to more usual statistical approaches, based on the equilibrium
assumption. It allows in fact to characterise also the very fast early stages
of the collision process which are out of equilibrium. Such dynamical
description is the core of the Boltzmann-Langevin One Body (BLOB) model, which
unifies in a common description fluctuations in nuclear matter and the
disintegration of nuclei into nuclear fragments.

their approach is analyzed on the basis of heat flux data from a Vlasov

driven by temperature gradients. That way, a more realistic approximation of
Landau damping in the collisionless regime is achieved. Previous issues are

assumed to be negligible due to the weak nature of the interactions between the
layers, especially when the interfaces are found incoherent. In the present
work, graphene-phosphorene vdW-heterostructures are investigated with the
Density Functional Theory (DFT). The challenge of treating nearly
incommensurate (very large) supercell in DFT is bypassed by considering
different energetic quantities in the grand canonical ensemble, alternative to
the formation energy, in order to take into account the mismatch elastic
contribution of the different layers. In the investigated heterostructures, it
is found that phosphorene contracts by ~4% in the armchair direction when
compared to its free-standing form. This large contraction leads to important
changes in term of electronic properties, with the direct electronic optical
transition of phosphorene becoming indirect in specific vdW-heterostructures.
More generally, such a contraction indicates strong substrate effects in
supported or encapsulated phosphorene -neglected hitherto- and paves the way to
substrate-controlled stress- tronic in such 2D crystal. In addition, the
stability of these vdW-heterostructures are investigated as a function of the
rotation angle between the layers and as a function of the stacking
composition. The alignment of the specific crystalline directions of graphene
and phosphorene is found energetically favored. In parallel, several several
models based on DFT-estimated quantities are presented; they allow notably a
better understanding of the global mutual accommodation of 2D materials in
their corresponding interfaces, that is predicted to be non-negligible even in

level. The time variability of $G$ will affect the orbital motion of a
millisecond pulsar in a binary system and cause a tiny difference between the
orbital period-dependent measurement of the kinematic distance and the direct
measurement of the annual parallax distance. PSR J0437$-$4715 is the nearest
millisecond pulsar and the brightest at radio. To explore the feasibility of
achieving a parallax distance accuracy of one light-year, comparable to the
recent timing result, with the technique of differential astrometry, we
searched for compact radio sources quite close to PSR J0437$-$4715. Using
existing data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, we detected two sources with flat spectra, relatively stable flux
densities of 0.9 and 1.0 mJy at 8.4 GHz and separations of 13 and 45 arcsec.
With a network consisting of the Long Baseline Array and the Kunming 40-m radio
telescope, we found that both sources have a point-like structure and a
brightness temperature of $\geq$10$^7$ K. According to these radio inputs and
the absence of counterparts in the other bands, we argue that they are most
likely the compact radio cores of extragalactic active galactic nuclei rather
than Galactic radio stars. The finding of these two radio active galactic
nuclei will enable us to achieve a sub-pc distance accuracy with the in-beam
phase-referencing very-long-baseline interferometric observations and provide
one of the most stringent constraints on the time variability of $G$ in the
near future.

simulations of the ultrafast electron dynamics of photoexcited donor-C60
complexes modeled by a Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian. The NEGF results are
compared to mean-field Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to disentangle the role
of correlations. Initial benchmarking against numerically highly accurate
time-dependent Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations verifies the
accuracy of NEGF. We then find that charge-transfer (CT) excitons partially
decay into charge separated (CS) states if dynamical non-local correlation
corrections are included. This CS process occurs in ~10 fs after
photoexcitation. In contrast, the probability of exciton recombination is
almost 100% in HF simulations. These results are largely unaffected by nuclear
vibrations; the latter become however essential whenever level misalignment
hinders the CT process. The robust nature of our findings indicate that
ultrafast CS driven by correlation-induced decoherence may occur in many
organic nanoscale systems, but it will only be correctly predicted by
theoretical treatments that include time-nonlocal correlations.

  Time Using Mobile Location Data",,,,,"econ.EM cs.AI stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper analyzes consumer choices over lunchtime restaurants using data
from a sample of several thousand anonymous mobile phone users in the San
Francisco Bay Area. The data is used to identify users' approximate typical
morning location, as well as their choices of lunchtime restaurants. We build a
model where restaurants have latent characteristics (whose distribution may
depend on restaurant observables, such as star ratings, food category, and
price range), each user has preferences for these latent characteristics, and
these preferences are heterogeneous across users. Similarly, each item has
latent characteristics that describe users' willingness to travel to the
restaurant, and each user has individual-specific preferences for those latent
characteristics. Thus, both users' willingness to travel and their base utility
for each restaurant vary across user-restaurant pairs. We use a Bayesian
approach to estimation. To make the estimation computationally feasible, we
rely on variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution, as
well as stochastic gradient descent as a computational approach. Our model
performs better than more standard competing models such as multinomial logit
and nested logit models, in part due to the personalization of the estimates.
We analyze how consumers re-allocate their demand after a restaurant closes to
nearby restaurants versus more distant restaurants with similar
characteristics, and we compare our predictions to actual outcomes. Finally, we
show how the model can be used to analyze counterfactual questions such as what
type of restaurant would attract the most consumers in a given location.

big bang model, together with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic
microwave background. Now that the number of neutrino families and the baryonic
densities have been fixed by laboratory measurements or CMB observations, the
model has no free parameter and its predictions are rigid. Departure from its
predictions could provide hints or constraints on new physics or astrophysics
in the early universe. Precision on primordial abundances deduced from
observations have recently been drastically improved and reach the percent
level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly, the BBN predictions should
reach the same level of precision. For most isotopes, the dominant sources of
uncertainty come from those on the laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This
article focuses on helium-4 whose predicted primordial abundance depends
essentially on weak interactions which control the neutron-proton ratio. The
rates of the various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally
measured neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we
thoroughly investigate here. They are the radiative, zero-temperature,
corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite temperature radiative
corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are for the first
time all included and calculated in a self consistent way, allowing to take
into account the correlations between them, and verifying that all satisfy
detailed balance. The helium-4 predicted mass fraction is $0.24709\pm0.00017$.
In addition, we provide a Mathematica code (PRIMAT) that incorporates, not only
these corrections but also a full network of reactions, using the best
available thermonuclear reaction rates, allowing the predictions of primordial
abundances up to the CNO region.

an addition, for the t-hull number of $G\boxtimes H $ we show that $th(G

play an important role in different convexity types, we show that no vertex of

constraints: aesthetic, geometric, usability, lighting, safety, etc. At the
same time, there are often a multiplicity of diverse designs that can meet
these constraints equally well. Architects must use their skills and artistic
vision to explore these rich but highly constrained design spaces. A number of
computer-aided design tools use automation to provide useful analytical data
and optimal designs with respect to certain fitness criteria. However, this
automation can come at the expense of a designer's creative control.
  We propose uDOME, a user-in-the-loop system for computer-aided design
exploration that balances automation and control by efficiently exploring,
analyzing, and filtering the space of environment layouts to better inform an
architect's decision-making. At each design iteration, uDOME provides a set of
diverse designs which satisfy user-defined constraints and optimality criteria
within a user defined parameterization of the design space. The user then
selects a design and performs a similar optimization with the same or different
parameters and objectives. This exploration process can be repeated as many
times as the designer wishes. Our user studies indicates that \DOME, with its
diversity-based approach, improves the efficiency and effectiveness of even
novice users with minimal training, without compromising the quality of their

classification of taxonomic entries was chosen as an exemplary use case. In
order to automate the dataset creation, a prototype was conceptualized and
implemented after working out knowledge basics and analyzing requirements for
it. It makes use of an pre-trained abstract artificial intelligence which is
able to sort out images that do not contain the desired content. Subsequent to
the implementation and the automated dataset creation resulting from it, an
evaluation was performed. Other, manually collected datasets were compared to
the one the prototype produced in means of specifications and accuracy. The
results were more than satisfactory and showed that automatically generating a
