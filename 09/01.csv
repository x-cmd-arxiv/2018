semi-Dirac material under the influence of an external time dependent periodic
driving field (irradiation) by means of Floquet theory. We explore the
inelastic scattering mechanism between different side-bands, induced by
irradiation, by using Floquet scattering matrix approach. The scattering
probabilities between two nearest side-bands depend monotonically on the
strength of the amplitude of the irradiation. The external irradiation induces
gap into the band dispersion which is strongly dependent on the angular
orientation of momentum. Although, the high frequency limit indicates that the
gap opening does not occur in an irradiated semi-Dirac material, a careful
analysis of the full band structure beyond this limit reveals that gap opening
indeed appears for higher values of momentum (away from the Dirac point).
Furthermore, the angular dependent dynamical gap is also present which cannot
be captured within the high frequency approximation. The contrasting features
of irradiated semi-Dirac material, in comparison to irradiated graphene, can be
probed via the behavior of conductance. The latter exhibits the appearance of
non-zero conductance dips due to the gap opening in Floquet band spectrum.
Moreover, by considering a nanoribbon geometry of such material, we also show
that it can host a pair of edge modes which are fully decoupled from the bulk,
which is in contrast to the case of graphene nanoribbon where the edge modes
are coupled to the bulk. We also investigate that if the nanoribbon of this
material is exposed to the external irradiation, decoupled edge modes penetrate
into the bulk.

asymptotic results about estimators for tail related quantities. Such

be vastly different for estimators based on the block maxima (BM) method or the
peak-over-threshold (POT) approach. In this paper we provide details on the
relationship between typical second order conditions for BM and POT methods in
the multivariate case. We show that the two conditions typically imply each
other, but with a possibly different second order parameter. The latter implies
that, depending on the data generating process, one of the two methods can
attain faster convergence rates than the other. The class of multivariate
Archimax copulas is examined in detail; we find that this class contains models
for which the second order parameter is smaller for the BM method and vice

by preparing several states of an input probe that then evolve under the action
of the quantum channel corresponding to the progress. The final states of the
probe are reconstructed by means of state tomography. An alternative is offered
by ancilla-assisted process tomography: a single probe-ancilla state is used,
and the correlations existing between probe and ancilla are exploited to fully
reconstruct the information on the channel. In order for ancilla-assisted
process tomography to be possible, the probe-ancilla input state does not need
to be entangled, but still needs to have maximal operator Schmidt rank. Here we
establish and analyze a framework for process tomography that interpolates
between these two methods, aiming at exploiting any correlations that may exist
between probe and ancilla to allow process tomography with as few input
preparations as possible, when the probe-ancilla state may be
operator-Schmidt-rank deficient. The main object of our investigation is the
minimal number of initial local operations on the input probe for a given
starting probe-ancilla state that are needed to allow process tomography. We
prove that such a number scales inversely proportional to the operator Schmidt
rank of the input probe-ancilla state for arbitrary local input processing. We
also provide results for the case where this initial local processing is
restricted to be a unitary rotation, in particular showing that the mentioned
scaling is satisfied for pure input entangled states, and that in the case of
mixed states there might be extreme cases where the fixed input probe-ancilla
state provides information on a $\approx d^2/2$-dimensional subspace of the
operator space and a single additional input unitary rotation allows process
tomography.

targets display a centrally concentrated distribution, with solid evidence of
ellipsoidal symmetry--similar to the RR Lyrae (RRL) ellipsoid--and a few halo
outliers up to >100 kpc. We obtain a distance from the Galactic center of
R0=8.46+-0.03(stat.)+-0.11(syst.) kpc. We also find evidence that the bulge
T2Cs belong to a kinematically hot population, as the tangential velocity
components (sigma vl*=104.2+-3.0 km/s and sigma vb=96.8+-5.5 km/s) agree within
1.2sigma. Moreover, the difference between absolute and relative PM is in good
agreement with the PM of Sgr A* from VLBA measures. We conclude that bulge T2Cs
display an ellipsoidal distribution and have kinematics similar to RRLs, which
are other tracers of the old, low-mass stellar population. T2Cs also provide an
estimate of R0 that agrees excellently well with the literature, taking account
of the reddening law.

communication at a rate of 500 kbps performs reliably within a tunable
bandwidth of 200 MHz at carrier 10.22 GHz and a bit error rate (BER) appears

the density of the probe laser at the center frequency of RF-induced symmetric

signal distortion and the modulating signal is able to be decoded as fast as up

hypergraph is Berge-$F$-free if it does not contain a Berge copy of $F$. We
denote the maximum number of hyperedges in an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform
Berge-$F$-free hypergraph by $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,\textrm{Berge-}F).$
  In this paper we prove two general lemmas concerning the maximum size of a

several old results. In particular, we give bounds on
$\mathrm{ex}_r(n,\textrm{Berge-}F)$ when $F$ is a path (reproving a result of

\""Ozkahya), a theta graph (improving a result of He and Tait), or a $K_{2,t}$

  We also establish new bounds when $F$ is a clique (which implies extensions
of results by Maherani and Shahsiah and by Gy\'arf\'as) and when $F$ is a

breathing. The severity of OSA can lead to many symptoms such as sudden cardiac
death (SCD). Polysomnography (PSG) is a gold standard for OSA diagnosis. It
records many signals from the patient's body for at least one whole night and
calculates the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) which is the number of apnea or
hypopnea incidences per hour. This value is then used to classify patients into
OSA severity levels. However, it has many disadvantages and limitations.
Consequently, we proposed a novel methodology of OSA severity classification
using a Deep Learning approach. We focused on the classification between normal
subjects (AHI $<$ 5) and severe OSA patients (AHI $>$ 30). The 15-second raw
ECG records with apnea or hypopnea events were used with a series of deep
learning models. The main advantages of our proposed method include easier data
acquisition, instantaneous OSA severity detection, and effective feature
extraction without domain knowledge from expertise. To evaluate our proposed
method, 545 subjects of which 364 were normal and 181 were severe OSA patients
obtained from the MrOS sleep study (Visit 1) database were used with the k-fold
cross-validation technique. The accuracy of 79.45\% for OSA severity
classification with sensitivity, specificity, and F-score was achieved. This is
significantly higher than the results from the SVM classifier with RR Intervals
and ECG derived respiration (EDR) signal feature extraction. The promising
result shows that this proposed method is a good start for the detection of OSA
severity from a single channel ECG which can be obtained from wearable devices
at home and can also be applied to near real-time alerting systems such as
before SCD occurs.

ones with an added vector potential. In lattice systems it is not so clear how
to do this, because there is no continuous translation symmetry, and hence
there are no momenta. Moreover, when time is also discrete, as in quantum walk
systems, there is no Hamiltonian, only a unitary step operator. We present a
unified framework of gauge theory for such discrete systems, keeping a close
analogy to the continuum case. In particular, we show how to implement minimal
coupling in a way that automatically guarantees unitary dynamics. The scheme
works in any lattice dimension, for any number of internal degree of freedom,
for walks that allow jumps to a finite neighborhood rather than to nearest
neighbours, is naturally gauge invariant, and prepares possible extensions to

smuon but a heavy stau, which predict a large muon g-2 but a small
$Br(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$; (iii) To obtain the right DM relic density, the
annihilation mechanisms should be stau exchange, stau coannihilation, chargino
coannihilation, slepton annihilation and the combination of two or three of
them; (iv) To obtain the right DM relic density, the spin-independent

three types of brain responses: non-imagery EEG (\textit{background EEG}),
(\textit{pure imagery}) EEG, and EEG during the transitional period between
background EEG and pure imagery (\textit{transitional imagery}). The study of
transitional imagery signals should provide greater insight into real-world
scenarios. It may be inferred that pure imagery and transitional EEG are high

are compared to the conventional approach for motor imagery-BCI, namely the
common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine
(SVM) for classification (CSP-SVM). Under a joint training scheme, pure and
transitional imagery are treated as the same class, while background EEG is
another class. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate whether the joint
training scheme significantly improves the performance task of classifying pure

$i$ magnitude in the range $-29.67\leq M_i(z=2)\leq-27.03$, and different
levels of radio-loudness. This sample unveils diverse specimens of Ly$\alpha$
nebulosities extending for tens of kiloparsecs around these quasars (on average
out to a maximum projected distance of 80 kpc) above a surface brightness
SB$>8.8\times10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ ($2\sigma$). The
bulk of the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is within R<50 kpc, and is
characterized by relatively quiescent kinematics, with average velocity
dispersions of $\langle \sigma_{\rm Ly\alpha}\rangle < 400$~km~s$^{-1}$.
Therefore, the motions within all these Ly$\alpha$ nebulosities have amplitudes
consistent with gravitational motions expected in dark matter halos hosting
quasars at these redshifts, possibly reflecting the complexity in propagating a
fast wind on large scales. Our current data suggest a combination of
photoionization and resonant scattering as powering mechanisms of the
Ly$\alpha$ emission. We discover the first $z\sim3$ ELAN, which confirms a very
low probability ($\sim1\%$) of occurrence of such extreme systems at these
cosmic epochs. Finally, we discuss the redshift evolution currently seen in
extended Ly$\alpha$ emission around radio-quiet quasars from $z\sim3$ to
$z\sim2$, concluding that it is possibly linked to a decrease of cool gas mass

extremely important physical property in geophysics field. However, the exact
value of electronic thermal conductivity of iron under extreme pressure and
temperature still remains poorly known both experimentally and theoretically. A
few recent experimental studies measured the value of the electronic thermal
conductivity directly and some theoretical works have predicted the electronic
thermal conductivity of iron at Earth's core conditions based on the
Kubo-Greenwood method. However, these results differ largely from each other. A
very recent research has confirmed that for iron at Earth's core conditions the
strength of electron-electron scattering could be comparable to that for
electron-phonon scattering, meaning that the electron-electron scattering
should also be considered when evaluating the electronic thermal conductivity
in the Earth's core situations. Here, by utilizing a newly developed
methodology based on direct non-equilibrium $ab~initio$ molecular dynamics
simulation coupled with the concept of electrostatic potential oscillation, we
predict the electronic thermal conductivity of iron in h.c.p phase. Our
methodology inherently includes the electron-phonon and electron-electron
interactions under extreme conditions. Our results are comparable to the
previous theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, our
methodology provides a new physical picture to describe the heat transfer
process in $\epsilon-$iron at Earth's core conditions from the electrostatic
potential oscillation point of view and offers a new approach to study thermal
transport property of pure metals in planet's cores with different temperature
and pressures.

However, the independence assumption may be unrealistic for many scenarios such
as modeling multiple time series, spatial processes, and functional data, where
the outcomes are correlated. In this paper, we introduce the generalized
probabilistic principal component analysis (GPPCA) to study the latent factor
model for multiple correlated outcomes, where each factor is modeled by a
Gaussian process. Our method generalizes the previous probabilistic formulation
of PCA (PPCA) by providing the closed-form maximum marginal likelihood
estimator of the factor loadings and other parameters. Based on the explicit
expression of the precision matrix in the marginal likelihood that we derived,
the number of the computational operations is linear to the number of output
variables. Furthermore, we also provide the closed-form expression of the
marginal likelihood when other covariates are included in the mean structure.
We highlight the advantage of GPPCA in terms of the practical relevance,
estimation accuracy and computational convenience. Numerical studies of
simulated and real data confirm the excellent finite-sample performance of the
proposed approach.

Thermal flux from the nightside of several hot Jupiters has been measured,

about the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters. Here we show that the nightside

optically thick to outgoing longwave radiation and hence radiate at the
cloud-top temperature, and progressively disperse for planets receiving greater
incident flux. Phase curve observations at a greater range of wavelengths are
crucial to determining the extent of cloud coverage, as well as the cloud

from the centers of their host galaxies. We discover that the light curves of
TDFs from low-mass black holes ($<10^{6.5} M_\odot$) show significant late-time
flattening. Conversely, FUV light curves from high-mass black hole TDFs are
generally consistent with an extrapolation from the early-time light curve. The
observed late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for
early-time TDF light curves (i.e. reprocessing or circularization shocks), but
is instead consistent with a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk.
These disk models can only reproduce the observed FUV luminosities, however, if
they are assumed to be thermally and viscously stable, in contrast to the
simplest predictions of alpha-disk theory. For one TDF in our sample, we
measure an upper limit to the UV luminosity that is significantly lower than
expectations from theoretical modeling and an extrapolation of the early-time
light curve. This dearth of late-time emission could be due to a disk
instability/state change absent in the rest of the sample. The disk models that

spectrum has been suggested as a key observable that can be extracted from
strongly lensed images and yield important clues about the matter distribution
within the lens galaxy. We use two different $N$-body simulations from the
ETHOS framework: one with cold dark matter and another with self-interacting
dark matter and a cutoff in the initial power spectrum. Despite earlier works
that identified $ k \gtrsim 100$ kpc$^{-1}$ as the most promising scales to
learn about the particle nature of dark matter we find that even at lower
wavenumbers - which are actually within reach of observations in the near
future - we can gain important information about dark matter. Comparing the
amplitude and slope of the power spectrum on scales $0.1 \lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1}
\lesssim 10$ from lenses at different redshifts can help us distinguish between
cold dark matter and other exotic dark matter scenarios that alter the
abundance and central densities of subhalos. Furthermore, by considering the
contribution of different mass bins to the power spectrum we find that subhalos
in the mass range $10^7 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ are on average the largest
contributors to the power spectrum signal on scales $2 \lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1}
\lesssim 15$, despite the numerous subhalos with masses $> 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ in
a typical lens galaxy. Finally, by comparing the power spectra obtained from
the subhalo catalogs to those from the particle data in the simulation

a simple mathematical derivation of the assertion that introducing an
Omega-background precisely deformation quantizes this structure. We then study
the secondary product structure of extended operators, which subsumes that of
local operators but is often much richer. We calculate interesting cases of
secondary brackets of line operators in Rozansky-Witten theories and in
four-dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theories, measuring the noncommutativity

first order by the interaction radius contains the isotropic part only. It
leads to the interaction in the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. Terms existing
in the third order by the interaction radius are caused by the isotropic and
nonisotropic parts of the interaction. Each of them introduces the interaction
constant. Therefore, three interaction constants are involved in the model.
Atoms, except the alkali and alkali-earth atoms, can have anisotropic potential
of interaction, particularly it is demonstrated for the lanthanides. The
short-wavelength instability caused by the nonlocal terms appears in the
Bogoliubov spectrum. Conditions for the stable and unstable behaviour are
described. Bright solitons in the repulsive BEC are studied under influence of
the anisotropic short-range interaction in the BEC of one species. Area of

the quintic nonlinearity at the description of the bright solitons is
demonstrated either.

dense Galactic fields, to only matching 55% of the counterparts. We describe

both catalogues to discriminate between true and false counterparts. We apply

the most likely counterpart matches and their respective probabilities. We also
analyse several cases to verify the robustness of the results, highlighting
some important caveats and considerations. Finally, we discuss the effect PSF
resolution has by comparing the intra-catalogue nearest neighbour separation
distributions of a sample of likely contaminated WISE objects and their
corresponding Spitzer counterpart. We show that some WISE contaminants are
resolved in Spitzer, with smaller intra-catalogue separations. We have

main idea is to use a relation between the (numerically stiff) linearized
collision operator with the nonlinear quadratic ones, the later's stiffness can
be overcome using the BGK penalization method of Filbet and Jin for the
Boltzmann, or the linear Fokker-Planck penalization method of Jin and Yan for
the Fokker-Planck Landau equations. Such a scheme allows the computation of
multiscale collisional kinetic equations efficiently in all regimes, including
the fluid regime in which the fluid dynamic behavior can be correctly computed
even without resolving the small Knudsen number. A distinguished feature of
these schemes is that although they contain implicit terms, they can be
implemented explicitly. These schemes preserve the moments (mass, momentum and
energy) exactly thanks to the use of the macroscopic system which is naturally
in a conservative form. We further utilize this conservation property for more
general kinetic systems, using the Vlasov-Amp\'{e}re and
Vlasov-Amp\'{e}re-Boltzmann systems as examples. The main idea is to evolve
both the kinetic equation for the probability density distribution and the
moment system, the later naturally induces a scheme that conserves exactly the

background (CMB) experiments to employ ever larger focal planes, which in turn
require larger reimaging optics. Practical limits to the maximum size of these
optics motivates the development of quasi-optically-coupled (lenslet-coupled),
multi-chroic detectors. These detectors can be sensitive across a broader
bandwidth compared to waveguide-coupled detectors. However, the increase in
bandwidth comes at a cost: the lenses (up to $\sim$700 mm diameter) and
lenslets ($\sim$5 mm diameter, hemispherical lenses on the focal plane) used in
these systems are made from high-refractive-index materials (such as silicon or
amorphous aluminum oxide) that reflect nearly a third of the incident
radiation. In order to maximize the faint CMB signal that reaches the
detectors, the lenses and lenslets must be coated with an anti-reflective (AR)
material. The AR coating must maximize radiation transmission in scientifically
interesting bands and be cryogenically stable. Such a coating was developed for
the third generation camera, SPT-3G, of the South Pole Telescope (SPT)
experiment, but the materials and techniques used in the development are
general to AR coatings for mm-wave optics. The three-layer
polytetrafluoroethylene-based AR coating is broadband, inexpensive, and can be
manufactured with simple tools. The coating is field tested; AR coated focal
plane elements were deployed in the 2016-2017 austral summer and AR coated
reimaging optics were deployed in 2017-2018.

cryostats, secondary telescope optics, and readout electronics, the number of
detectors in the focal plane has increased by an order of magnitude from
previous instruments to ~16,000. The SPT-3G focal plane consists of ten
detector modules, each with an array of 269 trichroic, polarization-sensitive
pixels on a six-inch silicon wafer. Within each pixel is a broadband,
dual-polarization sinuous antenna; the signal from each orthogonal linear
polarization is divided into three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220
GHz by in-line lumped element filters and transmitted via superconducting
microstrip to Ti/Au transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers. Properties of the
TES film, microstrip filters, and bolometer island must be tightly controlled

have replaced all ten wafers in the focal plane with new detector arrays tuned
to increase mapping speed and improve overall performance. Here we discuss the

address missing data. For complete-case analysis, researchers discard all data
from any student who is missing any data. Despite its frequent use, no PER
article we reviewed that used complete-case analysis provided evidence that the
data met the assumption of missing completely at random (MCAR) necessary to
ensure accurate results. Not meeting this assumption raises the possibility
that prior studies have reported biased results with inflated gains that may
obscure differences across courses. To test this possibility, we compared the
accuracy of complete-case analysis and multiple imputation (MI) using simulated
data. We simulated the data based on prior studies such that students who
earned higher grades participated at higher rates, which made the data missing
at random (MAR). PER studies seldom use MI, but MI uses all available data, has
less stringent assumptions, and is more accurate and more statistically
powerful than complete-case analysis. Results indicated that complete-case
analysis introduced more bias than MI and this bias was large enough to obscure
differences between student populations or between courses. We recommend that
the PER community adopt the use of MI for handling missing data to improve the
accuracy in research studies.

to make a broad range of cosmological measurements. These include constraining
the effect of massive neutrinos on large-scale structure formation as well as
cleaning galactic and cosmological foregrounds from CMB polarization data in
future searches for inflationary gravitational waves. The SPT began observing

knowledge of probability and some knowledge of linear algebra. We do not assume
previous knowledge of Kalman filters or Bayes filters. This document derives an
EKF for various models of drones in 1D, 2D, and 3D. We use the EKF and notation

the EKF, and the Unscented Kalman filter [14]. The motivation behind this

derivations for a quadrotor helicopter. The goal of estimation is to infer the
drone's state (pose, velocity, acceleration, and biases) from its sensor values
and control inputs. This problem is challenging because sensors are noisy.
Additionally, because of weight and cost issues, many drones have limited
on-board computation so we want to estimate these values as quickly as
possible. The standard method for performing this method is the Extended Kalman
filter, a nonlinear extension of the Kalman filter which linearizes a nonlinear
transition and measurement model around the current state. However the
Unscented Kalman filter is better in almost every respect: simpler to
implement, more accurate to estimate, and comparable runtimes.

photonics, where PT-symmetric potential landscapes can be implemented by
appropriately distributing gain and loss. Following this approach, several
hallmark features of PT symmetry were shown, such as the existence of
non-orthogonal eigenmodes, non-reciprocal light evolution, diffusive coherent

other research fields ranging from PT-symmetric atomic diffusion,

characterization of a two-dimensional PT-symmetric system by means of photonic
waveguide lattices with judiciously designed refractive index landscape with
alternating loss. A key result of our work is the demonstration of a
non-Hermitian two-dimensional topological phase transition that coincides with
the emergence of mid-gap edge states. Our findings pave the grounds for future
investigations exploring the full potential of PT-symmetric photonics in higher

Relevance Vector Machines (RVM). This platform is able to estimate the customer

prohibitive computational burden of model training for large AMI datasets. To
achieve this objective, the large training set is decomposed and distributed
among multiple parallel learning entities. The resulting estimations from the
parallel RVMs are then combined using a game-theoretic model based on the idea
of repeated games with vector payoff. It is observed that through this approach
and by exploiting the seasonal changes in customers' behavior the accuracy of
pseudo-measurements can be considerably improved, while introducing robustness
against bad training data samples. The proposed pseudo-measurement generation
model is integrated into a DSSE using a closed-loop information system, which
takes advantage of a Branch Current State Estimator (BCSE) data to further
improve the performance of the designed machine learning framework. This method

a $\delta$ Sct-type pulsator and a thermally bloated low-mass pre-He white
dwarf (WD). Spectroscopy and time-series $BV$ photometry of V1224 Cas were
carried out. The spectroscopy reveals a spectral type of A3 for the star.
Light-curve modelling indicate that V1224 Cas is a short-period detached system
containing a possible low-mass WD with an effective temperature of about 9516
K. Based on the effective temperature and the surface gravity of the A-type
primary star from the spectroscopic results, the absolute parameters of the
components were estimated as: $M_{P}$=2.16$\pm$0.22$M_{\sun}$,
$R_{P}$=3.54$\pm$0.12$R_{\sun}$, $L_{P}$=55.9$\pm$6.9$L_{\sun}$,
$M_{S}$=0.19$\pm$0.02$M_{\sun}$, $R_{S}$=0.97$\pm$0.04$R_{\sun}$, and
$L_{S}$=6.9$\pm$0.6$L_{\sun}$. We therefore introduce V1224 Cas as a new EL
CVn-type binary candidate. The light curves in both filters all show
multi-periodic pulsations, superimposed on binary effects. We performed a
preliminary frequency analysis of the light residuals after removing the
synthetic eclipsing curve from the original observational data. The results
suggest that the rapid light variations among the light curves could be
attributed to the $\delta$ Sct-type primary component. We therefore conclude
that V1224 Cas is very likely a WD+$\delta$ Sct binary.

far below the diffraction limit is a defining paradigm in nanophotonics. An
important recent development in this field is the measurement and manipulation
of extremely confined phonon-polariton modes in polar dielectrics such as
silicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride, which pave the way for
nanophotonics and extreme light-matter interactions in the mid-IR to THz
frequency range. To further advance this promising field, it is of great
interest to predict the optical response of recently discovered and
yet-to-be-synthesized polaritonic materials alike. Here we develop a unified
framework based on quantum linear response theory to calculate the spatially
non-local dielectric function of a polar lattice in arbitrary dimensions. In
the case of a three-dimensional bulk material, the spatially local limit of our
calculation reproduces standard results for the dielectric response of a polar
lattice. Using this framework, we provide ab initio calculations of the
dielectric permittivity of important bulk polar dielectrics such as silicon
carbide and hexagonal boron nitride in good agreement with experiments. From
the ab initio theory, we are able to develop a microscopic understanding of
which phonon modes contribute to each component of the dielectric function, as
well as predict features in the dielectric function that are a result of weak
TO phonons. This formalism also identifies regime(s) where quantum nonlocal
effects may correct the phonon polariton dispersion, extremely relevant in
recent atomic-scale experiments which confine electromagnetic fields to the
scale of 1~nm. Finally, our work points the way towards first principles
descriptions of the effect of interface phonons, phonon strong coupling, and
chiral phonons on the properties of phonon polaritons.

been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted
examples aiming to mislead machine learning models. Adversarial examples can
pose potential risks on safety and security critical applications. However,
existing defense approaches are still vulnerable to attacks, especially in a
white-box attack scenario. To address this issue, we propose a new defense
approach, named MulDef, based on robustness diversity. Our approach consists of
(1) a general defense framework based on multiple models and (2) a technique
for generating these multiple models to achieve high defense capability. In
particular, given a target model, our framework includes multiple models
(constructed from the target model) to form a model family. The model family is
designed to achieve robustness diversity (i.e., an adversarial example
successfully attacking one model cannot succeed in attacking other models in
the family). At runtime, a model is randomly selected from the family to be
applied on each input example. Our general framework can inspire rich future
research to construct a desirable model family achieving higher robustness
diversity. Our evaluation results show that MulDef (with only up to 5 models in
the family) can substantially improve the target model's accuracy on
adversarial examples by 22-74% in a white-box attack scenario, while
maintaining similar accuracy on legitimate examples.

differential light curves for accurate physical starspot modeling. We use the
Sun and starspot models as a testbed to highlight some factors in this
calibration that that have not yet been treated with care. One unambiguously
successful procedure for converting a differential light curve into a light
deficit curve appears difficult to implement, but methodologies are presented
that work in many cases. The years-long time coverage of Kepler provides a
strong advantage, but unresolved issues concerning the competing and sometimes
similar effects of surface differential rotation versus spot number and size
evolution can prevent the confident recovery of correct spot covering fractions
in certain cases.
  We also consider whether faculae are detected by Kepler and/or must be
accounted for. We conclude their effects are such that absolute photometry is
not required for spot deficit calibrations. To elucidate their signature we
re-examine correlations between absolute brightness, differential variability,
and apparent spot coverage for hundreds of Kepler stars with absolute
calibrations from Montet et al. (2017). The results are similar to theirs, but
we draw somewhat different conclusions. Most of the stars in this active
solar-type sample are spot-dominated as expected. Partly because of a dearth of
longer period stars, the evidence for facular dominance in this sample is both
sparse and relatively weak. The facular population exhibits a puzzling lack of
dependence on rotation period, which raises questions about the apparent
detection of a ""facular"" signal at short periods.

  Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD) 2020",,,,"cs.ET cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resistive crossbars designed with non-volatile memory devices have emerged as
promising building blocks for Deep Neural Network (DNN) hardware, due to their
ability to compactly and efficiently realize vector-matrix multiplication
(VMM), the dominant computational kernel in DNNs. However, a key challenge with
resistive crossbars is that they suffer from a range of device and circuit
level non-idealities such as interconnect parasitics, peripheral circuits,
sneak paths, and process variations. These non-idealities can lead to errors in
VMMs, eventually degrading the DNN's accuracy. It is therefore critical to
study the impact of crossbar non-idealities on the accuracy of large-scale
DNNs. However, this is challenging because existing device and circuit models
are too slow to use in application-level evaluations.
  We present RxNN, a fast and accurate simulation framework to evaluate
large-scale DNNs on resistive crossbar systems. RxNN splits and maps the
computations involved in each DNN layer into crossbar operations, and evaluates
them using a Fast Crossbar Model (FCM) that accurately captures the errors
arising due to crossbar non-idealities while being four-to-five orders of
magnitude faster than circuit simulation. FCM models a crossbar-based VMM
operation using three stages - non-linear models for the input and output
peripheral circuits (DACs and ADCs), and an equivalent non-ideal conductance
matrix for the core crossbar array. We implement RxNN by extending the Caffe
machine learning framework and use it to evaluate a suite of six large-scale
DNNs developed for the ImageNet Challenge. Our experiments reveal that
resistive crossbar non-idealities can lead to significant accuracy degradations
(9.6%-32%) for these large-scale DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of large-scale DNNs on
resistive crossbar based hardware.

mapping approach then refines the 3D model of the entire tree row by
integrating semantic information common to both sides, and extracted using our
novel robust detection and fitting algorithms. Next, we present a vision system

challenging aspect of modelling igneous phenomena is that they range from
solid-dominated porous to liquid-dominated suspension flows and therefore
entail a wide spectrum of rheological conditions, flow speeds, and length
scales. Most previous models have been restricted to the two-phase limits of
porous melt transport in deforming, partially molten rock and crystal settling
in convecting magma bodies. The goal of this paper is to develop a framework
that can capture igneous system from source to surface at all phase proportions
including not only rock and melt but also an exsolved volatile phase. Here, we
derive an n-phase reactive transport model building on the concepts of Mixture
Theory, along with principles of Rational Thermodynamics and procedures of
Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics. Our model operates at the macroscopic system
scale and requires constitutive relations for fluxes within and transfers
between phases, which are the processes that together give rise to reactive
transport phenomena. We introduce a phase- and process-wise symmetrical
formulation for fluxes and transfers of entropy, mass, momentum, and volume,
and propose phenomenological coefficient closures that determine how fluxes and
transfers respond to mechanical and thermodynamic forces. Finally, we
demonstrate that the known limits of two-phase porous and suspension flow
emerge as special cases of our general model and discuss some ramifications for
modelling pertinent two- and three-phase flow problems in igneous systems.

stochastic and depends on the service capacity and follows a general
distribution that can differ for each facility. The service capacity is
selected from a given (bounded or unbounded) interval. The objective of our
problem is to optimize a balanced performance measure that compromises between
facility-induced and customer-related costs. Service times are represented by a
flexible location-scale stochastic model. The problem is formulated using
quadratic conic optimization. Valid inequalities and a cut-generation procedure
are developed to increase computational efficiency. A comprehensive numerical

universal amongst all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms on the input space.
We derive qualitative and quantitative approximation guarantees for this

fixing every point of the input space lying outside some compact set, and we
quantify the size of this set as a function of our model's depth. Moreover, we
show that no deep feed-forward network with commonly used activation function

calcu- lating its tertiary structure. Analysis of co-evolutionary events among
residues has been proved effective to inferring inter-residue contacts. The
Markov ran- dom field (MRF) technique, although being widely used for contact
prediction, suffers from the following dilemma: the actual likelihood function
of MRF is accurate but time-consuming to calculate, in contrast, approximations
to the actual likelihood, say pseudo-likelihood, are efficient to calculate but
inaccu- rate. Thus, how to achieve both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously
remains a challenge. In this study, we present such an approach (called clmDCA)
for contact prediction. Unlike plmDCA using pseudo-likelihood, i.e., the
product of conditional probability of individual residues, our approach uses
composite- likelihood, i.e., the product of conditional probability of all
residue pairs. Com- posite likelihood has been theoretically proved as a better
approximation to the actual likelihood function than pseudo-likelihood.
Meanwhile, composite likelihood is still efficient to maximize, thus ensuring
the efficiency of clmDCA. We present comprehensive experiments on popular
benchmark datasets, includ- ing PSICOV dataset and CASP-11 dataset, to show
that: i) clmDCA alone outperforms the existing MRF-based approaches in
prediction accuracy. ii) When equipped with deep learning technique for
refinement, the prediction ac- curacy of clmDCA was further significantly
improved, suggesting the suitability of clmDCA for subsequent refinement
procedure. We further present successful application of the predicted contacts
to accurately build tertiary structures for proteins in the PSICOV dataset.

swimmers through crowded heterogeneous environments is relevant to many natural
and engineering processes, from biofilm formation and contamination processes
to transport in soils and biomedical devices. While there has been experimental
progress, a theoretical understanding of mean transport properties in these
systems has been lacking. In this work, we apply generalized Taylor dispersion
theory to analyze the long-time statistics of an active self-propelled Brownian
particle transported under an applied flow through the interstices of a
periodic lattice that serves as an idealization of a porous medium. Our
theoretical model, which we validate against Brownian dynamics simulations, is
applied to unravel the roles of motility, fluid flow, and lattice geometry on
asymptotic mean velocity and dispersivity. In weak flows, transport is
dominated by active dispersion, which results from self-propulsion in the
presence of noise and is hindered by the obstacles that act as entropic
barriers. In strong flows, shear-induced Taylor dispersion becomes the dominant
mechanism for spreading, with pillars now acting as regions of shear production
that enhance dispersion. The interplay of these two effects leads to complex
and unexpected trends, such as a non-monotonic dependence of axial dispersivity
on flow strength and a reduction in dispersion due to swimming activity in
strong flows. Brownian dynamics are used to cast light on the pre-asymptotic
regime, where tailed distributions are observed in agreement with recent
experiments on motile micro-organisms. Our results also highlight the subtle
effects of pillar shape, which can be used to control the magnitude of

of isolated galaxy models that have the same Toomre Q parameter and swing
amplification parameter but that differ in the vertical scale height and
velocity dispersion. We find that the onset of bar formation occurs more slowly
in models with thicker discs. Moreover, thicker discs and also discs evolved in
simulations with larger force softening also appear to be more resilient to
buckling, which acts to regulate the length and strength of bars. We also
simulate disc-halo systems in the cosmological environment using a
disc-insertion technique developed in a previous paper. In this case, bar
formation is driven by the stochastic effects of a triaxial halo and
subhalo-disc interactions and the initial growth of bars appears to be
relatively insensitive to the thickness of the disc. On the other hand, thin
discs in cosmological halos do appear to be more susceptible to buckling than
thick ones and therefore bar strength correlates with disc thickness as in the
isolated case. More to the point, one can form discs in cosmological
simulations with relatively weak bars or no bars at all provided the discs as
thin as the discs we observe and the softening length is smaller than the disc
scale height.

off resonance, the lead vector of a Jordan chain in a left eigenspace of the

order. The deviation from constancy of the action-angle variable provides a
measure of the stability of a trajectory. However, near resonance or the
stability boundary, the fluctuation increases rapidly and the lead vector no
longer represents an accurate action-angle variable. In this paper we show that
near resonance or stability boundary, it is possible to find a set of linear
combinations of the vectors in the degenerate Jordan chains as the action-angle
variables by an iteration procedure so that the fluctuation is minimized. Using
the Henon-Heiles problem as an example on resonance, we show that when compared
with conventional canonical perturbation theory, the iteration leads to result
in much more close agreement with the forward integration, and the iteration is
convergent even very close to the stability boundary. It is further shown that
the action-angle variables found in the iteration can be used to find another
action-angle variables even much more closer to rigid rotations (KAM
invariants). The fast convergent result is not in the form of polynomials, it
is an exponential function with a rational function in the exponent more
similar to a Laurent series than a Taylor series. Hence the method provides a
new way to probe the boundary of the region where KAM tori exist.

to be physically associated with the bubble,both because of the enhanced

ultraviolet radiation from embedded high-mass star(s) and from the

from exposure bias as well as the consequent error propagation problem. Many
previous works have discussed the relationship between error propagation and

often better than its right part in left-to-right decoding models) problem. In
this paper, we conduct a series of analyses to deeply understand this problem
and get several interesting findings. (1) The role of error propagation on
accuracy drop is overstated in the literature, although it indeed contributes
to the accuracy drop problem. (2) Characteristics of a language play a more
important role in causing the accuracy drop: the left part of the translation
result in a right-branching language (e.g., English) is more likely to be more
accurate than its right part, while the right part is more accurate for a
left-branching language (e.g., Japanese). Our discoveries are confirmed on

black hole candidates in our view are not black holes but will be
gravitationally contracting objects. As well known, a black hole will form by a
gravitationally collapsing object in the infinite future in the views of
distant observers like us. At the very late stage of the gravitational
collapse, the gravitationally contracting object behaves as a black body due to
its gravity. Due to this behavior, the physical signals produced around it
(e.g. the quasi-normal ringings and the shadow image) will be very similar to
those caused in the eternal black hole spacetime. However those physical
signals do not necessarily imply the formation of a black hole in the future,
since we cannot rule out the possibility that the formation of the black hole
is prevented by some unexpected event in the future yet unobserved. As such an
example, we propose a scenario in which the final state of the gravitationally
contracting spherical thin shell is a gravastar that has been proposed as a
final configuration alternative to a black hole by Mazur and Mottola. This
scenario implies that time necessary to observe the moment of the gravastar

recently. In this paper, fast time-varying channels for massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems are addressed. We derive the exact channel power
spectrum density (PSD) for the uplink from a high-speed railway (HSR) to a base
station (BS) and propose to further reduce the channel time variation via
beamforming network optimization. A large-scale uniform linear array (ULA) is
equipped at the HSR to separate multiple Doppler shifts in angle domain through
high-resolution transmit beamforming. Each branch comprises a dominant Doppler
shift, which can be compensated to suppress the channel time variation, and we
derive the channel PSD and the Doppler spread to assess the residual channel
time variation. Interestingly, the channel PSD can be exactly expressed as the
product of a pattern function and a beam-distortion function. The former
reflects the impact of array aperture and is the converted radiation pattern of
ULA, while the latter depends on the configuration of beamforming directions.
Inspired by the PSD analysis, we introduce a common configurable amplitudes and
phases (CCAP) parameter to optimize the beamforming network, by partly removing
the constant modulus quantized phase constraints of matched filter (MF)
beamformers. In this way, the residual Doppler shifts can be ulteriorly
suppressed, further reducing the residual channel time variation. The optimal
CCAP parameter minimizing the Doppler spread is derived in a closed form.
Numerical results are provided to corroborate both the channel PSD analysis and
the superiority of beamforming network optimization technique.

implemented five different techniques from the literature and conducted an
experiment using the defects4j dataset, which contains 395 real faults from six
real-world open-source Java programs. Findings indicate that running the most
dissimilar test cases early in the process is largely more effective than
random permutation (Vargha-Delaney A [VDA]: 0.76-0.99 observed using normalized
compression distance). No technique was found to be superior with respect to
the effectiveness. Locality-sensitive hashing was, to a small extent, less
effective than other SBTP techniques (VDA: 0.38 observed in comparison to
normalized compression distance), but its speed largely outperformed the other
techniques (i.e., it was approximately 5-111 times faster). Our results bring
to mind the well-known adage, ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"". To
effectively consume a limited testing budget, one should spread it evenly
across different parts of the system by running the most dissimilar test cases
early in the testing process.

for mixed states, i.e. the complex dynamical behavior is not destroyed by small
initial uncertainty. We show that the appearance of sensitive, complex dynamics
associated with a fractal structure in the parameter space of the system has
the character of a first order phase transition. The purity of the initial
state plays the role of the control parameter and the dimension of the fractal
structure is independent of the purity value after passing the phase transition
point. The critical purity coincides with the purity of a repelling fixed point
of the dynamics and we show that all the pre-images of states from the close

Initial states from this set can be considered as quasi-chaotic.

improves to a certain degree with larger history interval. DBTP can be used
effectively during the early stages, when no historical data is available, and
also combined with HBTP to improve its effectiveness. Among the investigated
techniques, we found that history-based diversity using NCD Multiset is
superior in terms of effectiveness but comes with relatively higher overhead in
terms of method execution time. Test prioritization in CI environments can be
effectively performed with negligible investment using previous failure
knowledge, and its effectiveness can be further improved by considering

observations reveal that LB2 is made up of a chain of evolving convection

the previous suggestion of central dark lanes being the top parts of convection
upflows. In contrast, the intergranular lanes are associated with redshifts and
located at two sides of each convection cell. The magnetic fields are stronger

that these intergranular lanes are manifestations of convergent convective
downflows in the light bridge. We also provide evidence that the dark knots

networks (GANs) can perfectly align independent English word embeddings induced
using the same algorithm, based on distributional information alone; but fails
to do so, for two different embeddings algorithms. Why is that? We believe
understanding why, is key to understand both modern word embedding algorithms
and the limitations and instability dynamics of GANs. This paper shows that (a)
in all these cases, where alignment fails, there exists a linear transform
between the two embeddings (so algorithm biases do not lead to non-linear
differences), and (b) similar effects can not easily be obtained by varying
hyper-parameters. One plausible suggestion based on our initial experiments is
that the differences in the inductive biases of the embedding algorithms lead
to an optimization landscape that is riddled with local optima, leading to a
very small basin of convergence, but we present this more as a challenge paper
than a technical contribution.

network when in fact they are present. Various algorithms have been proposed to
solve this problem over the past decades. For all their benefits, such
algorithms raise serious privacy concerns, as they could be used to expose a
connection between two individuals who wish to keep their relationship private.
With this in mind, we investigate the ability of such individuals to evade link
prediction algorithms. More precisely, we study their ability to strategically
alter their connections so as to increase the probability that some of their
connections remain unidentified by link prediction algorithms. We formalize
this question as an optimization problem, and prove that finding an optimal
solution is NP-complete. Despite this hardness, we show that the situation is
not bleak in practice. In particular, we propose two heuristics that can easily
be applied by members of the general public on existing social media. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of those heuristics on a wide variety of networks

relevant to many industrial applications. Rotating drums have been used
extensively as model systems to study granular media flow and mixing and
segregation. Numerous studies considered the mixing of grains with different
sizes, but only few studies considered shape and elongation, which have been
already identified as important characteristics affecting packing and inducing
segregation. In this contribution, the mixing of binary mixtures of grains
having the same volume, but different elongations was studied experimentally.
The mixing dynamics of a layered granular medium was characterized in a
rotating drum, highlighting the impact of the grain shape, of the drum angular
speed and of the drum filling ratio. A mixed or segregated state is reached
very rapidly, but experiments are continued to verify that the state reached is
a steady state. The experiments demonstrated that below a critical difference
of elongation, the grains can be mixed effectively. Conversely, when grain
elongations are very different, a central core is formed, rich in the more
elongated grains. In this case only limited mixing can be achieved. These
results can guide the formulation of mixtures of grains with different
elongations.

as graphene are some of their most important properties [1]. Good flexibility
is key for exploiting 2D materials in many emerging technologies, such as
wearable electronics, bioelectronics, protective coatings and composites [1]
and recently bending has been suggested as a route to tune electronic transport
behaviour [2]. For virtually all crystalline materials macroscopic deformation
is accommodated by the movement of dislocations and through the formation of
twinning defects [3]; it is the geometry of the resulting microstructure that
largely determines the mechanical and electronic properties. Despite this, the
atomic microstructure of 2D materials after mechanical deformation has not been
widely investigated: only by understanding these deformed microstructures can
the resulting properties be accurately predicted and controlled. In this paper
we describe the different structural features that can form as a result of
bending in van der Waals (vdW) crystals of 2D materials. We show that twin
boundaries, an important class of crystal defect, are delocalised by several nm
and not atomically sharp as has been assumed for over half a century [4]. In
addition, we demonstrate that different classes of microstructure are present
in the deformed material and can be predicted from just the atomic structure,
bend angle, and flake thickness. We anticipate that this new knowledge of the
deformation structure for 2D materials will provide foundations for tailoring
transport behaviour[2], mechanical properties, liquid-phase [5,6] and
scotch-tape exfoliation [7,8], and crystal growth.

users are charged per processed byte, collections of queries accessing the same
data frequently can become expensive. The problem is compounded by the limited
options for the user to optimize query execution when using declarative
interfaces such as SQL. In this paper, we show how, without modifying existing
systems and without the involvement of the cloud provider, it is possible to
significantly reduce the overhead, and hence the cost, of query-as-a-service
systems. Our approach is based on query rewriting so that multiple concurrent
queries are combined into a single query. Our experiments show the aggregated
amount of work done by the shared execution is smaller than in a
query-at-a-time approach. Since queries are charged per byte processed, the
cost of executing a group of queries is often the same as executing a single
one of them. As an example, we demonstrate how the shared execution of the
TPC-H benchmark is up to 100x and 16x cheaper in Amazon Athena and Google
BigQuery than using a query-at-a-time approach while achieving a higher
throughput.

particularly true for dusty galaxies in which stars experience a heavy
attenuation. The combination of UV-to-IR photometry with the spectroscopic

attenuation of the whole stellar population and its wavelength dependence. We
selected an IR complete sample of galaxies in the COSMOS 3D-HST CANDELS field
detected with the Herschel satellite with a signal to noise ratio larger than
five. Optical to NIR photometry is available as well as NIR spectroscopy for
each source. We reduced the sample to the redshift range $0.6 < z < 1.6$ to
include the H$\alpha$ line in the G141 grism spectra. We have used a new
version of the CIGALE code to fit simultaneously the continuum and H$\alpha$
line emission of the 34 selected galaxies. Using flexible attenuation laws with
free parameters, we are able to measure the shape of the attenuation curve for
each galaxy as well as the amount of attenuation of each stellar population,
the former being in general steeper than the starburst law in the UV-optical
with a large variation of the slope among galaxies. The attenuation of young
stars or nebular continuum is found on average about twice the attenuation
affecting older stars, again with a large variation. Our model with power-laws,
based on a modification of the Charlot and Fall recipe, gives results in better
agreement with the radiative transfer models than the global modification of

hyperedge - and e-adjacency - vertices of a given hyperedge are e-adjacent. In
order to build a new e-adjacency tensor that is interpretable in terms of
hypergraph uniformisation, we designed two processes: the first is a hypergraph
uniformisation process (HUP) and the second is a polynomial homogeneisation

the HUP ensures that the PHP keeps interpretability. This tensor is symmetric
and can be fully described by the number of hyperedges; its order is the range

highly sensitive to those eye conditions that obstruct the iris or cause
geometrical distortions. Second, even those conditions that do not produce
visible changes to the structure of the iris may increase the dissimilarity
between samples of the same eyes. Third, eye conditions affecting the geometry

significantly decrease same-eye similarity and have a lower, yet still

cause segmentation errors. To our knowledge this paper describes the largest

and three-dimension Weyl system (which are gapped) in the low-energy
tigh-binding model. The results, like the Fermi wavevector, Thomas-Fermi
wavevector, and longitudinal conductivity are obtained in different dimensions.
Some important conclusions are detailedly discussed in this paper, including
the screening character under short or long range Coulomb interaction, and the
longitudinal conductivity in two- or three-dimensions. The longitudinal
conductivity in optical limit is distinguishing for the case of two-dimension
system and three-dimension system. The density-dependence (including the
carrier density and the impurity concentration) of the Fermi wavevector, dc
conductivity, and the relaxation time are discussed. Specially, for the doped
Weyl system, the pumped carrier density due to the chiral anomaly origin from
electromagnetic response is controlled by the internode relaxation time which
has also been analyzed. %The model for which the calculations based on is the
low-energy tight-binding model as presented in the Sec.2, %i.e., the results in
this paper is for the low-temperature and low-energy case %and it's thus
possible to carrying out a logarithmic self-energy correction to the relaxation
time as we discussed in the text. %The difference between the longitudinal
conductivity in serversal systems is also been discussed. Our results is
helpful to the application of the Dirac or Weyl systems as well as the study on
their low-temperature characters.

methods are in relation to biometric template aging phenomenon. This is
considered to be particularly important when the time lapse between gallery and
probe samples extends significantly, to more than a few years.
  Our experiments employ iris aging analysis conducted using three different
iris recognition algorithms and a database of 583 samples from 58 irises
collected up to nine years apart. To determine the degradation rates of
similarity scores with extending time lapse and also in relation to multiple
image quality and geometrical factors of sample images, a linear regression
analysis was performed. 29 regression models have been tested with both the
time parameter and geometrical factors being statistically significant in every
model. Quality measures that showed statistically significant influence on the
predicted variable were, depending on the method, image sharpness and local
contrast or their mutual relations.
  To our best knowledge, this is the first paper describing aging analysis
using multiple regression models with data covering such a wide time period.
Results presented suggest that template aging effect occurs in iris biometrics
to a statistically significant extent. Image quality and geometrical factors
may contribute to the degradation of similarity score. However, the estimate of
time parameter showed statistical significance and similar value in each of the
tested models. This reveals that the aging phenomenon may as well be unrelated
to quality and geometrical measures of the image.

simply because they temporarily cannot see it. The main reasons for this

complexity of the game is unexpectedly increased compared with the previous
time period as more and more game objects and effects are rendered on the
display; (2) and/or the game is lagging; (3) and finally, it is also possible
that the players have no sufficient experience with controlling the character.
This paper focuses on the first reason. We have developed a benchmark program
which allows its user to experience the feeling of losing character. While the
user can control the character well the benchmark program will increase the
visual complexity of the display. Otherwise, if the user lost the character
then the program will decrease the complexity until the user will find the
character again, and so on. The complexity is measured based on the number of
changed pixels between two consecutive display images. Our measurements show
that the average of bit per second values of losing and finding pairs describes
the user well. The final goal of this research is to further develop our

best of the prior methods is the geometrical parallaxes from HST for just four

method for prior nova-distances has been the expansion parallaxes from the nova
shells, but this method is found to have real 1-sigma uncertainty of 0.95 mag
in the distance modulus, and the prior quoted error bars are on average 3.6X
worse than advertised. The many variations on the

poor to be useable, and even to be non-applicable for 5-out-of-7 samples of
nova, so the MMRD should no longer be used. The prior method of using various
measures of the extinction from the interstellar medium have been notoriously
bad, but now a new version by Ozdonmez and coworkers has improved this to an
unbiased method with 1-sigma uncertainty of 1.14 mag in the distance modulus.

of poor accuracy, and (4) if none of these methods is available, then to not

entities. Networks are usually modeled by graphs or hypergraphs; nonetheless a
given entity can occur many times in a relationship: this brings the need to
deal with multisets instead of sets or simple edges. Diffusion processes are
useful to highlight interesting parts of a network: they usually start with a
stroke at one vertex and diffuse throughout the network to reach a uniform
distribution. Several iterations of the process are required prior to reaching
a stable solution. We propose an alternative solution to highlighting the main
components of a network using a diffusion process based on exchanges: it is an
iterative two-phase step exchange process. This process allows to evaluate the
importance not only of the vertices but also of the regrouping level. To model
the diffusion process, we extend the concept of hypergraphs that are families
of sets to families of multisets, that we call hb-graphs. This version is an

also been incorporated into end-to-end learning. However, very little progress
has been made on investigating how an individual training sample will influence
the generalization ability of a model. In other words, to achieve high
generalization accuracy, do we really need all the samples in a training

convolutional neural networks may not favor all training samples, and
generalization accuracy can be further improved by dropping those unfavorable
samples. Specifically, the influence of removing a training sample is
quantifiable, and we propose a Two-Round Training approach, aiming to achieve
higher generalization accuracy. We locate unfavorable samples after the first
round of training, and then retrain the model from scratch with the reduced
training dataset in the second round. Since our approach is essentially
different from fine-tuning or further training, the computational cost should
not be a concern. Our extensive experimental results indicate that, with
identical settings, the proposed approach can boost performance of the
well-known networks on both high-level computer vision problems such as image

intensively used last years in numerical studies of Cu-Zr-(Al) bulk metallic
glasses. We consider ${\rm Cu_{64.5}Zr_{35.5}}$ and ${\rm

Exploring their structural evolution at continuous cooling and isothermal
annealing, we observe that both systems nucleate in sufficiently lengthy

higher critical nucleation time. Moreover, ${\rm Cu_{64.5}Zr_{35.5}}$ is
actually unstable to crystallization for large system sizes ($N > 20,000$).
Both systems crystallize with the formation of tetrahedrally close packed Laves
phases of different types. We reveal that structure of both systems in liquid
and glassy state contains comparable amount of polytetrahedral clusters. We
argue that nucleation instability of simulated ${\rm Cu_{64.5}Zr_{35.5}}$ alloy

motions spontaneously develop and their interaction with the main flow alters
the overall large-scale features and transfer properties. Taylor-Couette flow,
the fluid motion developing in the gap between two concentric cylinders
rotating at different angular velocity, is not an exception, and toroidal
Taylor rolls have been observed from the early development of the flow up to
the fully turbulent regime. In this manuscript we show that under the generic
name of ``Taylor rolls'' there is a wide variety of structures that differ for
the vorticity distribution within the cores, the way they are driven and their
effects on the mean flow. We relate the rolls at high Reynolds numbers not to
centrifugal instabilities, but to a combination of shear and anti-cyclonic
rotation, showing that they are preserved in the limit of vanishing curvature
and can be better understood as a pinned cycle which shows similar
characteristics as the self-sustained process of shear flows. By analyzing the
effect of the computational domain size, we show that this pinning is not a

Post-mortem human iris images were collected at the university mortuary in
three sessions separated by approximately 11 hours, with the first session
organized from 5 to 7 hours after demise. Analysis performed for four
independent iris recognition methods shows that the common claim of the iris
being useless for biometric identification soon after death is not entirely
true. Since the pupil has a constant and neutral dilation after death (the so
called ""cadaveric position""), this makes the iris pattern perfectly visible
from the standpoint of dilation. We found that more than 90% of irises are
still correctly recognized when captured a few hours after death, and that
serious iris deterioration begins approximately 22 hours later, since the
recognition rate drops to a range of 13.3-73.3% (depending on the method used)
when the cornea starts to be cloudy. There were only two failures to enroll
(out of 104 images) observed for only a single method (out of four employed in
this study). These findings show that the dynamics of post-mortem changes to
the iris that are important for biometric identification are much more moderate
than previously believed. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the
first experimental study of how iris recognition works after death, and we hope
that these preliminary findings will stimulate further research in this area.

the Medical University of Warsaw. Those images represent several common ocular
diseases, such as cataract, along with less ordinary conditions, such as iris
pattern alterations derived from illness or eye trauma. Images were captured in
near-infrared light (used in biometrics) and for selected cases also in visible
light (used in ophthalmological diagnosis). Since cataract is a disorder that
is most populated by samples in the database, in this paper we focus solely on
this illness. To assess the extent of the performance deterioration we use
three iris recognition methodologies (commercial and academic solutions) to
calculate genuine match scores for healthy eyes and those influenced by
cataract. Results show a significant degradation in iris recognition
reliability manifesting by worsening the genuine scores in all three matchers
used in this study (12% of genuine score increase for an academic matcher, up
to 175% of genuine score increase obtained for an example commercial matcher).
This increase in genuine scores affected the final false non-match rate in two
matchers. To our best knowledge this is the only study of such kind that
employs more than one iris matcher, and analyzes the iris image segmentation as
a potential source of decreased reliability.

recognition has been shown to work with horse irides, provided that algorithms
deployed for such task are fine-tuned for horse irides and input data is of

  First, we manage to show that after simple preprocessing, such images offer

grids that adapt to the evolving interfaces and track regions of high
vorticity. The algorithm combines the interface capturing level set method with
a variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes solver that is demonstrated
to stably resolve material contrast ratios of up to six orders of magnitude.
The discretization approach ensures second-order pointwise accuracy for both
velocity and pressure with several physical boundary treatments, including
velocity and traction boundary conditions. The paper includes several test
cases that demonstrate the order of accuracy and algorithmic scalability of the
flow solver. To ensure the stability of the numerical scheme in the presence of
high density and viscosity ratios, we employ a consistent treatment of mass and
momentum transport in the conservative form of discrete equations. This
consistency is achieved by solving an additional mass balance equation, which
we approximate via a strong stability preserving Runga-Kutta time integrator
and by employing the same mass flux (obtained from the mass equation) in the
discrete momentum equation. The scheme uses higher-order total variation
diminishing (TVD) and convection-boundedness criterion (CBC) satisfying limiter
to avoid numerical fluctuations in the transported density field. The
high-order bounded convective transport is done on a dimension-by-dimension
basis, which makes the scheme simple to implement. We also demonstrate through
several test cases that the lack of consistent mass and momentum transport in
non-conservative formulations, which are commonly used in practice, or the use
of non-CBC satisfying limiters can yield very large numerical error and very
poor accuracy for convection-dominant high density ratio flows.

together with manual post-processing to remove vegetation on the slope. After
that, the mountain slope's digital terrain model (DTM) is generated for each

C 78(2018)721","10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6201-6",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the propagation of axial gravitational waves in
the background of the flat FRW universe in $f(R,T)$ theory. The field equations
are obtained for unperturbed as well as axially perturbed FRW metric. These
field equations are solved simultaneously to obtain the unknown perturbation
parameters. We find that the assumed perturbations can affect matter as well as
four-velocity. Moreover, ignoring the material perturbations we explicitly
obtain an expression for four-velocity. It is concluded that axial
gravitational waves in the curvature-matter coupling background can produce
cosmological rotation or have memory effect if the wave profile has a
discontinuity at the wavefront.

collisions in Minkowski space, applying the kinematic constraints that arise
from the relevant generalization of the Nambu-Goto action. In particular, we
revisit the solution for chiral superconducting cosmic strings and demonstrate
that Y junction production for such strings is possible. We consider the
collision of chiral current-carrying straight strings and obtain the region in
angle-velocity space that allows the production of string junctions. This study
contributes to the understanding of the complex evolution of chiral
superconducting string networks.

  Names from Usage Contexts",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LG cs.PL stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the JavaScript code deployed in the wild has been minified, a process
in which identifier names are replaced with short, arbitrary and meaningless
names. Minified code occupies less space, but also makes the code extremely
difficult to manually inspect and understand. This paper presents Context2Name,
a deep learningbased technique that partially reverses the effect of
minification by predicting natural identifier names for minified names. The
core idea is to predict from the usage context of a variable a name that
captures the meaning of the variable. The approach combines a lightweight,
token-based static analysis with an auto-encoder neural network that summarizes
usage contexts and a recurrent neural network that predict natural names for a
given usage context. We evaluate Context2Name with a large corpus of real-world
JavaScript code and show that it successfully predicts 47.5% of all minified
identifiers while taking only 2.9 milliseconds on average to predict a name. A
comparison with the state-of-the-art tools JSNice and JSNaughty shows that our
approach performs comparably in terms of accuracy while improving in terms of
efficiency. Moreover, Context2Name complements the state-of-the-art by
predicting 5.3% additional identifiers that are missed by both existing tools.

  We obtain some algebraic properties of these polynomials such as an explicit
representation, a five-term recurrence relation as well as a second order
linear $q$-difference holonomic equation fulfilled by such polynomials.
  We present an analysis of the behaviour of its zeros function of the mass

(respectively, the greatest) zero of the studied polynomials is located outside
of the support of the measure.
  We conclude this work considering two examples.
