marginal conditional quantiles of multivariate response variables in a linear
regression framework.
  We consider a slight reparameterization of the Multivariate Asymmetric
Laplace distribution proposed by Kotz et al (2001) and exploit its
location-scale mixture representation to implement a new EM algorithm for
estimating model parameters. The idea is to extend the link between the
Asymmetric Laplace distribution and the well-known univariate quantile
regression model to a multivariate context, i.e. when a multivariate dependent
variable is concerned. The approach accounts for association among multiple
responses and study how the relationship between responses and explanatory
variables can vary across different quantiles of the marginal conditional
distribution of the responses. A penalized version of the EM algorithm is also
presented to tackle the problem of variable selection. The validity of our
approach is analyzed in a simulation study, where we also provide evidence on
the efficiency gain of the proposed method compared to estimation obtained by
separate univariate quantile regressions. A real data application is finally
proposed to study the main determinants of financial distress in a sample of
Italian firms.

propose a Photonic Spiking Neural Network computing primitive, comprising of a
non-volatile synaptic array integrated seamlessly with previously explored

computing platform that leverages the inherent parallelism of
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM). We show that the proposed computing
platform can be used to emulate a SNN inferencing engine for image

paves the way for ultra-fast computing and localized on-chip learning.

etc.. ) on the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold is a central topic in
Riemannian geometry. Generalized Cheeger-Gromoll metrics is a family of natural
metrics $h_{p,q}$ depending on two parameters with $p\in\mathbb{R}$ and
$q\geq0$. This family has been introduced recently and possesses interesting
geometric properties. If $p=q=0$ we recover the Sasaki metric and when $p=q=1$
we recover the classical Cheeger-Gromoll metric. A transitive Euclidean Lie
algebroid is a transitive Lie algebroid with an Euclidean product on its total
space.
  In this paper, we show that natural metrics can be built in a natural way on
the total space of transitive Euclidean Lie algebroids. Then we study the
properties of generalized Cheeger-Gromoll metrics on this new context. We show
a rigidity result of this metrics which generalizes so far all rigidity results
known in the case of the tangent bundle. We show also that considering natural
metrics on the total space of transitive Euclidean Lie algebroids opens new
interesting horizons.
  For instance, Atiyah Lie algebroids constitute an important class of
transitive Lie algebroids and we will show that natural metrics on the total
space of Atiyah Euclidean Lie algebroids have interesting properties. In
particular, if $M$ is a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, then the Atiyah
Lie algebroid associated to the $\mathrm{O}(n)$-principal bundle of orthonormal
frames over $M$ possesses a family depending on a parameter $k>0$ of transitive
Euclidean Lie algebroids structures say $AO(M,k)$. When $M$ is a space form of
constant curvature $c$, we show that there exists two constants $C_n<0$ and
$K(n,c)>0$ such that $(AO(M,k),h_{1,1})$ is a Riemannian manifold with positive
scalar curvature if and only if $c>C_n$ and $0<k\leq K(n,c)$.

contain an immersed microstructure such as polymer molecules, or filaments. In
many important biological processes, such as mammalian reproduction and

that of the swimming cells. This leads to discrete swimmer-microstructure
interactions that alter the swimmer's path and speed. In this paper, we use a
combination of detailed simulation and data-driven stochastic models to examine
the motion of a planar undulatory swimmer in an environment of spherical
obstacles tethered via linear springs to random points in the plane of
locomotion. We find that depending on environmental parameters, the
interactions with the obstacles can both enhance swimming speeds, as well as
prevent the swimmer from moving at all. We also show how the discrete
interactions produce translational and angular velocity fluctuations that over
time lead to diffusive behaviour primarily due to the coupling of swimming and
rotational diffusion. Our results demonstrate that direct
swimmer-microstructure interactions can produce changes in swimmer motion that
may have important implications to the spreading of cell populations in, or the

fog. Although considerable progress has been made in semantic scene
understanding, it is mainly related to clear-weather scenes. Extending
recognition methods to adverse weather conditions such as fog is crucial for
outdoor applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named
Curriculum Model Adaptation (CMAda), which gradually adapts a semantic
segmentation model from light synthetic fog to dense real fog in multiple
steps, using both synthetic and real foggy data. In addition, we present three
other main stand-alone contributions: 1) a novel method to add synthetic fog to
real, clear-weather scenes using semantic input; 2) a new fog density
estimator; 3) the Foggy Zurich dataset comprising $3808$ real foggy images,
with pixel-level semantic annotations for $16$ images with dense fog. Our
experiments show that 1) our fog simulation slightly outperforms a
state-of-the-art competing simulation with respect to the task of semantic
foggy scene understanding (SFSU); 2) CMAda improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models for SFSU significantly by leveraging unlabeled real
foggy data. The datasets and code are publicly available.

a new dual for quadratic programs, in which, the dual variables are affine
functions, and we prove strong duality. Since the new dual is intractable, we
consider a modified version by restricting the feasible set. This leads to a
new bound for quadratic programs. We demonstrate that the dual of the bound is
a semi-definite relaxation of quadratic programs. In addition, we probe the
relationship between this bound and the well-known bounds. In the second part,
thanks to the new bound, we propose a branch and cut algorithm for concave
quadratic programs. We establish that the algorithm enjoys global convergence.
The effectiveness of the method is illustrated for numerical problem instances.

spin-reorientation (SR) transition $T_{\mathrm{SR}}=7.6$ K, in magnetic fields
applied along the $a, b$ and $c$ axes. Using single-crystal inelastic neutron
scattering, we observed that the spectrum of magnetic excitations consists of
two collective modes well separated in energy: 3D gapped magnons with a
bandwidth of $\sim$60 meV, associated with the antiferromagnetically (AFM)
ordered Fe subsystem, and quasi-1D AFM fluctuations of $\sim$1 meV within the
Yb subsystem, with no hybridization of those modes. The spin dynamics of the Fe
subsystem changes very little through the SR transition and could be well
described in the frame of semiclassical linear spin-wave theory. On the other
hand, the rotation of the net moment of the Fe subsystem at $T_{\mathrm{SR}}$
drastically changes the excitation spectrum of the Yb subsystem, inducing the
transition between two regimes with magnon and spinon-like fluctuations. At $T
< T_{\mathrm{SR}}$, the Yb spin chains have a well defined field-induced
ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, and the spectrum consists of a sharp
single-magnon mode, a two-magnon bound state, and a two-magnon continuum,
whereas at $T > T_{\mathrm{SR}}$ only a gapped broad spinon-like continuum
dominates the spectrum. In this work we show that a weak quasi-1D coupling
within the Yb subsystem $J_\text{Yb-Yb}$, mainly neglected in previous studies,
creates unusual quantum spin dynamics on the low energy scales. The results of
our work may stimulate further experimental search for similar compounds with
several magnetic subsystems and energy scales, where low-energy fluctuations

this says little about how close it is to the unknown solution. We consider the
use of relaxations to the ground-state problem as a benchmark for the output of
quantum optimisers. These relaxations are radically more informative because
they provide lower bounds to the ground-state energy. The chordal branch and

of the problems that are currently addressed by heuristic optimisation
algorithms more efficiently and for larger system sizes. We apply the method to
verify the output of a D-Wave 2000Q device and identify instances where the
annealer does not reach the ground-state energy and, more importantly,

p/d/3He+A at RHIC and the LHC reveal particle emission patterns that are
strikingly similar to those observed in A+A collisions. One explanation of
these patterns is the formation of small droplets of quark-gluon plasma
followed by hydrodynamic evolution. A geometry engineering program was proposed
[1] to investigate these emission patterns, and the experimental data from that
program in p+Au, d+Au, 3He+Au collisions for elliptic and triangular anisotropy
coefficients v2 and v3 follow the pattern predicted by hydrodynamic
calculations [2]. One alternative approach, referred to as initial-state
correlations, suggests that for small systems the patterns observed in the
final-state hadrons are encoded at the earliest moments of the collision, and
therefore require no final-state parton scattering or hydrodynamic evolution
[3,4]. Recently, new calculations using only initial-state correlations, in the
dilute-dense approximation of gluon saturation physics, reported striking
agreement with the v2 patterns observed in p/d/3He+Au data at RHIC [5]. The
reported results are counterintuitive and thus we aim here to reproduce some of
the basic features of these calculations. In this first investigation, we
provide a description of our model, IP-Jazma, and investigate its implications
for saturation scales, multiplicity distributions and eccentricities, reserving
for later work the analysis of momentum spectra and azimuthal anisotropies. We
find that our implementation of the saturation physics model reproduces the
results of the earlier calculation of the multiplicity distribution in d+Au
collisions at RHIC. However, our investigations, together with existing data,
call into question some of the essential elements reported in Ref. [5].

i.a.\ Bernoulli percolation, random interlacements and level sets of the
Gaussian free field, large scale geometry of the unique infinite cluster in
strongly percolative regime is qualitatively the same; in particular, the
random walk on the infinite cluster satisfies the quenched invariance
principle, Gaussian heat-kernel bounds and local CLT.
  In this paper we consider the random walk loop soup on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in
dimensions $d\geq 3$. An interesting aspect of this model is that despite its
similarity and connections to random interlacements and the Gaussian free
field, it does not fall into the above mentioned general class of percolation
models, since the required decoupling inequalities are not valid.
  We identify weaker (and more natural) decoupling inequalities and prove that
(a) they do hold for the random walk loop soup and (b) all the results about
the large scale geometry of the infinite percolation cluster proved for the
above mentioned class of models hold also for models that satisfy the weaker
decoupling inequalities. Particularly, all these results are new for the vacant
set of the random walk loop soup. (The range of the random walk loop soup has
been addressed by Chang arXiv:1504.07906 by a model specific approximation
method, which does not apply to the vacant set.)
  Finally, we prove that the strongly supercritical regime for the vacant set
of the random walk loop soup is non-trivial. It is expected, but open at the
moment, that the strongly supercritical regime coincides with the whole
supercritical regime.

smoothness, and apply them to $\ell_\infty$ regression over a box to give
algorithms which converge in $k$ iterations at a $O(1/k)$ rate. Our algorithms
can be viewed as an alternative approach to the recent breakthrough result of
Sherman [She17] which achieves a similar runtime improvement over classic
algorithmic approaches, i.e. smoothing and gradient descent, which either
converge at a $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ rate or have running times with a worse
dependence on problem parameters. Our runtimes match those of [She17] across a
broad range of parameters and achieve improvement in certain structured cases.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our result by providing faster algorithms for
the well-studied maximum flow problem. Directly leveraging our accelerated

flow for an undirected graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices, generically
improving upon the previous best known runtime of
$\tilde{O}\left(m/\epsilon\right)$ in [She17] whenever the graph is slightly
dense. We further design an algorithm adapted to the structure of the
regression problem induced by maximum flow obtaining a runtime of
$\tilde{O}\left(m + \max(n, \sqrt{ns})/\epsilon\right)$, where $s$ is the
squared $\ell_2$ norm of the congestion of any optimal flow. Moreover, we show
how to leverage this result to achieve improved exact algorithms for maximum
flow on a variety of unit capacity graphs. We hope that our work serves as an
important step towards achieving even faster maximum flow algorithms.

impair performance of core behaviors. Their neural circuits need to maintain
function despite injury, which in particular requires preserving key system
outputs. In this work, we explore whether and how certain structural and
functional neuronal network motifs act as injury mitigation mechanisms.
Specifically, we examine how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise,
and (iii) parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to the
robustness of the olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth. We simulate
injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory network
calibrated to in vivo data. The injuries are modeled on focal axonal swellings,
a ubiquitous form of axonal pathology observed in traumatic brain injuries and
other brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon, reducing the effective neural firing rate delivered
to downstream neurons. All three of the network motifs examined significantly
mitigate the effects of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's
impact on readout neuron responses or by restoring these responses to
pre-injury levels. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their value
as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural injury.
More generally, robustness to injury is a vital design principle to consider
when analyzing neural systems.

morphologies. While molecular line measurements often show broad cores,
submillimeter continuum observations predominantly display pinched cores
compared to the bulk of the filament gas. In order to explain how different
morphologies arise, we use the gravitational instability model where prestellar
cores form by growing density perturbations. The radial extent at each position
is set by the local line-mass. We show that the ratio of core radius to
filament radius is determined by the initial line-mass of the filament.
Additionally, the core morphology is independent of perturbation length scale
and inclination, which makes it an ideal diagnostic for observations. Filaments
with a line-mass of less than half its critical value should form broad cores,
whereas filaments with more than half its critical line-mass value should form
pinched cores. For filaments embedded in a constant background pressure, the
dominant perturbation growth times significantly differ for low and high
line-mass filaments. Therefore, we predict that only one population of cores is
present if all filaments within a region begin with similar initial
perturbations.

in terms of the field's radiative degrees of freedom. Its expression also
involves Coulombic pieces of the field, in the form of a charge aspect
$q(\theta,\phi)$, a function of polar angles whose integral gives the total
charge of the system. Guided by the strong analogy between radiative processes
in electromagnetism and gravitation, we ask whether the flux of angular
momentum in general relativity might also involve Coulombic pieces of the
gravitational field. Further, we ask whether such terms might have been missed
in the past by specializing the flux to sources of gravitational waves that are
at rest with respect to the frame in which the flux is evaluated. To answer
these questions we bring together the Landau-Lifshitz formulation of the
Einstein field equations, which provides specific definitions for angular
momentum and its associated flux, and the Bondi formalism, which provides a
systematic expansion of the metric of an asymptotically flat spacetime in
inverse powers of the distance away from the matter distribution. We obtain a
new expression for the flux of angular momentum, which is not restricted to
sources of gravitational waves at rest nor to periodic sources. We show that
our new expression is equivalent to the standard formula used in the literature
when these restrictions are put in place. We find that contrary to expectations
based on the analogy between electromagnetism and gravitation, the flux of
angular momentum in general relativity can be expressed entirely in terms of
the field's radiative degrees of freedom. In contrast to electromagnetism, no

due principally to the presence of large QCD multijet backgrounds at this
energy, rendering the searches at the LHC particularly difficult. Recently, it
was realized that these large backgrounds could be overcome by demanding one
high-$p_T$ jet from initial-state radiation (ISR) and by means of novel
jet-reconstruction techniques through which the resulting hadronized products
of the massive resonances are reconstructed as a fat-jet, a unique large-radius

Models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking with an spontaneously broken

the R-axion, which naturally tends to be light. In the parameter space regions
where the anomalous R-axion coupling to gluons is boosted, these models can be
tested against these new LHC dijet searches. Taking into account the CMS

calibrations, we use theoretical models of Miras to determine the dependence of
the period-luminosity relation on age, metallicity, and helium abundance, under
the assumption that Miras trace the bulk stellar population. We find that at a

model by choosing the cubed scale factor as the discretized configurational
variable, while the anisotropies remain pure Einsteinian variables. Such a
modified theory of gravity should be regarded as the appropriate framework to
describe the behavior of quantum mean values, both in polymer quantum mechanics
and in Loop Quantum Cosmology. We first construct the generalized Kasner
solution, including a massless scalar field and a cosmological constant in the
dynamics. They account for a quasi-isotropization, inflationary-like mechanism.
The resulting scenario links a singularity-free Kasner-like regime with a
homogeneous and isotropic de Sitter phase. Subsequently, we investigate the
role of the three-dimensional scalar curvature, demonstrating that a bounce of
the point-universe against the potential walls can always occur within the
polymer framework, also in the presence of a scalar field. However, the absence
of the singularity implies that the curvature is bounded. Therefore, the
point-universe undergoes an oscillatory regime until it oversteps the potential
walls (if the Big Bounce is not reached before). After that, a final stable
Kasner-like regime will last all the way toward the Big Bounce. Thus, the
present study demonstrates that, as soon as a discretization of the volume of
the universe is performed, the generic cosmological solution is non-chaotic and
free from singularities. It is likely that the same result can be achieved also
in the loop quantum cosmology approach.

photon index, at rest-frame energies $>2$ keV, in each source with relatively
high accuracy. These measurements allowed us to confirm previous reports that
WLQs have steeper X-ray spectra, suggesting higher accretion rates with respect
to 'typical' quasars. A comparison between the photon indices of our
radio-quiet WLQs and those of a control sample of 85 sources shows that the
first are significantly higher, at the >~$3\sigma$ level. Collectively, the
four radio-intermediate WLQs have lower photon indices with respect to the six
radio-quiet WLQs, as may be expected if the spectra of the first group are
contaminated by X-ray emission from a jet. Therefore, in the absence of
significant jet emission along our line of sight, these results are in
agreement with the idea that WLQs constitute the extreme high end of the
accretion rate distribution in quasars. We detect soft excess emission in our
lowest-redshift radio-quiet WLQ, in agreement with previous findings suggesting
that the prominence of this feature is associated with a high accretion rate.
We have not detected signatures of Compton reflection, Fe K$\alpha$ lines, or
strong variability between two X-ray epochs in any of our WLQs, which can be
attributed to their relatively high luminosity.

Basics of the hybrid scheme are reviewed, and heuristics provided to show a

CUDA runtime library to handle memory management, and on the cuFFT library for
computing local FFTs. The manner in which the interfaces are constructed to
these libraries, and ISO bindings utilized to facilitate platform portability,
are discussed. CUDA streams are implemented to overlap data transfer with cuFFT
computation. Testing with a baseline solver demonstrates significant aggregate
speed-up over the hybrid MPI-OpenMP solver by offloading to GPUs on an
NVLink-based test system. While the batch streamed approach provides little
benefit with NVLink, we see a performance gain of 30% when tuned for the
optimal number of streams on a PCIe-based system. It is found that strong GPU
scaling is ideal, or slightly better than ideal, in all cases. In addition to
speed-up measurements for the fiducial solver, we also consider several other

therefore long exponentially-decaying intrinsic valley relaxation. Moreover,
the valley noise signals are shown to validate both the relaxation times and
the spectral dependence of conventional (perturbative) pump-probe measurements.

gauge groups given by products of $U(n)$, $SU(n)$ and $Sp(n)$ factors, as well
as for $E_8$. For other gauge groups, anomaly cancellation is equivalent to the
triviality of a certain 7-dimensional spin topological field theory. We show in
the case of a finite Abelian gauge group that there are residual global
anomalies imposing constraints on the 6d supergravity. These constraints are
compatible with the known F-theory models. Interestingly, our construction
requires that the gravitational anomaly coefficient of the 6d supergravity
theory is a characteristic element of the lattice of string charges, a fact
true in six-dimensional F-theory compactifications but that until now was
lacking a low-energy explanation. We also discover a new anomaly coefficient
associated with a torsion characteristic class in theories with a disconnected
gauge group.

Our approach leverages macro-scale 3D structural geometry - the relative
configuration of arbitrary surfaces and relationships among structures that are
potentially far apart. We express such discriminative information in a
viewpoint-invariant feature space. These are subsequently encoded in a
frame-level signature that can be utilized to measure geometric similarity.
Such a characterization is robust to noise, incomplete and partially
overlapping data besides viewpoint changes. We show how it can be employed to
select a diverse set of data frames which have structurally similar content,
and how to validate whether views with similar geometric content are from the
same scene. The problem is formulated as one of general purpose retrieval from
an unannotated, spatio-temporally unordered database. Empirical analysis
indicates that the presented approach thoroughly outperforms baselines on depth
/ range data. Its depth-only performance is competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches with RGB or RGB-D inputs, including ones based on deep learning.
Experiments show retrieval performance to hold up well with much sparser
databases, which is indicative of the approach's robustness. The approach
generalized well - it did not require dataset specific training, and scaled up
in our experiments. Finally, we also demonstrate how geometrically diverse
selection of views can result in richer 3D reconstructions.

maximum likelihood approaches to solve the task. In particular, we exploit the

approaches, although paradoxically characterized in many cases by a lower

expressive nonlinear data-supporting manifold. The dynamics on this manifold
are then modeled by the modified LSTM network in a computationally efficient
manner. An offline unsupervised training strategy that exploits the model
modularity is also developed. We demonstrate our model on three illustrative

practical threats to modern computing systems. Recent attacks have all
exploited the underlying shared hardware. While practical, mounting such a
complicated attack is still akin to listening on a private conversation in a
crowded train station. The attacker has to either perform significant manual
labor or use AI systems to automate the process. The recent academic literature
points to the latter option. With the abundance of cheap computing power and
the improvements made in AI, it is quite advantageous to automate such tasks.
By using AI systems however, malicious parties also inherit their weaknesses.
One such weakness is undoubtedly the vulnerability to adversarial samples.
  In contrast to the previous literature, for the first time, we propose the
use of adversarial learning as a defensive tool to obfuscate and mask private
information. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by first training
CNNs and other machine learning classifiers on leakage trace of different
processes. After training highly accurate models (99+% accuracy), we
investigate their resolve against adversarial learning methods. By applying
minimal perturbations to input traces, the adversarial traffic by the defender
can run as an attachment to the original process and cloak it against a
malicious classifier.
  Finally, we investigate whether an attacker can protect her classifier model
by employing adversarial defense methods, namely adversarial re-training and
defensive distillation. Our results show that even in the presence of an
intelligent adversary that employs such techniques, all 10 of the tested
adversarial learning methods still manage to successfully craft adversarial
perturbations and the proposed cloaking methodology succeeds.

topology, (b) massive amounts of labeled training data, and (c) extensive
training over large-scale compute resources to build a system that can perform
efficient image classification or speech recognition. Unfortunately, we are
still far away from implementing adaptive general purpose intelligent systems
which would need to learn autonomously in unknown environments and may not have
access to some or any of these three components. Reinforcement learning and
evolutionary algorithm (EA) based methods circumvent this problem by
continuously interacting with the environment and updating the models based on
obtained rewards. However, deploying these algorithms on ubiquitous autonomous
agents at the edge (robots/drones) demands extremely high energy-efficiency due
to (i) tight power and energy budgets, (ii) continuous/lifelong interaction
with the environment, (iii) intermittent or no connectivity to the cloud to run
heavy-weight processing. To address this need, we present GENESYS, an HW-SW
prototype of an EA-based learning system, that comprises a closed loop learning
engine called EvE and an inference engine called ADAM. EvE can evolve the
topology and weights of neural networks completely in hardware for the task at
hand, without requiring hand-optimization or backpropagation training. ADAM
continuously interacts with the environment and is optimized for efficiently
running the irregular neural networks generated by EvE. GENESYS identifies and
leverages multiple unique avenues of parallelism unique to EAs that we term
'gene'- level parallelism, and 'population'-level parallelism. We ran GENESYS
with a suite of environments from OpenAI gym and observed 2-5 orders of
magnitude higher energy-efficiency over state-of-the-art embedded and desktop

nonmagnetic ground state and the Fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures. As
pressure is increased, the power law exponent in resistivity, $n$, deviates
significantly from Fermi liquid behavior and tends to saturate with $n$ = 1
near $p_c$. A pronounced resistivity maximum, $T_\text{max}$, which scales with
Kondo temperature is observed. $T_\text{max}$ decreases with increasing
pressure and flattened out near $p_c$ indicating the suppression of Kondo
exchange interaction. For $p>p_c$, $T_\text{max}$ shows a sudden upward shift,
most likely becoming associated with crystal electric field scattering.
Application of magnetic field for $p>p_c$ broadens the transition and shifts it
toward the higher temperature, which is a typical behavior of the ferromagnetic
transition. The magnetic transition appears to abruptly develop above $p_c$,
suggesting probable first-order (with changing pressure) nature of the
transition; once stabilized, the ordering temperature does not depend on
pressure up to $\sim$ 26 GPa. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that
YbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ has a quantum phase transition at $p_c$ = 18.2 GPa associated

spatially varying ``mass'' term. It is well-known that when the mass function
has the form of a kink, or \emph{domain wall}, transitioning between strictly
positive and strictly negative asymptotic mass, $\pm\kappa_\infty$, at
$\pm\infty$, the Dirac operator has a simple eigenvalue of zero energy
(geometric multiplicity equal to one) within a gap in the continuous spectrum,
with corresponding \emph{zero mode}, an exponentially localized eigenfunction.
We prove that when the mass function has the form of \emph{two} domain walls
separated by a sufficiently large distance $2 \delta$, the Dirac operator has
two real simple eigenvalues of opposite sign and of order $e^{- 2
|\kappa_\infty| \delta}$. The associated eigenfunctions are, up to $L^2$ error

we outline their natural extension to the case of $n$ domain walls for which
the minimal distance between domain walls is sufficiently large.
  The class of Dirac operators we consider controls the bifurcation of
topologically protected ``edge states'' from Dirac points (linear band
crossings) for classes of Schr\""odinger operators with domain-wall modulated
periodic potentials in one and two space dimensions. The present results may be
used to construct a rich class of defect modes in periodic structures modulated

of the gas and stars in orbit around the Galactic Centre is equal to the
angular speed of the spiral arm pattern) has often been predicted (at various
places), but not measured with a high precision.
  Here we test the locations of masers with respect to the Perseus arm (Table
1). Our analysis of the masers and HII regions near the Perseus arm (mostly
located on the inner arm side, by about 0.4 kpc from the cold CO mid-arm) shows
that the co-rotation Rcoro must be > 10.8 kpc from the Galactic Center (Figure
1). This implies that the angular rotation speed of the spiral pattern < 21.3
km/s/kpc.
  Another test in galactic quadrant II shows that the radial velocity of the
masers are generally more negative than that of the CO mid-arm (Figure 2),
indicating a deceleration with respect to the CO mid-arm, by about 9 km/s. This
implies that a spiral pattern angular rotation < 20.7 km/s/kpc, and thus Rcoro
> 11.1 kpc.
  Finally, comparing our results with other published results (Table 2), we
find a statistical mean co-rotation radius Rcoro predicted to be near 12 kpc
from the Galactic Center (beyond the Perseus arm; before the Cygnus arm), and a
mean angular spiral pattern angular rotation predicted to be near 19 km/s/kpc.

differentially private protocols in a distributed setting, where each user
holds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered two models: the
""central"" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear,
which allows greater accuracy; and the ""local"" model, in which users
individually randomize their data, and need not trust the server, but accuracy
is limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central model without a
trusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which
limits scalability.
  In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for
distributed differentially private algorithms, which lies between the local and
central models. This simple-to-implement model, a special case of the ESA
framework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an anonymous
channel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum
queries, we show that this model provides the power of the central model while
avoiding the need to trust a central server and the complexity of cryptographic
secure function evaluation. More generally, we give evidence that the power of
the shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local models:
for a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a
widely studied selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity
than do central-model protocols.

coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we show that, with increasing
cationic side-chain length, some local pieces of non-polar domains are
gradually formed by side chains aligned in parallel inside the NSL phase,
before an abrupt percolation phase transition happens when the system

Percolation phase transition is applied to ILs, providing new insights into

parameters -- equatorial radius $R_{\rm eq}$, equatorial velocity $V_{\rm eq}$,
inclination $i$, rotation-axis position angle $PA_{\rm rot}$, and flattening --
with an estimation of gravity-darkening coefficient $\beta$ using previously
published theoretical results. We use the Simulation Code of
Interferometric-observations for ROtators and CirCumstellar Objects (SCIROCCO),
a semi-analytical algorithm dedicated to fast rotators. We chose Regulus
because it is a very well-known edge-on star, for which an alternative approach
is needed to check the previously published results. Our analysis showed that a
significant degeneracy of solution is present. By confronting the results
obtained by differential interferometry with those obtained by conventional
long-base interferometry, we obtain similar results (within the uncertainties),
thereby validating our approach, where $V_{eq}$ and $i$ are found separately.
From the photocentre displacement, we can independently deduce $PA_{rot}$. We
use two minimization methods to restrict observed stellar parameters via a fast
rotator model: a non-stochastic method ($\chi^2$ fit) and a stochastic one
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo method), in order to check whether the correct global
minimum is achieved particularly with respect to the degeneracies of the
gravity darkening parameter $\beta$, where we demonstrate, using a quantitative
analysis of parameters, that the estimate of $\beta$ is easier for stars with
an inclination angle of around $45^\circ$.

constraint, constant mean curvatures (CMC) surfaces are idealizations of
interfaces occurring between two immiscible fluids. Their behavior elucidates
phenomena seen in many microscale systems of applied science and engineering;
however, explicitly computing the shapes of CMC surfaces is often impossible,
especially when the boundary of the interface is fixed and parameters, such as
the volume enclosed by the surface, vary. In this work, we propose a novel
method for computing discrete versions of CMC surfaces based on solving a
quasilinear, elliptic partial differential equation that is derived from
writing the unknown surface as a normal graph over another known CMC surface.
The partial differential equation is then solved using an arc-length
continuation algorithm, and the resulting algorithm produces a continuous
family of CMC surfaces for varying volume whose physical stability is known. In
addition to providing details of the algorithm, various test examples are
presented to highlight the efficacy, accuracy and robustness of the proposed
approach.

level of the reflecting layer was constrained to be at 570+/-30 mbar based on
fitting strong ammonia lines at 5.32 microns. We identify this layer as an

found evidence for a strongly absorbing, but not totally opaque, cloud layer at
pressures deeper than 1.3 bar by combining Cassini/CIRS spectra of the GRS at
7.18 microns with ground-based spectra at 5 microns. This is consistent with
the predicted level of an NH4SH cloud. We also constrained the vertical profile
of water and ammonia. The GRS spectrum is matched by a saturated water profile
above an opaque water cloud at 5~bars. The pressure of the water cloud
constrains Jupiter's O/H ratio to be at least 1.1 times solar. The ammonia mole

the performance of candidate models following limited training to automatically

efficiency be achieved by guiding the search via measurements of a high
performing network with unknown detailed architecture (e.g. the primate visual
system)? As one step toward this goal, we use representational similarity
analysis to evaluate the similarity of internal activations of candidate
networks with those of a (fixed, high performing) teacher network. We show that
adopting this evaluation metric could produce up to an order of magnitude in
search efficiency over performance-guided methods. Our approach finds a
convolutional cell structure with similar performance as was previously found
using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of
magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times
lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS). We further show that
measurements from only ~300 neurons from primate visual system provides enough
signal to find a network with an Imagenet top-1 error that is significantly
lower than that achieved by performance-guided architecture search alone. These
results suggest that representational matching can be used to accelerate

semi-leptonic decays of $B$-mesons, such as the excess in the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$
measurements. These anomalies seem to suggest intriguing hints of lepton flavor
non-universality, and the R-parity violating (RPV) interactions are candidates
for explaining this non-universality. In this paper, we discuss the RPV
interactions for resolving the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly with the Grand Unified
Theory (GUT) assumption. To solve the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly, it is known
that large RPV couplings and around $1~{\rm TeV}$ sfermion masses are required.
At the same time, large RPV couplings are conducive to realize the bottom-tau
Yukawa unification which appears in the GUT models. On the other hand, there
are problems for realizing favorable sfermion masses in the constrained minimal
supersymetric standard model. To resolve these problems, we show that two
non-universalities, the non-universal sfermion masses and the non-universal
gaugino masses, are favorable.

the Dufour effect, both the concentration and temperature variations are

  We have used this method to align images of different modalities such as RGB

support is small compared to the wavelength and scattering intensity. Next, we
localize and geometrize the ""smallness"" results to the case where there is a

game with a single leader and multiple followers who, after observing the
leader's commitment, play a Nash equilibrium. The corresponding search problem,
both in the optimistic and pessimistic versions, is known to be not in
Poly-$\textsf{APX}$ unless $\textsf{P}=\textsf{NP}$ and exact algorithms are

ingredients in the Paris-Durham code. For the first time, we examine the
time-dependent conversion of atomic to molecular hydrogen along the wind
trajectories of ""hot"" and ""cold"" AGB stars. We suggest that the low abundance
of HI inferred from observations is due to hydrogen locked in its molecular
form. Then, we try to reproduce HI 21-cm line profile in a ""hot"" AGB (called Y

in practice, we organized a series of circle antipode experiments. In the
experiments, pedestrians are uniformly initialized on the circle and required
to leave for their antipodal positions simultaneously. On the one hand, a
conflicting area is naturally formulated in the central region due to the
converged shortest routes, so the practical conflict avoidance behaviors can be
fully explored. On the other hand, the symmetric experimental conditions of
pedestrians, e.g., symmetric starting points, symmetric destination points, and
symmetric surroundings lay the foundation for further quantitative comparisons
among participants. The pedestrian trajectories in the experiments are
recognized and rotated, and several aspects, e.g., the trajectory space
distribution, route length, travel time, velocity distribution, and
time-series, are investigated. It is found that: (1) Pedestrians prefer the
right-hand side during the experiments; (2) The route length is as the law of
log-normal distribution, the route potential obeys the exponential
distribution, and the travel time is normally distributed as well as the speed;
(3) Taking the short routes unexpectedly cost pedestrians plenty of travel
time, while detour seems to be a time-saving decision. What's more, the series
of experiments can be regarded as a basis of the model evaluation benefit from
the serious conflicts and the symmetric conditions. The evaluation framework
contains four distribution indexes and two time series indexes in space and
time dimensions, and they are respectively graded A traditional social force
model and a Voronoi diagram based modification are introduced to test the
evaluation framework. The evaluation results show that the framework is
beneficial to evaluate pedestrian models and even reflects the minor

examples by evaluating their characteristics and transferability to more
complex models that utilize Image Classification as a subtask.
  We demonstrate the ineffectiveness of adversarial examples when applied to
Instance Segmentation & Object Detection models. We show that this
ineffectiveness arises from the inability of adversarial examples to withstand
transformations such as scaling or a change in lighting conditions. Moreover,
we show that there exists a small threshold below which the adversarial
property is retained while applying these input transformations.
  Additionally, these attacks demonstrate weak cross-network transferability
across neural network architectures, e.g. VGG16 and ResNet50, however, the
attack may fool both the networks if passed sequentially through networks

probability by applying binary tests. It is known that $\Theta(d \log N)$ tests
are necessary and sufficient to recover the defective set with vanishing
probability of error when $d = O(N^{\alpha})$ for some $\alpha \in (0, 1)$.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no explicit (deterministic)
construction achieving $\Theta(d \log N)$ tests in general. In this work, we
show that a famous construction introduced by Kautz and Singleton for the
combinatorial group testing problem (which is known to be suboptimal for
combinatorial group testing for moderate values of $d$) achieves the order
optimal $\Theta(d \log N)$ tests in the probabilistic group testing problem

achieving the order optimal result in the probabilistic group testing setting
for a wide range of values of $d$. To prove the order-optimality of Kautz and
Singleton's construction in the probabilistic setting, we provide a novel
analysis of the probability of a non-defective item being covered by a random
defective set directly, rather than arguing from combinatorial properties of
the underlying code, which has been the main approach in the literature.
Furthermore, we use a recursive technique to convert this construction into one
that can also be efficiently decoded with only a log-log factor increase in the
number of tests.

frequencies, saturates and disappears. The plateau is shown to be determined by
the phononic final-state phase-space available at a given temperature. We
predict that a change of scattering mechanism should also show up in the

strong constraints on the structure of any extended Higgs sector. We consider
the theoretical properties and the phenomenological implications of a generic
two Higgs doublet model (2HDM). This model constitutes a simple and attractive
extension of the SM that is consistent with the observation of the SM-like
Higgs boson and precision electroweak observables, while providing a potential
new source of CP-violation. In this paper we focus on the so-called Higgs
alignment limit of the generic 2HDM, where the neutral scalar field~$H_1$, with
the tree-level couplings of the SM Higgs boson, is a mass eigenstate that is
aligned in field space with the direction of the Higgs vacuum expectation
value. The properties of the two other heavier neutral Higgs scalars, $H_2$ and
$H_3$, in the alignment limit of the 2HDM are also elucidated. It is shown that
the couplings of $H_2$ and $H_3$ in the alignment limit are tightly constrained
and correlated. For example, in the exact alignment limit at tree level, for
bosonic final states $\text{BR}(H_{2,3} \to W^+W^-, ZZ, H_1 Z) = 0$ and
$\text{BR}(H^\pm \to W^\pm H_1) = 0$, whereas for fermionic final states
$\Gamma(H_2 \to f\bar f)/\Gamma(H_3 \to f\bar f) \sim M_2/M_3$ (where
$M_\alpha$ is the mass of $H_\alpha$). In some cases, the results of the
alignment limit differ depending on whether or not alignment is achieved via
the decoupling of heavy scalar states. In particular, in the exact alignment
limit without decoupling $\text{BR}(H_{2,3}\to H_1 H_1)=0$, whereas these
branching ratios are nonzero in the decoupling regime. Observables that could
be used to test the alignment scenario at the LHC are defined and discussed.
The couplings of the Higgs bosons away from their exact alignment values are
determined to leading order, and some consequences are elucidated.

aspect for the realization of a competitive skyrmion based technology beyond

the skyrmion size via the excitation of thermal modes. Here, by taking
advantage of the Hilbert-Huang transform, we demonstrate that at least two
thermal modes can be excited which are non-stationary in time. In addition, one
limit of the rigid skyrmion approximation is that this hypothesis does not
allow for correctly describing the recent experimental evidence of skyrmion
Hall angle dependence on the amplitude of the driving force, which is
proportional to the injected current. In this work, we show that, in an ideal
sample, the combined effect of field-like and damping-like torques on a
breathing skyrmion can indeed give rise to such a current dependent skyrmion
Hall angle. While here we design and control the breathing mode of the
skyrmion, our results can be linked to the experiments by considering that the
thermal fluctuations and/or disorder can excite the breathing mode. We also
propose an experiment to validate our findings.

coupling of spontaneous emission and operate at output powers on the order of
100 nW. We selected pairs of micropillar lasers with almost identical optical
properties in terms of the input-output dependence and the emission energy
which we mutually couple over a distance of about 1\~m and bring into spectral
resonance by precise temperature tuning. By excitation power and detuning
dependent studies we unambiguously identify synchronization of two mutually
coupled high-$\beta$ microlasers via frequency locking associated with a
sub-GHz locking range. A detailed analysis of the synchronization behavior
includes theoretical modeling based on semi-classical stochastic rate equations
and reveals striking differences from optical synchronization in the classical
domain with negligible spontaneous emission noise and optical powers usually
well above the mW range. In particular, we observe deviations from the
classically expected locking slope and broadened locking boundaries which are
successfully explained by the fact the quantum noise plays an important role in
our cavity enhanced optical oscillators. Beyond that, introducing additional
self-feedback to the two mutually coupled microlasers allows us to realize
zero-lag synchronization. Our work provides important insight into

first estimating all the interfering channel strengths then optimizing the
scheduling based on the model. This model-based method is however resource
intensive and computationally hard because channel estimation is expensive in
dense networks; furthermore, finding even a locally optimal solution of the
resulting optimization problem may be computationally complex. This paper shows
that by using a deep learning approach, it is possible to bypass the channel
estimation and to schedule links efficiently based solely on the geographic
locations of the transmitters and the receivers, due to the fact that in many
propagation environments, the wireless channel strength is largely a function
of the distance dependent path-loss. This is accomplished by unsupervised
training over randomly deployed networks, and by using a novel neural network
architecture that computes the geographic spatial convolutions of the
interfering or interfered neighboring nodes along with subsequent multiple
feedback stages to learn the optimum solution. The resulting neural network
gives near-optimal performance for sum-rate maximization and is capable of
generalizing to larger deployment areas and to deployments of different link
densities. Moreover, to provide fairness, this paper proposes a novel
scheduling approach that utilizes the sum-rate optimal scheduling algorithm
over judiciously chosen subsets of links for maximizing a proportional fairness

It is shown that this algebra closes off shell suggesting that these symmetries

channels in the finite, non-asymptotic regime, adaptive strategies can give an
advantage over non-adaptive strategies. However, Hayashi [IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory 55(8), 3807 (2009)] showed that in the asymptotic regime, the
exponential error rate for the discrimination of classical channels is not
improved in the adaptive setting. We extend this result in several ways. First,
we establish the strong Stein's lemma for classical-quantum channels by showing
that asymptotically the exponential error rate for classical-quantum channel
discrimination is not improved by adaptive strategies. Second, we recover many
other classes of channels for which adaptive strategies do not lead to an
asymptotic advantage. Third, we give various converse bounds on the power of
adaptive protocols for general asymptotic quantum channel discrimination.
Intriguingly, it remains open whether adaptive protocols can improve the
exponential error rate for quantum channel discrimination in the asymmetric
Stein setting. Our proofs are based on the concept of amortized
distinguishability of quantum channels, which we analyse using data-processing
inequalities.

In this work, we present a review on current theoretical understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of the protein target search. A comprehensive
discrete-state stochastic method to explain the dynamics of the protein search
phenomena is introduced and explained. Our theoretical approach utilizes a
first-passage analysis and it takes into account the most relevant

of the protein search, including unusually high effective association rates,
high selectivity and specificity, and the robustness in the presence of

high-precision experiments involving atomic transitions and g factor
measurements. In particular, we derive a generalized Dirac Hamiltonian, which
describes both the gravitational coupling for weak fields, as well as the
electromagnetic coupling, e.g., to a central Coulomb field. An approximate form
of this Hamiltonian is used to derive the leading gravitational corrections to
transition frequencies and g factors. The position-dependence of atomic
transitions is shown to be compatible with the equivalence principle, up to a
very good approximation. The compatibility of g factor measurements requires a
deeper, subtle analysis, in order to eventually restore the compliance of g
factor measurements with the equivalence principle. Finally, we analyze small,
but important limitations of Einstein's equivalence principle due to quantum
effects, within high-precision experiments. We also study the relation of these
effects to a conceivable gravitationally induced collapse of a quantum
mechanical wave function (Penrose conjecture), and space-time noncommutativity,
and find that the competing effects should not preclude the measurability of
the higher-order gravitational corrections. Surprisingly large higher-order
gravitational effects are obtained for transitions in diatomic molecules.

of applications. One major challenge it faces is scalability to large software.
This issue is even exacerbated when additional limitations on computing and
storage resources are imposed, as is the case for mobile devices. In such cases
the analysis is performed on a conventional computer. This poses two problems.
First, a man-in-the-middle attack can tamper with an analyzed application. So
once on the mobile device, what guarantees that the actual version is not
corrupt. Second, the analysis itself might be broken leading to an erroneous
result. As a solution, we present DCert a tool for checking and certifying
data-flow properties that consists of two components: a (heavy- weight)
analyzer and a (lightweight) checker. The analyzer is deployed on a
conventional computer. It verifies the conformance of a given application to a
specified policy and generates a certificate attesting the validity of the
analysis result. It suffices then for the checker, on a mobile device, to
perform a linear pass in the application size to validate or refute the
certificate as well as the policy. This allows us to separate the verification
and the checking process while ensuring a trust relationship between them via
the certificate. We describe DCert and report on experimental results obtained
for real-world applications.

Matching conditions provide expressions for different constants whereas
maximization of the anisotropy parameter provides bag constant. By using the

spreading. If inflammation is recognized to favor the formation of vascular
metastatic niches, little is known about the contribution of blood rheology to
CTC deposition. Herein, a microfluidic chip, covered by a confluent monolayer
of endothelial cells, is used for analyzing the adhesion and rolling of
colorectal (HCT 15) and breast (MDA MB 231) cancer cells under different
biophysical conditions. These include the analysis of cell transport in a
physiological solution and whole blood; over a healthy and a TNF alpha inflamed
endothelium; with a flow rate of 50 and 100 nL/min. Upon stimulation of the
endothelial monolayer with TNF alpha (25 ng/mL), CTC adhesion increases by 2 to
4 times whilst cell rolling velocity only slightly reduces. Notably, whole
blood also enhances cancer cell deposition by 2 to 3 times, but only on the
unstimulated vasculature. For all tested conditions, no statistically
significant difference is observed between the two cancer cell types. Finally,
a computational model for CTC transport demonstrates that a rigid cell
approximation reasonably predicts rolling velocities while cell deformability
is needed to model adhesion. These results would suggest that, within
microvascular networks, blood rheology and inflammation contribute similarly to
CTC deposition thereby facilitating the formation of metastatic niches along
the entire network, including the healthy endothelium. In microfluidic based
assays, neglecting blood rheology would significantly underestimate the
metastatic potential of cancer cells.
