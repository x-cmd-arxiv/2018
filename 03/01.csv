large number of noisy randomly shifted observations. Specifically, we estimate
the mean, power spectrum, and bispectrum of the signal from the observations.
Since bispectrum contains the phase information of the signal, reliable
algorithms for bispectrum inversion is useful in many applications. We propose
a new algorithm using spectral decomposition of the normalized bispectrum
matrix for this task. For clean signals, we show that the eigenvectors of the
normalized bispectrum matrix correspond to the true phases of the signal and
its shifted copies. In addition, the spectral method is robust to noise. It can
be used as a stable and efficient initialization technique for local non-convex
optimization for bispectrum inversion.

This paper extends our previous work in the following two aspects. First,
methodology-wise we experiment with a new architecture that does not need any
recurrent layers, making the training process faster. Moreover, we compare a
late-fusion variant and an early-fusion variant to study which one better
exploits the attention mechanism. Second, we conduct and report an extensive
set of experiments comparing the proposed attention-based methods against a
heuristic energy-based method, a structural repetition-based method, and a few
other simple feature-based methods for this task. Due to the lack of
public-domain labeled data for highlight extraction, following our previous

Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies (STRATOS) Initiative, a Task
Group on measurement error and misclassification (TG4) seeks to describe the
scope of this problem and the analysis methods currently in use to address
measurement error. Methods: TG4 conducted a literature survey of four types of
research studies that are typically impacted by exposure measurement error: 1)
dietary intake cohort studies, 2) dietary intake population surveys, 3)
physical activity cohort studies, and 4) air pollution cohort studies. The
survey was conducted to understand current practice for acknowledging and
addressing measurement error. Results: The survey revealed that while
researchers were generally aware that measurement error affected their studies,
very few adjusted their analysis for the error. Most articles provided
incomplete discussion of the potential effects of measurement error on their
results. Regression calibration was the most widely used method of adjustment.
Conclusions: Even in areas of epidemiology where measurement error is a known
problem, the dominant current practice is to ignore errors in analyses. Methods
to correct for measurement error are available but require additional data to
inform the error structure. There is a great need to incorporate such data
collection within study designs and improve the analytical approach. Increased
efforts by investigators, editors and reviewers are also needed to improve
presentation of research when data are subject to error.

This is shown analytically using the structure factor $S(k)$, proportional to

improve the safety of such systems. Uncertainty in predictive can result from
uncertainty in model parameters, irreducible data uncertainty and uncertainty
due to distributional mismatch between the test and training data
distributions. Different actions might be taken depending on the source of the
uncertainty so it is important to be able to distinguish between them.
Recently, baseline tasks and metrics have been defined and several practical
methods to estimate uncertainty developed. These methods, however, attempt to
model uncertainty due to distributional mismatch either implicitly through
model uncertainty or as data uncertainty. This work proposes a new framework
for modeling predictive uncertainty called Prior Networks (PNs) which
explicitly models distributional uncertainty. PNs do this by parameterizing a
prior distribution over predictive distributions. This work focuses on
uncertainty for classification and evaluates PNs on the tasks of identifying
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples and detecting misclassification on the MNIST
dataset, where they are found to outperform previous methods. Experiments on
synthetic and MNIST and CIFAR-10 data show that unlike previous non-Bayesian
methods PNs are able to distinguish between data and distributional

Chignolin mini-protein as our test cases, we illustrate how the distance to the
Support Vector Machines' decision hyperplane, the output probability estimates
from Logistic Regression, the outputs from deep neural network classifiers, and
other classifiers may be used to reversibly sample slow structural transitions.
We discuss the utility of other SML algorithms that might be useful for

in the Universe. We study the evolution of the axion dark matter distribution
in the central region of a halo, assuming the mass is dominated by this axion
field, and that gravity is the only important interaction. We calculate the
excited axion states in the spherical gravitational potential generated by the
self-gravitating ground-state, also known as soliton. These excited states are
similar to the states of the hydrogen atom with quantum numbers $(n,l,m)$, here
designating oscillation modes of a classical wave. At fixed $n$, the modes with
highest $l$ have the lowest energy because of the extended mass distribution
generating the potential. We use an approximate analytical treatment to derive
the distribution of mass in these states when a steady-state is reached by
dynamical relaxation, and find that a corona with a mass density profile $\rho
\propto r^{-5/3}$ should be set up around the central soliton, analogous to the
Bahcall-Wolf cusp predicted for the stellar distribution around a central black
hole. The central soliton accretes dark matter from the corona as dynamical
relaxation proceeds and negative orbital energy flows out. This density profile
should remain valid out to the radius where the mass in the corona is
comparable to the mass of the central soliton; further than that, the
gravitational potential depends on the initial distribution of dark matter and
the relaxation time increases rapidly with radius.

its associated ""curse of dimensionality"" particularly for problems involving a

without the injection of $\sim 2.5$ mm diameter bubbles (corresponding to $Re_b
\approx 600$) in a rectangular water column heated from one side and cooled
from the other. The gas volume fraction $\alpha$ was varied in the range $0\% -
5\%$, and the Rayleigh number $Ra_H$ in the range $4.0 \times 10^9 - 1.2 \times
10^{11}$. We find that the global heat transfer is enhanced up to 20 times due
to bubble injection. Interestingly, for bubbly flow, for our lowest
concentration $\alpha = 0.5\% $ onwards, the Nusselt number $\overline{Nu}$ is
nearly independent of $Ra_H$, and depends solely on the gas volume
fraction~$\alpha$. We observe the scaling $\overline{Nu} \propto
\alpha^{0.45}$, which is suggestive of a diffusive transport mechanism. Through
local temperature measurements, we show that the bubbles induce a huge increase
in the strength of liquid temperature fluctuations, e.g. by a factor of 200 for
$\alpha = 0.9\%$. Further, we compare the power spectra of the temperature
fluctuations for the single- and two-phase cases. In the single-phase cases,
most of the spectral power of the temperature fluctuations is concentrated in
the large-scale rolls. However, with the injection of bubbles, we observe
intense fluctuations over a wide range of scales, extending up to very high
frequencies. Thus, while in the single-phase flow the thermal boundary layers
control the heat transport, once the bubbles are injected, the bubble-induced
liquid agitation governs the process from a very small bubble concentration
onwards.

towards the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to automatically
determine the Bravais lattice symmetry present in atomically-resolved images. A
DCNN is trained to identify the Bravais lattice class given a 2D fast Fourier
transform of the input image. Monte-Carlo dropout is used for determining the
prediction probability, and results are shown for both simulated and real
atomically-resolved images from scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning
transmission electron microscopy. A reduced representation of the final layer
output allows to visualize the separation of classes in the DCNN and agrees
with physical intuition. We then apply the trained network to electron
beam-induced transformations in WS2, which allows tracking and determination of
growth rate of voids. These results are novel in two ways: (1) It shows that
DCNNs can be trained to recognize diffraction patterns, which is markedly
different from the typical ""real image"" cases, and (2) it provides a method
with in-built uncertainty quantification, allowing the real-time analysis of
phases present in atomically resolved images.

upon heating; it can be characterised by several methods and parameters and is
frequently used to retrieve glass-forming ability (GFA) of corresponding
liquids as the case with which such liquids can be made crystal free via
melt-quenching. Here, GS has been determined for the first time on six
sub-alkaline glasses having complex (natural) compositions, the most widespread
and abundant on Earth. KT, KH, KW, KLL and w2 GS parameters increase linearly
and monotonically as a function of SiO2, with very high correlations. Moreover,
Tx values and GS parameters highly correlate with GFA via Rc (critical cooling
rate), previously determined with ex-situ cooling-induced experiments.
Therefore, GS scales with GFA for natural silicate compositions. In addition,
the in-situ Rc value of B100 measured with DSC results > 45 {\deg}C/min (> 2700
{\deg}C/h), broadly corroborating the Rc of about 150 {\deg}C/min (9000

heating or cooling can be obtained by DSC investigations also for chemically
complex (natural) systems, similar to simple silicate systems. These outcomes
are relevant for lavas or magmas that re-heat glass-bearing volcanic rocks, as
well as for fabricate glass-ceramic materials with desirable texture and
composition of phases starting from abundant and very cheap raw volcanic rocks.

scenarios with light neutralinos and charginos other than the neutralino
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), more than one decay mode of the stop

current stop search limits at the LHC, they also offer alternative discovery
channels for stop searches. In this paper, we studied the scenario with light
Higgsino next-to-LSPs (NLSPs) and Bino LSP. The light stop decays primarily via
$\tilde t_1 \to t \chi_2^0/\chi_3^0$, with the neutralinos subsequent decaying
to a $Z$ boson or a Higgs boson: $\chi_2^0/\chi^0_3 \to \chi_1^0 h/Z$. Pair

index. Moreover, the short range order of a photonic glass alone is also
insufficient to cause sharp spectral features. We show here, that the

shifting the first zero position of the motif Fourier transform to smaller wave

ages between ~40 and ~1000 Myrs and of different masses. Our goal is to
investigate for the first time the occurrence of multiple populations in a
large sample of young clusters. We find that all the clusters exhibit the eMSTO
phenomenon and that MS stars more massive than ~1.6 solar masses define a blue
and red MS, with the latter hosting the majority of MS stars. The comparison
between the observations and isochrones suggests that the blue MSs are made of
slow-rotating stars, while the red MSs host stars with rotational velocities
close to the breakup value. About half of the bright MS stars in the youngest
clusters are H-alpha emitters. These Be stars populate the red MS and the
reddest part of the eMSTO thus supporting the idea that the red MS is made of
fast rotators. We conclude that the split MS and the eMSTO are a common feature
of young clusters in both Magellanic Clouds. The phenomena of a split MS and an
eMSTO occur for stars that are more massive than a specific threshold which is
independent of the host-cluster mass. As a by-product, we report the

known for producing appealing samples, but they are notably difficult to train.
One common way to tackle this issue has been to propose new formulations of the
GAN objective. Yet, surprisingly few studies have looked at optimization
methods designed for this adversarial training. In this work, we cast GAN
optimization problems in the general variational inequality framework. Tapping
into the mathematical programming literature, we counter some common
misconceptions about the difficulties of saddle point optimization and propose
to extend techniques designed for variational inequalities to the training of
GANs. We apply averaging, extrapolation and a computationally cheaper variant
that we call extrapolation from the past to the stochastic gradient method
(SGD) and Adam.

  Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS)",,"10.1007/s11548-018-1728-4",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The standard clinical treatment of Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome
consists in the photo-coagulation of undesired anastomoses located on the
placenta which are responsible to a blood transfer between the two twins. While
being the standard of care procedure, fetoscopy suffers from a limited
field-of-view of the placenta resulting in missed anastomoses. To facilitate
the task of the clinician, building a global map of the placenta providing a
larger overview of the vascular network is highly desired. Methods: To overcome
the challenging visual conditions inherent to in vivo sequences (low contrast,
obstructions or presence of artifacts, among others), we propose the following
contributions: (i) robust pairwise registration is achieved by aligning the
orientation of the image gradients, and (ii) difficulties regarding long-range
consistency (e.g. due to the presence of outliers) is tackled via a bag-of-word
strategy, which identifies overlapping frames of the sequence to be registered
regardless of their respective location in time. Results: In addition to visual
difficulties, in vivo sequences are characterised by the intrinsic absence of
gold standard. We present mosaics motivating qualitatively our methodological
choices and demonstrating their promising aspect. We also demonstrate
semi-quantitatively, via visual inspection of registration results, the
efficacy of our registration approach in comparison to two standard baselines.
Conclusion: This paper proposes the first approach for the construction of
mosaics of placenta in in vivo fetoscopy sequences. Robustness to visual
challenges during registration and long-range temporal consistency are
proposed, offering first positive results on in vivo data for which standard
mosaicking techniques are not applicable.

extraction from quantum states. As these bounds are derived in a very general

showing that optimal work extraction is possible for a realistic engine. The
latter consists of a superconducting circuit, where a LC-resonator is coupled
to a Josephson junction. The oscillator state fuels the engine, providing
energy absorbed by Cooper pairs, thus producing work in the form of an
electrical current against an external voltage bias. We show that this machine
can extract the maximal amount of work from all Gaussian and Fock states.
Furthermore, we consider work extraction from a continuously stabilized
oscillator state. In both scenarios, coherence between energy eigenstates is
beneficial, increasing the power output of the machine. This is possible
because the phase difference across the Josephson junction provides a phase
reference.

superconductors (FeSCs). The presumed $s^{\pm}$ character of these
superconductors means that the condensate is not symmetry protected against
Coulomb repulsion. Remarkably, the transition temperatures and the excitation
gap are quite robust across the large family of iron based superconductors,
despite drastic changes in Fermi surface geometry. The Coulomb problem is to
understand how these superconductors avoid the strong onsite Coulomb
interaction at the iron atoms, while maintaining a robust transition
temperature. Within the dominant space of $t_{2g}$ orbitals, on-site repulsion
in the FeSCs enforces two linearly independent components of the condensate to
vanish. This raises the possibility that iron-based superconductors might adapt
their condensate to the Coulomb constraints by rotating the pairing state
within the large manifold of entangled, extended s-wave gap functions with
different orbital and momentum space structure. We examine this ""orbital and
k-space flexibility"" (OKF) mechanism using both Landau theory and microscopic
calculations within a multi-orbital t-J model. Based on our results, we
conclude that OKF necessitates a large condensate degeneracy. One interesting
possibility raised by our results, is that a resolution to the Coulomb problem

unsupervised decomposition of a network into structural groups based on
statistical regularities in the network's connectivity. Although many methods
exist, the No Free Lunch theorem for community detection implies that each
makes some kind of tradeoff, and no algorithm can be optimal on all inputs.
Thus, different algorithms will over or underfit on different inputs, finding
more, fewer, or just different communities than is optimal, and evaluation
methods that use a metadata partition as a ground truth will produce misleading
conclusions about general accuracy. Here, we present a broad evaluation of over
and underfitting in community detection, comparing the behavior of 16
state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on a novel and structurally
diverse corpus of 406 real-world networks. We find that (i) algorithms vary
widely both in the number of communities they find and in their corresponding
composition, given the same input, (ii) algorithms can be clustered into
distinct high-level groups based on similarities of their outputs on real-world
networks, and (iii) these differences induce wide variation in accuracy on link
prediction and link description tasks. We introduce a new diagnostic for
evaluating overfitting and underfitting in practice, and use it to roughly
divide community detection methods into general and specialized learning
algorithms. Across methods and inputs, Bayesian techniques based on the
stochastic block model and a minimum description length approach to
regularization represent the best general learning approach, but can be
outperformed under specific circumstances. These results introduce both a
theoretically principled approach to evaluate over and underfitting in models
of network community structure and a realistic benchmark by which new methods

theory of traversals, a term-tree traversing technique inspired from Game
Semantics, with judicious use of the eta-conversion rule of the lambda
calculus.
  The traversal theory of the simply-typed lambda calculus relies on the
eta-long transform to ensure that when traversing an application, there is a
subterm representing every possible operator's argument. In the untyped
setting, we instead exhibit the missing operand via ad-hoc instantiation of the
eta-expansion rule, which allows the traversal to proceed as if the operand
existed in the original term. This gives rise to a more generic concept of
traversals for lambda terms. A notable improvement, in addition to handling
untyped terms, is that no preliminary transformation is required: the original
unaltered lambda term is traversed.
  We show that by bounding the non-determinism of the traversal rule for free
variables, one can effectively compute a set of traversals characterizing the
paths in the tree representation of the beta-normal form, when it exists. This
yields an evaluation algorithm for untyped lambda-terms. We prove correctness
by showing that traversals implement leftmost linear reduction, a
generalization of the head linear reduction of Danos et. al.

finite-volume/finite-element (FV/FE) method for the resolution of weakly
compressible flows in two and three space dimensions. The pressure-based
methodology introduced in Berm\'udez et al. 2014 and Busto et al. 2018 for
viscous incompressible flows is extended here to solve the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. Instead of considering the classical system including
the energy conservation equation, we replace it by the pressure evolution
equation written in non-conservative form. To ease the discretization of
complex spatial domains, face-type unstructured staggered meshes are
considered. A projection method allows the decoupling of the computation of the
density and linear momentum variables from the pressure. Then, an explicit
finite volume scheme is used for the resolution of the transport diffusion
equations on the dual mesh, whereas the pressure system is solved implicitly by
using continuous finite elements defined on the primal simplex mesh.
Consequently, the CFL stability condition depends only on the flow velocity,
avoiding the severe time restrictions that might be imposed by the sound
velocity in the weakly compressible regime. High order of accuracy in space and
time of the transport diffusion stage is attained using a local ADER (LADER)
methodology. Moreover, also the CVC Kolgan-type second order in space and first
order in time scheme is considered. To prevent spurious oscillations in the
presence of shocks, an ENO-based reconstruction, the minmod limiter or the
Barth-Jespersen limiter are employed. To show the validity and robustness of
our novel staggered semi-implicit hybrid FV/FE scheme, several benchmarks are
analysed, showing a good agreement with available exact solutions and numerical
reference data from low Mach numbers, up to Mach numbers of the order of unity.

interpretation of disease-related metabolomic phenotypes, and facilitates

these data are increasingly collected in large cohorts, driving a need for the
development of novel methods for their integration. Of note,
clinical/translational studies typically provide snapshot gene and metabolite
profiles and, oftentimes, most metabolites are not identified. Thus, in these
types of studies, pathway/network approaches that take into account the
complexity of gene-metabolite relationships may neither be applicable nor
readily uncover novel relationships. With this in mind, we propose a simple
linear modeling approach to capture phenotype-specific gene-metabolite
associations, with the assumption that co-regulation patterns reflect
functionally related genes and metabolites. The proposed linear model,
metabolite ~ gene + phenotype + gene:phenotype, specifically evaluates whether
gene-metabolite relationships differ by phenotype, by testing whether the
relationship in one phenotype is significantly different from the relationship
in another phenotype (via an interaction gene:phenotype p-value). Interaction
p-values for all possible gene-metabolite pairs are computed and significant
pairs are clustered by the directionality of associations. We implemented our
approach as an R package, IntLIM, which includes a user-friendly Shiny app. We
applied IntLIM to two published datasets, collected in NCI-60 cell lines and in
human breast tumor and non-tumor tissue. We demonstrate that IntLIM captures
relevant tumor-specific gene-metabolite associations involved in cancer-related

candidates for non-volatile memories as well as artificial synapses due to
their memristive behavior. The main physical and chemical phenomena which
define their functionality are driven by externally applied voltages, and the
resulting electric fields. Although molecular dynamics simulations are widely
used in order to describe the dynamics on the corresponding atomic length and
time scales, there is a lack of models which allow for the actual driving force
of the dynamics, i.e. externally applied electric fields. This is due to the
restriction of currently applied models to either solely conductive,
non-reactive or insulating materials, with thicknesses in the order of the
potential cutoff radius, i.e., 10 \r{A}. In this work, we propose a generic
model, which can be applied in particular to describe the resistive switching
phenomena of metal-insulator-metal systems. It has been shown that the
calculated electric field and force distribution in case of the chosen example
system Cu/a-SiO$_2$/Cu are in agreement with fundamental field theoretical
expectations.

which responds to the emerging demand for 3D movies or AR/VR. We start with a
careful examination of applying existing monocular style transfer methods to
left and right views of stereoscopic images separately. This reveals that the
original disparity consistency cannot be well preserved in the final
stylization results, which causes 3D fatigue to the viewers. To address this
issue, we incorporate a new disparity loss into the widely adopted style loss
function by enforcing the bidirectional disparity constraint in non-occluded
regions. For a practical real-time solution, we propose the first feed-forward
network by jointly training a stylization sub-network and a disparity
sub-network, and integrate them in a feature level middle domain. Our disparity
sub-network is also the first end-to-end network for simultaneous bidirectional
disparity and occlusion mask estimation. Finally, our network is effectively
extended to stereoscopic videos, by considering both temporal coherence and
disparity consistency. We will show that the proposed method clearly
outperforms the baseline algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.

number of tasks, aided by recent advances in deep learning. However, they tend
to suffer from high sample complexity, which hinders their use in real-world
domains. Alternatively, model-based reinforcement learning promises to reduce
sample complexity, but tends to require careful tuning and to date have
succeeded mainly in restrictive domains where simple models are sufficient for
learning. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of vanilla model-based
reinforcement learning methods when deep neural networks are used to learn both
the model and the policy, and show that the learned policy tends to exploit
regions where insufficient data is available for the model to be learned,
causing instability in training. To overcome this issue, we propose to use an
ensemble of models to maintain the model uncertainty and regularize the
learning process. We further show that the use of likelihood ratio derivatives
yields much more stable learning than backpropagation through time. Altogether,
our approach Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO)
significantly reduces the sample complexity compared to model-free deep RL

potential wells of radius $R_p$ arranged in a regular square or hexagonal

threshold is higher than the one for clean (non-patterned) substrates if the

$CP$-violating pseudoscalar hypermeson decays of the form
$\widetilde\eta\rightarrow \widetilde\pi\widetilde\pi\rightarrow 4V$. The

experimentally identifiable effects on the phenomenology of magnetization

dynamics of chiral magnets allows for a concise interpretation of domain wall
creep motion. We also argue that the conventional creep theory of the domain

evidence to support the scenario that umbral shock events cause expansion of
the embedded magnetic field lines due to the increased adiabatic pressure. The
large number statistics employed allow us to calculate the adiabatic index,
gamma = 1.12 +/- 0.01, for chromospheric umbral locations. Examination of the
vector magnetic field fluctuations perpendicular to the solar normal revealed
changes up to ~200 G at the locations of umbral flashes. Such transversal
magnetic field fluctuations have not been described before. Through comparisons
with non-linear force-free field extrapolations, we find that the perturbations
of the transverse field components are orientated in the same direction as the
quiescent field geometries. This implies that magnetic field enhancements
produced by umbral flashes are directed along the motion path of the developing
shock, hence producing relatively small changes, up to a maximum of ~8 degrees,
in the inclination and/or azimuthal directions of the magnetic field.
Importantly, this work highlights that umbral flashes are able to modify the

imaging to extract broadband photometry of the resolved stellar populations
surrounding this event. Using this photometry, we fit stellar evolution models
to the color-magnitude diagrams to measure the recent star formation history
(SFH). Modeling the photometry requires an accurate distance; therefore, we
measure the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and infer a distance modulus of
$29.47 \pm 0.079$ to NGC~6946, or a metric distance of $7.83 \pm 0.29$ Mpc. To
estimate the stellar population's age, we convert the SFH and uncertainties
into a probabilistic distribution for the progenitor's age. The region in the
immediate vicinity of N6946-BH1 exhibits the youngest and most vigorous star
formation for several hundred pc. This suggests that the progenitor is not a
runaway star. From these measurements, we infer an age for the BH progenitor of
$10.6^{+14.5}_{-5.9}$ Myr. Assuming that the progenitor evolved effectively as
a single star, this corresponds to an initial mass of $17.9^{+29.9}_{-7.6}$

dust emission arising from the circumstellar material in the envelope of B335
is detected at all scales probed by our observations, from radii of 50 to 1000
au. The magnetic field structure producing the dust polarization has a very
ordered topology in the inner envelope, with a transition from a large-scale
poloidal magnetic field, in the outflow direction, to strongly pinched in the
equatorial direction. This is probably due to magnetic field lines being
dragged along the dominating infall direction since B335 does not exhibit
prominent rotation. Our data and their qualitative comparison to a family of
magnetized protostellar collapse models show that, during the magnetized
collapse in B335, the magnetic field is maintaining a high level of
organization from scales 1000 au to 50 au: this suggests the field is
dynamically relevant and capable of influencing the typical outcome of
protostellar collapse, such as regulating the disk size in B335.

that correlate with the bulge-to-total mass ratios. The structural-dynamical
properties of the simulated galaxies are consistent with observed
Faber-Jackson, Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher relations. However, the

slightly delayed formation and more prominent inside-out growth mode than
observational inferences based on the fossil record method. The main structural

indicator of diseases like glaucoma, hypertension and diabetic retinopathy. The
accuracy of retinal blood vessels segmentation affects the quality of retinal
image analysis which is used in diagnosis methods in modern ophthalmology.
Contrast enhancement is one of the crucial steps in any of retinal blood vessel
segmentation approaches. The reliability of the segmentation depends on the
consistency of the contrast over the image. This paper presents an assessment
of the suitability of a recently invented spatially adaptive contrast
enhancement technique for enhancing retinal fundus images for blood vessel
segmentation. The enhancement technique was integrated with a variant of Tyler
Coye algorithm, which has been improved with Hough line transformation based
vessel reconstruction method. The proposed approach was evaluated on two public
datasets STARE and DRIVE. The assessment was done by comparing the segmentation
performance with five widely used contrast enhancement techniques based on
wavelet transform, contrast limited histogram equalization, local
normalization, linear un-sharp masking and contourlet transform. The results
revealed that the assessed enhancement technique is well suited for the
application and also outperforms all compared techniques.

the dimension of the smallest such system that reproduces these observed

by Ho and Kalman reveals the McMillan degree as the rank of a Hankel matrix
built from these measurements. However, if measurements are contaminated by
noise, this Hankel matrix will almost surely be full rank. Hence practitioners
often estimate the rank of this matrix---and thus the McMillan degree---by
manually setting a threshold between the large singular values that correspond
to the non-zero singular values of the noise-free Hankel matrix and the small
singular values that are pertubations of the zero singular values. Here we
introduce a probabilistic upper bound on the perturbation of the singular
values of this Hankel matrix when measurements are corrupted by additive
Gaussian noise, and hence provide guidance on setting the threshold to obtain a
lower bound on the McMillan degree. This result is powered by a new,
probabilistic bound on the 2-norm of a random Hankel matrix with normally
distributed entries. Unlike existing results for random Hankel matrices, this
bound features no unknown constants and, moreover, is within a small factor of
the empirically observed bound when entries are independent and identically
distributed. This bound on the McMillan degree provides an inexpensive
alternative to more general model order selection techniques such as the Akaike

exhibits several power-law-like frequency ranges with a well defined break
between approximately 0.1 and 1 Hz in the spacecraft frame. The exact
dependence of this break scale on solar wind parameters has been extensively
studied but is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that
reconnection may induce a break in the spectrum at a ""disruption scale""
$\lambda_D$, which may be larger than the fundamental ion kinetic scales,
producing an unusually steep spectrum just below the break. We present a
statistical investigation of the dependence of the break scale on the proton
gyroradius $\rho_i$, ion inertial length $d_i$, ion sound radius $\rho_s$,
proton-cyclotron resonance scale $\rho_c$ and disruption scale $\lambda_D$ as a
function of $\beta_{\perp i}$. We find that the steepest spectral indices of
the dissipation range occur when $\beta_e$ is in the range of 0.1-1 and the
break scale is only slightly larger than the ion sound scale (a situation
occurring 41% of the time at 1 AU), in qualitative agreement with the
reconnection model. In this range the break scale shows remarkably good
correlation with $\lambda_D$. Our findings suggest that, at least at low
$\beta_e$, reconnection may play an important role in the development of the

primary metric of interest. Binary classifiers which face class imbalance are
often evaluated by the $F_\beta$ score, area under the precision-recall curve,
Precision at K, and more. The maximization of many of these metrics can be
expressed as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraint is a
function of the classifier's predictions.
  In this paper we propose a novel framework for learning with constraints that
can be expressed as a predicted positive rate (or negative rate) on a subset of
the training data. We explicitly model the threshold at which a classifier must
operate to satisfy the constraint, yielding a surrogate loss function which
avoids the complexity of constrained optimization. The method is model-agnostic

experiments showed that the force decays exponentially but the characteristic
decay length in a concentrated electrolyte is significantly larger than what
liquid-state theories predict based on analysing correlation functions in the
bulk electrolyte. Inspired by the classical Casimir effect, we consider an
alternative mechanism for force generation, namely the confinement of density
fluctuations in the electrolyte by the walls. We show analytically within the
random phase approximation, which assumes the ions to be point charges, that
this fluctuation-induced force is attractive and also decays exponentially,
albeit with a decay length that is half of the bulk correlation length. These
predictions change dramatically when excluded volume effects are accounted for
within the mean spherical approximation. At high ion concentrations the Casimir
force is found to be exponentially damped oscillatory as a function of the
distance between the confining surfaces. Our analysis does not resolve the
riddle of the anomalously long screening length observed in experiments, but
suggests that the Casimir force due to mode restriction in density fluctuations

stars, giving a detection rate of 17.1+2.6-2.3 per cent, with lower rates for
later spectral types. For each target a blackbody spectrum was fitted to the
dust emission to determine its fractional luminosity and temperature. The
derived under- lying distribution of fractional luminosity versus blackbody
radius in the population showed that most detected discs are concentrated at f
~ 10^-5 and at temperatures corresponding to blackbody radii 7-40 AU, which
scales to ~40 AU for realistic dust properties (similar to the current Kuiper
belt). Two outlying populations are also evident; five stars have exceptionally
bright emission ( f > 5x10^-5), and one has unusually hot dust < 4 AU. The
excess emission distributions at all wavelengths were fitted with a
steady-state evolution model, showing these are compatible with all stars being
born with a narrow belt that then undergoes collisional grinding. However, the
model cannot explain the hot dust systems - likely originating in transient
events - and bright emission systems - arising potentially from atypically
massive discs or recent stirring. The emission from the present-day Kuiper belt
is predicted to be close to the median of the population, suggesting that half
of stars have either depleted their Kuiper belts (similar to the Solar System),
or had a lower planetesimal formation efficiency.

lattice disordering, manifest as distinct and quantifiable reciprocal-space

proceeds through intrinsic heat flow, between their electrons and their
lattice, and extrinsic heat flow between the nanoclusters and their substrate.
For an in-depth understanding of this process, we have extended the
two-temperature model to the case of 0D/2D heterostructures and used it to
describe energy flow among the various subsystems, to quantify interfacial
coupling constants, and to elucidate the role of the optical and thermal
substrate properties. When lattice heating of Au nanoclusters is dominated by
intrinsic heat flow, a reversible disordering of atomic positions occurs, which
is absent when heat is injected as hot substrate-phonons. The present analysis
indicates that hot electrons can distort the lattice of nanoclusters, even if
the lattice temperature is below the equilibrium threshold for surface
pre-melting. Based on simple considerations, the effect is interpreted as
activation of surface diffusion due to modifications of the potential energy
surface at high electronic temperatures. We discuss the implications of such a

over M. The BFV formulation of the constrained system is given by the
Hamiltonian lift of the Vaintrob description (E[1],Q) of the Lie algebroid to
its cotangent bundle T*E[1]. Affine deformations of the constraints are
parametrized by the first Lie algebroid cohomology H^1_Q and lead to
irreducible constraints also for much more general Lie algebroids such as Dirac
structures; the modified BFV function follows by the addition of a
representative of the deformation charge.
  Adding a Hamiltonian to the system corresponds to a metric g on M. Evolution
invariance of the constraint surface introduces a connection nabla on E and one
reobtains the compatibility of g with (E,rho,nabla) found previously in the
literature. The covariantization of the Hamiltonian to a function on T*E[1]
serves as a BFV-Hamiltonian, iff, in addition, this connection is compatible
with the Lie algebroid structure, turning (E, rho, [ , ], nabla) into a
Cartan-Lie algebroid. The BV formulation of the system is obtained from BFV by
a (time-dependent) AKSZ procedure.

Type 2 AGN and intermediate sources that have broad H$\alpha$ emission and
significantly narrower H$\beta$. Using both [OIII] luminosities and AGN
luminosities derived from optical-IR spectral energy distribution fitting, we
find evidence for enhanced large-scale obscuration in the obscured sources. In
matched bins of luminosity we find that the obscured population typically has
broader, more blueshifted \OIII\ emission than in the unobscured sample,
suggestive of more powerful AGN-driven outflows. This trend is not seen in
spectroscopically classified samples, and is unlikely to be entirely explained
by orientation effects. In addition, outflow velocities increase from small to
moderate AGN $E(B-V)$ values, before flattening out (as traced by FWHM) and
even decreasing (as traced by blueshift). While difficult to fully interpret in
a single physical model, due to both the averaging over populations and the
spatially-averaged spectra, these results agree with previous findings that
simple geometric unification models are insufficient for the IR-selected AGN

As we do not track partial ionization of HeII, the extent of the double ionized
helium (HeIII) regions is consistently smaller. In contrast to previous
comparison projects, the ionizing emissivity in our semi-numerical scheme is
not adjusted to reproduce the redshift evolution of the RT simulation, but
directly derived from the RT simulation spectra. Among schemes that identify
the ionized regions by the ratio of the number of ionization and absorption
events on different spatial smoothing scales, we find those that mark the
entire sphere as ionized when the ionization criterion is fulfilled to result
in significantly accelerated reionization compared to the RT simulation.
Conversely, those that flag only the central cell as ionized yield very similar
but slightly delayed redshift evolution of reionization, with up to 20%
ionizing photons lost. Despite the overall agreement with the RT simulation,
our results suggests that constraining ionizing emissivity sensitive parameters
from semi-numerical galaxy formation-reionization models are subject to photon
nonconservation.

random circuit dynamics, we provide evidence that the leading-order
entanglement dynamics of a given chaotic system are determined by a function
$\mathcal{E}(v)$, which is model-dependent, but which we argue satisfies
certain general constraints. In a minimal membrane picture, $\mathcal{E}(v)$ is
the ""surface tension"" of the membrane and is a function of the membrane's
orientation $v$ in spacetime. For one-dimensional (1D) systems this surface
tension is related by a Legendre transformation to an entanglement entropy
growth rate $\Gamma(\partial S/\partial x)$ which depends on the spatial
""gradient"" of the entanglement entropy $S(x,t)$ across the cut at position $x$.
We show how to extract the entanglement growth functions numerically in 1D at
infinite temperature using the concept of the operator entanglement of the time
evolution operator, and we discuss possible universality of $\mathcal{E}$ at
low temperatures. Our theoretical ideas are tested against and informed by
numerical results for a quantum-chaotic 1D spin Hamiltonian. These results are
relevant to the broad class of chaotic many-particle systems or field theories

separate region between broad line region (BLR) and narrow line region (NLR).
In this paper we explore the emission from intermediate line region (ILR) by
using the photoionization simulations of the gas clouds distributed radially
from the AGN center. The gas clouds span distances typical for BLR, ILR and
NLR, and the appearance of dust at the sublimation radius is fully taken into
account in our model. Single cloud structure is calculated under the assumption
of the constant pressure. We show that the slope of the power law cloud density
radial profile does not affect the existence of ILR in major types of AGN. We
found that the low ionization iron line, Fe~II, appears to be highly sensitive
for the presence of dust and therefore becomes potential tracer of dust content
in line emitting regions. We show that the use of disk-like cloud density
profile computed at the upper part of the accretion disc atmosphere reproduces
the observed properties of the line emissivities. In particular, the distance
of H${\beta}$ line inferred from our model agrees with that obtained from the
reverberation mapping studies in Sy1 galaxy NGC 5548.

performance for applications like low-dose CT or various sparse data problems.
However, there are few theoretical results for deep learning in inverse

data consistent solutions having small value of a regularizer defined by a
trained neural network. We derive well-posedness results and quantitative error
estimates, and propose a possible strategy for training the regularizer. Our
theoretical results and framework are different from any previous work using
neural networks for solving inverse problems. A possible data driven
regularizer is proposed. Numerical results are presented for a tomographic
sparse data problem, which demonstrate good performance of NETT even for
unknowns of different type from the training data. To derive the convergence

item recall probability using a multiple logistic regression (MLR) model based
on previous answer correctness and temporal spacing of study. Prompted by

an exponential decay (Wickelgren 1974), we compare the MLR approach with a
Recurrent Power Law (RPL) model which adaptively fits a forgetting curve. We

nonlinear dynamical systems, we show that cooperation through generalized
reciprocity always emerges as the unique attractor in which the overall level
of cooperation is maximized, while simultaneously exploitation of the
participating individuals is prevented. The analysis elucidates the role of the
network structure, here captured by a local centrality measure which uniquely
quantifies the propensity of the network structure to cooperation, by dictating
the degree of cooperation displayed both at microscopic and macroscopic level.
We demonstrate the applicability of the analysis on a practical example by
considering an interaction structure that couples a donation process with a
public goods game.

finite-length nested codes for modern nonvolatile memories suffering from both
permanent defects and transient errors (erasures or random errors). A nested
coding approach such as partitioned codes can handle both permanent defects and
transient errors by using two parts of redundancy: 1) redundancy to deal with
permanent defects and 2) redundancy for transient errors. We consider two
different channel models of the binary defect and erasure channel (BDEC) and
the binary defect and symmetric channel (BDSC). The transient errors of the
BDEC are erasures and the BDSC's transient errors are modeled by the binary
symmetric channel, respectively. Asymptotically, the probability of recovery
failure can converge to zero if the capacity region conditions of nested codes
are satisfied. However, the probability of recovery failure of finite-length
nested codes can be significantly variable for different redundancy allocations
even though they all satisfy the capacity region conditions. Hence, we
formulate the redundancy allocation problem of finite-length nested codes to
minimize the recovery failure probability. We derive the upper bounds on the
probability of recovery failure and use them to estimate the optimal redundancy
allocation. Numerical results show that our estimated redundancy allocation
matches well the optimal redundancy allocation.

correlations and surges in activity---across a range of social, political, and
technological contexts. Yet it remains unclear where these collective behaviors
come from, or if there even exists a set of unifying principles. Indeed,
existing explanations typically rely on context-specific mechanisms, such as
traffic jams driven by work schedules or spikes in online traffic induced by
significant events. However, analogies with statistical mechanics suggest a
more general mechanism: that collective patterns can emerge organically from
fine-scale interactions within a population. Here, across four different modes
of human activity, we show that the simplest correlations in a
population---those between pairs of individuals---can yield accurate
quantitative predictions for the large-scale behavior of the entire population.
To quantify the minimal consequences of pairwise correlations, we employ the
principle of maximum entropy, making our description equivalent to an Ising
model whose interactions and external fields are notably calculated from past
observations of population activity. In addition to providing accurate
quantitative predictions, we show that the topology of learned Ising
interactions resembles the network of inter-human communication within a
population. Together, these results demonstrate that fine-scale correlations
can be used to predict large-scale social behaviors, a perspective that has
critical implications for modeling and resource allocation in human
populations.

functionalized by reactive sites that bind/unbind forming reversible linkages.
Functionalized polymers feature self-assembly and responsive properties that
are unmatched by systems lacking selective interactions. The scales at which
the functional properties of these materials emerge are difficult to model,
especially in the reversible regime where such properties result from many
binding/unbinding events. This difficulty is related to large entropic barriers
associated with the formation of intra-molecular loops. In this work we present
a simulation scheme that sidesteps configurational costs by dedicated Monte
Carlo moves capable of binding/unbinding reactive sites in a single step.
Cross-linking reactions are implemented by trial moves that reconstruct chain
sections attempting, at the same time, a dimerization reaction between pairs of
reactive sites. The model is parametrized by the reaction equilibrium constant
of the reactive species free in solution. This quantity can be obtained by
means of experiments or atomistic/quantum simulations. We use the proposed
methodology to study self-assembly of single--chain polymeric nanoparticles,
starting from flexible precursors carrying regularly or randomly distributed
reactive sites. During a single run, almost all pairs of reactive monomers
interact at least once. We focus on understanding differences in the morphology
of chain nanoparticles when linkages are reversible as compared to the well
studied case of irreversible reactions. Intriguingly, we find that the size of
regularly functionalsized chains, in good solvent conditions, is non-monotonous
as a function of the degree of functionalization. We clarify how this result
follows from excluded volume interactions and is peculiar of reversible
linkages and regular functionalizations.

approach for deep networks designed to augment standard loss functions such as

supervised classification problems where we require the model to represent each

normalization through the hard normalization operation results in a non-convex
formulation. Instead, Ring loss applies soft normalization, where it gradually
learns to constrain the norm to the scaled unit circle while preserving
convexity leading to more robust features. We apply Ring loss to large-scale
face recognition problems and present results on LFW, the challenging protocols
of IJB-A Janus, Janus CS3 (a superset of IJB-A Janus), Celebrity
Frontal-Profile (CFP) and MegaFace with 1 million distractors. Ring loss
outperforms strong baselines, matches state-of-the-art performance on IJB-A

convolutional neural network (CNN) methods to generate a male pelvic sCT using
a T1-weighted MR image. A retrospective study was performed using CTs and
T1-weighted MR images of 20 prostate cancer patients. The proposed 2D CNN
model, which contained 27 convolutional layers, was modified from the SegNet
for better performance. 3D version of the CNN model was also developed. Both
CNN models were trained from scratch to map intensities of T1-weighted MR
images to CT Hounsfield Unit (HU) values. Each sCT was generated in a
five-fold-cross-validation framework and compared with the corresponding CT
using voxel-wise mean absolute error (MAE), and dice similarity coefficient
(DSC), recall, and precision for bony structures. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
were performed to evaluate the differences between the both models. The MAE
averaged across all patients were 40.5 $\pm$ 5.4 HU and 37.6 $\pm$ 5.1 HU for
the 2D and 3D CNN models, respectively. The DSC, recall, and precision of the
bony structures were 0.81 $\pm$ 0.04, 0.85 $\pm$ 0.04, and 0.77 $\pm$ 0.09 for
the 2D CNN model, and 0.82 $\pm$ 0.04, 0.84 $\pm$ 0.04, and 0.80 $\pm$ 0.08 for
the 3D CNN model, respectively. P values of the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were
less than 0.05 except for recall, which was 0.6. The 2D and 3D CNN models
generated accurate pelvic sCTs for the 20 patients using T1-weighted MR images.
The evaluation metrics and statistical tests indicated that the 3D model was
able to generate sCTs with better MAE, bone DSC, and bone precision. The
accuracy of the dose calculation and patient positioning using generated sCTs
will be tested and compared for the two models in the future.

each set of input data (predictor) as well as the output measurements are
represented by tensors. We formulate a linear regression model between the
input and output tensors and estimate the parameters by minimizing a least
square loss function. In order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the number of
parameters to be estimated, we decompose the model parameters using several
bases, spanning the input and output spaces. Next, we learn both the bases and
their spanning coefficients when minimizing the loss function using an
alternating least square (ALS) algorithm. We show that such a minimization has
a closed-form solution in each iteration and can be computed very efficiently.
Through several simulation and case studies, we evaluate the performance of the
proposed method. The results reveal the advantage of the proposed method over

the universality class of the critical phenomenon in URhAl does not belong to
the 3D Ising model (beta = 0.325, gamma = 1.241, and delta = 4.82) with

Kelvin waves. These helical excitations couple vorticity to the quantum fluid
causing long wavelength phonon fluctuations in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This
interaction is hypothesized to be the route to relaxation for turbulent tangles
in quantum hydrodynamics. The local induction approximation is the lowest order
approximation to the Biot-Savart velocity field induced by a vortex line and,
because of its integrability, is thought to prohibit energy transfer by Kelvin
waves. Using the Biot-Savart description, we derive a generalization to the
local induction approximation which predicts that regions of large curvature
can reconfigure themselves as Kelvin wave packets. While this generalization
preserves the arclength metric, a quantity conserved under the Eulerian flow of
vortex lines, it also introduces a non-Hamiltonian structure on the geometric
properties of the vortex line. It is this non-Hamiltonian evolution of
curvature and torsion which provides a resolution to the missing Kelvin wave
motion. In this work, we derive corrections to the local induction
approximation in powers of curvature and state them for utilization in vortex
filament methods. Using the Hasimoto transformation, we arrive at a nonlinear
integro-differential equation which reduces to a modified nonlinear
Schr\""odinger type evolution of the curvature and torsion on the vortex line.
We show that this modification seeks to disperse localized curvature profiles.

specifically for causal inference and for estimating individual as well as
average treatment effects. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1. For
generalized neighbor matching to estimate individual and average treatment
effects, we analyze the use of autoencoders for dimensionality reduction while
maintaining the local neighborhood structure among the data points in the
embedding space. This deep learning based technique is shown to perform better
than simple k nearest neighbor matching for estimating treatment effects,
especially when the data points have several features/covariates but reside in
a low dimensional manifold in high dimensional space. We also observe better
performance than manifold learning methods for neighbor matching. 2. Propensity
score matching is one specific and popular way to perform matching in order to
estimate average and individual treatment effects. We propose the use of deep
neural networks (DNNs) for propensity score matching, and present a network
called PropensityNet for this. This is a generalization of the logistic
regression technique traditionally used to estimate propensity scores and we
show empirically that DNNs perform better than logistic regression at
propensity score matching. Code for both methods will be made available shortly

When illuminated by continuous-wave radiation, the mirror motion will induce
red and blue sideband radiation, which respectively increases and reduces
motional excitation. We find that by suitably driving $\Lambda$-level atoms,
the mirror correlation with a specific radiation sideband could be converted
from the outgoing to the incoming radiation. Such process allows us to
manipulate the heating and cooling effects. Particularly, we develop an
optomechanical cooling strategy that can mutually cancel the heating effect of
the outgoing and incoming radiations, thus the motional ground state is
attainable by net cooling. Without the necessity of cavity installation or
perfect alignment, our proposal complements other efforts in quantum cooling of
macroscopic objects.

provides a powerful architecture for large scale global optimization (LSGO)
problems, but its efficiency relies highly on the decomposition strategy. It
has been shown that differential grouping (DG) performs well on decomposing
LSGO problems by effectively detecting the interaction among decision
variables. However, its decomposition accuracy depends highly on the threshold.
To improve the decomposition accuracy of DG, a global information based
adaptive threshold setting algorithm (GIAT) is proposed in this paper. On the
one hand, by reducing the sensitivity of the indicator in DG to the roundoff
error and the magnitude of contribution weight of subcomponent, we proposed a
new indicator for two variables which is much more sensitive to their
interaction. On the other hand, instead of setting the threshold only based on
one pair of variables, the threshold is generated from the interaction
information for all pair of variables. By conducting the experiments on two
sets of LSGO benchmark functions, the correctness and robustness of this new
indicator and GIAT were verified.

non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) technique for the uplink coordinated
multi-point transmission (CoMP). In the considered scenario, multiple base
stations collaborate with each other to serve a single user, referred to as the
CoMP user, which is the same as for conventional CoMP. However, unlike
conventional CoMP, each base station in N-NOMA opportunistically serves an
extra user, referred to as the NOMA user, while serving the CoMP user at the
same bandwidth. The CoMP user is typically located at the cell-edge, whereas
users close to the base stations are scheduled as NOMA users. Hence, the
channel conditions of the two kind of users are very distinctive, which
facilitates the implementation of NOMA. Compared to the conventional orthogonal
multiple access based CoMP scheme, where multiple base stations serve a single
CoMP user only, the proposed N-NOMA scheme can support larger connectivity by
serving the extra NOMA users, and improve the spectral efficiency by avoiding
the CoMP user solely occupying the spectrum. A stochastic geometry approach is
applied to model the considered N-NOMA scenario as a Poisson cluster process,
based on which closed-form analytical expressions for outage probabilities and
ergodic rates are obtained. Numerical results are presented to show the
accuracy of the analytical results and also demonstrate the superior

faulty or malicious software module from the rest of a system using
instruction-level rewriting. SFI implementations on CISC architectures,
including Google Native Client, use instruction padding to enforce an address
layout invariant and restrict control flow. However this padding decreases code
density and imposes runtime overhead. We analyze this overhead, and show that
it can be reduced by allowing some execution of overlapping instructions, as
long as those overlapping instructions are still safe according to the original
per-instruction policy. We implemented this change for both 32-bit and 64-bit
x86 versions of Native Client, and analyzed why the performance benefit is
higher on 32-bit. The optimization leads to a consistent decrease in the number
of instructions executed and savings averaging 8.6% in execution time (over
compatible benchmarks from SPECint2006) for x86-32. We describe how to modify
the validation algorithm to check the more permissive policy, and extend a
machine-checked Coq proof to confirm that the system's security is preserved.

quickest detection of a deception attack in a scalar linear control system
where the sensor measurements can be replaced by an arbitrary stationary signal
generated by an attacker. By adding a random watermarking signal to the control
action, the controller designs a sequential test based on a Cumulative Sum
(CUSUM) method that accumulates the log-likelihood ratio of the joint
distribution of the residue and the watermarking signal (under attack) and the
joint distribution of the innovations and the watermarking signal under no
attack. As the average detection delay in such tests is asymptotically (as the
false alarm rate goes to zero) upper bounded by a quantity inversely
proportional to the Kullback-Leibler divergence(KLD) measure between the two
joint distributions mentioned above, we analyze the effect of the watermarking
signal variance on the above KLD. We also analyze the increase in the LQG
control cost due to the watermarking signal, and show that there is a tradeoff
between quick detection of attacks and the penalty in the control cost. It is
shown that by considering a sequential detection test based on the joint
distributions of residue/innovations and the watermarking signal, as opposed to
the distributions of the residue/innovations only, we can achieve a higher KLD,
thus resulting in a reduced average detection delay. Numerical results are
provided to support our claims.

the Fisher matrix to calculate the covariance matrix of tensor power spectra

wavenumbers in the vicinity of $k\approx 6\times 10^{-4}$ and $5\times
10^{-3}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which correspond to the ""reionization bump"" at
$\ell\lesssim 6$ and ""recombination bump"" at $\ell\approx 80$ of the CMB B-mode
power spectrum, respectively. The error bar between these two wavenumbers is
larger because of lack of the signal between the reionization and recombination
bumps. The error bars increase sharply towards smaller (larger) wavenumbers
because of the cosmic variance (CMB lensing and instrumental noise). To
demonstrate utility of the reconstructed power spectra we investigate whether
we can distinguish between various sources of tensor modes including those from
the vacuum metric fluctuation and SU(2) gauge fields during single-field
slow-roll inflation, open inflation and massive gravity inflation. The results

relationship between two sentences is a core research problem underlying many
natural language tasks. Depending on whether training data is available, prior
research has proposed both unsupervised distance-based schemes and supervised
deep learning schemes for sentence matching. However, previous approaches
either omit or fail to fully utilize the ordered, hierarchical, and flexible
structures of language objects, as well as the interactions between them. In
this paper, we propose Hierarchical Sentence Factorization---a technique to
factorize a sentence into a hierarchical representation, with the components at
each different scale reordered into a ""predicate-argument"" form. The proposed
sentence factorization technique leads to the invention of: 1) a new
unsupervised distance metric which calculates the semantic distance between a
pair of text snippets by solving a penalized optimal transport problem while
preserving the logical relationship of words in the reordered sentences, and 2)
new multi-scale deep learning models for supervised semantic training, based on
factorized sentence hierarchies. We apply our techniques to text-pair
similarity estimation and text-pair relationship classification tasks, based on
multiple datasets such as STSbenchmark, the Microsoft Research paraphrase
identification (MSRP) dataset, the SICK dataset, etc. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed hierarchical sentence factorization can be used to
significantly improve the performance of existing unsupervised distance-based
metrics as well as multiple supervised deep learning models based on the
convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).

observed in eruption every single year. This unprecedented frequency indicates
an extreme object, with a massive white dwarf and a high accretion rate, which
is the most promising candidate for the single-degenerate progenitor of a
type-Ia supernova known to date. The previous three eruptions of M31N 2008-12a
have displayed remarkably homogeneous multi-wavelength properties: (i) From a
faint peak, the optical light curve declined rapidly by two magnitudes in less
than two days; (ii) Early spectra showed initial high velocities that slowed
down significantly within days and displayed clear He/N lines throughout; (iii)
The supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase of the nova began extremely early, six
days after eruption, and only lasted for about two weeks. In contrast, the
peculiar 2016 eruption was clearly different. Here we report (i) the
considerable delay in the 2016 eruption date, (ii) the significantly shorter
SSS phase, and (iii) the brighter optical peak magnitude (with a hitherto
unobserved cusp shape). Early theoretical models suggest that these three
different effects can be consistently understood as caused by a lower
quiescence mass-accretion rate. The corresponding higher ignition mass caused a
brighter peak in the free-free emission model. The less-massive accretion disk
experienced greater disruption, consequently delaying re-establishment of
effective accretion. Without the early refueling, the SSS phase was shortened.
Observing the next few eruptions will determine whether the properties of the
2016 outburst make it a genuine outlier in the evolution of M31N 2008-12a.

including the mean success probability, the variance of the conditional success
probability, the mean local delay and the asymptotic SIR gains of each tier are

success probability of the whole network and that the b-th moment curve (versus
the SIR threshold) of the conditional success probability of each tier can be
excellently approximated by the horizontal shifted versions of the first moment
curve of the single-tier PPP network. We also provide lower bounds for the
region of the active probabilities of the base stations to keep the mean local

been drawing continuous attention owing to its merits in dealing with
non-Gaussian noise and outliers. However, theoretical understanding of
correntropy, especially in the statistical learning context, is still limited.
In this study, within the statistical learning framework, we investigate
correntropy based regression in the presence of non-Gaussian noise or outliers.
Motivated by the practical way of generating non-Gaussian noise or outliers, we
introduce mixture of symmetric stable noise, which include Gaussian noise,
Cauchy noise, and their mixture as special cases, to model non-Gaussian noise
or outliers. We demonstrate that under the mixture of symmetric stable noise
assumption, correntropy based regression can learn the conditional mean
function or the conditional median function well without resorting to the
finite-variance or even the finite first-order moment condition on the noise.
In particular, for the above two cases, we establish asymptotic optimal
learning rates for correntropy based regression estimators that are
asymptotically of type $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$. These results justify the
effectiveness of the correntropy based regression estimators in dealing with
outliers as well as non-Gaussian noise. We believe that the present study
completes our understanding towards correntropy based regression from a
statistical learning viewpoint, and may also shed some light on robust

an individual network, however usually with linearly-increased cost in both
training and testing. In this work, we propose a two-stage method to learn
Sparse Structured Ensembles (SSEs) for neural networks. In the first stage, we
run SG-MCMC with group sparse priors to draw an ensemble of samples from the
posterior distribution of network parameters. In the second stage, we apply
weight-pruning to each sampled network and then perform retraining over the
remained connections. In this way of learning SSEs with SG-MCMC and pruning, we
not only achieve high prediction accuracy since SG-MCMC enhances exploration of
the model-parameter space, but also reduce memory and computation cost
significantly in both training and testing of NN ensembles. This is thoroughly
evaluated in the experiments of learning SSE ensembles of both FNNs and LSTMs.
For example, in LSTM based language modeling (LM), we obtain 21% relative
reduction in LM perplexity by learning a SSE of 4 large LSTM models, which has
only 30% of model parameters and 70% of computations in total, as compared to
the baseline large LSTM LM. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents
the first methodology and empirical study of integrating SG-MCMC, group sparse
prior and network pruning together for learning NN ensembles.

have shown that a relatively weak magnetic field along the crystallographic
${\bf b}$-axis drives the system from its incommensurate counter-rotating order
to a correlated paramagnet, with a significant uniform `zigzag' component
superimposing the magnetization along the field. Here it is shown that the
zigzag order is not emerging from its linear coupling to the field (via a
staggered, off-diagonal element of the ${\bf g}$-tensor), but from its
intertwining with the incommensurate order and the longitudinal magnetization.
The emerging picture explains all qualitative experimental findings at zero and
finite fields, including the rapid decline of the incommensurate order with
field and the so-called intensity sum rule. The latter are shown to be
independent signatures of the smallness of the Heisenberg exchange $J$,
compared to the Kitaev coupling $K$ and the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma$.
Remarkably, in the regime of interest, the field $H^\ast$ at which the
incommensurate component vanishes, depends essentially only on $J$, which
allows to extract an estimate of $J\!\simeq\!4K$ from reported measurements of
$H^\ast$. We also comment on recent experiments in pressurized
$\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ and conclude that $J$ decreases with pressure.

context of deep neural networks has raised lots of concerns recently. Along
this line, we study a general form of gradient based optimization dynamics with
unbiased noise, which unifies SGD and standard Langevin dynamics. Through
investigating this general optimization dynamics, we analyze the behavior of
SGD on escaping from minima and its regularization effects. A novel indicator
is derived to characterize the efficiency of escaping from minima through
measuring the alignment of noise covariance and the curvature of loss function.
Based on this indicator, two conditions are established to show which type of
noise structure is superior to isotropic noise in term of escaping efficiency.
We further show that the anisotropic noise in SGD satisfies the two conditions,
and thus helps to escape from sharp and poor minima effectively, towards more
stable and flat minima that typically generalize well. We systematically design
various experiments to verify the benefits of the anisotropic noise, compared
with full gradient descent plus isotropic diffusion (i.e. Langevin dynamics).

multi-objective locomotion primitives that can be used for planning. As a
proof-of-concept we consider a simulated hexapod modeled after a recently

short-term memory (ConvLSTM), we propose a temporal single-shot detector (TSSD)

temporally integrating pyramidal feature hierarchy using ConvLSTM, and design a
novel structure including a low-level temporal unit as well as a high-level one
(LH-TU) for multi-scale feature maps. Moreover, we develop a creative temporal
analysis unit, namely, attentional ConvLSTM (AC-LSTM), in which a temporal
attention mechanism is specially tailored for background suppression and scale
suppression while a ConvLSTM integrates attention-aware features across time.
An association loss and a multi-step training are designed for temporal
coherence. Besides, an online tubelet analysis (OTA) is exploited for
identification. Our framework is evaluated on ImageNet VID dataset and 2DMOT15
dataset. Extensive comparisons on the detection and tracking capability
validate the superiority of the proposed approach. Consequently, the developed
TSSD-OTA achieves a fast speed and an overall competitive performance in terms

powering recommender systems for online streaming services with explicit
customer feedback data. CF models do not perform well in scenarios in which
feedback data is not available, in cold start situations like new product
launches, and situations with markedly different customer tiers (e.g., high
frequency customers vs. casual customers). Generative natural language models
that create useful theme-based representations of an underlying corpus of
documents can be used to represent new product descriptions, like new movie
plots. When combined with CF, they have shown to increase the performance in
cold start situations. Outside of those cases though in which explicit customer
feedback is available, recommender engines must rely on binary purchase data,
which materially degrades performance. Fortunately, purchase data can be
combined with product descriptions to generate meaningful representations of
products and customer trajectories in a convenient product space in which
proximity represents similarity. Learning to measure the distance between
points in this space can be accomplished with a deep neural network that trains
on customer histories and on dense vectorizations of product descriptions. We
developed a system based on Collaborative (Deep) Metric Learning (CML) to
predict the purchase probabilities of new theatrical releases. We trained and
evaluated the model using a large dataset of customer histories, and tested the
model for a set of movies that were released outside of the training window.
Initial experiments show gains relative to models that do not train on
collaborative preferences.

quantization is examined from a new perspective, namely sparse least square
optimization. Specifically, inspired by the property of sparse least square
regression, several quantization algorithms based on $l_1$ least square are
proposed. In addition, similar schemes with $l_1 + l_2$ and $l_0$
regularization are proposed. Furthermore, to compute quantization results with
a given amount of values/clusters, this paper designed an iterative method and
a clustering-based method, and both of them are built on sparse least square.
The paper shows that the latter method is mathematically equivalent to an
improved version of k-means clustering-based quantization algorithm, although
the two algorithms originated from different intuitions. The algorithms
proposed were tested with three types of data and their computational
performances, including information loss, time consumption, and the
distribution of the values of the sparse vectors, were compared and analyzed.
The paper offers a new perspective to probe the area of quantization, and the
algorithms proposed can outperform existing methods especially under some
bit-width reduction scenarios, when the required post-quantization resolution
(number of values) is not significantly lower than the original number.

  Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many modern statistical estimation problems are defined by three major
components: a statistical model that postulates the dependence of an output
variable on the input features; a loss function measuring the error between the
observed output and the model predicted output; and a regularizer that controls
the overfitting and/or variable selection in the model. We study the sampling
version of this generic statistical estimation problem where the model
parameters are estimated by empirical risk minimization, which involves the
minimization of the empirical average of the loss function at the data points
weighted by the model regularizer. In our setup we allow all three component
functions discussed above to be of the difference-of-convex (dc) type and
illustrate them with a host of commonly used examples, including those in
continuous piecewise affine regression and in deep learning (where the
activation functions are piecewise affine). We describe a nonmonotone
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for solving the unified nonconvex,
nondifferentiable optimization problem which is formulated as a specially
structured composite dc program of the pointwise max type, and present
convergence results to a directional stationary solution. An efficient
semismooth Newton method is proposed to solve the dual of the MM subproblems.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm and the superiority of continuous piecewise affine

by demultiplexing multi-channel energy-time entanglement generated by a

into the dynamics associated with such data. Such qualitative changes can be
detected through topological approaches, which first embed the data into a
high-dimensional space using a time-delay parameter and subsequently extract
topological features describing the shape of the data from the embedded points.
However, the essential topological features that are extracted using a single
time delay are considered to be insufficient for evaluating the aforementioned
qualitative changes, even when a well-selected time delay is used. We therefore
propose a delay-variant embedding method that constructs the extended
topological features by considering the time delay as a variable parameter
instead of considering it as a single fixed value. This delay-variant embedding
method reveals multiple-time-scale patterns in a time series by allowing the
observation of the variations in topological features, with the time delay
serving as an additional dimension in the topological feature space. We
theoretically prove that the constructed topological features are robust when
the time series is perturbed by noise. Furthermore, we combine these features
with the kernel technique in machine learning algorithms to classify the
general time-series data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for
classifying the synthetic noisy biological and real time-series data. Our
method outperforms a method that is based on a single time delay and,
surprisingly, achieves the highest classification accuracy on an average among

A simple approach is to first construct a dataset without missing values simply
by discarding instances with missing entries or by imputing a fixed value for
each missing entry, and then train a prediction model with the new dataset. A
drawback of this naive approach is that the uncertainty in the missing entries
is not properly incorporated in the prediction. In order to evaluate prediction
uncertainty, the multiple imputation (MI) approach has been studied, but the
performance of MI is sensitive to the choice of the probabilistic model of the
true values in the missing entries, and the computational cost of MI is high
because multiple models must be trained. In this paper, we propose an
alternative approach called the Interval-based Prediction Uncertainty Bounding
(IPUB) method. The IPUB method represents the uncertainties due to missing
entries as intervals, and efficiently computes the lower and upper bounds of
the prediction results when all possible training sets constructed by imputing
arbitrary values in the intervals are considered. The IPUB method can be
applied to a wide class of convex learning algorithms including penalized
least-squares regression, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic
regression. We demonstrate the advantages of the IPUB method by comparing it

measurements remains contentious. We describe recent efforts to better match

theoretical studies on their convergence properties are limited due to the

general methodology for provable convergence guarantees for this type of

involving both two- and three-splitting schemes, we establish the global
convergence to a critical point at a rate of ${\cal O}(1/k)$, where $k$ is the
number of iterations. The results extend to general loss functions which have
Lipschitz continuous gradients and deep residual networks (ResNets). Our key
development adds several new elements to the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality

well as their feedback on the dynamics and thermal profile. We couple the 3D
Met Office Unified Model (UM), including detailed treatments of atmospheric
radiative transfer and dynamics, to a kinetic cloud formation scheme. The
resulting model self--consistently solves for the formation of condensation
seeds, surface growth and evaporation, gravitational settling and advection,
cloud radiative feedback via absorption and, crucially, scattering. Fluxes
directly obtained from the UM are used to produce synthetic SEDs and phase
curves. Our simulations show extensive cloud formation in both planets,
however, cooler temperatures in the HD 189733 b result in higher cloud particle
number densities. Sub-micron particles are suspended by vertical flows leading
to extensive upper-atmosphere cloud cover. A combination of meridional
advection and efficient cloud formation in cooler high latitude regions, result
in enhanced cloud coverage for latitudes > 30 degrees and leads to a zonally
banded structure for all our simulations. The cloud bands extend around the
entire planet(s), as the temperatures, even on the day side, remain below the
condensation temperature of silicates and oxides. Therefore, our simulated
optical phase curve for HD 209458 b shows no `offset', in contrast to
observations. Efficient scattering by cloud results an atmospheric cooling of
up to 250K, and an advection-driven fluctuating cloud opacity causes temporal
variability in the thermal emission. The inclusion of this fundamental
cloud-atmosphere radiative feedback leads to significant differences with
approaches neglecting these physical elements and suggests both a note of
caution of interpretations neglecting such cloud feedback and scattering, and
merits further study.

multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems equipped with low-resolution
digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In previous literature on this topic, it
is commonly assumed that the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly
known. However, in practical applications the CSI is inevitably contaminated by
noise. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an eigen-inference (EI)
precoding scheme to improve the error performance of the coarsely quantized
massive MU-MIMO systems under imperfect CSI, which is mathematically modeled by
a sum of two rectangular random matrices (RRMs). Instead of performing analysis
based on the RRM, using Girko's Hermitization trick, the proposed method
leverages the block random matrix theory by augmenting the RRM into a block
symmetric channel matrix (BSCA). Specially, we derive the empirical
distribution of the eigenvalues of the BSCA and establish the limiting spectra
distribution connection between the true BSCA and its noisy observation. Then,
based on these theoretical results, we propose an EI-based moments matching
method for CSI-related noise level estimation and a rotation invariant
estimation method for CSI reconstruction. Based on the cleaned CSI, the
quantized precoding problem is tackled via the Bussgang theorem and the
Lagrangian multiplier method. The prosed methods are lastly verified by
numerical simulations and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed precoder.

Further, recent methods to NRSfM usually either assume a small number of sparse

cannot reliably model complex non-rigid deformations. To address these issues,
in this paper, we propose a new approach for dense NRSfM by modeling the
problem on a Grassmann manifold. Specifically, we assume the complex non-rigid
deformations lie on a union of local linear subspaces both spatially and
temporally. This naturally allows for a compact representation of the complex
non-rigid deformation over frames. We provide experimental results on several
synthetic and real benchmark datasets. The procured results clearly demonstrate
that our method, apart from being scalable and more accurate than
state-of-the-art methods, is also more robust to noise and generalizes to
highly non-linear deformations.

length is $\lesssim 1$ mm. Conventional displaced-vertex searches are less
sensitive to this sub-millimeter decay range, and thus such metastable
particles have been looked for only in usual prompt decay searches. In this
paper, we show that an additional event-selection cut based on the vertex
reconstruction using charged tracks considerably improves the sensitivity of
ordinary searches which rely only on kinematic selection criteria, for
particles with a decay length of $\gtrsim 100$ $\mu \text{m}$. To that end, we
consider a metastable gluino as an example, and study the impact of this new
event-selection cut on gluino searches at the LHC by simulating both the signal
and Standard Model background processes. Uncertainty of the displaced-vertex
reconstruction due to the limited resolution of track reconstruction is taken
into account. We also discuss possibilities for optimization of the kinematic
selection criteria, which takes advantage of significant reduction of
background through the requirement of displaced vertices. In addition, we
demonstrate that using the method discussed in this paper it is possible to
measure the lifetime of metastable particles with an ${\cal O}(1)$ accuracy at
the high-luminosity LHC. Implications for a future 100 TeV collider are also
studied, where produced particles tend to be more boosted and thus it is easier
to detect the longevity of metastable particles.

HD206267Aa nearly fills its Roche lobe around periastron passage. Whilst the
rotation of the primary of HD206267Aa is in pseudo-synchronization with the
orbital motion, the secondary displays a rotation rate that is higher. The CNO
abundances and properties of HD17505Aa can be explained by single star
evolutionary models accounting for the effects of rotation, suggesting that
this system has not yet experienced binary interaction. The properties of
HD206267Aa suggest that some intermittent binary interaction might have taken
place during periastron passages, but is apparently not operating anymore.

surfaces of a sphere and a plate was measured both before and after the in situ
Ar-ion cleaning. It is shown that this cleaning decreases the magnitude of the

stochastic modelling of moderately dense particle-laden flows, based on a
Lagrangian formalism, which naturally includes the Eulerian one. A rigorous
formalism and a general model have been put forward focusing, in particular, on
the two ingredients that are key in moderately dense flows, namely, two-way
coupling in the carrier phase, and the decomposition of the particle-phase
velocity into its spatially correlated and uncorrelated components.
Specifically, this last contribution allows to identify in the stochastic model
the contributions due to the correlated fluctuating energy and to the granular
temperature of the particle phase, which determines the time scale for
particle-particle collisions. Applications of the Lagrangian
probability-density-function model developed in this work to moderately dense
particle-laden flows are discussed in a companion paper.

fundamentally new and unusual metastable form of amorphous
correlation-localized fermionic matter, which is formed in a new type of

Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) reveals a pseudo-amorphous packing of
localized electrons within the crystal lattice that is significantly denser

states of the system. Remarkably, the arrangement is not random, but displays a
hyperuniform spatial density distribution commonly encountered in classical
jammed systems, showing no signs of aggregation or phase separation.
Unexpectedly for a localized electron system, tunnelling spectroscopy and
multi- STM-tip surface resistance measurements reveal that the overall state is
gapless and conducting, which implies that localized and itinerant carriers are
resonantly entangled. The amorphous localized electron subsystem can be
understood theoretically to arise from strong correlations between polarons
sparsely dispersed on a 2D hexagonal atomic lattice, while itinerant carriers
act as a resonantly coupled reservoir distinct in momentum space.

advertising. Sponsored search (SS) auction, due to the randomness of user query
behavior and platform nature, usually adopts keyword-level bidding strategies.
In contrast, the display advertising (DA), as a relatively simpler scenario for
auction, has taken advantage of real-time bidding (RTB) to boost the
performance for advertisers. In this paper, we consider the RTB problem in
sponsored search auction, named SS-RTB. SS-RTB has a much more complex dynamic
environment, due to stochastic user query behavior and more complex bidding
policies based on multiple keywords of an ad. Most previous methods for DA
cannot be applied. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) solution for
handling the complex dynamic environment. Although some RL methods have been
proposed for online advertising, they all fail to address the ""environment

Motivated by the observation that auction sequences of two days share similar
transition patterns at a proper aggregation level, we formulate a robust MDP
model at hour-aggregation level of the auction data and propose a
control-by-model framework for SS-RTB. Rather than generating bid prices
directly, we decide a bidding model for impressions of each hour and perform
real-time bidding accordingly. We also extend the method to handle the
multi-agent problem. We deployed the SS-RTB system in the e-commerce search

values, the stock prices are used whose correlations have a strong impact on
the loss distribution, particularly on its tails. These correlations are
non-stationary which also influences the tails. We account for the asset
fluctuations by averaging over an ensemble of random matrices that models the
truly existing set of measured correlation matrices. As a most welcome side
effect, this approach drastically reduces the parameter dependence of the loss
distribution, allowing us to obtain very explicit results which show
quantitatively that the heavy tails prevail over diversification benefits even
for small correlations. We calibrate our random matrix model with market data
and show how it is capable of grasping different market situations.
Furthermore, we present numerical simulations for concurrent portfolio risks,

the energy of the field propagates inside the medium. Consequently, they
neglect the transport of mass density by the medium atoms. We have recently
presented foundations of a covariant theory of light propagation in a
nondispersive medium by considering a light wave simultaneously with the
dynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic forces [Phys. Rev. A 95,
063850 (2017)]. In particular, we have shown that the mass is transferred by an
atomic mass density wave (MDW), which gives rise to mass-polariton (MP)
quasiparticles, i.e., covariant coupled states of the field and matter having a
nonzero rest mass. Another key observation of the mass-polariton theory of
light is that, in common semiconductors, most of the momentum of light is
transferred by moving atoms, e.g., 92% in the case of silicon. In this work, we
generalize the MP theory of light for dispersive media and consider
experimental measurement of the mass transferred by the MDW atoms when an
intense light pulse propagates in a silicon fiber. In particular, we consider
optimal intensity and time dependence of a Gaussian pulse and account for the
breakdown threshold irradiance of the material. The optical shock wave property
of the MDW, which propagates with the velocity of light instead of the velocity
of sound, prompts for engineering of novel device concepts like very high
frequency mechanical oscillators not limited by the acoustic cutoff frequency.

captures the phase transition from a metallic phase to a charge density wave

science and learning systems and is becoming of broader interest with the

statistical models and autonomous algorithms that are able to acquire knowledge
from raw data for exploratory analysis, which can be achieved through
clustering techniques or to make predictions of future data via classification
(i.e., discriminant analysis) techniques. Latent data models, including mixture
model-based approaches are one of the most popular and successful approaches in
both the unsupervised context (i.e., clustering) and the supervised one (i.e,
classification or discrimination). Although traditionally tools of multivariate
analysis, they are growing in popularity when considered in the framework of
functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is the data analysis paradigm in which the
individual data units are functions (e.g., curves, surfaces), rather than
simple vectors. In many areas of application, the analyzed data are indeed
often available in the form of discretized values of functions or curves (e.g.,
time series, waveforms) and surfaces (e.g., 2d-images, spatio-temporal data).
This functional aspect of the data adds additional difficulties compared to the
case of a classical multivariate (non-functional) data analysis. We review and
present approaches for model-based clustering and classification of functional
data. We derive well-established statistical models along with efficient
algorithmic tools to address problems regarding the clustering and the
classification of these high-dimensional data, including their heterogeneity,
missing information, and dynamical hidden structure. The presented models and
algorithms are illustrated on real-world functional data analysis problems from

is studied for a dense network of machine-type devices (MTDs) deployed over a
cellular network. In dense machine-to-machine networks, MTDs are typically
located within close proximity and will gather correlated data, and, thus,
clustering MTDs based on data correlation will lead to a decrease in the number
of redundant bits transmitted to the base station. To analyze this clustering
problem, a novel utility function that captures the average MTD transmission
power per cluster is derived, as a function of the MTD location, cluster size,
and inter-cluster interference. Then, the clustering problem is formulated as
an evolutionary game, which models the interactions among the massive number of
MTDs, in order to decrease MTD transmission power. To solve this game, a
distributed algorithm is proposed to allow the infinite number of MTDs to
autonomously form clusters. It is shown that the proposed distributed algorithm
converges to an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), that is robust to a small
portion of MTDs deviating from the stable cluster formation at convergence. The
maximum fraction of MTDs that can deviate from the ESS, while still maintaining
a stable cluster formation is derived. Simulation results show that the
proposed approach can effectively cluster MTDs with highly correlated data,
which, in turn, enables those MTDs to eliminate a large number of redundant
bits. The results show that, on average, using the proposed approach yields
reductions of up to 23.4% and 9.6% in terms of the transmit power per cluster,

reverse-forward bias scans show qualitatively different behaviors regarding the
type of the hysteresis, normal and inverted, depending on the bias pre-poling.
We emphasize here that correlated forward-reverse or reverse-forward bias scans
are essential for a correct assessment of the dynamic hysteresis. In this
context, we define a hysteresis index which consistently assigns the hysteresis
type and magnitude. Our DEM simulations, supported by experimental data,
provide further guidance for an efficient and accurate determination of the
stationary J-V characteristics, showing that the type and magnitude of the
dynamic hysteresis may be affected by unintentional pre-conditioning in typical
experiments.

variationally as a functional of the ensemble density. Like in DFT, the key

applied exact GOK-DFT to the simple but nontrivial Hubbard dimer in order to

  films",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Weyl semimetal WTe2 and MoTe2 show great potential in generating large
spin currents since they possess topologically-protected spin-polarized states
and can carry a very large current density. In addition, the intrinsic
noncentrosymmetry of WTe2 and MoTe2 endows with a unique property of crystal
symmetry-controlled spin-orbit torques. An important question to be answered
for developing spintronic devices is how spins relax in WTe2 and MoTe2. Here,
we report a room-temperature spin relaxation time of 1.2 ns (0.4 ns) in WTe2
(MoTe2) thin film using the time-resolved Kerr rotation (TRKR). Based on ab
initio calculation, we identify a mechanism of long-lived spin polarization
resulting from a large spin splitting around the bottom of the conduction band,
low electron-hole recombination rate and suppression of backscattering required
by time-reversal and lattice symmetry operation. In addition, we find the spin
polarization is firmly pinned along the strong internal out-of-plane magnetic
field induced by large spin splitting. Our work provides an insight into the
physical origin of long-lived spin polarization in Weyl semimetals which could
be useful to manipulate spins for a long time at room temperature.

in the direction of impressed magnetic fields, can contribute to the magnetic
inhibition effect based on the nonhomogeneous magnetic Rayleigh--Taylor (abbr.
NMRT) problem in non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (abbr. MHD) fluids.
Exploiting an infinitesimal method in Lagrangian coordinates, the idea of
(equivalent) magnetic tension, and the differential version of magnetic flux
conservation, we give an explanation of physical mechanism for the magnetic
inhibition phenomenon in a non-resistive MHD fluid. Moreover, we find that the
magnetic energy in the non-resistive MHD fluid depends on the displacement of
fluid particles, and thus can be regarded as elastic potential energy.
Motivated by this observation, we further use the well-known minimum potential
energy principle to explain the physical meaning of the stability/instability
criteria in the NMRT problem. As a result of the analysis, we further extend
the results on the NMRT problem to the stratified MHD fluid case. We point out
that our magnetic inhibition theory can be used to explain the inhibition
phenomenon of other instabilities, such as thermal instability, magnetic
buoyancy instability, and so on, by impressed magnetic fields in non-resistive
MHD fluids.

either the intrinsic dimension of the marginal distribution or the time

expressed as a margin condition. In addition, focusing on the case of bounded

in RF domain and digital beamforming in baseband domain. Phase shifted array is
usually made up with a large amount of phase shifters. Limited to the
manufacturing techniques, phase shifters are unavoidable to have phaseshifting
error and gain error. In the paper we study the influence of imperfect phase
shifters upon the performance of multiuser mmWave massive MIMO systems1 with
the wireless channel modeled by Rice fading. We derive the upper bound of the
achievable sum rate with imperfect phase shifters, which can be very tight when
the number of the antennas at the base station is much larger than the number
of users. Results show that there is a performance ceiling due to
phase-shifting error and gain error. Then we propose a novel channel estimation
and hybrid beamforming method to settle this problem with low training
overhead. It performs well when the channel paths are few and the channel
Rician K-factor is large, which can be easily satisfied in outdoor mmWave
communication environment. We further make a tradeoff between the performance
and the training overhead so that the algorithm can work well in more kinds of
propagation environment.

dense particle-laden turbulent flows, is validated here against
Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical simulation (EL) data for different
homogeneous flows, namely statistically steady and decaying homogeneous
isotropic turbulence, homogeneous-shear flow and cluster-induced turbulence
(CIT). We consider the general model developed in Part I adapted to the
homogeneous case together with a simplified version in which the decomposition
of the phase-averaged (PA) particle-phase fluctuating energy into the spatially
correlated and uncorrelated components is not used, and only total exchange of
kinetic energy between phases is allowed. The simplified model employs the
standard two-way coupling approach. The comparison between EL simulations and
the two stochastic models in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and in
homogeneous-shear flow shows that in all cases both models are capable to
reproduce rather well the flow behaviour, notably for dilute flows. The
analysis of the CIT gives more insights on the physical nature of such systems
and about the quality of the models. Results elucidate the fact that simple
two-way coupling is sufficient to induce turbulence, even though the granular
energy is not considered. Furthermore, first-order moments including velocity
of the fluid seen by particles can be fairly well represented with such a
simplified stochastic model. However, the decomposition into spatially
correlated and uncorrelated components is found to be necessary to account for
anisotropic energy exchanges. When these factors are properly accounted for as
in the complete model, the agreement with the EL statistics is satisfactory up
to second order.

Sub-Galactic Main Sequence (SGMS). By dividing galaxies into two populations
based on their recent mass assembly modes, we find the resolved main sequence
in galaxies with 'outside-in' mode is steeper than that in galaxies with
'inside-out' mode. This is also confirmed on a galaxy-by-galaxy level, where we
find the distributions of SGMS slopes for individual galaxies are clearly
separated for the two populations. When normalizing and stacking the SGMS of
individual galaxies on one panel for the two populations, we find the inner
regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode statistically exhibit a suppression
in star formation, with a less significant trend in the outer regions of

with 'outside-in' mode and the outer regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode
follow a slightly sub-linear scaling relation with a slope $\sim$0.9, which is
in good agreement with previous findings, suggesting that they are experiencing

factors ($\sim$10) enable detailed studies of the $B$-field-induced transition
from a singlet-to-triplet ground state as a function of $t$. In particular, we
investigate how the magnitude of the spin-orbit-induced singlet-triplet
anticrossing depends on $t$. For cases of strong coupling, we find values of
230 $\mu$eV for the anticrossing using excited-state spectroscopy. Experimental
results are reproduced by calculations based on rate equations and a DQD model
including a single orbital in each dot.

gravitational tunneling. Figuratively speaking, this is a quantum transition of
a black hole to a white hole. The physical observables are the characteristic
timescales in which the process takes place.
  After an introduction, we begin with two chapters that review, define and
extend main tools relevant to Lorentzian spinfoams and their semiclassical
limit. We then dedicate a chapter to the classical exterior spacetime, which
provides the setup for the problem. In the last two chapters, we arrive at an
explicit, analytically well-defined and finite expression for a transition
amplitude describing this process and use the semiclassical approximation to
estimate the relevant amplitudes for an arbitrary choice of boundary
conditions. We conclude that the transition is predicted to be allowed by LQG,
with a characteristic duration that is linear in the mass, when the process
takes place. The probability for the process to take place is exponentially
suppressed but non-zero, resulting to a long lifetime.

However, the properties of small-scale events with associated shocks have been
rarely investigated. We present the analyses of a small-scale short-duration
event originating from a small region. The impulsive phase of the M1.9-class
flare lasted only for four minutes. The kinematic evolution of the CME hot
channel reveals some exceptional characteristics including a very short
duration of the main acceleration phase ($<$ 2 minutes), a rather high maximal
acceleration rate ($\sim$50 km s$^{-2}$) and peak velocity ($\sim$1800 km
s$^{-1}$). The fast and impulsive kinematics subsequently results in a
piston-driven shock related to a metric type II radio burst with a high
starting frequency of $\sim$320 MHz of the fundamental band. The type II source
is formed at a low height of below $1.1~\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$ less than $\sim2$
minutes after the onset of the main acceleration phase. Through the band split
of the type II burst, the shock compression ratio decreases from 2.2 to 1.3,
and the magnetic field strength of the shock upstream region decreases from 13
to 0.5 Gauss at heights of 1.1 to 2.3 $~\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$. We find that the
CME ($\sim4\times10^{30}\,\mathrm{erg}$) and flare
($\sim1.6\times10^{30}\,\mathrm{erg}$) consume similar amount of magnetic
energy. The same conclusion for large-scale eruptions implies that small- and
large-scale events possibly share the similar relationship between CMEs and
flares. The kinematic particularities of this event are possibly related to the
small footpoint-separation distance of the associated magnetic flux rope, as
predicted by the Erupting Flux Rope model.

benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that
our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match
accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of
neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied
Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it
performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy
and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not
require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so
constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches. Finally,
we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN to construct 'importance maps' to
detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train.
Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic
spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the
large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems

firstly group the angles of the arrive/departure (AOAs/AODs) of the scattering
paths into several spatial lobes by exploiting the sparseness property of the
millimeter wave in the angular domain, which divides the total angular domain
into effective spatial lobes' coverage angles and ineffective coverage angles.
Then, we map the quantization bits non-uniformly to different coverage angles
and construct NUQ codebooks, where high numbers of quantization bits are
employed for the effective coverage angles to quantize AoAs/AoDs and zero
quantization bit is employed for ineffective coverage angles. Finally, two
low-complexity hybrid analog/digital precoding schemes are proposed based on
NUQ codebooks. Simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed two NUQ
codebook based hybrid precoding schemes achieve near-optimal spectral
efficiencies and show the superiority in reducing the feedback overhead
compared with the uniform quantization (UQ) codebook based works, e.g., at

according to the societal goal, suggesting lock-in. However, despite the
profound implications, we lack a coherent theory of such a process. Here we
propose such a theory, formalized as an agent based model, integrating insights
from complex systems theory, contest theory, behavioral economics and cultural
evolution theory. The model reproduces empirically observed patterns at
multiple levels. It further suggests that any system is likely to converge
towards an equilibrium level of corruption determined by i) the information
captured in the proxy and ii) the strength of an intrinsic incentive towards
the societal goal. Overall, the theory offers mechanistic insight to subjects
as diverse as the scientific reproducibility crisis and the threat of global
warming.

periodic driving to the generation of unconventional topological matter. In
this work, we explore Floquet topological phases of a double kicked rotor with
an extra spin-1/2 degree of freedom. The latter has been experimentally
engineered in a quantum kicked rotor recently by loading Rb87 condensates into
a periodically pulsed optical lattice. Under the on-resonance condition, the

interplay between its external and internal degrees of freedom. Each of these
topological phases is characterized by a pair of winding numbers, whose
combination predicts the number of topologically protected 0 and
\pi-quasienergy edge states in the system. Topological phases with arbitrarily
large winding numbers can be easily found by tuning the kicking strength. We
discuss an experimental proposal to realize this model in kicked Rb87
condensates, and suggest to detect its topological invariants by measuring the

controls the free electron spin relaxation in semiconductors at low

two in $n$-doped GaAs in the metallic phase. The weak localization effect on
the spin relaxation is suppressed by moderate magnetic fields of about 1 T,
which destroy the interference of electron trajectories, and by increasing the
temperature. The weak localization suppression causes an anomalous decrease of
the longitudinal electron spin relaxation time $T_1$ with magnetic field, in
stark contrast with well-known magnetic field induced increase in $T_1$. This
is consistent with transport measurements which show the same variation of
resistivity with magnetic field. Our discovery opens a vast playground to
explore quantum magneto-transport effects optically in the spin dynamics.

propose a novel approach to better leveraging monolingual data for neural
machine translation by jointly learning source-to-target and target-to-source
NMT models for a language pair with a joint EM optimization method. The
training process starts with two initial NMT models pre-trained on parallel
data for each direction, and these two models are iteratively updated by
incrementally decreasing translation losses on training data. In each iteration
step, both NMT models are first used to translate monolingual data from one
language to the other, forming pseudo-training data of the other NMT model.
Then two new NMT models are learnt from parallel data together with the pseudo
training data. Both NMT models are expected to be improved and better
pseudo-training data can be generated in next step. Experiment results on
Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks show that our approach can
simultaneously improve translation quality of source-to-target and
target-to-source models, significantly outperforming strong baseline systems
which are enhanced with monolingual data for model training including
back-translation.

quantum measurement. We analyse a specific class of QRACs, known as the $2^{d}

quantum system. It is known that among rank-1 projective measurements MUBs give
the best performance. We show (for every $d$) that this cannot be improved by
employing non-projective measurements. Moreover, we show that the optimal
performance can only be achieved by measurements which are rank-1 projective
and mutually unbiased. In other words, the $2^{d} \to 1$ QRAC is a self-test

self-testing statement robust we propose measures which characterise how well a
pair of (not necessarily projective) measurements satisfies the MUB conditions
and show how to estimate these measures from the observed performance.
Similarly, we derive explicit bounds on operational quantities like the
incompatibility robustness or the amount of uncertainty generated by the
uncharacterised measurements. For low dimensions the robustness of our bounds
is comparable to that of currently available technology, which makes them

Plus (2019) 134: 318",,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A generalized Brans-Dicke (GBD) theory is proposed and studied in this paper.
The interesting property has been found in the GBD theory, for example it can
naturally solve the problem of \gamma value emerging in f(R) modified gravity
without introducing the so-called chameleon mechanism. In addition, it can be
found that the GBD theory could solve some problems existing in other theories.
(1) The $f(R)$ theory is equivalent to the BD theory with a potential
(abbreviated as BDV) for taking a specific value of the BD parameter \omega=0,
where the specific choice: \omega=0 is quite exceptional, and it is hard to
understand the corresponding absence of the kinetic-energy term for the field.
However, fields in the GBD own the non-disappeared dynamical effect. (2) In the
double scalar-fields quintom model, it is required to include both the
canonical quintessence field and the non-canonical phantom field in order to
make the state parameter to cross over w=-1, while several fundamental problems
are associated with phantom field, such as the problem of negative kinetic term
and the fine-tuning problem, etc. While, in the GBD model, the state parameter
of geometrical dark energy can cross over the phantom boundary as achieved in
the quintom model, without bearing the problems existing in the quintom model.
(3) The GBD theory tends to investigate the physics from the viewpoint of
geometry, while the BDV or the two scalar-fields quintom model tends to solve
physical problems from the viewpoint of matter. It is possible that several
special characteristics of scalar fields could be revealed through studies of
geometrical gravity in the GBD. As an example, we investigate the potential V
of the BD scalar field, and an effective form of V could be given by studying
on the GBD theory. And, it seems that a viable condition for the BD theory
could be found.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1707.01429",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To accommodate structured approaches of neural computation, we propose a
class of recurrent neural networks for indexing and storing sequences of
symbols or analog data vectors. These networks with randomized input weights
and orthogonal recurrent weights implement coding principles previously
described in vector symbolic architectures (VSA), and leverage properties of
reservoir computing. In general, the storage in reservoir computing is lossy
and crosstalk noise limits the retrieval accuracy and information capacity. A
novel theory to optimize memory performance in such networks is presented and
compared with simulation experiments. The theory describes linear readout of
analog data, and readout with winner-take-all error correction of symbolic data
as proposed in VSA models. We find that diverse VSA models from the literature
have universal performance properties, which are superior to what previous
analyses predicted. Further, we propose novel VSA models with the statistically
optimal Wiener filter in the readout that exhibit much higher information
capacity, in particular for storing analog data.
  The presented theory also applies to memory buffers, networks with gradual
forgetting, which can operate on infinite data streams without memory overflow.
Interestingly, we find that different forgetting mechanisms, such as
attenuating recurrent weights or neural nonlinearities, produce very similar
behavior if the forgetting time constants are aligned. Such models exhibit
extensive capacity when their forgetting time constant is optimized for given
noise conditions and network size. These results enable the design of new types
of VSA models for the online processing of data streams.

fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. We
utilise Papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the
singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting system of partial differential
equations is solved using the IAMR code (Incompressible Adaptive Mesh
Refinement), which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective
terms and semi-implicit diffusion in the context of an approximate projection
method to solve on adaptively refined meshes. By augmenting the IAMR code with

power-law fluids in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we
expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers which have been considered in

data, i.e., individual-level data remains at many different sites, but analysis
nevertheless has to be performed jointly. The corresponding aggregated data is
often exchanged manually, requiring explicit permission before transfer, i.e.,
the number of data calls and the amount of data should be limited. Thus, only
simple aggregated summary statistics are typically transferred with just a
single call. This does not allow for more complex tasks such as variable
selection. As an alternative, we propose a multivariable regression approach
for identifying important markers by automatic variable selection based on
aggregated data from different locations in iterative calls. To minimize the
amount of transferred data and the number of calls, we also provide a heuristic
variant of the approach. When performing a global data standardization, the
proposed methods yields the same results as when pooling individual-level data.
In a simulation study, the information loss introduced by a local
standardization is seen to be minimal. In a typical scenario, the heuristic
decreases the number of data calls from more than 10 to 3, rendering manual

difference between the rigidity spectral indices of protons and helium ions.
This finding is a notable contrast to the commonly accepted theoretical
prediction that supernova remnant (SNR) shocks accelerate protons and helium
ions with the same rigidity alike. Most of the earlier explanations for the
""paradox"" appealed to SNR environmental factors, such as inhomogeneous $p$/He
mixes in the shock upstream medium, variable ionization states of He, or a
multi-SNR origin of the observed spectra. The newest observations, however, are
in tension with most of them. In this paper, we show by self-consistent hybrid
simulations that such special conditions are not vital for the explanation of
the cosmic ray rigidity spectra. In particular, our simulations prove that an
SNR shock can modify the chemical composition of accelerated cosmic rays by
preferentially extracting them from a homogeneous background plasma without
additional, largely untestable assumptions. Our results confirm the earlier
theoretical predictions of how the efficiency of injection depends on the shock
Mach number $M.$ Its increase with the charge-to-mass ratio saturates at a
level that grows with $M.$ We have convolved the time-dependent injection rates
of protons and helium ions, obtained from the simulations, with a decreasing
shock strength over the active life of SNRs. The integrated SNR rigidity
spectrum for $p$/He ratio compares well with the AMS-02 and PAMELA data.

of quarks, specially strange quarks, adopting the Krori-Barua

of state (EOS) of a strange star can be represented by the MIT bag model as
$p_r(r)=\frac{1}{3}[\rho(r)-4B_g]$ where $B_g$ is the bag constant, arises due
to the quark pressure. Main motive behind our study is to find out singularity
free and physically acceptable solutions for different features of strange
stars. Here we also investigate the effect of alternative gravity in the
formation of strange stars. We find that our model is consistent with various
energy conditions and also satisfies Herrera's cracking condition, TOV
equation, static stability criteria of Harrison-Zel$'$dovich-Novikov etc. The
value of the adiabatic indices as well as the EOS parameters re-establish the
acceptability of our model. Here in detail we have studied specifically three
different strange star candidates, viz. $PSRJ~1614~2230, Vela~X-1$ and
$Cen~X-3$. As a whole, present model fulfils all the criteria for stability.
Another fascinating point we have discussed is the value of the bag constant
which lies in the range $(40-45)$~MeV/fm$^{3}$. This is quite smaller than the
predicted range, i.e., $(55-75)$~MeV/fm$^{3}$ ~\cite{Farhi1984,Alcock1986}. The
presence of the constant ($\chi$), arises due to the coupling between matter

sophisticated inference frameworks that relax the original modeling assumption
of observing an agent behavior that reflects only a single intention. Instead
of learning a global behavioral model, recent IRL methods divide the
demonstration data into parts, to account for the fact that different
trajectories may correspond to different intentions, e.g., because they were
generated by different domain experts. In this work, we go one step further:
using the intuitive concept of subgoals, we build upon the premise that even a
single trajectory can be explained more efficiently locally within a certain
context than globally, enabling a more compact representation of the observed
behavior. Based on this assumption, we build an implicit intentional model of
the agent's goals to forecast its behavior in unobserved situations. The result
is an integrated Bayesian prediction framework that significantly outperforms
existing IRL solutions and provides smooth policy estimates consistent with the
expert's plan. Most notably, our framework naturally handles situations where
the intentions of the agent change over time and classical IRL algorithms fail.
In addition, due to its probabilistic nature, the model can be
straightforwardly applied in active learning scenarios to guide the
demonstration process of the expert.

investigated how a single spiking neuron can optimally respond to one given
pattern (localist coding), or to either one of several patterns (distributed
coding, i.e. the neuron's response is ambiguous but the identity of the pattern
could be inferred from the response of multiple neurons), but not to random
inputs. To do so, we extended a theory developed in a previous paper
[Masquelier, 2017], which was limited to localist coding. More specifically, we
computed analytically the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a
multi-pattern-detector neuron, using a threshold-free leaky integrate-and-fire
(LIF) neuron model with non-plastic unitary synapses and homogeneous Poisson
inputs. Surprisingly, when increasing the number of patterns, the SNR decreases
slowly, and remains acceptable for several tens of independent patterns.
  In addition, we investigated whether spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
could enable a neuron to reach the theoretical optimal SNR. To this aim, we
simulated a LIF equipped with STDP, and repeatedly exposed it to multiple input
spike patterns, embedded in equally dense Poisson spike trains. The LIF
progressively became selective to every repeating pattern with no supervision,
and stopped discharging during the Poisson spike trains. Furthermore, using
certain STDP parameters, the resulting pattern detectors were optimal. Tens of
independent patterns could be learned by a single neuron using a low adaptive
threshold, in contrast with previous studies, in which higher thresholds led to
localist coding only.
  Taken together these results suggest that coincidence detection and STDP are
powerful mechanisms, fully compatible with distributed coding. Yet we
acknowledge that our theory is limited to single neurons, and thus also applies
to feed-forward networks, but not to recurrent ones.

$R_\omega$, and a scale height temperature, $T$. These results can be combined
into coronal density and temperature profiles. We derived radial intensity
profiles from the radio images. We focus on polar directions with simpler,
radial magnetic field structure. Intensity profiles were modeled by ray-tracing
simulations, following wave paths through the refractive solar corona, and
including free-free emission and absorption. We fitted model profiles to
observations with $R_\omega$ and $T$ as fitting parameters. In the low corona,
$R_\omega < 1.5$ solar radii, we find high scale height temperatures up to
2.2e6 K, much more than the brightness temperatures usually found there. But if
all $R_\omega$ values are combined into a density profile, this profile can be
fitted by a hydrostatic model with the same temperature, thereby confirming
this with two independent methods. The density profile deviates from the
hydrostatic model above 1.5 solar radii, indicating the transition into the
solar wind. These results demonstrate what information can be gleaned from
solar low-frequency radio images. The scale height temperatures we find are not
only higher than brightness temperatures, but also than temperatures derived
from coronograph or EUV data. Future observations will provide continuous
frequency coverage, eliminating the need for local hydrostatic density models.

at different locations in the image; 2) a classifier that scores the different
pose proposals; and 3) a regressor that refines pose proposals both in 2D and
3D. All three stages share the convolutional feature layers and are trained
jointly. The final pose estimation is obtained by integrating over neighboring
pose hypotheses, which is shown to improve over a standard non maximum
suppression algorithm. Our method recovers full-body 2D and 3D poses,
hallucinating plausible body parts when the persons are partially occluded or
truncated by the image boundary. Our approach significantly outperforms the
state of the art in 3D pose estimation on Human3.6M, a controlled environment.
Moreover, it shows promising results on real images for both single and
multi-person subsets of the MPII 2D pose benchmark and demonstrates satisfying
3D pose results even for multi-person images.

roughness (friction) of the underlying topography. For this reason, mechanisms
to mitigate floods frequently employ structural measures that either modify
topographic elevation, e.g., through the placement of levees and sandbags, or
increase roughness, e.g., through revegetation projects. However, the
configuration of these measures is typically decided in an ad hoc manner,
limiting their overall effectiveness. The advent of high-performance surface
water modeling software and improvements in black-box optimization suggest that
a more principled design methodology may be possible. This paper proposes a new
computational approach to the problem of designing structural mitigation
strategies under physical and budgetary constraints. It presents the
development of a problem discretization amenable to simulation-based,
derivative-free optimization. However, meta-heuristics alone are found to be
insufficient for obtaining quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. As
a result, this paper proposes novel numerical and physics-based procedures to
improve convergence to a high-quality mitigation. The efficiency of the
approach is demonstrated on hypothetical dam break scenarios of varying
complexity under various mitigation budget constraints. In particular,
experimental results show that, on average, the final proposed algorithm
results in a 65% improvement in solution quality compared to a direct

particular, we are concerned with abnormal cohort effects such as those for
generations 1919 and 1920, for which the period tables provided by the Human
Mortality Database show particularly low and high mortality rates respectively.
To provide corrected tables for the three countries of interest here (France,
Italy and West Germany), we use the approach developed by Boumezoued (2016) for
countries for which the method applies (France and Italy), and provide an
extension of the method for West Germany as monthly fertility histories are not
sufficient to cover the generations of interest. These mortality tables are
crucial inputs to stochastic mortality models forecasting future scenarios,
from which the extreme 0,5% longevity improvement can be extracted, allowing
for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). More precisely,
to assess the impact of such anomalies in the Solvency II framework, we use a
simplified internal model based on three usual stochastic models to project
mortality rates in the future combined with a closure table methodology for
older ages. Correcting this bias obviously improves the data quality of the
mortality inputs, which is of paramount importance today, and slightly
decreases the capital requirement. Overall, the longevity risk assessment
remains stable, as well as the selection of the stochastic mortality model. As
a collateral gain of this data quality improvement, the more regular estimated
parameters allow for new insights and a refined assessment regarding longevity
risk.

as a spin $0$, real scalar field that couples to the fermion field. Any value
for the mass of $\vec{A}$ is possible. The lack of direct experimental evidence
for the presence of the $g$ or $\alpha$ field means that the field must be
essentially constant within a local region of the cosmological universe.
Outside the local region there are no restrictions on the field. Possible
physical candidates, (inflaton, dark matter, dark energy) for $\alpha$ are
noted.

Different from previous methods using concatenation or weighted average

Fields (CRFs). In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on
a cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By
designing a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs,
we show that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks
and that training can be performed end-to-end. Through an extensive
experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

large scale optimization problems (LSOPs) through a divide-and-conquer
strategy. However, its performance is severely restricted by the current
context-vector-based sub-solution evaluation method since this method needs to
access the original high dimensional simulation model when evaluating each
sub-solution and thus requires many computation resources. To alleviate this
issue, this study proposes an adaptive surrogate model assisted CC framework.
This framework adaptively constructs surrogate models for different
sub-problems by fully considering their characteristics. For the single
dimensional sub-problems obtained through decomposition, accurate enough
surrogate models can be obtained and used to find out the optimal solutions of
the corresponding sub-problems directly. As for the nonseparable sub-problems,
the surrogate models are employed to evaluate the corresponding sub-solutions,
and the original simulation model is only adopted to reevaluate some good
sub-solutions selected by surrogate models. By these means, the computation
cost could be greatly reduced without significantly sacrificing evaluation
quality. Empirical studies on IEEE CEC 2010 benchmark functions show that the
concrete algorithm based on this framework is able to find much better
solutions than the conventional CC algorithms and a non-CC algorithm even with
much fewer computation resources.

g such that their corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps at a fixed frequency

counterexamples to uniqueness in dimension n $\ge$ 3 to the anisotropic

in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, due to the large-scale nature of
the system and its susceptibility to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping
attacks. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic
authentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning
framework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT
devices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated
signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method
enables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively
authenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT
scenarios, since the cloud cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due
to computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve
the cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The
mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the
uniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive
IoT system, due to a large set of available actions for the cloud, it is shown
that analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging and, thus, a learning
algorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with
the incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of
the unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed
to dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud
to decide on which IoTDs to authenticate. Simulation results show that, with an
attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from
IoT devices with an almost 100% reliability.

State-of-the-art approaches model house prices as a combination of a latent
land desirability surface and a regression from house features. However, by
using uniformly damping kernels, they are unable to handle irregularly shaped
regions or capture land value discontinuities within the same region due to the
existence of implicit sub-communities, which are common in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we explore the novel application of recent advances
in spatial functional analysis to house price modeling and propose the
Hierarchical Spatial Functional Model (HSFM), which decomposes house values

based on finite-element spatial functional analysis and spatial constrained
clustering to train our model. Extensive evaluations based on housing data in a
major Canadian city show that our proposed approach can reduce the mean

setting. More precisely, we show that the trace distance between two quantum
states can not be determined by their earth mover's distance. The technique
here is to track the bipartite quantum marginal problem. Then we provide
inequality to describe the structure of quantum coupling, which can be regarded
as quantum generalization of Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem. After that, we
generalize it to obtain into the tripartite version, and build a new class of
necessary criteria for the tripartite marginal problem.

exploration over large search spaces. In this paper, we propose an efficient
methodology for design space exploration. We evaluate our methodology over two
search spaces - small and large, using a cycle-accurate simulator (ESESC) and a
standard set of PARSEC and SPLASH-2 benchmarks. For the smaller design space,
we compare results obtained from our design space exploration methodology with
results obtained from fully exhaustive search. The results show that solution
quality obtained from our methodology are within 1.35% - 3.69% of the results
obtained from fully exhaustive search while only exploring 2.74% - 3% of the
design space. For larger design space, we compare solution quality of different
results obtained by varying the number of tunable processor design parameters
included in the exhaustive search phase of our methodology. The results show
that including more number of tunable parameters in the exhaustive search phase
of our methodology greatly improves solution quality.

enhanced discriminative abilities. It has been proved that the consideration of
multi-scale local neighborhood improves the performance of the descriptor,
though at the cost of increased dimension. This paper proposes a novel method
to construct a local descriptor using multi-scale neighborhood by finding the
local directional order among the intensity values at different scales in a
particular direction. Local directional order is the multi-radius relationship
factor in a particular direction. The proposed local directional order pattern
(LDOP) for a particular pixel is computed by finding the relationship between
the center pixel and local directional order indexes. It is required to
transform the center value into the range of neighboring orders. Finally, the
histogram of LDOP is computed over whole image to construct the descriptor. In
contrast to the state-of-the-art descriptors, the dimension of the proposed
descriptor does not depend upon the number of neighbors involved to compute the
order; it only depends upon the number of directions. The introduced descriptor
is evaluated over the image retrieval framework and compared with the
state-of-the-art descriptors over challenging face databases such as PaSC, LFW,
PubFig, FERET, AR, AT&T, and ExtendedYale. The experimental results confirm the
superiority and robustness of the LDOP descriptor.

are applied to the stochastic model of a passively advected vector field. The
advecting velocity field is generated by the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation
with compressibility taken into account. The model is considered in the
vicinity of space dimension $d=4$ and the perturbation theory is constructed
within a double expansion scheme in $y$ and $\epsilon=4-d$, where $y$ describes
scaling behaviour of the random force that enters a stochastic equation for the
velocity field. We show that the correlation functions of the passive vector
field in the inertial range exhibit anomalous scaling behaviour. The critical
dimensions of tensor composite operators of passive vector field are calculated
in the leading order of $y$,$\epsilon$ expansion.

state can be typically provided through well-known canonical average. The
average includes tremendous number of possible states considered far beyond
practically handled, which makes it difficult to obtain analytic representation
of the average to clarify how the expectation value connects with given
interaction: i.e., the relationship is generally understood in phonomenological
manner except for modest, simple models. Here we show that the relationship is
explicitly clarified for discrete large systems, where the configurational
density of states for any single pair correlation is represented in terms of
linear combination of Dirac delta function and its derivatives. The significant
advantage of the present representation is that it can decompose contributions
to macroscopic dynamical variables into harmonicity and anharmonicity in terms
of their underlying structural degree of freedom, which will lead to find a set
of special microscopic state to characterize macroscopic properties in
equilibrium state for classical many-body systems.
