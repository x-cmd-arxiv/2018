derive a new generalization bound for the truncated inverse propensity score
estimator. We apply the bound to a class of Bayesian policies, which motivates
a novel, potentially data-dependent, regularization technique for CRM.
Experimental results indicate that this technique outperforms standard $L_2$

being both simpler to implement and more computationally efficient.

equivalent to shortening scanning time by a factor of 2 or more at high number

subsets low one can significantly reduce image noise, which in turn is
equivalent to increasing scanning time or radiation dose. While the OSEM
remains a very useful reconstruction method enabling substantial reduction of
reconstruction times, it should be used with caution. In particular, high
numbers of subsets should be avoided if possible. Whenever the available
computing power allows achieving acceptable reconstruction times at lower

binary is a long standing problem in high energy Astrophysics. We review the
magnetospheric radius calculations in the so-called magnetically threaded disk
model, comparing the simplified approach originally proposed by Ghosh & Lamb
(1979) with the revised version proposed by Wang (1987), Wang (1995), and Wang
(1997). We show that for a given set of fixed parameters (assuming also a
comparable screening factor of the neutron star magnetic field by the currents
induced on the disk surface) the revised magnetically threaded disk model
predicts a magnetospheric radius that is significantly smaller than that
derived from the Ghosh & Lamb (1979) treatment. For a fixed value of the
neutron star magnetic field and a wide range of mass accretion rates, the
inclusion of a large inclination angle between the neutron star rotation and
magnetic field axes ($\chi$$\gtrsim$60 deg) leads to a further decrease of the
magnetospheric radius. To illustrate the relevance of these calculations, we
consider, as an example, the case of the transitional pulsars. During the
so-called ""high mode"" of their sub-luminous accretion disk state, these sources
have shown X-ray pulsations interpreted as due to accretion at an unprecedented
low luminosity level compared to other neutron stars in X-ray binaries. In the
context of the magnetic threaded disk model, we show that accretion at
luminosities of $\sim$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (and thus accretion-driven X-ray
pulsations) can be more easily explained when the prescription of the
magnetospheric radius provided by Wang (1997) is used. This avoids the need of
invoking very strong propeller outflows in the transitional pulsars, as
proposed in other literature works.

electronics. The ability to control their chemical, optical, or electronic
features by controlling their size and shape explains why these materials are
so widely employed. Nevertheless, altering some of these properties may also
lead to some undesired side effects, one of which is an increase in optical
scattering upon concentration. Here, we address this strong scattering issue in
films made of colloids with high surface roughness. We focus on raspberry type
polymeric particles made of a spherical polystyrene core decorated by small
hemispherical domains of acrylate. Owing to their surface charge and model
roughness, aqueous dispersions of these particles display an unusual stability
against aggregation. Under certain angles, their solid films display a
brilliant red color due to Bragg scattering but otherwise appear completely
white on account of`strong scattering. To suppress the scattering and induce
transparency, we prepared films by hybridizing them either with
oppositely-charged PS-particles that fit the length-scale of the raspberry
roughness or with quantum dots. We report that the smaller PS-particles prevent
raspberry particle aggregation in solid films and suppress scattering by
decreasing the spatial variation of the refractive index. We believe that the
results presented here provide a simple strategy to suppress strong scattering
of rough particles and allow for their utilization in optical coatings,
cosmetics, or photonics.

Darji's question asking whether these two notions are the same. Even though
there have been several partial results suggesting a positive answer, in this
paper we construct a counterexample. More specifically, we construct a
$G_\delta$ set in $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$ that is Haar meager but not strongly Haar
meager. We also show that no $F_\sigma$ counterexample exists, hence our result

looser form of immunity that models the ability to spread without resistance.
Monte Carlo simulations reveal lower synergy makes contagions more susceptible
to percolation, especially those that diffuse on lattices. Faster diffusion of
one contagion with dormancy probabilistically blocks the diffusion of the
other, in a way similar to ring vaccination. We show that within a band of
synergy, contagions on the lattices undergo bimodal or trimodal branching if
they are the slower diffusing contagion.

related to over- currents and voltages occurred under large disturbances (e.g.
a grid fault). Previous analysis in evaluating these transients usually neglect
the nonlinear control effects of a VSC (e.g. phase-locked-loop, PLL).
Therefore, potential stability issues related with nonlinear dynamics cannot be
revealed properly. This work aims to move further in this respect. To better
analyze and gain more insights into the nonlinear properties, dynamical
analysis of a grid-tied VSC is conducted by parts. Specifically, the nonlinear
behaviors of VSC power control loop (PCL) are firstly analyzed, in which the
dynamics of PLL are assumed steady. Then, the nonlinear behaviors of
PLL-dominant dynamics are further explored in detail, where the PCL is assumed
steady. In this case, frequency instability and the mechanisms behind it are
revealed. At last, effects of PQ controller regulation as well as controller
bandwidth on the frequency stability are discussed. All the analysis and
conclusions are verified by time domain simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC, where a
switching model of VSC is adopted.

including two irregulars, two dwarf starbursts, two spirals, and two mergers.
The average value for our sample is Gamma_F ~ 24 +/- 9%. We also calculate the
fraction of stars in clusters that survive to ages between t1 and t2, denoted
by Gamma_S(t1,t2), and find Gamma_S(10,100)=4.6 +/- 2.5% and
Gamma_S(100,400)=2.4 +/- 1.1 %, significantly lower than Gamma_F for the same
galaxies. We do not find any systematic trends in Gamma_F or Gamma_S with the
star formation rate (SFR), the SFR per unit area (Sigma_SFR), or the surface
density of molecular gas (Sigma_H2) within the host galaxy. Our results are
consistent with those found previously from the CMF/SFR statistic (where CMF is
the cluster mass function), and with the quasi-universal model in which
clusters in different galaxies form and disrupt in similar ways. Our results,
however, contradict many previous claims that the fraction of stars in bound
clusters increases strongly with Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H_2. We find that the
previously reported trends are largely driven by comparisons that mixed Gamma_F
~ Gamma_S(0,10) and Gamma_S(10,100), where Gamma_S(0,10) was systematically
used for galaxies with higher Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2, and Gamma_S(10,100) for

related young bright stars, trace the typical regions of recent star formation
in galaxies. Their morphologies vary from small associations of stars to
enormous stellar complexes. Being associated with star-forming regions of
various sizes, they trace the regions where stars form at various scales, from
compact clusters to whole galactic disks. They have been, thus, the focus of
several studies with special interest on their demographics, classification,
and structural morphology. Their surveys demonstrate that the clear distinction
of these systems into well-defined classes is not straightforward, due to their
low densities, asymmetric shapes and variety in structural parameters. Unbound
stellar structures follow a hierarchical clustering pattern up to the scale of
a whole star-forming galaxy. This structural pattern, which is usually
characterized as self-similar or fractal, appears to be identical to that of
star-forming giant molecular clouds and interstellar gas, driven mainly by
turbulence cascade. In this short review, I make a concise compilation of our
understanding of unbound young stellar systems across various environments in
the local universe, as it is developed during the last 60 years. I present a
factual assessment of the clustering behavior of star formation, as revealed
from the assembling pattern of stars across loose stellar structures and its
relation to the interstellar medium and the environmental conditions. I also
provide a consistent account of the processes that possibly play important role
in the formation of unbound stellar systems, compiled from both theoretical and

(2013) pioneered a way to practically compute
approximations to large scale counting or discrete integration problems by
using random hashes. The hashes are used to reduce the counting problem into
many separate discrete optimization problems. The optimization problems then
can be solved by an NP-oracle such as commercial SAT solvers or integer linear
programming (ILP) solvers. In particular, Ermon et al. showed that if the
domain of integration is $\{0,1\}^n$ then it is possible to obtain a solution
within a factor of $16$ of the optimal (a 16-approximation) by this technique.
  In many crucial counting tasks, such as computation of partition function of
ferromagnetic Potts model, the domain of integration is naturally $\{0,1,\dots,
q-1\}^n, q>2$, the hypergrid. The straightforward extension of Ermon et al.'s
method allows a $q^2$-approximation for this problem. For large values of $q$,
this is undesirable. In this paper, we show an improved technique to obtain an
approximation factor of $4+O(1/q^2)$ to this problem. We are able to achieve
this by using an idea of optimization over multiple bins of the hash functions,
that can be easily implemented by inequality constraints, or even in
unconstrained way. Also the burden on the NP-oracle is not increased by our
method (an ILP solver can still be used). We provide experimental simulation

true reflection of the data generating mechanism. This assumption is
problematic, particularly in complex data environments. Here we present a
Bayesian nonparametric approach to learning that makes use of statistical
models, but does not assume that the model is true. Our approach has provably
better properties than using a parametric model and admits a Monte Carlo
sampling scheme that can afford massive scalability on modern computer
architectures. The model-based aspect of learning is particularly attractive
for regularizing nonparametric inference when the sample size is small, and
also for correcting approximate approaches such as variational Bayes (VB). We
demonstrate the approach on a number of examples including VB classifiers and
Bayesian random forests.

centred planar Gaussian fields exhibits a phase transition at the zero level
that is analogous to the phase transition in Bernoulli percolation. In addition
to symmetry, positivity and regularity conditions, we assume only that
correlations decay polynomially with exponent larger than two -- roughly
equivalent to the integrability of the covariance kernel -- whereas previously
the phase transition was only known in the case of the Bargmann-Fock covariance
kernel which decays super-exponentially. We also prove that the phase
transition is sharp, demonstrating, without any further assumption on the decay
of correlations, that in the sub-critical regime crossing probabilities decay
exponentially.
  Key to our methods is the white-noise representation of a Gaussian field; we
use this on the one hand to prove new quasi-independence results, inspired by
the notion of influence from Boolean functions, and on the other hand to
establish sharp thresholds via the OSSS inequality for i.i.d. random variables,
following the recent approach of Duminil-Copin, Raoufi and Tassion.

Assuming this age is representative for the bulk of bulge stars, we then recall
the observed properties of star-forming galaxies at 10 Gyr lookback time, i.e.,

GHZ states over arbitrary distances, with a constant overhead per node/channel
that is independent of the distance. The approach is genuine multipartite, and
is based on the measurement-based implementation of multipartite hashing, an
entanglement purification protocol that operates on a large ensemble together
with local merging/connection of elementary building blocks. We analyze the
performance of the scheme in a setting where local or global storage is
limited, and compare it to bipartite and hybrid approaches that are based on
the distribution of entangled pairs. We find that the multipartite approach
offers a storage advantage, which results in higher efficiency and better
performance in certain parameter regimes. We generalize our approach to

b, which was first identified on May 2015 in the course of the SHINE survey

obtained new deep SPHERE/IRDIS imaging and SPHERE/IFS spectroscopic
observations of PDS 70 b. The astrometric baseline now covers 6 years which
allows us to perform an orbital analysis. For the first time, we present
spectrophotometry of the young planet which covers almost the entire
near-infrared range (0.96 to 3.8 micrometer). We use different atmospheric
models covering a large parameter space in temperature, log(g), chemical
composition, and cloud properties to characterize the properties of the
atmosphere of PDS 70 b. Results: PDS 70 b is most likely orbiting the star on a
circular and disk coplanar orbit at ~22 au inside the gap of the disk. We find
a range of models that can describe the spectrophotometric data reasonably well
in the temperature range between 1000-1600 K and log(g) no larger than 3.5 dex.
The planet radius covers a relatively large range between 1.4 and 3.7 R_jupiter
with the larger radii being higher than expected from planet evolution models
for the age of the planet of 5.4 Myr. Conclusions: This study provides a
comprehensive dataset on the orbital motion of PDS 70 b, indicating a circular
orbit and a motion coplanar with the disk. The first detailed spectral energy
distribution of PDS 70 b indicates a temperature typical for young giant
planets. The detailed atmospheric analysis indicates that a circumplanetary
disk may contribute to the total planet flux.

and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few
detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are
currently suspected to be disk features. In this context, the transition disk
around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap
identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We
aim to search for the presence of planets and search for disk structures
indicative for disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary processes. We
analyse new and archival near-infrared (NIR) images of the transition disk PDS
70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo and Gemini/NICI instruments in
polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) and angular differential imaging (ADI)
modes. We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas
(about 22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five
different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The
astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The
comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks
suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. We confirm the
detection of a large gap of about 54 au in size within the disk in our
scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We
find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than about 17 au in radius.
The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness
distribution which may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very
small grains. Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and
continuing astrometry will allow us to test theoretical predictions regarding
planet-disk interactions, planetary atmospheres and evolutionary models.

Way bulge is widely accepted as evidence for an X-shaped structure originated
from the bar instability. A drastically different interpretation has been
suggested, however, based on the He-enhanced multiple stellar population
phenomenon as is observed in globular clusters (GCs). Because these two
scenarios imply very different pictures on the formation of the bulge and
elliptical galaxies, understanding the origin of the double RC is of crucial
importance. Here we report our discovery that the stars in the two RCs show a
significant (> 5.3 {\sigma}) difference in CN-band strength, in stark contrast
to that expected in the X-shaped bulge scenario. The difference in CN abundance
and the population ratio between the two RCs are comparable to those observed
in GCs between the first- and later generation stars. Since CN-strong stars
trace a population with enhanced N, Na, and He abundances originated in GCs,
this is direct evidence that the double RC is due to the multiple population
phenomenon, and that a significant population of stars in the Milky Way bulge
were assembled from disrupted proto-GCs. Our result also calls for the major
revision of the 3D structure of the Milky Way bulge given that the current view
is based on the previous interpretation of the double RC phenomenon.

crystal imperfections are difficult to avoid, and their consequences are
incompletely understood. Here we study magnetic impurities in Kondo insulators
via perturbation theory of the s-d Kondo impurity model adapted to small
bandgap insulators. The calculated magnetization and specific heat agree with
recent thermodynamic measurements in samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$). This
qualitative agreement supports the physical picture of multi-channel Kondo
screening of local moments by electrons and holes involving both intrinsic and
impurity bands. Specific heat is thermally activated in zero field by Kondo
screening through sub-gap impurity bands and exhibits a characteristic upturn
as the temperature is decreased. In contrast, magnetization obtains a dominant
quantum correction from partial screening by virtual particle-hole pairs in
intrinsic bands. We point out that magnetic impurities could impact de Haas-van
Alphen quantum oscillations in SmB$_6$, through the effects of Landau
quantization in intrinsic bands on the Kondo screening of impurity moments.

scale structure of the Universe at high redshifts, $z\gtrsim 2$. However, their
detection is sensitive to radiative transfer effects that depend on local
astrophysical conditions. Thus, modeling the bulk properties of this galaxy
population remains challenging for theoretical models. Here we develop a
physically-motivated scheme to predict LAEs in cosmological simulations. The
escape of Ly{\alpha} photons is computed using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code which outputs a Ly{\alpha} escape fraction. To speed-up the process of
assigning escape fractions to individual galaxies, we employ fitting formulae
that approximate the full Monte Carlo results within an accuracy of 10% for a
broad range of column densities, gas metallicities and gas bulk velocities. We
apply our methodology to the semi-analytical model GALFORM on a large N-body
simulation. The Ly{\alpha} photons escape through an outflowing neutral gas
medium, implemented assuming different geometries. This results in different
predictions for the typical column density and outflow velocities of the LAE
population. To understand the impact of radiative transfer on our predictions,
we contrast our models against a simple abundance matching assignment. Our full
models populate LAEs in less massive haloes than what is obtained with
abundance matching. Overall, radiative transfer effects result in better
agreement when confronting the properties of LAEs against observational
measurements. This suggest that incorporating the effects of Ly{\alpha}
radiative transfer in the analysis of this galaxy population, including their
clustering, can be important for obtaining an unbiased interpretation of future
datasets.

telescopes around the globe organised to follow up transiting planet candidate
KOIs with large transit timing variations (TTVs). Its main goal is to complete
their TTV curves, as the Kepler telescope no longer observes the original
Kepler field. Combining Kepler and new ground-based transit data we improve the
modelling of these systems. To this end, we have developed a photodynamical
model, and we demonstrate its performance using the Kepler-9 system as an
example. Our comprehensive analysis combines the numerical integration of the
system's dynamics over the time span of the observations along with the transit
light curve model. This model is coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm, allowing the exploration of the model parameter space. Applied to
the Kepler-9 long cadence data, short cadence data and 13 new transit
observations collected by KOINet between the years 2014 to 2017, our modelling
provides well constrained predictions for the next transits and the system's
parameters. We have determined the densities of the planets Kepler-9b and 9c to
the very precise values of rho_b = 0.439 +/-0.023 g/cm3 and rho_c = 0.322 +/-
0.017 g/cm3. Our analysis reveals that Kepler-9c will stop transiting in about
30 years. This results from strong dynamical interactions between Kepler-9b and
9c, near 2:1 resonance, that leads to a periodic change in inclination. Over
the next 30 years the inclination of Kepler-9c (-9b) will decrease (increase)
slowly. This should be measurable by a substantial decrease (increase) in the
transit duration, in as soon as a few years' time. Observations that contradict
this prediction might indicate the presence of additional objects. If this
prediction proves true, this behaviour opens up a unique chance to scan the
different latitudes of a star.

information of the distance scale since we can infer the absolute luminosity of
the source from analysis of the wave form, which is known as standard sirens.
The first detection of the gravitational wave signal of the binary black hole
merger event by Advanced LIGO has opened up the possibility of utilizing
standard sirens as cosmological probe. In order to extract information of the
distance-redshift relation, we cross-correlate weak lensing, which is an
unbiased tracer of matter distribution in the Universe, with the projected
number density of gravitational wave sources. For weak lensing, we employ
tomography technique to efficiently obtain information of large-scale
structures at wide ranges of redshifts. Making use of the cross-correlations
along with the auto-correlations, we present forecast of constraints on four
cosmological parameters, i.e., Hubble parameter, matter density, the equation
of state parameter of dark energy, and the amplitude of matter fluctuation. To
fully explore the ability of cross-correlations, which require large
overlapping sky coverage, we consider the specific case with the upcoming
surveys by \textit{Euclid} for weak lensing and Einstein Telescope for standard
sirens. We show that cosmological parameters can be tightly constrained solely
by these auto- and cross-correlations of standard sirens and weak lensing. For
example, the $1\text{-}\sigma$ error of Hubble parameter is expected to be
$\sigma (H_0) = 0.33 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.

flux that was surrounded by a circular, quiescent filament. Within only eight
hours of the start of the emergence, a partial splitting of the filament and
two consecutive coronal mass ejections took place. We argue that all three
dynamic events occurred as a result of particular magnetic-reconnection
episodes between the emerging bipole and the pre-existing coronal magnetic
field. In order to substantiate our interpretation, we consider
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations that model the emergence of
magnetic flux in the vicinity of a large-scale coronal flux rope. The
simulations qualitatively reproduce most of the reconnection episodes suggested
by the observations; as well as the filament-splitting, the first eruption, and
the formation of sheared/twisted fields that may have played a role in the
second eruption. Our results suggest that the position of emerging flux with
respect to the background magnetic configuration is a crucial factor for the
resulting evolution, while previous results suggest that parameters such as the
orientation or the amount of emerging flux are important as well. This poses a
challenge for predicting the onset of eruptions that are triggered by flux
emergence, and it calls for a detailed survey of the relevant parameter space
by means of numerical simulations.

consistent with being well aligned with the spin axis of the host star at
lambda = -10 +3.6/-3.8 deg. We suggest, via dynamical N-body simulations, that
the two planets in the system must be co-planar, and thus are both well aligned
with the host star. HD 106315 is only the fourth warm Neptune system with
obliquities measured. All warm Neptune systems have been found in well aligned
geometries, consistent with the interpretation that these systems are formed
in-situ in the inner protoplanetary disk, and also consistent with the majority
of Kepler multi-planet systems that are in low obliquity orbits. With a transit
depth of 1.02 mmag, HD 106315c is among the smallest planets to have been
detected in transit spectroscopy, and we discuss its detection in the context

  The main goal of this paper is to answer these questions and to convey the
message that instead of reporting only detection accuracy also power
consumption and inference time should be reported as real usability of the
proposed systems and their adoption in human computer interaction strongly
depends on it. In this paper, we identify the state-of-the art face emotion

the most frequently used datasets for this task. Our study shows that most of
the performed experiments use datasets with posed expressions or in a

methods in the realistic scenario, we collect a new dataset with
non-exaggerated emotions and we use it, in addition to the publicly available
datasets, for the evaluation of detection accuracy, power consumption and
inference time on three frequently used embedded devices with different
computational capabilities. Our results show that gray images are still more
suitable for embedded environment than color ones and that for most of the
analyzed systems either inference time or energy consumption or both are

in a complex separable Hilbert space. We consider a perturbation of a
non-selfadjoint operator by an operator that is also non-selfadjoint. Our
consideration is based on known spectral properties of the real component of a
non-selfadjoint compact operator. Using a technic of the sesquilinear form
theory we establish the compactness property of the resolvent, obtain the
asymptotic equivalence between the real component of the resolvent and the
resolvent of the real component for some class of non-selfadjoint operators. We
obtain a classification of non-selfadjoint operators in accordance with
belonging their resolvent to the Schatten-von Neumann class and formulate a
sufficient condition of completeness of the root vectors system. Finally we
obtain an asymptotic formula for eigenvalues of the considered class of
non-selfadjoint operators.

intergalactic scales, its LyA emission may either trace high-density ionized
gas (""clumps"") or large column densities of neutral material. To distinguish
between these two possibilities, information from a non-resonant line such as
Halpha is crucial. Therefore, we analyzed a deep MOSFIRE observation of one of
the brightest LyA emitting regions in the Slug Nebula with the goal of
detecting associated Halpha emission. We also obtained a deep, moderate
resolution LyA spectrum of the nearby brightest region of the Slug. We detected
an Halpha flux of F_(Halpha)= 2.62 +/- 0.47 x 10^-17 erg/cm^2/s
(SB_(Halpha)=2.70 +/- 0.48 x 10^-18 erg/cm^2/s/sq"") at the expected spatial and
spectral location. Combining the Halpha detection with its corresponding LyA
flux (determined from the narrow-band imaging) we calculate a flux ratio of
F_(LyA_/F_(Halpha)= 5.5 +/- 1.1. The presence of a skyline at the location of
the Halpha emission decreases the signal to noise ratio of the detection and
our ability to put stringent constraints on the Halpha kinematics. Our
measurements argue for the origin of the LyA emission being recombination
radiation, suggesting the presence of high-density ionized gas. Finally, our
high-resolution spectroscopic study of the LyA emission does not show evidence

been identified as a core element to improve the statistical performance of
modern large-scale machine learning algorithms. Data shuffling is often
considered as one of the most significant bottlenecks in such systems due to
the heavy communication load. Under a master-worker architecture (where a
master has access to the entire dataset and only communication between the
master and the workers is allowed) coding has been recently proved to
considerably reduce the communication load. This work considers a different
communication paradigm referred to as decentralized data shuffling, where
workers are allowed to communicate with one another via a shared link. The
decentralized data shuffling problem has two phases: workers communicate with
each other during the data shuffling phase, and then workers update their
stored content during the storage phase. The main challenge is to derive novel
converse bounds and achievable schemes for decentralized data shuffling by
considering the asymmetry of the workers' storages (i.e., workers are
constrained to store different files in their storages based on the problem
setting), in order to characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. For
the case of uncoded storage (i.e., each worker directly stores a subset of bits
of the dataset), this paper proposes converse and achievable bounds (based on
distributed interference alignment and distributed clique-covering strategies)
that are within a factor of 3/2 of one another. The proposed schemes are also
exactly optimal under the constraint of uncoded storage for either large
storage size or at most four workers in the system.

an electromagnetic breakdown. In this paper, we review recent theoretical and
experimental results on development of the above mentioned thermomagnetic
instability. Starting from linear stability analysis for the initial
critical-state flux distribution we then discuss a numerical procedure allowing
to analyze developed flux avalanches. As an example of this approach we
consider ultra-fast dendritic flux avalanches in thin superconducting disks. At
the initial stage the flux front corresponding to the dendrite's trunk moves
with velocity up to 100~km/s. At later stage the almost constant velocity leads
to a specific propagation regime similar to ray optics. We discuss this regime
observed in superconducting films coated by normal strips. Finally, we discuss
dramatic enhancement of the anisotropy of the flux patterns due to specific
dynamics. In this way we demonstrate that the combination of the linear

the bending behavior via scales engagement. This engagement is the dominant
source of nonlinearity in small deflection regime. As deformation proceeds, an
initially linear bending response gives way to progressive stiffening and
thereafter a geometrically dictated 'locked' configuration. However,
investigation of this system has been carried out until date using assumption
of periodic engagement even after scales contact. This is true only under the
most ideal loading conditions or if the scales are extremely dense akin to a
continuum assumption on the scales. However, this is not true for a practical
system where scales are more discrete and where loading can alter periodicity
of engagement. We address this nonlinear problem for the first time in small
deflection and rotation regime. Our combined modeling and numerical analysis
show that relaxing periodicity better represents the geometry of discrete
scales engagement and mechanics of the beam under general loading conditions
and allows us to revisit the nonlinear behavior. We report significant
differences from predictions of periodic models in terms of predicting the
behavior of scales after engagement. These include the difference in the
angular displacement of scales, normal force magnitudes along the length,
moment curvature relationship as well as a distinct nature of the locking
behavior. Therefore, non-periodicity is an important yet unexplored feature of
this problem, which leads to insights, absent in previous investigations. This
opens way for developing the structure-property-architecture framework for
design and optimization of these topologically leveraged solids.

IID normal errors. This strong parametric assumption can lead to misleading
inference and uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we use the classic
Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) mechanism to nonparametrically model the error

choose the parameters of the DPM so that the strengths of the standard BART

ability to adapt to non-normal errors.

the resulting estimators typically converge at a faster rate than pseudo-random
Monte Carlo. However, they can be difficult to set up on arbitrary posterior
densities within the Bayesian framework, in particular for inverse problems. We
introduce a general parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, for
which we prove a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem. In that
context, non-reversible transitions are investigated. We then extend this
approach to the use of adaptive kernels and state conditions, under which
ergodicity holds. As a further extension, an importance sampling estimator is
derived, for which asymptotic unbiasedness is proven. We consider the use of
completely uniformly distributed (CUD) numbers within the above mentioned
algorithms, which leads to a general parallel quasi-MCMC (QMCMC) methodology.
We prove consistency of the resulting estimators and demonstrate numerically
that this approach scales close to $n^{-2}$ as we increase parallelisation,
instead of the usual $n^{-1}$ that is typical of standard MCMC algorithms. In
practical statistical models we observe multiple orders of magnitude
improvement compared with pseudo-random methods.

a few measurements of this type have been reported in the literature and
phenomenological models, which facilitate physical interpretation of the
correlation structures, are non-existent. On-going effort at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) will provide a significant volume of these
correlation measurements in the future. In anticipation of these new data two
phenomenological models are developed which describe two-dimensional 2D
correlation distributions on transverse momentum. One model is based on a
collision event-by-event fluctuating blast wave. The other is based on
event-by-event fluctuations in fragmenting color-flux tubes and in jets. Both
models are shown to be capable of accurately describing the measured
single-particle $p_t$ distributions for minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$~GeV. Both models are then applied to preliminary,
charged-particle correlation measurements on 2D transverse momentum. The
capabilities of the two models for describing the overall structure of these
correlations, the stability of the fitting results with respect to collision
centrality, and the resulting trends of the dynamical fluctuations are
evaluated. In general, both phenomenological models are capable of
qualitatively describing the major correlation structures on transverse
momentum and can be used to establish the required magnitudes and centrality
trends of the fluctuations. Both models will be useful for interpreting the
forthcoming correlation data from the RHIC.

luminosity thresholds (>~ 30 L_sun) result in galaxies with unnatural colors

formation observed at UV-NIR wavelengths become redder than uncloaked galaxies
as L_min increases. Recently star-forming galaxies get bluer in UV and blue
light when they are cloaked, with colors similar to quasars but very low

Galerkin (DG) methods for wave propagation problems in fluids, solids, and
electromagnetism. In each of these areas, we describe the methods, discuss
their main features, display numerical results to illustrate their performance,
and conclude with bibliography notes. The main ingredients in devising these DG
methods are (i) a local Galerkin projection of the underlying partial
differential equations at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of
degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace;
(ii) a judicious choice of the numerical flux to provide stability and
consistency; and (iii) a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of
the numerical flux to obtain a global system in terms of the numerical trace.
These DG methods are termed hybridized DG methods, because they are amenable to
hybridization (static condensation) and hence to more efficient
implementations. They share many common advantages of DG methods and possess
some unique features that make them well-suited to wave propagation problems.

with a $1/r^{3}$ power-law behavior, reminiscent of elastic fields around an

correlation amplitude are in line with the results obtained from experiments

""solid-like"" cooperative strain pattern in a supercooled liquid, is determined
by the product of the speed of sound with the structural relaxation time. While
this length is of the order of nanometers in the normal liquid state, it grows
to macroscale when approaching the glass transition.

lung cancer. Though the status of large nodules can be easily diagnosed by fine
needle biopsy or bronchoscopy, small nodules are often difficult to classify on
computed tomography (CT). Recent works have shown that shape analysis of lung
nodules can be used to differentiate benign lesions from malignant ones, though
existing methods are limited in their sensitivity and specificity. In this work
we introduced a new 3D shape analysis within the framework of differential
geometry to calculate the Wasserstein distance between benign and malignant
lung nodules to derive an accurate classification scheme. The Wasserstein
distance between the nodules is calculated based on our new spherical optimal
mass transport, this new algorithm works directly on sphere by using spherical
metric, which is much more accurate and efficient than previous methods. In the
process of deformation, the area-distortion factor gives a probability measure
on the unit sphere, which forms the Wasserstein space. From known cases of
benign and malignant lung nodules, we can calculate a unique optimal mass
transport map between their correspondingly deformed Wasserstein spaces. This
transportation cost defines the Wasserstein distance between them and can be
used to classify new lung nodules into either the benign or malignant class. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes Wasserstein
distance for lung nodule classification. The advantages of Wasserstein distance
are it is invariant under rigid motions and scalings, thus it intrinsically
measures shape distance even when the underlying shapes are of high complexity,
making it well suited to classify lung nodules as they have different sizes,
orientations, and appearances.

predicted for dwarfs and giants the jitter due to stellar oscillations, which
in velocity have much larger amplitudes than noise introduced by granulation.
We then fitted the jitter in terms of the following sets of stellar parameters:
(1) Luminosity, mass, and effective temperature: the fit returns precisions
(i.e., standard deviations of fractional residuals) of 17.9% and 27.1% for
dwarfs and giants, respectively. (2) Luminosity, effective temperature, and
surface gravity: The precisions are the same as using the previous parameter
set. (3) Surface gravity and effective temperature: we obtain a precision of
22.6% for dwarfs and 27.1% for giants. (4): Luminosity and effective
temperature: the precision is 47.8% for dwarfs and 27.5% for giants. Our method
will be valuable for anticipating the radial-velocity stellar noise level of

similar in SNe Ib and IIb after maximum light. The He I $\lambda\lambda5876,
7065$ velocities at maximum light are higher in SNe Ib compared to SNe IIb. We
have identified an anticorrelation between the He I $\lambda7065$ pEW and O I
$\lambda7774$ velocity among SNe IIb and Ib. This can be interpreted as a
continuum in the amount of He present at the time of explosion. It has been
suggested that SNe Ib and Ic have similar amounts of He, and that lower mixing
could be responsible for hiding He in SNe Ic. However, our data contradict this
mixing hypothesis. The observed difference in the expansion rate of the ejecta
around maximum light of SNe Ic
($V_{\mathrm{m}}=\sqrt{2E_{\mathrm{k}}/M_{\mathrm{ej}}}\approx15,000$ km
s$^{-1}$) and SNe Ib ($V_{\mathrm{m}}\approx9000$ km s$^{-1}$) would imply an
average He mass difference of $\sim1.4$ $M_{\odot}$, if the other explosion
parameters are assumed to be unchanged between the SE SN subtypes. We conclude
that SNe Ic do not hide He but lose He due to envelope stripping.

cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Because the complete gene mutational
landscape cannot be characterized through biopsy and sequencing assays for each
patient, non-invasive tools are needed to determine the mutation status for
tumors. Radiogenomics may be an attractive alternative tool to identify disease
genomics by analyzing amounts of features extracted from medical images. Most
current radiogenomics predictive models are built based on a single classifier
and trained through a single objective. However, since many classifiers are
available, selecting an optimal model is difficult. On the other hand, a single
objective may not be a good measure to guide model training. We proposed a new
multi-classifier multi-objective (MCMO) radiogenomics predictive model. To
obtain more reliable prediction results, similarity-based sensitivity and
specificity were defined and considered as the two objective functions
simultaneously during training. To take advantage of different classifiers, the
evidential reasoning (ER) approach was used for fusing the output of each
classifier. Additionally, a new similarity-based multi-objective optimization
algorithm (SMO) was developed for training the MCMO to predict ccRCC related
gene mutations (VHL, PBRM1 and BAP1). Preliminary results revealed an
association between some quantitative computed tomography (CT) features and
underlying mutations. Using the proposed MCMO model, we achieved a predictive
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) over 0.86 for VHL,
PBRM1, and BAP1 genes with balanced sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore,
MCMO outperformed all the individual classifiers and yielded more reliable
results than other optimization algorithms and commonly used fusion strategies.

elements with memory to both store and process information on the same physical

electronic circuits, thus offering a path to its practical realization. In
addition, since memcomputing is based on non-quantum elements, the equations of
motion describing these machines can be simulated efficiently on standard
computers. In fact, it was recently realized that memcomputing, and in
particular its digital (hence scalable) version, when simulated on a classical
machine provides a significant speed-up over state-of-the-art algorithms on a
variety of non-convex problems. Here, we stress-test the capabilities of this
approach on finding approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization
problems. These fall into a class which is known to require exponentially
growing resources in the worst cases, even to generate approximations. We
recently showed that in a region where state of the art algorithms demonstrate
this exponential growth, simulations of digital memcomputing machines performed
using the Falcon$^\copyright$ simulator of MemComputing, Inc. only require time
and memory resources that scale linearly. These results are extended in a
stress-test up to $64\times10^6$ variables (corresponding to about 1 billion

GB of DRAM. Since memcomputing can be applied to a wide variety of optimization

themselves for conquering network sparseness and anchor sparseness. But
component-based methods are sensitive to ranging noises, which may cause a huge
accumulated error either in component realization or merging process. This
paper presents three results for robust component-based localization under
ranging noises. (1) For a rigid graph component, a novel method is proposed to
evaluate the graph's possible number of flip ambiguities under noises. In
particular, graph's \emph{MInimal sepaRators that are neaRly cOllineaR
(MIRROR)} is presented as the cause of flip ambiguity, and the number of
MIRRORs indicates the possible number of flip ambiguities under noise. (2) Then
the sensitivity of a graph's local deforming regarding ranging noises is
investigated by perturbation analysis. A novel Ranging Sensitivity Matrix (RSM)
is proposed to estimate the node location perturbations due to ranging noises.
(3) By evaluating component robustness via the flipping and the local deforming
risks, a Robust Component Generation and Realization (RCGR) algorithm is
developed, which generates components based on the robustness metrics. RCGR was
evaluated by simulations, which showed much better noise resistance and
locating accuracy improvements than state-of-the-art of component-based

one of challenging topics in astrochemistry. Here, we present the chemical
modeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase
chemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For
the formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent
results with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of
COOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings
regarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.
First, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature
programmed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine
was destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals
before it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase
is more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,
NH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the
essential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase
glycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early
evolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the
future glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the
suprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH
radicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of
glycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in
detail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future.

applies superposition coding and successive interference cancellation decoding
to each group composed of users with closely-aligned channels, while applying
zero-forcing beamforming across semi-orthogonal user groups. In order to enable
such analysis, closed-form lower bounds on the achievable rates of a general
multiple-input single-output broadcast channel with superposition coding and
successive interference cancellation are newly derived. By employing
channel-adaptive user grouping and proper power allocation, which ensures that
the channel subspaces of user groups have angle larger than a certain
threshold, it is shown that the mixture transceiver architecture achieves full
diversity order in multiple-input single-output broadcast channels and
opportunistically increases the multiplexing gain while achieving full
diversity order. Furthermore, the achieved full diversity order is the same as
that of the single-user maximum ratio transmit beamforming. Hence, the mixture
scheme can provide reliable communication under channel fading for
ultra-reliable low latency communication. Numerical results validate our
analysis and show the outage superiority of the mixture scheme over
conventional transceiver designs for multiple-input single-output broadcast
channels.

{\em value}. An algorithm can transmit at most one packet from the buffer at
each integer time and can gain its value as the {\em profit} if transmitting a

to maximize the gained profit. We say that an instance of the problem is

it. For any $s \geq 2$, Hajek (CISS 2001) showed that the competitive ratio of

particular attention to producing realistic education and employment records.
'ProfileGen' creates honeypot profiles that are similar to actual data by
extrapolating the characteristics and properties of real data items. Evaluation

sound event localization and detection (SELD) of multiple overlapping sound
events in three-dimensional (3D) space. The proposed network takes a sequence
of consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in
parallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as
a multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal
activity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is
performed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the
direction-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output
regression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with
respective sound event labels and further track this association with respect
to time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component
of the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby
avoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is
evaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with
different overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life
scenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation,
and one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic
and applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values,
reverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a
consistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in

significantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of

productivity conundrum as they fail to find sufficient strong arguments to
justify the cost of a new technology yet cannot afford not to invest in new
technologies to match up with competitors. The question is whether there is an
innovative solution to maximally utilize available resources and drastically
reduce the effect that the shortages of resources may cause yet achieving high
level of service quality at a low cost. This work demonstrates with a practical

network (FrScatNet), which is a generalized translation invariant version of
the classical wavelet scattering network (ScatNet). Methods: In our approach,
the FrScatNet is constructed based on the fractional wavelet transform (FRWT).
The fractional scattering coefficients are iteratively computed using FRWTs and
modulus operators. The feature vectors constructed by fractional scattering
coefficients are usually used for signal classification. In this work, an
application example of FrScatNet is provided in order to assess its performance
on pathological images. Firstly, the FrScatNet extracts feature vectors from
patches of the original histological images under different orders. Then we
classify those patches into target (benign or malignant) and background groups.
And the FrScatNet property is analyzed by comparing error rates computed from
different fractional orders respectively. Based on the above pathological image
classification, a gland segmentation algorithm is proposed by combining the
boundary information and the gland location. Results: The error rates for
different fractional orders of FrScatNet are examined and show that the
classification accuracy is significantly improved in fractional scattering
domain. We also compare the FrScatNet based gland segmentation method with
those proposed in the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge and our method
achieves comparable results. Conclusion: The FrScatNet is shown to achieve
accurate and robust results. More stable and discriminative fractional
scattering coefficients are obtained by the FrScatNet in this work.
Significance: The added fractional order parameter is able to analyze the image
in the fractional scattering domain.

We produced amplitude distributions for each pulsar which we fit with
log-normal distributions, power-law tails, and a power-law function divided by
an exponential function, finding that some pulsars show a deviation from a
log-normal distribution in the form of an excess of high-energy pulses. We
found that a function consisting of a power-law divided by an exponential fit
the distributions of most pulsars better than either log-normal or power-law
functions. For pulsars that were detected in a periodicity search, we computed
the ratio of their single-pulse signal-to-noise ratios to their signal-to-noise
ratios from a Fourier transform and looked for correlations between this ratio
and physical parameters of the pulsars. The only correlation found is the
expected relationship between this ratio and the spin period. Fitting
log-normal distributions to the amplitudes of pulses from RRATs showed similar
behaviour for most RRATs. Here, however, there seem to be two distinct
distributions of pulses, with the lower-energy distribution being consistent

consistent with those found for normal pulsars, suggesting that pulsars and

contradicting a piezoelectric origin. Here we show that, if a piezoelectric
material has its piezoelectric coefficient be asymmetrically distributed across

effective flexoelectric coefficient caused by piezoelectricity is functionally
identical to, and often larger than, intrinsic flexoelectricity: the
calculations show that, for standard perovskite ferroelectrics, even a tiny
gradient of piezoelectricity (1% variation of piezoelectric coefficient across
1 mm) is sufficient to yield a giant effective flexoelectric coefficient of 1
$\mu$C/m, three orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic expectation
value.

labeled data in learning systems (e.g., model/classifier training) has
attracted increasing attentions due to its fundamental importance. To address
this problem, many active learning (AL) methods have been proposed that employ
up-to-date detectors to retrieve representative minority samples according to
predefined confidence or uncertainty thresholds. However, these AL methods
cause the detectors to ignore the remaining majority samples (i.e., those with
low uncertainty or high prediction confidence). In this work, by developing a
principled active sample mining (ASM) framework, we demonstrate that
cost-effectively mining samples from these unlabeled majority data is key to
training more powerful object detectors while minimizing user effort.
Specifically, our ASM framework involves a switchable sample selection
mechanism for determining whether an unlabeled sample should be manually
annotated via AL or automatically pseudo-labeled via a novel self-learning
process. The proposed process can be compatible with mini-batch based training
(i.e., using a batch of unlabeled or partially labeled data as a one-time
input) for object detection. In addition, a few samples with low-confidence
predictions are selected and annotated via AL. Notably, our method is suitable
for object categories that are not seen in the unlabeled data during the
learning process. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our ASM
framework can achieve performance comparable to that of alternative methods but
with significantly fewer annotations.

  An $m$-cover $\cal L$ of ${\rm PG}(r,q)$ is an $(r-2)$-dual $m$-cover if

adjustable robust optimization problem with fixed recourse and uncertain right
hand side belonging to a budgeted uncertainty set. This is an important class
of uncertainty sets widely used in practice where we can specify a budget on
the adversarial deviations of the uncertain parameters from the nominal values
to adjust the level of conservatism. The two-stage adjustable robust
optimization problem is hard to approximate within a factor better than $\Omega
\left( \frac{\log n}{\log \log n} \right)$ even for budget of uncertainty sets
and fixed non-negative recourse where $n$ is the number of decision variables.
Affine policies, where the second-stage decisions are constrained to be an
affine function of the uncertain parameters, provide a tractable approximation
for the problem and have been observed to exhibit good empirical performance.
We show that affine policies give an $O\left( \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}
\right)$-approximation for the two-stage adjustable robust problem with fixed
non-negative recourse for budgeted uncertainty sets. This matches the hardness
of approximation and therefore, surprisingly affine policies provide an optimal
approximation for the problem (up to a constant factor). We also show strong
theoretical performance bounds for affine policy for significantly more general
class of intersection of budgeted sets including disjoint constrained budgeted
sets, permutation invariant sets and general intersection of budgeted sets. Our
analysis relies on showing the existence of a near-optimal feasible affine
policy that satisfies certain nice structural properties. Based on these
structural properties, we also present an alternate algorithm to compute
near-optimal affine solution that is significantly faster than computing the
optimal affine policy by solving a large linear program.

Consequently, the S-matrix of input-output problems is determined exactly by
the Mahaux-Weidenm\""uller formula, which dramatically simplifies the analysis
of complex cavity QED systems. First, this approach is illustrated for the
problem of propagation of a photon resonantly interacting with N two-level QEs
arbitrary distributed inside the optical cavity. Solution of this problem
manifests the effect of cumulative action of QEs previously known for special
cases. Can a similar cumulative action of QEs enhance the inelastic resonant
transmission of a single photon? We solve this problem for the case of an
optical cavity having two modes resonantly coupled to electronic transitions of
N three-level QEs. It is shown that the described structure is the simplest
realistic structure which enables the down-conversion of the single photon
frequency with the amplitude approaching unity in the absence of the external
driving field and for sufficiently small cavity losses and QE dissipation.
Overall, the simplicity and generality of the developed approach suggest a
practical way to identify and describe new phenomena in cavity QED.

total gas surface densities of M33 are determined at a resolution of about
50~pc over regions that share coherent morphological properties to unveil
fingerprints of self-gravity across the star-forming disk. Most of the total
gas PDFs from the central region to the edge of the star-forming disk are
well-fitted by log-normal functions whose width decreases radially outwards.
Because the HI velocity dispersion is approximately constant across the disk,
the decrease of the PDF width is consistent with a lower Mach number for the
turbulent ISM at large galactocentric radii where a higher fraction of HI is in
the warm phase. The atomic gas is found mostly at face-on column densities
below N$_{H}^{lim}$=2.5 10$^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$, with small radial variations of
N$_{H}^{lim}$. The molecular gas PDFs do not show strong deviations from
log-normal functions in the central region where molecular fractions are high.
Here the high pressure and rate of star formation shapes the PDF as a
log-normal function dispersing self-gravitating complexes with intense feedback
at all column densities that are spatially resolved. Power law PDFs for the
molecules are found near and above N$_H^{lim}$, in the well defined southern
spiral arm and in a continuous dense filament extending at larger
galactocentric radii; this is evident in cloud samples at different
evolutionary stages along the star formation cycle. In the filament nearly half
of the molecular gas departs from a log-normal PDF and power laws are also
observed in pre-star forming molecular complexes. The slope of the power law is
between -1 and -2. This slope, combined with maps showing where the different
parts of the power law PDFs come from, suggest a power-law stratification of
density within molecular cloud complexes, which is consistent with the
dominance of self-gravity.

denote an asymptotic parameter denoting the steepness of the water wave, we use
a Stokes expansion in epsilon to derive a set of linear recursion relations for
the tangential component of velocity, the stream function, and the water wave
parameterization. The solution of the water waves system is obtained as an
infinite sum of solutions to linear problems at each epsilon^k level, and
truncation of this series leads to our two asymptotic models, that we call the
quadratic and cubic h-models.
  Using the growth rate of the Catalan numbers (from number theory), we prove
well-posedness of the h-models in spaces of analytic functions, and prove error
bounds for solutions of the h-models compared against solutions of the water
waves system. We also show that the Craig-Sulem models of water waves can be
obtained from our asymptotic procedure and that their WW2 model is well-posed

immersed in a viscous fluid by approximating each fiber using only the geometry
of the fiber centerline curve and the line force density along it. However, it
has been unclear how well slender body theory actually approximates Stokes flow
about a thin but truly three-dimensional fiber, in part due to the fact that
simply prescribing data along a one-dimensional curve does not result in a
well-posed boundary value problem for the Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Here, we introduce a PDE problem to which slender body theory (SBT) provides an
approximation, thereby placing SBT on firm theoretical footing. The slender
body PDE is a new type of boundary value problem for Stokes flow where partial
Dirichlet and partial Neumann conditions are specified everywhere along the
fiber surface. Given only a 1D force density along a closed fiber, we show that
the flow field exterior to the thin fiber is uniquely determined by imposing a
fiber integrity condition: the surface velocity field on the fiber must be
constant along cross sections orthogonal to the fiber centerline. Furthermore,
a careful estimation of the residual, together with stability estimates
provided by the PDE well-posedness framework, allow us to establish error
estimates between the slender body approximation and the exact solution to the
above problem. The error is bounded by an expression proportional to the fiber
radius (up to logarithmic corrections) under mild regularity assumptions on the
1D force density and fiber centerline geometry.

Lagrangian $\mathcal L_1$ for matter with the introduction of a Lagrange
multiplier as constraint. We also add a symmetry breaking effective potential
accounting for the classical cosmological constant problem, by adding a second
Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_2$. Investigating the Noether current due to the shift
symmetry on the scalar field, $\varphi\rightarrow\varphi+c^0$, we show that
$\mathcal{L}_1$ turns out to be independent from the scalar field $\varphi$.
Further we find that a positive Helmotz free-energy naturally leads to a
negative pressure without introducing by hand any dark energy term. To face out
the fine-tuning problem, we investigate two phases: before and after transition
due to the symmetry breaking. We propose that during transition dark matter
cancels out the quantum field vacuum energy effects. This process leads to a
negative and constant pressure whose magnitude is determined by baryons only.
The numerical bounds over the pressure and matter densities are in agreement
with current observations, alleviating the coincidence problem. Finally
assuming a thermal equilibrium between the bath and our effective fluid, we
estimate the mass of the dark matter candidate. Our numerical outcomes seem to
be compatible with recent predictions on WIMP masses, for fixed spin and
temperature. In particular, we predict possible candidates whose masses span in

trivial case of the Levi-Civita connection, geometries with non-vanishing
parallel skew-symmetric torsion arise naturally in several geometric contexts,
e.g. on naturally reductive homogeneous spaces, nearly K\""ahler or nearly
parallel $\mathrm{G}_2$-manifolds, Sasakian and $3$-Sasakian manifolds, or
twistor spaces over quaternion-K\""ahler manifolds with positive scalar

carrying a metric connection with parallel skew-symmetric torsion. On every
such manifold one can define a natural splitting of the tangent bundle which
gives rise to a Riemannian submersion over a geometry with parallel
skew-symmetric torsion of smaller dimension endowed with some extra structure.
We show how previously known examples of geometries with parallel
skew-symmetric torsion fit into this pattern, and construct several new

the corresponding geometries with parallel skew-symmetric torsion.

three-dimensional hole-like Fermi surface pocket reported by quantum
oscillations. Supported by first-principles calculations, our ARPES study shows
that the van Hove singularity previously reported in KFe$_2$As$_2$ moves closer
to the Fermi level under negative chemical pressure. This observation, which
suggests that the large density-of-states accompanying the van Hove singularity
contributes to the large Sommerfeld coefficient reported for the AFe$_2$As$_2$

scattering revealed by transport under external pressure, thus offering a
possible interpretation for the origin of the apparent change in the

characteristic temperature $T^*$. We speculate how the low-energy location of

and forestry makes it necessary to consider how the actions of one manager
affect neighbouring properties. In addition to the direct effects of a
potential spread of a pest and the resulting economic loss, there are also
indirect consequences that affect whole regions and that require coordinated
actions to manage and/or to eradicate it (like movement restrictions). In this
paper we address the emergence and stability of cooperation among agents who
respond to a threat of an invasive pest or disease. The model, based on the
weakest-link paradigm, uses repeated multi-participant coordination games where
players' pay-offs depend on management decisions to prevent the invasion on
their own land as well as of their neighbours on a network. We show that for
the basic cooperation game agents select the risk-dominant strategy of a Stag
hunt game over the pay-off dominant strategy of implementing control measures.
However, cooperation can be achieved by the social planner offering a
biosecurity payment. The critical level of this payment depends on the details
of the decision-making process, with higher trust (based on a reputation of
other agents reflecting their past performance) allowing a significant
reduction in necessary payments and slowing down decay in cooperation when the
payment is low. We also find that allowing for uncertainty in decision-making
process can enhance cooperation for low levels of payments. Finally, we show
the importance of industry structure to the emergence of cooperation, with
increase in the average coordination number of network nodes leading to
increase in the critical biosecurity payment.

propose a classification approach grounded in high performance tissue
assessment as an alternative to all-in-one localization and assessment models
that is also capable of pinpointing the causal pixels. First, the objective of
the mammography assessment task is formalized in the context of local tissue
classifiers. Then, the accuracy of a convolutional neural net is evaluated on
classifying patches of tissue with suspicious findings at varying scales, where
highest obtained AUC is above $0.9$. The local evaluations of one such expert
tissue classifier is used to augment the results of a heatmap regression model
and additionally recover the exact causal regions at high resolution as a
saliency image suitable for clinical settings.

the proposed model succeeded in generating outfits more flexibly without
requiring additional information. Moreover, the style information extracted by
the proposed model is easy to interpret. The proposed model was evaluated on
two human-generated outfit datasets. In a fashion item prediction task (missing

extraction task, the proposed model extracted some easily distinguishable

topic, because of limitations in cellular image quality and diversity of
nuclear morphology, i.e. varying nuclei shapes, sizes, and overlaps between
multiple cell nuclei. This has been a topic of enduring interest with promising
recent success shown by deep learning methods. These methods train for example
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a training set of input images and
known, labeled nuclei locations. Many of these methods are supplemented by
spatial or morphological processing. We develop a new approach that we call
Shape Priors with Convolutional Neural Networks (SP-CNN) to perform
significantly enhanced nuclei detection. A set of canonical shapes is prepared
with the help of a domain expert. Subsequently, we present a new network
structure that can incorporate `expected behavior' of nucleus shapes via two
components: {\em learnable} layers that perform the nucleus detection and a
{\em fixed} processing part that guides the learning with prior information.
Analytically, we formulate a new regularization term that is targeted at
penalizing false positives while simultaneously encouraging detection inside
cell nucleus boundary. Experimental results on a challenging dataset reveal
that SP-CNN is competitive with or outperforms several state-of-the-art
methods.

  Visual Cues for Pathological Glomerulus Classification","Accepted by AAAI 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pathological glomerulus classification plays a key role in the diagnosis of
nephropathy. As the difference between different subcategories is subtle,
doctors often refer to slides from different staining methods to make
decisions. However, creating correspondence across various stains is
labor-intensive, bringing major difficulties in collecting data and training a
vision-based algorithm to assist nephropathy diagnosis. This paper provides an
alternative solution for integrating multi-stained visual cues for glomerulus
classification. Our approach, named generator-to-classifier (G2C), is a
two-stage framework. Given an input image from a specified stain, several
generators are first applied to estimate its appearances in other staining
methods, and a classifier follows to combine visual cues from different stains
for prediction (whether it is pathological, or which type of pathology it has).
We optimize these two stages in a joint manner. To provide a reasonable
initialization, we pre-train the generators in an unlabeled reference set under
an unpaired image-to-image translation task, and then fine-tune them together
with the classifier. We conduct experiments on a glomerulus type classification
dataset collected by ourselves (there are no publicly available datasets for
this purpose). Although joint optimization slightly harms the authenticity of
the generated patches, it boosts classification performance, suggesting more
effective visual cues are extracted in an automatic way. We also transfer our
model to a public dataset for breast cancer classification, and outperform the
state-of-the-arts significantly.

Intelligence methods to a new task; and the real world performance of models
hinges on the quality and quantity of data available. Producing an image
dataset for semantic segmentation is resource intensive, particularly for
specialist subjects where class segmentation is not able to be effectively
farmed out. The benefit of producing a large, but poorly labelled, dataset
versus a small, expertly segmented dataset for semantic segmentation is an open
question. Here we show that a large, noisy dataset outperforms a small,
expertly segmented dataset for training a Fully Convolutional Network model for
semantic segmentation of corrosion in images. A large dataset of 250 images
with segmentations labelled by undergraduates and a second dataset of just 10
images, with segmentations labelled by subject matter experts were produced.
The mean Intersection over Union and micro F-score metrics were compared after
training for 50,000 epochs. This work is illustrative for researchers setting
out to develop deep learning models for detection and location of specialist

prevailing norms in fashion product/style, henceforth used interchangeably, and
a customer's perception of utility or fashionability, yet fashion e-retail
relies on algorithmically generated search and recommendation systems that
process structured data and images to best match customer preference. Retailers
study tastes solely as a function of what sold vs what did not, and take it to
represent customer preference. Such explicit modeling, however, belies the
underlying user preference, which is a complicated interplay of preference and
commercials such as brand, price point, promotions, other sale events, and
competitor push/marketing. It is hard to infer a notion of utility or even
customer preference by looking at sales data.
  In search and recommendation systems for fashion e-retail, customer
preference is implicitly derived by user-user similarity or item-item
similarity. In this work, we aim to derive a metric that separates the buying
preferences of users from the commercials of the merchandise (price,
promotions, etc). We extend our earlier work on explicit signals to gauge
sellability or preference with implicit signals from user behaviour.

structure that is postulated to underlie the fabric of space or space-time. I
consider how such a structure could relate to space and space-time, and the
implications of the existence of this structure for quantum theory. I compare
space and space-time to other spaces used in physics, such as configuration
space, phase space, and Hilbert space. I support the 'property view' of space,
opposing both the traditional views of space and space-time, substantivalism
and relationism. I argue that configuration space has a special status in the
microscopic world similar to the status of position space in the macroscopic
world. The prespace structure is compared with a computational system, in
particular to a cellular automaton, in which space and all physical quantities
are broken into discrete units. One way open for a prespace metaphysics can be
found if physics is made fully discrete. I suggest as a heuristic principle
that the physical laws of our world are such that the computational cost of
implementing those laws on an arbitrary computational system is minimized. I
discuss the 'measurement problem' of quantum mechanics. Considering how quantum
theory could be made fully discrete leads naturally to a suggestion of how
standard linear quantum mechanics could be modified to give a solution to the
measurement problem, calling this model Critical Complexity Quantum Mechanics
(CCQM). I compare CCQM with some other proposed solutions to the measurement
problem, in particular, the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini,
and Weber. Finally, I argue that the measure of the complexity of quantum
mechanical states introduced in CCQM also provides a new definition of entropy
for quantum mechanics, and suggests an objective foundation for statistical
mechanics, thermodynamics, and the arrow of time.

the well-known Lorentz gauge condition a fundamental solution which
incorporates the phase as well as the attenuation transmission coefficients is
derived by the authors. Next, a model is developed using this proposed
fundamental solution for modelling a coating layer of a buried pipeline.
Subsequently, a model of a buried coated pipeline in close proximity to a high
voltage power line is developed and numerically implemented. Finally, the model
is used to simulate two configurations in order the verify the proposed general
fundamental solution of the boundary element method for electromagnetic field
problems. Hereby, its validity is proven and it is shown that the generalized
