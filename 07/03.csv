wide-ranging auditory stimuli. While there have been many recent advancements
in the modeling of cochlear dynamics, it remains unclear what mathematical
structures underlie the essential features of the extended cochlea. We
construct a dynamical system consisting of a series of strongly coupled
critical oscillators to show that high-dimensional nonhyperbolic dynamics can
account for high-order compressive nonlinearities, amplification of weak input,
frequency selectivity, and traveling waves of activity. As a single Hopf
bifurcation generically gives rise to features of cochlea at a local level, the
nonhyperbolicity mechanism proposed in this paper can be seen as a
higher-dimensional analogue for the entire extended cochlea.

seamlessly feed the user requirements back into the simulation.
State-of-the-art attempts to achieve this, have resulted in the insertion of
so-called check- and break-points at fixed places in the code. Depending on the
size of the problem, this can still compromise the benefits of such an attempt,
thus, preventing the experience of real interactive computing. To leverage the
concept for a broader scope of applications, it is essential that a user
receives an immediate response from the simulation to his or her changes. Our
generic integration framework, targeted to the needs of the computational
engineering domain, supports distributed computations as well as on-the-fly
visualisation in order to reduce latency and enable a high degree of
interactivity with only minor code modifications. Namely, the regular course of
the simulation coupled to our framework is interrupted in small, cyclic
intervals followed by a check for updates. When new data is received, the
simulation restarts automatically with the updated settings (boundary
conditions, simulation parameters, etc.). To obtain rapid, albeit approximate
feedback from the simulation in case of perpetual user interaction, a
multi-hierarchical approach is advantageous. Within several different

psychological research, tend to proliferate the number of representation
schemes for emotion encoding. Thus, a large amount of representationally
incompatible emotion lexicons has been developed by various research groups
adopting one or the other emotion representation format. As a consequence, the
reusability of these resources decreases as does the comparability of systems

tools which map different representation formats onto each other for the sake
of mutual compatibility and interoperability of language resources. We present
the first large-scale investigation of such representation mappings for four

beryllium-7 specific activity shows periods of anticorrelation, implying slow
changes in its dynamics that become evident only over a prolonged period of

by the minimal KSVZ axion model. This is possible if the lowest energy
metastable minimum of the scalar potential has zero energy density, which is
possible in theoretical models of vacuum energy cancellation based on spacetime
averaging and in models based on energy parity. Dark energy is then understood
as being due to the energy density of the metastable electroweak vacuum
relative to a second quasi-degenerate metastable minimum. The requirement of
quasi-degenerate minima is a non-trivial condition which completely determines
the form of the potential for a given value of the axion decay constant,
$f_{a}$, and the PQ scalar self-coupling, $\lambda_{\phi}$. The existence of
the second quasi-degenerate minimum imposes a new lower bound on the axion
decay constant, $f_{a} \geq 2.39 \times 10^{10} \, \lambda_{\phi}^{-1/4}$ GeV.
If the PQ symmetry is broken after inflation then the lower bound on $f_{a}$
implies a lower bound on the amount of axion dark matter,
$\Omega_{a}/\Omega_{dm} \geq (0.28-0.46)\,\lambda_{\phi}^{-0.291}$, where the
range is due to the uncertainty in the amount of axion dark matter produced by
vacuum realignment, cosmic strings and domain walls, therefore at least 30$\%$
of dark matter must be due to axions if $\lambda_{\phi} \lesssim 1$. When
axions constitute all of the dark matter and the PQ symmetry is broken after
inflation, $f_{a}$, and so the form of the scalar potential, is completely
fixed for a given value of $\lambda_{\phi}$, with only a weak dependence on
$\lambda_{\phi}$. This will allow the inflation and post-inflation evolution of
the model to be quantitatively studied for a given inflation model and
dimensionally natural values of $\lambda_{\phi}$.

the imaginary part of the in-medium retarded correlator of the electromagnetic
current transverse to the spatial momentum of the photon. In a
Lorentz-covariant theory, this correlator can be parametrized by a scalar
function ${\cal G}_R(u\cdot {\cal K},{\cal K}^2)$, where $u$ is the fluid
four-velocity and ${\cal K}$ corresponds to the momentum of the photon. We
propose to compute the analytic continuation of ${\cal G}_R(u\cdot {\cal

values of the first argument, $u\cdot {\cal K}= i\omega_n$. At these
kinematics, the retarded correlator is equal to the Euclidean correlator
$G_E(\omega_n, k=i\omega_n)$, whose first argument is the Matsubara frequency
and the second is the spatial momentum. The Euclidean correlator, which is
directly accessible in lattice QCD simulations, must be given an imaginary
spatial momentum in order to realize the photon on-shell condition. Via a
once-subtracted dispersion relation that we derive in a standard way at fixed
${\cal K}^2=0$, the Euclidean correlator with imaginary spatial momentum is
related to the photon emission rate. The relation allows for a more direct
probing of the real-photon emission rate of the quark-gluon plasma in lattice
QCD than the dispersion relations which have been used so far, the latter being
at fixed spatial photon momentum $k$ and thus involving all possible
virtualities of the photon.

in-phase rotation motion. It is shown that out-of-phase rotations are the
result of parametric instability of in-phase motion. Complex out-of-phase
rotations are numerically found and their stability and bifurcations are
defined. It is demonstrated that emergence of chaotic dynamics happens due
period doubling bifurcation cascade. The detail scenario of symmetry breaking
is presented. The development of chaotic dynamics leads to origin of two
chaotic attractors of different types. The first one is characterized by the
different phases of all pendulums. In the second case the phases of two
pendulums are equal, and the phase of the third one is different. This regime
with partial symmetry breaking is a chaotic chimera.

attention. Prior work largely focuses on defining conditions for fairness, but
does not define satisfactory measures of algorithmic unfairness. In this paper,
we focus on the following question: Given two unfair algorithms, how should we
determine which of the two is more unfair? Our core idea is to use existing
inequality indices from economics to measure how unequally the outcomes of an
algorithm benefit different individuals or groups in a population. Our work
offers a justified and general framework to compare and contrast the
(un)fairness of algorithmic predictors. This unifying approach enables us to
quantify unfairness both at the individual and the group level. Further, our
work reveals overlooked tradeoffs between different fairness notions: using our
proposed measures, the overall individual-level unfairness of an algorithm can
be decomposed into a between-group and a within-group component. Earlier
methods are typically designed to tackle only between-group unfairness, which
may be justified for legal or other reasons. However, we demonstrate that
minimizing exclusively the between-group component may, in fact, increase the
within-group, and hence the overall unfairness. We characterize and illustrate
the tradeoffs between our measures of (un)fairness and the prediction accuracy.

dynamic shell of peripheral proteins that function in diverse
post-transcriptional processes. To illuminate consequences of EJC composition
change, we purified EJCs from human cells via peripheral proteins RNPS1 and
CASC3. We show that EJC originates as an SR-rich mega-dalton sized RNP that
contains RNPS1 but lacks CASC3. After mRNP export to the cytoplasm and before
translation, the EJC undergoes a remarkable compositional and structural
remodeling into an SR-devoid monomeric complex that contains CASC3.
Surprisingly, RNPS1 is important for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in
general whereas CASC3 is needed for NMD of only select mRNAs. The promotion of
switch to CASC3-EJC slows down NMD. Overall, the EJC compositional switch
dramatically alters mRNP structure and specifies two distinct phases of

significant attention both by industry and academia. Avoiding the exponential
overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of
larger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost
on a quantum computer. To this end, we propose a variational hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm called quantum-assisted quantum compiling (QAQC).
In QAQC, we use the overlap between a target unitary $U$ and a trainable
unitary $V$ as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. More
precisely, to ensure that QAQC scales well with problem size, our cost involves
not only the global overlap ${\rm Tr} (V^\dagger U)$ but also the local
overlaps with respect to individual qubits. We introduce novel short-depth
quantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function, and we prove that
our cost cannot be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under
reasonable complexity assumptions. We present both gradient-free and
gradient-based approaches to minimizing this cost. As a demonstration of QAQC,
we compile various one-qubit gates on IBM's and Rigetti's quantum computers
into their respective native gate alphabets. Furthermore, we successfully
simulate QAQC up to a problem size of 9 qubits, and these simulations highlight
both the scalability of our cost function as well as the noise resilience of
QAQC. Future applications of QAQC include algorithm depth compression,
black-box compiling, noise mitigation, and benchmarking.

As a concrete application, we build a binary classifier, train it on some

specifically, we use Microsoft's quantum simulator, Liquid, to construct local
Hamiltonians that can encode trained classifier functions in their ground
space, and which can be probed by measuring the overlap with test states
corresponding to the data to be classified. To obtain such a classifier
Hamiltonian, we further propose a training scheme based on quantum annealing
which is completely closed-off to the environment and which does not depend on
external measurements until the very end, avoiding unnecessary decoherence
during the annealing procedure. For a network of size n, the trained network
can be stored as a list of O(n) coupling strengths. We address the question of
which interactions are most suitable for a given classification task, and
develop a qubit-saving optimization for the training procedure on a simulated
annealing device. Furthermore, a small neural network to classify colors into
red vs. blue is trained and tested, and benchmarked against the annealing
parameters.

product of secular evolution processes at work in the inner regions of

and thought to be similar to low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. We aim at
testing the variety of observational diagnostics which are commonly adopted to
separate classical from disk-like bulges in nearby galaxies. We select a sample
of eight unbarred lenticular galaxies to be morphologically and kinematically
undisturbed with no evidence of other components than bulge and disk. We
analyze archival data of broad-band imaging from SDSS and integral-field
spectroscopy from the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ survey to derive the photometric and
kinematic properties, line-strength indices, and intrinsic shape of the sample
bulges. We argue that the bulge S\'ersic index is a poor diagnostics to
discriminate different bulge types. We find that the combination of
line-strength with either kinematic or photometric diagnostics does not provide
a clear separation for half of the sample bulges. We include for the first time
the intrinsic three-dimensional shape of bulges as a possible discriminant of
their nature. All bulges turn out to be thick oblate spheroids, but only one
has a flattening consistent with that expected for outer disks. We conclude
that bulge classification may be difficult even adopting all observational
diagnostics proposed so far and that classical and disk-like bulges could be
more confidently identified by considering their intrinsic shape.

have proven very successful, mimicking (or even improving) visual
classifications. However, these algorithms rely on large training samples of
labelled galaxies (typically thousands of them). A key question for using DL
classifications in future Big Data surveys is how much of the knowledge
acquired from an existing survey can be exported to a new dataset, i.e. if the
features learned by the machines are meaningful for different data. We test the
performance of DL models, trained with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, on
Dark Energy survey (DES) using images for a sample of $\sim$5000 galaxies with
a similar redshift distribution to SDSS. Applying the models directly to DES
data provides a reasonable global accuracy ($\sim$ 90%), but small completeness
and purity values. A fast domain adaptation step, consisting in a further
training with a small DES sample of galaxies ($\sim$500-300), is enough for
obtaining an accuracy > 95% and a significant improvement in the completeness
and purity values. This demonstrates that, once trained with a particular
dataset, machines can quickly adapt to new instrument characteristics (e.g.,
PSF, seeing, depth), reducing by almost one order of magnitude the necessary
training sample for morphological classification. Redshift evolution effects or
significant depth differences are not taken into account in this study.

21 massive clusters at 0.5<z<0.7, detected with the Planck satellite. We
measure the cluster galaxy stellar mass function (SMF), which is a fundamental
observable to study and constrain the formation and evolution of galaxies. Our
measurements are based on homogeneous and deep multi-band photometry spanning
u- to the Ks-band for each cluster and are supported by spectroscopic data from
different programs. The galaxy population is separated between quiescent and
star-forming galaxies based on their rest-frame U-V and V-J colours. The SMF is
compared to that of field galaxies at the same redshifts, using data from the
COSMOS/UltraVISTA survey. We find that the shape of the SMF of star-forming
galaxies does not depend on environment, while the SMF of quiescent galaxies
has a significantly steeper low-mass slope in the clusters compared to the
field. We estimate the environmental quenching efficiency (f_EQ), i.e. the
probability for a galaxy that would normally be star forming in the field, to
be quenched due to its environment. The f_EQ shows no stellar-mass dependence
in any environment, but it increases from 40% in the cluster outskirts to ~90%
in the cluster centres. The radial signature of f_EQ provides constraints on
where the dominant quenching mechanism operates in these clusters and on what
timescale. Exploring these using a simple model based on galaxy orbits obtained
from an N-body simulation, we find a clear degeneracy between both parameters.
For example, the quenching process may either be triggered on a long (~3 Gyr)
time scale at large radii (r~8R_500), or happen well within 1 Gyr at r<R_500.
The radius where quenching is triggered is at least r_quench> 0.67R_500
(95%CL). The ICM density at this location suggests that ram-pressure stripping
of the cold gas is a likely cause of quenching. [Abridged]

show that a useful paradigm for generating efficient selected CI/exact

presented here are fast and scalable, and we find that because they are built
on fast sorting algorithms they are more efficient than all other approaches we
considered. After introducing these techniques we present ASCI results applied
to a large range of systems and basis sets in order to demonstrate the types of
simulations that can be practically treated at the full-CI level with modern
methods and hardware, presenting double- and triple-zeta benchmark data for the
G1 dataset. The largest of these calculations is Si$_{2}$H$_{6}$ which is a

We combined spectral parameters from the GALAH survey with the Gaia DR2

clusters in more detail. We find that four of them (NGC 1252, NGC 6994, NGC
7772, NGC 7826) - originally classified in 1888 - are not clusters but are
instead chance projections on the sky. Member stars quoted in the literature
for these four clusters are unrelated in our multi-dimensional physical
parameter space; the published cluster properties are therefore irrelevant. We
confirm the existence of morphologically similar NGC 1901 for which we provide
a probabilistic membership analysis. An overdensity in three spatial dimensions
proves to be enough to reliably detect sparse clusters, but the whole
6-dimensional space must be used to identify members with high confidence, as
demonstrated in the case of NGC 1901.

cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of a disk galaxy that reproduces key
properties of the inner kiloparsecs of the MW: it has a boxy morphology and
shows an overall rotation and dispersion profile in agreement with
observations. We use a clustering algorithm on stellar kinematics to identify a
number of discrete kinematic components: a high- and low-spin disk, a stellar
halo and two bulge components; one fast rotating and one slow-rotating. We
focus on the two bulge components and show that the slow rotating one is
spherically symmetric while the fast rotating component shows a boxy/peanut
morphology. Although the two bulge components are kinematically discrete
populations at present-day, they are both mostly formed over similar time
scales, from disk material. We find that stellar particles with lower initial
birth angular momentum (most likely thick disc stars) end up in the
slow-rotating low-spin bulge, while stars with higher birth angular momentum
(most likely thin disc stars) are found in the high-spin bulge. This has the
important consequence that a bulge population with a spheroidal morphology does
not necessarily indicate a merger origin. In fact, we do find that only
$\sim2.3$\% of the stars in the bulge components are ex-situ stars brought in
by accreted dwarf galaxies early on. We identify these ex-situ stars as the

this work we focus on the small scales of the CMB angular power spectrum, which
are chiefly affected by noise and extragalactic foregrounds, such as point
sources. We adapt SMICA to use only cross-spectra between data maps, thus
avoiding the noise bias. In this study, performed both on simulations and on
Planck 2015 data, we fit for extragalactic point sources by modeling them as
shot noise of two independent populations. In simulations we correctly recover
the point source emission law, and obtain a CMB angular power spectrum that has
an average foreground residual of one fifth of the CMB power at $\ell \geq$
2200. On Planck data, the recovered point source emission law corresponds to
external estimates, with some offsets at the highest and lowest frequencies,
possibly due to frequency decoherence of point sources. The CMB angular power
spectrum residuals are consistent with what we find in simulations. The
cosmological parameters obtained from the simulations and the data show offsets
up to 1$\sigma$ on average from their expected values. Biases on cosmological
parameters in simulations represent the expected level of bias in Planck data.
The results on cosmological parameters depend on the detail of the foreground
residual contamination in the spectrum, and need a tailored modeling of the
likelihood foreground model.

easily probed by cosmic ray experiments. We explore models where the
semi-annihilation cross section is enhanced at late times and low temperatures
by the presence of an s-channel resonance near threshold. The relic density is
then sensitive to the evolution of the dark matter temperature, and we compute
expressions for the associated Boltzmann equation valid in general
semi-annihilating models. At late times, a self-heating effect warms the dark
matter, allowing number-changing processes to remain effective long after
kinetic decoupling of the dark and visible sectors. This allows the
semi-annihilation signal today to be enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude
over the thermal relic cross section. As a case study, we apply this to a dark
matter explanation of the positron excess seen by AMS-02. We see that unlike
annihilating dark matter, our model has no difficulty fitting the data while
also giving the correct relic density. However, constraints from the CMB and
$\gamma$-rays from the galactic centre do restrict the preferred regions of

on a small scale are typically determined by the method of representative
volumes: A sample of the random material is chosen - the representative volume
- and its effective properties are computed by the cell formula. Intuitively,
for a fixed sample size it should be possible to increase the accuracy of the
method by choosing a material sample which captures the statistical properties
of the material particularly well: For example, for a composite material
consisting of two constituents, one would select a representative volume in
which the volume fraction of the constituents matches closely with their volume
fraction in the overall material. Inspired by similar attempts in material
science, Le Bris, Legoll, and Minvielle have designed a selection approach for
representative volumes which performs remarkably well in numerical examples of
linear materials with moderate contrast. In the present work, we provide a
rigorous analysis of this selection approach for representative volumes in the
context of stochastic homogenization of linear elliptic equations. In
particular, we prove that the method essentially never performs worse than a
random selection of the material sample and may perform much better if the
selection criterion for the material samples is chosen suitably.

the excursion set (ES) approach are known to violate photon number conservation
at the few per cent level. In this work, we highlight a more severe, previously
unrecognized shortcoming of ES models: the large-scale 21 cm power spectrum
(equivalently, HI bias b_HI) is a relatively strong function of the spatial
resolution used to generate ES ionization maps. We trace this problem to the
fact that photon non-conservation in these models arises from a
resolution-dependent mixture of spatially resolved, photon non-conserving
bubbles, and partially ionized grid cells which are perfectly photon-conserving
by construction. We argue that this inevitably leads to a resolution-dependence
of b_HI, with the correct, converged value only emerging at very coarse
resolution. Quantitatively, we find that b_HI can be non-converged by as much
as ~20-25% in conservative ES implementations with grid sizes Delta x=5-10
cMpc/h, even when photon non-conservation is as small as ~3-4%. Thus, although
numerically efficient, ES ionization maps coarse enough to produce a converged
HI bias would wash out all topological features of the ionization field at
scales k>~0.05 h/cMpc. We therefore present a new, explicitly photon conserving
(PC) semi-numerical algorithm which distributes photons isotropically around
sources while also accounting for anisotropic overlaps between nearby bubbles.
Our PC algorithm predicts a resolution-independent value of b_HI consistent
with the result of low-resolution ES maps, thus serving as a useful compromise
between standard ES implementations and more expensive radiative transfer
simulations.

frustrated systems and metama- terials. Zero modes that exist in topological
matters are distinct from the ones arising from symmetry breaking.
Incidentally, a prominent aspect of frustrated systems and metamaterials also
is to harbor such kind of zero modes in form of an accidental degeneracy.
Taking cues from these two apparently different phenomena, we ask a simple
question: are the robust features of frustration topologically protected and if
so can we classify different types of frustration using topology? In answering
these questions we invoke the tools of topological mechanics to identify the
key agent at play, namely the rigidity matrix, which is a non-Hermitian matrix
and decides the topology of spin-wave zero modes in a frustrated magnet or
phonon modes in metamaterials. Further developments of the theory rely on
combining the recent developments in our understanding of Maxwell constraint
counting and generalizing the ten-fold way classification of Hermitian matrices
to non-Hermitian matrices. The result is a three-fold way classification for
each Maxwell counting index. We illustrate the clas- sification by
demonstrating the existence of a new vortex-like invariant for real rigidity
matrices using random matrices and through example frustrated spin models. So
by classifying all the rigidity matrices, we answer the question of the origin
of frustration (i.e. zero modes in the form of accidental degeneracy) in a wide
class of frustrated magnets and metamaterials by linking it to topological
invariants.

nearby luminous unobscured (type 1) AGN from the Close AGN Reference Survey
(CARS), which show intriguing kpc-scale arc-like features of extended [OIII]
ionized gas as mapped with VLT-MUSE. We aimed to detect hot gas bubbles that
would indicate the existence of powerful, galaxy-scale outflows in our targets,
HE 0227-0931 and HE 0351+0240, from deep (200 ks) Chandra observations.
Methods: By measuring the spatial and spectral properties of the extended X-ray
emission and comparing with the sub kpc-scale IFU data, we are able to
constrain feedback scenarios and directly test if the ionized gas is due to a
shocked wind. Results: No extended hot gas emission on kpc-scales was detected.
Unless the ambient medium density is low ($n_{H}\sim~1$ cm$^{-3}$ at 100 pc),
the inferred upper limits on the extended X-ray luminosities are well below
what is expected from theoretical models at matching AGN luminosities.
Conclusions: We conclude that the highly-ionized gas structures on kpc scales
are not inflated by a hot outflow in either target, and instead are likely
caused by photo-ionization of pre-existing gas streams of different origins.
Our non-detections suggest that extended X-ray emission from an AGN-driven wind
is not universal, and may lead to conflicts with current theoretical
predictions.

$\bar\nu_e$ in a water Cherenkov detector and/or the events due to
charged-current interactions of $\nu_e$ in an Argon detector. The ratio of

binding energy. We analyze these instabilities in both a linear perturbation
analysis and a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation. An unstable normal
mode of a differentially rotating star is detected by solving an eigenvalue
problem along the equatorial plane of the star. The physical mechanism of low
T/W dynamical instabilities is also qualitatively confirmed by a scattering of
sound waves between corotation and the surface caused by the corotation
barrier. Therefore, we can draw a picture of existing pulsation modes
unstabilized due to an amplified reflection of sound waves from the corotation
barrier. The feature in the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction of the unstable
mode in the linear analysis roughly agrees with that in the three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulation in Newtonian gravity. Moreover, the nature of the
eigenfunction that oscillates between corotation and the surface for an
unstable star requires reinterpretation of pulsation modes in differentially
rotating stars. Finally, we propose a manner by which to constrain the
stiffness of the equation of state by the direct detection of mode decomposed
gravitational waveforms.

  In fact, by the view of Laplace transform, the whole picture of Zeta function
is very clear and simple, and the problem can be greatly simplified. And by
Laplace transform, most integral and convolution operations can be converted
into algebraic operations, which greatly simplifies calculating and analysis.
This is a really and full new way to research Zeta function, prime numbers
distribution, RH and so on. In fact, many new, important and interesting
results can be reached by this new way, far more that shown in this paper.
  In September 2018, I had discussed with Sir Michael F Atiyah about RH and our
proofs, etc. Sir Atiyah was so nice and patient, and he gave my approach rather
positive evaluation. These email records are opened in page 14, as a memory of

additional potential. Following the proposal by Susskind
\cite{Susskind:2018tei}, we study the growth rate of the particle's Rindler
momentum, which corresponds to the growth rate of the operator size in the dual
chaotic system. A general analysis near the horizon shows that the growth rate
of the particle's Rindler momentum of the particle falling with a regular
potential is as the same as that of the particle free falling, which saturates
the chaos bound. However, when the potential is singular, the growth rate is
suppressed such that it is below the Lyapunov exponent. It implies that the
chaos suppression may be captured by an additional singular potential in the
gravity side. We further explicitly study a particle falling in hyperscaling
violating spacetime to confirm the general analysis results. Finally we study
the particle falling in AdS soliton geometry. It also exhibits a suppression of
the growth of the Rindler momentum. It is attributed to that when the repulsive
potential is introduced or the black hole horizon is absent, the particle is
slowed down and its trajectory seen by a comoving observer is timelike, which
corresponds a weak chaos system.

server platform, motivated by cloud computing applications. The VMs arrive
dynamically over time to the system, and require a certain amount of resources
(e.g. memory, CPU, etc) for the duration of their service. To avoid costly
preemptions, we consider non-preemptive scheduling: Each VM has to be assigned
to a server which has enough residual capacity to accommodate it, and once a VM
is assigned to a server, its service \textit{cannot} be disrupted (preempted).
Prior approaches to this problem either have high complexity, require
synchronization among the servers, or yield queue sizes/delays which are
excessively large. We propose a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that
resolves these issues. In general, given an approximation algorithm to Knapsack
with approximation ratio $r$, our scheduling algorithm can provide $r\beta$
fraction of the throughput region for $\beta < r$. In the special case of a
greedy approximation algorithm to Knapsack, we further show that this condition
can be relaxed to $\beta<1$. The parameters $\beta$ and $r$ can be tuned to
provide a tradeoff between achievable throughput, delay, and computational
complexity of the scheduling algorithm. Finally extensive simulation results
using both synthetic and real traffic traces are presented to verify the
performance of our algorithm.

in Li$ _{3}$N with a total magnetic moment of 1.0 $\mu_{\rm B}$ which arises
mainly due to partially occupied N-$p$-orbitals around the Li vacancies. The
defect formation energies dictate that Li-II vacancy, which is in the Li$

The electronic structures of Li-vacancies show half-metallic behavior. On the
other hand N-vacancy does not induce magnetism and has a larger formation
energy than Li-vacancies. N vacancy derived bands at the Fermi energy are
mainly contributed by the Li atoms. Carbon is also doped at Li-I and Li-II
sites, and it is expected that doping C at Li-I site is thermodynamically more
stable as compared with Li-II site. Carbon can induce metallicity with zero
magnetic moment when doped at Li-I site, whereas magnetism is observed when
Li-II site is occupied by the C impurity atom and C-driven magnetism is spread
over the N atoms as well. Carbon can also induce half-metallic magnetism when
doped at N site in Li$ _{3}$N, and has a smaller defect formation energy as

chemical composition of stars belonging to the extreme He-rich population
populated by stars with the most extreme abundance of Mg, Al, Na, O and Si. We
checked whether the most recent measures are consistent with the AGB yields of
stars of $6.5-8~M_{\odot}$. These stars evolve on time scales of the order of
40-60 Myr and eject matter strongly enriched in helium, owing to a deep
penetration of the surface convective zone down to regions touched by CNO
nucleosynthesis occurring after the core He-burning phase. Since the big
unknown of the AGB phase of massive stars is the mass loss, we propose a new
approch that takes into account the effects of the radiation pressure on dust
particles. We show that this more realistic description is able to reproduce
the observed abundances of Mg, Al, Na and Si in these extreme stars. The large
spread in the oxygen abundances is explained by invoking deep mixing during the
RGB phase. It will be possible to check this work hypothesis as soon as the
oxygen measurements of the main sequence stars of NGC2808 will be available.

view of SOHO CDS. The jet with the most suitable spatial and temporal coverage
is analyzed in detail. Results. Two enhanced (non-thermal) line broadenings are
observed in the cooler chromospheric / transition-region lines and they are
localized near the site where the closed magnetic loops reconnect with the open
magnetic field lines. Both enhanced broadenings are found in the sites with
redshifts in the lines, surrounded by the region with blueshifts. One enhanced
line broadening is associated with a small flare without energetic particle
signatures while another occurs just after the particle acceleration signatures

appears to be not directly related to the energetic ion production and motions.
Further investigations where the critical impulsive phase of the flare is

grid frequency through a hypothesis test which decides whether there is no

The hypothesis testing incurs miss-classification errors---false alarms (i.e.,
there is no deviation but we declare a positive/negative deviation), and missed
detections (i.e., there is a positive/negative deviation but we declare no
deviation). Therefore, to improve further upon the performance of the
hypothesis test, we represent the grid frequency's fluctuations over time as a
discrete-time hidden Markov model (HMM). We note that the outcomes of the
hypothesis test are actually the emitted symbols, which are related to the true
states via emission probability matrix. We then estimate the hidden Markov
sequence (the true values of the grid frequency) via maximum likelihood method
by passing the observed/emitted symbols through the Viterbi decoder.
Simulations results show that the mean accuracy of Viterbi algorithm is at

numerically using the finite element method. For solid shapes, this requires a
volumetric discretization, such as a boundary conforming tetrahedral mesh.
Unfortunately, tetrahedral meshing remains an open challenge and existing
methods either struggle to conform to complex boundary surfaces or require
manual intervention to prevent failure. Rather than create a single volumetric
mesh for the entire shape, we advocate for solid geometry processing on
deconstructed domains, where a large and complex shape is composed of
overlapping solid subdomains. As each smaller and simpler part is now easier to
tetrahedralize, the question becomes how to account for overlaps during problem
modeling and how to couple solutions on each subdomain together algebraically.
We explore how and why previous coupling methods fail, and propose a method
that couples solid domains only along their boundary surfaces. We demonstrate
the superiority of this method through empirical convergence tests and
qualitative applications to solid geometry processing on a variety of popular

that the number of users can possibly exceed the number of channels, and that
rewards can be non-zero even under collisions. The proposed algorithm consists
of an estimation phase and an allocation phase. It is shown that if every user
adopts the algorithm, the system wide regret is constant with time with high
probability. The regret guarantees hold for any number of users and channels,
in particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of

resolution mechanism to achieve sub-linear regret. It is shown that if every

$O(T^\frac{3}{4})$ over a horizon of time $T$. The algorithms in both

because of the immense stellar irradiation which they receive. The extreme
energy input leads to the expansion of the atmosphere and the escape of neutral
hydrogen. A particularly intriguing case among the hot giant planets is KELT-9b
-- an exoplanet orbiting very close to an early A-type star with the highest
temperature (~4600 K at day-side) among all the exoplanets known so far. The
atmospheric composition and dynamic of such a unique planet have been unknown.
Here we report the first detection of an extended hot hydrogen atmosphere
around KELT-9b. The detection was achieved by measuring the atomic hydrogen
absorption during transit with the Balmer H{\alpha} line, which is unusually
strong mainly due to the high level of extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the
star. We detected a significant wavelength shift of the H{\alpha} absorption
which is mostly attributed to the planetary orbital motion. The obtained
transmission spectrum has a significant line contrast (1.15% extra absorption
at the H{\alpha} line centre). The observation implies that the effective
radius at the H{\alpha} line centre is ~1.64 times the size of the planetary
radius, indicating the planet has a largely extended hydrogen envelope close to
the size of the Roche lobe (1.91 Rplanet) and is probably undergoing dramatic
atmosphere escape.

space-based telescopes, to increase the collecting area and the angular
resolution. These large telescopes will necessarily use segmented primaries to
fit in a rocket. However, these massively segmented mirrors make high-contrast
performance very difficult to achieve and stabilize, compared to more common
monolithic primaries. Despite space telescopes operating in a friendlier
environment than ground-based telescopes, remaining vibrations and resonant
modes on the segments can still deteriorate the performance. In this context,
we present the Pair-based Analytical model for Segmented Telescopes Imaging
from Space (PASTIS) that enables the establishment of a comprehensive error
budget, both in term of segment alignment and stability. Using this model, one
may evaluate the influence of the segment cophasing and surface quality
evolution on the final images and contrasts, and set up requirements for any
given mission. One can also identify the dominant modes of a given geometry for
a given coronagraphic instrument and design the feedback control systems
accordingly. In this paper, we first develop and validate this analytical model
by comparing its outputs to the images and contrasts predicted by an end-to-end
simulation. We show that the contrasts predicted using PASTIS are accurate
enough compared to the end-to-end propagation results, at the exo-Earth
detection level. Second, we develop a method for a fast and efficient error
budget in term of segment manufacturing and alignment that takes into account
the disparities of the segment effects on the final performance. This technique
is then applied on a specific aperture to provide static and quasi-static
requirements on each segment for local aberrations. Finally we discuss
potential application of this new technique to future missions.

the pseudogap phase transition in the hole-doped materials. Doped cuprates have
negative charge-transfer gaps, just as rare earth nickelates and BaBiO$_3$.
Because of strong correlations and small $d-p$ electron hoppings the systems
behave as effective $\frac{1}{2}$-filled Cu-band in the undoped state, and as
correlated two-dimensional geometrically frustrated nearly $\frac{1}{4}$-filled
O-band in the doped state. The theory gives the simplest yet most comprehensive
understanding of experiments in the normal states. The robust
antiferromagnetism in the conventional T$^\prime$ crystals, the strong role of
oxygen deficiency in driving superconductivity and charge carrier sign
corresponding to holes at optimal doping are all manifestations of the same
quantum state. In the hole-doped pseudogapped state, a biaxial commensurate
period 4 charge density wave state of O$^{1-}$-Cu$^{1+}$-O$^{1-}$ spin-singlets
coexists with broken rotational C$_4$ symmetry. Finite domains of this broken
symmetry state will exhibit the polar Kerr effect. Superconductivity within the

Wigner crystal [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 93}, 165110 and {\bf 93}, 205111]. We posit
that a similar valence transition, Ir$^{4+} \to$ Ir$^{3+}$, occurs in
electron-doped SrIr$_2$O$_4$. We make testable theoretical predictions on
cuprates and iridates. Finally, we note that there exist an unusually large
number of unconventional superconductors that exhibit superconductivity
proximate to exotic charge ordered states, whose bandfillings are also
$\frac{1}{4}$, exactly where the paired Wigner crystal is most stable.

origin and persistence issue of spiral structure in disk galaxies through
theoretical modeling and numerical calculations. These studies have been
carried out under two well-known paradigm for generation of spiral arms,
namely, the density wave theory and the small-scale material arm generated by
swing amplification. The basic theoretical model of the galactic disk used
involves gravitationally-coupled two-component system (stars and gas) embedded
in a rigid and non-responsive dark matter halo. The first part of the thesis
involves searching for the dynamical effect of dark matter halo on small-scale
spiral structure in dwarf low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and also some
dwarf irregular galaxies which host an extended HI disk. In both cases, the
rotation curves are found to be dominated by the contribution of the dark
matter halo over a large radial distance, starting from the inner regions of
the galaxies. The next part of the thesis deals with the investigation of the
possible effect of the interstellar gas on the persistence issue and the
pattern speeds of the spiral structure in the disk galaxies. The last part of
the thesis involves in studying the dynamical effect of dark matter halo on
large-scale spiral structure. As shown in this thesis, the dark matter halo and
the interstellar have opposite dynamical effects on the origin and persistence
issue of the spiral arms. The dark matter halo suppresses both small-scale and
large-scale spiral instability in those disk galaxies which are dynamically
dominated by dark matter halo from the very innermost regions. On the other
hand, the interstellar gas helps the spiral arms to survive for a longer
time-scale (several billion year).

from problems of poor thermal and chemical stability accompanied by significant
dissipative losses under high-temperature conditions. In this regard,
semiconductor nanoparticles have attracted attention with their promising
characteristics of highly tunable plasmonic resonances, low ohmic losses and
greater thermochemical stability. Here, we investigate the size-dependent
thermoplasmonic properties of semiconducting silicon and gallium arsenide
nanoparticles to compare them with metallic Au nanoparticles using Mie theory.
To this end, we employ experimentally estimated models of dielectric
permittivity in our computations. Among the various permittivity models for Au,
we further compare the Drude-Lorentz (DL) and the Drude and critical points
(DCP) models. Results show a redshift in the scattering and absorption
resonances for the DL model while the DCP model presents a blueshift. The
dissipative damping in the semiconductor nanoparticles is strongest for the
sharp electric octupole resonances followed by the quadrupole and dipole modes.
However, a reverse order with strongest values for the broad dipole resonance
is observed for the Au nanoparticles. A massive Drude broadening contributes
strongly to the damping of resonances in Au nanoparticles at elevated
temperatures. In contrast, the semiconductor nanoparticles do not exhibit any
significant deterioration in their scattering and absorption resonances at high
temperatures. In combination with low dissipative damping, this makes the
semiconductor nanoparticles better suited for high-temperature applications in
nanoplasmonics wherein the noble metals suffer from excessive heating.

the time-dependence of the multi-output responses. In this paper, we propose a
deep convolutional encoder-decoder neural network methodology to tackle these
issues. The surrogate modeling task is transformed to an image-to-image
regression strategy. This approach extracts high-level coarse features from the
high-dimensional input permeability images using an encoder, and then refines
the coarse features to provide the output pressure/saturation images through a
decoder. A training strategy combining a regression loss and a segmentation
loss is proposed in order to better approximate the discontinuous saturation
field. To characterize the high-dimensional time-dependent outputs of the
dynamic system, time is treated as an additional input to the network that is
trained using pairs of input realizations and of the corresponding system
outputs at a limited number of time instances. The proposed method is evaluated
using a geological carbon storage process-based multiphase flow model with a
2500-dimensional stochastic permeability field. With a relatively small number
of training data, the surrogate model is capable of accurately characterizing
the spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure and discontinuous CO2 saturation
fields and can be used efficiently to compute the statistics of the system

nanomechanical systems have coexisting stable states of forced vibrations in a
certain range of the amplitude of the driving force. Depending on its phase,
which encodes binary information, a signal at the same frequency increases or
decreases the force amplitude. The resulting force amplitude can be outside the
range of bistability. The values of the mode amplitude differ significantly on
the opposite sides of the bistability region. Therefore the mode amplitude is
very sensitive to the signal phase. This suggests using a driven mode as a
bi-directional bifurcation amplifier, which switches in the opposite directions
depending on the signal phase and provides an essentially digital output. We
study the operation of the amplifier near the critical point where the width of
the bistability region goes to zero and thus the threshold of the signal
amplitude is low. We also develop an analytical technique and study the error
rate near the threshold. The results apply to a broad range of currently

inflationary models (natural, monodromy, Starobinsky) and connect different

eigenvector (or ""spike"") is planted into a random matrix. These distributions
form natural statistical models for principal component analysis (PCA) problems
throughout the sciences. Baik, Ben Arous and Peche showed that the spiked
Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp phase transition asymptotically: when the
spike strength is above a critical threshold, it is possible to detect the
presence of a spike based on the top eigenvalue, and below the threshold the
top eigenvalue provides no information. Such results form the basis of our
understanding of when PCA can detect a low-rank signal in the presence of
noise. However, under structural assumptions on the spike, not all information
is necessarily contained in the spectrum. We study the statistical limits of
tests for the presence of a spike, including non-spectral tests. Our results
leverage Le Cam's notion of contiguity, and include:
  i) For the Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA achieves the optimal
detection threshold for certain natural priors for the spike.
  ii) For any non-Gaussian Wigner ensemble, PCA is sub-optimal for detection.
However, an efficient variant of PCA achieves the optimal threshold (for
natural priors) by pre-transforming the matrix entries.

positive spikes (for natural priors) but this is not always the case for
negative spikes.

established examples of topological physics, however, do not exhaust all
possible topological phases, and recently a new class of topological
metamaterials characterized by bulk polarization has been introduced. In
addition to edge conduction, these systems have been shown to host higher-order
topological modes. Here, we introduce and measure topological bulk polarization
in 3D printed two-dimensional acoustic meta-structures, and observe topological
transitions as the design parameters are tuned. We also demonstrate that our
topological meta-structure hosts both 1D edge and higher-order 0D corner states
with unique acoustic properties. The edge states have spin polarization that
reverses for opposite propagation direction, thus supporting directional
excitation. Corner states are pinned to the meta-structure corners, and rapidly
decay both along the edges and into the bulk. Interestingly, these 0D states
can spectrally overlap with the continuum of bulk states, but are not
compatible with radiation, thus enabling embedded topological eigenstates
within the continuum of bulk modes. Their confinement and inherent topological
robustness is experimentally confirmed by deliberately introducing disorder.
Our findings open new directions in acoustics for advanced sound propagation
and manipulation.

away, crumpling dynamics are often considered a paradigm of complexity. This
complexity arises from the infinite number of configurations a disordered
crumpled sheet can take. Here we experimentally show that key aspects of
crumpling have a very simple description; the evolution of the damage in
crumpling dynamics can largely be described by a single global quantity, the
total length of all creases. We follow the evolution of the damage network in
repetitively crumpled elastoplastic sheets, and show that the dynamics of this
quantity are deterministic, and depend only on the instantaneous state of the
crease network and not at all on the crumpling history. We also show that this
global quantity captures the crumpling dynamics of a sheet crumpled for the
first time. This leads to a remarkable reduction in complexity, allowing a
description of a highly disordered system by a single state parameter. Similar
strategies may also be useful in analyzing other systems that evolve under
geometric and mechanical constraints, from faulting of tectonic plates to the
evolution of proteins.

loading and experimental zones and associated vacuum infrastructure design. The
experimental-zone trap electrodes are designed for wide-angle optical access
(e.g. for lasers used to engineer spin-motional coupling across large ion
crystals) while simultaneously providing a harmonic trapping potential. We
describe a near-zero-loss liquid-cryogen-based superconducting magnet, employed

equipped with a dual-stage remote-motor LN2LHe recondenser. Experimental
measurements using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe demonstrate

discernible effect on the measured NMR linewidth from pulse-tube operation.
Next we describe a custom-engineered inbore optomechanical system which
delivers ultraviolet (UV) laser light to the trap, and supports multiple
aligned optical objectives for top- and sideview imaging in the experimental
trap region. We describe design choices including the use of non-magnetic
goniometers and translation stages for precision alignment. Further, the
optomechanical system integrates UV-compatible fiber optics which decouple the
system's alignment from remote light sources. Using this system we present

topological insulator represent one of possible venues to engineer topological
phases, yet they have been so far largely restricted to temporal modulation of

a model-independent way. Using the dimension-6 bag parameters recently
determined from HQET sum rules and the vacuum insertion approximation for meson
matrix elements of dimension-7 operators, the calculated $B$ meson lifetime

evaluation of baryon matrix elements, the resulting baryon lifetime ratios

to the bottom hadron sector where the HQE in $1/m_b$ works well, the HQE to

learned from long-term 3D Lidar data. Most existing semantic mapping approaches
focus on improving semantic understanding of single frames, rather than 3D
refinement of semantic maps (i.e. fusing semantic observations). The most
widely-used approach for 3D semantic map refinement is a Bayesian update, which
fuses the consecutive predictive probabilities following a Markov-Chain model.
Instead, we propose a learning approach to fuse the semantic features, rather
than simply fusing predictions from a classifier. In our approach, we represent
and maintain our 3D map as an OctoMap, and model each cell as a recurrent
neural network (RNN), to obtain a Recurrent-OctoMap. In this case, the semantic
mapping process can be formulated as a sequence-to-sequence encoding-decoding
problem. Moreover, in order to extend the duration of observations in our
Recurrent-OctoMap, we developed a robust 3D localization and mapping system for
successively mapping a dynamic environment using more than two weeks of data,
and the system can be trained and deployed with arbitrary memory length. We
validate our approach on the ETH long-term 3D Lidar dataset [1]. The
experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the

and efficiency of quantum heat engines, it becomes a relevant question if there
are any theoretical limits to their application. We argue that quantum
fluctuations in the control device which implements the shortcut deflect the
system from the adiabatic path. This not only induces transitions to unwanted
final states but also changes the system energy, so that using the STA has a
definite cost in terms of conventional work definitions. This may be the
ultimate cost of an adiabatic shortcut, in the sense that it is present even
for a frictionless, zero temperature driving. We estimate the effect, to lowest
nontrivial order in the derivatives of the time-dependent frequency, on a
parametric harmonic oscillator, thus providing a consistency condition for the
validity of the classical approximation.

Formally, we prove that the multivariate generating polynomial of the bases of
any matroid is log-concave as a function over the positive orthant. For the
second ingredient, we develop a general framework for approximate counting in
discrete problems, based on convex optimization. The connection goes through
subadditivity of the entropy. For matroids, we prove that an approximate
superadditivity of the entropy holds by relying on the log-concavity of the

decades, and it becomes increasingly important in the Big Data era as there are
usually hundreds of variables available in a dataset. To enhance
interpretability of a model, identifying potentially relevant features is often
a step before fitting all the features into a regression model. A good variable
selection method should effectively control the fraction of false discoveries
and ensure large enough power of its selection set. In a lot of contemporary
data applications, a great portion of features are coded as binary variables.
Binary features are widespread in many fields, from online controlled
experiments to genome science to physical statistics. Although there has
recently been a handful of literature for provable false discovery rate (FDR)
control in variable selection, most of the theoretical analyses were based on
some strong dependency assumption or Gaussian assumption among features. In
this paper we propose a variable selection method in regression framework for
selecting binary features. Under mild conditions, we show that FDR is
controlled exactly under a target level in a finite sample if the underlying
distribution of the binary features is known. We show in simulations that FDR
control is still attained when feature distribution is estimated from data. We
also provide theoretical results on the power of our variables selection method
in a linear regression model or a logistic regression model. In the restricted
settings where competitors exist, we show in simulations and real data
application on a HIV antiretroviral therapy dataset that our method has higher
power than the competitor.

metal compounds with this structure. It is found that (Mn,Fe,Co)-based
compounds all have a G-type antiferromagnetic(AFM) insulating ground state
while Ni-based compounds are paramagnetic metal. The AFM interaction is the
largest in the Co-based compounds as the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals all strongly
participate in AFM superexchange interactions. The abrupt quenching of the
magnetism from the Co to Ni-based compounds is very similar to those from Fe to
Co-based pnictides in which a C-type AFM state appears in the Fe-based ones but
vanishes in the Co-based ones. This behavior can be considered as an electronic
signature of the high-$T_c$ gene. Upon doping, as we predicted before, this

apply these approaches to massive text corpora, the vocabulary needs to be
reduced considerably and large computer clusters and/or GPUs are typically
required. Moreover, the number of topics must be provided beforehand but this
depends on the corpus characteristics and it is often difficult to estimate,
especially for massive text corpora. Unfortunately, both topic quality and time
complexity are sensitive to this choice. This paper describes an alternative
approach to discover topics based on Min-Hashing, which can handle massive text
corpora and large vocabularies using modest computer hardware and does not
require to fix the number of topics in advance. The basic idea is to generate
multiple random partitions of the corpus vocabulary to find sets of highly
co-occurring words, which are then clustered to produce the final topics. In
contrast to probabilistic topic models where topics are distributions over the
complete vocabulary, the topics discovered by the proposed approach are sets of
highly co-occurring words. Interestingly, these topics underlie various
thematics with different levels of granularity. An extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluation using the 20 Newsgroups (18K), Reuters (800K), Spanish
Wikipedia (1M), and English Wikipedia (5M) corpora shows that the proposed
approach is able to consistently discover meaningful and coherent topics.
Remarkably, the time complexity of the proposed approach is linear with respect
to corpus and vocabulary size; a non-parallel implementation was able to
discover topics from the entire English edition of Wikipedia with over 5
million documents and 1 million words in less than 7 hours.

to learn structures of MRFs: methods based on parameter learning and those
based on independence test. The former methods more or less assume certain
forms of distribution, so they potentially perform poorly when the assumption
is not satisfied. The latter can learn an MRF structure without a strong
distributional assumption, but sometimes it is unclear what objective function
is maximized/minimized in these methods. In this paper, we follow the latter,

maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE) with respect to the edge set. As a
result, the proposed solution successfully deals with the {\em symmetricity} in

in highly sensitive detection based on qubits for various external fields such

investigated the effects of finite-width pulses in the sequences on AC
magnetometry utilizing nitrogen-vacancy centers in an isotopically-controlled

optimum time to acquire the largest phase accumulation due to the sensing field
from that expected by filter functions neglecting the pulse widths, even if the
widths are considerably shorter than the time period of the sensing field.
Moreover, we experimentally demonstrated that the deviation can be corrected by

great potential in a variety of applications. As these robots grow more
popular, it is essential to continuously evaluate the dynamics of the
human-robot relationship. One factor shown to have potential impacts on this
critical relationship is the human projection of stereotypes onto social
robots, a practice that is implicitly known to effect both developers and users
of this technology. As such, in this research, we wished to investigate the
difference in participants' perceptions of the robot interaction if we removed
stereotype priming. This has not yet been a common practice in similar studies.
Given the stereotypes of emotions among ethnic groups, especially in the U.S.,
this study specifically sought to investigate the impact that robot ""skin
color"" could potentially have on the human perception of a robot's emotional
expressive behavior. A between-subject experiment with 198 individuals was
conducted. The results showed no significant differences in the overall emotion
classification or intensity ratings for the different robot skin colors. These
results lend credence to our hypothesis that when individuals are not primed
with information related to human stereotypes, robots are evaluated based on
functional attributes versus stereotypical attributes. This provides some
confidence that robots, if designed correctly, can potentially be used as a
tool to override stereotype-based biases associated with human behavior.

diffraction and energy focusing, a well-known characteristic of basin effects.
In this research, we study the role of basin effects in the mainshock ground
motion data recorded at the Kathmandu basin, Nepal during the 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha

unusual low frequency reverberating pulse that appeared systematically across
the basin, and the unexpected depletion of the ground surface motions from high
frequency components, especially away from the basin edges. In order to do that
we study the response of a 2D cross section of Kathmandu basin subjected to
vertically propagating plane SV waves. Despite the scarcity of geotechnical
information and of strong ground motion recordings, we show that an idealized
plane-strain elastic model with a simplified layered velocity structure can
capture surprisingly well the low frequency components of the basin ground
response. We finally couple the 2D elastic simulation with a 1D nonlinear
analysis of the shallow basin sediments. The 1D nonlinear approximation shows
improved performance over a larger frequency range relative to the first order
approximation of a 2D elastic layered basin response.

using a moving window, and therefore finding the interval between the dominant
J-peaks of ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal. However, this approach has many
limitations due to the nonlinear and nonstationary behavior of the BCG signal.
This is because the BCG signal does not display consistent J-peaks, which can
usually be the case for overnight, in-home monitoring, particularly with frail
elderly. Additionally, its accuracy will be undoubtedly affected by motion
artifacts. Second, frequency-domain algorithms do not provide information about
interbeat intervals. Nevertheless, they can provide information about heart
rate variability. This is usually done by taking the fast Fourier transform or
the inverse Fourier transform of the logarithm of the estimated spectrum, i.e.,
cepstrum of the signal using a sliding window. Thereafter, the dominant
frequency is obtained in a particular frequency range. The limit of these
algorithms is that the peak in the spectrum may get wider and multiple peaks
may appear, which might cause a problem in measuring the vital signs. At last,
the objective of wavelet-domain algorithms is to decompose the signal into
different components, hence the component which shows an agreement with the
vital signs can be selected i.e., the selected component contains only
information about the heart cycles or respiratory cycles, respectively. An
empirical mode decomposition is an alternative approach to wavelet
decomposition, and it is also a very suitable approach to cope with nonlinear
and nonstationary signals such as cardiorespiratory signals. Apart from the
above-mentioned algorithms, machine learning approaches have been implemented
for measuring heartbeats. However, manual labeling of training data is a
restricting property.

seen in conventional inorganic semiconductor devices. Significant inroads have
been made into understanding this fact in terms of rapid ion migration, now a
well-established property of the prototype photovoltaic perovskite MAPbI$_3$
and strongly implicated in the newer mixed compositions. Here we study the
manifestations of ion migration in frequency-domain small-signal measurements,
focusing on the popular technique of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).
We provide new interpretations for a variety of previously puzzling features,
including giant photo-induced low-frequency capacitance and negative
capacitance in a variety of forms. We show that these apparently strange
measurements can be rationalized by the splitting of AC current into two
components, one associated with charge-storage, and the other with the
quasi-steady-state recombination current of electrons and holes. The latter
contribution to the capacitance can take either a positive or a negative sign,
and is potentially very large when slow, voltage-sensitive processes such as
ion migration are at play. Using numerical drift-diffusion semiconductor
models, we show that giant photo-induced capacitance, inductive loop features,
and low-frequency negative capacitance all emerge naturally as consequences of
ion migration via its coupling to quasi-steady-state electron and hole
currents. In doing so, we unify the understanding of EIS measurements with the
comparably well-developed theory of rate dependent current-voltage (I-V)
measurements in perovskite cells. Comparing the two techniques, we argue that
EIS is more suitable for quantifying I-V hysteresis than conventional methods
based on I-V sweeps, and demonstrate this application on a variety of cell
types.

area is blocked or hidden from the CNN model, it will pay attention to
alternative image regions, while still attempting to make correct predictions.
However, the model requires to be properly constrained during AM, otherwise, it
may overfit to uncorrelated image parts and forget the valuable knowledge that
it has learned from the original image classification task. To alleviate such
side effects, we then design a knowledge preservation (KP) loss, which
minimizes the discrepancy between responses for X-ray images from the original
and the updated networks. Furthermore, we modify the CNN model to include
multi-scale aggregation (MSA), improving its localization ability on
small-scale disease findings, e.g., lung nodules. We experimentally validate
our method on the publicly-available ChestX-ray14 dataset, outperforming a

fluctuations associated with the change in incoming waves (""wave-to-wave""
fluctuations) exhibit a new kind of universalities, which does not exist in
conventional mesoscopic fluctuations associated with the change in disorder
realizations (""sample-to-sample"" fluctuations), and originate from the
coherence between the natural channels of waves -- the transmission
eigenchannels. Using the results obtained for wave-to-wave fluctuations, we
find the criterion for almost all stationary scattering states to exhibit the
same spatial structure such as the diffusive steady state. We further show that
the expectations of observables at stationary scattering states are independent
of incoming waves and given by their averages with respect to eigenchannels.
This suggests the possibility of extending the studies of thermalization of
closed systems to open systems, which provides new perspectives for the
emergence of nonequilibrium statistical phenomena.

terms of the order of the centralizer of an involution t in G. We consider
variants of these themes. We first note that for an arbitrary finite group G of
even order, we have |G| is less than the number of conjugacy classes of the
Fitting subgroup times the order of the centralizer to the fourth power of any
involution in G.
  This result does require the classification of the finite simple groups. The
groups SL(2,q) with q even shows that the exponent 4 cannot be replaced by any
exponent less than 3. We do not know at present whether the exponent 4 can be
improved in general, though we note that the exponent 3 suffices for almost
simple groups G.
  We are however able to prove that every finite group $G$ of even order
contains an involution u such that [G:F(G)] is less than the cube of the order
of the centralizer of u. There is a dichotomy in the proof of this fact, as it
reduces to proving two residual cases: one in which G is almost simple (where
the classification of the finite simple groups is needed) and one when G has a
Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. For the latter result, the classification of
finite simple groups is not needed (though the Feit-Thompson odd order theorem
is).
  We also prove a very general result on fixed point spaces of involutions in
finite irreducible linear groups which does not make use of the classification
of the finite simple groups, and some other results on the existence of
non-central elements (not necessarily involutions) with large centralizers in
general finite groups. We also show (without the classification of finite
simple groups) that if t is an involution in G and p is a prime divisor of
[G:F(G)], then p is at most 1 plus the order of the centralizer of t (and this
is best possible).

approach to improve the precision of facial landmark detectors on both images
and video. Our key observation is that the detections of the same landmark in
adjacent frames should be coherent with registration, i.e., optical flow.
Interestingly, the coherency of optical flow is a source of supervision that
does not require manual labeling, and can be leveraged during detector
training. For example, we can enforce in the training loss function that a
detected landmark at frame$_{t-1}$ followed by optical flow tracking from
frame$_{t-1}$ to frame$_t$ should coincide with the location of the detection
at frame$_t$. Essentially, supervision-by-registration augments the training
loss function with a registration loss, thus training the detector to have
output that is not only close to the annotations in labeled images, but also
consistent with registration on large amounts of unlabeled videos. End-to-end
training with the registration loss is made possible by a differentiable
Lucas-Kanade operation, which computes optical flow registration in the forward
pass, and back-propagates gradients that encourage temporal coherency in the
detector. The output of our method is a more precise image-based facial
landmark detector, which can be applied to single images or video. With
supervision-by-registration, we demonstrate (1) improvements in facial landmark
detection on both images (300W, ALFW) and video (300VW, Youtube-Celebrities),
and (2) significant reduction of jittering in video detections.

about the confidentiality of their runtime data, which are supposed to be
processed on third-party's compute infrastructures. Information disclosure of
user-supplied data may jeopardize users' privacy and breach increasingly
stringent data protection regulations. In this paper, we systematically
investigate the life cycles of inference inputs in deep learning image
classification pipelines and understand how the information could be leaked.
Based on the discovered insights, we develop a Ternary Model Partitioning
mechanism and bring trusted execution environments to mitigate the identified
information leakages. Our research prototype consists of two co-operative
components: (1) Model Assessment Framework, a local model evaluation and
partitioning tool that assists cloud users in deployment preparation; (2)
Infenclave, an enclave-based model serving system for online confidential

that the neat continuum relation breaks down and develops corrections due to
the broken rotational symmetry. In the process, we introduce a new, quantum
mechanical derivation of the finite-wavevector Hall conductivity for the

universal formalism for studying quantum Hall physics on a lattice, and find
that at weak applied magnetic fields, generic lattice wavefunctions connect
smoothly to the Landau levels of the continuum. At moderate field strengths,
the lattice corrections can be significant and perturb the wavefunctions,
energy levels, and transport properties from their continuum values. Our
approach allows the finite-field behaviour of a system to be inferred directly

However, this benefit comes with high computational costs; structure learning

repeated optimization of clause weights. In this paper, we propose the first

skillfully integrates features of each part to achieve more expressive

sequences which include the information of head, waist, legs and so on. Then
the features are extracted by STFMM whose $2N$ inputs are obtained from the
developed Siamese network, and these features are combined into a
discriminative representation for one person. Experiments are conducted on the

experiments to cause bipolar cancellation (BPC). This unusual cell response
occurs if a first pulse is followed by a second pulse with opposite polarity.
Possibly universal, BPC presently lacks a mechanistic explanation. Multiple
versions of the ""standard model"" of cell electroporation (EP) fail to account
for BPC. Here we show, for the first time, how an extension of the standard
model can account for a key experimental observation that essentially defines
BPC: the amount of a tracer that enters a cell, and how tracer influx can be
decreased by the second part of a bipolar pulse. The extended model can also
account for the recovery of BPC wherein the extent of BPC is diminished if the
spacing between the first and second pulses is increased. Our approach is
reverse engineering, meaning that we identify and introduce an additional
biophysical mechanism that allows pore transport to change. We hypothesize that
occluding molecules from outside the membrane enter or relocate within a pore.
Significantly, the additional mechanism is fundamental and general, involving a
combination of partitioning and hindrance. Molecules near the membrane can
enter pores to block transport of tracer molecules while still passing small
ions (+/- 1) that govern electrical behavior. Accounting for such behavior
requires an extension of the standard model.

In this paper, a four-stage video understanding pipeline is presented to

graph-based knowledge representation network as prior reference. Two deep
networks are trained to identify objects and motions in each video sequence
associated with an action. Low Level image features are then used to identify
objects of interest in that video sequence. Confidence scores are assigned to
objects of interest based on their involvement in the action and to motion
classes based on results from a deep neural network that classifies the
on-going action in video into motion classes. Confidence scores are computed
for each candidate functional unit associated with an action using a knowledge
representation network, object confidences, and motion confidences. Each action
is therefore associated with a functional unit and the sequence of actions is
further evaluated to identify the single on-going activity in the video. The
knowledge representation used in the pipeline is called the functional
object-oriented network which is a graph-based network useful for encoding
knowledge about manipulation tasks. Experiments are performed on a dataset of
cooking videos to test the proposed algorithm with action inference and

$^{62}$Ni and $^{64}$Ni are analyzed phenomenologically employing an optical
potential model and the first order collective model in the relativistic Dirac
coupled channel formalism. The Dirac equations are reduced to the
Schr\""{o}dinger-like second-order differential equations and the effective
central and spin-orbit optical potentials are analyzed by considering mass
number dependence. The multistep excitation via $2^+$ state is found to be
important for the $4^+$ state excitation in the ground state rotational band at
the proton inelastic scatterings from the Ni isotopes. The calculated
deformation parameters for the 2$^+$, the 4$^+$ states of the ground state
rotational band and the first 3$^-$ state are found to agree pretty well with
those obtained in the nonrelativistic calculations.

during the period from 2016 August 11 to 12. Combining the observations of GONG
H$\alpha$, Hida spectrum and SDO/AIA 304 A, the formation process of the
filament is studied. It is found that cool material ($T\sim10^4$ K) is ejected
by a series of jets originating from the western foot-point of the filament.
Simultaneously, the magnetic flux emerged from the photosphere in the vicinity
of the western foot-point of the filament. These observations suggest that cool
material in the low atmosphere can be directly injected into the upper
atmosphere and the jets are triggered by the magnetic reconnection between
pre-existing magnetic fields and new emerging magnetic fields. Detailed study
of a jet at 18:02 UT on August 11 with GST/BBSO TiO observations reveals that
some dark threads appeared in the vicinity of the western foot-point after the
jet and the projection velocity of plasma along the filament axis was about
162.6$\pm$5.4 km/s. Using with DST/Hida observations, we find that the injected
plasma by a jet at 00:42 UT on August 12 was rotating. Therefore, we conclude
that the jets not only supplied the material for the filament, but also
injected the helicity into the filament simultaneously. Comparing the quantity
of mass injection by the jets with the mass of the filament, we conclude that
the estimated mass loading by the jets is sufficient to account for the mass in
the filament.

  models with dynamic noise-contrastive estimation","6 pages. Has been submitted to SLT 2018",,,,"cs.CL stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new whole-sentence language model - neural trans-dimensional random field
language model (neural TRF LM), where sentences are modeled as a collection of
random fields, and the potential function is defined by a neural network, has
been introduced and successfully trained by noise-contrastive estimation (NCE).
In this paper, we extend NCE and propose dynamic noise-contrastive estimation
(DNCE) to solve the two problems observed in NCE training. First, a dynamic
noise distribution is introduced and trained simultaneously to converge to the
data distribution. This helps to significantly cut down the noise sample number
used in NCE and reduce the training cost. Second, DNCE discriminates between
sentences generated from the noise distribution and sentences generated from
the interpolation of the data distribution and the noise distribution. This
alleviates the overfitting problem caused by the sparseness of the training
set. With DNCE, we can successfully and efficiently train neural TRF LMs on
large corpus (about 0.8 billion words) with large vocabulary (about 568 K
words). Neural TRF LMs perform as good as LSTM LMs with less parameters and
being 5x~114x faster in rescoring sentences. Interpolating neural TRF LMs with
LSTM LMs and n-gram LMs can further reduce the error rates.

Thus, a vast variety of approaches proposed in the literature demonstrated
considerable performance gains using hardware platforms such as many-core CPUs

largely manual process, we sketch directions for future research towards
automating the hardware mapping and execution. This survey targets modellers

unexploitable. However, some remnants of the vulnerabilities are still
exploitable even under the randomized layout. According to our analysis, such
heap exploits often abuse pointer-width allocation granularity to spray crafted
pointers. To address this problem, we explore the efficacy of byte-granularity
(the most fine-grained) heap randomization. Heap randomization, in general, has
been a well-trodden area; however, the efficacy of byte-granularity
randomization has never been fully explored as \emph{misalignment} raises
various concerns. This paper unravels the pros and cons of byte-granularity
heap randomization by conducting comprehensive analysis in three folds: (i)
security effectiveness, (ii) performance impact, and (iii) compatibility
analysis to measure deployment cost. Security discussion based on 20 CVE case
studies suggests that byte-granularity heap randomization raises the bar
against heap exploits more than we initially expected; as pointer spraying
approach is becoming prevalent in modern heap exploits. Afterward, to demystify
the skeptical concerns regarding misalignment, we conduct cycle-level
microbenchmarks and report that the performance cost is highly concentrated to
edge cases depending on L1-cache line. Based on such observations, we design
and implement an allocator suited to optimize the performance cost of
byte-granularity heap randomization; then evaluate the performance with the
memory-intensive benchmark (SPEC2006). Finally, we discuss compatibility issues
using Coreutils, Nginx, and ChakraCore.

employed both the original relativistic impulse approximation (IA1) and the
generalised impulse approximation (IA2) formalisms to calculate the
relativistic optical potentials, with target densities derived from
relativistic mean field (RMF) theory using the NL3 and FSUGold parameter sets.
Comparisons between the optical potentials computed using both IA1 and IA2
formalisms, and the different RMF Lagrangians are presented for both stable and
unstable targets. The comparisons are required to study the effect of using IA1
versus IA2 optical potentials, with different RMF parameter sets, on elastic
scattering observables for unstable targets at intermediate energies. We also
study the effect of full-folding versus the factorized form of the optical
potentials on elastic scattering observables. As with the case for stable
nuclei, we found that the use of the full-folding optical potential improves
the scattering observables (especially spin observables) at low intermediate
energy (e.g. 200MeV). No discernible difference is found at a projectile
incident energy of 500 MeV. To check the validity of using localized optical
potential, we calculate the scattering observables using non-local potentials
by solving the momentum space Dirac equation. The Dirac equation is transformed
to two coupled Lippmann-Schwinger equations, which are then numerically solved

Polarization singularities are locations at which an aspect of the polarization

describes a perfect circle in time. In 2D slices of 3D random fields the
distribution in space of the C points is reminiscent of that of interacting

most notable change is that the probability of finding two C points with the
same topological charge at a vanishing distance is enhanced in a 2D field. This
is an unusual finding for any system which exhibits topological singularities
as same-charge repulsion is typically observed. All our experimental findings

planetary nebulae and bring useful information on nebular geometries. A model
of homogeneous sphere or shell cannot fit the nebular spectra and brightness
temperatures. Two alternative models have been proposed in the literature: the
first one consists of two homogeneous components, while the other one is a
model of a shell with a significant radial density gradient. On the other side,
prolate ellipsoidal shell model can successfully fit the surface brightness
distribution of selected objects. We verify the existing models using data
collected in radio surveys covering wide range of frequencies. In about 50%
cases, density gradient can be excluded, and none of the remaining objects
could be confirmed. None of the observed planetary nebulae show the spectral
index of 0.6 in the optically thick part of the spectrum, which is a value
predicted for a shell containing strong radial density gradient. Radio spectra
can be fitted with a model of prolate ellipsoidal shell, but also by a shell
containing temperature variations in planetary nebulae. At least eight
planetary nebulae show two component spectra, with one compact component
showing much higher optical thickness than the other one. Unexpectedly, a group
of planetary nebulae with lowest surface brightness show non-negligible optical
thickness. Their emission comes from compact and dense structures, comprising
only small part of total nebular mass.

Galactic inheritance broadly explains most of them, especially if $r$-process
nuclei are produced by neutron star merging according to recent models.
Instead, $^{26}$Al, $^{41}$Ca, $^{135}$Cs and possibly $^{60}$Fe require
nucleosynthesis events close to the solar formation. We outline the persisting
difficulties to account for these nuclei by Intermediate Mass Stars (2
$\lesssim $ M/M$_\odot \lesssim 7 - 8$). Models of their final stages now
predict the ubiquitous formation of a $^{13}$C reservoir as a neutron capture
source; hence, even in presence of $^{26}$Al production from Deep Mixing or Hot
Bottom Burning, the ratio $^{26}$Al/$^{107}$Pd remains incompatible with
measured data, with a large excess in $^{107}$Pd. This is shown for two recent
approaches to Deep Mixing. Even a late contamination by a Massive Star meets
problems. In fact, inhomogeneous addition of Supernova debris predicts
non-measured excesses on stable isotopes. Revisions invoking specific low-mass
supernovae and/or the sequential contamination of the pre-solar molecular cloud
might be affected by similar problems, although our conclusions here are
weakened by our schematic approach to the addition of SN ejecta. The limited
parameter space remaining to be explored for solving this puzzle is discussed.

a consequence of that, a series of non-ideal effects (ambipolar diffusion, Hall

Singleton-type bound dictates the best possible trade-off between the dimension
and distance of LRCs --- an LRC attaining this trade-off is deemed
\emph{optimal}. Such optimal LRCs have been constructed over alphabets growing
linearly in the block length. Unlike the classical Singleton bound, however, it
was not known if such a linear growth in the alphabet size is necessary, or for
that matter even if the alphabet needs to grow at all with the block length.
Indeed, for small code distances $3,4$, arbitrarily long optimal LRCs were
known over fixed alphabets.
  Here, we prove that for distances $d \ge 5$, the code length $n$ of an
optimal LRC over an alphabet of size $q$ must be at most roughly $O(d q^3)$.
For the case $d=5$, our upper bound is $O(q^2)$. We complement these bounds by
showing the existence of optimal LRCs of length
$\Omega_{d,r}(q^{1+1/\lfloor(d-3)/2\rfloor})$ when $d \le r+2$. These bounds
match when $d=5$, thus pinning down $n=\Theta(q^2)$ as the asymptotically

learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse
approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but
perform exact inference, posterior approximations which retain exact prior but
perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations which
exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we
highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from

clique $K_{l}$ in the classical distributed CONGEST model, where the
communication topology is the same as the topology of the underlying network,
and with limited communication bandwidth on the links.
  Our first and main result is a lower bound, showing that detecting $K_{l}$
requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n} / b)$ communication rounds, for every $4 \le l \le
\sqrt{n}$, and $\Omega(n / (l b))$ rounds for every $l \ge \sqrt{n}$, where $b$

reduction to the set disjointness problem in the framework of two-party
communication complexity.

listing all cliques in the input graph, which up to constant factors
communicates the same number of bits as our lower bound for $K_4$ detection.
This demonstrates that our lower bound cannot be improved using the two-party

$E_\ell$ in $W_0^{2,2}(\Omega)$. For $0\leq\alpha<\lambda_{\ell+1}(\Omega)$, we
define a norm by $\|u\|_{2,\alpha}^{2}=\|\Delta u\|^2_2-\alpha \|u\|^2_2$ for
$u\in E^\bot_{\ell}$. In this paper, using the blow-up analysis, we prove the
following Adams inequalities $$\sup_{u\in E_{\ell}^{\bot},\,\|

above supremum can be attained by a function $u_0\in E_{\ell}^{\bot}\cap

its gravitational generalization, with an emphasis on the case of maximal
supergravity. It is divided into three parts. In the first part, we review the
the Cremmer-Julia ""hidden"" symmetries of maximal supergravity in various
dimensions. Two new results are obtained: we prove that those symmetries appear
if and only if the Chern-Simons coupling of the $D=11$ theory takes the value
predicted by supersymmetry, and we obtain a manifestly $E_{7(7)}$-invariant
formula for the entropy of non-extremal black holes in $D=4$, $N=8$
supergravity. The second part is motivated by supergravity gaugings. We examine
through BRST methods the local deformations of non-minimally coupled scalars
and abelian vector fields in four dimensions. We prove that they are all of the
usual Yang-Mills type, i.e., correspond to the gauging of some rigid symmetries
of the undeformed theory. We also show that other Lagragians considered in the
literature, containing additional fields, do not allow for gaugings that cannot
be reached starting from the usual Lagrangian. In the third part, we construct
self-contained action principles for several self-dual free fields in six
dimensions. These fields are motivated by two considerations: they allow for a
geometric interpretation of the electric-magnetic duality symmetries of
linearized gravity in four dimensions, and they also appear in the spectrum of
the chiral $N=(4,0)$ and $N=(3,1)$ ""exotic supergravities"" in place of a
metric. The free action and supersymmetry transformations for those theories
are then explicitly constructed. We check that they reduce to linearized
maximal supergravity in five dimensions, and also generalize previous works on
linearized supergravity by other authors in which the graviton and its dual
appear on the same footing at the level of the action.

resolution is required to capture the finer details of the likely magnetic
reconnection-driven, rapidly evolving bursts. Such observations are also needed
to reveal their similarities to large-scale flares, which are also thought to
be reconnection driven, and more generally their role in chromospheric heating.
Here we report observations of chromospheric heating in the form of a UV burst
obtained with the balloon-borne observatory, SUNRISE. The observed burst
displayed a spatial morphology similar to that of a large-scale solar flare
with circular ribbon. While the co-temporal UV observations at 1.5'' spatial
resolution and 24s cadence from the Solar Dynamics Observatory showed a compact
brightening, the SUNRISE observations at diffraction-limited spatial resolution
of 0.1'' at 7s cadence revealed a dynamic sub-structure of the burst that it is
composed of extended ribbon-like features and a rapidly evolving arcade of thin
(~0.1'' wide) magnetic loop-like features, similar to post-flare loops. Such a
dynamic sub-structure reveals the small-scale nature of chromospheric heating
in these bursts. Furthermore, based on magnetic field extrapolations, this
heating event is associated with a complex fan-spine magnetic topology. Our
observations strongly hint at a unified picture of magnetic heating in the
solar atmosphere from some large-scale flares to small-scale bursts, all being
associated with such a magnetic topology.

performances, involving a variety of underlying factors. Previous work has
showed a relation between such expressive variations (in particular expressive
tempo) and perceptual characteristics derived from the musical score, such as
musical expectations, and perceived tension. In this work we use a
computational approach to study the role of three measures of tonal tension
proposed by Herremans and Chew (2016) in the prediction of expressive
performances of classical piano music. These features capture tonal
relationships of the music represented in Chew's spiral array model, a three
dimensional representation of pitch classes, chords and keys constructed in
such a way that spatial proximity represents close tonal relationships. We use
non-linear sequential models (recurrent neural networks) to assess the
contribution of these features to the prediction of expressive dynamics and
expressive tempo using a dataset of Mozart piano sonatas performed by a
professional concert pianist. Experiments of models trained with and without
tonal tension features show that tonal tension helps predict change of tempo
and dynamics more than absolute tempo and dynamics values. Furthermore, the
improvement is stronger for dynamics than for tempo.

research. Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) achieve this by attaching weights to
formulas in first-order logic, and can be seen as templates for constructing
features for ground Markov networks. Most techniques for learning weights of
MLNs are domain-size agnostic, i.e., the size of the domain is not explicitly
taken into account while learn- ing the parameters of the model. This often
results in ex- treme probabilities when testing on domain sizes different from
those seen during training. In this paper, we propose Domain Aware Markov logic
Networks (DA-MLNs) which present a principled solution to this problem. While
defin- ing the ground network distribution, DA-MLNs divide the ground feature
weight by a scaling factor which is a function of the number of connections the
ground atoms appearing in the feature are involved in. We show that standard
MLNs fall out as a special case of our formalism when this func- tion evaluates
to a constant equal to 1. Experiments on the benchmark Friends & Smokers domain
show that our ap- proach results in significantly higher accuracies compared to
existing methods when testing on domains whose sizes different from those seen

avenues to analyze deep learning. In particular, it is observed that new
insights can be obtained by recasting deep learning as an optimal control
problem on difference or differential equations. However, the mathematical
aspects of such a formulation have not been systematically explored. This paper
introduces the mathematical formulation of the population risk minimization
problem in deep learning as a mean-field optimal control problem. Mirroring the
development of classical optimal control, we state and prove optimality
conditions of both the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type and the Pontryagin type.
These mean-field results reflect the probabilistic nature of the learning
problem. In addition, by appealing to the mean-field Pontryagin's maximum
principle, we establish some quantitative relationships between population and
empirical learning problems. This serves to establish a mathematical foundation
for investigating the algorithmic and theoretical connections between optimal
control and deep learning.

particular, it is shown that the dominant complexity of the proposed method is
the complexity of computing the kernel matrix. Additional appealing
characteristics of the proposed one-class classifier are: 1-the ability to be
trained in an incremental fashion (allowing for application in streaming data
scenarios while also reducing the computational complexity in a non-streaming
operation mode); 2-being unsupervised, but providing the option for refining
the solution using negative training examples, when available; And last but not

resources at the edge of network, thereby reducing the latency and improving
the quality of service. However, it is still desirable to investigate how and
where at the edge of the network the computation capacity should be
provisioned. To this end, we propose a hierarchical capacity provisioning
scheme. In particular, we consider a two-tier network architecture consisting
of shallow and deep cloudlets and explore the benefits of hierarchical capacity
based on queueing analysis. Moreover, we explore two different network
scenarios in which the network delay between the two tiers is negligible as
well as the case that the deep cloudlet is located somewhere deeper in the
network and thus the delay is significant. More importantly, we model the first
network delay scenario with bufferless shallow cloudlets as well as the second
scenario with finite-size buffer shallow cloudlets, and formulate an
optimization problem for each model. We also use stochastic ordering to solve
the optimization problem formulated for the first model and an upper bound
based technique is proposed for the second model. The performance of the
proposed scheme is evaluated via simulations in which we show the accuracy of
the proposed upper bound technique as well as the queue length estimation
approach for both randomly generated input and real trace data.

geophysical exploration of wells. However, during the conduct of such a study,
the sensor, for one reason or another, may stop recording observations in the
well. If a small number of values are missing, you can restore these values
using standard methods to fill in gaps like in time series. If data miss a
large number of values, observations usually are made again, which leads to
additional financial costs. This work proposes an alternative solution, in the
form of filling missed observations in data with the help of machine learning
methods. The main idea of this method is to construct a simple two- layer
neural network that is trained on data from the well, and then synthesise the
missing values based on the trained neural network. This work evaluates the
effectiveness of the proposed method, and gives reasons for the appropriateness
of using different methods of filling gaps, depending on the number of missed
values.

then measured the usability and security. Results: The participants who used

domains because of their great power to extract good features automatically.
However, many deep CNNs-based computer vison tasks suffer from lack of training
data while there are millions of parameters in the deep models. Obviously,
these two biphase violation facts will result in parameter redundancy of many
poorly designed deep CNNs. Therefore, we look deep into the existing CNNs and
find that the redundancy of network parameters comes from the correlation
between features in different channels within a convolutional layer. To solve
this problem, we propose the stochastic channel decorrelation (SCD) block
which, in every iteration, randomly selects multiple pairs of channels within a
convolutional layer and calculates their normalized cross correlation (NCC).
Then a squared max-margin loss is proposed as the objective of SCD to suppress
correlation and keep diversity between channels explicitly. The proposed SCD is
very flexible and can be applied to any current existing CNN models simply.
Based on the SCD and the Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks, we proposed a
visual tracking algorithm to verify the effectiveness of SCD.

  We show that if $G$ is not a bicentred tree, then for every vertex colouring
of $G$ there is a less symmetric edge colouring with the same number of
colours. On the other hand, if $T$ is a tree, then for every edge colouring
there is a less symmetric vertex colouring with the same number of edges.
  Our results can be used to characterise those graphs whose distinguishing
index is larger than their distinguishing number.

field which has several applications in computer graphics. Recent studies have
demonstrated the advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs) for achieving
remarkable performance in motion and music tasks with little effort for feature
pre-processing. However, applying DNNs for generating dance to a piece of music
is nevertheless challenging, because of 1) DNNs need to generate large
sequences while mapping the music input, 2) the DNN needs to constraint the
motion beat to the music, and 3) DNNs require a considerable amount of
hand-crafted data. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep recurrent
method for real-time basic dance generation with audio power spectrum as input.
The proposed model employs convolutional layers and a multilayered Long
Short-Term memory (LSTM) to process the audio input. Then, another deep LSTM
layer decodes the target dance sequence. Notably, this end-to-end approach has
1) an auto-conditioned decode configuration that reduces accumulation of
feedback error of large dance sequence, 2) uses a contrastive cost function to
regulate the mapping between the music and motion beat, and 3) trains with weak
labels generated from the motion beat, reducing the amount of hand-crafted
data. We evaluate the proposed network based on i) the similarities between
generated and the baseline dancer motion with a cross entropy measure for large
dance sequences, and ii) accurate timing between the music and motion beat with
an F-measure. Experimental results revealed that, after training using a small
dataset, the model generates basic dance steps with low cross entropy and
maintains an F-measure score similar to that of a baseline dancer.

tasks in industrial scenes such as detecting micro scratches on product. In
recent years, due to the difficulty of defining anomalies and the limit of
correcting their labels, research on unsupervised anomaly detection using
generative models has attracted attention. Generally, in those studies, only
normal images are used for training to model the distribution of normal images.
The model measures the anomalies in the target images by reproducing the most
similar images and scoring image patches indicating their fit to the learned
distribution. This approach is based on a strong presumption; the trained model
should not be able to generate abnormal images. However, in reality, the model
can generate abnormal images mainly due to noisy normal data which include
small abnormal pixels, and such noise severely affects the accuracy of the

to the larger class of accelerated tests used extensively in the reliability

popular cumulative exposure model. However, despite its simple form, the
utility of the model is limited, as it is assumed that the hazard function of
the underlying distribution is discontinuous at the points at which the stress
levels are changed, which may not be very reasonable. Due to this deficiency,
Kannan et al. \cite{KKNT:2010} introduced the cumulative risk model, where the
hazard function is continuous. In this paper we propose a class of parametric

  Tailed Errors",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the estimation of the unknown parameters of the
multiple chirp signal model in presence of additive error. The chirp signals
are quite common in many areas of science and engineering, specially sonar,
radar, audio signals etc. The observed signals are usually corrupted by noise.
In different signal processing applications it is observed that the errors may
be heavy tailed. In this paper it is assumed that the additive errors have mean
zero but may not have finite variance and are independent and identically
distributed. We consider the least squares estimators and the approximate least
squares estimators which maximize a periodogram like function. It has been
observed that both the estimators are strongly consistent. The asymptotic
distribution of the least squares estimators is obtained under the assumption
that the additive errors are from a symmetric stable distribution. The
approximate least squares estimators have the same asymptotic distribution as
the least squares estimators. We perform some numerical simulations to see how
the proposed estimators work. It is observed that the least squares estimators
perform slightly better than the approximately least squares estimators in
terms of the biases and mean absolute deviation.

developed in the same extent as traditional frequentist approaches. In this
work, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach for quantitative learning for such
models. These models belong to curved exponential families that are difficult
to handle from a Bayesian perspective. Furthermore, the likelihood cannot be
analytically expressed as a function of the marginal log-linear interactions,
but only in terms of cell counts or probabilities.
  Posterior distributions cannot be directly obtained, and MCMC methods are
needed. Finally, a well-defined model requires parameter values that lead to
compatible marginal probabilities. Hence, any MCMC should account for this
important restriction. We construct a fully automatic and efficient MCMC
strategy for quantitative learning for graphical log-linear marginal models
that handles these problems. While the prior is expressed in terms of the
marginal log-linear interactions, we build an MCMC algorithm that employs a
proposal on the probability parameter space. The corresponding proposal on the
marginal log-linear interactions is obtained via parameter transformation.
  By this strategy, we achieve to move within the desired target space. At each
step, we directly work with well-defined probability distributions.
  Moreover, we can exploit a conditional conjugate setup to build an efficient
proposal on probability parameters. The proposed methodology is illustrated by
a simulation study and a real dataset.

maximum edge-weight $k$-plex partitioning problem (Max-EkPP) is to find the
$k$-plex partitioning in edge-weighted network, such that the sum of edge
weights is maximal. The Max-EkPP has an important role in discovering new
information in large sparse biological networks. We propose a variable
neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm for solving Max-EkPP. The VNS implements a
local search based on the 1-swap first improvement strategy and the objective
function that takes into account the degree of every vertex in each partition.
The objective function favors feasible solutions, also enabling a gradual
increase in terms of objective function value when moving from slightly
infeasible to barely feasible solutions. A comprehensive experimental
computation is performed on real metabolic networks and other benchmark
instances from literature. Comparing to the integer linear programming method
from literature, our approach succeeds to find all known optimal solutions. For
all other instances, the VNS either reaches previous best known solution or
improves it. The proposed VNS is also tested on a large-scaled dataset which
was not previously considered in literature.

class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, providing mechanisms for exact

sub-optimal amount of information from the remaining code blocks. The key
advantage of these codes is a significantly lower sub-packetization that grows
only logarithmically with the length of the code, while providing optimality in
storage and error-correcting capacity. However, from an implementation point of
view, these codes require each remaining code block to be available for the
repair of any single code block. In this paper, we address this issue by
constructing $\epsilon$-MSR codes that can repair a failed code block by
contacting a fewer number of available code blocks. When a code block fails,
our repair procedure needs to contact a few compulsory code blocks and is free
to choose any subset of available code blocks for the remaining choices.
Further, our construction requiresa field size linear in code length and
ensures load balancing among the contacted code blocks in terms of information

for matrix multiplication, namely private polynomial codes, based on polynomial
codes for conventional coded computation. As special cases of private

of an iterative solution procedure for the full nonlinear problem. A

  Recently, there has been a surge of online social websites where fashion

the style information learned by the model. We use the encoder decoder
architecture to solve this problem of completing the set of fashion items. We
evaluate the goodness of the proposed model through a variety of experiments.
We empirically observe that our proposed model outperforms competitive baseline

complete the fashion ensemble. We also perform retrieval based experiments to
understand the ability of the model to learn style and rank the complementary

spectral point sources of the signal from time samples. In many associated
applications such as radar and sonar, due to cut-off and saturation regions in
electronic devices, some of the numbers of samples are corrupted by spiky
noise. To overcome this problem, we present a new convex program to
simultaneously estimate spectral point sources and spiky noise in two
dimensions. To prove uniqueness of the solution, it is sufficient to show that
a dual certificate exists. Construction of the dual certificate imposes a mild
condition on the separation of the spectral point sources. Also, the number of
spikes and detectable sparse sources are shown to be a logarithmic function of
the number of time samples. Simulation results confirm the conclusions of our
general theory.

multiplexes revealed significant correlations across the hyperbolic node
coordinates in different network layers, which facilitated applications like
trans-layer link prediction and mutual navigation. But are geometric
correlations alone sufficient to explain the topological relation between the
layers of real systems? Here we provide the negative answer to this question.
We show that connections in real systems tend to persist from one layer to
another irrespectively of their hyperbolic distances. This suggests that in
addition to purely geometric aspects the explicit link formation process in one
layer impacts the topology of other layers. Based on this finding, we present a
simple modification to the recently developed Geometric Multiplex Model to
account for this effect, and show that the extended model can reproduce the
behavior observed in real systems. We also find that link persistence is
significant in all considered multiplexes and can explain their layers' high
edge overlap, which cannot be explained by coordinate correlations alone.
Furthermore, by taking both link persistence and hyperbolic distance
correlations into account we can improve trans-layer link prediction. These
findings guide the development of multiplex embedding methods, suggesting that
such methods should be accounting for both coordinate correlations and link
persistence across layers.

of epidemics. Recent studies focus on the effects of mobility to epidemic
process. However, uncorrelated random walk is typically assumed as the type of
movement. In our daily life, the movement of people sometimes tends to be
limited to a certain direction, which can be described by biased random walk.
Here, we developed an agent-based model of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
epidemic process in a 2D continuous space where agents tend to move in a
certain direction in addition to random movement. Moreover, we mainly focus on
the effect of the reduced mobility of infected agents. Our model assumes that,
when people are infected, their movement activity is greatly reduced because
they are physically weakened by the disease. By conducting extensive
simulations, we found that when the movement of infected people is limited, the
final epidemic size becomes small. However, that crucially depended on the
movement type of agents. Furthermore, the reduced mobility of infected agents
lengthened the duration of the epidemic because the infection progressed
slowly.

resonance due to space charge effects [Chao Li and R. A. Jameson, Phys. Rev.
Accel. Beams 21, 024204, 2018], this paper aims to demonstrate how the beam, as
a whole, is spontaneously affected when the predicted mixed coherent 2nd/4th
order structure resonance stop band around $90^{\circ}$ phase advance is
crossed. The beam characteristics during the structure resonance crossing, such
as the rms emittance growth and the appearance of 2-fold/4-fold structure in
phase space, are well explained by the mixture characteristic of different
orders of structure resonance. The related `attracting' and `repulsive' effects
in the structure resonance stop band from below and above crossing are
considered as a natural beam reaction to the coherent structure resonance that
the beam spontaneously moves to a structure resonance free region then the
space charge takes a weaker importance. In the PIC simulation, it is found that
the emittance growth is positively related to the time that the beam spends
inside the structure resonance stop band. As a potential candidate mechanism,
the incoherent particle-core resonance also has been checked. It is found that
this incoherent resonance has basic difficulties in explaining the results
obtained from the self-consistent PIC simulation. The incoherent particle-core
resonance might lead to phase space distortion, emittance growth, or beam halo
formation only on a long-time scale. This clarity of the discrepancies between
coherent and incoherent resonance mechanisms will lead to a better
understanding of the numerical study and experimental researches obtained
recently. In addition, similar understanding can be extended to the study of
higher order structure resonance.

controlled by the propulsion mechanism in combination with various direct
interactions, such as steric repulsion, hydrodynamics, and chemical fields.
Yet, these direct interactions are typically anisotropic, and come in different
'flavors', such as spherical and elongated particle shapes for steric
repulsion, pusher and puller flow fields for hydrodynamics, etc. The
combination of the various aspects is expected to lead to new emergent
behavior. However, it is a priori not evident whether shape and hydrodynamics
act synergistically or antagonistically to generate motility-induced clustering
(MIC) and phase separation (MIPS). We employ a model of prolate spheroidal
microswimmers - called squirmers - in quasi-two-dimensional confinement to
address this issue by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. For comparison,
non-hydrodynamic active Brownian particles (ABPs) are considered to elucidate
the contribution of hydrodynamic interactions on MIC and MIPS. For spherical
particles, the comparison between ABP and hydrodynamic-squirmer ensembles
reveals a suppression of MIPS due to hydrodynamic interactions. The fundamental
difference between ABPs and squirmers is attributed to an increased
reorientation of squirmers by hydrodynamic torques during their collisions. In
contrast, for elongated squirmers, hydrodynamics interactions enhance MIPS.
Thus, hydrodynamic interactions show opposing effects on MIPS for spherical and
elongated microswimmers.

security by adding adversarial noise only within a specific region without

results demonstrate that in the short wavelength range, the power spectra
reflect fluctuation statistics of the perpendicular component of turbulent

the Faraday rotation density, which is a product of the parallel component of
magnetic field and thermal electron density. We find that our numerical results
(in the case of spatially coincident regions) are in agreement with the

study electrical forces and sample properties, with the most widely used
experiment being frequency-modulated Kelvin probe force microscopy. The
equations commonly used to interpret this experiment, however, rely on two
hidden assumptions: (1) the tip charge oscillates in phase with the cantilever
motion to keep the tip voltage constant, and (2) any changes in the tip-sample
interaction happen slowly. Starting from an electro-mechanical model of the
cantilever-sample interaction, we use Lagrangian mechanics to derive coupled
equations of motion for the cantilever position and charge. This general
approach rigorously describes scanned probe experiments even in the case when
the usual assumptions of fast tip charging and slowly changing samples
properties are violated. We develop a Magnus-expansion approximation to
illustrate how abrupt changes in the tip-sample interaction cause abrupt
changes in the cantilever amplitude and phase. We show that feedback-free
time-resolved electric force microscopy cannot uniquely determine sub-cycle
photocapacitance dynamics. We then use first-order perturbation theory to
relate cantilever frequency shift and dissipation to the sample impedance even
when the tip charge oscillates out of phase with the cantilever motion.
Analogous to the treatment of impedance spectroscopy in electrochemistry, we
apply this approximation to determine the cantilever frequency shift and
dissipation for an arbitrary sample impedance in (broadband) local dielectric
spectroscopy experiments. The general approaches we develop provide a path
forward for rigorously modeling the coupled motion of the cantilever position

feedback law abides the following rules: First, we divide equally the time
interval $[0,+\infty)$ into infinitely many disjoint time periods, and divide
each time period into three disjoint subintervals. Second, for each time
period, we observe a solution over an open subset of $\Omega$ in the first
subinterval, take sample from outputs at one time point of the first
subinterval, add a time-invariant output feedback control over another open
subset of $\Omega$ in the second subinterval; let the equation evolve free in
the last subinterval. Thus, the corresponding feedback control is of
sampled-data. Our feedback law has the following advantages: the sampling
period (which is the length of the above time period) can be arbitrarily taken;
the feedback law has an explicit expression in terms of the sampling period;
the behaviors of the norm of the feedback law, when the sampling period goes to

two kinds of approximate null-controllability for heat equations. One has
time-invariant controls, while another has impulse controls. The studies of the
aforementioned controllability with time-invariant controls need a new

specimens that are only accessible from a single side, such as well systems and

reconstruction approaches using a linear forward model have been shown to
significantly improve image quality compared to the conventional approach.
However, even these techniques result in artifacts for complex objects because

  In this paper, we propose a non-iterative model-based reconstruction method
for inverting measurements that are based on non-linear forward models for

the reconstruction using a simple linear back-projection and training a deep

intended goals, namely, communication uncertainties and faults, relative to the
increased integration of networked and wireless devices, hinder the synchronism
needed to meet real-time deadlines. Moreover, being critical, these systems are
also exposed to significant security threats. This threat combination increases
the risk of physical damage. This paper addresses these problems by studying
how to build the first real-time Byzantine reliable broadcast protocol (RTBRB)
tolerating network uncertainties, faults, and attacks. Previous literature
describes either real-time reliable broadcast protocols, or asynchronous (non
real-time) Byzantine~ones.
  We first prove that it is impossible to implement RTBRB using traditional
distributed computing paradigms, e.g., where the error/failure detection
mechanisms of processes are decoupled from the broadcast algorithm itself, even
with the help of the most powerful failure detectors. We circumvent this
impossibility by proposing RT-ByzCast, an algorithm based on aggregating
digital signatures in a sliding time-window and on empowering processes with
self-crashing capabilities to mask and bound losses. We show that RT-ByzCast
(i) operates in real-time by proving that messages broadcast by correct
processes are delivered within a known bounded delay, and (ii) is reliable by
demonstrating that correct processes using our algorithm crash themselves with
a negligible probability, even with message loss rates as high as 60%.

generating discrete data (e.g., text data), while classical GANs are clumsy for
this task due to the vanishing gradient problem. (ii) Our scheme avoids the
input/output bottlenecks embarrassing most of the existing quantum learning
algorithms that either require to encode the classical input data into quantum
states, or output a quantum state corresponding to the solution instead of
giving the solution itself, which inevitably compromises the speedup of the
quantum algorithm. (iii) The probability distribution implicitly given by data
samples can be loaded into a quantum state, which may be useful for some
further applications.

the notion of leak competitiveness, which compares the leakage of two cache

  First, we show that leak competitiveness is symmetric in the cache
algorithms. This implies that no cache algorithm dominates another in terms of
leakage via a program's total execution time. This is in contrast to
performance, where it is known that such dominance relationships exist.

temporal correlation and fluctuation effects resulting from the fundamentally
stochastic kinetics underlying chemical reactions and the dynamics of
populations or epidemics. After reviewing the assumptions and mean-field type
approximations involved in the construction of chemical rate equations for
uniform reactant densities, we first discuss spatial clustering in birth-death
systems, where non-linearities are introduced through either density-limiting
pair reactions, or equivalently via local imposition of finite carrying
capacities. The competition of offspring production, death, and non-linear
inhibition induces a population extinction threshold, which represents a
non-equilibrium phase transition that separates active from absorbing states.
This continuous transition is characterized by the universal scaling exponents
of critical directed percolation clusters. Next we focus on the emergence of
depletion zones in single-species annihilation processes and spatial population
segregation with the associated reaction fronts in two-species pair
annihilation. These strong (anti-)correlation effects are dynamically generated
by the underlying stochastic kinetics. Finally, we address noise-induced and
fluctuation-stabilized spatio-temporal patterns in basic predator-prey systems,
exemplified by spreading activity fronts in the two-species Lotka-Volterra
model as well as spiral structures in the May-Leonard variant of cyclically
competing three-species systems akin to rock-paper-scissors games.

prepared and characterized in UHV, is transferred into a separate, small
chamber. This chamber already contains a volume of ultrapure water ice, whose
vapor pressure is reduced to UHV range by cooling it to cryogenic temperatures.
Upon warming, the ice melts and forms a liquid droplet, which is deposited on
the sample. First experiments carried out on rutile TiO2(110) single crystals

of an individual is determined jointly by the magnitude of their opinion, their
degree of conformity with their social neighbors, and the benefit of having
social connections. Each individual can simultaneously adjust their opinion as
well as the weights of their social connections. We present and validate the

transition from cohesive communities with consensus to divisive networks with
splitting opinions. Moreover, we apply our model to voting records of the

The flare exhibits a strong late-phase peak of the warm coronal emissions
($\sim$3~MK) of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), with peak emission over 1.3 times
that of the main flare peak. Multiple flare ribbons are observed, whose
evolution indicates a two-stage energy release process. A non-linear force-free
field (NLFFF) extrapolation reveals the existence of a magnetic null point, a
fan-spine structure, and two flux ropes embedded in the fan dome. Magnetic
reconnections involved in the flare are driven by the destabilization and rise
of one of the flux ropes. In the first stage, the fast ascending flux rope
drives reconnections at the null point and the surrounding quasi-separatrix
layer (QSL), while in the second stage, reconnection mainly occurs between the
two legs of the field lines stretched by the eventually stopped flux rope. The
late-phase loops are mainly produced by the first-stage QSL reconnection, while
the second-stage reconnection is responsible for the heating of main flaring
loops. The first-stage reconnection is believed to be more powerful, leading to
an extremely strong EUV late phase. We find that the delayed occurrence of the
late-phase peak is mainly due to the long cooling process of the long
late-phase loops. Using the model enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops
(EBTEL), we model the EUV emissions from a late-phase loop. The modeling
reveals a peak heating rate of 1.1~erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ for the late-phase
loop, which is obviously higher than previous values.

relational properties among quantum systems, instead of the independent

formulation. The implementation not only clarifies the physical meaning of the
relational probability amplitude, but also allows us to elegantly explain the
double slit experiment, to describe the interaction history between the
measured system and a series of measuring systems, and to calculate
entanglement entropy based on path integral and influence functional. In
return, the implementation brings back new insight to path integral itself by
completing the explanation on why measurement probability can be calculated as
modulus square of probability amplitude. Lastly, we clarify the connection
between our reformulation and the quantum reference frame theory. A complete

model that grows by node duplication (ND). Such models are useful in the study
of the structure and growth dynamics of gene regulatory networks and scientific
citation networks. Starting from an initial seed network, at each time step a
random node, a mother node, is selected for duplication. Its daughter node is
added to the network and duplicates each outgoing link of the mother node with
probability p. In addition, the daughter node forms a directed link to the
mother node itself. We obtain analytical results for the in-degree distribution
$P_t(K_{in}=k)$, and for the out-degree distribution $P_t(K_{out}=k)$ at time
t. The in-degrees follow a shifted power-law, so the network is asymptotically
scale free. In contrast, the out-degree distribution is narrow, and converges
to a Poisson distribution in the sparse network limit and to a Gaussian
distribution in the dense network limit. Such distinction between a broad
in-degree distribution and a narrow out-degree distribution is common in
empirical networks such as scientific citation networks. Using this we
calculate the mean degree $\langle K_{in}\rangle_t=\langle K_{out}\rangle_t$,
which converges to $1/(1-p)$ in the large network limit, for the whole range of
$0<p<1$. This is in contrast to the corresponding undirected network, which
exhibits a phase transition at $p=1/2$ such that for $p>1/2$ the mean degree
diverges in the large network limit. We also present analytical results for the
distribution of the number of upstream and downstream nodes from a random node.
The mean values $\langle N_{up}\rangle_t=\langle N_{down}\rangle_t$ scale
logarithmically with the network size, implying that only a small fraction of
pairs of nodes are connected by directed paths, unlike the undirected ND case
that consists of a single component, hence not a small-world network.

in cubic Lovelock gravity. The spatial section is a product of three- and
extra-dimensional isotropic subspaces. This is the second paper of the series
and we consider D=5 and general D>=6 cases here. For each D case we found
critical values for $\alpha$ (Gauss-Bonnet coupling) and $\beta$ (cubic
Lovelock coupling) which separate different dynamical cases and study the
dynamics in each region to find all regimes for all initial conditions and for
arbitrary values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The results suggest that for D>=3
there are regimes with realistic compactification originating from `generalized
Taub' solution. The endpoint of the compactification regimes is either
anisotropic exponential solution (for $\alpha > 0$, $\mu \equiv \beta/\alpha^2
< \mu_1$ (including entire $\beta < 0$)) or standard Kasner regime (for $\alpha
> 0$, $\mu > \mu_1$). For D>=8 there is additional regime which originates from
high-energy (cubic Lovelock) Kasner regime and ends as anisotropic exponential
solution. It exists in two domains: $\alpha > 0$, $\beta < 0$, $\mu \leqslant
\mu_4$ and entire $\alpha > 0$, $\beta > 0$. Let us note that for D>=8 and
$\alpha > 0$, $\beta < 0$, $\mu < \mu_4$ there are two realistic
compactification regimes which exist at the same time and have two different
anisotropic exponential solutions as a future asymptotes. For D>=8 and $\alpha
> 0$, $\beta > 0$, $\mu < \mu_2$ there are two realistic compactification
regimes but they lead to the same anisotropic exponential solution. This
behavior is quite different from the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet case. There are two
more unexpected observations among the results -- all realistic
compactification regimes exist only for $\alpha > 0$ and there is no smooth
transition from high-energy Kasner regime to low-energy one with realistic
compactification.

need technological means to make an optimal management of the waste collection

this article, we present a free intelligent software system, based on
computational learning algorithms, which plans the best routes for waste
collection supported by past (historical) and future (predictions) data.
  The objective of the system is the cost reduction of the waste collection
service by means of the minimization in distance traveled by any truck to
collect a container, hence the fuel consumption. At the same time the quality
of service to the citizen is increased avoiding the annoying overflows of
containers thanks to the accurate fill level predictions performed by BIN-CT.
In this article we show the features of our software system, illustrating it

to collect a container and therefore we obtain a reduction of total costs and

electronic systems. The entropy per particle is an important characteristic of
any many body system that tells how the entropy of the ensemble of electrons
changes if one adds one more electron. Recently, it has been demonstrated how
the entropy per particle of a two-dimensional electron gas can be extracted
from the recharging current dynamics in a planar capacitor geometry. These
experiments pave the way to the systematic studies of entropy in various
crystal systems including novel two-dimensional crystals such as gapped
graphene, germanene and silicene. Theoretically, the entropy per particle is
linked to the temperature derivative of the chemical potential of the electron
gas by the Maxwell relation. Using this relation, we calculate the entropy per
particle in the vicinity of topological transitions in various two-dimensional
electronic systems. We show that the entropy experiences quantized steps at the
points of Lifshitz transitions in a two-dimensional electronic gas with a
parabolic energy spectrum. In contrast, in doubled-gapped Dirac materials, the
entropy per particles demonstrates characteristic spikes once the chemical
potential passes through the band edges. The transition from a topological to
trivial insulator phase in germanene is manifested by the disappearance of a
strong zero-energy resonance in the entropy per particle dependence on the
chemical potential. We conclude that studies of the entropy per particle shed
light on multiple otherwise hidden peculiarities of the electronic band
structure of novel two-dimensional crystals.

assume a universal model of child growth. Such comparisons ignore population
differences that are independent of deprivation and health outcomes. This paper
partitions variation in height-for-age that is specifically associated with
deprivation and health outcomes to provide a basis for cross-population
comparisons.
  Materials & Methods: Using a multi-level model with a sigmoid relationship of
resources and growth, we partition variation in height-for-age z-scores (HAZ)
from 1,522,564 children across 70 countries into two components: 1) ""accrued
HAZ"" shaped by environmental inputs (e.g., undernutrition, infectious disease,
inadequate sanitation, poverty), and 2) a country-specific ""basal HAZ""
independent of such inputs. We validate these components against
population-level infant mortality rates, and assess how these basal differences
may affect cross-population comparisons of stunting.
  Results: Basal HAZ differs reliably across countries (range of 1.5 SD) and is
independent of measures of infant mortality. By contrast, accrued HAZ captures
stunting as impaired growth due to deprivation and is more closely associated
with infant mortality than observed HAZ. Ranking populations by accrued HAZ
suggest that populations in West Africa and the Caribbean suffer much greater
levels of stunting than suggested by observed HAZ.
  Discussion: Current universal standards may dramatically underestimate
stunting in populations with taller basal HAZ. Relying on observed HAZ rather
than accrued HAZ may also lead to inappropriate cross-population comparisons,
such as concluding that Haitian children enjoy better conditions for growth
than do Indian or Guatemalan children.

offline on the 1.25h labeled dataset to recognize the position and size of the
prey robot, in the field of view of the predator. During inference, combining
the ten output classes of the CNN allows extracting the analog position vector

Maria) has trained more than 600 undergraduate and 200 Ph.D. students, becoming
a reference in physics training at the Rio Grande do Sul central region. In
this work we present a gender analysis of the UFSM graduated students from both
levels. The number of graduated students of the female gender has been rising
with time and is significatively bigger than the number observed nationally in
both levels. The mean values are 35%, 37%, 28%, 42% e 39% for the courses
physics teaching (daytime), physics teaching (nightime), physics, master and
doctorate, respectively. We also observe an increase in the participation of
female students in graduate courses, when comparing to undergraduate courses,
unlike what is observed in the national average numbers. Considering only the
last 5 years the number of graduated students reaches 50% in the physics
teaching (daytime) and master courses. Although this study is of a local
nature, it reinforces the need for the dissemination of data regarding the
gender of graduates by all universities, allowing to conduct general gender
studies.

  fluid dynamics",,,"10.5334/jors.237",,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  FluidDyn is a project to foster open-science and open-source in the fluid
dynamics community. It is thought of as a research project to channel
open-source dynamics, methods and tools to do science. We propose a set of
Python packages forming a framework to study fluid dynamics with different
methods, in particular laboratory experiments (package fluidlab), simulations
(packages fluidfft, fluidsim and fluidfoam) and data processing (package
fluidimage). In the present article, we give an overview of the specialized
packages of the project and then focus on the base package called fluiddyn,
which contains common code used in the specialized packages. Packages fluidfft
and fluidsim are described with greater detail in two companion papers, Mohanan
et al. (2018a,b). With the project FluidDyn, we demonstrate that specialized
scientific code can be written with methods and good practices of the
open-source community. The Mercurial repositories are available in Bitbucket
(https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/). All codes are documented using Sphinx and
Read the Docs, and tested with continuous integration run on Bitbucket,
Pipelines and Travis. To improve the reuse potential, the codes are as modular
as possible, leveraging the simple object-oriented programming model of Python.
All codes are also written to be highly efficient, using C++, Cython and
Pythran to speedup the performance of critical functions.

results of a certain experiment constitute empirical evidence that we do not
live in, at least, one type of simulation. The type of simulation ruled out is
very specific. Perhaps that is the price one must pay to make any kind of
Popperian progress.

  regime",,,"10.1364/OE.26.030716",,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quill effect, one of the intriguing phenomena in ultrafast laser writing, to
our knowledge, has not been studied in low-loss-waveguide (LLW) writing regime
yet, probably due to its invisibility under conventional white-light microscope
in that regime. In this report, with help of adaptive third harmonic generation
microscopy we reveal the quill effect in LLW writing regime and study its
influences on the properties of written photonic integrated components in term
of polarization-related properties in fused silica and beam-splitting ratio of
three-waveguide-coupler in borosilicate glass.

  (2018)",,,"physics.data-an nlin.CD quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the presence of deep connections among dynamical equations,
experimental data, physical systems, and statistical modeling, we report on a
series of findings uncovered by the Authors and collaborators during the last
decade within the framework of the so-called Information Geometric Approach to
Chaos (IGAC). The IGAC is a theoretical modeling scheme that combines methods
of information geometry with inductive inference techniques to furnish
probabilistic descriptions of complex systems in presence of limited
information. In addition to relying on curvature and Jacobi field computations,
a suitable indicator of complexity within the IGAC framework is given by the
so-called Information Geometric Entropy (IGE). The IGE is an information
geometric measure of complexity of geodesic paths on curved statistical
manifolds underlying the entropic dynamics of systems specified in terms of
probability distributions. In this manuscript, we discuss several illustrative
examples wherein our modeling scheme is employed to infer macroscopic
predictions when only partial knowledge of the microscopic nature of a given
system is available. Finally, we include comments on the strengths and
weaknesses of the current version of our proposed theoretical scheme in our
concluding remarks.
