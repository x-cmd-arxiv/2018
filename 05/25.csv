1$ dimensions. Assuming that the environment is invariant under space-time
shifts and fulfills a mild mixing hypothesis, we establish a law of large
numbers and a concentration inequality around the asymptotic speed. The mixing
hypothesis imposes a polynomial decay rate of covariances on the environment
with sufficiently high exponent but does not impose uniform mixing. Examples of
environments for which our methods apply include the contact process and
Markovian environments with a positive spectral gap, such as the East model.
For the East model we also obtain that the distinguished zero satisfies a Law
of Large Numbers with strictly positive speed.

  Convolutional Neural Network Combining with Multi-level Features","Submit to PCM 2018",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the fact that characteristics of different sound classes are
highly diverse in different temporal scales and hierarchical levels, a novel
deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed for the
environmental sound classification task. This network architecture takes raw
waveforms as input, and a set of separated parallel CNNs are utilized with
different convolutional filter sizes and strides, in order to learn feature
representations with multi-temporal resolutions. On the other hand, the
proposed architecture also aggregates hierarchical features from multi-level
CNN layers for classification using direct connections between convolutional
layers, which is beyond the typical single-level CNN features employed by the
majority of previous studies. This network architecture also improves the flow
of information and avoids vanishing gradient problem. The combination of
multi-level features boosts the classification performance significantly.
Comparative experiments are conducted on two datasets: the environmental sound
classification dataset (ESC-50), and DCASE 2017 audio scene classification
dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective in
the classification tasks by employing multi-temporal resolution and multi-level
features, and it outperforms the previous methods which only account for
single-level features.

need to be designed, in particular ones that consider consumer preferences and
reality. Current auction mechanisms establish a time deadline for the auction

the final offering price. Consumers want to obtain the product as quickly as

always coincide with the seller's deadline. Naturally, consumers also want to
pay a price they consider ""fair"". Here we introduce an auction model where
buyers continuously place bids and the challenge is to decide quickly whether

and exhibits self-organized criticality; it presents a critical price from
which a bid is accepted with probability one, and avalanches of sales above
this value are observed. This model is of particular interest for startup

In previous studies, only the presence of massless poles in the

possibility for such poles to appear also in the corresponding ghost-gluon
vertex. Then, we solve the resulting Bethe-Salpeter system, which reveals that
the contribution associated with the poles of the ghost-gluon vertex is
suppressed with respect to those originating from the three-gluon vertex.

period closures accompanied by a decline of X-ray radiation in two models. We
review some of the previous works which are based on the well known dynamo
model in which the star is born with a period of a few milliseconds at high
temperatures. In such a convection regime the dynamo mechanism can amplify the
the magnetic fields to the magnetar value. This is in contrast to a screened
core model which posits that a high density phase transition occurs in the
inner core of magnetars that dynamically aligns all the neutron magnetic
moments producing a large magnetic field in the core. The accompanying change
of flux gives rise to shielding or screening currents in the surrounding high
conductivity plasma that do not permit the field to exit to the surface.
Ambipolar diffusion then transports the field to the crust dissipating energy
in neutrinos and X-rays. The up-welling field cleaves the crust resulting in
flares and X-ray radiation from ohmic dissipation in the crust till the
screening currents are spent and the surface polar field attains its final
value. In the dynamo model the polar magnetic field decreases with time whereas
in our screened model it increases to its final value. One consequence of this
is that in the latter model, as a function of time and period, the ratio of the
dipole radiation loss, $\dot E$ to the X-ray luminosity, $ L_X$, is a 'U'
curve, indicating that it is the exponential decline in $L_X$, that brings
closure to the periods that are observed for magnetars.

functional so introduced to characterize a natural extension $\Lambda[g]$ of
the Perelman's $\lambda(g)$--functional, and show that $\Lambda[g]$ is

to give rise to a gradient flow for a DeTurck modified RG-2 flow.

their mathematical properties as well as their applications to science and

$M$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and associates to each direction $v\in S^{d-1}$ a shape
summary obtained by scanning $M$ in the direction $v$. These shape summaries
are either persistence diagrams or piecewise constant integer-valued functions

conductances in the range 0.1 to 10 pWK$^{-1}$, and so have to rely on
diffusive phonon scattering in long, narrow, amorphous SiN$_\text{x}$ legs. We
show that it is possible to manufacture and operate TESs having short,
ballistic low-dimensional legs (cross section 500$\times$200 nm) that contain
multi-element phononic interferometers and ring resonators. These legs
transport heat in effectively just 5 elastic modes at the TES's operating
temperature (< 150 mK), which is close to the quantised limit of 4. The
phononic filters then reduce the thermal flux further by frequency-domain
filtering. For example, a micromachined 3-element ring resonator reduced the
flux to 19 % of a straight-legged ballistic device operating at the quantised
limit, and 38 % of a straight-legged diffusive reference device. This work
opens the way to manufacturing TESs where performance is determined entirely by
filtered, few-mode, ballistic thermal transport in short, low-heat capacity
legs, free from the artifacts of two level systems.

optics, it is easy to prepare initial superposition states of the coin, which
are always encoded by polarization states; while the preparation of
superposition states of the walker is challenging. Based on a novel encoding
method, we here propose a DTQW protocol in linear optics which enables the
preparation of arbitrary initial superposition states of the walker and the
coin. With this protocol, we report an experimental demonstration of DTQW with
the walker initially in superposition states, by using only passive
linear-optical elements. The effects of the walker's different initial
superposition states on the spread speed of the DTQW and on the entanglement
between the coin and the walker are also experimentally investigated, which
have not been reported before. When the walker starts with superposition
states, we show that the properties of DTQW are very different from those of
DTQW starting with a single position. Our findings reveal different properties
of DTQW and paves an avenue to study DTQW with arbitrary initial states.
Moreover, the encoding method enables one to encode an arbitrary
high-dimensional quantum state using a single physical qubit and may be adopted
to implement other quantum information tasks.

take ~5 million stars in the Galactic disk from the Gaia DR2 catalogue and
build the velocity distribution of many different Galactic Neighbourhoods
distributed along 5 kpc in Galactic radius and azimuth. We decompose their
distribution of stars in the V_R-V_phi plane with the wavelet transformation
and asses the statistical significance of the structures found. We detect many
kinematic sub-structures (arches and more rounded groups) that diminish their
azimuthal velocity as a function of Galactic radius in a continuous way,
connecting volumes up to 3 kpc apart in some cases. The decrease rate is, on
average, of ~23 km/s/kpc. In azimuth, the kinematic sub-structures present much
smaller variations. We also observe a duality in their behaviour: some conserve
their vertical angular momentum with radius (e.g., Hercules), while some seem
to have nearly constant kinetic energy (e.g., Sirius). These two trends are
consistent with the approximate predictions of resonances and of phase mixing,
respectively. Besides, the overall spatial evolution of Hercules is consistent
with being related to the Outer Lindblad Resonance of the Bar. We also detect
structures without apparent counterpart in the vicinity of the Sun. The various
trends observed and their continuity with radius and azimuth allows for future
work to deeply explore the parameter space of the models. Also, the
characterization of extrasolar moving groups opens the opportunity to expand

that the commonly used non-parametric bootstrapping (NPB) procedure can be
provably inefficient and establish a near-linear lower bound on the regret

with an appropriate amount of forced exploration can result in sub-linear

bootstrapping (WB) procedure. For Bernoulli rewards, WB with multiplicative
exponential weights is mathematically equivalent to Thompson sampling (TS) and
results in near-optimal regret bounds. Similarly, in the bandit setting with
Gaussian rewards, we show that WB with additive Gaussian weights achieves
near-optimal regret. Beyond these special cases, we show that WB leads to
better empirical performance than TS for several reward distributions bounded
on $[0,1]$. For the contextual bandit setting, we give practical guidelines
that make bootstrapping simple and efficient to implement and result in good

resolvable intrinsic timescales. In particular, they give access to the unitary
regime where the interactions are as strong as allowed by quantum mechanics.
Following years of experiments on unitary Fermi gases, unitary Bose gases have
recently emerged as a new experimental frontier. They promise exciting new
possibilities, including universal physics solely controlled by the gas density
and novel forms of superfluidity. Here, through momentum- and time-resolved
studies, we explore both degenerate and thermal homogeneous Bose gases quenched
to unitarity. In degenerate samples we observe universal post-quench dynamics
in agreement with the emergence of a prethermal state with a universal nonzero
condensed fraction. In thermal gases, dynamic and thermodynamic properties
generically depend on both the gas density $n$ and temperature $T$, but we find
that they can still be expressed in terms of universal dimensionless functions.
Surprisingly, the total quench-induced correlation energy is independent of the
gas temperature. Our measurements provide quantitative benchmarks and new
challenges for theoretical understanding.

or two lowest-lying states are split-off from rest of spectrum by large gap
that is controlled by varying $\Lambda$. For single split-off level, which
exists for the geometry with equal magnitudes but opposite signs of Robin
distances on confining interfaces, heat capacity $c_V$ of canonical averaging
is a nonmonotonic function of temperature $T$ with its salient maximum growing
to infinity as $\ln^2\Lambda$ for decreasing to zero extrapolation length and
its position being proportional to $1/(\Lambda^2\ln\Lambda)$. Specific heat per
particle $c_N$ of Fermi-Dirac ensemble depends nonmonotonically on temperature
too with its pronounced extremum being foregone on $T$ axis by plateau whose
value at dying $\Lambda$ is $(N-1)/(2N)k_B$, with $N$ being a number of

increases as $\Lambda$ goes to zero and is the largest for one particle. Most
essential property of Bose-Einstein ensemble is a formation, for growing number
of bosons, of sharp asymmetric shape on the $c_N-T$ characteristics that is
more protrusive at the smaller Robin distances. This cusp-like structure is a
manifestation of the phase transition to the condensate state. For two
split-off orbitals, one additional maximum emerges whose position is shifted to
colder temperatures with increase of energy gap between these two states and
their higher-lying counterparts and whose magnitude approaches
$\Lambda$-independent value. All these physical phenomena are qualitatively and
quantitatively explained by variation of energy spectrum by Robin distance.

successful in spite of the fact that several parts of the underlying quantum
field theoretical framework are analytically problematic. Indeed, it has long
been suggested, by Einstein, Schr\""odinger and others, that analytic problems
in the formulation of fundamental laws could be overcome by reformulating these
laws without reliance on analytic methods namely, for example, algebraically.
In this spirit, we focus here on the analytic ill-definedness of the quantum
field theoretic Fourier and Legendre transforms of the generating series of
Feynman graphs, including the path integral. To this end, we develop here
purely algebraic and combinatorial formulations of the Fourier and Legendre
transforms, employing rings of formal power series. These are all-purpose
transform methods and when applied in quantum field theory to the generating
functionals of Feynman graphs, the new transforms are well defined and thereby
help explain the robustness and success of the predictions of perturbative
quantum field theory in spite of analytic difficulties. Technically, we
overcome here the problem of the possible divergence of the various generating
series of Feynman graphs by constructing Fourier and Legendre transforms of
formal power series that operate in a well defined way on the coefficients of
the power series irrespective of whether or not these series converge. Our new
methods could, therefore, provide new algebraic and combinatorial perspectives
on quantum field theoretic structures that are conventionally thought of as
analytic in nature, such as the occurrence of anomalies from the path integral
measure.

superconductors, invariably involve an important role for correlations in the
spin and charge degrees of freedom. The most distinctive signature of this
state in the charge transport sector is a resistance that varies linearly in
temperature, but this phenomenon does not clearly point to one mechanism as
temperature is a scalar quantity that influences every possible mechanism for
momentum relaxation. In a previous work we identified an unusual scaling
relationship between magnetic field and temperature in the in-plane resistivity
of the unconventional superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$, providing
an opportunity to use the vector nature of the magnetic field to acquire
additional clues about the mechanisms responsible for scattering in the strange
metal state. Here we extend this work by investigating other components of the
conductivity tensor under different orientations of the magnetic field. We find
that the scaling phenomenon involves only the out-of-plane component of the
magnetic field and is, strikingly, independent of the direction of the applied
current. This suggests that the origin of the strange magnetotransport is in
the action of the magnetic field on the correlated behavior of spin and charge
degrees of freedom, rather than on the simple cyclotron motion of individual
quasiparticles.

the current filaments. Analytical estimates of the wavelength, growth rate and
saturation level of the resonant mode are derived and validated by
three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Furthermore, self-consistent
simulations of counter-streaming plasmas indicate that this drift-kink mode is
dominant in the slow down of the flows and in the isotropization of the
magnetic field, playing an important role in the formation of collisionless
shocks.

we perform a detailed collider study for the signature of $pp \rightarrow G'

coloron $G'$ as a six-jet resonance. For a light $\phi_I$ below around 0.5 TeV,
it may be boosted and behave as a four-prong fat jet. We also develop a
jet-substructure-based search strategy to cover this boosted $\phi_I$ case.
Independent of whether $\phi_I$ is boosted or not, the 13 TeV LHC with 100
fb$^{-1}$ has great discovery potential for a coloron with the mass sensitivity
up to 5 TeV.

imagery--has garnered recent attention due in part to compelling applications
in virtual and augmented reality. In this paper, we explore an intriguing
scenario for view synthesis: extrapolating views from imagery captured by
narrow-baseline stereo cameras, including VR cameras and now-widespread
dual-lens camera phones. We call this problem stereo magnification, and propose
a learning framework that leverages a new layered representation that we call
multiplane images (MPIs). Our method also uses a massive new data source for
learning view extrapolation: online videos on YouTube. Using data mined from
such videos, we train a deep network that predicts an MPI from an input stereo
image pair. This inferred MPI can then be used to synthesize a range of novel
views of the scene, including views that extrapolate significantly beyond the
input baseline. We show that our method compares favorably with several recent
view synthesis methods, and demonstrate applications in magnifying
narrow-baseline stereo images.

thermalize due to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the

lies in the system's entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to
measure. We realize such a many-body-localized system in a disordered
Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through
particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become
localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of
subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of non-local correlations,
whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy
- the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes
many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization
in non-interacting, disordered systems.

high-temperature gas which is already highly enriched in elements like carbon.
One of our quasar hosts is shown to be a close-separation ($<$2 arcsec) major

interpreted with caution as they could potentially be averaging over multiple

galaxies show a range of CO excitation properties spanning the full extent from
starburst-like to quasar-like spectral line energy distributions. We compare
gas masses based on CO, CI and dust emission, and find that these can disagree

triggered a growing interest in antiferromagnetic metal (AFM), and potential
high-density spintronic applications demand further improvements in the

newly discovered materials that possess massless Dirac fermions that are
protected by the crystalline symmetries. In this material, a reorientation of
the AF order may break the underlying symmetries and induce a finite energy
gap. As such, the possible phase transition from the semimetallic to insulating
phase gives us a choice for a wide range of resistance ensuring a large AMR. To
further understand the robustness of the phase transition, we study thermal
fluctuations of the AF order in AFS at a finite temperature. For macroscopic
samples, we find that the thermal fluctuations effectively decrease the
magnitude of the AF order by renormalizing the effective Hamiltonian. Our
finding suggests that the insulating phase exhibits a gap narrowing at elevated
temperatures, which leads to a substantial decrease in AMR. We also examine
spatially correlated thermal fluctuations for microscopic samples by solving
the microscopic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation finding a qualitative
difference of the gap narrowing in the insulating phase. For both cases, the
semimetallic phase shows a minimal change in its transmission spectrum
illustrating the robustness of the symmetry protected states in AFS. Our
finding may serve as a guideline for estimating and maximizing AMR of the AFS
samples at elevated temperatures.

Ribenboim's construction makes use of a special class of partially ordered
monoids and a special class of their subsets. While the restrictions he imposes
might seem conceptually unclear, we demonstrate that they are precisely the
appropriate conditions to represent such monoids as internal monoids in an
appropriate category of Ehrhard's finiteness spaces. Ehrhard introduced
finiteness spaces as the objects of a categorical model of classical linear
logic, where a set is equipped with a class of subsets to be thought of as
finitary. Morphisms are relations preserving the finitary structure. The notion
of finitary subset allows for a sharper analysis of computational structure
than is available in the relational model. For example, fixed point operators
fail to be finitary.
  In the present work, we take morphisms to be partial functions preserving the
finitary structure rather than relations. The resulting category is symmetric
monoidal closed, complete and cocomplete. Any pair of an internal monoid in
this category and a ring induces a ring of generalized power series by an
extension of the Ribenboim construction based on Ehrhard's notion of
linearization of a finiteness space. We thus further generalize Ribenboim's
constructions. We give several examples of rings which arise from this
construction, including the ring of Puiseux series and the ring of formal power
series generated by a free monoid.

until the mass reservoir of the disk is exhausted and dispersed, or condenses
into planetesimals. Accretion disks are intimately coupled with mass ejection
via polar cavities, in the form of jets and less collimated winds, which allow
mass accretion through the disk by removing a substantial fraction of its
angular momentum. Whether disk accretion is the mechanism leading to the
formation of stars with much higher masses is still unclear. Here, we are able
to build a comprehensive picture for the formation of an O-type star, by
directly imaging a molecular disk which rotates and undergoes infall around the
central star, and drives a molecular jet which arises from the inner disk
regions. The accretion disk is truncated between 2000-3000au, it has a mass of
about a tenth of the central star mass, and is infalling towards the central
star at a high rate (6x10^-4 Msun/yr), as to build up a very massive object.
These findings, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
at 700au resolution, provide observational proof that young massive stars can
form via disk accretion much like Solar-mass stars.

by the imposition of a background magnetic field aligned with the direction of
rotation. Understanding the physics behind the suppression may be important in
systems found in astrophysical fluid dynamics, such as stellar interiors.
However, the mechanism of suppression has not yet been explained. In the
idealized setting of a magnetized beta plane, we provide a theoretical
explanation that shows how magnetic fluctuations directly counteract the growth
of weak zonal flows. Two distinct calculations yield consistent conclusions.
The first, which is simpler and more physically transparent, extends the
Kelvin-Orr shearing wave to include magnetic fields and shows that weak,
long-wavelength shear flow organizes magnetic fluctuations to absorb energy
from the mean flow. The second calculation, based on the quasilinear,
statistical CE2 framework, is valid for arbitrary wavelength zonal flow and
predicts a self-consistent growth rate of the zonal flow. We find that a
background magnetic field suppresses zonal flow if the bare Alfven frequency is
comparable to or larger than the bare Rossby frequency. However, suppression
can occur for even smaller magnetic fields if the resistivity is sufficiently
small enough to allow sizable magnetic fluctuations. Our calculations reproduce
the $\eta/B_0^2 = \text{const.}$ scaling that describes the boundary of
zonation, as found in previous work, and we explicitly link this scaling to the
amplitude of magnetic fluctuations.

meet in the absence of inversion or time-reversal symmetry (TRS), or both.
Interesting phenomena are expected in WSMs such as the chiral magnetic effect,
anomalous Hall conductivity or Nernst effect, and unique quantum oscillations.
The TRS-broken WSM phase can be driven from a topological Dirac semimetal (DSM)
by magnetic field or magnetic dopants, considering that DSMs have degenerate
Weyl nodes stabilized by rotational symmetry, i.e. Dirac nodes. Here we develop
a Wannier-function-based tight-binding (WF-TB) model to investigate the
formation of Weyl nodes and nodal rings induced by B field in the topological
DSM Na$_3$Bi. The field is applied along the rotational axis. Remarkably, our
study based on the WF-TB model shows that upon B field each Dirac node is split
into four separate Weyl nodes along the rotational axis near the Fermi level;
two nodes with single chiral charge (single Weyl nodes) and two with double
chiral charge (double Weyl nodes). This result is in contrast to the common
belief that each Dirac node splits into two Weyl nodes. In the effective
models, the existence of double Weyl nodes ensures nonzero cubic terms in
momentum. We further examine the evolution of Fermi arcs at a side surface as a
function of chemical potential. The number of Fermi arcs is consistent with the
corresponding Fermi surface Chern numbers, corroborating our finding of the
double Weyl nodes. Furthermore, our study reveals the existence of nodal rings
in the mirror plane below the Fermi level upon B field. These nodal rings
persist with spin-orbit coupling, in contrast to typical nodal ring semimetals.
Our WF-TB model can be used to compute interesting features arising from Berry
curvature such as anomalous Hall and thermal conductivities, and our findings
can be applied to other topological DSMs like Cd$_3$As$_2$.

coherence. This proposition, correct in the case of a pure quantum state, is
not verified in the case of a mixed state. Here I analyze the consequences of
this fact for the second-order correlation function, $G ^{(2)}$, of electrons
injected on top of the Fermi sea with nonzero temperature. At zero temperature,
the function $G ^{(2)}$ unambiguously demonstrates whether the injected state
is a single- or a multi-particle state: $G^{(2)}_{}$ vanishes in the former
case, while it does not vanish in the latter case. However, at nonzero
temperatures, when the quantum state of injected electrons is a mixed state,
the purely single-particle contribution makes the function $G ^{(2)}_{}$ to be
non vanishing even in the case of a single-electron injection. The
single-particle contribution puts the lower limit to the second-order
correlation function of electrons injected into conductors at nonzero
temperatures. The existence of a single-particle contribution to $G ^{(2)}_{}$
can be verified experimentally by measuring the cross-correlation electrical
noise.

network is represented by a graph G=(V,E). Usually, the measure of complexity
that is considered in this model is the worst-case complexity, which is the
largest number of rounds performed by a vertex v\in V. While often this is a
reasonable measure, in some occasions it does not express sufficiently well the
actual performance of the algorithm. For example, an execution in which one
processor performs r rounds, and all the rest perform significantly less rounds
than r, has the same running time as an execution in which all processors
perform the same number of rounds r. On the other hand, the latter execution is
less efficient in several respects, such as energy efficiency, task execution
efficiency, local-neighborhood efficiency and simulation efficiency.
Consequently, a more appropriate measure is required in these cases. Recently,
the vertex-averaged complexity was proposed by \cite{Feuilloley2017}. In this
measure, the running time is the worst-case sum of rounds of communication
performed by all of the graph's vertices, averaged over the number of vertices.
Feuilloley \cite{Feuilloley2017} showed that leader-election admits an
algorithm with a vertex-averaged complexity significantly better than its
worst-case complexity. On the other hand, for O(1)-coloring of rings, the
worst-case and vertex-averaged complexities are the same. This complexity is
O\left(\log^{*}n\right) [12]. It remained open whether the vertex-averaged
complexity of symmetry-breaking in general graphs can be better than the
worst-case complexity. We answer this question in the affirmative, by showing a
number of results with improved vertex-averaged complexity.

$4\times10^{4}$ $^{7}\text{Li}$ atoms with loading rates up to approximately
$4\times10^{3}$ atoms per second. We study the Li desorption rate as a function
of the desorption wavelength and power. The extracted wavelength threshold for
desorption of Li from fused silica is approximately $470$ nm. In addition to
desorption of lithium, we observe light-induced desorption of background gas
molecules. The vacuum pressure increase due to the desorbed background
molecules is $\lesssim50$ % and the vacuum pressure decreases back to its base
value with characteristic timescales on the order of seconds when we extinguish
the desorption light. By examining both the loading and decay curves of the
magneto-optical trap, we are able to disentangle the trap decay rates due to
background gases and desorbed lithium. Our results show that light-induced
atomic desorption can be a viable Li vapor source for compact devices and

sensory information over time and facilitates long-term planning. Inferring an
agent's internal model is a crucial ingredient in social interactions (theory
of mind), for imitation learning, and for interpreting neural activities of
behaving agents. Here we describe a generic method to model an agent's behavior
under an environment with uncertainty, and infer the agent's internal model,
reward function, and dynamic beliefs. We apply our method to a simulated agent
performing a naturalistic foraging task. We assume the agent behaves rationally
--- that is, they take actions that optimize their subjective utility according
to their understanding of the task and its relevant causal variables. We model
this rational solution as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(POMDP) where the agent may make wrong assumptions about the task parameters.
Given the agent's sensory observations and actions, we learn its internal model
and reward function by maximum likelihood estimation over a set of
task-relevant parameters. The Markov property of the POMDP enables us to
characterize the transition probabilities between internal belief states and
iteratively estimate the agent's policy using a constrained
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We validate our method on simulated
agents performing suboptimally on a foraging task currently used in many
neuroscience experiments, and successfully recover their internal model and
reward function. Our work lays a critical foundation to discover how the brain
represents and computes with dynamic beliefs.

$A_\mu$ is the complex vector field and ${\bar A}_\mu$ is the complex conjugate

charge associated with the global $U(1)$ symmetry. We show that in comparison
with the case without the self-interaction $\lambda=0$, the maximal ADM mass
and Noether charge increase for $\lambda>0$ and decrease for $\lambda<0$. We
also show that there exists the critical central amplitude of the temporal
component of the vector field above which there is no vector BS solution, and
for $\lambda>0$ it can be expressed by the simple analytic expression. For a
sufficiently large positive coupling $\Lambda:=M_{pl}^2\lambda /(8\pi\mu^2) \gg
1$, the maximal ADM mass and Noether charge of the vector BSs are obtained from
the critical central amplitude and of ${\cal O}[\sqrt{\lambda}M_{pl}^3/\mu^2

${\cal O}(\sqrt{\lambda_\phi}M_{pl}^3/\mu_\phi^2)$, where $\lambda_\phi$ and

Adapting techniques developed in quantum metrology, we show that the action of
generic local noise processes -- though arbitrarily small -- always yields a
state whose Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) with respect to local observables
is linear in system size N, independent of the initial state. This implies that
all macroscopic quantum states, which are characterized by a QFI that is
quadratic in N, are fragile under decoherence, and cannot be maintained if the
system is not perfectly isolated. We also provide analytical bounds on the
effective system size, and show that the effective system size scales as the
inverse of the noise parameter p for small p for all the noise channels
considered, making it increasingly difficult to generate macroscopic or even
mesoscopic quantum states. In turn, we also show that the preparation of a
macroscopic quantum state, with respect to a conserved quantity, requires a
device whose QFI is already at least as large as the one of the desired state.
Given that the preparation device itself is classical and not a perfectly
isolated macroscopic quantum state, the preparation device needs to be
quadratically bigger than the macroscopic target state.

matrix based on specially designed measurements and the corresponding noisy
outcomes. In the last decade, numerous statistical methodologies have been
developed for efficiently recovering the unknown low-rank matrices. However, in
some applications, the unknown singular subspace is scientifically more
important than the low-rank matrix itself. In this article, we revisit the
low-rank matrix regression model and introduce a two-step procedure to
construct confidence regions of the singular subspace. The procedure involves
the de-biasing for the typical low-rank estimators after which we calculate the
empirical singular vectors. We investigate the distribution of the joint
projection distance between the empirical singular subspace and the unknown
true singular subspace. We specifically prove the asymptotical normality of the
joint projection distance with data-dependent centering and normalization when
$r^{3/2}(m_1+m_2)^{3/2}=o(n/\log n)$ where $m_1, m_2$ denote the matrix row and
column sizes, $r$ is the rank and $n$ is the number of independent random
measurements. Consequently, we propose data-dependent confidence regions of the
true singular subspace which attains any pre-determined confidence level
asymptotically. In addition, non-asymptotical convergence rates are also
established. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the merits of our
methods.

we find a set of inequality and equality constraints that characterize the

small study effects in multivariate meta-analysis. Two detailed case studies
are given to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed test over various naive
applications of univariate tests in practice. Through simulation studies, the
proposed test is found to retain nominal Type I error with considerable power

block copolymers, such as those used in lithography, where the stronger
interactions due to H-bonding can lead to a smaller period for the
self-assembled structures, allowing the production of higher resolution
templates. However, current statistical thermodynamic models used in
descriptions of microphase separation, such as the Flory-Huggins approach, do
not take into account some important properties of hydrogen bonding, such as
site specificity and cooperativity. In this combined theoretical and
experimental study, a step is taken toward the development of a more complete
theory of hydrogen bonding in polymers, using polyacrylamide as a model system.
We begin by developing a set of association models to describe hydrogen bonding
in amides. Both models with one association constant and two association
constants are considered. This theory is used to fit IR spectroscopy data from
acrylamide solutions in chloroform, thereby determining the model parameters.
These parameters are then employed to calculate the scattering function of the
disordered state of a diblock copolymer with one polyacrylamide block and one
non-hydrogen-bonding block in the random phase approximation. It is then shown
that the expression for the inverse scattering function with hydrogen bonding
is the same as that without hydrogen bonding, but with the Flory-Huggins
parameter $\chi$ replaced by an effective value
$\chi_\text{eff}=\chi+\delta\chi_\text{HB}\left(f\right)$, where the
hydrogen-bonding contribution $\delta\chi_\text{HB}$ depends on the volume
fraction $f$ of the hydrogen-bonding block. We find that models with two
constants give better predictions of bond energy in the acrylamide dimer and
more realistic asymptotic behavior of the association constants and
$\delta\chi_\text{HB}$ in the limit of high temperatures.

restricted settings. We provide a detailed complexity analysis of the model
checking problem for DEL, where we consider various combinations of
restrictions, such as the number of agents, whether the models are
single-pointed or multi-pointed, and whether postconditions are allowed in the
updates. In particular, we show that the problem is already PSPACE-hard in (1)
the case of one agent, multi-pointed S5 models, and no postconditions, and (2)
the case of two agents, only single-pointed S5 models, and no postconditions.

the ridge regression estimated linear probability model (LPM). To achieve this,
sequences from three similar post-translational modifications (PTMs) of
proteins occurring at, or very near, the S or T site are analyzed:
N-glycosylation, O-mucin type (O-GalNAc) glycosylation, and phosphorylation.
Results found include: 1) The consensus composite sequon for O-glycosylation
does NOT have W on either side of the glycosylation site. 2) The same holds for
the consensus sequon for phosphorylation. 3) For LPM estimation, N-glycosylated
sequences are found to be good approximations to non-O-glycosylatable
sequences. 4) The selective positioning of an amino acid along the sequence,
differentiates the PTMs of proteins. 5) Some N-glycosylated sequences are also
phosphorylated at the S or T site. 6) ASA values for N-glycosylated sequences
are stochastically larger than those for O-GlcNAc glycosylated sequences. 7)
Structural attributes (beta turn II, II', helix, beta bridges, beta hairpin,
and the phi angle) are significant LPM predictors of O-GlcNAc glycosylation.
The LPM with sequence and structural data as explanatory variables yields a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic value of 99%. 8) With only sequence data, the

beta are examined, comparing model to experiment. The plate growth velocity
depends sensitively both on the diffusivity D(T) of the rate-limiting species
and on the supersaturation around the growing plate. These result in a maxima
in growth velocity around 40 K below the transus, once sufficient
supersaturation is available to drive plate growth. In Ti-6246, the plate
growth velocity was found to be around 0.32 um min-1 at 850 oC, which was in
good agreement with the model prediction of 0.36 um min-1 . The solute field
around the growing plates, and the plate thickness, was found to be quite
variable, due to the intergrowth of plates and soft impingement. This solute
field was found to extend to up to 30 nm, and the interface concentration in
the beta was found to be around 6.4 at.% Mo. It was found that increasing O
content will have minimal effect on the plate lengths expected during
continuous cooling; in contrast, Mo approximately doubles the plate lengths
obtained for every 2 wt.% Mo reduction. Alloys using V as the beta stabiliser
instead of Mo are expected to have much faster plate growth kinetics at
nominally equivalent V contents. These findings will provide a useful tool for
the integrated design of alloys and process routes to achieve tailored
microstructures.

systems, relative energies of stationary points on potential energy
hypersurfaces need to be calculated to high accuracy. Due to the large number
of intermediates present in all but the simplest chemical processes,
approximate quantum chemical methods are required that allow for fast
evaluations of the relative energies, but at the expense of accuracy. Despite
the plethora of benchmark studies, the accuracy of a quantum chemical method is
often difficult to assess. Moreover, a significant improvement of a method's
accuracy (e.g., through reparameterization or systematic model extension) is
rarely possible. Here, we present a new approach that allows for the
systematic, problem-oriented, and rolling improvement of quantum chemical
results through the application of Gaussian processes. Due to its Bayesian
nature, reliable error estimates are provided for each prediction. A reference
method of high accuracy can be employed, if the uncertainty associated with a
particular calculation is above a given threshold. The new data point is then
added to a growing data set in order to continuously improve the model, and as
a result, all subsequent predictions. Previous predictions are validated by the
updated model to ensure that uncertainties remain within the given confidence
bound, which we call backtracking. We demonstrate our approach at the example
of a complex chemical reaction network.

classical model assumes that each project is offered by one lecturer and that

where ties are allowed in the preference lists of students and lecturers, which
we refer to as the Student-Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences

most robust definition of stability in this context, namely super-stability. We
describe the first polynomial-time algorithm to find a super-stable matching or
to report that no such matching exists, given an instance of SPA-ST. Our
algorithm runs in $O(L)$ time, where $L$ is the total length of all the

evaluation of the linear-time algorithm based on randomly-generated SPA-ST

elusive when ties are present in the students' and lecturers' preference lists,
the probability of such a matching existing is significantly higher if ties are

the general question of determining natural axioms concerning the truth

consist of Voyager 1 measurements up to several hundred MeV/nuc in local
interstellar space and measurements above ~10 GeV/nuc where solar modulation
effects are small by experiments on BESS, PAMELA and AMS-2. Using BESS and
PAMELA measurements which agree with each other, the observed spectra for H and
He nuclei and the H/He ratio are well fit by source rigidity spectra for both
nuclei which are ~P-2.24 over the entire range of rigidities corresponding to
energies between 10 MeV/nuc and several hundred GeV/nuc. In this case, the H/He
rigidity source ratio is 5.0 + 1. The recent and presumably more accurate
measurements of these spectra above 10 GeV/nuc made by AMS-2 do not entirely
agree with the earlier measurements, however. In particular the H spectrum is
found to be steeper than that of He by about 0.10 in the spectral exponent.
Using the same model for galactic propagation the AMS-2 data leads to source
spectra of H and He which are ~P-2.24 up to a break rigidity ~6-8 GV. At higher
rigidities the He source spectrum continues to be ~P-2.24 but the required
source spectrum for H steepens to an index ~P-2.36 above ~8 GV and, as a
result, the H/He source ratio decreases with increasing rigidity using the
AMS-2 data.

concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. It could be produced by unknown systematics or
by physics beyond the standard model. On the other hand, it is well known that
linear perturbation theory predicts a cosmic variance on the Hubble parameter
$H_0$, which leads to systematic errors on its local determination. Here, we
study how including in the likelihood the cosmic variance on $H_0$ affects
statistical inference. In particular we consider the $\gamma$CDM, $w$CDM and
$\gamma w$CDM parametric extensions of the standard model, which we constrain
with the latest CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, RSD and $H_0$ data. We learn two important
lessons. First, the systematic error from cosmic variance is - independently of
the model - approximately $\sigma_{\text{cv}}\approx 0.88$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ (1.2\% $H_0^{\text{loc}}$) when considering the redshift range
$0.0233 \le z \le 0.15$, which is relative to the main analysis of
(arXiv:1804.10655), and $\sigma_{\text{cv}}\approx 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
(2.1\% $H_0^{\text{loc}}$) when considering the wider redshift range $0.01 \le
z \le 0.15$. Although $\sigma_{\text{cv}}$ affects the total error budget on
local $H_0$, it does not significantly alleviate the tension which remains at
$\approx 3 \sigma$. Second, cosmic variance, besides shifting the constraints,
can change the results of model selection: much of the statistical advantage of
non-standard models is to alleviate the now-reduced tension. We conclude that,
when constraining non-standard models it is important to include the cosmic
variance on $H_0$ if one wants to use the local determination of the Hubble
constant by Riess et al. (arXiv:1804.10655). Doing the contrary could
potentially bias the conclusions.

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$ mode due to the weak-lensing (WL)
effect. The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter
perturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the
matter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is
affected by the MPS. Considering the effect of the ensemble average energy
density of the PMF, which we call ""the background PMF,"" on the MPS, the
amplitude of MPS is suppressed in the wave number range of $k>0.01~h$
Mpc$^{-1}$.The MPS affects the LP and the WL effect in the CMB $B$ mode;
however, the PMF can damp this effect. Previous studies of the CMB $B$ mode
with the PMF have only considered the vector and tensor modes. These modes
boost the CMB $B$ mode in the multipole range of $\ell > 1000$, whereas the
background PMF damps the CMB $B$ mode owing to the WL effect in the entire
multipole range. The matter density in the Universe controls the WL effect.
Therefore, when we constrain the PMF and the matter density parameters from
cosmological observational data sets, including the CMB $B$ mode, we expect
degeneracy between these parameters. The CMB $B$ mode also provides important
information on the background gravitational waves, inflation theory, matter
density fluctuations, and the structure formations at the cosmological scale
through the cosmological parameter search. If we study these topics and
correctly constrain the cosmological parameters from cosmological observations
including the CMB $B$ mode, we need to correctly consider the background PMF.

the main physical processes regulating evolution of different galaxy types. In
the era of a deluge of astrophysical information and recent progress in machine
learning, a new approach to galaxy classification becomes imperative.
  We employ a Fisher Expectation-Maximization unsupervised algorithm working in
a parameter space of 12 rest-frame magnitudes and spectroscopic redshift. The
model (DBk) and the number of classes (12) were established based on the joint
analysis of standard statistical criteria and confirmed by the analysis of the
galaxy distribution with respect to a number of classes and their properties.
This new approach allows us to classify galaxies based just on their redshifts
and UV-NIR spectral energy distributions.
  The FEM unsupervised algorithm has automatically distinguished 12 classes: 11
classes of VIPERS galaxies and an additional class of broad-line AGNs. After a
first broad division into blue, green and red categories we obtained a further
sub-division into three red, three green, and five blue galaxy classes. The FEM
classes follow the galaxy sequence from the earliest to the latest types that
is reflected in their colours (which are constructed from rest-frame magnitudes
used in classification procedure) but also their morphological, physical, and
spectroscopic properties (not included in the classification scheme). We
demonstrate that the members of each class share similar physical and spectral
properties. In particular, we are able to find three different classes of red
passive galaxy populations. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of an
unsupervised approach to galaxy classification and we retrieve the complexity
of galaxy populations at z~0.7, a task that usual simpler colour-based
approaches cannot fulfil.

for future large cosmology missions, such as Euclid or LSST. However, the
precision of classification is always lower in photometric surveys and can be
systematically biased with respect to classifications based upon spectroscopic
data. We verified how precisely the detailed classification scheme introduced
by Siudek et al. (2018, hereafter: S1) for galaxies at z~0.7 could be
reproduced if only photometric data are available. We applied the Fisher
Expectation-Maximization (FEM) unsupervised clustering algorithm to 54,293
VIPERS galaxies working in a parameter space of reliable photometric redshifts
and 12 corresponding rest-frame magnitudes. The FEM algorithm distinguishes
four main groups: (1) red, (2) green, (3) blue, and (4) outliers. Each group is
further divided into 3, 3, 4, and 2 subclasses, respectively. The accuracy of
reproducing galaxy classes using spectroscopic data is high: 92%, 84%, 96% for
red, green, and blue classes, respectively, except for dusty star-forming
galaxies. The presented verification of the photometric classification
demonstrates that large photometric samples can be used to distinguish
different galaxy classes at z > 0.5 with an accuracy provided so far only by
spectroscopic data except for particular galaxy classes.

about this galaxy is that X-ray diffuse observations suggest that NGC 1232
recently suffered a collision with a dwarf galaxy. We found an absence of star
formation around the region where the X-ray emission is more intense, which we
interpret as a star formation quenching due to the collision. Along with that,
we found an excess of star-forming regions in the northeast part of the galaxy,
where the X-ray emission is less intense.

periods for solar-age stars across a range of masses, potentially filling a
critical gap in the understanding of angular momentum loss in older main
sequence stars. The observation of M67 by NASA K2 Campaign 5 provided light
curves with high enough precision to make this task possible, albeit
challenging, as the pointing instability, 75d observation window, crowded
field, and typically low-amplitude signals mean determining accurate rotation
periods on the order of 25 - 30d is inherently difficult. Lingering,
non-astrophysical signals with power at >25d found in a set of Campaign 5 A and
F stars compounds the problem. To achieve a quantitative understanding of the
best-case scenario limits for reliable period detection imposed by these
inconveniences, we embarked on a comprehensive set of injection tests,
injecting 120,000 sinusoidal signals with periods ranging from 5 to 35d and
amplitudes from 0.05% to 3.0% into real Campaign 5 M67 light curves processed
using two different pipelines. We attempted to recover the signals using a
normalized version of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and setting a detection
threshold. We find that while the reliability of detected periods is high, the
completeness (sensitivity) drops rapidly with increasing period and decreasing
amplitude, maxing at 15% recovery rate for the solar case (i.e. 25d period,
0.1% amplitude). This study highlights the need for caution in determining M67
rotation periods from Campaign 5 data, but this can be extended to other
clusters observed by K2 and, soon, TESS.

All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). We use H$_2$ excitation diagrams to estimate the
range of masses and temperatures of warm molecular gas in these galaxies. We
find that LIRGs in which the IR emission originates mostly from the Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have about 100K higher H$_2$ mass-averaged excitation
temperatures than LIRGs in which the IR emission originates mostly from star
formation. Between 10 and 15\% of LIRGs have H$_2$ emission lines that are
sufficiently broad to be resolved or partially resolved by the high resolution
modules of Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Those sources tend to be
mergers and contain AGN. This suggests that a significant fraction of the H$_2$
line emission is powered by AGN activity through X-rays, cosmic rays, and
turbulence. We find a statistically significant correlation between the kinetic
energy in the H$_2$ gas and the H$_2$ to IR luminosity ratio. The sources with

However, even though it is an efficient method, it does not come at no

To combat the noise, most of the recent state-of-the-art approaches focus on
selecting one-best sentence or calculating soft attention weights over the set

suboptimal, and the false positive problem is still a key stumbling bottleneck

explore a deep reinforcement learning strategy to generate the false-positive

large dataset using gradient descent. The computation is carried out on a
distributed system consisting of a master node and multiple worker nodes. Such
distributed systems are significantly slowed down due to the presence of
slow-running machines (stragglers) as well as various communication
bottlenecks. We propose ""polynomially coded regression"" (PCR) that
substantially reduces the effect of stragglers and lessens the communication
burden in such systems. The key idea of PCR is to encode the partial data
stored at each worker, such that the computations at the workers can be viewed
as evaluating a polynomial at distinct points. This allows the master to
compute the final gradient by interpolating this polynomial. PCR significantly
reduces the recovery threshold, defined as the number of workers the master has
to wait for prior to computing the gradient. In particular, PCR requires a
recovery threshold that scales inversely proportionally with the amount of
computation/storage available at each worker. In comparison, state-of-the-art
straggler-mitigation schemes require a much higher recovery threshold that only
decreases linearly in the per worker computation/storage load. We prove that
PCR's recovery threshold is near minimal and within a factor two of the best
possible scheme. Our experiments over Amazon EC2 demonstrate that compared with
state-of-the-art schemes, PCR improves the run-time by 1.50x ~ 2.36x with
naturally occurring stragglers, and by as much as 2.58x ~ 4.29x with artificial

increase in the rate of growth of both temperature and radiative forcing
series. This was termed as the ""onset of sustained global warming"". The second
is related to the more recent so-called hiatus period, which suggests that
temperatures and total radiative forcing have increased less rapidly since the
mid-90s compared to the larger rate of increase from 1960 to 1990. There are
two issues that remain unresolved. The first is whether the breaks in the slope
of the trend functions of temperatures and radiative forcing are common. This
is important because common breaks coupled with the basic science of climate
change would strongly suggest a causal effect from anthropogenic factors to
temperatures. The second issue relates to establishing formally via a proper
testing procedure that takes into account the noise in the series, whether
there was indeed a `hiatus period' for temperatures since the mid 90s. This is
important because such a test would counter the widely held view that the
hiatus is the product of natural internal variability. Our paper provides tests
related to both issues. The results show that the breaks in temperatures and
radiative forcing are common and that the hiatus is characterized by a
significant decrease in their rate of growth. The statistical results are of
independent interest and applicable more generally.

  Sequences","Submitted to Medical Physics; 30 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vascular tracking of angiographic image sequences is one of the most
clinically important tasks in the diagnostic assessment and interventional
guidance of cardiac disease. However, this task can be challenging to
accomplish because of unsatisfactory angiography image quality and complex
vascular structures. Thus, this study proposed a new greedy graph search-based
method for vascular tracking. Each vascular branch is separated from the
vasculature and is tracked independently. Then, all branches are combined using
topology optimization, thereby resulting in complete vasculature tracking. A
gray-based image registration method was applied to determine the tracking
range, and the deformation field between two consecutive frames was calculated.
The vascular branch was described using a vascular centerline extraction method
with multi-probability fusion-based topology optimization. We introduce an
undirected acyclic graph establishment technique. A greedy search method was
proposed to acquire all possible paths in the graph that might match the
tracked vascular branch. The final tracking result was selected by branch
matching using dynamic time warping with a DAISY descriptor. The solution to
the problem reflected both the spatial and textural information between
successive frames. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method
was effective and robust for vascular tracking, attaining a F1 score of 0.89 on
a single branch dataset and 0.88 on a vessel tree dataset. This approach
provided a universal solution to address the problem of filamentary structure
tracking.

The training of an artificial neural network is a crucial step in its
application. However, currently on the integrated photonics platform there is
no efficient protocol for the training of these networks. In this work, we
introduce a method that enables highly efficient, in situ training of a
photonic neural network. We use adjoint variable methods to derive the photonic
analogue of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the standard method for
computing gradients of conventional neural networks. We further show how these
gradients may be obtained exactly by performing intensity measurements within
the device. As an application, we demonstrate the training of a numerically
simulated photonic artificial neural network. Beyond the training of photonic
machine learning implementations, our method may also be of broad interest to
experimental sensitivity analysis of photonic systems and the optimization of
reconfigurable optics platforms.

range (image) estimation of this function provided a set of inputs. By
discretizing the input set of the MLP into a finite number of hyper-rectangular
cells, our approach develops a linear programming (LP) based algorithm for
over-approximating the output set of the MLP with its input set as a union of
hyper-rectangular cells. Combining the over-approximation for the output set of
an MLP based controller and reachable set computation routines for ordinary
difference/differential equation (ODE) models, an algorithm is developed to
estimate the reachable set of the closed-loop system. Finally, safety
verification for neural network control systems can be performed by checking
the existence of intersections between the estimated reachable set and unsafe

$n$-vertex graph G, together with a set {(s_1,t_1),...,(s_k,t_k)} of pairs of
its vertices, called source-destination, or demand pairs, find a
maximum-cardinality set of mutually node-disjoint paths that connect the demand
pairs. The best current approximation for the problem is achieved by a simple
greedy $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation algorithm.
  A special case of the problem called NDP-Grid, where the underlying graph is
a grid, has been studied extensively. The best current approximation algorithm
for NDP-Grid achieves an $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$-approximation factor. On the
negative side, a recent result by the authors shows that NDP is hard to
approximate to within factor $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$, even if the
underlying graph is a sub-graph of a grid, and all source vertices lie on the
grid boundary. In a follow-up work, the authors further show that NDP-Grid is
hard to approximate to within factor $\Omega(2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}n})$ for any
constant $\epsilon$ under standard complexity assumptions, and to within factor
$n^{\Omega(1/(\log\log n)^2)}$ under randomized ETH.
  In this paper we study NDP-Grid, where all source vertices {s_1,...,s_k}
appear on the grid boundary. Our main result is an efficient randomized
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log n} \cdot \log\log n)}$-approximation algorithm for this
problem. We generalize this result to instances where the source vertices lie
within a prescribed distance from the grid boundary.
  Much of the work on approximation algorithms for NDP relies on the
multicommodity flow relaxation of the problem, which is known to have an
$\Omega(\sqrt n)$ integrality gap, even in grid graphs. Our work departs from
this paradigm, and uses a (completely different) linear program only to select
the pairs to be routed, while the routing itself is computed by other methods.

the functions can be indicator functions of arbitrary sets of shape parts, with

with valuable feedback from patients who reveal and express their medical
decision-making process, as well as self-reported quality of life indicators
both during and post treatment. In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have
studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of
tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online
public testimonies as ""Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes"" (iPROs), because
they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional
means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets
related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for
monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled
over 5.3 million ""breast cancer"" related tweets spanning September 2016 until
mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural
language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient
experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor
accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with
a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged
topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding
patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further
discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing
on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage.
Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss
their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment
needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare
professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.

promising translation performance recently. However, several studies indicate
that NMT often generates fluent but unfaithful translations. In this paper, we
propose a method to alleviate this problem by using a phrase table as
recommendation memory. The main idea is to add bonus to words worthy of
recommendation, so that NMT can make correct predictions. Specifically, we
first derive a prefix tree to accommodate all the candidate target phrases by
searching the phrase translation table according to the source sentence. Then,
we construct a recommendation word set by matching between candidate target
phrases and previously translated target words by NMT. After that, we determine
the specific bonus value for each recommendable word by using the attention
vector and phrase translation probability. Finally, we integrate this bonus
value into NMT to improve the translation results. The extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed methods obtain remarkable improvements over the
strong attentionbased NMT.

monoidal categories. The characterisation reduces the amount of data,

bicategorical account of that same fact; they characterise quantum categories
in terms of skew monoidal structures internal to a monoidal bicategory. A
quantum category is an opmonoidal monad on an enveloping monoidale
$R^\circ\otimes R$ in a monoidal bicategory. In a previous paper, we
characterised opmonoidal arrows on enveloping monoidales as a simpler structure
called oplax action.
  This is the second paper based on the author's PhD thesis. Here, motivated by
the fact that opmonoidal monads are monads in the bicategory of monoidales,
opmonoidal arrows, and opmonoidal cells; we prove that right skew monoidales
are ""monads of oplax actions"". To do so, we arrange oplax actions as the
1-simplices of a simplicial object in $\mathsf{Cat}$. In nice cases this
simplicial object is ought to be thought as a bicategory whose arrows are oplax
actions, that is to say, it is weakly equivalent to a nerve of a bicategory. We
define monads of oplax actions as simplicial maps out of the Catalan simplicial
set and prove that these are in bijective correspondence with right skew
monoidales whose unit has a right adjoint, no assumptions required on the

The degree of organization of a street structure determines the efficiency and
productivity of the city in that they act as blood vessels to transport people,
goods, and information. We analyze the topological aspect of a street network
using centralities including the betweenness, closeness, straightness, and
information. We classify the cities into several groups that share common
meta-information based on the centrality, indicating that the topological
factor of the street structure is closely related to meta-information through
coevolution. We also obtain the coevolution in the planned cities using the
regularity. Another footprint is the relation between the street segment length
and the population, which shows the sublinear scaling.

might influence how it spreads. Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring
networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to

the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider
comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205

the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five
popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and does
facilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a mechanism,
we then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models to simulate
the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of where an idea
originates on its longterm diffusion across the network. We find that research
from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of
similar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses
establish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the
quality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation. Our results establish
faculty hiring as an underlying mechanism that drives the persistent epistemic
advantage observed for elite institutions, and provide a theoretical lower

Then, our proposed model can learn the support correlation filter of each part

The different fission yields may be the reason for the antineutrino spectrum

continuous data like image and audio, in the most recent year, few deep graph
generative models have been proposed to generate discrete data such as graphs.
They are typically unconditioned generative models which has no control on
modes of the graphs being generated. Differently, in this paper, we are
interested in a new problem named \emph{Deep Graph Translation}: given an input
graph, we want to infer a target graph based on their underlying (both global
and local) translation mapping. Graph translation could be highly desirable in
many applications such as disaster management and rare event forecasting, where
the rare and abnormal graph patterns (e.g., traffic congestions and terrorism
events) will be inferred prior to their occurrence even without historical data
on the abnormal patterns for this graph (e.g., a road network or human contact
network). To achieve this, we propose a novel Graph-Translation-Generative
Adversarial Networks (GT-GAN) which will generate a graph translator from input
to target graphs. GT-GAN consists of a graph translator where we propose new
graph convolution and deconvolution layers to learn the global and local
translation mapping. A new conditional graph discriminator has also been
proposed to classify target graphs by conditioning on input graphs. Extensive
experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and scalability of the proposed GT-GAN.

and elucidate how disorder affects energy flow in 3D. For example, we show that
morphological boundaries in polycrystalline metal halide perovskites possess
lateral- and depth-dependent resistivities, blocking lateral transport for
surface but not bulk carriers. We furthermore reveal strategies to interpret
energy transport in disordered environments that will direct the design of
defect-tolerant materials for the semiconductor industry of tomorrow.

that both events have small Einstein radii of $\theta_{\rm E} = 0.12~{\rm

From Bayesian analyses, we find that these binaries have total system masses of

giant-planet/brown-dwarf pair (KMT-2016-BLG-1820), and a dark/faint object pair
(KMT-2016-BLG-2140) that are located near the deuterium-burning and
hydrogen-burning mass limits, respectively. Both lens systems are likely to be
in the Galactic disk with estimated distances of about $6$ kpc and $7$ kpc. The
projected lens-components separations are $1.1$ AU and $0.8$ AU, and the mass
ratios are $0.11$ and $0.20$. These prove that the microlensing method is
effective to identify these closely-separated very-low-mass binaries having low

calculated in the electrostatic and collisionless approximation, keeping the
geometry of the magnetic field arbitrary. In particular, the flux of electrons
and heavy impurity ions is studied in the limit where the former move quickly,
and the latter slowly, along the field compared with the mode frequency.
Conclusions are drawn about how the particle fluxes of these species depend on
the magnetic-field geometry, mode structure and frequency of the instability.
Under some conditions, such as everywhere favourable or unfavourable magnetic
curvature and modest temperature gradients, it is possible to make general
statements about the fluxes independently of the details of the instability. In
quasi-isodynamic stellarators with favourable bounce-averaged curvature for
most particles, the particle flux is always outward if the temperature gradient
is not too large, suggesting that it might be difficult to fuel such devices
with gas puffing from the wall. In devices with predominantly unfavourable
magnetic curvature, the particle flux can be inward, resulting in spontaneous
density peaking in the centre of the plasma. In the limit of highly charged
impurities, ordinary diffusion (proportional to the density gradient) dominates
over other transport channels and the diffusion coefficient becomes independent
of mass and charge. An estimate for the level of transport caused by
magnetic-field fluctuations arising from ion-temperature-gradient instabilities
is also given and is shown to be small compared with the electrostatic
component.

However, domain-specific tasks often do not have large in-domain corpora for
training high-quality domain embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel
lifelong learning setting for domain embedding. That is, when performing the
new domain embedding, the system has seen many past domains, and it tries to
expand the new in-domain corpus by exploiting the corpora from the past domains
via meta-learning. The proposed meta-learner characterizes the similarities of
the contexts of the same word in many domain corpora, which helps retrieve
relevant data from the past domains to expand the new domain corpus.
Experimental results show that domain embeddings produced from such a process

and white matter integrity and brain activity between/within subdivisions were
assessed. The thalamus was represented mainly in the dorsal and posterior
portions of the PMC, and the white matter tracts connecting these subdivisions
to the thalamus had less integrity in VS/UWS patients than in MCS patients and
healthy controls, as well as in patients who did not recover after 12 months
than in patients who did. The structural substrates were validated by finding
impaired functional fluctuations within this PMC subdivision. This study is the

challenging. It is commonly infeasible to sample a large number of trials, as
required by current reinforcement learning methods, in a physical environment.
This paper reports our project on using reinforcement learning for better
commodity search in Taobao, one of the largest online retail platforms and
meanwhile a physical environment with a high sampling cost. Instead of training
reinforcement learning in Taobao directly, we present our approach: first we
build Virtual Taobao, a simulator learned from historical customer behavior
data through the proposed GAN-SD (GAN for Simulating Distributions) and MAIL
(multi-agent adversarial imitation learning), and then we train policies in
Virtual Taobao with no physical costs in which ANC (Action Norm Constraint)
strategy is proposed to reduce over-fitting. In experiments, Virtual Taobao is
trained from hundreds of millions of customers' records, and its properties are
compared with the real environment. The results disclose that Virtual Taobao
faithfully recovers important properties of the real environment. We also show
that the policies trained in Virtual Taobao can have significantly superior
online performance to the traditional supervised approaches. We hope our work
could shed some light on reinforcement learning applications in complex
physical environments.

  applications for cardiac electrophysiology models",,,,,"stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mathematical models of biological systems are beginning to be used for
safety-critical applications, where large numbers of repeated model evaluations
are required to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
Most of these models are nonlinear both in variables and parameters/inputs
which has two consequences. First, analytic solutions are rarely available so
repeated evaluation of these models by numerically solving differential
equations incurs a significant computational burden. Second, many models
undergo bifurcations in behaviour as parameters are varied. As a result,
simulation outputs often contain discontinuities as we change parameter values
and move through parameter/input space.
  Statistical emulators such as Gaussian processes are frequently used to
reduce the computational cost of uncertainty quantification, but
discontinuities render a standard Gaussian process emulation approach
unsuitable as these emulators assume a smooth and continuous response to
changes in parameter values.
  In this article, we propose a novel two-step method for building a Gaussian
Process emulator for models with discontinuous response surfaces. We first use
a Gaussian Process classifier to detect boundaries of discontinuities and then
constrain the Gaussian Process emulation of the response surface within these
boundaries. We introduce a novel `certainty metric' to guide active learning
for a multi-class probabilistic classifier.
  We apply the new classifier to simulations of drug action on a cardiac
electrophysiology model, to propagate our uncertainty in a drug's action
through to predictions of changes to the cardiac action potential. The proposed
two-step active learning method significantly reduces the computational cost of
emulating models that undergo multiple bifurcations.

(R> 120,000) over a broad spectral range (90-390 nm). Its unique
spectropolarimetric capabilities will open-up a vast new parameter space, in
particular in the unexplored UV domain and in a regime where high-resolution
observations with current facilities in the visible domain are severely photon
starved. POLLUX will address a range of questions at the core of the LUVOIR
Science portfolio. The combination of high resolution and broad coverage of the
UV bandpass will resolve narrow UV emission and absorption lines originating in
diffuse media, thus permitting the study of the baryon cycle over cosmic time:
from galaxies forming stars out of interstellar gas and grains, and stars
forming planets, to the various forms of feedback into the interstellar and
intergalactic medium (ISM and IGM), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). UV
circular and linear polarimetry will reveal the magnetic fields for a wide
variety of objects for the first time, from AGN outflows to a diverse range of
stars, stellar explosions (both supernovae and their remnants), the ISM and
IGM. It will enable detection of polarized light reflected from exoplanets (or
their circumplanetary material and moons), characterization of the
magnetospheres of stars and planets (and their interactions), and measurements
of the influence of magnetic fields at the (inter)galactic scale. In this
paper, we outline the key science cases of POLLUX, together with its high-level

$\mu\tau$ interchange symmetries robustly constrain the Dirac CP phase $\delta$

$\delta$ and the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. We show how these well
known correlations will be changed if we generalize the $\mu\tau$ interchange
symmetry to a $\mu\tau$ mixing symmetry. In particular, we show that the
stringent condition of simultaneous maximality could be relaxed even with a
very small departure from the exact $\mu\tau$ interchange. In addition, the
present neutrino data on $\delta$ and $\theta_{23}$ can be explained better by
the mixing symmetry. After discussing the impact of the $\mu\tau$ mixing in
some realistic neutrino mass models, we show how the proposed mixing could be
realized with two simultaneous CP transformations which also lead to novel and
testable correlations between $\delta$ and the mixing angles $\theta_{ij}$.
Next we discuss in particular, the `three flavour regime' of leptogenesis
within the CP extended framework and show, unlike the ordinary CP extended
$\mu\tau$ interchange symmetry, a resonant leptogenesis is possible due the
generalization of $\mu\tau$ interchange to the $\mu\tau$ mixing and the
resulting baryon asymmetry always requires a nonmaximal $\theta_{23}$ owing to
the fact that the baryon to photon ratio $\eta_B$ vanishes in the exact limit
of $\theta_{23}=\pi/4$. This is one of the robust predictions of this
framework. The CP extended $\mu\tau$ mixing is also a novel example of a low
energy effective model that provides an important insight to the off-diagonal
terms of the flavour coupling matrix which have usually been neglected in

that the time-reversal operator $T$ is odd, $T^2=-1$. For $PT$-symmetric

problem have been studied to some degree, both of them controversially. In this
paper, we apply the basic methods proposed for bosonic systems to {\it
fermionic} two- and four-dimensional $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonians, and obtain
several surprising results: We find - in contrast to the bosonic case - that
the no-signaling principle is upheld for two-dimensional fermionic
Hamiltonians, however, the $PT$ symmetry is broken. In addition, we find that
the time required for the evolution from a given initial state, the spin-up, to
a given final state, the spin-down, is a constant, independent of the
parameters of the Hamiltonian, under the eigenvalue constraint. That is, it
cannot - as in the bosonic case - be optimized. We do, however, also find a
dimensional dependence: four-dimensional $PT$-symmetric fermionic Hamiltonians
considered here again uphold the no-signaling principle, but it is not
essential that the $PT$ symmetry be broken. The symmetry is, however, broken if
the measure of entanglement is conserved. In the four-dimensional systems, the
evolution time between orthogonal states is dependent on the parameters of the
Hamiltonian, with the conclusion that it again can be optimized, and approach
zero under certain circumstances. However, if we require the conservation of
entanglement, the transformation time between these two states becomes the same
constant as found in the two-dimensional case, which coincides with the minimum
time for such a transformation to take place in the Hermitian case.

inevitable trade-off between robustness and performance as a result of the
waterbed effect. Here reset control is introduced in the CRONE design to
overcome the fundamental limitations. In the new controller design, reset phase
advantage is approximated using describing function analysis and used to
achieve better open-loop shape. Sufficient quadratic stability conditions are
shown for the designed CRONE reset controllers and the control design is
validated on a Lorentz-actuated nanometre precision stage. It is shown that for
similar phase margin, better performance in terms of reference-tracking and
noise attenuation can be achieved.

Smoothing for state space models provides better estimation performance than
filtering by using the full posterior rather than the filtering density. In
multi-object state estimation, the Bayes multi-object filtering recursion
admits an analytic solution known as the Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli

its ability to map nodes into efficient low-dimensional embedding vectors.
However, two major limitations exist in state-of-the-art NE methods: role
preservation and uncertainty modeling. Almost all previous methods represent a
node into a point in space and focus on local structural information, i.e.,
neighborhood information. However, neighborhood information does not capture
global structural information and point vector representation fails in modeling
the uncertainty of node representations. In this paper, we propose a new NE
framework, struc2gauss, which learns node representations in the space of
Gaussian distributions and performs network embedding based on global
structural information. struc2gauss first employs a given node similarity
metric to measure the global structural information, then generates structural
context for nodes and finally learns node representations via Gaussian
embedding. Different structural similarity measures of networks and energy
functions of Gaussian embedding are investigated. Experiments conducted on
real-world networks demonstrate that struc2gauss effectively captures global
structural information while state-of-the-art network embedding methods fail
to, outperforms other methods on the structure-based clustering and

advantages in this context but are not commonly employed. Here we compare three
different estimation methods for the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model,
that has recently gained some popularity for characterizing whole-brain
connectivity. We first show that a Bayesian estimation of model parameters
assuming uniform priors is equivalent to an application of the method of
moments. Then, using synthetic data, we show that the Bayesian estimate scales
poorly with number of nodes in the network as compared to an iterative Lyapunov
optimization. In particular when the network size is in the order of that used
for whole-brain studies (about 100 nodes) the Bayesian method needs about eight
times more time samples than Lyapunov method in order to achieve similar
estimation accuracy. We also show that the higher estimation accuracy of
Lyapunov method is reflected in a much better classification of individuals
based on the estimated connectivity from a real dataset of BOLD fMRI. Finally
we show that the poor accuracy of Bayesian method is due to numerical errors,
when the imaginary part of the connectivity estimate gets large compared to its

can display coherence times for edge spins that diverge with the system size as
a consequence of almost conserved operators, the so-called strong zero modes.
Here, we discuss the fate of these coherence times when the system is perturbed
in two different ways. First, we consider the effects of a unitary coupling
connecting the ends of the chain; when the coupling is weak and
non-interacting, we observe stable long-lived harmonic oscillations between the
strong zero modes. Second, and more interestingly, we consider the case when
dynamics becomes dissipative. While in general dissipation induces decoherence
and loss of information, here we show that particularly simple environments can
actually enhance correlation times beyond those of the purely unitary case.
This allows us to generalise the notion of strong zero modes to irreversible
Markovian time-evolutions, thus defining conditions for {\em dissipative strong
zero maps}. Our results show how dissipation could, in principle, play a useful
role in protocols for storing information in quantum devices.

the FED of a system may be facilitated by considering instead another virtual

we show that by introducing an integrable virtual system, the evolution problem

variables are among the most difficult applications of robust optimization
(RO). The challenge in these problems is to find optimal here-and-now
decisions, taking into account that the wait-and-see decisions have to adapt to
the revealed values of the uncertain parameters. Postek and den Hertog (2016)
and Bertsimas and Dunning (2016) propose to solve these problems by
constructing piecewise constant decision rules by adaptively partitioning the
uncertainty set. The partitions of this set are iteratively updated by
separating so-called critical scenarios of the uncertain parameters. Both
references present methods for identifying these critical scenarios. However,
these methods are most suitable for problems with continuous decision variables
and many uncertain constraints. In particular, they are not able to identify
informative sets of critical scenarios for integer problems with uncertainty in
the objective function only. In this note, we address this shortcoming of
existing methods by introducing a general critical scenario detection method
for mixed-integer adjustable robust optimization problems that is based on the
branch-and-bound tree used to solve the corresponding static problem. Numerical
experiments on a route planning problem show that our general-purpose method
outperforms the problem-specific approach of Postek and den Hertog (2016).

  Technology Conference (VTC), Fall 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The long-haul communication systems can offer ultra high-speed data transfer
rates but suffer from burst errors. The high-rate and high-performance
staircase codes provide an efficient way for long-haul transmission. The
staircase coding scheme is a concatenation structure, which provides the
opportunity to improve the performance of high-rate polar codes. At the same
time, the polar codes make the staircase structure more reliable. Thus, a
high-rate polar-staircase coding scheme is proposed, where the systematic polar
codes are applied as the component codes. The soft cancellation decoding of the
systematic polar codes is proposed as a basic ingredient. The encoding of the
polar-staircase codes is designed with the help of density evolution, where the
unreliable parts of the polar codes are enhanced. The corresponding decoding is
proposed with low complexity, and is also optimized for burst error channels.
With the well designed encoding and decoding algorithms, the polar-staircase
codes perform well on both AWGN channels and burst error channels.

as an exogenous disturbance acting on the excitation frequency, perturbing the
excitation frequency from the natural frequency of the plant. We then discuss
the resonance tracking task in two parts: recursively identifying the frequency
disturbance and incorporating an update of the excitation frequency in the
algorithm. The complex representation of the system simplifies the design of
resonance tracking algorithms due to the applicability of well-established
techniques. We discuss the stability of the proposed scheme, even in cases that
seriously challenge current phase-based approaches, such as nonmonotonic phase
differences and multiple-input multiple-output systems. Numerical simulations
further demonstrate the performance of the proposed resonance tracking scheme.

target sets}. For a graph $G$ and an integer-valued threshold function $\tau$
on its vertex set, a {\it target set} or {\it dynamic monopoly} is a set of
vertices of $G$ such that iteratively adding to it vertices $u$ of $G$ that
have at least $\tau(u)$ neighbors in it eventually yields the entire vertex set
of $G$. This notion is limited to the binary choice of including a vertex in
the target set or not, and Cordasco et al.~proposed {\it partial incentives} as
a variant allowing for intermediate choices.
  We show that finding optimal partial incentives is hard for chordal graphs
and planar graphs but tractable for graphs of bounded treewidth and for
interval graphs with bounded thresholds. We also contribute some new results
about target set seletion on planar graphs by showing the hardness of this

simplified way, which allows us to proceed to heavier nuclei. Also we propose a
new effective interaction, V2m, where the triplet-even channel of the Volkov
No.2 interaction is weakened to 60% so as to reproduce the binding energy of
$^4$He after including the tensor term of a realistic interaction. Using AQCM-T

shown, which is almost comparable the central interaction, where $D$-state
mixes by 8% to the major $S$-state. The AQCM-T model with the new interaction

(LMXB) states. The spin-down rate in the LMXB state is only about 27 % greater
than in the RMSP state (Jaodand et al. 2016). The inner disk radius, r_in,
obtained recently by Ertan (2017) for the propeller phase, which is close to
the co-rotation radius, r_co, and insensitive to the mass-flow rate, can
explain the observed torques together with the X-ray luminosities, Lx . The
X-ray pulsar and radio pulsar states correspond to accretion with spin-down
(weak propeller) and strong propeller situations respectively. Several times
increase in the disk mass-flow rate takes the source from the strong propeller
with a low Lx to the weak propeller with a higher Lx powered by accretion on to
the star. The resultant decrease in r_in increases the magnetic torque
slightly, explaining the observed small increase in the spin-down rate. We have
found that the spin-up torque exerted by accreting material is much smaller
than the magnetic spin-down torque exerted by the disk in the LMXB state.

In this work, we study the space group constraints on photonic dispersions for

the unique singular point of photonic bands at zero frequency and momentum,
which distinguishes photonic bands from their electronic counterpart. The
results are given in terms of minimal band connectivities at zero~($M$) and
non-zero frequencies~($M'$). Topological band degeneracies are guaranteed to be

online social networks (OSN's) such as Twitter or Facebook to play a critical

is also evidence for directed manipulation of opinion with the help of social

manipulate the opinion-making process related to the Iranian protest in OSN by
employing social bots, and how such manipulations will affect the discourse as
a whole. Based on a sample of ca. 900,000 Tweets relating to the topic ""Iran""
we show, that there are Twitter profiles, that have to be considered as social
bot accounts. By using text mining methods, we show that these social bots are
responsible for negative sentiment in the debate. Thereby, we would like to

to a decrease or an increase of discrimination between groups after a major
cultural threat such as a terrorist attack. We propose an agent-based model of
cultural dynamics inspired from the social psychological theories. An agent has
a cultural identity comprised of the most acceptable positions about each of
the different cultural worldviews corresponding to the main cultural groups of
the considered society and a margin of acceptance around each of these most
acceptable positions. An agent forms an attitude about another agent depending
on the similarity between their cultural identities. When a terrorist attack is
perpetrated in the name of an extreme cultural identity, the negatively
perceived agents from this extreme cultural identity modify their margins of
acceptance in order to differentiate themselves more from the threatening
cultural identity. We generated a set of populations with cultural identities
compatible with data given by a survey on groups' attitudes among a large
sample representative of the population of France; we then simulated the
reaction of these agents facing a threat. For most populations, the average
attitude toward agents with the same preferred worldview as the terrorists
becomes more negative; however, when the population shows some cultural
properties, we noticed the opposite effect as the average attitude of the
population becomes less negative. This particular context requires that the
agents sharing the same preferred worldview with the terrorists strongly
differentiate themselves from the terrorists' extreme cultural identity and
that the other agents be aware of these changes.

illustrate the importance of considering the disordered magnetic state during
lattice relaxations by calculating formation energies and geometries for an Fe
vacancy and C insterstitial atom in bcc Fe as well as bcc Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$
random alloys in the paramagnetic state. In the vacancy case, the nearest
neighbors to the vacancy relax towards the vacancy of 0.16 {\AA} (-5% of the
ideal bcc nearest neighbor distance), which is twice as large as the relaxation
in the ferromagnetic case. The vacancy formation energy calculated in the DLM
state on these positions is 1.60 eV, which corresponds to a reduction of about
0.1 eV compared to the formation energy calculated using DLM but on
ferromagnetic-relaxed positions. The carbon interstitial formation energy is
found to be 0.41 eV when the DLM relaxed positions are used, as compared to
0.59 eV when the FM-relaxed positions are employed. For bcc

order to utilize the edges as ""fairly"" as possible. This turns out to be
equivalent to minimizing, with respect to $\mu$, the expected overlap of two

introduce the notion of homogeneous graphs. These are graphs for which it is
possible to choose a random spanning tree so that all edges have equal usage

commonly thought to be confined within a distance of the order of the
Thomas-Fermi length. The validity of this picture, which holds for surface
charges up to $\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, has been recently questioned by
several experimental results when dealing with larger surface charges, such as
those routinely achieved via the ionic gating technique. Whether these results
can be accounted for in a purely electrostatic picture is still debated. In
this work, we tackle this issue by calculating the spatial dependence of the
charge carrier density in thin slabs of niobium nitride via an ab initio
density functional theory approach in the field-effect transistor
configuration. We find that perturbations induced by surface charges $\lesssim
10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ are mainly screened within the first layer, while
those induced by larger surface charges $\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ can
penetrate over multiple atomic layers, in reasonable agreement with the
available experimental data. Furthermore, we show that a significant
contribution to the screening of large fields is associated not only to the
accumulation layer of the induced charge carriers at the surface, but also to
the polarization of the pre-existing charge density of the undoped system.

appears to host a diverse stellar population that is difficult to reconcile
with an instantaneous formation event. We present HST photometry and VLT
spectroscopy in order to improve observational constraints, finding the
Quintuplet to be far more homogeneous than previously thought. O7-8 Ia and
O9-B0 Ia supergiants form a smooth morphological sequence with a cohort of
seven early-B hypergiants and six luminous blue variables and WN9-11h stars,
which together comprise the richest population of such stars of any known
stellar aggregate. No further H-free Wolf-Rayets were found, resulting in a
13:1 ratio for WC/WN stars. However a small population of late-O hypergiants
and WN8-9ha stars was identified, while a subset of the supergiants are
unexpectedly faint, suggesting they are both less massive and older than the
greater cluster population. We find an impressive coincidence between cluster
members preceding the H-free WR phase and the evolutionary predictions for a
60Msun star, suggesting an age of ~3.0-3.6Myr for the Quintuplet. Neither the
late-O hypergiants nor the low luminosity supergiants are predicted; we suggest
that the former either result from rapid rotators or are the products of binary
driven mass-stripping, while the latter may be interlopers. The H-free WRs must
have had initial masses >60Msun, but it is difficult to reconcile their
observational properties with theoretical expectations. Since the WRs represent
an evolutionary phase directly preceding core-collapse, they are are crucial to
understanding both this process and the nature of the resultant relativistic
remnants, providing unique constraints on the evolution and death of the most
massive stars forming in the local, high metallicity Universe (Abridged).

of a superlattice with four atomic layers of STO and four layers of PTO

octahedral rotation, polarization, and interfaces on the E$_v$ are examined.
The formation energies vary layer-by-layer in the superlattices, with E$_v$
being higher in the ferroelectric phase than that in the paraelectric phase.
The two interfaces constructed in these oxide superlattices, which are
symmetrically equivalent in the paraelectric systems, exhibit very different
formation energies in the ferroelectric superlattices and this can be seen to
be driven by the coupling of ferroelectric and rotational modes. At equivalent
lattice sites, E$_v$ of charged vacancies is generally lower than that of
neutral vacancies. Octahedral rotations (a$^0$a$^0$c$^-$) in the FE
superlattice have a significant effect on the E$_v$, increasing the formation
energy of vacancies located near the interface but decreasing the formation
energy of the oxygen vacancies located in the bulk-like regions of the STO and

to calculate transient currents at a numerical cost that is independent of
temperature and band structure of the baths. We demonstrate the performance of
the extended HQME approach for noninteracting tight-binding model systems of
increasing complexity as well as for the spinless Anderson-Holstein model.

incorporates a realistic structure of haze particulates from small nano-size

previous works that radiative corrections, either at one-loop or through

an analogy with Higgs decay into fermions, we address the issue of infrared and
collinear divergences that plagues the cross section by adopting an effective

explicit expressions for the annihilation cross sections. We then develop
several approximations for the differential and total cross sections, which
simplify greatly their expressions, and which can then be used in various

by the multipoles of the two-point correlation function. In the nonlinear
regime, however, higher-order statistics are needed to capture the full
information of the galaxy density field. In this paper, we show that the
redshift-space line correlation function--which is a measure of Fourier phase
correlations--is sensitive to the nonlinear growth of the density and velocity
fields and to the nonlinear mapping between real and redshift space. We expand
the line correlation function in multipoles, and we show that almost all of the
information is encoded in the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole. We argue
that these multipoles are highly complementary to the multipoles of the
two-point correlation function: first, because they are directly sensitive to
the difference between the density and the velocity coupling kernels, which is
a purely nonlinear quantity; and second, because the multipoles are
proportional to different combinations of $f$ and $\sigma_8$. Measured in
conjunction with the two-point correlation function and the bispectrum, the
multipoles of the line correlation function could therefore allow us to
disentangle efficiently these two quantities and to test modified theories of

of geometric structures in order to match the input spectra. The generated
metamaterial patterns demonstrate high fidelity, yielding equivalent optical
spectra at an average accuracy of about 0.9. This approach reveals an
opportunity to expedite the discovery and design of metasurfaces for tailored
optical responses in a systematic, inverse-design manner.

of NO$\nu$A experiment leads to three nearly degenerate solutions. This
degeneracy can be understood in terms of deviations in $\nu_e$ appearance
signal, caused by unknown effects, with respect to the signal expected for a
reference set of oscillations parameters. We define the reference set to be
vacuum oscillations in the limit of maximal $\theta_{23}$ and no CP-violation.
We then calculate the deviations induced in the $\nu_e$ appearance signal event
rate by three unknown effects: (a) matter effects, due to normal or inverted
hierarchy (b) octant effects, due to $\theta_{23}$ being in higher or lower
octant and (c) CP-violation, whether $\delta_{CP} \sim - \pi/2$ or $\delta_{CP}
\sim \pi/2$. We find that the deviation caused by each of these effects is the
same for NO$\nu$A. The observed number of $\nu_e$ events in NO$\nu$A is
equivalent to the increase caused by one of the effects. Therefore, the
observed number of $\nu_e$ appearance events of NO$\nu$A is the net result of
the increase caused by two of the unknown effects and the decrease caused by
the third. Thus we get the three degenerate solutions. We also find that
further data by NO$\nu$A can not distinguish between these degenerate solutions
but addition of one year of neutrino run of DUNE can make a distinction between
all three solutions. The distinction between the two NH solutions and the IH
solution becomes possible because of the larger matter effect in DUNE. The
distinction between the two NH solutions with different octants is a result of
the synergy between the anti-neutrino data of NO$\nu$A and the neutrino data of
DUNE.

been trying to answer for the last seven decades. The formation of light
elements in the primordial universe and heavier elements in astrophysical
sources occurs through nuclear reactions. We can say that nuclear processes are
responsible for the production of energy and synthesis of elements in the
various astrophysical sites. Thus, nuclear reactions have a determining role in
the existence and evolution of several astrophysical environments, from the Sun
to the spectacular explosions of supernovae. Nuclear astrophysics attempts to
address the most basic and important questions of our existence and future.
There are still many issues that are unresolved such as, how stars and our
Galaxy have formed and how they evolve, how and where are the heaviest elements
made, what is the abundance of nuclei in the universe and what is the
nucleosynthesis output of the various production processes and why the amount
of lithium-7 observed is less than predicted. In this paper, we review our
current understanding of the different astrophysical nuclear processes leading
to the formation of chemical elements and pay particular attention to the
formation of heavy elements occurring during high-energy astrophysical events.
Thanks to the recent multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star
merger, which also confirmed production of heavy elements, explosive scenarios
such as short gamma-ray bursts and the following kilonovae are now strongly
supported as nucleosynthesis sites.

We can then estimate the specific density of states of the graphene
superlattice from the combined measurement of the critical current and the
normal state resistance. The result matches with theoretical predictions and
highlights the strong increase of the density of states at the van Hove
singularities. By measuring the magnetic field dependence of the supercurrent,
we find the presence of edge currents at these singularities. We explain it by
the reduction of the Fermi velocity associated with the flat band at the van
Hove singularity, which suppresses the supercurrent in the bulk while the
electrons at the edge remain less localized, resulting in an edge supercurrent.
We attribute this different behavior of the edges to defects or chemical
doping.

been used to transfer the stability of a narrow-linewidth I$_2$-stabilized

compare the optical frequency of the spectroscopy laser to an atomic clock

retroreflection quality, the Zeeman effect, and the ac Stark effect have been
considered during the analysis of the measured spectra; particularly in the

time between two strong measurements corresponding to pre- and post-selections.
The potent value can be realized for any interaction strength and for arbitrary
coupling between the system and the apparatus observables. Most importantly,
potent values generalize and unify the notion of the weak values and modular
values of observables in quantum theory. Furthermore, we define a potent
operator which describes the action of one system on the another and show that
superposition of time-evolutions and time-translation machines are potent
operators. These concepts may find useful applications in quantum information
processing and can lead to technological benefits.

exponential-time algorithm with relatively few training examples. Then we give
a particular classification task where learning a robust classifier is
computationally intractable. More precisely we construct a binary

On the other hand, Computer Vision has attempted at defining automatic
detection thresholds. This chapter sketches a procedure to confront these two
methodologies inspired in gestaltism. Using a computational quantitative
version of the non-accidentalness principle, we raise the possibility that the
psychophysical and the (older) gestaltist setups, both applicable on dot or
Gabor patterns, find a useful complement in a Turing test. In our perceptual
Turing test, human performance is compared by the scientist to the detection
result given by a computer. This confrontation permits to revive the abandoned
method of gestaltic games. We sketch the elaboration of such a game, where the
subjects of the experiment are confronted to an alignment detection algorithm,
and are invited to draw examples that will fool it. We show that in that way a
more precise definition of the alignment gestalt and of its computational
formulation seems to emerge. Detection algorithms might also be relevant to
more classic psychophysical setups, where they can again play the role of a
Turing test. To a visual experiment where subjects were invited to detect
alignments in Gabor patterns, we associated a single function measuring the
alignment detectability in the form of a number of false alarms (NFA). The
first results indicate that the values of the NFA, as a function of all
simulation parameters, are highly correlated to the human detection. This fact,
that we intend to support by further experiments , might end up confirming that
human alignment detection is the result of a single mechanism.

some previous work, to our knowledge, there does not exist a satisfactory
solution to this important problem. In this paper, we carefully detail the
problem and develop a novel approach to address it. Our idea is to impute the
hourly temperatures at the location of the measurements by borrowing
information from the nearby stations that record hourly temperatures, which
then can be used to create accurate summaries of temperature extremes. The key
difficulty is that these imputations of the temperature curves must satisfy the
constraint of falling between the observed daily minima and maxima, and
attaining those values at least once in a twenty-four hour period. We develop a
spatiotemporal Gaussian process model for imputing the hourly measurements from
the nearby stations, and then develop a novel and easy to implement Markov
Chain Monte Carlo technique to sample from the posterior distribution
satisfying the above constraints. We validate our imputation model using hourly
temperature data from four meteorological stations in Iowa, of which one is
hidden and the data replaced with daily minima and maxima, and show that the
imputed temperatures recover the hidden temperatures well. We also demonstrate
that our model can exploit information contained in the data to infer the time

justification of the fact that information is physical, is done by
inter-linking information and thermodynamics - through Landauer's principle.
This modern approach towards information recently has improved our
understanding of thermodynamics, both in classical and quantum domains. Here we
show thermodynamics as a consequence of information conservation. Our approach
can be applied to most general situations, where systems and thermal-baths
could be quantum, of arbitrary sizes and even could posses inter-system
correlations. The approach does not rely on an a priori predetermined
temperature associated to a thermal bath, which is not meaningful for
finite-size cases. Hence, the thermal-baths and systems are not different,
rather both are treated on an equal footing. This results in a
""temperature""-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We exploit the fact
that, for a fix amount of coarse-grained information, measured by the von
Neumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state that possesses
minimal energy, without changing its entropy. This state is known as a
completely passive state, which assumes Boltzmann-Gibb's canonical form with an
intrinsic temperature. This leads us to introduce the notions of bound and free
energy, which we further use to quantify heat and work respectively. With this
guiding principle of information conservation, we develop universal notions of
equilibrium, heat and work, Landauer's principle and also universal fundamental
laws of thermodynamics. We show that the maximum efficiency of a quantum
engine, equipped with a finite baths, is in general lower than that of an ideal
Carnot's engine. We also introduce a resource theoretic framework for
intrinsic-temperature based thermodynamics, within which we address the problem
of work extraction and state transformations.

ones that contain an instance of a visual query. Systems designed for visual
instance search face the major challenge of scalability: a collection of a few
million images used for instance search typically creates a few billion
features that must be indexed. Furthermore, as real image collections grow
rapidly, systems must also provide dynamicity, i.e., be able to handle on-line
insertions while concurrently serving retrieval operations. Durability, which
is the ability to recover correctly from software and hardware crashes, is the
natural complement of dynamicity. Durability, however, has rarely been
integrated within scalable and dynamic high-dimensional indexing solutions.
This article addresses the issue of dynamicity and durability for scalable
indexing of very large and rapidly growing collections of local features for
instance retrieval. By extending the NV-tree, a scalable disk-based
high-dimensional index, we show how to implement the ACID properties of
transactions which ensure both dynamicity and durability. We present a detailed
performance evaluation of the transactional NV-tree: (i) We show that the
insertion throughput is excellent despite the overhead for enforcing the ACID
properties; (ii) We also show that this transactional index is truly scalable
using a standard image benchmark embedded in collections of up to 28.5 billion
high-dimensional vectors; the largest single-server evaluations reported in the
literature.

unique characteristics that could be particularly important for diverse
applications including nuclear nonproliferation, spent nuclear fuel monitoring,
cargo scanning, and volcano imaging. The strong scattering dependence of muons
on atomic number Z in combination with high penetration range could offer a
significant advantage over existing techniques when dense, shielded containers
must be imaged. However, {\mu}CT reconstruction using conventional filtered
back-projection is limited due to the overly simple assumptions that do not
take into account the effects of multiple Coulomb scattering prompting the need
for more sophisticated approaches to be developed. In this paper, we argue that
the use of improved muon tracing and scattering angle projection algorithms as
well as use of an algebraic reconstruction technique should produce muon
tomographic images with improved quality or require fewer muons to produce the
same image quality compared to the case where conventional methods are used. We
report on the development and assessment of three novel muon tracing methods
and two new scattering angle projection methods for {\mu}CT. Simulated dry
storage casks with single and partial missing fuel assemblies were used as
numerical examples to assess and compare the proposed methods. The simulated
images showed an expected improvement in image quality when compared with more
conventional techniques, even without muon momentum information, which should
lead to improved detection capability, even for partial defects.

the far future. The dark fluid described by our parameterization behaves for

and dark matter using a single dark fluid, like in the case of the Chaplygin

match the best fit to the data. We study main cosmological properties of these

constrain these models to determine the cosmological parameters at the level of

agent is characterized by two portfolios; money invested in bonds and money
invested in stocks. Furthermore, each agent is faced with an optimization
problem in order to determine the optimal asset allocation. The stock price
evolution is driven by the aggregated investment decision of all agents. In
fact, we are faced with a differential game since all agents aim to invest
optimal. Mathematically such a problem is ill posed and we introduce the
concept of Nash equilibrium solutions to ensure the existence of a solution.
Especially, we denote an agent who solves this Nash equilibrium exactly a
rational agent. As next step we use model predictive control to approximate the
control problem. This enables us to derive a precise mathematical
characterization of the degree of rationality of a financial agent. This is a
novel concept in portfolio optimization and can be regarded as a general
approach. In a second step we consider the case of a fully myopic agent, where
we can solve the optimal investment decision of investors analytically. We
select the running cost to be the expected missed revenue of an agent and we
assume quadratic transaction costs. More precisely the expected revenues are
determined by a combination of a fundamentalist or chartist strategy. Then we
derive the mean field limit of the microscopic model in order to obtain a
macroscopic portfolio model. The novelty in comparison to existent
macroeconomic models in literature is that our model is derived from
microeconomic dynamics. The resulting portfolio model is a three dimensional
ODE system which enables us to derive analytical results. Simulations reveal,
that our model is able to replicate the most prominent features of financial
markets, namely booms and crashes.

number of methods have been proposed to accelerate spectral clustering, most of
them compromise considerable information loss in the original data for reducing
computational bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a novel scalable spectral
clustering method using Random Binning features (RB) to simultaneously
accelerate both similarity graph construction and the eigendecomposition.
Specifically, we implicitly approximate the graph similarity (kernel) matrix by
the inner product of a large sparse feature matrix generated by RB. Then we
introduce a state-of-the-art SVD solver to effectively compute eigenvectors of
this large matrix for spectral clustering. Using these two building blocks, we
reduce the computational cost from quadratic to linear in the number of data
points while achieving similar accuracy. Our theoretical analysis shows that
spectral clustering via RB converges faster to the exact spectral clustering
than the standard Random Feature approximation. Extensive experiments on 8
benchmarks show that the proposed method either outperforms or matches the

range of $E_b = 2A - 158 A$ GeV are analysed for this purpose, within a
generalised non boost-invariant blast wave model. The kinetic freeze out

monotonically with increasing longitudinal boost. The results would be useful
to understand the gross collision dynamics for the upcoming experiments at the
FAIR and NICA accelerator facilities.

have been developed which can achieve ~10 nm spatial resolution, i.e.
substantially beating the usual limits set by optical diffraction. However,
these methods rely on specialised labelling. This limits the applicability,
risks perturbing the biology, and it also makes them so-called ""discovery
techniques"" that can only be used when there is prior knowledge about the
biological problem. The alternative, electron microscopy (EM), requires complex
and time-consuming sample preparation, that risks compromising the sample's
integrity. Samples have to withstand vacuum, and staining with heavy metals to
make them conductive, and give usable electron-contrast. None of these
techniques can directly map out drug distributions at a sub-cellular level.
Recently infrared light-based scanning probe techniques have demonstrated a
capability for ~1 nm spatial resolution. However, they need samples that are
flat, dry and dimensionally stable and they only probe down to a depth
commensurate with the spatial resolution, so they yield essentially surface
chemical information. Thus far they have been applied only to artificially
produced test samples, e.g. gold particles, or isolated proteins on silicon.
Here we show how these probe-based techniques can be adapted for use with
routinely prepared general biological specimens. This allows for ""Mid-infrared
Chemical Nano-imaging"" (MICHNI) that delivers chemical analysis at a ~10 nm
spatial resolution, suitable for studying cellular ultrastructure. We
demonstrate its utility by performing label-free mapping of the anti-cancer
drug Bortezomib (BTZ) within a single human myeloma cell. We believe that this
MICHNI technique has the potential to become a widely applicable adjunct to EM
across the bio-sciences.

implications of EMU for the economic policy of France will be examined. If the
external force disappears, the public sector still cannot circumvent its
solvency constraint. The instrument of national monetary policy will not be
available so the absorption of asymmetric shocks will require greater wage
flexibility and fiscal policy will play a greater role. The paper includes

the usability of the mobile application, a one-hour training session was
administered in March of the 2017-2018 academic year to two groups of students
from a single class in the sixth grade of an Imam Hatip Secondary School

increased commercial interest in bifacial solar modules. A number of recent
publications have quantified the bifacial gain for several configurations. For
example, a standalone, optimally-tilted bifacial panel placed over a flat
ground (with 50% albedo) is expected to produce a bifacial energy gain of 30%
(per module area). In contrast, for a panel array in a solar farm, self and
mutual shading reduce the bifacial gain at the same tilt to 10-15% (per farm
area). Bifacial gain is negligible for vertical arrays--although the
configuration is of significant interest, since it can prevent soiling. Here,
we calculate the bifacial gain of a solar farm where vertical arrays have been
placed over sculpted/patterned ground. We conclude that vertical panels
straddling (upward) triangle-shaped ground maximizes the energy output. For
this optimum configuration, the bifacial gain can approach 50%, especially for
regions with moderate to high cloudy conditions. The enhanced output, along
with reduced soiling loss and lower cleaning cost of the ground sculpted
vertical bifacial (GvBF) solar farm could be of significant technological
interest, especially in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA), particularly susceptible to significant soiling losses.
