characterized by power-law temperature dependences of all observables, with
exponents related to those of the quantum critical point. Identifying
experimentally the quantum critical fan and its crossovers to the other regions

challenge. Focusing on paradigmatic models of quantum phase transitions, here
we show that quantum correlations - captured by the quantum variance of the
order parameter (I. Fr\'erot and T. Roscilde, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 94}, 075121

regime over an extended parameter region, much broader than that revealed by
ordinary correlations, and with well-defined crossovers to the other regimes.

in recent years, little effort has been dedicated to quantifying the quality of
the specifications used for synthesis. When dealing with unrealizable
specifications, finding the weakest environment assumptions that would ensure
realizability is typically a desirable property; in such context the weakness
of the assumptions is a major quality parameter. The question of whether one
assumption is weaker than another is commonly interpreted using implication or,
equivalently, language inclusion. However, this interpretation does not provide
any further insight into the weakness of assumptions when implication does not
hold. To our knowledge, the only measure that is capable of comparing two
formulae in this case is entropy, but even it fails to provide a sufficiently
refined notion of weakness in case of GR(1) formulae, a subset of linear
temporal logic formulae which is of particular interest in controller
synthesis. In this paper we propose a more refined measure of weakness based on
the Hausdorff dimension, a concept that captures the notion of size of the
omega-language satisfying a linear temporal logic formula. We identify the
conditions under which this measure is guaranteed to distinguish between weaker
and stronger GR(1) formulae. We evaluate our proposed weakness measure in the
context of computing GR(1) assumptions refinements.

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model, used for small superconducting grains,
and the spectrum of a paradigmatic model of Single Excitation Superradiance
(SES) is presented. They are both characterized by an equally spaced energy
spectrum (Picket Fence) where all the levels are coupled between each other by
a constant coupling which is real for the BCS model and purely imaginary for
the SES model. While the former corresponds to the discrete BCS-model
describing the coupling of Cooper pairs in momentum space and it induces a
Superconductive regime, the latter describes the coupling of single particle
energy levels to a common decay channel and it induces a Superradiant
transition. We show that the transition to a Superradiant regime can be
connected to the emergence of an imaginary energy gap, similarly to the
transition to a Superconductive regime where a real energy gap emerges. Despite
their different physical origin, it is possible to show that both the
Superradiant and the Superconducting gaps have the same magnitude in the large
gap limit. Nevertheless, some differences appear: while the critical coupling
at which the Superradiant gap appears is independent of the system size $N$,
for the Superconductivity gap it scales as $(\ln N)^{-1}$. The presence of a
gap in the imaginary energy axis between the Superradiant and the Subradiant
states shares many similarities with the ""standard"" gap on the real energy
axis: the superradiant state is protected against disorder from the imaginary
gap as well as the superconducting ground state is protected by the real energy
gap. Moreover we connect the origin of the gapped phase to the long-range
nature of the coupling between the energy levels.

characterization and analysis of latency variation and latency-reliability
trade-offs in modern DRAM chips, which was published in SIGMETRICS 2016, and
examines the work's significance and future potential.
  The goal of this work is to (i) experimentally characterize and understand
the latency variation across cells within a DRAM chip for these three
fundamental DRAM operations, and (ii) develop new mechanisms that exploit our
understanding of the latency variation to reliably improve performance. To this
end, we comprehensively characterize 240 DRAM chips from three major vendors,
and make six major new observations about latency variation within DRAM.
Notably, we find that (i) there is large latency variation across the cells for
each of the three operations; (ii) variation characteristics exhibit
significant spatial locality: slower cells are clustered in certain regions of
a DRAM chip; and (iii) the three fundamental operations exhibit different
reliability characteristics when the latency of each operation is reduced.
  Based on our observations, we propose Flexible-LatencY DRAM (FLY-DRAM), a
mechanism that exploits latency variation across DRAM cells within a DRAM chip
to improve system performance. The key idea of FLY-DRAM is to exploit the
spatial locality of slower cells within DRAM, and access the faster DRAM
regions with reduced latencies for the fundamental operations. Our evaluations
show that FLY-DRAM improves the performance of a wide range of applications by
13.3%, 17.6%, and 19.5%, on average, for each of the three different vendors'
real DRAM chips, in a simulated 8-core system.

reducing agent for the precursor (HAuCl4). Polyoxmetallate (PMo12O403-) capping
ligands stabilize gold nanoparticle deposits, facilitate their dispersion and
attachment to carbon supports. Indeed, it is apparent from the independent
diagnostic voltammetric experiments (in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4) that
heteropolymolybdates form readily stable adsorbates on nanostructures of both
gold and carbon (reduced graphene oxide and Vulcan). It is reasonable to expect
that the polyoxometallate-assisted nucleation of gold has occurred in the
proximity of oxygenated defects existing on carbon substrates. Under conditions
of electrochemical diagnostic experiments (performed in 0.1 mol dm-3 KOH): (i)
the phosphomolybdate adsorbates are removed from the interface as they undergo
dissolution in alkaline medium; and (ii) the Au nanoparticles (Au loading, 30

electron microscopy. High electrocatalytic activity of the reduced-graphene
oxide-supported Au nanoparticles toward reduction of oxygen in alkaline medium
is demonstrated using cyclic and rotating ring-disk voltammetric experiments.
Among important issues are possible activating interactions between gold and

prepends to each source sequence a politeness-score scaled label (predicted by

to the politeness classifier score of the sampled response. We also present two
retrieval-based polite dialogue model baselines. Human evaluation validates
that while the Fusion and the retrieval-based models achieve politeness with
poorer context-relevance, the LFT and Polite-RL models can produce
significantly more polite responses without sacrificing dialogue quality.

notion called the core, which generalizes well-studied notions of
proportionality and Pareto efficiency, and requires that each subset of agents
must receive an outcome that is fair relative to its size.
  In contrast to the case of divisible public goods (where fractional
allocations are permitted), the core is not guaranteed to exist when allocating
indivisible public goods. Our primary contributions are the notion of an
additive approximation to the core (with a tiny multiplicative loss), and
polynomial time algorithms that achieve a small additive approximation, where
the additive factor is relative to the largest utility of an agent for an
element. If the feasibility constraints define a matroid, we show an additive
approximation of 2. A similar approach yields a constant additive bound when
the feasibility constraints define a matching. More generally, if the
feasibility constraints define an arbitrary packing polytope with mild
restrictions, we show an additive guarantee that is logarithmic in the width of
the polytope. Our algorithms are based on variants of the convex program for
maximizing the Nash social welfare, but differ significantly from previous work
in how it is used. Our guarantees are meaningful even when there are fewer
elements than the number of agents. As far as we are aware, our work is the

of reduced-voltage operation in modern DRAM chips, which was published in
SIGMETRICS 2017, and examines the work's significance and future potential.
  We take a comprehensive approach to understanding and exploiting the latency
and reliability characteristics of modern DRAM when the DRAM supply voltage is
lowered below the nominal voltage level specified by DRAM standards. We perform
an experimental study of 124 real DDR3L (low-voltage) DRAM chips manufactured
recently by three major DRAM vendors. We find that reducing the supply voltage
below a certain point introduces bit errors in the data, and we comprehensively
characterize the behavior of these errors. We discover that these errors can be
avoided by increasing the latency of three major DRAM operations (activation,
restoration, and precharge). We perform detailed DRAM circuit simulations to
validate and explain our experimental findings. We also characterize the
various relationships between reduced supply voltage and error locations,
stored data patterns, DRAM temperature, and data retention.
  Based on our observations, we propose a new DRAM energy reduction mechanism,
called Voltron. The key idea of Voltron is to use a performance model to
determine by how much we can reduce the supply voltage without introducing
errors and without exceeding a user-specified threshold for performance loss.
Our evaluations show that Voltron reduces the average DRAM and system energy
consumption by 10.5% and 7.3%, respectively, while limiting the average system
performance loss to only 1.8%, for a variety of memory-intensive quad-core
workloads. We also show that Voltron significantly outperforms prior dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling mechanisms for DRAM.

(GPS) infrastructure, albeit there is an increasing demand for alternative
methods for GPS-denied environments. One of them is known as place recognition,
which associates images of places with their corresponding positions. We
previously proposed systems based on Weightless Neural Networks (WNN) to
address this problem as a classification task. This encompasses solely one part
of the global localization, which is not precise enough for driverless cars.
Instead of just recognizing past places and outputting their poses, it is
desired that a global localization system estimates the pose of current place
images. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem as follows. Firstly,
given a live image, the place recognition system returns the most similar image
and its pose. Then, given live and recollected images, a visual localization
system outputs the relative camera pose represented by those images. To
estimate the relative camera pose between the recollected and the current
images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the two images as
input and a relative pose vector as output. Together, these systems solve the
global localization problem using the topological and metric information to
approximate the current vehicle pose. The full approach is compared to a Real-
Time Kinematic GPS system and a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
system. Experimental results show that the proposed approach correctly
localizes a vehicle 90% of the time with a mean error of 1.20m compared to
1.12m of the SLAM system and 0.37m of the GPS, 89% of the time.

which was published in HPCA 2016, and examines the work's significance and

inefficiently, by transferring data from DRAM to the processor, and then back
to DRAM, across a narrow off-chip channel. The use of this narrow channel
results in high latency and energy consumption. Prior work proposes to avoid
these high costs by exploiting the existing wide internal DRAM bandwidth for
bulk data movement, but the limited connectivity of wires within DRAM allows
fast data movement within only a single DRAM subarray. Each subarray is only a
few megabytes in size, greatly restricting the range over which fast bulk data
movement can happen within DRAM.
  Our HPCA 2016 paper proposes a new DRAM substrate, Low-Cost Inter-Linked
Subarrays (LISA), whose goal is to enable fast and efficient data movement
across a large range of memory at low cost. LISA adds low-cost connections
between adjacent subarrays. By using these connections to interconnect the
existing internal wires (bitlines) of adjacent subarrays, LISA enables
wide-bandwidth data transfer across multiple subarrays with little (only 0.8%)
DRAM area overhead. As a DRAM substrate, LISA is versatile, enabling a variety
of new applications. We describe and evaluate three such applications in
detail: (1) fast inter-subarray bulk data copy, (2) in-DRAM caching using a
DRAM architecture whose rows have heterogeneous access latencies, and (3)
accelerated bitline precharging by linking multiple precharge units together.
Our extensive evaluations show that each of LISA's three applications

point visibility, in particular, searching for patterns in that 40 percent of
the lattice comprised of invisible points. One such pattern is a square patch,
an $n \times n$ grid of $n^2$ invisible points, which we call a hidden forest.
It is known that there exist arbitrarily large hidden forests in the integer

(CRT) on the rows and columns of matrices with prime number entries, and they
have only been able to locate hidden forests very far from the origin. For
example, using this method the closest known $4 \times 4$ hidden forest is over

differ greatly among the simulations suggesting a strong influence of the
typical DM halo mass, the number of satellites and the simulated baryonic

was published in HPCA 2017, and examines the work's significance and future
potential.
  SoftMC (Soft Memory Controller) is the first publicly-available DRAM testing
infrastructure that can flexibly and efficiently test DRAM chips in a manner
accessible to both software and hardware developers. SoftMC is an FPGA-based
testing platform that can control and test memory modules designed for the
commonly-used DDR (Double Data Rate) interface. SoftMC has two key properties:
(i) it provides flexibility to thoroughly control memory behavior or to
implement a wide range of mechanisms using DDR commands; and (ii) it is easy to
use as it provides a simple and intuitive high-level programming interface for
users, completely hiding the low-level details of the FPGA.
  We demonstrate the capability, flexibility, and programming ease of SoftMC
with two example use cases. First, we implement a test that characterizes the
retention time of DRAM cells. Second, we show that the expected latency
reduction of two recently-proposed mechanisms, which rely on accessing
recently-refreshed or recently-accessed DRAM cells faster than other DRAM
cells, is not observable in existing DRAM chips.
  Various versions of the SoftMC platform have enabled many of our other DRAM
characterization studies. We discuss several other use cases of SoftMC,
including the ability to characterize emerging non-volatile memory modules that
obey the DDR standard. We hope that our open-source release of SoftMC fills a
gap in the space of publicly-available experimental memory testing
infrastructures and inspires new studies, ideas, and methodologies in memory
system design.

companions constitute an important class of formation channels for merging BH
binaries detected by LIGO. We have studied the orbital and spin evolution of
binary BHs in triple systems, where the tertiary companion excites large
eccentricity in the inner binary through Lidov-Kozai oscillations, causing the
binary to merge via gravitational radiation. Using the single-orbital-averaged
and double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine
the merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner
binary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system
parameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with
the perturber eccentricity $e_{\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,
reaching $10-20\%$ at $e_{\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions
for the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole
effect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples. We also
follow the spin evolution of the BHs during the companion-induced orbital
decay. Starting from aligned spin axes, a wide range of final spin-orbit
misalignment angle $\theta_{\rm sl}^{\rm f}$ can be generated when the binary
enters the LIGO band. For systems where the octupole effect is small (such as
equal mass binaries or $e_{\rm out}\sim 0$), the distribution of $\theta_{\rm
sl}^{\rm f}$ peaks around $90^\circ$. As the octuple effect increases, a more
isotropic distribution of final spin axis is produced. Overall, merging BH
binaries produced by Lidov-Kozai oscillations in triples exhibit a unique
distribution of the effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}$; this may be used
to distinguish this formation channel from others.

dark matter paradigm to solve potential small-scale galaxy formation problems.
Nearly all self-interacting dark matter simulations so far have considered only
elastic collisions. Here we present simulations of a galactic halo within a
generic inelastic model using a novel numerical implementation in the Arepo
code to study arbitrary multi-state inelastic dark matter scenarios. For this
model we find that inelastic self-interactions can: (i) create larger subhalo
density cores compared to elastic models for the same cross section
normalisation; (ii) lower the abundance of satellites without the need for a
power spectrum cutoff; (iii) reduce the total halo mass by about 10%; (iv)
inject the energy equivalent of O(100) million Type II supernovae in galactic
haloes through level de-excitation; (v) avoid the gravothermal catastrophe due
to removal of particles from halo centers. We conclude that a ~5 times larger
elastic cross section is required to achieve the same central density reduction
as the inelastic model. This implies that well-established constraints on
self-interacting cross sections have to be revised if inelastic collisions are
the dominant mode. In this case significantly smaller cross sections can
achieve the same core density reduction thereby increasing the parameter space
of allowed models considerably.

pairs with proper transverse separations $R_\perp$$\leq$150 kpc and line of
sight velocity separations $\lesssim$11,000 km/s. We construct a stacked
ultraviolet (rest-frame wavelengths 700-2000\AA) spectrum of pairs corrected
for the intervening Lyman forest and Lyman continuum absorption. The observed
spectral composite presents a moderate flux excess for the most prominent broad
emission lines, a $\sim$30% decrease in flux at $\lambda$=800-900\AA\ compared
to a stack of brighter quasars not in pairs at similar redshifts, and lower
values of the mean free path of the HI ionizing radiation for pairs

quasars ($\lambda_{\rm mfp}^{912}=213.8\pm28~h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc) at the average

find a higher ($\sim$20%) incidence of proximate LLSs with $\log N_{\rm

These two rates are different at the 5$\sigma$ level. Moreover, we find that
optically-thick absorbers are equally shared between foreground and background
quasars. Based on these pieces of evidence, we conclude that there is a
moderate excess of gas absorbing Lyman continuum photons in our
closely-projected quasar pairs compared to single quasars. We argue that this
gas arises mostly within large-scale structures or partially neutral regions
inside the dark matter haloes where these close pairs reside.

dense stellar wind when one of the stars is in the AGB phase. Observations show
that many binaries that have undergone AGB mass transfer have orbital periods
of 1-10 yr, at odds with the predictions of binary population synthesis models.
We investigate the mass-accretion efficiency and angular-momentum loss via wind
mass transfer in AGB binary systems. We use these quantities to predict the
evolution of the orbit. We perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar
wind lost by an AGB star using the AMUSE framework. We approximate the thermal
evolution of the gas by imposing a simple effective cooling balance and we vary
the orbital separation and the velocity of the stellar wind. We find that for
wind velocities $v_{\infty}$ larger than the relative orbital velocity of the
system $v_\mathrm{orb}$ the flow is described by the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
approximation and the angular-momentum loss is modest, leading to an expansion
of the orbit. For low wind velocities an accretion disk is formed around the
companion and the accretion efficiency as well as the angular-momentum loss are
enhanced, implying that the orbit will shrink. We find that the transfer of
angular momentum from the orbit to the outflowing gas occurs within a few
orbital separations from the center of mass of the binary. Our results suggest
that the orbital evolution of AGB binaries can be predicted as a function of
the ratio $v_{\infty}/v_\mathrm{orb}$. Our results can provide insight into the
puzzling orbital periods of post-AGB binaries and suggest that the number of
stars entering into the common-envelope phase will increase. The latter can
have significant implications for the expected formation rates of the end
products of low-mass binary evolution, such as cataclysmic binaries, type Ia
supernova and double white-dwarf mergers. [ABRIDGED]

redshift most galaxies of all masses are asymmetric. By redshift $z\simeq 1.5$
the Hubble sequence is established and after this time most of the stellar mass

cosmic time but morphological transformations rearrange stars, thus
establishing the low-redshift morphological mix. Morphological transformations
are common and we quantify the rates at which they occur. The rate of growth of

cosmic ray ionization rate drops substantially to between $\zeta \approx

SNRs originates from decaying pions that are produced in collisions of the
interstellar gas and CRs. Using CR-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we show
that magnetic obliquity-dependent shock acceleration is able to reproduce the
observed TeV gamma-ray morphology of SNRs such as Vela Jr. and SN1006 solely by
varying the magnetic morphology. This implies that gamma-ray bright regions
result from quasi-parallel shocks (i.e., when the shock propagates at a narrow
angle to the upstream magnetic field), which are known to efficiently
accelerate CR protons, and that gamma-ray dark regions point to
quasi-perpendicular shock configurations. Comparison of the simulated gamma-ray
morphology to observations allows us to constrain the magnetic coherence scale
$\lambda_B$ around Vela Jr. and SN1006 to $\lambda_B \simeq 13_{-4.3}^{+13}$ pc
and $\lambda_B >200_{-10}^{+80}$ pc, respectively, where the ambient magnetic

consistent pure hadronic and mixed hadronic-leptonic models that both reproduce
the multi-frequency spectra from the radio to TeV gamma rays and match the

shock in a clumpy interstellar medium, we study the interaction of a shock with
a dense cloud with numerical simulations and analytics. We construct an
analytical gamma-ray model for a core collapse SNR propagating through a
structured interstellar medium, and show that the gamma-ray luminosity is only

three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of two idealized elliptical
galaxies -- one representing a typical galaxy characterized by initial
conditions conducive to the development of thermal instability and the other
one less likely to develop thermal instability -- in order to study the
development of thermal instability and the formation of multi-phase structures.
We analyze the interplay between radiative cooling, momentum-driven AGN
feedback, star formation, and stellar feedback from both young and old stars.
We find that in one class of elliptical galaxies, the entropy of the hot halo
gas rises sharply as a function of radius, and the hot halo is thermally stable
and run-away cooling can only happen in the very center of the galaxy. In other
class of ellipticals, the hot halo gas has a cooling to free-fall time ratio
close to 10, and the non-linear perturbation driven by AGN feedback can cause
the hot gas to frequently precipitate into extended multi-phase filaments. Both
multi- and single-phase elliptical galaxies experience cooling-driven AGN
feedback cycles. Interestingly, AGN feedback maintains the multi- or
single-phase nature of the halo but does not turn multi-phase galaxies into
single-phase ones or vice versa. Some of the extended cold gas in the
multi-phase galaxy also forms young stars. The level of star formation and its
spatial distribution are in excellent agreement with {\it Hubble} observations

a key role in many astrophysical transients, including classical novae and
young supernovae interacting with circumstellar material. The dense layer
behind high Mach number $\mathcal{M} \gg 1$ radiative shocks is susceptible to
thin-shell instabilities, creating a ""corrugated"" shock interface. We present
two and three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of optically-thin
radiative shocks to study their thermal radiation and acceleration of
non-thermal relativistic ions. We employ a moving-mesh code and a specialized
numerical technique to eliminate artificial heat conduction across grid cells.
The fraction of the shock's luminosity $L_{\rm tot}$ radiated at X-ray
temperatures $kT_{\rm sh} \approx (3/16)\mu m_p v_{\rm sh}^{2}$ expected from a
one-dimensional analysis is suppressed by a factor $L(>T_{\rm sh}/3)/L_{\rm
tot} \approx 4.5/\mathcal{M}^{4/3}$ for $\mathcal{M} \approx 4-36$. This
suppression results in part from weak shocks driven into under-pressured cold
filaments by hot shocked gas, which sap thermal energy from the latter faster
than it is radiated. Combining particle-in-cell simulation results for
diffusive shock acceleration with the inclination angle distribution across the
shock (relative to an upstream magnetic field in the shock plane$-$the expected
geometry for transient outflows), we predict the efficiency and energy spectrum
of ion acceleration. Though negligible acceleration is predicted for adiabatic
shocks, the corrugated shock front enables local regions to satisfy the
quasi-parallel magnetic field geometry required for efficient acceleration,
resulting in an average acceleration efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rm nth} \sim
0.005-0.02$ for $\mathcal{M} \approx 12-36$, in agreement with modeling of the

task in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving, robot
manipulation and augmented reality. Since 3D pose is a continuous quantity, a
natural formulation for this task is to solve a pose regression problem.
However, since pose regression methods return a single estimate of the pose,
they have difficulties handling multimodal pose distributions (e.g. in the case
of symmetric objects). An alternative formulation, which can capture multimodal
pose distributions, is to discretize the pose space into bins and solve a pose
classification problem. However, pose classification methods can give large
pose estimation errors depending on the coarseness of the discretization. In
this paper, we propose a mixed classification-regression framework that uses a
classification network to produce a discrete multimodal pose estimate and a
regression network to produce a continuous refinement of the discrete estimate.
The proposed framework can accommodate different architectures and loss
functions, leading to multiple classification-regression models, some of which
achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Pascal3D+ dataset.

used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine

successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a
Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to
model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and
movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular
deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and
movement processes, or to control one process while investigating the other.

mechanistic home ranges. 3. Here, we present the R-package amt (animal movement

article studies the operation of data links that employ incremental redundancy
as a practical means to protect information from the effects of unreliable
channels. Specifically, this work extends a powerful methodology termed
sequential differential optimization to choose near-optimal block sizes for
hybrid ARQ over erasure channels. In doing so, an interesting connection
between random coding and well-known constants in number theory is established.
Furthermore, results show that the impact of the coding strategy adopted and
the propensity of the channel to erase symbols naturally decouple when
analyzing throughput. Overall, block size selection is motivated by normal
approximations on the probability of decoding success at every stage of the
incremental transmission process. This novel perspective, which rigorously
bridges hybrid ARQ and coding, offers a pragmatic means to select code rates
and blocklengths for incremental redundancy.

variables for homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi-I spacetimes in $f(R)$
gravity in the presence of anisotropic matter. With a suitable choice of the
evolution parameter, the Einstein's equations are reduced to an autonomous
5-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for the new variables.
Further restrictions lead to considerable simplifications. For instance, we
show that for a large class of functions $f(R)$, which includes several cases
commonly considered in the literature, all the fixed points are polynomial
roots, and hence they can be determined with good accuracy and classified for
stability. Moreover, typically for these cases, any fixed point corresponding
to isotropic solutions in the presence of anisotropic matter will be unstable.
The assumption of a perfect fluid as source and or the vacuum cases imply some
dimensional reductions and even more simplifications. In particular, we find
that the vacuum solutions of $f(R) = R^{1+\delta}$, with $\delta$ a constant,
are governed by an effective bi-dimensional phase space which can be
analytically constructed, leading to an exactly soluble dynamics. Finally, we
demonstrate that several results already reported in the literature can be
re-obtained in a more direct and easy way by exploring our dynamical
formulation.

sparsity is controlled by the number of components. The bivariate kurtosis of
the PING process shows more components in the product results in thicker tail

the recent EDGES detection of the 21 cm global signal at frequencies
corresponding to $z\sim20$. The shape of the signal suggests that the spin
temperature of neutral hydrogen was coupled to the kinetic temperature of the
gas relatively rapidly ($19\lesssim z \lesssim 21$). We therefore consider
models in which the UV photons were dominantly produced in the rarest and most
massive halos ($M\gtrsim 10^9M_\odot$), since their abundance grows fast enough
at those redshifts to account for this feature of the signal. We show that
these models predict large power spectrum amplitudes during the inhomogeneous
coupling, and then inhomogeneous heating by CMB and Lyman-$\alpha$ photons due
to the large shot noise associated with the rare sources. The power spectrum is
enhanced by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous models which
did not include the shot noise contribution, making it a promising target for
upcoming radio interferometers that aim to detect high-redshift 21 cm

junctions at nonzero bias might be observed only at anomalously slow electron
tunneling through the barrier. The same applies to magnetic tunnel junctions
with a ferroelectric barrier also considered by Udalov et al: there is no
significant increase of the magnetoelectric effect due to image forces for
typical electron tunneling times. Udalov and Beloborodov completely missed the

jump-frequencies of probe atoms can be measured through relaxation of the
nuclear quadrupole interaction. This was first shown in 2004 for jumps of
tracer atoms that lead to reorientation of the local electric field-gradient,
such as jumps on the connected a-sublattice in the L12 crystal structure.
Studies on many such phases using the 111In/Cd PAC probe are reviewed in this
paper. A major finding from a 2009 study of indides of rare-earth elements,
In3R, was the apparent observation of two diffusional regimes: one dominant for
heavy-lanthanide phases, R= Lu, Tm, Er, Dy, Tb, Gd, that was consistent with a
simple model of vacancy diffusion on the In a-sublattice, and another for
light-lanthanides, R= La, Ce, Pr, Nd, that had no obvious explanation but for
which several alternative diffusion mechanisms were suggested. It is herein
proposed that the latter regime arises not from a diffusion mechanism but from
transfer of Cd-probes from In-sites where they originate to R-sites as a
consequence of a change in site-preference of 111Cd-daughter atoms from
In-sites to R-sites following transmutation of 111In. Support for this transfer
mechanism comes from a study of site-preferences and jump-frequencies of
111In/Cd probes in Pd3R phases. Possible mechanisms for transfer are described,
with the most likely mechanism identified as one in which Cd-probes on a-sites
transfer to interstitial sites, diffuse interstitially, and then react with
vacancies on b-sites. Implications of this proposal are discussed. For indides
of heavy-lanthanide elements, the Cd-tracer remains on the In-sublattice and
relaxation gives the diffusional jump-frequency.

Comparing the persistence diagram of a query with those of a database allows
automatic classification or retrieval, but unfortunately, the standard method
for comparing persistence diagrams, the bottleneck distance, has a high
computational cost. A possible algebraic solution to this problem is to switch
to comparisons between the complex polynomials whose roots are the cornerpoints
of the persistence diagrams. This strategy allows to reduce the computational
cost in a significant way, thereby making persistent homology based
applications suitable for large scale databases. The definition of new
distances in the polynomial frame-work poses some interesting problems, both of
theoretical and practical nature. In this paper, these questions have been
addressed by considering possible transformations of the half-plane where the
persistence diagrams lie onto the complex plane, and by considering a certain
re-normalisation the symmetric functions associated to the polynomial roots of
the resulting transformed polynomial. The encouraging numerical results,
obtained in a dermatology application test, suggest that the proposed method
may even improve the achievements obtained by the standard methods using
persistence diagrams and the bottleneck distance.

mounted on mobile platforms, is antenna position ambiguity. Approaches to
resolve this ambiguity and correct position errors are generally known as radar
autofocus. Common techniques that attempt to resolve the antenna ambiguity
generally assume an unknown gain and phase error afflicting the radar
measurements. However, ensuring identifiability and tractability of the unknown
error imposes strict restrictions on the allowable antenna perturbations.
Furthermore, these techniques are often not applicable in near-field imaging,
where mapping the position ambiguity to phase errors breaks down.
  In this paper, we propose an alternate formulation where the position error
of each antenna is mapped to a spatial shift operator in the image-domain.
Thus, the radar autofocus problem becomes a multichannel blind deconvolution
problem, in which the radar measurements correspond to observations of a static
radar image that is convolved with the spatial shift kernel associated with
each antenna. To solve the reformulated problem, we also develop a block
coordinate descent framework that leverages the sparsity and piece-wise
smoothness of the radar scene, as well as the one-sparse property of the two
dimensional shift kernels. We evaluate the performance of our approach using
both simulated and experimental radar measurements, and demonstrate its
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

mediated by adsorption to the cell surface, and receptor and coreceptor
binding. HIV-1 specifically targets CD4+ helper T-cells of the human immune
system and binds to the receptor CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 before fusion is
initiated. Previous experiments have been performed using a cell line

Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). By
means of the coronal seismology technique transport coefficients in hot
($\sim$10 MK) plasma were determined by Wang et al.(2015, Paper I), revealing
that thermal conductivity is nearly suppressed and compressive viscosity is
enhanced by more than an order of magnitude. In this study we use 1D nonlinear
MHD simulations to validate the predicted results from the linear theory and
investigate the standing slow-mode wave excitation mechanism. We first explore
the wave trigger based on the magnetic field extrapolation and flare emission
features. Using a flow pulse driven at one footpoint we simulate the wave
excitation in two types of loop models: model 1 with the classical transport
coefficients and model 2 with the seismology-determined transport coefficients.
We find that model 2 can form the standing wave pattern (within about one
period) from initial propagating disturbances much faster than model 1, in
better agreement with the observations. Simulations of the harmonic waves and
the Fourier decomposition analysis show that the scaling law between damping
time ($\tau$) and wave period ($P$) follows $\tau\propto{P^2}$ in model 2,
while $\tau\propto{P}$ in model 1. This indicates that the largely enhanced
viscosity efficiently increases the dissipation of higher harmonic components,
favoring the quick formation of the fundamental standing mode. Our study
suggests that observational constraints on the transport coefficients are
important in understanding both, the wave excitation and damping mechanisms.

and recovering read disturb errors in multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory,
which was published in DSN 2015, and examines the work's significance and
future potential. NAND flash memory reliability continues to degrade as the
memory is scaled down and more bits are programmed per cell. A key contributor
to this reduced reliability is read disturb, where a read to one row of cells
impacts the threshold voltages of unread flash cells in different rows of the
same block.
  For the first time in open literature, this work experimentally characterizes
read disturb errors on state-of-the-art 2Y-nm (i.e., 20-24 nm) MLC NAND flash
memory chips. Our findings (1) correlate the magnitude of threshold voltage
shifts with read operation counts, (2) demonstrate how program/erase cycle
count and retention age affect the read-disturb-induced error rate, and (3)
identify that lowering pass-through voltage levels reduces the impact of read
disturb and extend flash lifetime. Particularly, we find that the probability
of read disturb errors increases with both higher wear-out and higher
pass-through voltage levels.
  We leverage these findings to develop two new techniques. The first technique
mitigates read disturb errors by dynamically tuning the pass-through voltage on
a per-block basis. Using real workload traces, our evaluations show that this
technique increases flash memory endurance by an average of 21%. The second
technique recovers from previously-uncorrectable flash errors by identifying
and probabilistically correcting cells susceptible to read disturb errors. Our
evaluations show that this recovery technique reduces the raw bit error rate by
36%.

eigenvalue coincides with the ergodic constant of a risk-sensitive control
problem, or of an entropy game, in which the state space consists of all
switching sequences of a given length. We show that, by increasing this length,
we arrive at a convergent approximation scheme to compute the joint spectral

switching sequences, but it is quite insensitive to the size of the matrices,
allowing us to solve very large scale instances (several matrices in dimensions
of order 1000 within a minute). An idea of this method is to replace a
hierarchy of optimization problems, introduced by Ahmadi, Jungers, Parrilo and
Roozbehani, by a hierarchy of nonlinear eigenproblems. To solve the latter
eigenproblems, we introduce a projective version of Krasnoselskii-Mann

to the nonlinear eigenproblem for a monotone positively homogeneous map. Here,
this method allows for scalability by avoiding the recourse to linear or

which was published in the industrial session of HPCA 2017, and examines the
work's significance and future potential. Modern NAND flash memory chips use
multi-level cells (MLC), which store two bits of data in each cell, to improve
chip density. As MLC NAND flash memory scaled down to smaller manufacturing
process technologies, manufacturers adopted a two-step programming method to
improve reliability. In two-step programming, the two bits of a multi-level
cell are programmed using two separate steps, in order to minimize the amount
of cell-to-cell program interference induced on neighboring flash cells.
  In this work, we demonstrate that two-step programming exposes new
reliability and security vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art MLC NAND flash
memory. We experimentally characterize contemporary 1X-nm (i.e., 15--19nm)
flash memory chips, and find that a partially-programmed flash cell (i.e., a
cell where the second programming step has not yet been performed) is much more
vulnerable to cell-to-cell interference and read disturb than a
fully-programmed cell. We show that it is possible to exploit these
vulnerabilities on solid-state drives (SSDs) to alter the partially-programmed
data, causing (potentially malicious) data corruption. Based on our
observations, we propose several new mechanisms that eliminate or mitigate
these vulnerabilities in partially-programmed cells, and at the same time
increase flash memory lifetime by 16%.

where one Banach space can be identified with the dual space of the other). The
notion of generalized Banach Poisson manifolds introduced in this paper is

Banach Poisson-Lie groups, suitably generalized to the non-reflexive Banach

of software. In addition, they often exhibit brittle behavior: their
performance changes considerably with details of how the input program is
expressed-details that should be irrelevant, such as the order of independent
declarations. Such a lack of robustness frustrates users who have to spend
considerable time figuring out a tool's idiosyncrasies before they can use it
effectively.
  This paper introduces a technique to detect lack of robustness of program
verifiers; the technique is lightweight and fully automated, as it is based on
testing methods (such as mutation testing and metamorphic testing). The key
idea is to generate many simple variants of a program that initially passes
verification. All variants are, by construction, equivalent to the original
program; thus, any variant that fails verification indicates lack of robustness
in the verifier.
  We implemented our technique in a tool called ""mugie"", which operates on
programs written in the popular Boogie language for verification-used as
intermediate representation in numerous program verifiers. Experiments
targeting 135 Boogie programs indicate that brittle behavior occurs fairly
frequently (16 programs) and is not hard to trigger. Based on these results,
the paper discusses the main sources of brittle behavior and suggests means of
improving robustness.

reliable DR2 distances differ significantly from values in the literature, and
in most cases the Gaia DR2 distance is smaller. Two key results are that the S
Doradus instability strip may not be as clearly defined as previously thought,
and that there exists a population of LBVs at relatively low luminosities. LBVs
seem to occupy a wide swath from the end of the main sequence at the blue edge
to 8000 K at the red side, with a spread in luminosity reaching as low as
log(L/Lsun)=4.5. The lower-luminosity group corresponds to effective
single-star initial masses of 10-25 Msun, and includes objects that have been
considered as confirmed LBVs. We discuss implications for LBVs including (1)
their instability and origin in binary evolution, (2) connections to some
supernova (SN) impostors such as the class of SN 2008S-like objects, and (3)
LBVs that may be progenitors of SNe with dense circumstellar material across a
wide initial mass range. Although some of the Gaia DR2 distances for LBVs have
large uncertainty, this represents the most direct and consistent set of

cool AGB stars using the GALEX archive, we discovered a late-M star, Y Gem, to
be a source of strong and variable UV and X-ray emission. Here we report UV
spectroscopic observations of Y Gem obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope
that show strong flickering in the UV continuum on time-scales of <~20 s,
characteristic of an active accretion disk. Several UV lines with P-Cygni-type
profiles from species such as Si IV and C IV are also observed, with emission
and absorption features that are red- and blue- shifted by velocities of ~500
km/s from the systemic velocity. Our model for these (and previous)
observations is that material from the primary star is gravitationally captured
by a companion, producing a hot accretion disk. The latter powers a fast
outflow that produces blue-shifted features due to absorption of UV continuum
emitted by the disk, whereas the red-shifted emission features arise in heated
infalling material from the primary. The outflow velocities support a previous
inference by Sahai et al. (2015) that Y Gem's companion is a low-mass
main-sequence star. Blackbody fitting of the UV continuum implies an accretion
luminosity of about 13 Lsun and thus a mass-accretion rate >5e-7 Msun/yr; we
infer that Roche lobe overflow is the most likely binary accretion mode for Y
Gem.

in large data problems by data subsampling. SMC sequentially updates a cloud of
particles through a sequence of distributions, beginning with a distribution
that is easy to sample from such as the prior and ending with the posterior
distribution. Each update of the particle cloud consists of three steps:
reweighting, resampling, and moving. In the move step, each particle is moved
using a Markov kernel; this is typically the most computationally expensive
part, particularly when the dataset is large. It is crucial to have an
efficient move step to ensure particle diversity. Our article makes two
important contributions. First, in order to speed up the SMC computation, we
use an approximately unbiased and efficient annealed likelihood estimator based
on data subsampling. The subsampling approach is more memory efficient than the
corresponding full data SMC, which is an advantage for parallel computation.
Second, we use a Metropolis within Gibbs kernel with two conditional updates. A
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo update makes distant moves for the model parameters,
and a block pseudo-marginal proposal is used for the particles corresponding to
the auxiliary variables for the data subsampling. We demonstrate both the
usefulness and limitations of the methodology for estimating four generalized
linear models and a generalized additive model with large datasets.

studies to forecast the total number of hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin. Sea
surface temperature (SST) and latent heat flux (LHF) are correlated with
tropical cyclone occurrences, but this correlation is known to vary with
location and strength of the storm. The objective of this article is to
identify features of SST and LHF that can explain the spatial-temporal
variation of tropical cyclone counts, categorized by their strength. We develop
a variable selection procedure for multivariate spatial-temporally varying
coefficients, under a Poisson hurdle model (PHM) framework, which takes into
account the zero-inflated nature of the counts. The method differs from current
spatial-temporal variable selection techniques by offering a dynamic variable
selection procedure, that shares information between responses, locations, time
and levels in the PHM context. The model is used to study the association
between SST and LHF and the number of tropical cyclones of different strengths
in 400 locations in the Atlantic Basin over the period of 1950-2013. Results
show that it is possible to estimate the number of tropical storms by season
and region. Furthermore, the model delimits areas with a significant
correlation between SST and LHF features and the occurrence and strength of TCs

Alice and Bob do not share common randomness. Knowing Alice's encoding
strategy, an adversarial jammer James chooses a real-valued length-n noise
sequence $\mathbf{s}=s_1,..,s_n$ in a causal manner, i.e., each $s_t (1<=t<=n)$

transaction database that comprehensively describes the behaviour of the
vertex. A typical example is the social network, where the behaviour of every
user is depicted by a transaction database that stores his daily posted
contents. A transaction database is a set of transactions, where a transaction
is a set of items. Every path of the network is a sequence of vertices that
induces multiple sequences of transactions. The sequences of transactions
induced by all of the paths in the network forms an extremely large sequence
database. Finding frequent sequential patterns from such sequence database
discovers interesting subsequences that frequently appear in many paths of the
network. However, it is a challenging task, since the sequence database induced
by a database graph is too large to be explicitly induced and stored. In this
paper, we propose the novel notion of database graph, which naturally models a
wide spectrum of real world networks by associating each vertex with a

is divided and cognitive resources are at a premium. We aim to optimize the

propose the model of an idealized supervisor to describe human behavior. Such a

a safe set from this internal model using reachability theory. When a robot
leaves this safe set, the idealized supervisor will intervene to assist,
regardless of whether or not the robot remains objectively safe. False

needlessly consume supervisor attention. In this work, we propose a method that
decreases false positives by learning the supervisor's safe set and using that

  to the structure of sensory maps","36 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cs.NE q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces the concept of a bi-scale metric for use in the
cooperative phase of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. Use of a bi-scale
metric allows segmentation of the map into a number of regions, corresponding
to anticipated cluster structure in the data. Such a situation occurs, for
example, in the somatotopic maps which inspired the SOM algo- rithm, where
clusters of data may correspond to body surface regions whose general structure
is known. When a bi-scale metric is appropriately applied, issues with map
neurons that are not activated by any point in the training data are reduced or
eliminated. The paper also presents results of simulation studies on the
plasticity of bi-scale metric maps when they are retrained af- ter loss of
groups of map neurons or after changes in training data (such as would occur in
a somatotopic map when a body surface region like a finger is lost/removed).
The paper further considers situations where tri-scale met- rics may be useful,
and an alternative approach suggested by neurobiology, where some map regions
adapt more slowly to stimuli because they have a lower learning rate parameter.

between the communication rates are established when encoding is restricted to
random ensembles of homologous codes, namely, structured nested coset codes
from the same generator matrix and individual shaping functions, but when
decoding is optimized with respect to the realization of the encoders. For the
special case in which the desired linear combination is ""matched"" to the
structure of the multiple access channel in a natural sense, these inner and

schemes for computation in the literature that rely on random construction of
nested coset codes cannot be improved by using more powerful decoders, such as
the maximum likelihood decoder. The proof techniques are adapted to
characterize the rate region for broadcast channels achieved by Marton's

some features of the much more diverse Geometrical Relational Theories. In
contrast with the latter's (stratified) manifold relational spaces, the
former's are graphs: much simpler to treat; their edges encode topological
adjacency. We concentrate on Leibniz spaces, corresponding to indistinguishable

on CF approaches. However, structured knowledge exhibit unique advantages in
personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users
and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly
customized recommendations based on users' historical behaviors and the
knowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the
recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for
recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured data, while taking
advantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent
achievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem,
which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving
the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In
this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable

outcome $Y$ given a covariate vector $U$ is of primary importance in many
statistical applications such as prediction and personalized medicine. In some
problems, there is an additional auxiliary variable $Z$ in the training dataset
used to construct estimators, but $Z$ is not available for future prediction or
selecting patient treatment in personalized medicine. For example, in the
training dataset longitudinal outcomes are observed, but only the last outcome
$Y$ is concerned in the future prediction or analysis. The longitudinal
outcomes other than the last point is then the variable $Z$ that is observed
and related with both $Y$ and $U$. Previous work on how to make use of $Z$ in
the estimation of $E(Y|U)$ mainly focused on using $Z$ in the construction of a
linear function of $U$ to reduce covariate dimension for better estimation.
Using $E(Y|U) = E\{E(Y|U, Z)| U\}$, we propose a two-step estimation of inner
and outer expectations, respectively, with sufficient dimension reduction for
kernel estimation in both steps. The information from $Z$ is utilized not only
in dimension reduction, but also directly in the estimation. Because of the
existence of different ways for dimension reduction, we construct two
estimators that may improve the estimator without using $Z$. The improvements
are shown in the convergence rate of estimators as the sample size increases to
infinity as well as in the finite sample simulation performance. A real data
analysis about the selection of mammography intervention is presented for
illustration.

development in deep generative models enables an efficient end-to-end framework

this problem, we propose to introduce the semantic segmentation information,
which disentangles the inter-class difference and intra-class variation for
image inpainting. This leads to much clearer recovered boundary between
semantically different regions and better texture within semantically
consistent segments. Our model factorizes the image inpainting process into
segmentation prediction (SP-Net) and segmentation guidance (SG-Net) as two
steps, which predict the segmentation labels in the missing area first, and
then generate segmentation guided inpainting results. Experiments on multiple
public datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in
optimizing the image inpainting quality, and the interactive segmentation
guidance provides possibilities for multi-modal predictions of image
inpainting.

  Hypergraphs",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a graph, a maximal independent set (MIS) is a maximal subset of
pairwise non-adjacent vertices. Finding an MIS is a fundamental problem in
distributed computing. Although the problem is extensively studied and well
understood in simple graphs, our knowledge is still quite limited when solving
it in hypergraphs, especially in the distributed CONGEST model. In this paper,
we focus on linear hypergraphs---a class of hypergraphs in which any two
hyperedges overlap on at most one node.
  We first present a randomized algorithm for computing an MIS in linear
hypergraphs. It has poly-logarithmic runtime and it works in the CONGEST model.
The algorithm uses a network decomposition to achieve fast parallel processing.
Within each cluster of the decomposition, we run a distributed variant of a
parallel hypergraph MIS algorithm by Luczak and Szymanska.
  We then propose the concept of a generalized maximal independent set (GMIS)
as an extension to the classical MIS in hypergraphs. More specifically, in a
GMIS, for each hyperedge $e$ in a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, we associate an
integer threshold $t_e$ in the range $[1, |e|-1]$, and the goal is to find a
maximal subset $\mathcal{I}$ of vertices that do not violate any threshold
constraints: $\forall e \in E(\mathcal{H}), |e \cap \mathcal{I}| \leq t_e$. We
hope that GMIS might capture a broader class of real-world problems than MIS;
we also believe that GMIS is an interesting and challenging symmetry breaking
problem on its own.
  Our second upper bound result is a distributed algorithm for computing a GMIS
in linear hypergraphs, subject to the constraint that the maximum hyperedge
size is bounded by some constant. Again, the algorithm has poly-logarithmic
runtime and it works in the CONGEST model. It is obtained by generalizing our
previous (linear) hypergraph MIS algorithm.

no-fly zone setup by authorities that makes airspace unusable. Thus, proper
pre-departure planning that avoids such places is needed.
  In this paper, we formulate this problem into a Constraint Satisfaction
Problem to find a collision-free shortest path on a dynamic graph. We propose a
collision-free path planning algorithm that is based on A* algorithm. The main
novelty is that we invent a heuristic function that also considers waiting
time. We later show that, with added waiting penalty, the proposed algorithm is
optimal because the heuristic is admissible. Implementation of this algorithm
simulates UAV delivery using Singapore's airspace structure. Our simulation
exhibits desirable runtime performance. Using the proposed algorithm, the
percentage of collision-free routes decreases as number of requests per unit

efficient face detection models with a high detection accuracy. Specifically,
comparing with a popular CNN-based cascade face detector MTCNN [2], our anchor
cascade face detector greatly improves the detection accuracy, e.g., from
0.9435 to 0.9704 at 1k false positives on FDDB, while it still runs in

weakly and strongly magnetized accretion flow. We focus on how the magnetic
field strength affects the wind properties. We solve time-steady
two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations of black hole accretion in
the presence of large-scale magnetic field. We assume self-similarity in radial
direction. The magnetic field is assumed to be evenly symmetric with the
equatorial plane. We find that wind exists in both weakly and strongly
magnetized accretion flow. When magnetic field is weak (magnetic pressure is
more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than gas pressure), wind is driven by
gas pressure gradient and centrifugal forces. When magnetic field is strong
(magnetic pressure is slightly smaller than gas pressure), wind is driven by
gas pressure gradient and magnetic pressure gradient forces. The power of wind
in strongly magnetized case is just slightly larger than that in weakly
magnetized case. The power of wind lies in a range $ P_W \sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}

research mission at the interface of AI and economics [Conitzer and Sandholm,

the multi-dimensional settings fall short in at least one of the three aspects:
1) representation -- search in a space that probably does not even contain the
optimal mechanism; 2) exactness -- finding a mechanism that is either not
truthful or far from optimal; 3) domain dependence -- need a different design
for different environment settings.
  To resolve the three difficulties, in this paper, we put forward -- MenuNet
-- a unified neural network based framework that automatically learns to design
revenue optimal mechanisms. Our framework consists of a mechanism network that
takes an input distribution for training and outputs a mechanism, as well as a
buyer network that takes a mechanism as input and output an action. Such a
separation in design mitigates the difficulty to impose incentive compatibility
constraints on the mechanism, by making it a rational choice of the buyer. As a
result, our framework easily overcomes the previously mentioned difficulty in
incorporating IC constraints and always returns exactly incentive compatible
mechanisms.
  We then apply our framework to a number of multi-item revenue optimal design
settings, for a few of which the theoretically optimal mechanisms are unknown.
We then go on to theoretically prove that the mechanisms found by our framework
are indeed optimal.
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply neural networks to
discover optimal auction mechanisms with provable optimality.

the attention's output sequences of probability distribution, which is caused
by missing or superfluous characters, will confuse and mislead the training
process, and consequently make the training costly and degrade the recognition
accuracy. To handle this problem, we propose a novel method called edit

the probability of generating a string from the output sequence of probability
distribution conditioned on the input image, while considering the possible
occurrences of missing/superfluous characters. The advantage lies in that the
training process can focus on the missing, superfluous and unrecognized

results show that the EP can substantially boost scene text recognition

carbon nanotubes is to improve charge distribution at the electrocatalytic

during solvent evaporation. The diagnostic electrochemical experiments reveal
that at iridium-containing systems not only higher disk currents, but also much
smaller ring currents have been produced (compared to reduced graphene

shown how to achieve subquadratic BA under an {\it adaptive} adversary.
Intriguingly, they all make a common relaxation about the adaptivity of the
attacker, that is, if an honest node sends a message and then gets corrupted in
some round, the adversary {\it cannot erase the message that was already sent}
--- henceforth we say that such an adversary cannot perform ""after-the-fact

can tolerate after-the-fact removal. In this paper, we first prove that
disallowing after-the-fact removal is necessary for achieving
subquadratic-communication BA.
  Next, we show new subquadratic binary BA constructions (of course, assuming
no after-the-fact removal) that achieves near-optimal resilience and expected
constant rounds under standard cryptographic assumptions and a public-key
infrastructure (PKI) in both synchronous and partially synchronous settings. In
comparison, all known subquadratic protocols make additional strong assumptions
such as random oracles or the ability of honest nodes to erase secrets from

above properties. Lastly, we show that some setup assumption is necessary for

of reflectivity was always more than around 50% with no significant change in

pure sample completeness, since all cosmological point sources are selected
regardless of their intrinsic spectral properties within the limiting magnitude
of Gaia. We carry out a pilot-study by defining a sample compiled by including
all Gaia-DR2 sources within one degree of the North Galactic Pole (NGP)
selected to have proper motions consistent with zero within 2-sigma
uncertainty. By cross-matching the sample to the optical Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and the mid-infrared AllWISE photometric catalogues we
investigate the colours of each of our sources. Together with already
spectroscopically confirmed quasars we are therefore able to determine the
efficiency of our selection. The majority of the zero proper motion sources
have optical to mid-infrared colours consistent with known quasars. The
remaining population may be contaminating stellar sources, but some may also be
quasars with colours similar to stars. Spectroscopic follow-up of the zero
proper motion sources is needed to unveil such a hitherto hidden quasar
population. This approach has the potential to allow substantial progress on
many important questions concerning quasars such as determining the fraction of
dust-obscured quasars, the fraction of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, and
the metallicity distribution of damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. The technique
could also potentially reveal new types of quasars or even new classes of

single interaction events, such as clicks. In this paper, we for the first time
focus on modeling and predicting sequences of interaction events. And in
particular, sequences of clicks.
  We formulate the problem of click sequence prediction and propose a click
sequence model (CSM) that aims to predict the order in which a user will
interact with search engine results. CSM is based on a neural network that
follows the encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder computes contextual
embeddings of the results. The decoder predicts the sequence of positions of
the clicked results. It uses an attention mechanism to extract necessary
information about the results at each timestep. We optimize the parameters of
CSM by maximizing the likelihood of observed click sequences.
  We test the effectiveness of CSM on three new tasks: (i) predicting click
sequences, (ii) predicting the number of clicks, and (iii) predicting whether
or not a user will interact with the results in the order these results are
presented on a search engine result page (SERP). Also, we show that CSM
achieves state-of-the-art results on a standard click prediction task, where
the goal is to predict an unordered set of results a user will click on.

making tidal debris an unlikely explanation. In particular, 6 clouds identified
by the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey are interesting due to the combination
of their small size, isolation, and especially their broad line widths atypical
of other such clouds. A recent suggestion is that these clouds exist in
pressure equilibrium with the intracluster medium, with the line width arising
from turbulent internal motions. Here we explore that possibility by using the
FLASH code to perform a series of 3D hydro simulations. Our clouds are modelled
using spherical Gaussian density profiles, embedded in a hot, low-density gas
representing the intracluster medium. The simulations account for heating and
cooling of the gas, and we vary the structure and strength of their internal
motions. We create synthetic HI spectra, and find that none of our simulations
reproduce the observed cloud parameters for longer than about 100 Myr : the
clouds either collapse, disperse, or experience rapid heating which would cause
ionisation and render them undetectable to HI surveys. While the turbulent
motions required to explain the high line widths generate structures which
appear to be inherently unstable, making this an unlikely explanation for the
observed clouds, these simulations demonstrate the importance of including the
intracluster medium in any model seeking to explain the existence of these
objects.

radially excited heavy vector mesons are measured, while the corresponding
couplings for light vector mesons are not known. We propose a phenomenological
method allowing to estimate these unknown couplings. The method is suggested by
our observation that the electromagnetic coupling of the $n$-th radial
excitation of $S$-wave heavy vector meson decouples from the $e^+e^-$
annihilation with nearly exponential rate with $n$. It becomes natural to
assume that the same effect takes place in the light vector mesons and this
would allow to estimate the unknown couplings. We tested this assumption with
the help of a generalized version of borelized QCD spectral sum rules saturated
by a linear radial trajectory of meson states taken from the phenomenology.
This leads to a consistent setup which is able to predict the decoupling rate.
The calculated rate turned out to be almost the same as in the heavy vector
mesons. Our result may be interpreted as an effective account for non-trivial
electromagnetic formfactor in meson decays to $e^+e^-$, thus looking beyond the
large-$N_c$ limit. On the one hand, we argue that the given decoupling does not
necessary contradict to the previous large-$N_c$ results for the Regge like

smaller than the viscous diffusivity. The thermally-driven turbulent convection
in water is a typical example. In such a case the smallest scale in the problem
is the Batchelor scale $l_b$, rather than the Kolmogorov scale $l_k$, as $l_b =
l_k/Sc^{1/2}$, where Sc is the Schmidt number (or Prandtl number in the case of
temperature). In the numerical studies of such scalar turbulence, the
conventional approach is to use a single grid for both the velocity and scalar
fields. Such single-resolution scheme often over-resolves the velocity field
because the resolution requirement for scalar is higher than that for the
velocity field, since $l_b<l_k$ for $Sc>1$. In this paper we put forward an
algorithm that implements the so-called multiple-resolution method with a
finite-volume code. In this scheme, the velocity and pressure fields are solved
in a coarse grid, while the scalar field is solved in a dense grid. The central
idea is to implement the interpolation scheme on the framework of finite-volume
to reconstruct the divergence-free velocity from the coarse to the dense grid.
We demonstrate our method using a canonical model system of fluid turbulence,
the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. We show that, with the tailored mesh design,
considerable speed-up for simulating scalar turbulence can be achieved,
especially for large Schmidt (Prandtl) numbers. In the same time, sufficient
accuracy of the scalar and velocity fields can be achived by this
multiple-resolution scheme. Although our algorithm is demonstrated with a case
of an active scalar, it can be readily applied to passive scalar turbulent
flows.

  Quantification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern deep learning systems successfully solve many perception tasks such as
object pose estimation when the input image is of high quality. However, in
challenging imaging conditions such as on low-resolution images or when the
image is corrupted by imaging artifacts, current systems degrade considerably
in accuracy. While a loss in performance is unavoidable, we would like our
models to quantify their uncertainty in order to achieve robustness against
images of varying quality. Probabilistic deep learning models combine the
expressive power of deep learning with uncertainty quantification. In this
paper, we propose a novel probabilistic deep learning model for the task of
angular regression. Our model uses von Mises distributions to predict a
distribution over object pose angle. Whereas a single von Mises distribution is
making strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution, we extend the
basic model to predict a mixture of von Mises distributions. We show how to
learn a mixture model using a finite and infinite number of mixture components.
Our model allows for likelihood-based training and efficient inference at test
time. We demonstrate on a number of challenging pose estimation datasets that
our model produces calibrated probability predictions and competitive or
superior point estimates compared to the current state-of-the-art.

fashion along microtubules (MTs). It is generally accepted that steric
hindrance of motors leads to crowding effects; however, little is known about
the specific interactions involved. We employ an agent-based lattice gas model
to study the impact of interactions which enhance the detachment of motors from
crowded filaments on their collective dynamics. The predictions of our model
quantitatively agree with the experimentally observed concentration dependence
of key motor characteristics including their run length, dwell time, velocity,
and landing rate. From the anomalous stepping statistics of individual motors
which exhibit relatively long pauses we infer that kinesin-1 motors sometimes
lapse into an inactive state. Hereby, the formation of traffic jams amplifies
the impact of single inactive motors and leads to a crowding dependence of the
frequencies and durations of the resulting periods of no or slow motion. We
interpret these findings and conclude that kinesin-1 spends a significant
fraction of its stepping cycle in a weakly bound state in which only one of its
heads is bound to the MT.

Hamiltonian operator obtained by solving the RGPEP equations up to second order
in powers of the coupling constant. The eigenstate components that contain
three quarks and two or more gluons are heuristically removed at the price of
inserting a gluon-mass term in the component with one gluon. The resulting
problem is reduced to the equivalent one for the component of three quarks and
no gluons. Each of the three quark-quark interaction terms thus obtained
consists of a spin-dependent Coulomb term and a spin-independent harmonic
oscillator term. Quark masses are chosen to fit the lightest spin-one quarkonia
masses most accurately. The resulting estimates for bbb and ccc states match
estimates obtained in lattice QCD and in quark models. Masses of ccb and bbc

classification. Despite its high accuracies, CNN has been shown to be easily

for pattern classification. In this paper, we argue that the lack of robustness
for CNN is caused by the softmax layer, which is a totally discriminative model
and based on the assumption of closed world (i.e., with a fixed number of
categories). To improve the robustness, we propose a novel learning framework
called convolutional prototype learning (CPL). The advantage of using
prototypes is that it can well handle the open world recognition problem and
therefore improve the robustness. Under the framework of CPL, we design
multiple classification criteria to train the network. Moreover, a prototype
loss (PL) is proposed as a regularization to improve the intra-class
compactness of the feature representation, which can be viewed as a generative
model based on the Gaussian assumption of different classes. Experiments on
several datasets demonstrate that CPL can achieve comparable or even better
results than traditional CNN, and from the robustness perspective, CPL shows
great advantages for both the rejection and incremental category learning
tasks.

by social interaction and communication difficulties, along with narrow and
repetitive interests. Being an spectrum disorder, ASD affects individuals with
a large range of combinations of challenges along dimensions such intelligence,
social skills, or sensory processing. Hence, any computer-based technology for
ASD ought to be personalized to meet the particular profile and needs of each
person that uses it. Within the realm of Software Engineering, there is an
extensive body of research and practice on software customization whose
ultimate goal is meeting the diverse needs of software stakeholders in an
efficient and effective manner. These two facts beg the question: Can
computer-based technologies for autism benefit from this vast expertise in
software customization? As a first step towards answering this question, we
performed an exploratory study to evaluate current support for customization in
this type of technologies. Our study revealed that, even though its critical
importance, customization has not been addressed. We argue that this area is
ripe for research and application of software customization approaches such as
Software Product Lines.

software, but faces significant scalability challenges. There is a commonly
held belief that manual intervention by an expert can help alleviate these
limiting factors. However, there has been little formal investigation of this
idea. In this paper, we present our experiences applying the KLEE symbolic
execution engine to a new bug corpus, and of using manual intervention to
alleviate the issues encountered. Our contributions are (1) Hemiptera, a novel
corpus of over 130 bugs in real world software, (2) a comprehensive evaluation
of the KLEE symbolic execution engine on Hemiptera with a categorisation of
frequently occurring software patterns that are problematic for symbolic
execution, and (3) an evaluation of manual mitigations aimed at addressing the
underlying issues of symbolic execution. Our experience shows that manual
intervention can increase both code coverage and bug detection in many
situations. It is not a silver bullet however, and we discuss its limitations
and the challenges encountered.

2) A total of 338 plausible patches are generated on the QuixBugs by the
considered tools, and 53.3% of them are overfitting patches according to our

  We show that the (a Gorenstein type) symmetry of the zeta function combined

also find a multivariable polynomial generalization of the Seiberg-Witten

always perpendicular to their velocity and has an amplitude proportional to
1/r^2. The solar wind deflection is obtained at any point in space. The
resulting picture presents a caustic of intersecting trajectories, and a
circular region is found that is completely free of particles. The particles do
not lose any kinetic energy and this absence of deceleration, together with the
solar wind deflection pattern and the presence of a solar wind ion cavity, is
in good agreement with the general results of the Rosetta mission. The
qualitative match between the model and the in situ data highlights how
dominant the motional electric field is throughout most of the interaction
region for the solar wind proton dynamics. The model provides a simple general
kinetic description of how momentum is transferred between these two
collisionless plasmas. It also shows the potential of this semi-analytical
model for a systematic quantitative comparison to the data.

abundance that correlates with stellar mass for red giants between 2 and 3
Msun. This trend supports evolutionary mixing processes as the explanation for
Na overabundances seen in some red giants. In this same mass range, the surface
Al abundance was shown to be constant. Our main aim was to extend the
investigation of the Na and Al surface abundances to giants more massive than 3
Msun. We sought to establish accurately whether the Na abundances keep
increasing with stellar mass or a plateau is reached. In addition, we
investigated whether mixing can affect the surface abundance of Al in giants
more massive than 3 Msun. We obtained new high-resolution spectra of 20 giants
in the field of 10 open clusters; 17 of these stars were found to be members of
9 clusters. The giants have masses between 2.5 Msun and 5.6 Msun. Abundances of
C, N, and O were determined using spectrum synthesis. The abundances of Na and
Al were corrected for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects (non-LTE).
Moreover, to extend the mass range of our sample, we collected from the
literature high-quality C, N, O, and Na abundances of 32 Galactic Cepheids with
accurate masses in the range between 3 Msun and 14 Msun. The surface abundances
of C, N, O, Na, and Al were compared to predictions of stellar evolution models
with and without the inclusion of rotation-induced mixing. The surface
abundances of most giants and Cepheids of the sample can be explained by models
without rotation. For giants above ~ 2.5 Msun, the Na abundances reach a
plateau level of about [Na/Fe] ~ 0.20-0.25 dex (in non-LTE). Our results
support previous works that found models with rotation to overestimate the
mixing effects in intermediate-mass stars. [abridged]

flow and thermoelectric potential of electrolyte solutions in a

model developed by simultaneously solving the energy equation and the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes equations with the lubrication theory. The
semi-analytical model is shown to be mainly governed by eight parameters,
including two temperature-related parameters (temperature and its gradient),
two electrokinetic parameters ($\zeta$ potential and the ratio of capillary
radius to the Debye length $\kappa_0a$) and four physical properties of cation
and anion (i.e. Soret coefficient difference $\Delta S_T$, average Soret
coefficient $S_T$, normalized difference in diffusivities $\chi$ and intrinsic
Peclet number $\lambda$). It is found that the thermoelectric field is induced
by three effects, which are respectively due to (1) the difference in the Soret
coefficients of cation and anion; (2) the selective ion diffusion resulting
from the temperature-modified Boltzmann distribution of ions; (3) the advective
transport of ions caused by the fluid flow. The first thermoelectric effect
prevails for lower $\zeta$ potentials or large $\kappa_0a$, while the second is
dominant for higher $\zeta$ potentials with very small $\kappa_0a$. The first
two thermoelectric effects can cooperate or counteract depending on the sign of
$\zeta\Delta S_T$. Finally, the temperature-gradient-induced electrokinetic
flow is found to be a superposition of an electroosmotic flow component due to
the thermoelectric field and a thermoosmotic flow component due to the combined
effects of osmotic pressure and dielectric body force. These two flow
components may cooperate or counteract depending on values of $\zeta$ and
$\kappa_0a$.

are expen- sive to evaluate, lack an analytical expression and whose
evaluations can be contaminated by noise. These methods rely on a probabilistic
model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process (GP), upon which
an acquisition function is built. The acquisition function guides the
optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an
evaluation of the objective at a new point. GPs assume continous input
variables. When this is not the case, for example when some of the input
variables take categorical or integer values, one has to introduce extra
approximations. Consider a suggested input location taking values in the real
line. Before doing the evaluation of the objective, a common approach is to use
a one hot encoding approximation for categorical variables, or to round to the
closest integer, in the case of integer-valued variables. We show that this can
lead to problems in the optimization process and describe a more principled
approach to account for input variables that are categorical or integer-valued.
We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our
approach, which significantly improves the results of standard BO methods using
Gaussian processes on problems with categorical or integer-valued variables.

ground state wave functions are obtained at critical points for the

calculate classical and quantum correlations and mutual information. All of the

lattice distance for both the transition lines of the Ising universality class

correlations manifest the existence of diversing correlation lengths, which
means scale invariance. The critical features of the correlations can be
characterized by introducing a critical exponent of the power-law decaying
correlations. Similar to the critical exponent $\eta$ of the spin-spin
correlation for the universality classes in the transverse-field XY model, we
calculate the critical exponents of the two-spin classical and quantum

the correlations have the same critical exponents, i.e.,
$\eta^{I}=\eta^{C}=\eta^{D}$ at a critical point, where the superscripts $I$,

we do not find strong statistical support for deviations from the usual
modelling of the $L_{\rm X}-T$ relation as a single power-law, where the
normalisation evolves self-similarly and the scatter remains constant with
time. Nevertheless, assuming {\it a priori} the existence of the type of
deviations considered, then faster evolution than the self-similar expectation
for the normalisation of the $L_{\rm X}-T$ relation is favoured, as well as a
decrease with redshift in the scatter about the $L_{\rm X}-T$ relation.
Further, the preferred location for a change-point is then close to 2 keV,
possibly marking the transition between the group and cluster regimes. Our
results also indicate an increase in the power-law exponent of the $L_{\rm

evolution in the former with respect to the later, driving the
temperature-dependent change-point towards higher values with redshift.

initially unknown graph with $n$ vertices either by a single agent equipped
with a set of pebbles, or by a set of collaborating agents. The vertices of the
graph are unlabeled and cannot be distinguished by the agents, but the edges
incident to a vertex have locally distinct labels. The graph is explored when
all vertices have been visited by at least one agent. In this setting, it is
known that for a single agent without pebbles $\Theta(\log n)$ bits of memory
are necessary and sufficient to explore any graph with at most $n$ vertices. We
are interested in how the memory requirement decreases as the agent may mark
vertices by dropping and retrieving distinguishable pebbles, or when multiple
agents jointly explore the graph. We give tight results for both questions
showing that for a single agent with constant memory $\Theta(\log \log n)$
pebbles are necessary and sufficient for exploration. We further prove that the
same bound holds for the number of collaborating agents needed for exploration.
  For the upper bound, we devise an algorithm for a single agent with constant
memory that explores any $n$-vertex graph using $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$
pebbles, even when $n$ is unknown. The algorithm terminates after polynomial
time and returns to the starting vertex. Since an additional agent is at least
as powerful as a pebble, this implies that $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$ agents

show that the number of agents needed for exploring any graph of size $n$ is
already $\Omega(\log \log n)$ when we allow each agent to have at most
$\mathcal{O}( \log n ^{1-\varepsilon})$ bits of memory for any $\varepsilon>0$.
This also implies that a single agent with sublogarithmic memory needs
$\Theta(\log \log n)$ pebbles to explore any $n$-vertex graph.

two different strategies to thermostat the simulation box, since the low
symmetry of the flow field renders the control of temperature non trivial. We
show that both lead to an adequate control of the temperature of the system. To
deduce the hydrodynamic radius of the nanoparticle we have employed a partial
thermostat, which exploits the cylindrical symmetry of the flow field. Thereby,
only a part of the simulation box far from the nanoparticle is thermostated. We
have taken into account the finite concentration of the nanoparticle by using
the result of Hasimoto (J. Fluid. Mech. {\bf 1959}, {\it 5}, 317-328 ) for the
friction force in a periodic cubic array of spheres. We have focused on the
case of polyoxometalate ions, which are inorganic charged nanoparticles. It
appears that, for a given structure of the nanoparticle at the atomic level,
the hydrodynamic radius significantly increases with the nanoparticle's charge,
a phenomenon that had not been quantified so far using molecular dynamics. The
presence of an added salt only slightly modifies the hydrodynamic radius.

steady-state obtained after a variety of product-states initial conditions are
evolved unitarily, driven by the dynamics of quantum integrable models of the
rational (XXX) Richardson-Gaudin family, which includes notably Tavis-Cummings
models. The problem of interest here is one where a completely inhomogeneous
ensemble of two-level systems (spins-1/2) are coupled to a single bosonic mode.
  The long-time averaged magnetisation along the z-axis as well as the bosonic
occupation are evaluated in the diagonal ensemble by performing the complete
sum over the full Hilbert space for small system sizes. These numerically exact
results are independent of any particular choice of Hamiltonian and therefore
describe general results valid for any member of this class of quantum
integrable models built out of the same underlying conserved quantities.
  The collection of numerical results obtained can be qualitatively understood
by a relaxation process for which, at infinitely strong coupling, every initial
state will relax to a common state where each spin is in a maximally coherent
superposition of its $\left|\uparrow\right>$ and $\left|\downarrow\right>$
states, i.e. they are in-plane polarised, and consequently the bosonic mode is
also in a maximally coherent superposition of different occupation number
states. This bosonic coherence being a feature of a superradiant state, we
shall loosely use the term superradiant steady-state to describe it.
  A finite value of the coupling between the spins and the bosonic mode then
leads to a long-time limit steady-state whose properties are qualitatively
captured by a simple ""dynamical"" vision in which the coupling strength $V$
plays the role of a time $t_V$ at which this ""relaxation process"" towards the
common strong coupling superradiant steady-state is interrupted.

Action Unit (AU) localisation and intensity estimation. Contrary to previous
works that try to learn an unsupervised representation of the Action Unit
regions, we propose to directly and jointly estimate all AU intensities through
heatmap regression, along with the location in the face where they cause
visible changes. Our approach aims to learn a pixel-wise regression function
returning a score per AU, which indicates an AU intensity at a given spatial
location. Heatmap regression then generates an image, or channel, per AU, in
which each pixel indicates the corresponding AU intensity. To generate the
ground-truth heatmaps for a target AU, the facial landmarks are first
estimated, and a 2D Gaussian is drawn around the points where the AU is known
to cause changes. The amplitude and size of the Gaussian is determined by the
intensity of the AU. We show that using a single Hourglass network suffices to
attain new state of the art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of such a
simple approach. The use of heatmap regression allows learning of a shared
representation between AUs without the need to rely on latent representations,
as these are implicitly learned from the data. We validate the proposed
approach on the BP4D dataset, showing a modest improvement on recent, complex,
techniques, as well as robustness against misalignment errors. Code for testing

a sequence of edge insertions/deletions. We show how to maintain a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum vertex cover, ""deterministically"", in this
setting in $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ amortized update time.
  Prior to our work, the best known deterministic algorithm for maintaining a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum vertex cover was due to Bhattacharya,
Henzinger and Italiano [SODA 2015]. Their algorithm has an update time of
$O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$. Recently, Bhattacharya, Chakrabarty, Henzinger [IPCO
2017] and Gupta, Krishnaswamy, Kumar, Panigrahi [STOC 2017] showed how to
maintain an $O(1)$-approximation in $O(1)$-amortized update time for the same
problem. Our result gives an ""exponential"" improvement over the update time of
Bhattacharya et al. [SODA 2015], and nearly matches the performance of the
""randomized"" algorithm of Solomon [FOCS 2016] who gets an approximation ratio
of $2$ and an expected amortized update time of $O(1)$.
  We derive our result by analyzing, via a novel technique, a variant of the
algorithm by Bhattacharya et al. We consider an idealized setting where the
update time of an algorithm can take any arbitrary fractional value, and use
insights from this setting to come up with an appropriate potential function.
Conceptually, this framework mimics the idea of an LP-relaxation for an
optimization problem. The difference is that instead of relaxing an integral
objective function, we relax the update time of an algorithm itself. We believe
that this technique will find further applications in the analysis of dynamic
algorithms.

However, this approach comes with complications of interpretation. We review a
previously proposed alternative and more elegant approach, and then propose a
new approach based on hyperdifferential operator theory that we find most
satisfactory in terms of obtaining a self-consistent, pure, and elegant
definition of discrete scaling that is fully consistent with the theory of the

network structures. However, random walk based embedding methods have two
limitations. First, random walk methods are fragile when the sampling frequency
or the number of node sequences changes. Second, in disequilibrium networks
such as highly biases networks, random walk methods often perform poorly due to
the lack of global network information. In order to solve the limitations, we
propose in this paper a network diffusion based embedding method. To solve the
first limitation, our method employs a diffusion driven process to capture both
depth information and breadth information. The time dimension is also attached
to node sequences that can strengthen information preserving. To solve the
second limitation, our method uses the network inference technique based on
cascades to capture the global network information. To verify the performance,
we conduct experiments on node classification tasks using the learned
representations. Results show that compared with random walk based methods,
diffusion based models are more robust when samplings under each node is rare.
We also conduct experiments on a highly imbalanced network. Results shows that
the proposed model are more robust under the biased network structure.

neurons in the brain to cardiac cells to power grids to Josephson junction
arrays. Transitions to or out of synchrony for coupled oscillators depend on
several factors, such as individual frequencies, coupling, interaction time
delays and network structure-function relation. Here, using a generalized
Kuramoto model of time-delay coupled phase oscillators with frequency-weighted
coupling, we study the stability of incoherent and coherent states and the
transitions to or out of explosive (abrupt, first-order like) phase
synchronization. We analytically derive the exact formulas for the critical
coupling strengths at different time delays in both directions of increasing
(forward) and decreasing (backward) coupling strengths. We find that time-delay
does not affect the transition for the backward direction but shifts the
transition for the forward direction of increasing coupling strength. These
results provide valuable insights into our understanding of dynamical
mechanisms for explosive synchronization in presence of often unavoidable time

considerably along the MRCL, and hydrogenation continues like a mechanical

gamma-ray emission was not observed with the LAT until 30 and 32 days
post-periastron, respectively. The previous flares did not exhibit spectral
curvature, showed no short term variability, and did not exceed the pulsar
spin-down power. The high flux and short timescales observed in 2017 suggest
significant beaming of the emission is required and constrain the size of the
emission region. The flares occur long enough after periastron that the neutron
star should already have passed through the extended disk-like outflow, thus
constraining options for target material and seed photon sources for inverse
Compton models.

transient nature. In December 2016 we have witnessed such an event in NGC 3783.
The frequency and duration of these obscuration events is poorly known. Here we
study archival data of NGC 3783 in order to constrain this duty cycle. We use
archival Chandra/NuSTAR spectra taken in August 2016. We also study the
hardness ratio of all Swift XRT spectra taken between 2008-2017. In August
2016, NGC 3783 also showed evidence for obscuration. While the column density
of the obscuring material is ten times lower than in December 2016, the opacity
is still sufficient to block a significant fraction of the ionising X-ray and
EUV photons. From the Swift hardness ratio behaviour we find several other
epochs with obscuration. Obscuration with columns >1E26 per m2 may take place
in about half of the time. Also in archival X-ray data taken by ASCA in 1993

in NGC 3783 occurs more frequently than previously thought. This may not always
have been recognised due to low spectral resolution observations, too limited

an anonymous sensor network with n sensors and a single fusion center. The
fusion center collects the single observation from each of the n sensors to
detect a binary parameter. The sensors are clustered into multiple groups, and
different groups follow different distributions under a given hypothesis. The
key challenge for the fusion center is the anonymity of sensors - although it
knows the exact number of sensors and the distribution of observations in each
group, it does not know which group each sensor belongs to. It is hence natural
to consider it as a composite hypothesis testing problem. First, we propose an
optimal test called mixture likelihood ratio test based on the ratio of the
uniform mixture of all distributions under one hypothesis to that under the
other. Optimality is shown by first arguing that symmetric tests are optimal,
which do not depend on the order of observations across the sensors, and then
proving that the mixture likelihood ratio test is optimal among all symmetric
tests. Second, we focus on the Neyman-Pearson setting and characterize the
error exponent of the worst-case type-II error probability as n tends to
infinity, assuming the number of sensors in each group is proportional to n.
Finally, we generalize our result to find the collection of all achievable
type-I and type-II error exponents, where the boundary of the region can be
obtained by solving a convex program. Our results elucidate the price of
anonymity in heterogeneous distributed detection, and can be extended to M-ary
hypothesis testing with heterogeneous observations generated according to
hidden latent variables. The results are also applied to distributed detection
under Byzantine attacks, which hints that the conventional approach based on
simple hypothesis testing might be too pessimistic.

of the flux in the neighboring $1.54$ $\mu$m emission feature to the flux in

radioactive iron group elements in the central regions. Additionally, the

measuring line-width of this feature, the data show an increase in line width
not seen in the evolution of the synthetic spectra, corresponding to

to detonation producing asymmetric ionization in the ejecta. Using the

consequence the local commutativity is violated. Formulating such theories in

Euclidean interpretation. We will show how such non-local construction
ameliorates ultraviolet/short-distance singularities suffered typically in the

information about the driver's comfort zone in such conditions.Proxemics, or
human perception of space, has been largely explored when applied to humans or
to robots, leading to the concept of personal space, but poorly when applied to
vehicles. In this article, we highlight the existence and the characteristics
of a zone of comfort around the car which is not correlated to the risk of a
collision between the car and other road users. Our experiment includes 19
volunteers using a virtual reality headset to look at 30 scenarios filmed in
360{\textdegree} from the point of view of a passenger sitting in the driver's
seat of an autonomous car.They were asked to say ""stop"" when they felt
discomfort visualizing the scenarios.As said, the scenarios voluntarily avoid
collision effect as we do not want to measure fear but discomfort.The scenarios
involve one or three pedestrians walking past the car at different distances
from the wings of the car, relative to the direction of motion of the car, on
both sides. The car is either static or moving straight forward at different
speeds.The results indicate the existence of a comfort zone around the car in
which intrusion causes discomfort.The size of the comfort zone is sensitive
neither to the side of the car where the pedestrian passes nor to the number of
pedestrians. In contrast, the feeling of discomfort is relative to the car's
motion (static or moving).Another outcome from this study is an illustration of
the usage of first person 360{\textdegree} video and a virtual reality headset

Recently, Delyon et al. proved a new Bernstein-type concentration inequality

based on the fundamental inequalities for random permutations of Talagrand. The
idea is to first obtain a rough inequality for the square root of the permuted

that the understanding of the temporal evolution of asymmetric neural networks

high-resolution images by computationally transcending the diffraction blur of
an optical system. At the crux of this method is the phase retrieval algorithm,
which is used for computationally stitching together low-resolution images
taken under varying illumination angles of a coherent light source. However,
the traditional iterative phase retrieval technique relies heavily on the
initialization and also need a good amount of overlap in the Fourier domain for
the successively captured low-resolution images, thus increasing the
acquisition time and data. We show that an auto-encoder based architecture can
be adaptively trained for phase retrieval under both low overlap, where
traditional techniques completely fail, and at higher levels of overlap. For
the low overlap case we show that a supervised deep learning technique using an
autoencoder generator is a good choice for solving the Fourier ptychography
problem. And for the high overlap case, we show that optimizing the generator
for reducing the forward model error is an appropriate choice. Using
simulations for the challenging case of uncorrelated phase and amplitude, we
show that our method outperforms many of the previously proposed Fourier

atomically thin semiconductor with ultra-fast radiative decay rate inside a
\textcolor{black}{0D} cavity, it is possible to obtain narrow dark or bright
resonances in transmission whose width could be much smaller than that of the
cavity and bare exciton decay rates. While breaking of translational invariance
places a limit on the width of the dark resonance width, it is possible to
obtain a narrow bright resonance that is resilient against disorder by tuning
the cavity away from the excitonic transition. Resonant excitation of this
bright resonance yields strong photon antibunching even in the limit where the
interaction strength is arbitrarily smaller than the non-Markovian disorder

knowledge and educating our next generations. A good teacher will select
appropriate teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up
targeted examinations, according to the learning behaviors of the students. In
the field of artificial intelligence, however, one has not fully explored the
role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine \emph{learning}. In this
paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching,
and furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be
used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call this approach `learning to
teach'. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact with each other: a
student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning
algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss
function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student
model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to
optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as
to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of
our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an
example, and show that by using the learning to teach techniques, we are able
to use much less training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same
accuracy for different kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron,
convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) under various
machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification and text understanding).

attention since the application of Bayesian phylogenetic methods by Gray and
Atkinson(2003). The root age of the Indo-European family has tended to decrease
from an age that supported the Anatolian origin hypothesis to an age that
supports the Steppe origin hypothesis with the application of new models (Chang
et al., 2015). However, none of the published work in the Indo-European
phylogenetics studied the effect of tree priors on phylogenetic analyses of the
Indo-European family. In this paper, I intend to fill this gap by exploring the
effect of tree priors on different aspects of the Indo-European family's
phylogenetic inference. I apply three tree priors---Uniform, Fossilized
Birth-Death (FBD), and Coalescent---to five publicly available datasets of the
Indo-European language family. I evaluate the posterior distribution of the
trees from the Bayesian analysis using Bayes Factor, and find that there is
support for the Steppe origin hypothesis in the case of two tree priors. I
report the median and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of the root
ages for all the three tree priors. A model comparison suggested that either
Uniform prior or FBD prior is more suitable than the Coalescent prior to the
datasets belonging to the Indo-European language family.

hand-crafted features from the raw audio waveform, and learning a mapping

Recently, the focus of sound event detection research has been mostly shifted
to the latter stage using standard features such as mel spectrogram as the
input for classifiers such as deep neural networks. In this work, we utilize
end-to-end approach and propose to combine these two stages in a single deep
neural network classifier. The feature extraction over the raw waveform is
conducted by a feedforward layer block, whose parameters are initialized to
extract the time-frequency representations. The feature extraction parameters
are updated during training, resulting with a representation that is optimized
for the specific task. This feature extraction block is followed by (and
jointly trained with) a convolutional recurrent network, which has recently
given state-of-the-art results in many sound recognition tasks. The proposed
system does not outperform a convolutional recurrent network with fixed

feature extraction block parameters indicate that the most relevant information
for the given task is contained in 0 - 3 kHz frequency range, and this is also
supported by the empirical results on the SED performance.

latency continues to be a critical bottleneck for system performance. In this
work, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called ChargeCache, that enables faster
access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no modifications to DRAM chips.
Our mechanism is based on the key observation that a recently-accessed row has
more charge and thus the following access to the same row can be performed
faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to track the addresses of
recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory controller. If a later DRAM
request hits in that table, the memory controller uses lower timing parameters,
leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses are removed from the table after
a specified duration to ensure rows that have leaked too much charge are not
accessed with lower latency. We evaluate ChargeCache on a wide variety of
workloads and show that it provides significant performance and energy benefits
for both single-core and multi-core systems.

transmit signal designs compared to conventional wireless communications. In
this paper, the capacity of a discrete time, memoryless and complex Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel in the presence of a nonlinear energy
harvester at the receiver is studied. Considering the two common nonlinear
energy harvester models introduced in the literature, two sets of constraints
are considered. First the capacity is studied under average power (AP), peak
amplitude (PA) and receiver delivery power (RDP) constraints. The RDP
constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the
channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of
an AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the same as the capacity of an
AWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints,
it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that
under AP, PA and RDP constraints, the amplitude of the optimal inputs is
discrete with a finite number of mass points. Next, the capacity is studied
under AP, PA and output outage probability (OOP) constraints. OOP is modelled
as satisfying a certain probability inequality for the amplitude of the
received signal being outside of a given interval. Similarly, it is shown that
the amplitude of the optimal input is discrete with a finite number of mass
points.

propagation on unstructured meshes of quadrilaterals or hexahedra. A crucial
step towards efficiency is to evaluate operators in a matrix-free way with
sum-factorization kernels. The method allows for general curved geometries and
variable coefficients. Temporal discretization is carried out by low-storage
explicit Runge-Kutta schemes and the arbitrary derivative (ADER) method. For
ADER, we propose a flexible basis change approach that combines cheap face
integrals with cell evaluation using collocated nodes and quadrature points.
Additionally, a degree reduction for the optimized cell evaluation is presented
to decrease the computational cost when evaluating higher order spatial
derivatives as required in ADER time stepping. We analyze and compare the
performance of state-of-the-art Runge-Kutta schemes and ADER time stepping with
the proposed optimizations. ADER involves fewer operations and additionally
reaches higher throughput by higher arithmetic intensities and hence decreases
the required computational time significantly. Comparison of Runge-Kutta and
ADER at their respective CFL stability limit renders ADER especially beneficial
for higher orders when the Butcher barrier implies an overproportional amount
of stages. Moreover, vector updates in explicit Runge--Kutta schemes are shown
to take a substantial amount of the computational time due to their memory
intensity.

and an extremely successful long baseline neutrino programme, the third
generation Water Cherenkov detector, Hyper-Kamiokande, is being developed by an
international collaboration as a leading worldwide experiment based in Japan.
The Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be hosted in the Tochibora mine, about 295
km away from the J-PARC proton accelerator research complex in Tokai, Japan.
The currently existing accelerator will be steadily upgraded to reach a MW beam
by the start of the experiment. A suite of near detectors will be vital to
constrain the beam for neutrino oscillation measurements. A new cavern will be
excavated at the Tochibora mine to host the detector. The experiment will be
the largest underground water Cherenkov detector in the world and will be
instrumented with new technology photosensors, faster and with higher quantum
efficiency than the ones in Super-Kamiokande. The science that will be
developed will be able to shape the future theoretical framework and
generations of experiments. Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to measure with the
highest precision the leptonic CP violation that could explain the baryon
asymmetry in the Universe. The experiment also has a demonstrated excellent
capability to search for proton decay, providing a significant improvement in
discovery sensitivity over current searches for the proton lifetime. The
atmospheric neutrinos will allow to determine the neutrino mass ordering and,
together with the beam, able to precisely test the three-flavour neutrino
oscillation paradigm and search for new phenomena. A strong astrophysical
programme will be carried out at the experiment that will detect supernova
neutrinos and will measure precisely solar neutrino oscillation.

energy sources. DR schemes can be used to harness residential devices'
flexibility and to utilize it to achieve social and financial objectives.
However, existing DR schemes suffer from low user participation as they fail at
taking into account the users' requirements. First, DR schemes are highly
demanding for the users, as users need to provide direct information, e.g. via
surveys, on their energy consumption preferences. Second, the user utility
models based on these surveys are hard-coded and do not adapt over time. Third,
the existing scheduling techniques require the users to input their energy
requirements on a daily basis. As an alternative, this paper proposes a DR
scheme for user-oriented direct load-control of residential appliances
operations. Instead of relying on user surveys to evaluate the user utility, we
propose an online data-driven approach for estimating user utility functions,
purely based on available load consumption data, that adaptively models the
users' preference over time. Our scheme is based on a day-ahead scheduling
technique that transparently prescribes the users with optimal device operation
schedules that take into account both financial benefits and user-perceived
quality of service. To model day-ahead user energy demand and flexibility, we
propose a probabilistic approach for generating flexibility models under
uncertainty. Results on both real-world and simulated datasets show that our DR
scheme can provide significant financial benefits while preserving the
user-perceived quality of service.

However, speaker intentions are not readily available for use by automated

a turn-transition. To this end, we propose a multi-task neural approach for
predicting turn- transitions and speaker intentions simultaneously. Our results
show that adding the auxiliary task of speaker intention prediction improves
the performance of turn-transition prediction in spoken dialogues, without
relying on additional input features during run-time.

devices, like Xilinx with ARM-Cortex A cores, together with programmable logic
cells. These devices are known as Programmable System on Chip (PSoC). Their ARM
cores (embedded in the processing system or PS) communicates with the
programmable logic cells (PL) using ARM-standard AXI buses. In this paper we
analyses the performance of exhaustive data transfers between PS and PL for a
Xilinx Zynq FPGA in a co-design real scenario for Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) accelerator, which processes, in dedicated hardware, a stream of visual
information from a neuromorphic visual sensor for classification. In the PS
side, a Linux operating system is running, which recollects visual events from
the neuromorphic sensor into a normalized frame, and then it transfers these
frames to the accelerator of multi-layered CNNs, and read results, using an
AXI-DMA bus in a per-layer way. As these kind of accelerators try to process
information as quick as possible, data bandwidth becomes critical and
maintaining a good balanced data throughput rate requires some considerations.
We present and evaluate several data partitioning techniques to improve the
balance between RX and TX transfer and two different ways of transfers
management: through a polling routine at the userlevel of the OS, and through a
dedicated interrupt-based kernellevel driver. We demonstrate that for longer
enough packets, the kernel-level driver solution gets better timing in
computing a CNN classification example. Main advantage of using kernel-level
driver is to have safer solutions and to have tasks scheduling in the OS to
manage other important processes for our application, like frames collection
from sensors and their normalization.
