model-checking for temporal logics reduce to the solution of systems of
equations over suitable lattices. Inspired by recent work on lattice-theoretic
progress measures, we develop a game-theoretical approach to the solution of
systems of monotone equations over lattices, where for each single equation
either the least or greatest solution is taken. A simple parity game, referred
to as fixpoint game, is defined that provides a correct and complete
characterisation of the solution of equation systems over continuous lattices,
a quite general class of lattices widely used in semantics. For powerset
lattices the fixpoint game is intimately connected with classical parity games
for $\mu$-calculus model-checking, whose solution can exploit as a key tool
Jurdzi\'nski's small progress measures. We show how the notion of progress
measure can be naturally generalised to fixpoint games over continuous lattices
and we prove the existence of small progress measures. Our results lead to a
constructive formulation of progress measures as (least) fixpoints. We refine
this characterisation by introducing the notion of selection that allows one to
constrain the plays in the parity game, enabling an effective (and possibly
efficient) solution of the game, and thus of the associated verification
problem. We also propose a logic for specifying the moves of the existential
player that can be used to systematically derive simplified equations for
efficiently computing progress measures. We discuss potential applications to
the model-checking of latticed $\mu$-calculi and to the solution of fixpoint
equations systems over the reals.

cloud-scale star formation rates. Finally, studying diffuse emission can reveal
information about the physical processes taking place in the ISM, such as
chemical transitions and the nature of stellar feedback (through the photon
escape fraction). We present a physically-motivated method for decomposing
astronomical images containing both diffuse emission and compact regions of
interest, such as HII regions or molecular clouds, into diffuse and compact

presented a statistical method for constraining the evolutionary timeline of
star formation and mean separation length between compact star forming regions

biased by the presence of diffuse emission in tracer maps and that by using the
mean separation length as a critical length scale to separate diffuse emission
from compact emission, we are able to filter out this diffuse emission, thus
removing its biasing effect. Furthermore, this method provides, without the
need for interferometry or ancillary spectral data, a measurement of the
diffuse emission fraction in input tracer maps and decomposed diffuse and

literature as tools that address scalability issues of network intersection
control. Chief among these techniques are backpressure (BP) control algorithms,
which were originally developed of for large wireless networks. In addition to
being light-weight computationally, they come with guarantees of performance at
the network level, specifically network-wide stability. The dynamics in
backpressure control are represented using networks of point queues and this
also applies to all of the applications to traffic control. As such, BP in
traffic fail to capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along the
intersection links and, consequently, spill-back dynamics. This paper derives a
position weighted backpressure (PWBP) control policy for network traffic
applying continuum modeling principles of traffic dynamics and thus capture the
spatial distribution of vehicles along network roads and spill-back dynamics.
PWBP inherits the computational advantages of traditional BP. To prove
stability of PWBP, (i) a Lyapunov functional that captures the spatial
distribution of vehicles is developed; (ii) the capacity region of the network
is formally defined in the context of macroscopic network traffic; and (iii) it
is proved, when exogenous arrival rates are within the capacity region, that
PWBP control is network stabilizing. We conduct comparisons against a
real-world adaptive control implementation for an isolated intersection.
Comparisons are also performed against other BP approaches in addition to
optimized fixed timing control at the network level. These experiments
demonstrate the superiority of PWBP over the other control policies in terms of
capacity region, network-wide delay, congestion propagation speed,
recoverability from heavy congestion (outside of the capacity region), and
response to incidents.

formamide (NH$_2$CHO). In addition we searched for other iCOMs and ketene
(H$_2$CCO), formic acid (HCOOH) and methoxy (CH$_3$O), whose only ketene was

cover a large upper level energy range, between 15 and 254 K. This allowed us
to carry out a rotational diagram analysis and derive rotational temperatures
between 35 and 110 K, and column densities between $3\times 10^{15}$ and

that (i) SVS13-A is as chemically rich as younger Class 0 protostars, and (ii)

the natural model for these dense substructures is often a complete bipartite

the time per MIB depends on the number of edges in the graph. In this work, we
present a new algorithm for enumerating MIBs in general graphs, whose run time

parameterized by the size k of an odd cycle transversal (OCT), a vertex set
whose deletion results in a bipartite graph. Our algorithm runs in time O(M

  Quenching",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optogenetics is a revolutionary new field of biotechnology, achieving optical
control over biological functions in living cells by genetically inserting
light sensitive proteins into cellular signaling pathways. Applications of
optogenetic switches are expanding rapidly, but the technique is hampered by
spectral cross-talk: the broad absorption spectra of compatible biochemical
chromophores limits the number of switches that can be independently controlled
and restricts the dynamic range of each switch. In the present work we develop
and implement a non-linear optical photoswitching capability, Stimulated
Depletion Quenching (SDQ), is used to overcome spectral cross-talk by
exploiting the molecules' unique dynamic response to ultrashort laser pulses.
SDQ is employed to enhance the control of Cph8, a photo-reversible phytochrome
based optogenetic switch designed to control gene expression in E. Coli
bacteria. The Cph8 switch can not be fully converted to it's biologically
inactive state ($P_{FR}$) by linear photos-witching, as spectral cross-talk
causes a reverse photoswitching reaction to revert to it back to the active
state ($P_{R}$). SDQ selectively halts this reverse reaction while allowing the
forward reaction to proceed. The results of this proof of concept experiment
lay the foundation for future experiments that will use optimal pulse shaping
to further enhance control of Cph8 and enable simultaneous, multiplexed control
of multiple optogenetic switches.

Assuming this to be the case, we entertain the possibility that the underlying
new physics also affects the rare nonleptonic decays of the $\bar B_s^0$ meson.
We consider in particular new physics arising from the interactions of a heavy
$Z'$ boson and investigate their influence on the decay modes $\bar
B_s^0\to(\eta,\eta',\phi)\omega$, which receive sizable QCD- and
electroweak-penguin contributions. These decays are not yet observed, and their
rates are estimated to be relatively small in the SM. Taking into account the
pertinent constraints, we find that the $Z'$ effects can greatly increase the
rates of $\bar B_s^0\to(\eta,\phi)\omega$, by as much as two orders of
magnitude, with respect to the SM expectations. We have previously shown that
$\bar B_s^0\to(\eta,\phi)\pi^0$, with similarly suppressed SM rates, could also
undergo substantial $Z'$-induced enhancement. These rare modes can therefore
serve as complementary probes of the potential new physics which may be
responsible for the $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ anomalies.

packet when it is heard on the channel. Each station manages when it is
switched on and off by way of a programmable wakeup mechanism, which is
scheduled by a routing algorithm. Packet injection is governed by adversarial

develop deterministic distributed routing algorithms and assess their
performance in the worst-case sense. One of the algorithms maintains bounded
queues for the maximum injection rate 1 subject only to the energy cap 3. This
energy cap is provably optimal, in that obtaining the same throughput with the

correlations in the Anderson model on random regular graphs (RRG) are studied.
We consider the critical point of the Anderson transition and the delocalized
phase. In the delocalized phase near the transition point, the observables show
a broad critical regime for system sizes $N$ below the correlation volume
$N_{\xi}$ and then cross over to the ergodic behavior. Eigenstate correlations
allow us to visualize the correlation length $\xi \sim \log N_{\xi}$ that
controls the finite-size scaling near the transition. The critical-to-ergodic
crossover is very peculiar, since the critical point is similar to the
localized phase, whereas the ergodic regime is characterized by very fast
""diffusion"" which is similar to the ballistic transport. In particular, the
return probability crosses over from a logarithmically slow variation with time
in the critical regime to an exponentially fast decay in the ergodic regime.
Spectral correlations in the delocalized phase near the transition are
characterized by level number variance $\Sigma_2(\omega)$ crossing over, with
increasing freqyency $\omega$, from ergodic behavior
$\Sigma_2=\left(2/\pi^2\right)\ln\omega/\Delta$ to $\Sigma_2\propto \omega^2$
at $\omega_c\sim (N N_{\xi})^{-1/2}$ and finally to Poissonian behavior
$\Sigma_2 = \omega/\Delta$ at $\omega_{\xi}\sim N_{\xi}^{-1}$. We find a
perfect agreement between results of exact diagonalization and those resulting
from the solution of the self-consistency equation obtained within the
saddle-point analysis of the effective supersymmetric action. We show that the
RRG model can be viewed as an intricate $d\to\infty$ limit of the Anderson
model in $d$ spatial dimensions.

and Br$\gamma$ along interfaces between HII regions and PDRs. Br$\gamma$ traces
photoevaporative flows from the PDRs, and this emission declines more rapidly
with distance as the radius of curvature of the interface decreases, in
agreement with models. As noted previously, H$_2$ emission peaks deeper into
the cloud relative to Br$\gamma$, where the molecular gas absorbs far-UV
radiation from nearby O-stars. Although PDRs in IC 1396, Cygnus OB2, and Carina
experience orders of magnitude different levels of ionizing flux and have
markedly differing geometries, all the PDRs have spatial offsets between
Br$\gamma$ and H$_2$ on the order of $10^{17}$cm. There is a weak negative
correlation between the offset size and the intensity of ionizing radiation and
a positive correlation with the radius of curvature of the cloud. We can
reproduce both the size of the offsets and the dependencies of the offsets on
these other variables with simple photoevaporative flow models. Both Br$\gamma$

searches based on signals that could not individually be established as
discoveries. The rapid identification of signals is important in order to
initiate timely follow-up observations of transient emission that is only
detectable for short time periods. Joint searches for gravitational waves and
high-energy neutrinos represent a prime motivation for this strategy. Both
gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos are typically emitted over a
short time frame of seconds to minutes during the formation or evolution of
compact objects. In addition, detectors searching for both messengers observe
the whole sky continuously, making observational information on potential
transient sources rapidly available to guide follow-up electromagnetic surveys.
The direction of high-energy neutrinos can be reconstructed to sub-degree
precision, making a joint detection much better localized than a typical
gravitational wave signal. Here we present a search strategy for joint
gravitational wave and high-energy neutrino events that allows the
incorporation of astrophysical priors and detector characteristics following a
Bayesian approach. We aim to determine whether a multi-messenger correlated
signal is a real event, a chance coincidence of two background events or the
chance coincidence of an astrophysical signal and a background event. We use an
astrophysical prior that is model agnostic and takes into account mostly
geometric factors. Our detector characterization in the search is mainly
empirical, enabling detailed realistic accounting for the sensitivity of the
detector that can depend on the source properties. By this means, we will
calculate the false alarm rate for each multi-messenger event which is required

or axion-like particle. A collection of axions can condense into a bound
Bose-Einstein condensate called an axion star. It is possible that a
significant fraction of the axion dark matter is in the form of axion stars.
This would make some efforts to identify the axion as the dark matter particle
more challenging, but it would also open up new possibilities. We summarize the
basic properties of isolated axion stars, which can be gravitationally bound or
bound by self-interactions. Axions are naturally described by a relativistic
field theory with a real scalar field, but low-energy axions can be described
more simply by a classical nonrelativistic effective field theory with a

problem in real chaos-based communication. Especially, in multi-scroll Chua's
circuit, the simplified implementation of piecewise-linear resistors with
multiple segments is difficult due to their intricate irregular breakpoints and
slopes. To solve the challenge, this paper presents a systematic scheme for
synthesizing a Chua's diode with multi-segment piecewise-linearity, which is
achieved by cascading even-numbered passive nonlinear resistors with
odd-numbered ones via a negative impedance converter. The traditional voltage
mode op-amps are used to implement nonlinear resistors. As no extra DC bias
voltage is employed, the scheme can be implemented by much simpler circuits.
The voltage-current characteristics of the obtained Chua's diode are analyzed
theoretically and verified by numerical simulations. Using the Chua's diode and
a second-order active Sallen-Key high-pass filter, a new inductor-free Chua's
circuit is then constructed to generate multi-scroll chaotic attractors.
Different number of scrolls can be generated by changing the number of passive
nonlinear resistor cells or adjusting two coupling parameters. Besides, the
system can be scaled by using different power supplies, satisfying the
low-voltage low-power requirement of integrated circuit design. The circuit
simulations and hardware experiments both confirmed the feasibility of the
designed system.

MDP planning domains expressed in an RDDL representation. Our architecture
exploits the symbolic state configuration and transition function of the domain
(available via RDDL) to learn a shared embedding space for states and
state-action pairs for all problem instances of a domain. We then learn an RL
agent in the embedding space, making a near zero-shot transfer possible, i.e.,
without much training on the new instance, and without using the domain
simulator at all. Experiments on three different benchmark domains underscore
the value of our transfer algorithm. Compared against planning from scratch,

astronomy. While exoplanetary aurorae are predicted to be bright at low radio
frequencies (< 1 GHz), we consider the effect of an exoplanet transit on radio
emission from the host star. As radio emission from solar-like stars is
concentrated in active regions, a planet occulting a starspot can cause a
disproportionately deep transit which should be detectable with major radio
arrays currently under development, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
We calculate the radiometric sensitivity of the SKA stages and components,
finding that SKA2-Mid can expect to detect transits around the very nearest
solar-like stars and many cool dwarfs. The shape of this radiometric light
curve will be affected by scintillation and lensing from the planet's
magnetosphere and thereby encode magnetospheric parameters. Furthermore, these
transits will also probe the distribution of stellar activity across a star's
surface, and will help scrub out contamination from stellar activity on
exoplanet transmission spectra and radial velocity spectra. This radio window
on exoplanets and their host stars is therefore a valuable complement to
existing optical tools.

computing eigenvalues and invariant subspaces of structured generalized and
polynomial eigenvalue problems (PEPs). These transformations convert problems
with certain structures arising in applications into problems with other
structures and whose eigenvalues and invariant subspaces are easily related to
the ones of the original problem. Thus, an algorithm that is efficient and
stable for some particular structure can be used for solving efficiently
another type of structured problem via an adequate M\""{o}bius transformation. A
key question in this context is whether these transformations may change
significantly the conditioning of the problem and the backward errors of the
computed solutions, since, in that case, their use may lead to unreliable
results. We present the first general study on the effect of M\""{o}bius
transformations on the eigenvalue condition numbers and backward errors of
approximate eigenpairs of PEPs. By using the homogeneous formulation of PEPs,
we are able to obtain two clear and simple results. First, we show that, if the
matrix inducing the M\""{o}bius transformation is well conditioned, then such
transformation approximately preserves the eigenvalue condition numbers and
backward errors when they are defined with respect to perturbations of the
matrix polynomial which are small relative to the norm of the polynomial.
However, if the perturbations in each coefficient of the matrix polynomial are
small relative to the norm of that coefficient, then the corresponding
eigenvalue condition numbers and backward errors are preserved approximately by
the M\""{o}bius transformations induced by well-conditioned matrices only if a
penalty factor, depending on those coefficients, is moderate. It is important
to note that these simple results are no longer true if a non-homogeneous
formulation is used.

numerical simulations are necessary to make advances in our understanding of
this rich physics. Because simulations can capture both the linear and
nonlinear evolution of perturbations with a relatively wide range of sizes, it
is important to thoroughly understand the stability of condensation and
acoustic modes between the two extreme wavelength limits of isobaric and
isochoric instability as identified by Field (1965). Partially motivated by a
recent suggestion that large non-isobaric clouds can `shatter' into tiny
cloudlets, we revisit the linear theory to survey all possible regimes of
thermal instability. We uncover seven regimes in total, one of which allows
three unstable condensation modes. Using the code Athena++, we determine the
numerical requirements to properly evolve small amplitude perturbations of the
entropy mode into the nonlinear regime. Our 1D numerical simulations
demonstrate that for a typical AGN cooling function, the nonlinear evolution of
a single eigenmode in an isobarically unstable plasma involves increasingly
larger amplitude oscillations in cloud size, temperature and density as the
wavelength increases. Such oscillations are the hallmark behavior of
non-isobaric multiphase gas dynamics and may be observable as correlations
between changes in brightness and the associated periodic redshifts and
blueshifts in systems that can be spatially resolved. Intriguingly, we discuss
regimes and derive characteristic cloud sizes for which the saturation process
giving rise to these oscillations can be so energetic that the cloud may indeed
break apart. However, we dub this process `splattering' instead of
`shattering', as it is a different fragmentation mechanism triggered when the
cloud suddenly `lands' on the stable cold branch of the equilibrium curve.

luminosity of (~2x10^{47} erg/s) min({\rho}^2, B{\rho}^{4/3}{\nu}^{-2/3}),
where {\rho} is the curvature radius of the magnetic field lines near the
source region in units of 10 km, B is the local magnetic field strength in

is because the electric field responsible for accelerating the radiating

quickly shielded by Schwinger pairs within a nano-second. Future observations
should be able to confirm this cut-off luminosity and hence provide a unique
probe of the source location and magnetic field strength. We discuss how the

g-mode pulsations, comprising the class of pulsating WDs called extremely
low-mass variable (ELMV) stars. It is generally believed that these stars have
thick H envelopes. However, from stellar evolution considerations, the
existence of LMWDs with thin H envelopes is also possible. We present a
thorough asteroseismological analysis of ELMV stars based on a complete set of
fully evolutionary models that represents low-mass He-core WD stars harboring a
range of H envelope thicknesses. Although there are currently nine ELMVs, here
we only focus on those that exhibit more than three periods and whose periods
do not show significant uncertainties. We considered g-mode adiabatic pulsation
periods for low-mass He-core WD models with $M_*$ in the range
[0.1554-0.4352]$M_{\odot}$, $T_{\rm eff}$ in the range [6000-10000]K, and H
envelope thicknesses in the range -5.8<log($M_{\rm H}/M_*$)<-1.7. We explore
the effects of employing different H-envelope thicknesses on the adiabatic
pulsation properties of low-mass He-core WD models, and perform
period-to-period fits to ELMVs to search for a representative model. We found
that the mode-trapping effects of g modes depend sensitively on $M_{\rm H}$,
with the trapping cycle and trapping amplitude larger for thinner H envelopes.
Also, the asymptotic period spacing is longer for thinner H envelopes. Finally,
we found asteroseismological models (when possible) characterized by canonical
(thick) and by thin H envelope, with $T_{\rm eff}$ and $M_*$ in agreement with
the spectroscopic determinations. The fact that we have found
asteroseismological solutions with H envelopes thinner than canonical gives a
clue of the possible scenario of formation of these stars. Indeed, in the light
of our results, some of these stars could have been formed by binary evolution
through unstable mass loss.

technologies are the absence of error correction and the short coherence time,
which limit the computational power of these systems. Shortening the required
time of a single run of a quantum algorithm is essential for reducing
environment-induced errors and for the efficiency of the computation. We have
investigated the ability of a variational version of adiabatic quantum
computation (AQC) to generate an accurate state more efficiently compared to
existing adiabatic methods. The standard AQC method uses a time-dependent
Hamiltonian, connecting the initial Hamiltonian with the final Hamiltonian. In
the current approach, a navigator Hamiltonian is introduced which has a
non-zero amplitude only in the middle of the annealing process. Both the
initial and navigator Hamiltonians are determined using variational methods. A
hermitian cluster operator, inspired by coupled-cluster theory and truncated to
single and double excitations/de-excitations, is used as a navigator
Hamiltonian. A comparative study of our variational algorithm (VanQver) with
that of standard AQC, starting with a Hartree--Fock Hamiltonian, is presented.
The results indicate that the introduction of the navigator Hamiltonian
significantly improves the annealing time required to achieve chemical accuracy
by two to three orders of magnitude. The efficiency of the method is
demonstrated in the ground-state energy estimation of molecular systems,
namely, H$_2$, P4, and LiH.

traditional von Neumann processors, however programming these brain-inspired
platforms generally requires platform-specific expertise which limits their
applicability. To date, the majority of artificial neural networks have not

  We present a method for training deep spiking neural networks using an
iterative modification of the backpropagation optimization algorithm. This
method, which we call Whetstone, effectively and reliably configures a network
for a spiking hardware target with little, if any, loss in performance.
Whetstone networks use single time step binary communication and do not require
a rate code or other spike-based coding scheme, thus producing networks
comparable in timing and size to conventional ANNs, albeit with binarized
communication. We demonstrate Whetstone on a number of image classification
networks, describing how the sharpening process interacts with different
training optimizers and changes the distribution of activity within the
network. We further note that Whetstone is compatible with several
non-classification neural network applications, such as autoencoders and
semantic segmentation. Whetstone is widely extendable and currently implemented

migration is induced by the ionization of valence molecular orbitals. However,

synthesis can be used to efficiently synthesize a simple class of

  We extend this synthesis algorithm to a broader class of lenses, called
simple symmetric lenses, including all bijective lenses, all of the popular

proposed by Hofmann et al. Intuitively, simple symmetric lenses allow some
information to be present on one side but not the other and vice versa. They
are of independent theoretical interest, being the largest class of symmetric
lenses that do not use persistent internal state.
  Synthesizing simple symmetric lenses is more challenging than synthesizing
bijective lenses: Since some of the information on each side can be
""disconnected"" from the other side, there will typically be many lenses that
agree with a given example. To guide the search process, we use stochastic
regular expressions and information theory to estimate the amount of
information propagated by a candidate lens, preferring lenses that propagate
more information, as well as user annotations marking parts of the source and
target formats as either irrelevant or essential.
  We describe an implementation of simple symmetric lenses and our synthesis
procedure as extensions to the Boomerang language. We evaluate its performance
on 48 benchmark examples drawn from Flash Fill, Augeas, and the bidirectional

  Algorithms",,,,,"cs.NE math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the empirical study of evolutionary algorithms, the solution quality is
evaluated by either the fitness value or approximation error. The latter
measures the fitness difference between an approximation solution and the
optimal solution. Since the approximation error analysis is more convenient
than the direct estimation of the fitness value, this paper focuses on
approximation error analysis. However, it is straightforward to extend all
related results from the approximation error to the fitness value. Although the
evaluation of solution quality plays an essential role in practice, few
rigorous analyses have been conducted on this topic. This paper aims at
establishing a novel theoretical framework of approximation error analysis of
evolutionary algorithms for discrete optimization. This framework is divided
into two parts. The first part is about exact expressions of the approximation
error. Two methods, Jordan form and Schur's triangularization, are presented to
obtain an exact expression. The second part is about upper bounds on
approximation error. Two methods, convergence rate and auxiliary matrix
iteration, are proposed to estimate the upper bound. The applicability of this
framework is demonstrated through several examples.

Universe, where black hole (BH) growth is sustained by an enhanced number of
mergers and by being at the intersection of filaments bringing fresh gas. This
assumption should be supported by an enhancement of the number counts of
galaxies in the field of view of quasars. While the current observations of
quasar environments do not lead to a consensus on a possible excess of
galaxies, the future missions JWST, WFIRST, and Euclid will provide new
insights on quasar environments, and will substantially increase the number of
study-cases. We are in a crucial period, where we need to both understand the
current observations and predict how upcoming missions will improve our
understanding of BH environments. Using the large-scale simulation Horizon-AGN,
we find that statistically the most massive BHs reside in environments with the
largest number counts of galaxies. However, we find a large variance in galaxy
number counts, and some massive BHs do not show enhanced counts in their
neighborhood. Interestingly, some massive BHs have a very close galaxy
companion but no further enhancement of the galaxy number counts at larger
scales, in agreement with recent observations. We find that AGN feedback in the
surrounding galaxies is able to decrease their luminosity and stellar mass, and
therefore to make them un-observable when using restrictive galaxy selection
criteria. Radiation from the quasars can spread over large distances, which
could affect the formation history of surrounding galaxies, but a careful
analysis of these processes requires radiative transfer simulations.

are useful tracers of the coevolution of galaxies and their supermassive black
holes, as driven by AGN feedback and AGN fueling. We investigate this concept
further with follow-up optical longslit observations of a sample of 95 Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies that have double-peaked narrow AGN emission
lines. Based on a kinematic analysis of the longslit spectra, we confirm
previous work that finds that the majority of double-peaked narrow AGN emission
lines are associated with outflows. We also find that eight of the galaxies
have companion galaxies with line-of-sight velocity separations < 500 km/s and
physical separations <30 kpc. Since we find evidence of AGNs in both galaxies,
all eight of these systems are compelling dual AGN candidates. Galaxies with
double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines occur in such galaxy mergers at least
twice as often as typical active galaxies. Finally, we conclude that at least
3% of SDSS galaxies with double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines are found in
galaxy mergers where both galaxies are resolved in SDSS imaging.

However, in many real-world settings one seeks to adapt to multiple, but
somewhat similar, target domains. Applying pairwise adaptation approaches to
this setting may be suboptimal, as they fail to leverage shared information
among multiple domains. In this work we propose an information theoretic
approach for domain adaptation in the novel context of multiple target domains
with unlabeled instances and one source domain with labeled instances. Our
model aims to find a shared latent space common to all domains, while
simultaneously accounting for the remaining private, domain-specific factors.
Disentanglement of shared and private information is accomplished using a
unified information-theoretic approach, which also serves to establish a
stronger link between the latent representations and the observed data. The
resulting model, accompanied by an efficient optimization algorithm, allows
simultaneous adaptation from a single source to multiple target domains. We
test our approach on three challenging publicly-available datasets, showing

excitations emerging in topological metal bands, dubbed double-triple-point
(DTP) fermions. We first present a general three-band continuum model with
$C_4$ symmetry in three dimensions, which has three types of threefold
degenerate points in the bands classified by their topological charges
$C=\pm4,\pm2,0$, respectively. They are dubbed DTPs as spin-1 generalization of
double-Weyl points. We then construct two-dimensional and three-dimensional
tight-binding lattice models of topological metal bands with exotic DTP
fermions near the DTPs. In two dimensions, the band gaps close at a trivial DTP
with zero Berry phase, which occurs at the transition between the normal and
topological insulator phases. In three dimensions, the topological properties
of three different DTP fermions in lattice systems are further investigated,
and the effects of breaking $C_4$ symmetry are also studied, which generally
leads to splitting each quadratic DTP into two linear triple points and gives
topological phase diagrams. Using ultracold fermionic atoms in optical
lattices, the proposed models can be realized and the topological properties of
the DTP fermions can be detected.

  pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV physics.data-an stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dimensionality-reduction methods are a fundamental tool in the analysis of
large data sets. These algorithms work on the assumption that the ""intrinsic
dimension"" of the data is generally much smaller than the ambient dimension in
which it is collected. Alongside their usual purpose of mapping data into a
smaller dimension with minimal information loss, dimensionality-reduction
techniques implicitly or explicitly provide information about the dimension of
the data set.
  In this paper, we propose a new statistic that we call the $\kappa$-profile
for analysis of large data sets. The $\kappa$-profile arises from a
dimensionality-reduction optimization problem: namely that of finding a
projection into $k$-dimensions that optimally preserves the secants between
points in the data set. From this optimal projection we extract $\kappa,$ the
norm of the shortest projected secant from among the set of all normalized
secants. This $\kappa$ can be computed for any $k$; thus the tuple of $\kappa$
values (indexed by dimension) becomes a $\kappa$-profile. Algorithms such as
the Secant-Avoidance Projection algorithm and the Hierarchical Secant-Avoidance
Projection algorithm, provide a computationally feasible means of estimating
the $\kappa$-profile for large data sets, and thus a method of understanding
and monitoring their behavior. As we demonstrate in this paper, the
$\kappa$-profile serves as a useful statistic in several representative
settings: weather data, soundscape data, and dynamical systems data.

tracer particle motion is complicated by influences from the normal fluid,

introduced a scheme for differentiating particles trapped on vortices (G1) from
particles entrained by the normal fluid (G2). In this paper, we apply this
scheme to demonstrate the utility of PTV for quantitative measurements of
vortex dynamics in He II counterflow. We estimate $\ell$, the mean vortex line
spacing, using G2 velocity data, and $c_2$, a parameter related to the mean
curvature radius of vortices and energy dissipation in quantum turbulence,
using G1 velocity data. We find that both estimations show good agreement with
existing measurements that were obtained using traditional experimental
methods. This is of particular consequence since these parameters likely vary
in space, and PTV offers the advantage of spatial resolution. We also show a
direct link between power-law tails in transverse particle velocity probability
density functions (PDFs) and reconnection of vortex lines on which G1 particles

bounded away from zero in its support. In practice, however, KSG estimator also
performs well for a much broader class of distributions, including not only
those with bounded support and densities bounded away from zero, but also those
with bounded support but densities approaching zero, and those with unbounded
support. In this paper, we analyze the convergence rate of the error of KSG
estimator for smooth distributions, whose support of density can be both
bounded and unbounded. As KSG mutual information estimator can be viewed as an
adaptive recombination of KL entropy estimators, in our analysis, we also
provide convergence analysis of KL entropy estimator for a broad class of

Recent research has demonstrated the widespread presence and the devastating

their underlying assumptions. We argue that adversarial sample attacks are
deeply entangled with interpretability of DNN models: while classification
results on benign inputs can be reasoned based on the human perceptible
features/attributes, results on adversarial samples can hardly be explained.
Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial sample detection technique for face
recognition models, based on interpretability. It features a novel
bi-directional correspondence inference between attributes and internal neurons
to identify neurons critical for individual attributes. The activation values
of critical neurons are enhanced to amplify the reasoning part of the
computation and the values of other neurons are weakened to suppress the
uninterpretable part. The classification results after such transformation are
compared with those of the original model to detect adversaries. Results show
that our technique can achieve 94% detection accuracy for 7 different kinds of
attacks with 9.91% false positives on benign inputs. In contrast, a
state-of-the-art feature squeezing technique can only achieve 55% accuracy with
23.3% false positives.

the annual mean wave spectrum. Significant seasonal cycling, long-term trends,
and correlations with climate indices are observed in the local wave spectra,
showing the abundant climatic information they contain. The projections of the
wind vector on the direction pointing to the target location are used to link
the spectral wave climate and basin-scale wind climate. The origins of all the

interactions beyond the Standard Model involving new states, such as
leptoquarks. Since the processes involved are quark flavor changing, any new
states would need to couple to at least two different generations of quarks,
requiring a non-trivial flavor structure in the quark sector while avoiding
stringent constraints from flavor-changing neutral current processes. In this

consider constraints on their parameter space from self-consistency of the MFV

$h(S+Z)$, where $S$ and $Z$ are independent $d$-dimensional random variables
with $Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 \mathrm{I}_d)$. The distribution of $S$ is
unknown, but $n$ independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples from
it are available. The question is whether having access to samples of $S$ as
opposed to samples of $S+Z$ can improve estimation performance. We show that
the answer is positive. More concretely, we first show that despite the
regularizing effect of noise, the number of required samples still needs to
scale exponentially in $d$. This result is proven via a random-coding argument
that reduces the question to estimating the Shannon entropy on a
$2^{O(d)}$-sized alphabet. Next, for a fixed $d$ and $n$ large enough, it is
shown that a simple plugin estimator, given by the differential entropy of the
empirical distribution from $S$ convolved with the Gaussian density, achieves
the loss of $O\left((\log n)^{d/4}/\sqrt{n}\right)$. Note that the plugin
estimator amounts here to the differential entropy of a $d$-dimensional
Gaussian mixture, for which we propose an efficient Monte Carlo computation
algorithm. At the same time, estimating $h(S+Z)$ via popular differential
entropy estimators (based on kernel density estimation (KDE) or k nearest
neighbors (kNN) techniques) applied to samples from $S+Z$ would only attain
much slower rates of order $O(n^{-1/d})$, despite the smoothness of $P_{S+Z}$.
As an application, which was in fact our original motivation for the problem,
we estimate information flows in deep neural networks and discuss Tishby's
Information Bottleneck and the compression conjecture, among others.

to what is known from biology, these networks largely rely on feedforward

on supervised rather than unsupervised learning. To address these issues, we
combine traditional supervised learning via backpropagation with a specialized
unsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between neurons within
a convolutional neural network. These connections have been shown to optimally
integrate information from the surround, generating extra-classical receptive
fields for the neurons in our new proposed model (CNNEx). Models with optimal
lateral connections are more robust to noise and achieve better performance on
noisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Resistance to noise can be
further improved by combining our model with additional regularization

generalized to both datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential usefulness

The macroscopic models with phenomenological interaction functions are derived
by applying the continuum hypothesis to the microscopic model. Instead of
specifying the fPDEs with an ad hoc fractional order for nonlocal flocking
dynamics, we learn the effective nonlocal influence function in fPDEs directly
from particle trajectories generated by the agent-based simulations. We
demonstrate how the learning framework is used to connect the discrete
agent-based model to the continuum fPDEs in 1D and 2D nonlocal flocking

the microscale dynamics of each individual, while Euler equations with nonlocal
interaction terms are used to compute the evolution of macroscale quantities.
The trajectories generated by the particle simulations mimic the field data of
tracking logs that can be obtained experimentally. They can be used to learn
the fractional order of the influence function using a Gaussian process
regression model implemented with the Bayesian optimization. We show that the
numerical solution of the learned Euler equations solved by the finite volume
scheme can yield correct density distributions consistent with the collective

for each part, caused by arbitrary pose manipulations. This paper aims to
resolve these challenges induced by geometric variability and spatial
displacements via a new Soft-Gated Warping Generative Adversarial Network
(Warping-GAN), which is composed of two stages: 1) it first synthesizes a
target part segmentation map given a target pose, which depicts the
region-level spatial layouts for guiding image synthesis with higher-level
structure constraints; 2) the Warping-GAN equipped with a soft-gated
warping-block learns feature-level mapping to render textures from the original
image into the generated segmentation map. Warping-GAN is capable of
controlling different transformation degrees given distinct target poses.
Moreover, the proposed warping-block is light-weight and flexible enough to be
injected into any networks. Human perceptual studies and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our Warping-GAN that significantly
outperforms all existing methods on two large datasets.

two-dimensional semiconductor material with considerable band gaps. The present
work investigates the band gap modulation of GaS monolayer under biaxial or

GaS monolayer shows an indirect band gap that limits its optical applications.
The results show that GaS monolayer has a sizable band gap. The uniaxial strain
shifts band gap from indirect to direct in Gallium monochalcogenides (GaS).
This behavior, allowing applications such as electroluminescent devices and
laser. The detailed reasons for the band gap modulation are also discussed by
analyzing the projected density of states (PDOS). It indicates that due to the
role of p$_y$ orbital through uniaxial strain become more significant than
others near the Fermi level. The indirect to direct band gap transition happen
at $\varepsilon$=-10y$\%$. Moreover, by investigating the strain energy and
transverse response of structures under uniaxial strain, we show that the GaS

Bagging ML-BR with SMO weak classifier has the best micro-averaged f-measure

S.~Alinhac in \cite{Alinhac92} and \cite{Alinhac93} establishes that the smooth

$\ds\lim_{\ve\to 0}\ve^2 T_{\ve}=\tau_{0}^2>0$. In the present paper, for 2D

the small perturbed smooth solution exists globally when the rotationally
invariant data are a perturbation of size $\ve>0$ of a rest state. Near the
light cone, 2D Euler equations of Chaplygin gases can be transformed into a
second order quasilinear wave equation of potential, which satisfies both the
first and the second null conditions. This will lead to that the corresponding
second order quasilinear wave equation admits a global smooth solution near the

hydrodynamical waves of 2D Chaplygin gases have no decay in time and strongly
affect the related acoustical waves. Thanks to introducing a nonlinear ODE and
taking some delicate observations, we can distinguish the fast decay part and
non-decay part explicitly so that the global energy estimates with different

signal based on the absorption of light has already demonstrated its potential
for various spectroscopic applications for both gaseous and solid samples. The
signal produced during photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) measurement is,
however, usually weak and needs to be amplified. This is achieved by using a
photoacoustic cell resonator where acoustic resonances are utilized to
significantly boost the signal. Therefore, a PA resonator has a significant
role in PAS measurement set-ups. When designing or optimizing a new PA
resonator, numerical methods are generally used to simulate the photoacoustic
signal generation. In this paper, the amplitude mode expansion (AME) method is
presented as a quick and accurate simulation tool. The method is used to
simulate the photoacoustic signal in a multi-scale T-cell resonator over a wide
frequency range. The AME method is based on eigenmode expansion and
introduction of losses by quality factors. The AME simulation results are
compared and analyzed against the results from the viscothermal method.
Reasonably good agreement is obtained between the two methods. However, small
frequency shifts in the resonances of the AME method are noted. The shifts are
attributed to the location of the dominant mode within the T-cell. The
viscothermal method is considered the most accurate method for simulating the
photoacoustic signal in small resonators. However, it is computationally very
demanding. The AME method provides a much faster simulation alternative. This
is particularly useful in the design and optimization of photoacoustic
resonators where numerical methods are preferred over experimental measurements
due to their speed and low cost.

alternation graphs, also knownas word-representable graphs, it has sparked
independent interest.
  In this paper, we investigate graph operations and graph products that
preserve semitransitive orientability of graphs. The main theme of this paper
is to determine which graph operations satisfy the following statement: if a
graph operation is possible on a semitransitively orientable graph, then the
same graph operation can be executed on the graph while preserving the
semi-transitive orientability. We were able to prove that this statement is
true for edge-deletions, edge-additions, and edge-liftings. Moreover, for all
three graph operations,we showthat the initial semi-transitive orientation can
be extended to the new graph obtained by the graph operation.
  Also, Kitaev and Lozin explicitly asked if certain graph products preserve
the semitransitive orientability. We answer their question in the negative for
the tensor product, lexicographic product, and strong product.We also push the
investigation further and initiate the study of sufficient conditions that
guarantee a certain graph operation to preserve the semi-transitive

However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different

compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a
novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a
first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to
each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns
different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same
dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the
segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical
clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of
segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time
series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping
process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects
are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust
the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the
segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series

intensity profile of a 3D scene. This modality relies on constructing, for each
pixel, a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and detected
photon arrivals. In a general setting, more than one surface can be observed in
a single pixel. The problem of estimating the number of surfaces, their
reflectivity and position becomes very challenging in the low-photon regime
(which equates to short acquisition times) or relatively high background levels
(i.e., strong ambient illumination). This paper presents a new approach to 3D
reconstruction using single-photon, single-wavelength Lidar data, which is
capable of identifying multiple surfaces in each pixel. Adopting a Bayesian
approach, the 3D structure to be recovered is modelled as a marked point
process and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) moves are
proposed to sample the posterior distribution of interest. In order to promote
spatial correlation between points belonging to the same surface, we propose a
prior that combines an area interaction process and a Strauss process. New
RJ-MCMC dilation and erosion updates are presented to achieve an efficient
exploration of the configuration space. To further reduce the computational
load, we adopt a multiresolution approach, processing the data from a coarse to
the finest scale. The experiments performed with synthetic and real data show
that the algorithm obtains better reconstructions than other recently published
optimization algorithms for lower execution times.

learning search in which the agents exchange information on the quality of
their partial solutions to the puzzle and imitate the most successful agent in
the group. This scenario predicts a very poor performance in the case imitation
is too frequent or the group is too large, a phenomenon akin to Groupthink of
social psychology. The second model is the blackboard organization in which
agents read and post hints on a public blackboard. This brainstorming scenario
performs the best when there is a stringent limit to the amount of information
that is exhibited on the board. Both cooperative scenarios produce a
substantial speed up of the time to solve the puzzle as compared with the
situation where the agents work in isolation. The statistical signature of the

Taylor-Saffman bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel are prototype examples of pattern
selection. Exact solutions to the corresponding zero-surface-tension problems
exist for an arbitrary finger or bubble speed, but the addition of surface
tension leads to a discrete set of solution branches, all of which approach a
single solution in the limit the surface tension vanishes. In this sense, the
surface tension selects a single physically meaningful solution from the
continuum of zero-surface-tension solutions. Recently, we provided numerical
evidence to suggest the selection problem for a bubble propagating in an
unbounded Hele-Shaw cell behaves in an analogous way to other finger and bubble
problems in a Hele-Shaw channel; however, the selection of the ratio of bubble
speeds to background velocity appears to follow a very different surface
tension scaling to the channel cases. Here we apply techniques in exponential
asymptotics to solve the selection problem analytically, confirming the
numerical results, including the predicted surface tension scaling laws.
Further, our analysis sheds light on the multiple tips in the shape of the
bubbles along solution branches, which appear to be caused by switching on and
off exponentially small wavelike contributions across Stokes lines in a
conformally mapped plane. These results have ramifications for exotic-shaped
Saffman-Taylor fingers as well as for the time-dependent evolution of bubbles
propagating in Hele-Shaw cells.

recognition, and inexpensive RGB-D cameras and sensor-rich mobile robotic
platforms, e.g. self-driving vehicles, we investigate the relatively unexplored
problem of cross-modal re-identification of persons between RGB (color) and
depth images. The considerable divergence in data distributions across
different sensor modalities introduces additional challenges to the typical
difficulties like distinct viewpoints, occlusions, and pose and illumination
variation. While some work has investigated re-identification across RGB and
infrared, we take inspiration from successes in transfer learning from RGB to
depth in object detection tasks. Our main contribution is a novel method for
cross-modal distillation for robust person re-identification, which learns a
shared feature representation space of person's appearance in both RGB and
depth images. In addition, we propose a cross-modal attention mechanism where
the gating signal from one modality can dynamically activate the most
discriminant CNN filters of the other modality. The proposed distillation
method is compared to conventional and deep learning approaches proposed for
other cross-domain re-identification tasks. Results obtained on the public BIWI
and RobotPKU datasets indicate that the proposed method can significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art approaches by up to 16.1% in mean Average
Precision (mAP), demonstrating the benefit of the distillation paradigm. The
experimental results also indicate that using cross-modal attention allows to
improve recognition accuracy considerably with respect to the proposed
distillation method and relevant state-of-the-art approaches.

providing information-theoretic security based on the very laws of nature. In
its highest form, security is guaranteed against adversaries limited only by
the no-superluminal signalling rule of relativity. The task of randomness
amplification, to generate secure fully uniform bits starting from weakly
random seeds, is of both cryptographic and foundational interest, being
important for the generation of cryptographically secure random numbers as well
as bringing deep connections to the existence of free-will. DI no-signalling
proof protocols for this fundamental task have thus far relied on esoteric
proofs of non-locality termed pseudo-telepathy games, complicated multi-party
setups or high-dimensional quantum systems, and have remained out of reach of
experimental implementation. In this paper, we construct the first practically
relevant no-signalling proof DI protocols for randomness amplification based on
the simplest proofs of Bell non-locality and illustrate them with an
experimental implementation in a quantum optical setup using polarised photons.
Technically, we relate the problem to the vast field of Hardy paradoxes,
without which it would be impossible to achieve amplification of arbitrarily
weak sources in the simplest Bell non-locality scenario consisting of two
parties choosing between two binary inputs. Furthermore, we identify a deep
connection between proofs of the celebrated Kochen-Specker theorem and Hardy
paradoxes that enables us to construct Hardy paradoxes with the non-zero
probability taking any value in $(0,1]$. Our methods enable us, under the
fair-sampling assumption of the experiment, to realize up to $25$ bits of
randomness in $20$ hours of experimental data collection from an initial
private source of randomness $0.1$ away from uniform.

finite element solver in the HelFEM program suite that overcomes these

as wound healing or morphogenesis. To assess this role quantitatively, fixed or
live images of tissues are acquired at a cellular precision in large fields of
views. To exploit these data, large numbers of cells have to be analyzed to
extract cell shape anisotropy and cell size. Most frequently, this is performed
through detailed individual cell contour determination, using so-called
segmentation computer programs, complemented if necessary by manual detection
and error corrections. However, a coarse grained and faster technique can be
recommended in at least three situations. First, when detailed information on
individual cell contours is not required, for instance in studies which require
only coarse-grained average information on cell anisotropy. Second, as an
exploratory step to determine whether full segmentation can be potentially
useful. Third, when segmentation is too difficult, for instance due to poor
image quality or too large a cell number. We developed a user-friendly, Fourier
transform-based image analysis pipeline. It is fast (typically $10^4$ cells per
minute with a current laptop computer) and suitable for time, space or ensemble
averages. We validate it on one set of artificial images and on two sets of
fully segmented images, one from a Drosophila pupa and the other from a chicken
embryo; the pipeline results are robust. Perspectives include \textit{in vitro}
tissues, non-biological cellular patterns such as foams, and $xyz$ stacks.

HelFEM program for benchmark calculations on diatomic systems. A basis set of
the form $\chi_{nlm}(\mu,\nu,\phi)=B_{n}(\mu)Y_{l}^{m}(\nu,\phi)$ is used,
where $(\mu,\nu,\phi)$ are transformed prolate spheroidal coordinates,
$B_{n}(\mu)$ are finite element shape functions, and $Y_{l}^{m}$ are spherical
harmonics. The basis set allows for an arbitrary level of accuracy in
calculations on diatomic molecules, which can be performed at present with
either nonrelativistic Hartree--Fock (HF) or density functional (DF) theory.
Hundreds of DFs at the local spin-density approximation (LDA), generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) and the meta-GGA level can be used through an
interface with the Libxc library; meta-GGA and hybrid DFs aren't available in
other fully numerical diatomic program packages. Finite electric fields are
also supported in HelFEM, enabling access to electric properties.
  We introduce a powerful tool for adaptively choosing the basis set by using
the core Hamiltonian as a proxy for its completeness. HelFEM and the novel
basis set procedure are demonstrated by reproducing the restricted open-shell
HF limit energies of 68 diatomic molecules from the $1^{\text{st}}$ to the
$4^{\text{th}}$ period with excellent agreement with literature values, despite
requiring \emph{orders of magnitude} fewer parameters for the wave function.
Then, the electric properties of the BH and N2 molecules under finite field are
studied, again yielding excellent agreement with previous HF limit values for
energies, dipole moments, and dipole polarizabilities, again with much more
compact wave functions than what were needed in the literature references.
Finally, HF, LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA calculations of the atomization energy of
N2 are performed, demonstrating the superb accuracy of the present approach.

speed of convergence of the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. Popular
choices for the initial guess include the one-electron guess from the core

densities (SAD).
  Here, we discuss alternative guesses obtained from the superposition of
atomic potentials (SAP), which is easily implementable even in real-space

purification of the density matrix that could also be used in real-space
calculations, as well as a parameter-free variant of the extended H\""uckel

existing SAD infrastructure.
  The performance of the core Hamiltonian, the SAD and the SAP guesses as well

on a dataset of 259 molecules ranging from the first to the fourth periods by
projecting the guess orbitals onto precomputed, converged SCF solutions in
single- to triple-{\zeta} basis sets. It is shown that the proposed SAP guess
is the best guess on average. The extended H\""uckel guess offers a good
alternative, with less scatter in accuracy.

motivated by a biological phenomenon called transcript slippage (TS). In this
model a discrete lattice represents a DNA strand while each of the particles
that hop on it unidirectionally, from site to site, represents a RNA polymerase
(RNAP). While walking like a molecular motor along a DNA track in a
step-by-step manner, a RNAP simultaneously synthesizes a RNA chain; in each
forward step it elongates the nascent RNA molecule by one unit, using the DNA
track also as the template. At some special ""slippery"" position on the DNA,
which we represent as a defect on the lattice, a RNAP can lose its grip on the
nascent RNA and the latter's consequent slippage results in a final product
that is either longer or shorter than the corresponding DNA template. We
develope an exclusion model for RNAP traffic where the kinetics of the system
at the defect site captures key features of TS events. We demonstrate the
interplay of the crowding of RNAPs and TS. A RNAP has to wait at the defect
site for longer period in a more congested RNAP traffic, thereby increasing the
likelihood of its suffering a larger number of TS events. The qualitative
trends of some of our results for a simple special case of our model are
consistent with experimental observations. The general theoretical framework
presented here will be useful for guiding future experimental queries and for
analysis of the experimental data with more detailed versions of the same
model.

marginal likelihoods and implemented posterior sampling procedures that
simultaneously estimate the model discrepancy of physical models, and the
measurement bias from the atmospheric error in satellite interferograms. We
found that model calibration by aggregating multiple interferograms and
downsampling the pixels in the interferograms can reduce the computation
complexity compared to calibration approaches based on multiple data sets. The
conditions that lead to no loss of information from data aggregation and
downsampling are studied. Simulation illustrates that both discrepancy and

this effect to magnon kinetic processes, which give rise to band-minimum

very little attempt is done in classifying or comparing IoT middleware

circumvented without invoking any moment closure technique. Local stabilization

area of optical communications, due to the resulting marked improvement in

detection, digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC) schemes such as digital
backpropagation (DBP) and Volterra equalization have received much attention.
Alternatively, optical NLC, and specifically optical phase conjugation (OPC),
has been proposed to relax the digital signal processing complexity. In this
work, a novel hybrid optical-digital NLC scheme combining OPC and a Volterra
equalizer is proposed, termed Volterra-Assisted OPC (VAO). It has a twofold
advantage: it overcomes the OPC limitation in asymmetric links and
substantially enhances the performance of Volterra equalizers. The proposed
scheme is shown to outperform both OPC and Volterra equalization alone by up to
4.2 dB in a 1000 km EDFA-amplified fiber link. Moreover, VAO is also
demonstrated to be very robust when applied to long-transmission distances,
with a 2.5 dB gain over OPC-only systems at 3000 km. VAO combines the
advantages of both optical and digital NLC offering a promising trade-off
between performance and complexity for future high-speed optical communication
systems.

the communication range, enhance network connectivity, and provide a more
precise network localization scheme. In this regard, this paper investigates
the connectivity of underwater optical wireless sensor networks (UOWSNs) and
its impacts on the network localization performance. Firstly, we model UOWSNs
as randomly scaled sector graphs where the connection between sensors is
established by point-to-point directed links. Thereafter, the probability of
network connectivity is analytically derived as a function of network density,
communication range, and optical transmitters' divergence angle. Secondly, the
network localization problem is formulated as an unconstrained optimization
problem and solved using the conjugate gradient technique. Numerical results
show that different network parameters such as the number of nodes, divergence
angle, and transmission range significantly influence the probability of a
connected network. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed localization
technique is compared to well-known network localization schemes and the
results show that the localization accuracy of the proposed technique
outperforms the literature in terms of network connectivity, ranging error, and

this paper, we generalize these topological electromagnetic phases beyond the
continuum approximation to the exact lattice field theory of a periodic atomic
