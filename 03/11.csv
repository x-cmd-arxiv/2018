blockade in a quadratically coupled optomechanical system, where a strong
nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons can be induced by an external
field coherently driving the cavity, and the effective coupling strength is
tunable by adjusting the amplitude of the driving field. This optically induced
nonlinearity is different from standard methods for realization of phonon
blockade, where the nonlinearity is achieved by coupling the mechanical system
to superconducting qubits. We both analytically and numerically study the

a large cooperativity of the system, which is achievable based on the optically
enhanced nonlinear coupling and high quality mechanical system.

upper limit on the turbulent broadening of $<$0.08c$_s$ ($\alpha<$0.007 for
$\alpha$ defined only within 2-3 pressure scale heights above the midplane),
lower than the tentative detection previously found from an analysis of the
CO(2-1) data. We examine in detail the challenges of image plane fitting vs
directly fitting the visibilities, while also considering the role of the
vertical temperature gradient, systematic uncertainty in the amplitude
calibration, and assumptions about the CO abundance, as potential sources of
the discrepancy in the turbulence measurements. These tests result in
variations of the turbulence limit between $<$0.04c$_s$ and $<$0.13c$_s$,
consistently lower than the 0.2-0.4c$_s$ found previously. Having ruled out
numerous factors, we restrict the source of the discrepancy to our assumed
coupling between temperature and density through hydrostatic equilibrium in the
presence of a vertical temperature gradient and/or the confinement of CO to a
thin molecular layer above the midplane, although further work is needed to
quantify the influence of these prescriptions. Assumptions about hydrostatic
equilibrium and the CO distribution are physically motivated, and may have a
small influence on measuring the kinematics of the gas, but they become
important when constraining small effects such as the strength of the

interactions and change in the nature of the degrees of freedom. We have
studied several thermodynamic functions within the I-HRG model and try to
identify the region of the QCD phase diagram where it becomes essential to
include non-ideal effects into the I-HRG model. We work with only those
thermodynamic quantities that show a monotonic rise with $T$ and $\mu_B$ in
I-HRG. Their high temperature limiting values where QCD becomes simply a
Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) gas of massless quarks and gluons is known. The rise of
these quantities in I-HRG beyond the corresponding SB limit values indicate the
need to include interactions into I-HRG to study QCD thermodynamics. This works
as a guiding principle on the QCD phase diagram where interacting HRG can take
over from I-HRG. For $\mu_B/T\leq2$, $\chi^Q_2$ shoots the SB limit at the

scene pairs like human? In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised
algorithm to address the problem of localizing the sound source in visual
scenes. A two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with
attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization. Moreover,
although our network is formulated within the unsupervised learning framework,
it can be extended to a unified architecture with a simple modification for the
supervised and semi-supervised learning settings as well. Meanwhile, a new
sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation. Our empirical
evaluation shows that the unsupervised method eventually go through false
conclusion in some cases. We show that even with a few supervision, false
conclusion is able to be corrected and the source of sound in a visual scene
can be localized effectively.

surgery. For microscopic scenarios, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is
increasingly used as an imaging modality. OCT is suitable for accurate pose
estimation due to its micrometer range resolution and volumetric field of view.
However, OCT image processing is challenging due to speckle noise and
reflection artifacts in addition to the images' 3D nature. We address pose
estimation from OCT volume data with a new deep learning-based tracking
framework. For this purpose, we design a new 3D convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture to directly predict the 6D pose of a small marker geometry
from OCT volumes. We use a hexapod robot to automatically acquire labeled data
points which we use to train 3D CNN architectures for multi-output regression.
We use this setup to provide an in-depth analysis on deep learning-based pose
estimation from volumes. Specifically, we demonstrate that exploiting volume
information for pose estimation yields higher accuracy than relying on 2D
representations with depth information. Supporting this observation, we provide
quantitative and qualitative results that 3D CNNs effectively exploit the depth
structure of marker objects. Regarding the deep learning aspect, we present
efficient design principles for 3D CNNs, making use of insights from the 2D
deep learning community. In particular, we present Inception3D as a new
architecture which performs best for our application. We show that our deep
learning approach reaches errors at our ground-truth label's resolution. We
achieve a mean average error of $\SI{14.89 \pm 9.3}{\micro\metre}$ and
$\SI{0.096 \pm 0.072}{\degree}$ for position and orientation learning,

by the suprathermal electron imager (SEI) instrument. Consistent ion heating
and flow velocity characteristics are observed from both the SEI and the
rapid-scanning ion mass spectrometer (IRM) instruments. We find that transverse
O+ ion heating in the ionosphere can be intense (up to 4.5 eV), confined to
very narrow regions (~ 2 km across B), is more likely to occur in the downward
current region, and is associated with broadband extremely low frequency
(BBELF) waves. These waves are interpreted as linearly polarized perpendicular
to the magnetic field. The amount of ion heating cannot be explained by
frictional heating, and the correlation of ion heating with BBELF waves suggest
that significant wave-ion heating is occurring and even dominating at altitudes
as low as 350 km, a boundary that is lower than previously reported.
Surprisingly, the majority of these heating events (17 out 24) are associated
with core ion downflows rather than upflows. This may be explained by a
downward-pointing electric field in the low-altitude return current region.

popular research direction because of freely available web resources, which is
also referred to as webly supervised learning. Nevertheless, the performance

still very large, owning to the label noise of web data. To be exact, the
labels of images crawled from public websites are very noisy and often

the aid of extra information, such as augmenting or purifying web data by
virtue of instance-level supervision, which is usually in demand of heavy

more accessible category-level supervision. In particular, we build our method
upon variational autoencoder (VAE), in which the classification network is

The effectiveness of our proposed method is clearly demonstrated by extensive

  In contrast, the field of econophysics starts from the premise that modern
economies consist of a vast number of individual actors with heterogeneous
expectations and incentives. In turn explaining observed market statistics as
emerging from the collective dynamics of many actors following heterogeneous,

(either in the lab or computationally). One such construction, which we explore
here, involves setting up the Delaunay triangulation of a Poisson disk sampling
and then removing edges to maximize the bulk modulus until the isostatic plus
one point is reached. This construction works in any dimensions and here we
give results in 2D where we also show how such networks can be transformed into
a disk pack.

dramatically alter model output using small input changes. We propose Neural
Fingerprinting, a simple, yet effective method to detect adversarial examples
by verifying whether model behavior is consistent with a set of secret
fingerprints, inspired by the use of biometric and cryptographic signatures.
The benefits of our method are that 1) it is fast, 2) it is prohibitively
expensive for an attacker to reverse-engineer which fingerprints were used, and
3) it does not assume knowledge of the adversary. In this work, we pose a
formal framework to analyze fingerprints under various threat models, and
characterize Neural Fingerprinting for linear models. For complex neural
networks, we empirically demonstrate that Neural Fingerprinting significantly
improves on state-of-the-art detection mechanisms by detecting the strongest
known adversarial attacks with 98-100% AUC-ROC scores on the MNIST, CIFAR-10
and MiniImagenet (20 classes) datasets. In particular, the detection accuracy
of Neural Fingerprinting generalizes well to unseen test-data under various
black- and whitebox threat models, and is robust over a wide range of
hyperparameters and choices of fingerprints.

bivariate summary of sensitivity and specificity. Then a final model was
selected using the proposed empirical likelihood method. Simulation scenarios
were conducted based on different number of studies and different population

of particles are widely used to quantify the anisotropy in particle emission in
high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The symmetric cumulants, $SC(m,n)$, are used
to measure the correlations between different orders of flow harmonics. These
correlations are used to constrain the initial conditions and the transport
properties of the medium in theoretical models. In this Letter, we present the
first measurements of the four-particle symmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 and 200 GeV from data collected by the STAR experiment
at RHIC. We observe that $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ are anti-correlated in all
centrality intervals with similar correlation strengths from 39 GeV Au+Au to
2.76 TeV Pb+Pb (measured by the ALICE experiment). The $v_{2}$-$v_{4}$
correlation seems to be stronger at 39 GeV than at higher collision energies.
The initial-stage anti-correlations between second and third order
eccentricities are sufficient to describe the measured correlations between
$v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$. The best description of $v_{2}$-$v_{4}$ correlations at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV is obtained with inclusion of the system's nonlinear
response to initial eccentricities accompanied by the viscous effect with
$\eta/s$ $>$ 0.08. Theoretical calculations using different initial conditions,
equations of state and viscous coefficients need to be further explored to
extract $\eta/s$ of the medium created at RHIC.

bound of the slope of fibered $3$-folds over curves is $4/3$, and it occurs
only when the general fiber is a $(1, 2)$-surface. Otherwise, the sharp lower

time-consuming step is the routing of nets. Therefore, there is a need to
accelerate it. In a recent paper by Hoo et. al., the authors have developed a
Linear Programming based framework that parallelizes this routing process to
achieve significant speedups (the algorithm is termed as ParaLaR). However,
this approach has certain weaknesses. Namely, the constraints violation by the
solution and a local minima that could be improved. We address these two issues
here.
  In our paper, we use this framework and solve it using the Primal-Dual
sub-gradient method that better exploits the problem properties. We also
propose a better way to update the size of the step taken by this iterative
algorithm. We perform experiments on a set of standard benchmarks, where we
show that our algorithm outperforms the standard existing algorithms (VPR and
ParaLaR).
  We achieve up to 22% improvement in the constraints violation and the
standard metric of the minimum channel width when compared with ParaLaR (which
is same as in VPR). We achieve about 20% savings in another standard metric of
the total wire length (when compared with VPR), which is the same as for
ParaLaR. Hence, our algorithm achieves minimum value for all the three
parameters. Also, the critical path delay for our algorithm is almost same as
compared to VPR and ParaLaR. We achieve relative speedups of 3 times when we
run a parallel version of our algorithm using 4 threads.

confirmed the raising effect in He and Rao (2013), i.e., young speakers realize
/a/ as [epsilon] in /an/, whereas older speakers in the most part realize it as
[ae]. Also, female speakers raise more than male speakers within the same age

parameters: P_orb = 131.27+/-0.09 days, semi-amplitude K_1 = 51.7+/-3.0 km/s,
systemic radial velocity gamma = -31.8+/-2.6 km/s, and a mass function of f(m)

the material is distributed near the B-type component and in a circumbinary

improve on a standard photometric warp loss by considering a warp of deep

single view depth and visual odometry improves depth prediction because of the
additional constraint imposed on depths and achieves competitive results for
visual odometry; (ii) deep feature-based warping loss improves upon simple
photometric warp loss for both single view depth estimation and visual

log-spectral estimate, $\hat{\theta}_{\nu}(f,t) \equiv \ln(|y_{nu}(f,t)|^2$, is
smoothed. As the characteristic widths of the kernel smoother increase, the
bias from temporal and frequency averaging increases while the variance
decreases. The demodulation parameters, such as the order, length, and
bandwidth of spectral taper and the kernel smoother, are determined by
minimizing the expected error. For well-resolved evolutionary spectra, the
optimal taper length is a small fraction of the optimal kernel half-width. The
optimal frequency bandwidth, $w$, for the spectral window scales as $w^2
\approx \lambda_F/ \tau $, where $\tau$ is the characteristic time, and
$\lambda_F$ is the characteristic frequency scale-length. In contrast, the
optimal half-widths for the second stage kernel smoother scales as $h \approx

smoother. The ratio of the optimal frequency half-width to the optimal time
half-width satisfies $h_F / h_T ~ (|\partial_t ^p \theta | / |\partial_f^p

we initially estimate $|\partial_t^p \theta|^2$ and $|\partial_f^p \theta|^2$

studies of filaments in the nonparametric kernel density estimation context.
This paper supplements the current literature in two ways. First, we provide a
Bayesian approach to the filament estimation in regression context and study
the posterior contraction rates using a finite random series of B-splines
basis. Compared with the kernel-estimation method, this has a theoretical
advantage as the bias can be better controlled when the function is smoother,
which allows obtaining better rates. Assuming that $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto
\mathbb{R}$ belongs to an isotropic H\""{o}lder class of order $\alpha \geq 4$,
with the optimal choice of smoothing parameters, the posterior contraction
rates for the filament points on some appropriately defined integral curves and
for the Hausdorff distance of the filament are both $(n/\log
n)^{(2-\alpha)/(2(1+\alpha))}$. Secondly, we provide a way to construct a
credible set with sufficient frequentist coverage for the filaments. We
demonstrate the success of our proposed method in simulations and one

address this challenge by learning performance models based on a sample set of

insight of this paper is that choosing a suitable source (a.k.a. ""bellwether"")

much more complex transfer learning methods. Using this insight, this paper
proposes BEETLE, a novel bellwether based transfer learning scheme, which can

interplay among network topology, system inertia, and generator and load
damping in determining the overall grid behavior and performance. Specifically,
we show that the impact of network topology on a power system can be quantified
through the network Laplacian eigenvalues, and such eigenvalues determine the
grid robustness against low frequency disturbances. Moreover, we can explicitly
decompose the frequency signal along scaled Laplacian eigenvectors when
damping-inertia ratios are uniform across buses. The insight revealed by this
framework partially explains why load-side participation in frequency
regulation not only makes the system respond faster, but also helps lower the
system nadir after a disturbance. Finally, by presenting a new controller
specifically tailored to suppress high frequency disturbances, we demonstrate
that our results can provide useful guidelines in the controller design for
load-side primary frequency regulation. This improved controller is simulated
on the IEEE 39-bus New England interconnection system to illustrate its
robustness against high frequency oscillations compared to both the
conventional droop control and a recent controller design.

coronagraph that provides deep starlight suppression over a broad spectral
bandwidth, high throughput for point sources at small angular separation, and
insensitivity to temporally-varying, low-order aberrations. Vortex coronagraphs
are a promising solution that perform optimally on off-axis, monolithic
telescopes and may also be designed for segmented telescopes with minor losses
in performance. We describe the key advantages of vortex coronagraphs on
off-axis telescopes: 1) Unwanted diffraction due to aberrations is passively
rejected in several low-order Zernike modes relaxing the wavefront stability
requirements for imaging Earth-like planets from <10 to >100 pm rms. 2) Stars
with angular diameters >0.1 $\lambda/D$ may be sufficiently suppressed. 3) The
absolute planet throughput is >10%, even for unfavorable telescope
architectures. 4) Broadband solutions ($\Delta\lambda/\lambda>0.1$) are readily
available for both monolithic and segmented apertures. The latter make use of
grayscale apodizers in an upstream pupil plane to provide suppression of
diffracted light from amplitude discontinuities in the telescope pupil without
inducing additional stroke on the deformable mirrors. We set wavefront
stability requirements on the telescope, based on a stellar irradiance
threshold set at an angular separation of 3$\pm$0.5 $\lambda/D$ from the star,
and discuss how some requirements may be relaxed by trading robustness to
aberrations for planet throughput.

network traffic using geographically distributed caches. However, each deployed
cache has an associated cost, and under time-varying request rates (e.g., a
daily cycle) there may be long periods when the request rate from the local
region is not high enough to justify this cost. Cloud computing offers a
solution to problems of this kind, by supporting dynamic allocation and release
of resources. In this paper, we analyze the potential benefits from dynamically
instantiating caches using resources from cloud service providers. We develop
novel analytic caching models that accommodate time-varying request rates,
transient behavior as a cache fills following instantiation, and selective
cache insertion policies. Within the context of a simple cost model, we then
develop bounds and compare policies with optimized parameter selections to
obtain insights into key cost/performance tradeoffs. We find that dynamic cache
instantiation can provide substantial cost reductions, that potential
reductions strongly dependent on the object popularity skew, and that selective
cache insertion can be even more beneficial in this context than with
conventional edge caches. Finally, our contributions also include accurate and
easy-to-compute approximations that are shown applicable to LRU caches under

form of permutation operators. Results are established on how these
discretizations approximate the Koopman operator spectrally. Specificaly, it is
shown that both the spectral measure and the spectral projectors of these

the spectra of volume-preserving maps on the unit $m$-torus. The discretized

illuminators, is of particular interest for numerous applications ranging from
robotics and transportation to mixed and augmented reality. The ability to
quantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used
for map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor
setup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data
correctly in instances where range measurements are taken from different
vantage points or with different sensors. The weighing is important to fuse
range data into a map in a meaningful way, i.e., the high confidence data is
relied on most heavily. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the
range error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and
validate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured
light stereo system. The experiments confirm the validity of the model and
simplify the application of this type of sensor in robotics. The proposed error
model is relevant to any stereo system with low ambient light where the main
light source is located at the camera system. Among others, this is the case
for structured light stereo systems and night stereo systems with headlights.
In this work, we propose that the range error is cubic in range for stereo
systems with integrated illuminators. Experimental validation with an
off-the-shelf structured light stereo system shows that the exponent is between
2.4 and 2.6. The deviation is attributed to our model considering only shot
noise.

progress toward this goal. First we present the Gordon form for an
approximation to Kerr spacetime in the slow-rotation limit, obtained by
suitably modifying the well-known Lense-Thirring form of the slow-rotation

cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing
voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical
relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal
micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is
injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohm's law, showing that
the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties.
For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law
that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction.
Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the
distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude,
electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in
neuronal microdomains.

a local volatility type modelling for the asset price S(t) with a stochastic

time-consuming because of the multi-dimensional nature of the problem. In this
paper, we develop a calibration technique based on a partial differential
equation (PDE) approach which allows an efficient implementation. The essential
idea is based on solving the derived forward equation satisfied by P(t; S;
r)Z(t; S; r), where P(t; S; r) represents the risk neutral probability density
of (S(t); r(t)) and Z(t; S; r) the projection of the stochastic discounting
factor in the state variables (S(t); r(t)). The solution provides effective and
sufficient information for the calibration and pricing. The PDE solver is
constructed by using ADI (Alternative Direction Implicit) method based on an
extension of the Peaceman-Rachford scheme. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm
to compute all the corrective terms in the local volatility function due to the
stochastic interest rates is proposed by using the PDE solutions and grid
points. Different numerical experiments are examined and compared to
demonstrate the results of our theoretical analysis.

Building on this simple model, we consider a two-lane lattice-gas model that
couples directed transport (TASEP) to diffusive motion in a semi-closed
geometry, and simultaneously accounts for spontaneous growth and
particle-induced shrinkage of the system's size. This particular extension of
the TASEP is motivated by the question of how active transport and diffusion
might influence length regulation in confined systems. Surprisingly, we find
that the size of our intrinsically stochastic system exhibits robust temporal
patterns over a broad range of growth rates. More specifically, when particle
diffusion is slow relative to the shrinkage dynamics, we observe quasi-periodic
changes in length. We provide an intuitive explanation for the occurrence of
these self-organized temporal patterns, which is based on the imbalance between
the diffusion and shrinkage speed in the confined geometry. Finally, we
formulate an effective theory for the oscillatory regime, which explains the
origin of the oscillations and correctly predicts the dependence of key
quantities, as for instance the oscillation frequency, on the growth rate.

comparable to the duration of a typical jet-launching episode in the jittering

extension for secure computing. SeM uses a small amount of in-chip additional
hardware that monitors key communication channels inside the CPU chip, and only
acts when required. SeM provides confidentiality and integrity for a secure
program without trusting the platform software or any off-chip hardware. SeM
supports existing binaries of single- and multi-threaded applications running
on single- or multi-core, multi-CPU. The performance reduction caused by it is
only few percent, most of which is due to the memory encryption layer that is
commonly used in many secure architectures.
  We also developed SeM-Prepare, a software tool that automatically instruments
existing applications (binaries) with additional instructions so they can be
securely executed on our architecture without requiring any programming efforts
or the availability of the desired program`s source code.
  To enable secure data sharing in shared memory environments, we developed
Secure Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM), an efficient (time and memory)
algorithm for allowing thousands of compute nodes to share data securely while
running on an untrusted computing environment. SDSM shows a negligible
reduction in performance, and it requires negligible and hardware resources. We
developed Distributed Memory Integrity Trees, a method for enhancing single
node integrity trees for preserving the integrity of a distributed application
running on an untrusted computing environment. We show that our method is
applicable to existing single node integrity trees such as Merkle Tree, Bonsai
Merkle Tree, and Intel`s SGX memory integrity engine. All these building blocks
may be used together to form a practical secure system, and some can be used in
conjunction with other secure systems.

nanoseconds is essential for the formation of submicron complexes of lipids and
proteins in the cell membrane. These dynamics are difficult to access
experimentally and are currently poorly understood. One of the conclusions of
the celebrated Saffman-Debr\""uck (SD) theory is that lipid disturbances smaller
than the Saffman length (microns) are not affected by the hydrodynamics of the
embedding solvent. Using molecular dynamics and coarse-grained models with
implicit hydrodynamics we show that this is not true. Hydrodynamic interactions
between the membrane and the solvent strongly enhance the short-time collective
diffusion of lipids at all scales. The momentum transferred between the
membrane and the solvent in normal direction (not considered by the SD theory)
propagates tangentially over the membrane inducing long-ranged repulsive forces
amongst lipids. As a consequence the lipid collective diffusion coefficient
increases proportionally to the disturbance wavelength. We find quantitative
agreement with the predicted anomalous diffusion in quasi-two-dimensional
dynamics, observed in colloids confined to a plane but embedded in 3D solvent.

important factor for the diagnosis of ophthalmological diseases. Vessel
segmentation in fundus images is a challenging task due to complex vessel
structure, the presence of similar structures such as microaneurysms and
hemorrhages, micro-vessel with only one to several pixels wide, and
requirements for finer results. Methods:In this paper, we present a multi-scale
deeply supervised network with short connections (BTS-DSN) for vessel
segmentation. We used short connections to transfer semantic information
between side-output layers. Bottom-top short connections pass low level
semantic information to high level for refining results in high-level
side-outputs, and top-bottom short connection passes much structural
information to low level for reducing noises in low-level side-outputs. In
addition, we employ cross-training to show that our model is suitable for real
world fundus images. Results: The proposed BTS-DSN has been verified on DRIVE,
STARE and CHASE_DB1 datasets, and showed competitive performance over other
state-of-the-art methods. Specially, with patch level input, the network
achieved 0.7891/0.8212 sensitivity, 0.9804/0.9843 specificity, 0.9806/0.9859
AUC, and 0.8249/0.8421 F1-score on DRIVE and STARE, respectively. Moreover, our
model behaves better than other methods in cross-training experiments.
Conclusions: BTS-DSN achieves competitive performance in vessel segmentation

variability in flux or color. On longer timescales, multiple flaring events
were seen. Large changes in color with respect to time and in a
color--magnitude diagram were seen, and while only a weak systematic
variability trend was noticed in color with respect to time, the
color--magnitude diagram shows a bluer-when-brighter trend. Large changes in
the degree of polarization, and substantial swings in the polarization angle
were detected. The fractional Stokes parameters of the polarization showed a
systematic trend with time in the beginning of these observations, followed by
chaotic changes and then an apparently systematic variation at the end. These
polarization changes coincide with the detection and duration of the source at
very high energies as seen by VERITAS. The spectral index shows a systematic

intrusion detection systems (IDSs). However, practical IDSs generally update
their decision module by feeding new data then retraining learning models in a
periodical way. Hence, some attacks that comprise the data for training or
testing classifiers significantly challenge the detecting capability of machine
learning-based IDSs. Poisoning attack, which is one of the most recognized
security threats towards machine learning-based IDSs, injects some adversarial
samples into the training phase, inducing data drifting of training data and a
significant performance decrease of target IDSs over testing data. In this
paper, we adopt the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel
poisoning method that attack against several machine learning algorithms used
in IDSs. Specifically, we propose a boundary pattern detection algorithm to
efficiently generate the points that are near to abnormal data but considered
to be normal ones by current classifiers. Then, we introduce a Batch-EPD
Boundary Pattern (BEBP) detection algorithm to overcome the limitation of the
number of edge pattern points generated by EPD and to obtain more useful
adversarial samples. Based on BEBP, we further present a moderate but effective
poisoning method called chronic poisoning attack. Extensive experiments on

is characterised by a well developed Red Sequence (RS), a Blue Cloud (BC) and
the so-called Green Valley (GV). Loose, less evolved groups of galaxies likely
not virialized yet may lack a well defined RS. This is actually explained in
the framework of galaxy evolution. We are focussing on understanding galaxy
migration towards the RS, checking for signatures of such a transition in their
photometric and morphological properties. We report on the UV properties of a
sample of ETGs galaxies inhabiting the RS. The analysis of their structures, as
derived by fitting a Sersic law to their UV luminosity profiles, suggests the
presence of an underlying disk. This is the hallmark of dissipation processes
that still must have a role in the evolution of this class of galaxies. SPH
simulations with chemo-photometric implementations able to match the global
properties of our targets are used to derive their evolutionary paths through
UV-optical CDM, providing some fundamental information such as the crossing
time through the GV, which depends on their luminosity. The transition from the
BC to the RS takes several Gyrs, being about 3-5 Gyr for the the brightest
galaxies and more long for fainter ones, if it occurs. The photometric study of
nearby galaxy structures in UV is seriously hampered by either the limited FoV
of the cameras (e.g in HST) or by the low spatial resolution of the images (e.g
in the GALEX). Current missions equipped with telescopes and cameras sensitive
to UV wavelengths, such as Swift-UVOT and Astrosat-UVIT, provide a relatively
large FoV and better resolution than the GALEX. More powerful UV instruments
(size, resolution and FoV) are obviously bound to yield fundamental advances in
the accuracy and depth of the surface photometry and in the characterisation of
the galaxy environment.

to construct an accurate and efficient numerical method. Several numerical

broadcast channel, in which there is a single sender and multiple receivers. We
divide the receivers into two sets: the decoding set and the malicious set. The
decoding set and the malicious set can either be disjoint or can have a finite
intersection. For simplicity, we say that a single party Bob has access to the
decoding set and another party Eve has access to the malicious set, and both
Eve and Bob have access to the pre-shared entanglement with Alice. The goal of
the task is for Alice to communicate classical information reliably to Bob and
securely against Eve, and Bob can take advantage of pre-shared entanglement
with Alice. In this framework, we establish a lower bound on the one-shot EA
private capacity. When there exists a quantum channel mapping the state of the
decoding set to the state of the malicious set, such a broadcast channel is
said to be degraded. We establish an upper bound on the one-shot EA private
capacity in terms of smoothed min- and max-entropies for such channels. In the
limit of a large number of independent channel uses, we prove that the EA
private capacity of a degraded quantum broadcast channel is given by a
single-letter formula. Finally, we consider two specific examples of degraded
broadcast channels and find their capacities. In the first example, we consider
the scenario in which one part of Bob's laboratory is compromised by Eve. We
show that the capacity for this protocol is given by the conditional quantum
mutual information of a quantum broadcast channel, and so we thus provide an
operational interpretation to the dynamic counterpart of the conditional
quantum mutual information. In the second example, Eve and Bob have access to
mutually exclusive sets of outputs of a broadcast channel.

graded (FG) nanobeams are investigated. This study reports the changes in the
geometry and dynamics of FG nanobeams because of changes in their surface
textures and/or surface mechanical properties. A new model for FG nanobeams
with engineering surfaces is developed. This engineering surface is considered
as a different material phase with a surface texture (waviness and roughness).
The initial curvatures of cantilever, simple supported, and clamped-clamped FG
nanobeams due to surface residual stresses are determined. Moreover, their
natural frequencies and mode shapes are derived depending on surface integrity.
The initial curvatures of FG beams are obtained increasing with an increase in
the slope of the surface texture and/or a decrease in the heights of the
surface roughness. Moreover, it is observed that the natural frequencies of FG
beams may decrease or increase due surface integrity depending on the boundary
conditions. Thus, as a first prospect, the surface roughness allows the
vibration energy to propagation over the beam length and hence its natural
frequency decreases resulting in a zero-frequency mode. As for the other
prospect, surface roughness inhibits the propagation of the vibration energy
through the beam length leading to a mode localization. It is revealed that a
mode localization is accompanied with an increase in the natural frequency of
the nanobeam. The proposed surface integrity model for FG nanobeams is compared
with Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity model. The results demonstrate that the
surface integrity model is preferred over the former model where it accounts
for, both, surface texture and surface mechanical properties effects. However,
Gurtin-Murdoch model assumes smooth surfaces of nanobeams which leads to
under/overestimations of their mechanics.

dynamical processes arising in several natural and man made systems. Notably,
examples include neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG)
that captures the variation in potential fields, and blood oxygenation level
dependent (BOLD) signal, which serves as a proxy for neuronal activity.
Notwithstanding, the complex networks originated by locally measuring EEG and
BOLD are often treated as isolated networks and do not capture the dependency
from external stimuli, e.g., originated in subcortical structures such as the
thalamus and the brain stem. Therefore, we propose a paradigm-shift towards the
analysis of such complex networks under unknown unknowns (i.e., excitations).
Consequently, the main contributions of the present paper are threefold: (i) we
present an alternating scheme that enables to determine the best estimate of
the model parameters and unknown stimuli; (ii) we provide necessary and
sufficient conditions to ensure that it is possible to retrieve the state and
unknown stimuli; and (iii) upon these conditions we determine a small subset of
variables that need to be measured to ensure that both state and input can be
recovered, while establishing sub-optimality guarantees with respect to the
smallest possible subset. Finally, we present several pedagogical examples of
the main results using real data collected from an EEG wearable device.

  Applications to Clinical Facial Surgical Planning",,,,,"cs.CV math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is difficult to estimate the midsagittal plane of human subjects with
craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. We have developed a LAndmark GEometric
Routine (LAGER), which automatically estimates a midsagittal plane for such
subjects. The LAGER algorithm was based on the assumption that the optimal
midsagittal plane of a patient with a deformity is the premorbid midsagittal
plane of the patient (i.e. hypothetically normal without deformity). The LAGER
algorithm consists of three steps. The first step quantifies the asymmetry of
the landmarks using a Euclidean distance matrix analysis and ranks the
landmarks according to their degree of asymmetry. The second step uses a
recursive algorithm to drop outlier landmarks. The third step inputs the
remaining landmarks into an optimization algorithm to determine an optimal
midsaggital plane. We validate LAGER on 20 synthetic models mimicking the
skulls of real patients with CMF deformities. The results indicated that all
the LAGER algorithm-generated midsagittal planes met clinical criteria. Thus it
can be used clinically to determine the midsagittal plane for patients with CMF
deformities.

Knapsack Problem is $\#P$ hard, so only approximations are envisageable. A
Markov chain allowing uniform sampling of all possible solutions is given by
Luby, Randall and Sinclair. In 2005, Morris and Sinclair, by using a flow
argument, have shown that the mixing time of this Markov chain is
$\mathcal{O}(n^{9/2+\epsilon})$, for any $\epsilon > 0$. By using a canonical
path argument on the distributive lattice structure of the set of solutions, we
obtain an improved bound, the mixing time is given as $\tau_{_{x}}(\epsilon)
\leq n^{3} \ln (16 \epsilon^{-1})$.

vertices, or of the vertices themselves, and the large amount of symmetry
present in real-world complex networks is inherited by such measures. This has
practical consequences which have not yet been explored in full generality, nor
systematically exploited by network practitioners. Here we study the effect of
network symmetry on arbitrary network measures, and show how this can be
exploited in practice in a number of ways, from redundancy compression, to
computational reduction. We also uncover the spectral signatures of symmetry
for an arbitrary network measure such as the graph Laplacian. Computing network
symmetries is very efficient in practice, and we test real-world examples up to
several million nodes. Since network models are ubiquitous in the Applied
Sciences, and typically contain a large degree of structural redundancy, our
results are not only significant, but widely applicable.

two parameter generalized entropy of Hanel and Thurner (2011), using the c,d
parameters as labels of the corresponding manifolds. Here we follow a
completely different approach by considering these parameters as coordinates of
our information manifolds. This gives a manageable two-dimensional manifold
amenable to easy manipulations but most importantly it offers a direct
characterization of complex systems in terms of the pair of the c,d values. As
a result we obtain certain characteristic values from the scalar curvature
which we could conjecture that they represent complex systems with specific
behavior. It is further observed that the boundary values of the c,d parameters
which characterize the Hanel-Thurner classification are in some sense singular.
This asks for a regularization scheme which we try to establish.
