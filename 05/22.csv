$2^+\rightarrow 0^+$, ground-state transition in the $\beta$ decay of $^{20}$F.
A low-energy, mass-separated $^{20}\rm{F}^+$ beam produced at the IGISOL
facility in Jyv\""askyl\""a, Finland, was implanted in a thin carbon foil and the
$\beta$ spectrum measured using a magnetic transporter and a
plastic-scintillator detector. The $\beta$-decay branching ratio inferred from
the measurement is $b_{\beta} = [ 0.41\pm 0.08\textrm{(stat)}\pm
0.07\textrm{(sys)}] \times 10^{-5}$ corresponding to $\log ft = 10.89(11)$,
making this one of the strongest second-forbidden, non-unique $\beta$
transitions ever measured. The experimental result is supported by shell-model
calculations and has significant implications for the final evolution of stars
that develop degenerate oxygen-neon cores. Using the new experimental data, we
argue that the astrophysical electron-capture rate on $^{20}$Ne is now known to
within better than 25% at the relevant temperatures and densities.

models. Previously, we began investigating toy models for the 5-D analog of the
kinetic mixing/vector portal scenario where the interactions of bulk dark
matter with the brane-localized fields of the Standard Model are mediated by a
massive $U(1)_D$ dark photon also living in the bulk. In that setup, where the
dark matter was taken to be a complex scalar, a number of nice features were
obtained such as $U(1)_D$ breaking by boundary conditions without the
introduction of a dark Higgs field, the absence of potentially troublesome SM
Higgs-dark singlet mixing, also by boundary conditions, the natural similarity
of the dark matter and dark photon masses and the decoupling of the heavy gauge
Kaluza-Klein states from the Standard Model. In the present paper we extend
this approach by examining the more complex cases of Dirac and Majorana
fermionic dark matter. In particular, we discuss a new mechanism that can occur
in 5-D (but not in 4-D) that allows for light Dirac dark matter in the $\sim
100$ MeV mass range, even though it has an $s$-wave annihilation into Standard
Model fields, by avoiding the strong constraints that arise from both the CMB
and 21 cm data. This mechanism makes use of the presence of the Kaluza-Klein
excitations of the dark photon to extremize the increase in the annihilation
cross section usually obtained via resonant enhancement. In the Majorana dark
matter case, we explore the possibility of a direct $s$-channel dark matter
pair-annihilation process producing the observed relic density, due to the
general presence of parity-violating dark matter interactions, without
employing the usual co-annihilation mechanism which is naturally suppressed in
this 5-D setup.

Bicca-Marques and Calegaro-Marques [2016] discussed the putative assumptions
related to an interpretation we provided regarding an observed positive
relationship between weekly averaged parasite richness of a group of mandrills
(Mandrillus sphinx) and their daily path lengths (DPL), published earlier in
the same journal (Brockmeyer et al., 2015). In our article, we proposed, inter
alia, that ""the daily travels of mandrills could be seen as a way to escape
contaminated habitats on a local scale"". In their article, Bicca-Marques and
Calegaro-Marques [2016] proposed an alternative mechanism that they considered
to be more parsimonious. In their view, increased DPL also increases exposure
to novel parasites from the environment. In other words, while we proposed that
elevated DPL may be a consequence of elevated parasite richness, they viewed it
as a cause. We are happy to see that our study attracted so much interest that
it evoked a public comment. We are also grateful to Bicca-Marques and
Calegaro-Marques [2016] for pointing out an obvious alternative scenario that
we failed to discuss and for laying out several key factors and assumptions
that should be addressed by future studies examining the links between parasite
risk and group ranging. We use this opportunity to advance this discourse by
responding to some of the criticisms raised in their discussion of our article.
In this reply, we briefly contextualize the main object of criticism. We then
discuss the putative parsimony of the two competing scenarios.

extremely good results for video human action classification, however, action

more elegant solution for action detection based on the recently developed
capsule network. We propose a 3D capsule network for videos, called
VideoCapsuleNet: a unified network for action detection which can jointly
perform pixel-wise action segmentation along with action classification. The
proposed network is a generalization of capsule network from 2D to 3D, which
takes a sequence of video frames as input. The 3D generalization drastically
increases the number of capsules in the network, making capsule routing
computationally expensive. We introduce capsule-pooling in the convolutional
capsule layer to address this issue which makes the voting algorithm tractable.
The routing-by-agreement in the network inherently models the action
representations and various action characteristics are captured by the
predicted capsules. This inspired us to utilize the capsules for action
localization and the class-specific capsules predicted by the network are used
to determine a pixel-wise localization of actions. The localization is further
improved by parameterized skip connections with the convolutional capsule
layers and the network is trained end-to-end with a classification as well as
localization loss. The proposed network achieves sate-of-the-art performance on
multiple action detection datasets including UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, and UCF-101

happens. To illustrate the new numerical approach, two helium isotopes $^3$He
and $^4$He were considered in two canonical problems, namely, heat transfer
between two planar surfaces and planar Couette flow. To solve these problems,
the ab initio potential for helium is used, but the proposed technique can be
used with any intermolecular potential. The problems were solved over the
temperature range from 1 K to 3000 K and for two values of the rarefaction
parameter 1 and 10. The former corresponds to the transitional regime and the
last describes the temperature jump and velocity slip regime. No influence of
the quantum effects was detected within the numerical error of 0.1 % for the
temperature 300 K and higher. However, the quantum approach requires less
computational effort than the classical one in this temperature range. For
temperatures lower than 300 K, the influence of the quantum effects exceed the
numerical error and reaches 67 % at the temperature of 1 K.

and hate attacks. Prior work has shown how these attacks often take place as a
result of ""raids,"" i.e., organized efforts by ad-hoc mobs coordinating from
third-party communities. Despite the increasing relevance of this phenomenon,
however, online services often lack effective countermeasures to mitigate it.
Unlike well-studied problems like spam and phishing, coordinated aggressive
behavior both targets and is perpetrated by humans, making defense mechanisms
that look for automated activity unsuitable. Therefore, the de-facto solution
is to reactively rely on user reports and human moderation.
  In this paper, we propose an automated solution to identify YouTube videos
that are likely to be targeted by coordinated harassers from fringe communities
like 4chan. First, we characterize and model YouTube videos along several axes
(metadata, audio transcripts, thumbnails) based on a ground truth dataset of
videos that were targeted by raids. Then, we use an ensemble of classifiers to
determine the likelihood that a video will be raided with very good results
(AUC up to 94%). Overall, our work provides an important first step towards
deploying proactive systems to detect and mitigate coordinated hate attacks on
platforms like YouTube.

makes the jointly trained CaptionBot and DrawingBot better than the separately

space for optimization as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries. Recently, the
high cost and resource limitations of Co have added a new design constraint and
high Ni-containing NMC alloys have gained enormous attention despite possible
performance trade-offs. It is not fully understood if this material space is a
disordered solid solution at room temperature and any arbitrary combination can
be used or if there exist distinct transition metal orderings to which
meta-stable solid solutions will decay during cycling and affect performance.
Here, we present a high fidelity computational search of the ternary phase
diagram with an emphasis on high-Ni, and thus low Co, containing compositional
phases to understand the room temperature stability of the ordered and
disordered solid solution phases. This is done through the use of density
functional theory training data fed into a reduced order model Hamiltonian that
accounts for effective electronic and spin interactions of neighboring
transition metal atoms at various lengths in a background of fixed composition
and position lithium and oxygen atoms. This model can then be solved to include
finite temperature thermodynamics into a convex hull analysis to understand the
regions of ordered and disordered solid solution as well the transition metal
orderings within the ordered region of the phase diagram. We find that for the
majority of transition metal compositions of the layered material, specifically
medium to high-Ni content, prefer transition metal ordering and predict the
collection of preferred compositions in the ordered region.

this problem.
  By the graph minor theorem, we get an analogous result for any minor-closed
property. Up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors, this resolves a conjecture of
Benjamini-Schramm-Shapira (STOC 2008) on the existence of one-sided property
testers for minor-closed properties. Furthermore, our algorithm is nearly
optimal, by an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound of Czumaj et al (RSA 2014).
  Prior to this work, the only graphs $H$ for which non-trivial one-sided
property testers were known for $H$-minor freeness are the following: $H$ being
a forest or a cycle (Czumaj et al, RSA 2014), $K_{2,k}$, $(k\times 2)$-grid,
and the $k$-circus (Fichtenberger et al, Arxiv 2017).

we derive a structure-aware probabilistic model incorporating a structure

when the squared temperature is larger than the magnetic field, a turnover

Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet

least 42% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or
more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au
could be as high as 100% depending on assumptions about the distribution of
single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the
habitable zone around sun-like stars of eta_earth=36+-14%. The innermost
planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10
days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be
explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary
systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than ~8%
and ~3% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus,
respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a
typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known
exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone
exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital
periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to
optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future

triples naturally yield heavy binary black holes with near-zero effective

produces a merger rate of between 2 and 25 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 in the local universe,
suggesting that the Lidov-Kozai mechanism can potentially explain all of the

cosmological predictions of the model in a wide range of the model parameters
including the effective interaction strength $G_X$, sterile neutrino mass
$m_{\rm st}$ and active-sterile mixings. With those we perform a statistical
analysis of the cosmological data from BBN, CMB, and BAO data to infer the
posterior probabilities of the sterile self-interaction model parameters. BBN
mostly provides information about the effective interaction strength and we
find that $\log_{10}(G_X/G_F)\geq 3.6$ can describe the primordial abundances
at 95% CL. Our analysis of CMB and BAO data show that when allowing a wide
prior for the sterile neutrino mass its posterior is bounded to $m_{\rm st}\leq
0.91~{\rm eV}$ (95% CL) considering CMB data only and $m_{\rm st}\leq 0.37~{\rm
eV}$ (95% CL) when adding the BAO information. So the mass bounds are slighly
relaxed compared with that of a non-interacting sterile neutrino model but a
sterile neutrino mass of 1 eV is still excluded at more than $2\sigma$ CL.
Conversely if fixing the sterile neutrino mass and mixing to the values
prefered by short baseline data we find that while that CMB data alone favors
the self-interacting scenario, including the BAO information severly degrades
the agreement with the model. Altogether we conclude then that adding the
self-interaction can alleviate the tension between eV sterile neutrinos and CMB
data, but when including also the BAO results the self-interacting sterile
neutrino model cannot lead to a satisfactory description of the data.

results when the error correction steps are performed noiselessly. Our examples
include the entire family of repetition codes, the 5-qubit, Steane, Shor, and
surface codes. When errors are measured in terms of the diamond norm, we find
that the error correction is typically much more effective for unitary errors
than for dephasing. We observe this behavior for a wide range of codes after a
single level of encoding, and in the thresholds of concatenated codes using
hard decoders. We show that this holds with great generality by proving a bound
on the performance of any stabilizer code when the noise at the physical level
is unitary. By comparing the diamond norm error $D'_\diamond$ of the logical
qubit with the same quantity at the physical level $D_\diamond$, we show that
$D'_\diamond \le c D^d_\diamond $ where $d$ is the distance of the code and $c$
is constant that depends on the code but not on the error. This bound compares
very favorably to the performance of error correction for dephasing noise and

exhibit a scaling $D'_\diamond \sim D_\diamond^{(d+1)/2}$.

are in mean motion resonance with Neptune. Many of these objects were likely
caught into resonances by planetary migration---either smooth or
stochastic---approximately 4 Gyr ago. Some, however, gravitationally scattered
off of Neptune and became transiently stuck in more recent events. Here, we use
numerical simulations to predict the number of transiently-stuck objects,
captured from the current actively scattering population, that occupy 111
resonances at semimajor axes $a=$30--100 au. Our source population is an
observationally constrained model of the currently-scattering TNOs. We predict
that, integrated across all resonances at these distances, the current
transient sticking population comprises 40\% of total
transiently-stuck+scattering TNOs, suggesting that these objects should be
treated as a single population. We compute the relative distribution of
transiently-stuck objects across all $p$:$q$ resonances with $1/6 \le q/p < 1$,
$p<40$, and $q<20$, providing predictions for the population of transient
objects with $H_r < 8.66$ in each resonance. We find that the relative
populations are approximately proportional to each resonance's libration period
and confirm that the importance of transient sticking increases with semimajor
axis in the studied range. We calculate the expected distribution of libration
amplitudes for stuck objects and demonstrate that observational constraints
indicate that both the total number and the amplitude-distribution of 5:2
resonant TNOs are inconsistent with a population dominated by transient
sticking from the current scattering disk. The 5:2 resonance hence poses a
challenge for leading theories of Kuiper belt sculpting.

this is a connect-the-dots introductory summary of Small Area Estimation, e.g.
small group prediction informed by a complex sampling design. While a
comprehensive book is (Rao and Molina 2015), the goal of this paper is to get
interested researchers up to speed with some current developments. We first
provide historical context of two kinds of regularization: 1) the
regularization 'within' the components of a predictor and 2) the regularization
'between' outcome and predictor. We focus on the MLM framework as it allows the
analyst to flexibly control the targets of the regularization. The flexible
control is useful when analysts want to overcome shortcomings in design-based
estimates. We'll describe the precision deficiencies (high variance) typical of
design-based estimates of small groups. We then highlight an interesting MLM
example from (Chaudhuri and Ghosh 2011) that integrates both kinds of
regularization (between and within). The key idea is to use the design-based
variance to control the amount of 'between' regularization and prior
information to regularize the components 'within' a predictor. The goal is to
let the design-based estimate have authority (when precise) but defer to a
model-based prediction when imprecise. We conclude by discussing optional
criteria to incorporate into a MLM prediction and possible entrypoints for
extensions.

substrate, inclined at a non-zero angle to the horizontal. Controls are applied
via same-fluid blowing and suction through the substrate surface. We consider
both overlying and hanging films, where the liquid lies above or below the
substrate, respectively. We study the weakly nonlinear evolution of the system,
which is governed by a forced Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation in two space
dimensions. The uncontrolled problem exhibits three ranges of dynamics
depending on the incline of the substrate: stable flat film solution, bounded
chaotic dynamics, or unbounded exponential growth of unstable transverse modes.
We proceed with the assumption that we may actuate at every point on the
substrate. The main focus is the optimal control problem, which we first study
in the special case that the forcing may only vary in the spanwise direction.
The structure of the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation allows the explicit
construction of optimal controls in this case using the classical theory of
linear quadratic regulators. Such controls are employed to prevent the
exponential growth of transverse waves in the case of a hanging film, revealing
complex dynamics for the streamwise and mixed modes. We then consider the
optimal control problem in full generality, and prove the existence of an
optimal control. For numerical simulations, we employ an iterative gradient
descent algorithm. In the final section, we consider the effects of transverse
mode forcing on the chaotic dynamics present in the streamwise and mixed modes
for the case of a vertical film flow. Coupling through nonlinearity allows us
to reduce the average energy in solutions without directly forcing the linearly
unstable dominant modes.

from the first principles. Employing the density functional theory calculations
with hybrid functional, the quadratic vibronic coupling constants of C$_{60}^-$
were derived. The warping of the adiabatic potential energy surface of
C$_{60}^-$ by the quadratic vibronic coupling is estimated about 2 meV, which
is much smaller than the Jahn-Teller stabilization energy ($\approx$ 50 meV).
Because of the selection rule and the vibronic reduction, the quadratic
coupling slightly modifies the vibronic states of C$_{60}$ anions.
Particularly, in the case of C$_{60}^{3-}$, parity and symmetry selection rule
significantly reduces the effect of quadratic coupling on vibronic states. The
present results confirm that the low-energy vibronic dynamics of C$_{60}^{n-}$
is of pseudorotational type.

search for radio pulsars yet conducted, is ongoing at the Arecibo Observatory
in Puerto Rico. The vast majority of the 180 pulsars discovered by PALFA have
spin periods shorter than 2 seconds. Pulsar surveys may miss long-period radio
pulsars due to the summing of a finite number of harmonic components in
conventional Fourier analyses (typically $\sim$16), or due to the strong effect
of red noise at low modulation frequencies. We address this reduction in
sensitivity by using a time-domain search technique: the Fast-Folding Algorithm
(FFA). We designed a program that implements a FFA-based search in the PALFA
processing pipeline, and tested the efficiency of the algorithm by performing
tests under both ideal, white noise conditions, as well as with real PALFA
observational data. In the two scenarios, we show that the time-domain
algorithm has the ability to outperform the FFT-based periodicity search
implemented in the survey. We perform simulations to compare the previously
reported PALFA sensitivity with that obtained using our new FFA implementation.
These simulations show that for a pulsar having a pulse duty cycle of roughly
3%, the performance of our FFA pipeline exceeds that of our FFT pipeline for
pulses with DM $\lesssim$ 40 pc cm$^{-3}$ and for periods as short as $\sim$500
ms, and that the survey sensitivity is improved by at least a factor of two for
periods $\gtrsim$ 6 sec. Discoveries from the implementation of the algorithm
in PALFA are also presented in this paper.

stable IDE models. Subsequently, we derive robust and accurate constraints on

mild preference for the DE fluid residing in the phantom region ($w_x<-1$),
with significance up to 95\% confidence level, while we obtain new upper limits
on the coupling parameter between the dark components. The preference for a
phantom DE suggests a coupling function $Q<0$, thus a scenario where energy
flows from the DE to the DM. We also examine the possibility of addressing the

that of a standard giant molecular cloud, the cloud's virial ratio of ~1.8 is

extinction threshold, molecular clouds in metal-poor regions should have high

algorithms. In the landscape of real-time heuristics search research, it is not
rare to find that an algorithm X that appears to perform better than algorithm
Y on a group of problems, performed worse than Y for another group of problems.
If these published algorithms are combined to generate a more powerful space of
algorithms, then that novel space of algorithms may solve a distribution of
problems more efficiently. Based on this intuition, a recent work Bulitko 2016
has defined the task of finding a combination of heuristics search algorithms

defined over a set of building blocks published algorithms and a simulated

  In this paper, we extend the set of building blocks by adding one published

operators do not carry information on the global shape of the intertwiners.
Here we introduce dual multipole moments for continuous and discrete surfaces,

RFIs from the Earth. The satellites can make observations on the far side of
the Moon and then send back the data on the near side part of the orbit.
However, for such array the traditional imaging algorithm is not applicable:
the field of view is very wide (almost whole sky), and for baselines
distributed on a plane, there is a mirror symmetry between the two sides of the

in the oxygen square sub-lattices formed by the alternate hybridization of
$p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals with the $3d$ copper orbitals, provides an unified
explanation for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry of both the SC and PG order
parameters. Attractive and repulsive interactions involve holes of the two
different sublattices and can be derived from the spin-fermion model. Optimal
doping occurs when the chemical potential vanishes. For $N$-layered cuprates,
the growth of the optimal temperature with $N$, as well as the trend of the SC
and AF domes to superimpose, can be simply understood. Our results for the
optimal SC transition temperature are in excellent agreement with the
experiments for $N=2$ materials of the $Bi$ and $Hg$ families. For $N=3$ the
agreement is still satisfactory, while for $N>3$, it becomes poor. The
explanation for these facts allows us to suggest a method for increasing the
critical SC temperature in cuprates.

cosmological 21cm experiments, both the astrophysical foregrounds and the
receiver noise are typically several orders of magnitude greater than the 21cm
signal. However, the different properties of the 21cm signal, foreground, and
noise can be exploited to separate these components. The foregrounds are
generally smooth or correlated over the frequency space along a line of sight
(l.o.s.), while both the 21cm signal and the noise varies stochastically along
the same l.o.s. The foreground can be removed by filtering out the smooth
component in the frequency space. The receiver noise is basically uncorrelated
for observations at different times, hence for surveys they are also
uncorrelated in the different directions, while the 21cm signal which traces
the large scale structure are correlated up to certain scales. In this
exercise, we apply Wiener filters in frequency and angular space, to extract
the 21cm signals. We found that the method works well. The inaccurate knowledge

inappropriate selection can lead to the loss of information of the input during
forward propagation and the exponential vanishing/exploding of gradients during
back-propagation. Understanding the theoretical properties of untrained random
networks is key to identifying which deep networks may be trained successfully
as recently demonstrated by Schoenholz et al. (2017) who showed that for deep
feedforward neural networks only a specific choice of hyperparameters known as
the `edge of chaos' can lead to good performance. We complete this analysis by
providing quantitative results showing that, for a class of ReLU-like
activation functions, the information propagates indeed deeper for an
initialization at the edge of chaos. By further extending this analysis, we
identify a class of activation functions that improve the information
propagation over ReLU-like functions. This class includes the Swish activation,
$\phi_{swish}(x) = x \cdot \text{sigmoid}(x)$, used in Hendrycks & Gimpel
(2016), Elfwing et al. (2017) and Ramachandran et al. (2017). This provides a
theoretical grounding for the excellent empirical performance of $\phi_{swish}$
observed in these contributions. We complement those previous results by
illustrating the benefit of using a random initialization on the edge of chaos

variable multi-pole line cusp magnetic field (VMMF). The VMMF has been produced
by placing six electromagnets (with embedded profiled vacoflux-50 core) over a
large cylindrical volume (1 m axial length and 40 cm diameter). The magnetic
field have been measured by hall probe method and compared with simulated
magnetic field by performing simulation using FEMM tools. Results from magnetic
field simulation indicate that the rate of change of pole magnetic field
(maximum magnetic field) with respect to magnet current for vacoflux-50 core is
high (7.53 G/A) as compared to the simple air core electromagnet (2.15 G/A).
The area of the nearly field free region (null region) in the chamber volume
can be controlled without changing a number of pole magnets. From the
experimental results, it has been observed that in this field configuration the
confinement of the primary electrons increases and leak width of plasma
decreases with increasing the magnetic field. Thus the mean density, particle
confinement time and the stability of the plasma increase with increasing
magnetic field. In addition to this, it has been found that the radial
uniformity of the plasma density explicitly depends on the VMMF. It is also
shown that the VMMF controls the scavenging of confined primary electrons and
confinement of primary electron increased with magnetic field which helps to
boost up the plasma density.

strategic interaction (e.g., bargaining, oligopolistic entry, peer effects). We
consider a model where agents play a discrete game with complete information
whose equilibrium actions (i.e., binary treatments) determine a post-game
outcome in a nonseparable model with endogeneity. Due to the simultaneity in
the first stage, the model as a whole is incomplete and the selection process
fails to exhibit the conventional monotonicity. Without imposing parametric
restrictions or large support assumptions, this poses challenges in recovering
treatment parameters. To address these challenges, we first establish a
monotonic pattern of the equilibria in the first-stage game in terms of the
number of treatments selected. Based on this finding, we derive bounds on the
average treatment effects (ATEs) under nonparametric shape restrictions and the
existence of excluded exogenous variables. We show that instrument variation

16 in the Tarantula Nebula as a runaway star based on its peculiar
line-of-sight velocity. We use the Gaia DR2 catalog to measure the relative
proper motion of VFTS 16 and nearby bright stars to test if this star might
have been ejected from the central cluster, R136, via dynamical ejection. We
find that the position angle and magnitude of the relative proper motion (0.338
+/- 0.046 mas/yr, or approximately 80 +\- 11 km/s) of VFTS 16 are consistent
with ejection from R136 approximately 1.5 +/- 0.2 Myr ago, very soon after the
cluster was formed. There is some tension with the presumed age of VFTS 16
that, from published stellar parameters, cannot be greater than 0.9 +0.3/-0.2
Myr. Older ages for this star would appear to be prohibited due to the absence
of He I lines in its optical spectrum, since this sets a firm lower limit on
its effective temperature. The dynamical constraints may imply an unusual
evolutionary history for this object, perhaps indicating it is a merger
product. Gaia DR2 also confirms that another very massive star in the Tarantula
Nebula, VFTS 72 (alias BI253; O2 III-V(n)((f*)), is also a runaway on the basis
of its proper motion as measured by Gaia. While its tangential proper motion
(0.392 +/-0.062 mas/yr or 93 +/-15 km/s) would be consistent with dynamical
ejection from R136 approximately 1 Myr ago, its position angle is discrepant
with this direction at the 2$\sigma$ level. From their Gaia DR2 proper motions
we conclude that the two ~100 solar mass O2 stars, VFTS 16 and VFTS72, are fast
runaway stars, with space velocities of around 100 km/s relative to R136 and
the local massive star population. The dynamics of VFTS16 are consistent with
it having been ejected from R136, and this star therefore sets a robust lower
limit on the age of the central cluster of ~1.3 Myr.

fluctuations, the origin of those fluctuations was unknown. Analysis of the
striae of the intensity variation in the dynamic spectrum allowed us to reveal
two quasi-oscillatory components. The shorter component has the apparent
wavelength of $\sim2$ Mm, phase speed of $\sim657$ km s$^{-1}$, which gives the
oscillation period of $\sim3$ s, and the relative amplitude of $\sim0.35$%. The
longer component has the wavelength of $\sim12$ Mm, and relative amplitude of
$\sim5.1$%. The short frequency range of the detection does not allow us to
estimate its phase speed. However, the properties of the shorter oscillatory
component allowed us to interpret it as a fast magnetoacoustic wave guided by a
plasma non-uniformity along the magnetic field outwards from the Sun. The
assumption that the intensity of the radio emission is proportional to the
amount of plasma in the emitting volume allowed us to show that the
superposition of the plasma density modulation by a fast wave and a
longer-wavelength oscillation of an unspecified nature could readily reproduce
the fine structure of the observed dynamic spectrum. The observed parameters of
the fast wave give the absolute value of the magnetic field in the emitting

clock drift, which occurs at a slower time scale. We study the zero-error
capacity under both types of timing imperfections, and obtain optimal
zero-error codes for some cases. Our results show that, as opposed to common

learn and track the clock frequency at the receiver; rather, one can design
codes that come close to the performance of perfectly synchronous communication
systems without any clock synchronization at the receiver.

calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our results show
that the density of states at the Fermi energy is mainly composed by V--$d$

clusters over time, allowing one to track the growth and death of communities
as the network evolves. However, modularity maximization, a popular method for
performing multilayer community detection, requires the specification of an
appropriate null model as well as resolution and interlayer coupling
parameters. Importantly, the ability of the algorithm to accurately detect
community evolution is dependent on the choice of these parameters. In
functional temporal networks, where evolving communities reflect changing
functional relationships between network nodes, it is especially important that
the detected communities reflect any state changes of the system. Here, we
present analytical work suggesting that a uniform null model provides improved
sensitivity to the detection of small evolving communities in temporal
correlation networks. We then propose a method for increasing the sensitivity
of modularity maximization to state changes in nodal dynamics by modeling
self-identity links between layers based on the self-similarity of the network
nodes between layers. This method is more appropriate for functional temporal
networks from both a modeling and mathematical perspective, as it incorporates
the dynamic nature of network nodes. We motivate our method based on
applications in neuroscience where network nodes represent neurons and
functional edges represent similarity of firing patterns in time. Finally, we
show that in simulated data sets of neuronal spike trains, updating interlayer
links based on the firing properties of the neurons provides superior community
detection of evolving network structure when group of neurons change their
firing properties over time.

energy efficiency over the traditional load/store devices currently employed in

languages such as C++ and OpenCL has greatly increased programmer productivity
when designing for such platforms. While this has enabled a wider audience to
target spatial computing architectures, the optimization principles known from
traditional software design are no longer sufficient to implement
high-performance codes, due to fundamentally distinct aspects of hardware
design, such as programming for deep pipelines, distributed memory resources,
and scalable routing. To alleviate this, we present a collection of optimizing
transformations for HLS, targeting scalable and efficient architectures for
high-performance computing (HPC) applications. We systematically identify
classes of transformations (pipelining, scalability, and memory), the
characteristics of their effect on the HLS code and the resulting hardware
(e.g., increasing data reuse or resource consumption), and the objectives that
each transformation can target (e.g., resolve interface contention, or increase
parallelism). We show how these can be used to efficiently exploit pipelining,
on-chip distributed fast memory, and on-chip dataflow, allowing for massively
parallel architectures. To quantify the effect of various transformations, we
cover the optimization process of a sample set of HPC kernels, provided as open

performance engineers and compiler engineers in tapping into the performance
potential offered by spatial computing architectures using HLS.

parameters but that the correspondence has not been tested. Here, we show that
it is simple and computationally feasible to calculate distances between
functions in a $L^2$ Hilbert space. We examine how typical networks behave in
this space, and compare how parameter $\ell^2$ distances compare to function
$L^2$ distances between various points of an optimization trajectory. We find
that the two distances are nontrivially related. In particular, the
$L^2/\ell^2$ ratio decreases throughout optimization, reaching a steady value
around when test error plateaus. We then investigate how the $L^2$ distance
could be applied directly to optimization. We first propose that in multitask
learning, one can avoid catastrophic forgetting by directly limiting how much
the input/output function changes between tasks. Secondly, we propose a new
learning rule that constrains the distance a network can travel through
$L^2$-space in any one update. This allows new examples to be learned in a way
that minimally interferes with what has previously been learned. These
applications demonstrate how one can measure and regularize function distances
directly, without relying on parameters or local approximations like loss

diagrams, and bond graphs. A prop is a strict symmetric monoidal category where
the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by
addition. In this approach, electrical circuits make up the morphisms in a
prop, as do signal-flow diagrams, and bond graphs. A network, such as an
electrical circuit, with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to
$n$, while putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them
side by side is tensoring. Here we work out the details of this approach for
various kinds of electrical circuits, then signal-flow diagrams, and then bond
graphs. Each kind of network corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We
also describe the ""behavior"" of electrical circuits, bond graphs, and
signal-flow diagrams using morphisms between props. To assign a behavior to a
network we ""black box"" the network, which forgets its inner workings and
records only the relation it imposes between inputs and outputs. The process of
black-boxing a network then corresponds to a morphism between props.
Interestingly, there are two different behaviors for any bond graph, related by
a natural transformation. To achieve all of this we first prove some
foundational results about props. These results let us describe any prop in
terms of generators and equations, and also define morphisms of props by naming
where the generators go and checking that relevant equations hold. Technically,
the key tools are the Rosebrugh--Sabadini--Walters result relating circuits to
special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and
signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are
equivalent to props.

of BH growth occurs within $\sim$$L_{*}$ galaxies, embedded between two
regulatory states of the galaxy host: in sub $L_{*}$ galaxies efficient stellar
feedback regulates the gas inflow onto the galaxy and significantly reduces the
growth of the central BH, while in galaxies more massive than $L_{*}$ efficient
AGN feedback regulates the gas inflow onto the galaxy and curbs further
non-linear BH growth. We find evolving critical galaxy and halo mass scales at
which rapid BH growth begins. Galaxies in the low-redshift Universe transition
into the rapid BH growth phase in haloes that are approximately an order of
magnitude more massive than their high-redshift counterparts (\M{200} $\approx
10^{12.4}$~\Msol at $z \approx 0$ decreasing to \M{200} $\approx
10^{11.2}$~\Msol at $z \approx 6$). Instead, BHs enter the rapid growth phase
at a fixed critical halo virial temperature ($T_{\mathrm{vir}} \approx
10^{5.6}$~K). We additionally show that major galaxy--galaxy interactions ($\mu
\geq \frac{1}{4}$, where $\mu$ is the stellar mass ratio) play a substantial
role in triggering the rapid growth phase of BHs in the low-redshift Universe,
whilst potentially having a lower influence at high redshift. Approximately
40\% of BHs that initiate the rapid BH growth phase at $z \approx 0$ do so
within $\pm 0.5$ dynamical times of a major galaxy--galaxy merger, a fourfold
increase above what is expected from the background merger rate. We find that
minor mergers ($\frac{1}{10} \leq \mu < \frac{1}{4}$) have a substantially
lower influence in triggering the rapid growth phase at all epochs.

Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design

In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in
that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL
algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest
numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems
such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level
controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed
automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we
propose to use off-policy experience for both higher and lower-level training.
This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors
change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an
off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take
advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher-
and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions
than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that
it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show
that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots,
such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations, learning
from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time

However, simulations with large parameter spaces suffer from inverse problem
instabilities, where similar simulated outputs can map back to very different
sets of input parameters. While of fundamental importance, such instabilities
are seldom resolved due to the intractably large number of simulations required
to comprehensively explore parameter space. Here we show how Bayesian machine
learning can be used to address inverse problem instabilities, and apply it to
two popular experimental diagnostics in plasma physics. We find that the
extraction of information from measurements simply on the basis of agreement
with simulations is unreliable, and leads to a significant underestimation of
uncertainties. We describe how to statistically quantify the effect of unstable
inverse models, and describe an approach to experimental design that mitigates
its impact.

and coined the shift from a more design-science-driven engineering discipline
to an insight-oriented, and theory-centric one. Yet, we still face many
challenges, among which some increase the need for interdisciplinary research.
This is especially true for the investigation of human-centric aspects of
software engineering. Although we can already observe an increased recognition
of the need for more interdisciplinary research in (empirical) software
engineering, such research configurations come with challenges barely discussed
from a scientific point of view. In this position paper, we critically reflect
upon the epistemological setting of empirical software engineering and
elaborate its configuration as an Interdiscipline. In particular, we (1)
elaborate a pragmatic view on empirical research for software engineering
reflecting a cyclic process for knowledge creation, (2) motivate a path towards
symmetrical interdisciplinary research, and (3) adopt five rules of thumb from
other interdisciplinary collaborations in our field before concluding with new
emerging challenges. This shall support stopping to treating empirical software
engineering as a developing discipline moving towards a paradigmatic stage of
normal science, but as a configuration of symmetric interdisciplinary teams and

with chondrules whose radii are between 500 and 1000 $\mu$m, in 100-$\mu$m
increments. The collisions are driven by Brownian motion and solar nebula
turbulence. After each collision, the colliding particles either stick at the
point of contact, roll or bounce. We limit accretion of dust monomers (and in
some cases, dust aggregates) to a small patch of the chondrule surface, for
computational expediency. We model the morphology of the dust rim and the
trajectory of the dust particle, which are not considered in most of the
previous works. Radial profiles of FGR porosity show that rims formed in weak
turbulence are more porous (with a porosity of 60-74\%) than rims formed in
stronger turbulence (with a porosity of 52-60\%). The lower end of each range
corresponds to large chondrules and the upper end to small chondrules, meaning
that the chondrule size also has an impact on FGR porosity. The thickness of
FGRs depends linearly on chondrule radius, and the slope of this linear
dependency increases with time, and decreases with the turbulence strength. The
porosity of FGRs formed by dust aggregates is $\sim 20\%$ on average greater
than that of FGRs formed by single monomers. In general, the relatively high
porosities that we obtain are consistent with those calculated by previous

existing approaches for teaching multiple concepts are typically based on
heuristic scheduling techniques without theoretical guarantees. In this paper,
we look at the problem from the perspective of discrete optimization and
introduce a novel algorithmic framework for teaching multiple concepts with
strong performance guarantees. Our framework is both generic, allowing the
design of teaching schedules for different memory models, and also interactive,
allowing the teacher to adapt the schedule to the underlying forgetting
mechanisms of the learner. Furthermore, for a well-known memory model, we are
able to identify a regime of model parameters where our framework is guaranteed
to achieve high performance. We perform extensive evaluations using simulations
along with real user studies in two concrete applications: (i) an educational
app for online vocabulary teaching; and (ii) an app for teaching novices how to
recognize animal species from images. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm compared to popular heuristic approaches.

that are occluded by other objects do not generate measurements. In
measurement-wise occlusion, a previously unstudied approach, all objects may
generate measurements but some measurements may be occluded by others. While
the relative validity of each abstraction depends on the situation and sensor,
measurement-wise occlusion fits into probabilistic multi-object tracking

wind nebulae (PWNe) with the ordered magnetic field, the observed slow
expansion $v_{\rm PWN} \ll c$ requires the wind to be dominated by kinetic
energy at the upstream of its termination shock, which conflicts with the
pulsar wind theory ($\sigma$-problem). In this paper, we extend the standard
model of PWNe by phenomenologically taking into account conversion of the
ordered to turbulent magnetic field and dissipation of the turbulent magnetic
field. Disordering of the magnetic structure is inferred from the recent
three-dimensional relativistic ideal MHD simulations, while magnetic
dissipation is a non-ideal MHD effect requiring a finite resistivity. We apply
this model to the Crab Nebula and find that the conversion effect is important
for the flow deceleration, while the dissipation effect is not. Even for
Poynting-dominated pulsar wind, we obtain the Crab Nebula's $v_{\rm PWN}$ by
adopting a finite conversion time-scale of $\sim 0.3$ yr. Magnetic dissipation
primarily affects the synchrotron radiation properties. Any values of the
pulsar wind magnetization $\sigma_{\rm w}$ are allowed within the present model
of the PWN dynamics alone, and even a small termination shock radius of $\ll
0.1$ pc reproduces the observed dynamical features of the Crab Nebula. In order
to establish a high-$\sigma_{\rm w}$ model of PWNe, it is important to extend
the present model by taking into account the broadband spectrum and its spacial
profiles.

using the K giant stars with [Fe/H]$<-1$ dex within 4 kpc from the Sun. By
fitting the rotational velocity distribution with three Gaussian components,
stellar halo, disk, and a counter-rotating hot population, we find that the
local halo progradely rotates with $V_T=+27^{+4}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$ providing
the local standard of rest velocity of $V_{LSR}=232$ km s$^{-1}$. Meanwhile, we
obtain the dispersion of rotational velocity is $\sigma_{T}=72^{+4}_{-4}$ km
s$^{-1}$. Although the rotational velocity strongly depends on the choice of
$V_{LSR}$, the trend of prograde rotation is substantial even when $V_{LSR}$ is
set at as low as 220 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we derive the rotation for
subsamples with different metallicities and find that the rotational velocity
is essentially not correlated with [Fe/H]. This may hint a secular evolution
origin of the prograde rotation. It shows that the metallicity of the
progradely rotating halo is peaked within -1.9$<$[Fe/H]$<$-1.6 without

counter-rotating stars with larger dispersion and lower metallicity. Finally,
the disk component rotates with $V_T=+182^{+6}_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$ and

automatically adjust with the number of stragglers in the system. We show that

finding their ways in emerging cloud infrastructure. Similar trend is happening
for main memory subsystem, as advanced DRAM technologies with higher capacity,
frequency and number of channels are deploying for cloud-scale solutions
specially for non-virtualized environment where cloud subscribers can exactly
specify the configuration of underling hardware. Given the performance
sensitivity of standard workloads to the memory hierarchy parameters, it is
important to understand the role of memory and storage for data intensive
workloads. In this paper, we investigate how the choice of DRAM (high-end vs
low-end) impacts the performance of Hadoop, Spark, and MPI based Big Data
workloads in the presence of different storage types on bare metal cloud.
Through a methodical experimental setup, we have analyzed the impact of DRAM
capacity, operating frequency, the number of channels, storage type, and
scale-out factors on the performance of these popular frameworks. Based on
micro-architectural analysis, we classified data-intensive workloads into three
groups namely I/O bound, compute bound, and memory bound. The characterization
results show that neither DRAM capacity, frequency, nor the number of channels
play a significant role on the performance of all studied Hadoop workloads as
they are mostly I/O bound. On the other hand, our results reveal that iterative
tasks (e.g. machine learning) in Spark and MPI are benefiting from a high-end
DRAM in particular high frequency and large number of channels, as they are
memory or compute bound. Our results show that using SSD PCIe cannot shift the
bottleneck from storage to memory, while it can change the workload behavior
from I/O bound to compute bound.

trained on the unit sphere, as opposed to the entire space, and the threshold
can be trained in a bounded interval, as opposed to the real line. We show that
the NNs in the reduced parameter space are mathematically equivalent to the
standard NNs with parameters in the whole space. The reduced parameter space
shall facilitate the optimization procedure for the network training, as the

using $k$-nearest neighbor distances is proposed, where the functional under
consideration is in the form of the expectation of some function $f$ of the

unbiased, using the convergence of the normalized volume of a $k$-nearest
neighbor ball to a Gamma distribution in the large-sample limit, and naturally
involves the inverse Laplace transform of a scaled version of the function $f.$
Some instantiations of the proposed estimator recover existing $k$-nearest

Kullback--Leibler and R\'enyi divergences, and discover new consistent
estimators for many other functionals such as logarithmic entropies and

a broad class of densities for general functionals, and the convergence rate in
mean squared error is established as a function of the sample size for smooth,
bounded densities.

measuring the quality of the training process converge to a deterministic
process characterized by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), whereas the
microscopic states containing all the detailed weights remain stochastic, whose
dynamics can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). This
analysis provides a new perspective different from recent analyses in the limit
of small learning rate, where the microscopic state is always considered
deterministic, and the contribution of noise is ignored. From our analysis, we
show that the level of the background noise is essential to the convergence of
the training process: setting the noise level too strong leads to failure of
feature recovery, whereas setting the noise too weak causes oscillation.

are in contact with each other. This implies that they share a common envelope
of gas. In this work we seek signatures of nonlinearity and chaos in these
stars by using time series analysis techniques. We use three main techniques,
namely the correlation dimension,f (\alpha) spectrum and the bicoherence. The
former two are calculated from the reconstructed dynamics, while the latter is
calculated from the Fourier transforms of the time series of intensity
variations(light curves) of these stars. Our dataset consists of data from 463
overcontact binary stars in the Kepler field of view [1]. Our analysis
indicates nonlinearity and signatures of chaos in almost all the light curves.
We also explore whether the underlying nonlinear properties of the stars are
related to their physical properties like fill-out-factor, a measure of the
extend of contact between the components of an overcontact binary system . We
observe that significant correlations exist between the fill out factor and the
nonlinear quantifiers. This correlation is more pronounced in specific
subcategories constructed based on the mass ratios and effective temperatures
of the binaries. The correlations observed can be indicative of variations in
the nonlinear properties of the star as it ages. We believe that this study
relating nonlinear and astrophysical properties of binary stars is the first of
its kind and is an important starting point for such studies in other
astrophysical objects displaying nonlinear dynamical behaviour.

restaurant domain utterances whose style varies according to models of
personality, giving us total control over both the semantic content and the
stylistic variation in the training data. We then vary the amount of explicit
stylistic supervision given to the three models. We show that our most explicit
model can simultaneously achieve high fidelity to both semantic and stylistic
goals: this model adds a context vector of 36 stylistic parameters as input to
the hidden state of the encoder at each time step, showing the benefits of
explicit stylistic supervision, even when the amount of training data is large.

(e.g., hotspots) for servicing their demands locally. How to dynamically
determine a UAV swarm's cooperative path planning to best meet many users'
spatio-temporally distributed demands is an important question but is
unaddressed in the literature. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first
to design and analyze cooperative path planning algorithms of a large UAV swarm
for optimally servicing many spatial locations, where ground users' demands are
released dynamically in the long time horizon. Regarding a single UAV's path
planning design, we manage to substantially simplify the traditional dynamic
program and propose an optimal algorithm of low computation complexity, which
is only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of spatial locations and
user demands. After coordinating a large number $K$ of UAVs, this simplified
dynamic optimization problem becomes intractable and we alternatively present a
fast iterative cooperation algorithm with provable approximation ratio
$1-(1-\frac{1}{K})^{K}$ in the worst case, which is proved to obviously
outperform the traditional approach of partitioning UAVs to serve different
location clusters separately. To relax UAVs' battery capacity limit for
sustainable service provisioning, we further allow UAVs to travel to charging
stations in the mean time and thus jointly design UAVs' path planning over
users' locations and charging stations. Despite of the problem difficulty, for
the optimal solution, we successfully transform the problem to an integer
linear program by creating novel directed acyclic graph of the UAV-state
transition diagram, and propose an iterative algorithm with constant
approximation ratio.

on top of a computing cluster, those platforms utilize scheduling algorithms to
allocate resources. An efficient scheduler is crucial to the system performance
due to limited resources, e.g. CPU and Memory, and a large number of user

and incoming jobs' resource demands, which make assigning resources a
challenging task. If most of the resources are occupied by a long-running job,
other jobs will have to keep waiting until it releases them. This paper
presents a new scheduling strategy, named DRESS that particularly aims to
optimize the allocation among jobs with various demands. Specifically, it
classifies the jobs into two categories based on their requests, reserves a

massless scalar field in 3+1 dimensions. The goal is to model the breakdown of
correlations that has been proposed to occur at the horizon of an evaporating
black hole. We do this by introducing at fixed radius $r=a$ a one parameter
family of self-adjoint extensions of the three dimensional Laplacian operator
that interpolate between the condition that the values and the derivatives on
the two sides of $r=a$ coincide for $t\le0$ (no wall) and the two-sided
Dirichlet boundary condition for $t \ge 1/\lambda$ (fully-developed wall).
Creation of the shell produces null, spherical pulses of energy on either side
of the shell, one ingoing and the other outgoing. The renormalized energy
density $\langle T_{00}\rangle$ diverges to positive infinity in the outgoing
energy pulse, just outside the light cone of the fully-formed wall at
$t=1/\lambda$. Unlike in the 3+1 point source creation, there is no persistent
memory cloud of energy. As in the creation of a 1+1 dimensional wall, the
response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector in the post-shell region is independent of
the time scale for shell formation and is finite. The latter property casts
doubt on the efficacy of this mechanism for firewall creation.

their implementation of specialized algorithms for closed-loop tone tracking,
which consists of fast feedback and feedforward to each resonator's excitation
parameters based on transmission measurements. Closed-loop tone tracking
enables improved system linearity, a significant increase in sensor count per
readout line, and the possibility of overcoupled resonator designs for enhanced
dynamic range. Low-bandwidth prototype electronics were used to demonstrate
closed-loop tone tracking on twelve 300-kHz-wide microwave SQUID resonators,
spaced at $\sim$6 MHz with center frequencies $\sim$5-6 GHz. We achieve
multi-kHz tracking bandwidth and demonstrate that the noise floor of the

difference between trajectories extracted from experiment and simulated
trajectories based on many-particle force fields. The force fields include both
Coulombic interactions and dielectric polarization effects that arise due to
particle-particle charge mismatch and particle-environment dielectric contrast.
The strategy was applied to systems of free falling charged granular particles
in vacuum, where electrostatic interactions are the only driving forces that
influence the particles' motion. We show that when the particles' initial
positions and velocities are known, the optimizer requires only an initial and
final particle configuration of a short trajectory in order to accurately infer
the particles' charges; when the initial velocities are unknown and only the
initial positions are given, the optimizer can learn from multiple frames along
the trajectory to determine the particles' initial velocities and charges.
While the results presented here offer a proof-of-concept demonstration of the
proposed ideas, the proposed strategy could be extended to more complex systems
of electrostatically charged granular matter.

In addition, with the increasing number of in-the-wild aging data, the

joint optimization of age estimation algorithm and deep learning system.
Cooperated with the city surveillance network, this system can provide age

computing architecture including an edge, a fog and a cloud layer, which
directly processes age estimation from raw videos. Second, we optimize the age
estimation algorithm based on CNNs with label distribution and K-L divergence
distance embedded in the fog layer and evaluate the model on the latest wild

the demographics data dynamically at far-distance without contact, and makes
the city population analysis automatically; and 2. the age model training has
been speed-up without losing training progress or model quality. To our best
knowledge, this is the first intelligent demographics system which has
potential applications in improving the efficiency of smart cities and urban

$L^2$-Wasserstein metric tensor in the probability density space to a parameter
space, equipping the latter with a positive definite metric tensor, under which
it becomes a Riemannian manifold, named the Wasserstein statistical manifold.
In general, it is not a totally geodesic sub-manifold of the density space, and
therefore its geodesics will differ from the Wasserstein geodesics, except for
the well-known Gaussian distribution case, a fact which can also be validated
under our framework. We use the sub-manifold geometry to derive a gradient flow
and natural gradient descent method in the parameter space. When parametrized
densities lie in $\bR$, the induced metric tensor establishes an explicit
formula. In optimization problems, we observe that the natural gradient descent
outperforms the standard gradient descent when the Wasserstein distance is the

packings of arborescences and branchings. We first prove that the minimum-cost
packings of disjoint $k$ branchings (minimum-cost $k$-branchings) induce an
$\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convex function defined on the integer vectors on the
vertex set. The proof is based on a theorem on packing disjoint $k$-branchings,
which extends Edmonds' disjoint branchings theorem and is of independent
interest. We then show the $\mathrm{M}$-convexity of the minimum-cost
$k$-arborescences, which provides a short proof for a theorem of Bern\'ath and
Kir\'aly (SODA 2016) stating that the root vectors of the minimum-cost
$k$-arborescences form a base polyhedron of a submodular function. Finally,
building upon the $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convexity of $k$-branchings, we present
a new problem of minimum-cost root location of a $k$-branching, and show that
it can be solved in polynomial time if the opening cost function is
$\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convex.

that were computed with the MURaM radiative MHD code. We focus the analysis on
newly forming downflow lanes in exploding granules since they show how weakly
magnetized regions in the photosphere (center of granules) evolve into strongly
magnetized regions (downflow lanes). We find that newly formed downflow lanes
exhibit initially mostly a laminar converging flow that amplifies the vertical
magnetic field embedded in the granule from a few 10 G to field strengths
exceeding 800 G. This results in extended magnetic sheets that have a length
comparable to granular scales. Field amplification by turbulent shear happens
first a few 100 km beneath the visible layers of the photosphere. Shallow
recirculation transports the resulting turbulent field into the photosphere
within minutes, after which the newly formed downflow lane shows a mix of
strong magnetic sheets and turbulent field components. We stress in particular
the role of shallow and deep recirculation for the organization and strength of
magnetic field in the photosphere and discuss the photospheric and
sub-photospheric energy conversion associated with the small-scale dynamo
process. While the energy conversion through the Lorentz force depends only
weakly on the saturation field strength (and therefore deep or shallow
recirculation), it is strongly dependent on the magnetic Prandtl number. We
discuss the potential of these findings for further constraining small-scale
dynamo models through high resolution observations.

most effective solution. Cryptographic key is an important entity in this
procedure. In general, randomly generated cryptographic key (of 256 bits) is
difficult to remember. However, such a key needs to be stored in a protected
place or transported through a shared communication line which, in fact, poses
another threat to security. As an alternative, researchers advocate the
generation of cryptographic key using the biometric traits of both sender and
receiver during the sessions of communication, thus avoiding key storing and at
the same time without compromising the strength in security. Nevertheless, the
biometric-based cryptographic key generation possesses few concerns such as
privacy of biometrics, sharing of biometric data between both communicating
users (i.e., sender and receiver), and generating revocable key from
irrevocable biometric. This work addresses the above-mentioned concerns.
  In this work, a framework for secure communication between two users using
fingerprint based crypto-biometric system has been proposed. For this,
Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm is used to generate public keys from private keys
of both sender and receiver which are shared and further used to produce a
symmetric cryptographic key at both ends. In this approach, revocable key for
symmetric cryptography is generated from irrevocable fingerprint. The biometric
data is neither stored nor shared which ensures the security of biometric data,
and perfect forward secrecy is achieved using session keys. This work also
ensures the long-term security of messages communicated between two users.
Based on the experimental evaluation over four datasets of FVC2002 and NIST

utilized onto real access control systems.

  Durr","Deep Learning with Cinematic Rendering: Fine-Tuning Deep Neural Networks
  Using Photorealistic Medical Images","14 Pages, 4 Figures, 3 Tables, Physics in Medicine and Biology (2018)",,"10.1088/1361-6560/aada93",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence tool to
interpret medical images for a growing variety of applications. However, the
paucity of medical imaging data with high-quality annotations that is necessary
for training such methods ultimately limits their performance. Medical data is
challenging to acquire due to privacy issues, shortage of experts available for
annotation, limited representation of rare conditions and cost. This problem
has previously been addressed by using synthetically generated data. However,
networks trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data.
Cinematic rendering simulates the propagation and interaction of light passing
through tissue models reconstructed from CT data, enabling the generation of
photorealistic images. In this paper, we present one of the first applications
of cinematic rendering in deep learning, in which we propose to fine-tune
synthetic data-driven networks using cinematically rendered CT data for the
task of monocular depth estimation in endoscopy. Our experiments demonstrate
that: (a) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on synthetic data and
fine-tuned on photorealistic cinematically rendered data adapt better to real
medical images and demonstrate more robust performance when compared to
networks with no fine-tuning, (b) these fine-tuned networks require less
training data to converge to an optimal solution, and (c) fine-tuning with data
from a variety of photorealistic rendering conditions of the same scene
prevents the network from learning patient-specific information and aids in
generalizability of the model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that
networks fine-tuned with cinematically rendered data predict depth with 56.87%
less error for rendered endoscopy images and 27.49% less error for real porcine
colon endoscopy images.

  Transfer Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The focus in machine learning has branched beyond training classifiers on a
single task to investigating how previously acquired knowledge in a source
domain can be leveraged to facilitate learning in a related target domain,
known as inductive transfer learning. Three active lines of research have
independently explored transfer learning using neural networks. In weight
transfer, a model trained on the source domain is used as an initialization
point for a network to be trained on the target domain. In deep metric
learning, the source domain is used to construct an embedding that captures
class structure in both the source and target domains. In few-shot learning,
the focus is on generalizing well in the target domain based on a limited
number of labeled examples. We compare state-of-the-art methods from these
three paradigms and also explore hybrid adapted-embedding methods that use
limited target-domain data to fine tune embeddings constructed from
source-domain data. We conduct a systematic comparison of methods in a variety
of domains, varying the number of labeled instances available in the target
domain ($k$), as well as the number of target-domain classes. We reach three
principal conclusions: (1) Deep embeddings are far superior, compared to weight
transfer, as a starting point for inter-domain transfer or model re-use (2) Our
hybrid methods robustly outperform every few-shot learning and every deep
metric learning method previously proposed, with a mean error reduction of 34%
over state-of-the-art. (3) Among loss functions for discovering embeddings, the
histogram loss (Ustinova & Lempitsky, 2016) is most robust. We hope our results
will motivate a unification of research in weight transfer, deep metric
learning, and few-shot learning.

a completely different composition, with a mass fraction of about 70% metallic
core and 30% silicate mantle. Several formation or evolution scenarios are
proposed to explain this metal-rich composition, such as a giant impact, mantle
evaporation, or the depletion of silicate at the inner-edge of the
proto-planetary disk. These scenarios are still strongly debated. Here we
report the discovery of a multiple transiting planetary system (K2-229), in
which the inner planet has a radius of 1.165+/-0.066 Rearth and a mass of
2.59+/-0.43 Mearth. This Earth-sized planet thus has a core-mass fraction that
is compatible with that of Mercury, while it was expected to be similar to that
of the Earth based on host-star chemistry. This larger Mercury analogue either
formed with a very peculiar composition or it has evolved since, e.g. by losing
part of its mantle. Further characterisation of Mercury-like exoplanets like
K2-229 b will help putting the detailed in-situ observations of Mercury (with
Messenger and BepiColombo) into the global context of the formation and

semantics and makes a clear separation between architecture and behavior to
allow for compositional and incremental design and analysis of systems. We
distinguish local from global aspects. Local aspects model concerns at the
component level and are used to refine the behavior of components. Global
aspects model concerns at the architecture level, and hence refine
communications (synchronization and data transfer) between components. We
formalize local and global aspects as well as their composition and integration
into a BIP system through rigorous transformation primitives. We present
AOP-BIP, a tool for Aspect-Oriented Programming of BIP systems, demonstrate its
use to modularize logging, security, and fault tolerance in a network protocol,

by the EP-violating driving force in the Solar neighborhood that is determined

obtain a competing limit on $\eta_{\rm DM}$ from a neutron star (NS) -- white

difference between the NS and the WD, and the large gravitational binding
energy of the NS. If we can discover a binary pulsar within $\sim 10$ parsecs
of the Galactic center, where the driving force is much larger in the expected
DM spike, precision timing will improve the test of the universality of free
fall towards DM and constrain various proposed couplings of DM to the Standard
Model by several orders of magnitude. Such a test probes the hypothesis that
gravity is the only long-range interaction between DM and ordinary matter.

problems in statistical and array signal processing. Methods which rely on the
orthogonality of the signal and noise subspaces, such as Pisarenko's method,
MUSIC, and root-MUSIC are some of the most widely used algorithms to solve
these problems. As a common feature, these methods require both apriori
knowledge of the number of sources, and an estimate of the noise subspace. Both
requirements are complicating factors to the practical implementation of the
algorithms, and when not satisfied exactly, can potentially lead to severe
errors. In this paper, we propose a new localization criterion based on the
algebraic structure of the noise subspace that is described for the first time
to the best of our knowledge. Using this criterion and the relationship between
the source localization problem and the problem of computing the greatest
common divisor (GCD), or more practically approximate GCD, for polynomials, we
propose two algorithms which adaptively learn the number of sources and
estimate their locations. Simulation results show a significant improvement
over root-MUSIC in challenging scenarios such as closely located sources, both
in terms of detection of the number of sources and their localization over a
broad and practical range of SNRs. Further, no performance sacrifice in simple
scenarios is observed.

that an edge-colouring of a graph is locally $\ell$-bounded if no vertex is

(globally) $g$-bounded if no colour appears more than $g$ times in the

  (i) The existence of approximate decompositions of edge-coloured $K_n$ into
rainbow almost-spanning cycles, provided that the colouring is
$\frac{n}{2}$-bounded and locally $o(n)$-bounded. (ii) The existence of
approximate decompositions of edge-coloured $K_n$ into rainbow Hamilton cycles,

most viable alternatives for the highly energy consuming proof-of-work
blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their particularity is that they aim
at offering strong consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two
ingredients (i) a set of validators that generate blocks via a variant of
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a
selection strategy that dynamically selects nodes to be validators for the next
block via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However,the exact assumptions on the
system model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms are correct and the
exact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally analyzed. The
contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint
algorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem
solved by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified
version of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of
one-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of
the repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if
the set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each
one-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine.
Our second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It
is common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is
the tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding
mechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair,
i.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We
prove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus
based blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and
only if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original
Tendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original
protocol makes it eventually fair.

been successfully applied in computer vision, speech, natural language
processing, and so on. Distributed deep learning is becoming a necessity to
cope with growing data and model sizes. Its computation is typically
characterized by a simple tensor data abstraction to model multi-dimensional
matrices, a data-flow graph to model computation, and iterative executions with
relatively frequent synchronizations, thereby making it substantially different
from Map/Reduce style distributed big data computation.
  RPC, commonly used as the communication primitive, has been adopted by
popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, which uses gRPC. We show
that RPC is sub-optimal for distributed deep learning computation, especially
on an RDMA-capable network. The tensor abstraction and data-flow graph, coupled
with an RDMA network, offers the opportunity to reduce the unnecessary overhead
(e.g., memory copy) without sacrificing programmability and generality. In
particular, from a data access point of view, a remote machine is abstracted
just as a ""device"" on an RDMA channel, with a simple memory interface for
allocating, reading, and writing memory regions. Our graph analyzer looks at
both the data flow graph and the tensors to optimize memory allocation and
remote data access using this interface. The result is up to 25 times speedup
in representative deep learning benchmarks against the standard gRPC in
TensorFlow and up to 169% improvement even against an RPC implementation
optimized for RDMA, leading to faster convergence in the training process.

classification accuracy -- i.e. the task of classifying predictions as correct
or incorrect without knowing the actual label -- as for entropy thresholding.
We apply meta classification to unknown concepts (out-of-distribution samples)
-- EMNIST/Omniglot letters, CIFAR10 and noise -- and demonstrate that meta
classification rates for unknown concepts can be increased when using entropy
together with several gradient based metrics as input quantities for a meta
classifier. Meta classifiers only trained on the uncertainty metrics of known
concepts, i.e. EMNIST digits, usually do not perform equally well for all
unknown concepts. If we however allow the meta classifier to be trained on
uncertainty metrics for some out-of-distribution samples, meta classification
for concepts remote from EMNIST digits (then termed known unknowns) can be
improved considerably.

and assessed a hybrid micro-macro agent-based model, where price impact arises
endogenously through the limit order placement activity of algorithmic traders.
Our novel hybrid microscopic and macroscopic model allows us to quantify
systemic risk not just in terms of system stability, but also in terms of the
speed of financial distress propagation over intraday timescales. We find that
systemic risk is strongly dependent on the behaviour of algorithmic traders, on
leverage management practices, and on network topology. Our results demonstrate
that, for high-crowding regimes, contagion speed is a non-monotone function of
portfolio diversification. We also find the surprising result that, in certain
circumstances, increased portfolio crowding is beneficial to systemic
stability. We are not aware of previous studies that have exhibited this
phenomenon, and our results establish the importance of considering non-uniform
asset allocations in future studies. Finally, we characterise the time window
available for regulatory interventions during the propagation of flash crash
distress, with results suggesting ex ante precautions may have higher efficacy

exhibiting a dynamical spatial curvature. For this model the present day cosmic
acceleration is not attributed to a negative pressure (dark energy) but it is
driven by a nontrivial energy flow leading to a negative spatial curvature. In
this paper we generalize the NRCM in two different ways to the relativistic
regime and present analytical solutions of the corresponding Einstein
equations. These relativistic models are characterized by two inequivalent
extensions of the FLWR metric with a time-dependent curvature function $K (t)$
and an expansion scalar $a(t)$. The fluid flow is supposed to be geodesic. The
model V1 is shear-free with isotropic pressure and therefore conformal flat. In
contrast to V1 the second model V2 shows a nontrivial shear and an anisotropic
pressure. For both models the inhomogeneous solutions of the corresponding
Einstein equations will agree in leading order at small distances with the NRCM
if a(t) and K(t) are each identical with those determined in the NCRM. Then the
metric is completely fixed by three constants. The arising energy momentum
tensor contains a nontrivial energy flow vector. Our models violate locally the
weak energy condition. Global volume averaging leads to explicit expressions
for the effective scale factor and the expansion rate $H (z)$. Backreaction
effects cancel each other for the model V2 but they are nonzero and
proportional to the square of the magnitude of the energy flow for the model
V1. The large scale (relativistic) corrections to the NCRM results are small
for the model V2 for a small-sized energy flow. We have reproduced a

Time-energy entangled photons with tailored spectro-temporal properties are

study the generation of photon pairs in cavity-assisted SPDC and SFWM for the
general case of off-resonant conversion, namely, when the frequencies of the

in particular depends on temperature and requires an additional control in the

Films grown on orthorhombic (110) DyScO3 (DSO) are found to display untwinned
bulk-like orthorhombic structure. However, film deposition on cubic (001)
SrTiO3 induces a twinned growth of SIO. Resistance measurements on the SIO
films reveal only weak temperature dependence, where the resistance R increases
with decreasing temperature T. Hall measurements show dominant electron-like
transport throughout the temperature range from 2 K to 300 K. At 2 K, the
electron concentration and resistivity for SIO on STO amount to ne = 1.4*10^20

along the [1-10] and the [001] direction differs by up to 25% indicating
pronounced anisotropic electronic transport. The anisotropy of the resistance
increases with decreasing T and displays a distinct maximum around 86 K. The
specific T-dependence is similar to that of the structural anisotropy
sqrt(a2+b2)/c of bulk SIO. Therefore, anisotropic electronic transport in SIO
is very likely induced by the orthorhombic distortion. Consequently, for
twinned SIO films on STO anisotropy vanishes nearly completely. The
experimental results show that structural changes are very likely responsible
for the observed anisotropic electronic transport. The strong sensitivity of
the electronic transport in SIO films may be explained in terms of the narrow
electron-like bands in SIO caused by spin-orbit-coupling and orthorhombic
distortion.

demonstrate, through magneto-optical imaging, that the magnetic domain

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in these systems by Brillouin light

conclude that the DMI is largely insensitive to both AFM spin order and

N${\'e}$el domain walls and skyrmions, in FM-AFM heterostructures.

due to the better performance compared with traditional appearance-based
methods. However, there still exist two problems to be further solved. First,
existing pose-based methods generally recognize human actions with captured 3D
human poses which are very difficult to obtain in real scenarios. Second, few
pose-based methods model the action-related objects in recognizing human-object
interaction actions in which objects play an important role. To solve the
problems above, we propose a pose-based two-stream relational network (PSRN)
for action recognition. In PSRN, one stream models the temporal dynamics of the
targeted 2D human pose sequences which are directly extracted from raw videos,
and the other stream models the action-related objects from a randomly sampled
video frame. Most importantly, instead of fusing two-streams in the class score
layer as before, we propose a pose-object relational network to model the
relationship between human poses and action-related objects. We evaluate the
proposed PSRN on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., Sub-JHMDB and PennAction.
Experimental results show that our PSRN obtains the state-the-of-art
performance on Sub-JHMDB (80.2%) and PennAction (98.1%). Our work opens a new
door to action recognition by combining 2D human pose extracted from raw video

The joint point in the nodal net structure is a special double Dirac point

necessary, and also different from the accidental nodal net, this HNN structure
is inevitably formed and guaranteed by spinless nonsymmorphic symmetries, and
thus robust against any symmetry-remaining perturbations. The Fermi surface in
Ag2BiO3 consisting of a torus-like electron pocket and a torus-like hole pocket
may lead to unusual transport properties. A simple four-band tight-binding

relationships between instruments based on dissimilarity ratings. However,
these spaces do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an
invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. In parallel, generative models
have aimed to provide methods for synthesizing novel timbres. However, these
systems do not provide an understanding of their inner workings and are usually
not related to any perceptually relevant information. Here, we show that
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can alleviate all of these limitations by
constructing generative timbre spaces. To do so, we adapt VAEs to learn an
audio latent space, while using perceptual ratings from timbre studies to
regularize the organization of this space. The resulting space allows us to
analyze novel instruments, while being able to synthesize audio from any point
of this space. We introduce a specific regularization allowing to enforce any
given similarity distances onto these spaces. We show that the resulting space
provide almost similar distance relationships as timbre spaces. We evaluate
several spectral transforms and show that the Non-Stationary Gabor Transform
(NSGT) provides the highest correlation to timbre spaces and the best quality
of synthesis. Furthermore, we show that these spaces can generalize to novel
instruments and can generate any path between instruments to understand their
timbre relationships. As these spaces are continuous, we study how audio
descriptors behave along the latent dimensions. We show that even though
descriptors have an overall non-linear topology, they follow a locally smooth
evolution. Based on this, we introduce a method for descriptor-based synthesis

the idea of a state-of-the-art object detector and highly overlapping areas of

false negatives. Based on the raw bounding boxes of the detector we fine-tuned
overlapping bounding boxes by three approaches: non-maximum suppression, soft
non-maximum suppression and soft non-maximum suppression with Gaussian
smoothing. The evaluation was done on the PIROPO database and an own annotated
Flat dataset, supplemented with bounding boxes on omnidirectional images. We
achieve an average precision of 64.4 % with YOLOv2 for the class person on

function of every galaxy's Fourier transform after deconvolving the Point
Spread Function (PSF) in Fourier space. We propose a novel normalization scheme
to construct dimensionless ellipticity and its corresponding shear responsivity
using these shapelet modes. Shear is measured in a conventional way by
averaging the ellipticities and responsivities over a large ensemble of
galaxies. With the introduction and tuning of a weighting parameter, noise bias
is reduced below one percent of the shear signal. We also provide an iterative
method to reduce selection bias. The FPFS estimator is developed without any
assumption on galaxy morphology, nor any approximation for PSF correction.
Moreover, our method does not rely on heavy image manipulations nor complicated
statistical procedures. We test the FPFS shear estimator using several HSC-like
image simulations and the main results are listed as follows. (i) For
simulations which only contain isolated galaxies, the amplitude of
multiplicative bias is below 1 % . (ii) For more realistic simulations which
also contain blended galaxies, the blended galaxies are deblended by the first
generation HSC deblender before shear measurement. Multiplicative bias of
(-5.71 +- 0.31) % is found. The blending bias is calibrated by image
simulations. Finally, we test the consistency and stability of this
calibration.

which has the potential to produce consistent estimates without such an

uncertainty of parameter estimates, something that most methods currently
cannot accomplish. This work is motivated by a longitudinal study on
macrocephaly, or atypically large head size, in which electronic medical
records allow for the collection of a great deal of data. However, the sampling
is highly variable from child to child. Using MISFIT we are able to clearly
demonstrate that the development of pathologic conditions related to

regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime where classical
learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit. While
many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to
rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why
DNNs do not strongly overfit. In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By
applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from
algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map
of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then
provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for
Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional
networks applied to CIFAR10 and MNIST. As the target functions in many real
problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias
helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems. This
picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken
over the DNN input-output function space, rather than the more conventional
prior over parameter space. If we assume that the training algorithm samples
parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes
theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target
functions producing high-likelihood training sets. By exploiting recently
discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the
marginal likelihood, we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error
bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as
MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully
connected networks.

substance undergoes its dramatic slowing down in kinetics while remaining
barely distinguishable in structure from the fluid state upon cooling
constitutes the central question of glass transition physics. Here, we
experimentally tested the pathway of kinetic slowing down in
glass$\textrm{-}$forming liquids that consisted of ellipsoidal or binary
spherical colloids. In contrast to rotational motion, the exponential scaling
between diffusion coefficient and excess entropy in translational motion was
revealed to break down at startlingly low area fractions ($\phi_\textrm{T}$)
due to glassy effects. At $\phi_\textrm{T}$, anormalous translation-rotation
coupling was enhanced and the topography of the free energy landscape became
rugged. Basing on the positive correlation between $\phi_\textrm{T}$ and
fragility, the measurement of $\phi_\textrm{T}$ offers a novel method for
predicting liquids' relaxation while circumventing the prohibitive increase in
equilibrium times required in high density regions. Our results highlight the
role that thermodynamical entropy plays in glass transitions.

on the social network as initial seeds and push MCS tasks to them. Then,
influenced users who accept tasks are recruited as workers, and the ultimate
goal is to maximize the coverage. Specifically, to select a near-optimal set of

based on the interdependency of geographical positions among friends. Empirical
studies on two real-world datasets verify that Fast-Selector achieves higher

more efficient than Basic-Selector while only sacrificing a slight fraction of

extend the emerging technique named screening in large-scale sparse learning to
SFM for accelerating its optimization process. We first conduct a careful

Weinberger et al. (2009), is one of the key techniques used in scaling-up
machine learning algorithms. Loosely speaking, feature hashing uses a random
sparse projection matrix $A : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ (where $m \ll n$)
in order to reduce the dimension of the data from $n$ to $m$ while
approximately preserving the Euclidean norm. Every column of $A$ contains
exactly one non-zero entry, equals to either $-1$ or $1$.
  Weinberger et al. showed tail bounds on $\|Ax\|_2^2$. Specifically they
showed that for every $\varepsilon, \delta$, if $\|x\|_{\infty} / \|x\|_2$ is
sufficiently small, and $m$ is sufficiently large, then $$\Pr[ \; |
\;\|Ax\|_2^2 - \|x\|_2^2\; | < \varepsilon \|x\|_2^2 \;] \ge 1 - \delta \;.$$
These bounds were later extended by Dasgupta \etal (2010) and most recently
refined by Dahlgaard et al. (2017), however, the true nature of the performance
of this key technique, and specifically the correct tradeoff between the
pivotal parameters $\|x\|_{\infty} / \|x\|_2, m, \varepsilon, \delta$ remained
an open question.
  We settle this question by giving tight asymptotic bounds on the exact
tradeoff between the central parameters, thus providing a complete
understanding of the performance of feature hashing. We complement the
asymptotic bound with empirical data, which shows that the constants ""hiding""
in the asymptotic notation are, in fact, very close to $1$, thus further
illustrating the tightness of the presented bounds in practice.

replicated on all nodes in a network. To remedy this problem, it has been
suggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs),
such as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. Untrusted
blockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE.
  This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of
TEEs with blockchains. Since TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are
susceptible to rollback attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy
for the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus
protocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract
execution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing
blockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this
approach works only when the consensus decisions are final.
  Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for
smart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hyperledger Fabric, a
prominent platform for enterprise blockchain applications. Our system resolves
difficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric and
prevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible. For
increasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain
within its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation
shows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10%-20% for a
sealed-bid auction application.

that when the method is used with traditional feature detector and descriptor,

luminosity. Only about ten per cent of the hydrogen recombination energy might
be used to remove the envelope. We show that the key property of energy
transport is that when convection becomes inefficient in the outer parts of the
envelope, where the ionization degree of hydrogen falls below about 30 per
cent, photon diffusion becomes very efficient and removes the recombination
energy. The expanding envelope absorbs most of the gravitational energy that is
released by the spiraling-in process of the secondary star inside the common
envelope, and so it is the hydrogen recombination energy that is behind most of
the luminosity increase of the system. The recombination energy of hydrogen
adds only a small fraction of the energy required to remove the common
envelope, and hence does not play a significant role in the ejection of the
envelope.

Minimally Invasive Surgery systems constitutes a technological challenge due to
the constraints imposed by the surgical environment. In this context,
Sensorless Force Estimation techniques represent a potential solution, enabling
to sense the interaction forces between the surgical instruments and
soft-tissues. Specifically, if visual feedback is available for observing
soft-tissues' deformation, this feedback can be used to estimate the forces
applied to these tissues. To this end, a force estimation model, based on
Convolutional Neural Networks and Long-Short Term Memory networks, is proposed
in this work. This model is designed to process both, the spatiotemporal
information present in video sequences and the temporal structure of tool data
(the surgical tool-tip trajectory and its grasping status). A series of
analyses are carried out to reveal the advantages of the proposal and the
challenges that remain for real applications. This research work focuses on two
surgical task scenarios, referred to as pushing and pulling tissue. For these
two scenarios, different input data modalities and their effect on the force
estimation quality are investigated. These input data modalities are tool data,
video sequences and a combination of both. The results suggest that the force
estimation quality is better when both, the tool data and video sequences, are
processed by the neural network model. Moreover, this study reveals the need
for a loss function, designed to promote the modeling of smooth and sharp
details found in force signals. Finally, the results show that the modeling of
forces due to pulling tasks is more challenging than for the simplest pushing
actions.

its simplicity and robustness, but it can only provide a limited amount of
data. Therefore, it has been neglected in the past in favor of more complex
solutions. In this paper, we release to the community the data we collected in
[1] for further research activities in the field of pallet localization and
tracking. The dataset comprises a collection of 565 2D scans from real-world
environments, which are divided into 340 samples where pallets are present, and
225 samples where they are not. The data have been manually labelled and are
provided in different formats.

  Multiroom Environments, Path Planning and Other Control Tasks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extended Predictable Feature Analysis (PFAx) [Richthofer and Wiskott, 2017]
is an extension of PFA [Richthofer and Wiskott, 2015] that allows generating a
goal-directed control signal of an agent whose dynamics has previously been
learned during a training phase in an unsupervised manner. PFAx hardly requires
assumptions or prior knowledge of the agent's sensor or control mechanics, or
of the environment. It selects features from a high-dimensional input by
intrinsic predictability and organizes them into a reasonably low-dimensional
model.
  While PFA obtains a well predictable model, PFAx yields a model ideally
suited for manipulations with predictable outcome. This allows for
goal-directed manipulation of an agent and thus for local navigation, i.e. for
reaching states where intermediate actions can be chosen by a permanent descent
of distance to the goal. The approach is limited when it comes to global
navigation, e.g. involving obstacles or multiple rooms.
  In this article, we extend theoretical results from [Sprekeler and Wiskott,
2008], enabling PFAx to perform stable global navigation. So far, the most
widely exploited characteristic of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) was that
slowness yields invariances. We focus on another fundamental characteristics of
slow signals: They tend to yield monotonicity and one significant property of
monotonicity is that local optimization is sufficient to find a global optimum.
  We present an SFA-based algorithm that structures an environment such that
navigation tasks hierarchically decompose into subgoals. Each of these can be
efficiently achieved by PFAx, yielding an overall global solution of the task.
The algorithm needs to explore and process an environment only once and can
then perform all sorts of navigation tasks efficiently. We support this
algorithm by mathematical theory and apply it to different problems.

to develop systems that can provide assistance to surgeons, enable better
management of operating room (OR) resources and consequently improve safety
within the OR. State-of-the-art surgical phase recognition algorithms using
laparoscopic videos are based on fully supervised training. This limits their
potential for widespread application, since creation of manual annotations is
an expensive process considering the numerous types of existing surgeries and
the vast amount of laparoscopic videos available. In this work, we propose a
new self-supervised pre-training approach based on the prediction of remaining
surgery duration (RSD) from laparoscopic videos. The RSD prediction task is
used to pre-train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term
memory (LSTM) network in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed approach utilizes
all available data and reduces the reliance on annotated data, thereby
facilitating the scaling up of surgical phase recognition algorithms to
different kinds of surgeries. Additionally, we present EndoN2N, an end-to-end
trained CNN-LSTM model for surgical phase recognition and evaluate the
performance of our approach on a dataset of 120 Cholecystectomy laparoscopic
videos (Cholec120). This work also presents the first systematic study of
self-supervised pre-training approaches to understand the amount of annotations
required for surgical phase recognition. Interestingly, the proposed RSD
pre-training approach leads to performance improvement even when all the
training data is manually annotated and outperforms the single pre-training
approach for surgical phase recognition presently published in the literature.
It is also observed that end-to-end training of CNN-LSTM networks boosts
surgical phase recognition performance.

well as a purely data-driven inference. Specifically, we adopt an Empirical
Bayes approach in which the spatial field is modeled as a Gaussian Process,
whose mean function is described by means of parametrized equations. We
characterize the Empirical Bayes estimator when nodes are heterogeneous, i.e.,
perform a different number of measurements. Moreover, by exploiting the
sparsity of both the covariance and the (parametrized) mean function of the
Gaussian Process, we are able to design a distributed spatial field estimator.
We corroborate the theoretical results with two numerical simulations: a
stationary temperature field estimation in which the field is described by a
partial differential (heat) equation, and a data driven inference in which the
mean is parametrized by a cubic spline.

observational data while accounting for possible unobserved confounding.
Previous approaches, which assume unconfoundedness, i.e., that no unobserved
confounders affect both the treatment assignment as well as outcome, can lead
to policies that introduce harm rather than benefit when some unobserved
confounding is present, as is generally the case with observational data.
Instead, since policy value and regret may not be point-identifiable, we study
a method that minimizes the worst-case estimated regret of a candidate policy
against a baseline policy over an uncertainty set for propensity weights that
controls the extent of unobserved confounding. We prove generalization
guarantees that ensure our policy will be safe when applied in practice and
will in fact obtain the best-possible uniform control on the range of all
possible population regrets that agree with the possible extent of confounding.
We develop efficient algorithmic solutions to compute this confounding-robust
policy. Finally, we assess and compare our methods on synthetic and
semi-synthetic data. In particular, we consider a case study on personalizing
hormone replacement therapy based on observational data, where we validate our
results on a randomized experiment. We demonstrate that hidden confounding can
hinder existing policy learning approaches and lead to unwarranted harm, while
our robust approach guarantees safety and focuses on well-evidenced
improvement, a necessity for making personalized treatment policies learned
from observational data reliable in practice.

acurate perception of the surrounding is a crucial task as it involves the

Environmental processing requires accurate and robust quantification in order

a single particular set of sensors, it may become apparent that a unified
representation of the environment compiled from all available information

this approach is the means of developing a common information language from the

called inverse sensor models that create a common information language among
different, but typically agricultural, information providers. These can be
current live sensor data, farm management systems, or long term information

However, complex character of protein interactions impedes unsupervised

languages. In this work, we establish a framework for learning probabilistic
context-free grammars for protein sequences from syntactic trees partially

contrastive estimators of parameters for simple yet practical grammars. Tested

is proposed. A non-orthogonal MRT collision operator is devised based on a set
of non-orthogonal basis vectors, through which the transformation matrix and
its inverse matrix are considerably simplified as compared with those of an
orthogonal MRT collision operator. Furthermore, through the Chapman-Enskog

non-orthogonal MRT-LB model can correctly recover the macroscopic equations at
the Navier-Stokes level in the low Mach number limit. Numerical comparisons
between the non-orthogonal MRT-LB model and the usual orthogonal MRT-LB model
are made by simulating multiphase flows on the basis of the pseudopotential
multiphase LB approach. The numerical results show that, in comparison with the

by the autonomic nervous system, interactions between the cortex and these
primary functions are receiving an increasing interest in neurosciences. New
method: In general, the timing of such internally paced events (e.g. heartbeats
or respiratory cycles) may display a large variability. For the analysis of
such CR event-related EEG potentials, a baseline must be correctly associated
to each cycle of detected events. The open-source toolbox CARE-rCortex provides
an easy-to-use interface to detect CR events, define baselines, and analyse in
time-frequency (TF) domain the CR-based EEG potentials. Results: CARE-rCortex
provides some practical tools to detect and validate these CR events. Users can
define baselines time-locked to a phase of respiratory or heart cycle. A
statistical test has also been integrated to highlight significant points of
the TF maps with respect to the baseline. We illustrate the use of CARE-rCortex
with the analysis of two real cardio-respiratory datasets. Comparison with
existing methods: Compared to other open-source toolboxes, CARE-rCortex allows
users to automatically detect CR events, to define and check baselines for each
detected event. Different baseline normalizations can be used in the TF
analysis of EEG epochs. Conclusions: The analysis of CR-related EEG activities
could provide valuable information about cognitive or pathological brain
states. CARE-rCortex runs in Matlab as a plug-in of the EEGLAB software, and it

likelihood-free inference with applications in many disciplines. The
effectiveness of the method depends critically on the availability of well
performing summary statistics. Summary statistic selection relies heavily on
domain knowledge and carefully engineered features, and can be a laborious time
consuming process. Since the method is sensitive to data dimensionality, the
process of selecting summary statistics must balance the need to include
informative statistics and the dimensionality of the feature vector. This paper
proposes to treat the problem of dynamically selecting an appropriate summary
statistic from a given pool of candidate summary statistics as a multi-armed
bandit problem. This allows approximate Bayesian computation rejection sampling
to dynamically focus on a distribution over well performing summary statistics
as opposed to a fixed set of statistics. The proposed method is unique in that
it does not require any pre-processing and is scalable to a large number of
candidate statistics. This enables efficient use of a large library of possible
time series summary statistics without prior feature engineering. The proposed
approach is compared to state-of-the-art methods for summary statistics
selection using a challenging test problem from the systems biology literature.

guarantees that our circuits can in principle learn to perform arbitrary
input-output mappings. Our numerical simulations show that shallow quantum
circuits could be trained to discriminate among various pure and mixed quantum
states exhibiting a trade-off between minimizing erroneous and inconclusive
outcomes with comparable performance to theoretically optimal POVMs. We train
the circuit on different classes of quantum data and evaluate the
generalization error on unseen mixed quantum states. This generalization power
hence distinguishes our work from standard circuit optimization and provides an
example of quantum machine learning for a task that has inherently no classical

stellar populations (SP) in high-luminosity AGN is higher in the inner ($R \leq

on the other hand, present very similar fractions of young stars to the control

intermediate age SP of the AGN hosts increases outwards, with a clear

the small inner moons of Saturn, ranging from the unique ""ravioli-like"" forms
of Pan and Atlas to the highly elongated structure of Prometheus. Closest to
Saturn, these bodies provide important clues regarding the formation process of
small moons in close orbits around their host planet, but their range of
irregular shapes has not been explained yet. Here we show that the spectrum of
shapes among Saturn's small moons is a natural outcome of merging collisions
among similar-sized moonlets possessing physical properties and orbits that are
consistent with those of the current moons. A significant fraction of such
merging collisions take place either at the first encounter or after 1-2
hit-and-run events, with impact velocities in the range of 1-5 times the mutual
escape velocity. Close to head-on mergers result in flattened objects with
large equatorial ridges, as observed on Atlas and Pan. With slightly more
oblique impact angles, collisions lead to elongated, Prometheus-like shapes.
These results suggest that the current forms of the small moons provide direct
evidence of the processes at the final stages of their formation, involving
pairwise encounters of moonlets of comparable size. Finally, we show that this
mechanism may also explain the formation of Iapetus' equatorial ridge, as well
as its oblate shape.

This raises the question of whether there might be simple ways to improve the
test performance of an already trained model without having to re-train or
fine-tune it with new data. Here, we show that, surprisingly, this is indeed
possible. The key observation we make is that the layers of a deep network
close to the output layer contain independent, easily extractable
class-relevant information that is not contained in the output layer itself. We
propose to extract this extra class-relevant information using a simple
key-value cache memory to improve the classification performance of the model
at test time. Our cache memory is directly inspired by a similar cache model
previously proposed for language modeling (Grave et al., 2017). This cache
component does not require any training or fine-tuning; it can be applied to
any pre-trained model and, by properly setting only two hyper-parameters, leads
to significant improvements in its classification performance. Improvements are
observed across several architectures and datasets. In the cache component,
using features extracted from layers close to the output (but not from the
output layer itself) as keys leads to the largest improvements. Concatenating
features from multiple layers to form keys can further improve performance over
using single-layer features as keys. The cache component also has a
regularizing effect, a simple consequence of which is that it substantially
increases the robustness of models against adversarial attacks.

anomaly detection. For concreteness, we focus on the detection of cancer cells
located in a particular region of a blood vessel. These cancer cells produce
and emit special molecules, so-called biomarkers, which are symptomatic for the
presence of anomaly, into the cardiovascular system. Detection of cancer
biomarkers with conventional blood tests is difficult in the early stages of a
cancer due to the very low concentration of the biomarkers in the samples
taken. However, close to the cancer cells, the concentration of the cancer
biomarkers is high. Hence, detection is possible if a sensor with the ability
to detect these biomarkers is placed in the vicinity of the cancer cells.
Therefore, in this paper, we study the use of MNSs that are injected at a
suitable injection site and can move through the blood vessels of the
cardiovascular system, which potentially contain cancer cells. These MNSs can
be activated by the biomarkers close to the cancer cells, where the biomarker
concentration is sufficiently high. Eventually, the MNSs are collected by a
fusion center (FC) where their activation levels are read and exploited to
declare the presence of anomaly. We analytically derive the biomarker
concentration as well as the probability mass function of the MNSs' activation
levels and validate the obtained results via particle-based simulations. Then,
we derive the optimal decision rule for the FC regarding the presence of
anomaly assuming that the entire network is known at the FC. Finally, for the
FC, we propose a simple sum detector that does not require knowledge of the
network topology. Our simulations reveal that while the optimal detector
achieves a higher performance than the sum detector, both proposed detectors
significantly outperform a benchmark scheme that used fixed nanosensors at the
FC.

have been successfully accelerated and automated using graph-based design
languages. Different design strategies and mechanisms have been identified and
applied in the automation of the design processes. Approaches ranging from the
automated and declarative processing of constraints, through fractal nested
design patterns, to mathematical dimension-based derivation of the sequence of
design actions are used. The existing knowledge for a design determines the
global design strategy (top-down vs. bottom-up). Similarity-mechanics in the
form of dimensionless invariants are used for evaluation to downsize the
solution for an overall complexity reduction. Design patterns, design paradigms
(form follows function) and design strategies (divide and conquer) from
information science are heavily used to structure, manage and handle
complexity.

growing. Existing tools, both deployed and described in research, have proven
useful, but lack either the completeness or robustness needed for a general
solution. Existing detection approaches generally focus on only one aspect of
advertising or tracking (e.g. URL patterns, code structure), making existing
approaches susceptible to evasion.
  In this work we present AdGraph, a novel graph-based machine learning
approach for detecting advertising and tracking resources on the web. AdGraph
differs from existing approaches by building a graph representation of the HTML
structure, network requests, and JavaScript behavior of a webpage, and using
this unique representation to train a classifier for identifying advertising
and tracking resources. Because AdGraph considers many aspects of the context a
network request takes place in, it is less susceptible to the single-factor
evasion techniques that flummox existing approaches.
  We evaluate AdGraph on the Alexa top-10K websites, and find that it is highly
accurate, able to replicate the labels of human-generated filter lists with
95.33% accuracy, and can even identify many mistakes in filter lists. We
implement AdGraph as a modification to Chromium. AdGraph adds only minor
overhead to page loading and execution, and is actually faster than stock
Chromium on 42% of websites and AdBlock Plus on 78% of websites. Overall, we
conclude that AdGraph is both accurate enough and performant enough for online
use, breaking comparable or fewer websites than popular filter list based
approaches.

behavioral markers of mental health. However, this promise has not yet been
brought to fruition. Objective: The objective of our study was to examine
challenges involved in developing an app to extract behavioral markers of
mental health from passive sensor data. Methods: Both technical challenges and
acceptability of passive data collection for mental health research were
assessed based on literature review and results obtained from a feasibility
study. Socialise, a mobile phone app developed at the Black Dog Institute, was
used to collect sensor data (Bluetooth, global positioning system, and battery
status) and investigate views and experiences of a group of people with lived
experience of mental health challenges (N=32). Results: On average, sensor data
were obtained for 55% (Android) and 45% (iPhone OS) of scheduled scans. Battery
life was reduced from 21.3 hours to 18.8 hours when scanning every 5 minutes
with a reduction of 2.5 hours or 12%. Despite this relatively small reduction,
most participants reported that the app had a noticeable effect on their
battery life. In addition to battery life, the purpose of data collection,
trust in the organization that collects data, and perceived impact on privacy
were identified as main factors for acceptability. Conclusions: Based on the
findings of the feasibility study and literature review, we recommend a
commitment to open science and transparent reporting and stronger partnerships
and communication with users. Sensing technology has the potential to greatly
enhance the delivery and impact of mental health care. Realizing this requires
all aspects of mobile phone sensor technology to be rigorously assessed.

expected run time of a randomized search heuristic used drift theory, making it
the arguably most important tool in this domain. Its success is due to its ease
of use and its powerful result: drift theory allows the user to derive bounds
on the expected first-hitting time of a random process by bounding expected
local changes of the process -- the drift. This is usually far easier than
bounding the expected first-hitting time directly.
  Due to the widespread use of drift theory, it is of utmost importance to have
the best drift theorems possible. We improve the fundamental additive,
multiplicative, and variable drift theorems by stating them in a form as
general as possible and providing examples of why the restrictions we keep are
still necessary. Our additive drift theorem for upper bounds only requires the
process to be nonnegative, that is, we remove unnecessary restrictions like a
finite, discrete, or bounded search space. As corollaries, the same is true for
our upper bounds in the case of variable and multiplicative drift.

search for an alternative material became crucial. The electron device
community found many of the answers in two dimensional materials, especially
graphene. With an astounding mobility and perfectly symmetrical bandstructure,
graphene may be, just the replacement for silicon we have been looking for. In
this report, the mechanism of tunneling in a graphene-insulator-graphene (GIG)
junction has been studied, by applying Bardeen's transfer Hamiltonian approach.
Later, the formalism of the GIG junction has been used to study the performance
and current-voltage characteristics of a symmetric tunneling field effect
transistor or SymFET. The device exhibits a small tunneling current at most of
the biasing voltages. But when the Dirac points of the oppositely doped
graphene layers are aligned, a large amount of tunneling current is observed.
The performance of the device has been studied for various device dimensions.
The resonant current peak is also shown to increase for higher levels of
doping. The extraordinary symmetry of the I-V characteristics makes SymFET a
potential candidate for high speed analog devices. The SymFET is also shown to
be robust to temperature changes, since tunneling is the main mechanism of
charge transport. With further study and modifications, the SymFET can become a
popular choice for both analog and digital circuit implementation.

rates in systems with delay-distributed kernels and Gaussian noise. A general
variational formulation for the switching rate is derived for any distribution
kernel, and the obtained equations of motion and boundary conditions represent
the most probable, or optimal, path, which maximizes the probability of escape.
Explicit analytical results for the switching rates for small mean time delays
are obtained for the uniform and bi-modal (or two-peak) distributions. They
suggest that increasing the width of the distribution leads to an increase in
the switching times even for longer values of mean time delays for both
examples of the distribution kernel, and the increase is higher in the case of
the two-peak distribution. Analytical predictions are compared to the direct
numerical simulations, and show excellent agreement between theory and
numerical experiment.

  constant overheads",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Naive backpropagation through time has a memory footprint that grows linearly
in the sequence length, due to the need to store each state of the forward
propagation. This is a problem for large networks. Strategies have been
developed to trade memory for added computations, which results in a sublinear
growth of memory footprint or computation overhead. In this work, we present a
library that uses asynchronous storing and prefetching to move data to and from
slow and cheap stor- age. The library only stores and prefetches states as
frequently as possible without delaying the computation, and uses the optimal
Revolve backpropagation strategy for the computations in between. The memory
footprint of the backpropagation can thus be reduced to any size (e.g. to fit
into DRAM), while the computational overhead is constant in the sequence
length, and only depends on the ratio between compute and transfer times on a
given hardware. We show in experiments that by exploiting asyncronous data
transfer, our strategy is always at least as fast, and usually faster than the
previously studied ""optimal"" strategies.

allows turning expected stepwise changes into expected first-hitting times.
While drift theory is used extensively by the community studying randomized
search heuristics, it has seen hardly any applications outside of this field,
in spite of many research questions that can be formulated as first-hitting
times.
  We state the most useful drift theorems and demonstrate their use for various
randomized processes, including the coupon collector process, winning streaks,
approximating vertex cover, and a random sorting algorithm. We also consider
processes without expected stepwise change and give theorems based on drift
theory applicable in such scenarios. We use these theorems for the analysis of
the gambler's ruin process, for a coloring algorithm, for an algorithm for
2-SAT, and for a version of the Moran process without bias. A final tool we
present is a tight theorem for processes on finite state spaces, which we apply
to the Moran process.
  We aim to enable the reader to apply drift theory in their own research to
derive accessible proofs and to teach it as a simple tool for the analysis of
random processes.

presented. It is assumed that direct RF connection between mobile users and
source Base Station is impossible, therefore a relay connects RF users to the
source Base Station via a FSO link. Source and destination Base Stations are
connected via a multi-hop relay-assisted hybrid FSO / RF link. FSO link is
investigated over moderate to saturate regimes of atmospheric turbulence. Also
RF link is assumed to have Rayleigh fading. For the first time, new exact and
asymptotic expressions are derived in closed-form for Bit Error Rate (BER) and
the Outage Probability (P_out), of the proposed system. MATLAB simulations are
performed to validate obtained analytical results. Results indicate that the
proposed structure has low dependence on the number of users, therefore, the
proposed structure is suitable for cells which encounter different populations
during a day, because there is little performance difference between systems
with different number of users. Also the proposed structure, at Negative
exponential atmospheric turbulence has small dependence on the number of
relays, but this dependence is a bit more for Gamma-Gamma atmospheric
turbulence. Therefore, the proposed structure increases capacity whereas
maintaining performance of the system.

fields, but still limited in observation of dynamic scenes. In this paper, we
propose a snapshot hyperspectral imaging technique which exploits both spectral
and spatial sparsity of natural scenes. Under the computational imaging scheme,
we conduct spectral dimension reduction and spatial frequency truncation to the
hyperspectral data cube and snapshot it in a low cost manner. Specifically, we
modulate the spectral variations by several broadband spectral filters, and
then map these modulated images into different regions in the Fourier domain.
The encoded image compressed in both spectral and spatial are finally collected
by a monochrome detector. Correspondingly, the reconstruction is essentially a
Fourier domain extraction and spectral dimensional back projection with low
computational load. This Fourier-spectral multiplexing in a 2D sensor
simplifies both the encoding and decoding process, and makes hyperspectral data
captured in a low cost manner. We demonstrate the high performance of our
method by quantitative evaluation on simulation data and build a prototype
system experimentally for further validation.

lumped parameter model to estimate the time evolution of gas pressure $p_g$,
which for the first time takes into account the realistic effect of time-delay
arising due to multiple reasons such as valve response, pumping and transport
of gas, conductance of the pipe network, etc. The net effect of all such delays
taken together into a single (constant) delay term gives rise to a scalar delay
differential equation (DDE). Analytical solutions of a linear DDE in presence
of external forcing due to the (pulsed) injection of gas and outgassing from a
stainless steel (SS) wall are then derived using the Laplace transform method,
where the transcendental characteristic equation is approximated by means of
rational transfer functions such as diagonal Pad{\'e} approximation. A good
agreement is obtained with the numerical results and it is shown from these
solutions that a reasonably good match with experimental results is obtained
only in the presence of a nonzero time-delay. An attempt is also made to
simplify the DDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) by using a
low-order Taylor series expansion of the time-delay term. A singular
perturbation method is used to solve the resultant initial value problem (IVP)
type second-order ODE. It is found that unlike the Laplace transform method,
the ODE closely approximates the DDE only if the delay is small. Emergence of
stable periodic oscillations in $p_g$, as a generic supercritical Hopf
bifurcation, if time-delay exceeds a critical value is then established by
numerical and Poincar{\'e}-Lindstedt method.

use of energy recovery systems for building ventilation. We investigate the
efficiency of such systems under different outdoor conditions using exergy
analysis and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This analysis makes it possible to
assess performance in terms of loss of work potential, to account for the
different quality of energy and to localize and compare the different sources
of loss in the system. It also enables the use of exergy efficiency as a single
performance parameter, in contrast to the several indicators that are commonly
used. These more common indicators are difficult to compare and relate to each
other. Further, since there is no obvious optimal trade-off between them, it is
challenging to combine them and develop a global performance indicator that
allows for a sensible comparison of different technical solutions and different
types of recovery devices. We illustrate the concepts by applying the analysis
to a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) and to a structurally similar membrane
energy recovery ventilator (MERV) that can exchange both heat and moisture. We
show how the exergy efficiency can be used to identify the range of operating
conditions for which the recovery ventilator is not beneficial as the energy
cost is greater than the energy recovery. This is not trivial using traditional
performance parameters, yet it is a natural outcome of exergy analysis. In
addition, we identify the mechanism by which work potential is lost, which can
help the eventual optimization of both the recovery process and the auxiliary
systems present in ventilation systems.

volumetric displays. The principle is to illuminate a levitating particle
displaced at high velocity in three dimensions (3D) to create images based on
persistence of vision (POV). Light scattered by the particle can be observed
all around the volumetric display and therefore provides a true 3D image that
does not rely on interference effects and remains insensitive to the angle of
observation. The challenge is to control with a high accuracy and at high speed
the trajectory of the particle in three dimensions. Systems that use light to
generate free-space images either in plasma or with a bead are strictly
dependent of the scanning method used. Mechanical systems are required to scan
the particles in the volume which weakens the time dynamics. Here we use
electrically driven planar Paul traps (PPTs) to control the trajectory of
electrically charged particles. A single gold particle colloid is manipulated
in three dimensions through AC and DC electrical voltages applied to a PPT.
Electric voltages can be modulated at high frequencies (150 kHz) and allow for
a high speed displacement of particles without moving any other system
component. The optical scattering of the particle in levitation yields
free-space images that are imaged with conventional optics. The trajectory of
the particle is entirely encoded in the electric voltage and driven through
stationary planar electrodes. We show in this paper, the proof-of-concept for
the generation of 3D free space graphics with a single electrically scanned
particle.
