common events in alpine regions with high impact on transport routes. Within
the last few decades, hazard zone maps have been developed to systematically
approach this threat. These maps mark vulnerable zones in habitable areas to
allow effective planning of hazard mitigation measures and development of
settlements. Hazard zone maps have shown to be an effective tool to reduce
fatalities during extreme events. They are created in a complex process, based
on experience, empirical models, physical simulations and historical data. The
generation of such maps is therefore expensive and limited to crucially
important regions, e.g. permanently inhabited areas.
  In this work we interpret the task of hazard zone mapping as a classification
problem. Every point in a specific area has to be classified according to its
vulnerability. On a regional scale this leads to a segmentation problem, where
the total area has to be divided in the respective hazard zones. The recent
developments in artificial intelligence, namely convolutional neuronal
networks, have led to major improvement in a very similar task, image
classification and semantic segmentation, i.e. computer vision. We use a
convolutional neuronal network to identify terrain formations with the
potential for catastrophic snow avalanches and label points in their reach as
vulnerable. Repeating this procedure for all points allows us to generate an
artificial hazard zone map. We demonstrate that the approach is feasible and
promising based on the hazard zone map of the Tirolean Oberland. However, more
training data and further improvement of the method is required before such
techniques can be applied reliably.

for increasing the Cd concentration in cultivated soils and crops. This
suggestion has become a part of the accepted paradigm on soil toxicity.
Consequently, stringent fertilizer control programs to monitor Cd have been
launched. Attempts to link Cd toxicity and fertilizers to chronic diseases are
common. A re-assessment of this ""accepted"" paradigm is timely, given the larger
body of data available today. The data show that both the input and output of
Cd per hectare from fertilizers are negligibly small compared to the total
amount of Cd/hectare usually present in the soil itself. Calculations based on
current agricultural practices are used to show that it will take about 18
centuries to double the ambient soil-cadmium level, and about 8 centuries to
double the soil-fluoride level, even after neglecting leaching and other
removal effects. Hence the concern of long-term agriculture should be the
depletion of available phosphate fertilizers, rather than the contamination of
the soil by trace metals or fluoride. This conclusion is confirmed by showing
that the claimed correlations between fertilizer input and cadmium accumulation
in crops are not robust. Alternative scenarios that explain the data are
examined. Thus soil acidulation on fertilizer loading, and the effect of
magnesium, zinc, and fluoride ions contained in fertilizers are considered
using recent Cd$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$ and F$^-$ ion-association theories. The
protective role of ions like Zn, Se, Fe, etc., is emphasized, and the question
of cadmium toxicity in the presence of other ions is considered. These help to
clarify and rectify difficulties found in the standard point of view. This
analysis does not modify the accepted views on Cd contamination by airborne
delivery, smoking, and industrial activity, or P-contamination causing algal
blooms.

  entanglements","17 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entangled states are ubiquitous amongst fibrous materials, whether naturally
occurring (keratin, collagen, DNA) or synthetic (nanotube assemblies,
elastane). A key mechanical characteristic of these systems is their ability to
reorganise in response to external stimuli, as implicated in e.g.
hydration-induced swelling of keratin fibrils in human skin. During swelling,
the curvature of individual fibres changes to give a cooperative and reversible
structural reorganisation that opens up a pore network. The phenomenon is known
to be highly dependent on topology, even if the nature of this dependence is
not well understood: certain ordered entanglements (`weavings') can swell to
many times their original volume while others are entirely incapable of
swelling at all. Given this sensitivity to topology, it is puzzling how the
disordered entanglements of many real materials manage to support cooperative
dilation mechanisms. Here we use a combination of geometric and
lattice-dynamical modelling to study the effect of disorder on swelling
behaviour. The model system we devise spans a continuum of disordered
topologies and is bounded by ordered states whose swelling behaviour is already
known to be either vanishingly small or extreme. We find that while topological
disorder often quenches swelling behaviour, certain disordered states possess a
surprisingly large swelling capacity. Crucially, we show that the extreme
swelling response previously observed only for certain specific weavings can be
matched---and even superseded---by that of disordered entanglements. Our
results establish a counterintuitive link between topological disorder and
mechanical flexibility that has implications not only for polymer science but
also for our broader understanding of collective phenomena in disordered
systems.

Congestion (\STC) problem. Informally, the \STC problem seeks a spanning tree
with no tree-edge \emph{routing} too many of the original edges. The root of
this problem dates back to at least 30 years ago, motivated by applications in
network design, parallel computing and circuit design. Variants of the problem
have also seen algorithmic applications as a preprocessing step of several
important graph algorithms.
  For any general connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we show that
its STC is at most $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{mn})$, which is asymptotically optimal
since we also demonstrate graphs with STC at least $\Omega(\sqrt{mn})$. We
present a polynomial-time algorithm which computes a spanning tree with
congestion $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{mn}\cdot \log n)$. We also present another
algorithm for computing a spanning tree with congestion
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{mn})$; this algorithm runs in sub-exponential time when $m =
\omega(n \log^2 n)$.
  For achieving the above results, an important intermediate theorem is
\emph{generalized Gy\H{o}ri-Lov\'{a}sz theorem}, for which Chen et al. gave a
non-constructive proof. We give the first elementary and constructive proof by
providing a local search algorithm with running time $\mathcal{O}^*\left( 4^n
\right)$, which is a key ingredient of the above-mentioned sub-exponential time
algorithm. We discuss a few consequences of the theorem concerning graph
partitioning, which might be of independent interest.
  We also show that for any graph which satisfies certain \emph{expanding
properties}, its STC is at most $\mathcal{O}(n)$, and a corresponding spanning
tree can be computed in polynomial time. We then use this to show that a random
graph has STC $\Theta(n)$ with high probability.

viscosity ($\alpha$) and the disk mass injection rate, remain poorly
constrained. The light curves of Be stars that undergo events of disc formation
and dissipation offer an opportunity to constrain these quantities. A pipeline
was developed to model these events that uses a grid of synthetic light curves,
computed from coupled hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations. A
sample of 54 Be stars from the OGLE survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
was selected for this study. Because of the way our sample was selected (bright
stars with clear disc events), it likely represents the densest discs in the
SMC. Like their siblings in the Galaxy, the mass of the disc in the SMC
increases with the stellar mass. The typical mass and angular momentum loss
rates associated with the disk events are of the order of $\sim$$10^{-10}\,

of a few tenths, consistent with recent results in the literature and with the
ones found in dwarf novae, but larger than current theory predicts. Considering
the sample as a whole, the viscosity parameter is roughly two times larger at
build-up ($\left\langle\alpha_\mathrm{bu}\right\rangle = 0.63$) than at

methods for partitioning data points into the union of subspaces, with strong
theoretical guarantees. However, it is not practical for large data sets as it
requires solving a LASSO problem for each data point, where the number of
variables in each LASSO problem is the number of data points. To improve the
scalability of SSC, we propose to select a few sets of anchor points using a
randomized hierarchical clustering method, and, for each set of anchor points,
solve the LASSO problems for each data point allowing only anchor points to
have a non-zero weight (this reduces drastically the number of variables). This
generates a multilayer graph where each layer corresponds to a different set of
anchor points. Using the Grassmann manifold of orthogonal matrices, the shared
connectivity among the layers is summarized within a single subspace. Finally,
we use $k$-means clustering within that subspace to cluster the data points,
similarly as done by spectral clustering in SSC. We show on both synthetic and
real-world data sets that the proposed method not only allows SSC to scale to
large-scale data sets, but that it is also much more robust as it performs
significantly better on noisy data and on data with close susbspaces and
outliers, while it is not prone to oversegmentation.

flushing in basaltic systems have been never directly addressed experimentally,
making the role of CO2 in magma dynamics still controversial and object of
scientific debate. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the
response of magmas from Etna volcano to CO2 flushing. We performed a first
experiment at 300 MPa to synthesize a starting material composed of crystals of
some hundreds of m and melt pools. This material is representative of an
initial magmatic assemblage composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and a water
undersaturated melt. In a second step, the initial assemblage was equilibrated
at 300 and 100 MPa with fluids having different XCO2fl . Our experiments
demonstrate that flushing basaltic systems with fluids may drastically affect
crystal textures and phase equilibria depending on the amount of H2O and CO2 in
the fluid phase. Since texture and crystal proportions are among the most
important parameters governing the rheology of magmas, fluid flushing will also
influence magma ascent to the Earths surface. The experimental results open new
perspectives to decipher the textural and compositional record of minerals
observed in volcanic rocks from Mt. Etna, and at the same time offer the basis
for interpreting the information preserved in minerals from other basaltic
volcanoes erupting magmas enriched in CO2.

tangential velocity for the asymmetric drift in each distance bin. With SEGUE

the derived peculiar motion of the Sun and the slope of the rotation curve. The
rotation curve constructed through SEGUE G-dwarfs appears to be smooth in the
selected radial range. The local kinematics of the thin disc rotation as

$N$ lines with initial loads $L_1, \ldots, L_N$ and free-spaces (i.e.,
redundant space) $S_1, \ldots, S_N$ that are independent and identically
distributed with joint distribution $P_{LS}(x,y)=\mathbb{P}(L \leq x, S \leq
y)$. The capacity $C_i$ is the maximum load allowed on line $i$, and is given
by $C_i=L_i + S_i$. When a line fails due to overloading, it is removed from
the system and $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of the load it was carrying (at the
moment of failing) gets redistributed equally among all remaining lines in the
system; hence we refer to this as the {\it partial} load redistribution model.
The rest (i.e., $\varepsilon$-fraction) of the load is assumed to be lost or
absorbed, e.g., due to advanced circuitry disconnecting overloaded power lines
or an inter-connected network/material absorbing a fraction of the flow from
overloaded lines. We analyze the robustness of this flow network against random
attacks that remove a $p$-fraction of the lines. Our contributions include (i)
deriving the final fraction of alive lines $n_{\infty}(p,\varepsilon)$ for all
$p, \varepsilon \in (0,1)$ and confirming the results via extensive
simulations; (ii) showing that partial redistribution might lead to (depending
on the parameter $0<\varepsilon \leq 1$) the order of transition at the
critical attack size $p^{*}$ changing from first to second-order; and (iii)
proving analytically that flow networks achieve maximum robustness (quantified
by the area $\int_{0}^{1} n_{\infty}(p,\varepsilon) \mathrm{d}p$) when all
lines have the same free-space regardless of their initial load. The optimality
of equal free-space allocation is also confirmed on real-world data from the UK

due to Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC 2017), which had codeword length
$2^{O(\sqrt{k})}$. Our construction remains efficient for circuit depths as

separating $\mathsf{P}$ from $\mathsf{NC^1}$.
  We obtain our codes via a new efficient non-malleable reduction from
small-depth tampering to split-state tampering. A novel aspect of our work is
the incorporation of techniques from unconditional derandomization into the

momentum space, following a reconstruction method for tensor correlators, based
on the solution of the conformal Ward identities (CWI' s), introduced in recent
works by Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis (BMS). We investigate and detail the
structure of the CWI's, their non-perturbative solutions and the transition to
momentum space, comparing them to perturbation theory by taking QED as an
example. We then proceed with an analysis of the $TJJ$ correlator, presenting
independent and detailed re-derivations of the conformal equations in the
reconstruction method of BMS, originally formulated using a minimal tensor
basis in the transverse traceless sector. A careful comparison with a second
basis introduced in previous studies shows that this correlator is affected by
one anomaly pole in the graviton (T) line, induced by renormalization. The
result shows that the origin of the anomaly, in this correlator, should be
necessarily attributed to the exchange of a massless effective degree of
freedom. Our results are then exemplified in massless QED at one-loop in
$d$-dimensions, expressed in terms of perturbative master integrals. An
independent analysis of the Fuchsian character of the solutions, which bypasses
the 3K integrals, is also presented. We show that the combination of field
theories at one-loop - with a specific field content of degenerate massless
scalar and fermions - is sufficient to generate the complete non-perturbative
solution, in agreement with a previous study in coordinate space. The result
shows that free conformal field theories, in specific dimensions, arrested at
one-loop, reproduce the general result for the $TJJ$. Analytical checks of this
correspondence are presented in $d=3,4$ and $5$ spacetime dimensions[..].

understand the conditions for global synchronization as a function of the

Numerical simulations show that the force required to synchronize the network

below a critical fraction, no matter how large is the force. Network topology
and properties of the forced nodes also affect the critical force for

parameter of a $d$-dimensional time series, which can be estimated by
approximately linear functionals of the empirical distribution function. We
consider a closed-end-method, which is motivated by the likelihood ratio test
principle and compare the new method with two alternative procedures. We also
incorporate self-normalization such that estimation of the long-run variance is
not necessary. We prove that for a large class of testing problems the new
detection scheme has asymptotic level $\alpha$ and is consistent. The
asymptotic theory is illustrated for the important cases of monitoring a change
in the mean, variance and correlation. By means of a simulation study it is
demonstrated that the new test performs better than the currently available
procedures for these problems.Finally the methodology is illustrated by a small
data example investigating index prices from the dot-com bubble.

realize the correlations between the MNPs we have used the Ising model with an
artificial temperature $T$ that controls the number of MNPs as well as their
correlations. In the $T\rightarrow 0$ limit, one retrieves the Gaussian free
field (GFF), and in the finite temperature the problem is equivalent to a GFF
in iso-potential islands. The problem is argued to be equivalent to a
scale-invariant random surface with some critical exponents which vary with $T$
and correspondingly are correlation-dependent. Two type of observables have
been considered: local and global quantities. We have observed that the MNPs
soften the random potential and reduce its statistical fluctuations. This
softening is observed in the local as well as the geometrical quantities. The
correlation function of the electrostatic and its total variance are observed
to be logarithmic just like the GFF, i.e. the roughness exponent remains zero
for all temperatures, whereas the proportionality constants scale with $T-T_c$.
The fractal dimension of iso-potential lines ($D_f$), the exponent of the
distribution function of the gyration radius ($\tau_r$), and the loop lengths
($\tau_l$), and also the exponent of the loop Green function $x_l$ change in
terms of $T-T_c$ in a power-law fashion, with some critical exponents reported
in the text. Importantly we have observed that
$D_f(T)-D_f(T_c)\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\xi(T)}}$, in which $\xi(T)$ is the spin
correlation length in the Ising model.

probe the rate of growth of cosmological perturbations. However, if galaxies
are aligned by large-scale tidal fields, then a sample with an
orientation-dependent selection effect has an additional anisotropy imprinted
onto its correlation function. We use the LOWZ and CMASS catalogs of SDSS-III
BOSS Data Release 12 to divide galaxies into two sub-samples based on their
offset from the Fundamental Plane, which should be correlated with orientation.
These sub-samples must trace the same underlying cosmology, but have opposite
orientation-dependent selection effects. We measure the clustering parameters
of each sub-sample and compare them in order to calculate the dimensionless
parameter $B$, a measure of how strongly galaxies are aligned by gravitational
tidal fields. We found that for CMASS (LOWZ), the measured $B$ was $-0.024 \pm
0.015$ ($-0.030 \pm 0.016$). This result can be compared to the theoretical
predictions of Hirata 2009, who argued that since galaxy formation physics does
not depend on the direction of the observer, the same intrinsic alignment
parameters that describe galaxy-ellipticity correlations should also describe
intrinsic alignments in the radial direction. We find that the ratio of
observed to theoretical values is $0.51\pm 0.32$ ($0.77\pm0.41$) for CMASS
(LOWZ). We combine the results to obtain a total ${\rm {Obs}/{Theory}} =
0.61\pm 0.26$. This measurement constitutes evidence (between 2 and 3$\sigma$)
for radial intrinsic alignments, and is consistent with theoretical
expectations ($<2\sigma$ difference).

classical semidefinite programs, for sufficiently large values of the
parameter. Recently, a correspondence has been established between
nonarchimedean semidefinite programs and stochastic mean payoff games with
perfect information. This correspondence relies on tropical geometry. It allows
one to solve generic nonarchimedean semidefinite feasibility problems, of large
scale, by means of stochastic game algorithms. In this paper, we show that the
mean payoff of these games can be interpreted as a condition number for the
corresponding nonarchimedean feasibility problems. This number measures how
close a feasible instance is from being infeasible, and vice versa. We show
that it coincides with the maximal radius of a ball in Hilbert's projective
metric, that is included in the feasible set. The geometric interpretation of
the condition number relies in particular on a duality theorem for tropical
semidefinite feasibility programs. Then, we bound the complexity of the
feasibility problem in terms of the condition number. We finally give explicit
bounds for this condition number, in terms of the characteristics of the
stochastic game. As a consequence, we show that the simplest algorithm to
decide whether a stochastic mean payoff game is winning, namely value
iteration, has a pseudopolynomial complexity when the number of random
positions is fixed.

different from DNNs trained with real labels. Here, we propose a novel
permutation approach that can differentiate memorization from learning in deep
neural networks (DNNs) trained as usual (i.e., using the real labels to guide
the learning, rather than shuffled labels). The evaluation of weather the DNN
has learned and/or memorized, happens in a separate step where we compare the
predictive performance of a shallow classifier trained with the features
learned by the DNN, against multiple instances of the same classifier, trained
on the same input, but using shuffled labels as outputs. By evaluating these
shallow classifiers in validation sets that share structure with the training
set, we are able to tell apart learning from memorization. Application of our
permutation approach to multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural
networks trained on image data corroborated many findings from other groups.
Most importantly, our illustrations also uncovered interesting dynamic patterns

Civilizations with a high density of devices and/or space junk in that region,
but otherwise similar to ours in terms of space technology (our working
definition of ""moderately advanced""), may leave a noticeable imprint on the
light curve of the parent star. The main contribution to such signature comes
from the exobelt edge, where its opacity is maximum due to geometrical

significant H$_2$ dissociation occurs. The atomic hydrogen from the highly
irradiated daysides of UHJs will transport some of the energy deposited on the

alternatively, a measured heat recirculation efficiency will require slower
wind speeds after accounting for H$_2$ dissociation/recombination.

follow-up coverage at both X-ray and optical/nIR wavelengths. The evolution of
LGRB afterglows depends on the density profile of the external medium, enabling
us to separate wind or ISM-like environments based on the observations. We do
this by identifying the environment that provides the best agreement between
estimates of $p$, the index of the underlying power-law distribution of
electron energies, as determined by the behavior of the afterglow in different
spectral/temporal regimes. At 11 rest-frame hours after trigger, we find a
roughly even split between ISM-like and wind-like environments. We further find
a 2$\sigma$ separation in the prompt emission energy distributions of wind-like
and ISM-like bursts. We investigate the underlying physical parameters of the
shock, and calculate the (degenerate) product of density and magnetic field
energy ($\epsilon_B$). We show that $\epsilon_B$ must be $\ll 10^{-2}$ to avoid
implied densities comparable to the intergalactic medium. Finally, we find that
the most precisely constrained observations disagree on $p$ by more than would
be expected based on observational errors alone. This suggests additional
sources of error that are not incorporated in the standard afterglow theory.
For the first time, we provide a measurement of this intrinsic error which can
be represented as an error in the estimate of $p$ of magnitude $0.25 \pm 0.04$.
When this error is included in the fits, the number of LGRBs with an identified

remains.

even though the distribution of the underlying Berry curvature is anisotropic,
the corresponding intrinsic component of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity
(LMC), bearing the signature of the chiral anomaly, is insensitive to the
direction of the external magnetic field ($B$) and increases as $B^2$, at least

scales as $n^3$ with the monopole charge. We demonstrate these outcomes for two
distinct scenarios, namely when inter-particle collisions in the Weyl medium

and intra-valley) scattering times. While in the former situation the
contribution to LMC from chiral anomaly is inseparable from the non-anomalous

nuclear outflow rates, indicating local in-situ acceleration of the

the background fields can be treated perturbatively we analytically solve the
model in its low-energy sector, i.e. we characterize the relevant phases and
the quantum phase transitions between them. Depending on the sign of the
effective quadratic Zeeman field $\epsilon$, two superfluid phases with
distinct nematic order appear. In addition, we uncover a spin-disordered
superfluid phase at strong coupling. We employ a combination of renormalization
group calculations and duality transformations to access the nature of the
phase transitions. At $\epsilon = 0$, a line of spin-charge separated pairs of
Luttinger liquids divides the two nematic phases and the transition to the spin
disordered state at strong coupling is of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
type. In contrast, at $\epsilon \neq 0$, the quantum critical theory separating
nematic and strong coupling spin disordered phases contains a Luttinger liquid
in the charge sector that is coupled to a Majorana fermion in the spin sector
(i.e. the critical theory at finite $\epsilon$ maps to a quantum critical Ising
model that is coupled to the charge Luttinger liquid). Due to an emergent
Lorentz symmetry, both have the same, logarithmically diverging velocity. We
discuss the experimental signatures of our findings that are relevant to
ongoing experiments in ultra-cold atomic gases of $^{23}$Na.

extend our BAO analysis to higher redshifts by fitting to the weighted mean of
2QDESp, SDSS DR5 UNIFORM, 2QZ and 2SLAQ quasar correlation functions, obtaining
a $7.6\%$ measurement compared to $3.9\%$ achieved by eBOSS DR14. Unlike for
the LRG surveys, the larger error on quasar correlation functions implies a
smaller role for nuisance parameters (accounting for scale-dependent
clustering) in providing a good fit to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Again
using only the error bars of arXiv:1705.06373v2 and ignoring any off-diagonal
covariance matrix terms, we find that the eBOSS peak significance reduces from
2.8 to $1.4\sigma$. We conclude that for both LRGs and quasars, the reported
BAO peak significances from the SDSS surveys depend sensitively on the accuracy
of the covariance matrix at large separations.

The matrix model is amenable of a Fermi gas formulation, which we use to

theory prediction. For the bosonic operator our result provides a clue for
finding the corresponding string dual configuration. Our matrix model is
consistent with recent proposals for computing Bremsstrahlung functions exactly

bursts (GRB), superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), and binary neutron star
mergers. Magnetar birth may be accompanied by the fall-back of stellar debris,
lasting for seconds or longer following the explosion. Accretion alters the
magnetar evolution by (1) providing an additional source of rotational energy
(or a potential sink, if the propeller mechanism operates); (2) enhancing the
spin-down luminosity above the dipole rate by compressing the magnetosphere and
expanding the polar cap region of open magnetic field lines; (3) supplying an
additional accretion-powered neutrino luminosity that sustains the wind
baryon-loading, even after the magnetar's internal neutrino luminosity has
subsided. The more complex evolution of the jet power and magnetization of an
accreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni yields GRB SNe and
irregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g.~bursts with precursors
followed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode).
Additional baryon-loading from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the
magnetar polar cap lengthens the timeframe over which the jet magnetization is
in the requisite range sigma ~< 1e3 for efficient gamma-ray emission, thereby
accommodating GRBs with ultra-long durations. Though accretion does not
significantly raise the maximum energy budget from the limit of <~ few 1e52
ergs for an isolated magnetar, it greatly expands the range of magnetic field
strengths and birth spin periods capable of powering GRB jets, reducing the
differences between the magnetar properties normally invoked to explain GRBs

have been proposed as progenitors of $z \geq 2$ compact quiescent galaxies
(cQGs). To test this connection, we present a detailed spatially resolved study
of the stars, dust and stellar mass in a sample of six submillimeter-bright
starburst galaxies at $z \sim 4.5$. The stellar UV emission probed by HST is
extended, irregular and shows evidence of multiple components. Informed by HST,
we deblend Spitzer/IRAC data at rest-frame optical finding that the systems are
undergoing minor mergers, with a typical stellar mass ratio of 1:6.5. The FIR
dust continuum emission traced by ALMA locates the bulk of star formation in
extremely compact regions (median $r_{\rm{e}} = 0.70 \pm 0.29$ kpc) and it is
in all cases associated with the most massive component of the mergers (median
$\log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 10.49 \pm 0.32$). We compare spatially resolved UV
slope ($\beta$) maps with the FIR dust continuum to study the infrared excess
($\rm{IRX} = L_{\rm{IR}}/L_{\rm{UV}}$)-$\beta$ relation. The SMGs display
systematically higher $\rm{IRX}$ values than expected from the nominal trend,
demonstrating that the FIR and UV emissions are spatially disconnected.
Finally, we show that the SMGs fall on the mass-size plane at smaller stellar
masses and sizes than cQGs at $z = 2$. Taking into account the expected
evolution in stellar mass and size between $z = 4.5$ and $z = 2$ due to the
ongoing starburst and mergers with minor companions, this is in agreement with
a direct evolutionary connection between the two populations.

exploded within circumstellar media in which the acceleration of the red
supergiant winds is taken into account. Because wind acceleration makes the
wind velocities near the progenitors low, the density of the immediate vicinity
of the red supergiant supernova progenitors can be higher than that
extrapolated by using a constant terminal wind velocity. Therefore, even if the
mass-loss rate of the progenitor is relatively low, it can have a dense
circumstellar medium at the immediate stellar vicinity and the early light
curves of Type IIP supernovae are significantly affected by it. We adopt a
simple beta velocity law to formulate the wind acceleration. We provide
bolometric and multicolor light curves of Type IIP supernovae exploding within
such accelerated winds from the combinations of three progenitors, 12 - 16
Msun; five beta, 1-5; seven mass-loss rates, 1e-5 - 1e-2 Msun/yr; and four
explosion energies, 0.5e51 - 2e51 erg. All the light curve models are available
at https://goo.gl/o5phYb. When the circumstellar density is sufficiently high,
our models do not show a classical shock breakout as a consequence of the
interaction with the dense and optically-thick circumstellar media. Instead,
they show a delayed 'wind breakout', substantially affecting early light curves
of Type IIP supernovae. We find that the mass-loss rates of the progenitors
need to be 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr to explain typical rise times of 5 - 10 days in
Type IIP supernovae assuming a dense circumstellar radius of 1e15 cm.

variability of over an order of magnitude. Using Chandra and Swift data to
further characterise their light curves, we find that two of these sources are
detected only once and could be X-ray binaries in outburst that only briefly
reach ULX luminosities. Two others are consistent with being super-Eddington
accreting sources with high levels of inter-observation variability. One
source, M51 ULX-4, demonstrates apparent bimodal flux behaviour that could
indicate the propeller regime. It has a hard X-ray spectrum, but no significant
pulsations in its timing data, although with an upper limit of 10% of the
signal pulsed at ~1.5 Hz a pulsating ULX cannot be excluded, particularly if
the pulsations are transient. By simulating XMM-Newton observations of a
population of pulsating ULXs, we predict that there could be approximately 200
other bimodal ULXs that have not been observed sufficiently well by XMM-Newton
to be identified as transient.

accessing data of individual patients, but there processing as a whole still
remains a task. However, EHRs that are composed of coherent, well-tabulated

From Support Vector Machines(SVM), we use Support Vector Classification(SVC),
from the linear model we import Perceptron. We also used the
K.neighborsclassifier and the decision tree classifiers. Furthermore, we use
the TPOT library to find an optimized pipeline using genetic algorithms. Using
the above classifiers, we score each one of them using k fold cross-validation.

hospitalization or mortality) are often noisy because of hospital organization
and other social factors. The noise in the data can hide the true signal
related to the exposure. The signal can be unveiled by performing a temporal
aggregation on health data and then using it as the response in regression
analysis. From aggregated series, a general methodology is introduced to
account for the particularities of an aggregated response in a regression
setting. This methodology can be used with usually applied regression models in
weather-related health studies, such as generalized additive models (GAM) and
distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM). In particular, the residuals are
modelled using an autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model to account for the
temporal dependence. The proposed methodology is illustrated by modelling the
influence of temperature on cardiovascular mortality in Canada. A comparison
with classical DLNMs is provided and several aggregation methods are compared.
Results show that there is an increase in the fit quality when the response is
aggregated, and that the estimated relationship focuses more on the outcome
over several days than the classical DLNM. More precisely, among various
investigated aggregation schemes, it was found that an aggregation with an
asymmetric Epanechnikov kernel is more suited for studying the
temperature-mortality relationship.

$\log t$ growth with no revival indicates that a sine-square deformed CFT
effectively has an infinite length, in agreement with previous studies based on
the energy spectrum analysis. Furthermore, we study the quench dynamics for a

  Mismatch",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern applications of artificial neural networks have yielded remarkable
performance gains in a wide range of tasks. However, recent studies have
discovered that such modelling strategy is vulnerable to Adversarial Examples,
i.e. examples with subtle perturbations often too small and imperceptible to
humans, but that can easily fool neural networks. Defense techniques against
adversarial examples have been proposed, but ensuring robust performance
against varying or novel types of attacks remains an open problem. In this
work, we focus on the detection setting, in which case attackers become
identifiable while models remain vulnerable. Particularly, we employ the
decision layer of independently trained models as features for posterior
detection. The proposed framework does not require any prior knowledge of
adversarial examples generation techniques, and can be directly employed along
with unmodified off-the-shelf models. Experiments on the standard MNIST and
CIFAR10 datasets deliver empirical evidence that such detection approach
generalizes well across not only different adversarial examples generation
methods but also quality degradation attacks. Non-linear binary classifiers
trained on top of our proposed features can achieve a high detection rate
(>90%) in a set of white-box attacks and maintain such performance when tested
against unseen attacks.

hydrodynamic and dust radiative transfer simulations, we address these
questions focusing on the recently discovered dusty galaxy A2744_YD4 ($z=8.38$,
Laporte et al. 2017}). We show that we can reproduce the observed spectral
energy distribution (SED) only using different physical values with respect to
the inferred ones by Laporte et al(2017), i.e. a star formation rate of
$\mathrm{SFR} = 78\;\rm M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$, a factor $\approx 4$ higher than
deduced from simple Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. In this case we find:
(a) dust attenuation (corresponding to $\tau_V=1.4$) is consistent with a Milky
Way extinction curve; (b) the dust-to-metal ratio is low, $f_\mathrm{d} \sim
0.08$, implying that early dust formation is rather inefficient; (c) the
luminosity-weighted dust temperature is high, $T_d=91\pm 23\, \rm K$, as a
result of the intense ($\approx 100\times$ MW) interstellar radiation field;
(d) due to the high $T_d$, the ALMA Band 7 detection can be explained by a
limited dust mass, $M_d=1.6\times 10^6 $M$_\odot$. Finally, the high dust
temperatures might solve the puzzling low infrared excess recently deduced for

sampling schemes are subgraph sampling, where we sample each vertex

edges between the sampled vertices and their neighbors.
  In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the number of motifs as
induced subgraphs under both models from a statistical perspective. We show
that: for any connected $h$ on $k$ vertices, to estimate $s=\mathsf{s}(h,G)$,
the number of copies of $h$ in the parent graph $G$ of maximum degree $d$, with
a multiplicative error of $\epsilon$, (a) For subgraph sampling, the optimal
sampling ratio $p$ is $\Theta_{k}(\max\{ (s\epsilon^2)^{-\frac{1}{k}}, \;

gravitationally accreting black holes (BHs). If known galaxies are removed to
sufficient depths the source-subtracted CIB fluctuations at near-IR can reveal
sources present in the first-stars-era and possibly new stellar populations at
more recent times. This review discusses the recent progress in this newly
emerging field which identified, with new data and methodology, significant
source-subtracted CIB fluctuations substantially in excess of what can be
produced by remaining known galaxies. The CIB fluctuations further appear
coherent with unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB) indicating a very high
fraction of BHs among the new sources producing the CIB fluctuations. These
observations have led to intensive theoretical efforts to explain the

have limitations in decisively probing these theories, their potentially
remarkable implications will be tested in the upcoming CIB measurements with
the ESA's Euclid dark energy mission. We describe the goals and methodologies

nor when they are combined. This supports expectations from standard
high-energy emission models.

Remote state preparation (RSP) is a similar distributed task in which the

from an ensemble of quantum states.) We study the communication complexity of
approximate remote state preparation, in which the goal is to prepare an

showed that the worst-case communication complexity of approximate RSP can be
bounded from above in terms of the maximum possible information in an encoding.
He also showed that this quantity is a lower bound for communication complexity

worst-case and average-case communication complexity of remote state
preparation in terms of non-asymptotic information-theoretic quantities. We
also show that the average-case communication complexity of RSP can be much

arises as dimensional reduction of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM theory in four
dimensions. As in other gauge theories with extended supersymmetry, the
classical scalar potential has flat directions which may destabilize numerical
simulations. In addition, the fermion determinant need not be positive and this
sign-problem may cause further problems in a stochastic treatment. We
demonstrate that $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ super Yang-Mills theory has actually no

quantum corrections. Only the bare mass of the scalars experience a finite
additive renormalization in this finite theory. On various lattices with
different lattice constants we determine the scalar masses and hopping
parameters for which the supersymmetry violating terms are minimal. By studying
four Ward identities and by monitoring the $\pi$-mass we show that
supersymmetry is indeed restored in the continuum limit. In the second part we
calculate the masses of the low-lying bound states. We find that in the
infinite-volume and supersymmetric continuum limit the Veneziano-Yankielowicz
super-multiplet becomes massless and the Farrar-Gabadadze-Schwetz

complex systems. Usually, these interactions are abstractions of the
communication/diffusion channels between the units of the system. Real complex
networks, e.g. traffic networks, reveal different operation phases governed by
the dynamical stress of the system. Here we show how, communicability, a
topological descriptor that reveals the efficiency of the network functionality
in terms of these diffusive paths, could be used to reveal the transitions
mentioned. By considering a vibrational model of nodes and edges in a
graph/network at a given temperature (stress), we show that the communicability
function plays the role of the thermal Green's function of a network of
harmonic oscillators. After, we prove analytically the existence of a universal
phase transition in the communicability structure of every simple graph. This
transition resembles the melting process occurring in solids. For instance,
regular-like graphs resembling crystals, melts at lower temperatures and
display a sharper transition between connected to disconnected structures than
the random spatial graphs, which resemble amorphous solids. Finally, we study
computationally this graph melting process in some real-world networks and
observe that the rate of melting of graphs changes either as an exponential or
as a power-law with the inverse temperature. At the local level we discover
that the main driver for node melting is the eigenvector centrality of the
corresponding node, particularly when the critical value of the inverse
temperature approaches zero. These universal results sheds light on many
dynamical diffusive-like processes on networks that present transitions as
traffic jams, communication lost or failure cascades.

interpretable models. Although many supposedly interpretable models have been
proposed, there have been relatively few experimental studies investigating
whether these models achieve their intended effects, such as making people more
closely follow a model's predictions when it is beneficial for them to do so or
enabling them to detect when a model has made a mistake. We present a sequence
of pre-registered experiments (N=3,800) in which we showed participants
functionally identical models that varied only in two factors commonly thought
to make machine learning models more or less interpretable: the number of
features and the transparency of the model (i.e., whether the model internals
are clear or black box). Predictably, participants who saw a clear model with
few features could better simulate the model's predictions. However, we did not
find that participants more closely followed its predictions. Furthermore,
showing participants a clear model meant that they were less able to detect and
correct for the model's sizable mistakes, seemingly due to information
overload. These counterintuitive findings emphasize the importance of testing
over intuition when developing interpretable models.

Implementation of a ledger object on top of multiple (possibly geographically

contrast to the centralized object, distribution allows operations to be
applied concurrently on the ledger, introducing challenges on the consistency
of the ledger in each participant. We provide the definitions of three well
known consistency guarantees in terms of the operations supported by the ledger
object: (1) atomic consistency (linearizability), (2) sequential consistency,
and (3) eventual consistency. We then provide implementations of distributed
ledgers on asynchronous message passing crash-prone systems using an Atomic
Broadcast service, and show that they provide eventual, sequential or atomic
consistency semantics. We conclude with a variation of the ledger - the
validated ledger - which requires that each record in the ledger satisfies a

X-ray emission of the Compton thick (CT) AGN ESO428-G014. The entire spectrum
is best fit with composite photoionization + thermal models. The diffuse
emission is more extended at the lower energies (<3 keV). The smaller extent of
the hard continuum and Fe K{\alpha} profiles imply that the optically thicker
clouds responsible for this scattering may be relatively more prevalent closer
to the nucleus. These clouds must not prevent soft ionizing X-rays from the AGN
escaping to larger radii, in order to have photoionized ISM at larger radii.
This suggests that at smaller radii there may be a larger population of
molecular clouds to scatter the hard X-rays, as in the Milky Way. The diffuse
emission is also significantly extended in the cross-cone direction, where the
AGN emission would be mostly obscured by the torus in the standard AGN model.
Our results suggest that the transmission of the obscuring region in the
cross-cone direction is ~10% than in the cone-direction. In the 0.3-1.5 keV
band, the ratio of cross-cone to cone photons increases to ~84\%, suggesting an
additional soft diffuse emission component, disjoint from the AGN. This could
be due to hot ISM trapped in the potential of the galaxy. The luminosity of
this component ~5 10^38 erg s^-1 is roughly consistent with the thermal
component suggested by the spectral fits in the 170-900 pc annulus.

test the proposed method in four relatively nearby regions of Orion A, Orion B,
Perseus, and California. We use rotation measure data from the literature. We
adopt a simple approach based on relative measurements to estimate the rotation
measure due to the molecular clouds over the Galactic contribution. We then use
a chemical evolution code along with extinction maps of each cloud to find the
electron column density of the molecular cloud at the position of each rotation
measure data point. Combining the rotation measures produced by the molecular
clouds and the electron column density, we calculate the line-of-sight magnetic
field strength and direction. In California and Orion A, we find clear evidence
that the magnetic fields at one side of these filamentary structures are
pointing towards us and are pointing away from us at the other side. Even
though the magnetic fields in Perseus might seem to suggest the same behavior,
not enough data points are available to draw such conclusions. In Orion B, as
well, there are not enough data points available to detect such behavior. This
behavior is consistent with a helical magnetic field morphology. In the

simple individual rules. Most of the mathematical research on such collective

But how could an (optimal) individual rule emerge during a short period within
the group lifetime, especially if communication is not available. We argue that
such rules can actually emerge in a group in a short span of time via
collective (multi-agent) reinforcement learning, i.e learning via rewards and
punishments. We consider the gathering problem: several agents (social animals,
swarming robots...) must gather around a same position, which is not determined
in advance. They must do so without communication on their planned decision,
just by looking at the position of other agents. We present the first
experimental evidence that a gathering behavior can be learned without
communication in a partially observable environment. The learned behavior has
the same properties as a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm, as processes
can gather from any initial state (and thus tolerate any transient failure).
Besides, we show that it is possible to tolerate the brutal loss of up to 90\%
of agents without significant impact on the behavior.

  Decompositions","12 pages. Appears in ICML 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Word embedding is a useful approach to capture co-occurrence structures in
large text corpora. However, in addition to the text data itself, we often have
additional covariates associated with individual corpus documents---e.g. the
demographic of the author, time and venue of publication---and we would like
the embedding to naturally capture this information. We propose CoVeR, a new
tensor decomposition model for vector embeddings with covariates. CoVeR jointly
learns a \emph{base} embedding for all the words as well as a weighted diagonal
matrix to model how each covariate affects the base embedding. To obtain author
or venue-specific embedding, for example, we can then simply multiply the base
embedding by the associated transformation matrix. The main advantages of our
approach are data efficiency and interpretability of the covariate
transformation. Our experiments demonstrate that our joint model learns
substantially better covariate-specific embeddings compared to the standard
approach of learning a separate embedding for each covariate using only the
relevant subset of data, as well as other related methods. Furthermore, CoVeR
encourages the embeddings to be ""topic-aligned"" in that the dimensions have
specific independent meanings. This allows our covariate-specific embeddings to
be compared by topic, enabling downstream differential analysis. We empirically
evaluate the benefits of our algorithm on datasets, and demonstrate how it can
be used to address many natural questions about covariate effects.

the occurrence of congestion. Moreover, a forwarding table entries compression
technique is used to reduce the computational complexity of CECT. In this way,
we mathematically formulate an optimization problem and define a genetic
algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. We test the proposed
algorithm on real-world network traffic. Our results show that CECT is
computationally fast and the solution is feasible in all cases. In order to

for sums involving these half-space Green's functions (stokeslets, stresslets

the corresponding free-space Green's functions. The fast method is based on two
main ingredients: The Ewald decomposition and subsequent use of FFTs. The Ewald
decomposition recasts the sum into a sum of two exponentially decaying series:
one in real-space (short-range interactions) and one in Fourier-space
(long-range interactions) with the convergence of each series controlled by a
common parameter. The evaluation of short-range interactions is accelerated by
restricting computations to neighbours within a specified distance, while the
use of FFTs accelerates the computations in Fourier-space thus accelerating the
overall sum. We demonstrate that while the method incurs extra costs for the
half-space in comparison to the free-space evaluation, greater computational
savings is also achieved when compared to their respective direct sums.

spectra obtained with the GMOS/IFU on the Gemini South telescope at a spatial
resolution of $\approx$170 pc and spectral resolution of 36 km s$^{-1}$. ESO
362-G18 is a strongly perturbed galaxy of morphological type Sa or S0/a, with a
minor merger approaching along the NE direction. Previous studies have shown
that the [OIII] emission shows a fan-shaped extension of $\approx$ 10\arcsec\
to the SE. We detect the [OIII] doublet, [NII] and H${\alpha}$ emission lines
throughout our field of view. The stellar kinematics is dominated by circular
motions in the galaxy plane, with a kinematic position angle of
$\approx$137$^{\circ}$. The gas kinematics is also dominated by rotation, with
kinematic position angles ranging from 122$^{\circ}$ to 139$^{\circ}$. A
double-Gaussian fit to the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 and H${\alpha}$ lines, which
have the highest signal to noise ratios of the emission lines, reveal two
kinematic components: (1) a component at lower radial velocities which we
interpret as gas rotating in the galactic disk; and (2) a component with line
of sight velocities 100-250 km s$^{-1}$ higher than the systemic velocity,
interpreted as originating in the outflowing gas within the AGN ionization
cone. We estimate a mass outflow rate of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ in the SE ionization cone (this rate doubles if we assume a biconical
configuration), and a mass accretion rate on the supermassive black hole (SMBH)
of 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The total ionized gas mass
within $\sim$84 pc of the nucleus is 3.3 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$; infall
velocities of $\sim$34 km s$^{-1}$ in this gas would be required to feed both
the outflow and SMBH accretion.

real-time is critical for occupants' safety and in-vehicular infotainment
applications. It must however, be noted that naturalistic driving scenes suffer
from rapidly changing illumination and occlusion. This is aggravated by the
fact that hands are highly deformable objects, and change in appearance
frequently. This work addresses the task of accurately localizing driver hands
and classifying the grasp state of each hand. We use a fast ConvNet to first
detect likely hand regions. Next, a pixel-based skin classifier that takes into
account the global illumination changes is used to refine the hand detections
and remove false positives. This step generates a pixel-level mask for each
hand. Finally, we study each such masked regions and detect if the driver is
grasping the wheel, or in some cases a mobile phone. Through evaluation we
demonstrate that our method can outperform state-of-the-art pixel based hand
detectors, while running faster (at 35 fps) than other deep ConvNet based
frameworks even for grasp analysis. Hand mask cues are shown to be crucial when
analyzing a set of driver hand gestures (wheel/mobile phone grasp and no-grasp)
in naturalistic driving settings. The proposed detection and localization
pipeline hence can act as a general framework for real-time hand detection and
gesture classification.

on timing and location appear to produce inconsistent results, making it hard
to design systems that use sentiment to detect localized events for public
health applications.
  Objective: The aim of this study was to measure how common timing and
location confounders explain variation in sentiment on Twitter.
  Methods: Using a dataset of 16.54 million English-language tweets from 100
cities posted between July 13 and November 30, 2017, we estimated the positive
and negative sentiment for each of the cities using a dictionary-based
sentiment analysis and constructed models to explain the differences in
sentiment using time of day, day of week, weather, city, and interaction type
(conversations or broadcasting) as factors and found that all factors were
independently associated with sentiment.
  Results: In the full multivariable model of positive (Pearson r in test data
0.236; 95\% CI 0.231-0.241) and negative (Pearson r in test data 0.306; 95\% CI
0.301-0.310) sentiment, the city and time of day explained more of the variance
than weather and day of week. Models that account for these confounders produce
a different distribution and ranking of important events compared with models
that do not account for these confounders.
  Conclusions: In public health applications that aim to detect localized
events by aggregating sentiment across populations of Twitter users, it is
worthwhile accounting for baseline differences before looking for unexpected
changes.

multi-speaker audio streams. The NPC framework exploits the proposed short-term
active-speaker stationarity hypothesis which assumes two temporally-close short

that can encode the commonalities of both the segments, should capture the
vocal characteristics of that speaker. We train a convolutional deep siamese

`different' speaker pairs which are generated from an unlabeled data of audio
streams. Two sets of experiments are done in different scenarios to evaluate
the strength of NPC embeddings and compare with state-of-the-art in-domain
supervised methods. First, two speaker identification experiments with
different context lengths are performed in a scenario with comparatively
limited within-speaker channel variability. NPC embeddings are found to perform
the best at short duration experiment, and they provide complementary
information to i-vectors for full utterance experiments. Second, a large scale
speaker verification task having a wide range of within-speaker channel
variability is adopted as an upper-bound experiment where comparisons are drawn
with in-domain supervised methods.

we infer the progenitor mass distribution for core-collapse supernovae. We use
Bayesian inference and model each SFH with multiple bursts of star formation
(SF), one of which is assumed to be associated with the SNR. Assuming
single-star evolution, the minimum mass of CCSNe is $7.33^{+0.02}_{-0.16}$
$\text{M}_\odot$, the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is $\alpha =
-2.96^{+0.45}_{-0.25}$, and the maximum mass is greater than
$\text{M}_\textrm{max} > 59$ $\text{M}_\odot$ with a 68% confidence. While
these results are consistent with previous inferences, they also provide
tighter constraints. The progenitor distribution is somewhat steeper than a
Salpeter initial mass function ($\alpha$ = -2.35). This suggests that either
SNR catalogs are biased against the youngest SF regions, or the most massive
stars do not explode as easily as lower mass stars. If SNR catalogs are biased,
it will most likely affect the slope but not the minimum mass. The
uncertainties are dominated by three primary sources of uncertainty, the SFH
resolution, the number of SF bursts, and the uncertainty on SF rate in each age
bin. We address the first two of these uncertainties, with an emphasis on
multiple bursts. The third will be addressed in future work.

distribution property testing and estimation. For estimating the Shannon
entropy of a distribution on $S$ elements with independent samples,
[Paninski2004] showed that the sample complexity is sublinear in $S$, and
[Valiant--Valiant2011] showed that consistent estimation of Shannon entropy is
possible if and only if the sample size $n$ far exceeds $\frac{S}{\log S}$. In
this paper we consider the problem of estimating the entropy rate of a
stationary reversible Markov chain with $S$ states from a sample path of $n$
observations. We show that:
  (1) As long as the Markov chain mixes not too slowly, i.e., the relaxation
time is at most $O(\frac{S}{\ln^3 S})$, consistent estimation is achievable
when $n \gg \frac{S^2}{\log S}$.
  (2) As long as the Markov chain has some slight dependency, i.e., the
relaxation time is at least $1+\Omega(\frac{\ln^2 S}{\sqrt{S}})$, consistent
estimation is impossible when $n \lesssim \frac{S^2}{\log S}$.
  Under both assumptions, the optimal estimation accuracy is shown to be
$\Theta(\frac{S^2}{n \log S})$. In comparison, the empirical entropy rate
requires at least $\Omega(S^2)$ samples to be consistent, even when the Markov
chain is memoryless. In addition to synthetic experiments, we also apply the
estimators that achieve the optimal sample complexity to estimate the entropy
rate of the English language in the Penn Treebank and the Google One Billion
Words corpora, which provides a natural benchmark for language modeling and
relates it directly to the widely used perplexity measure.

fixed background and search for sectors where the energy is well-defined and
causality is assured. A brief analysis of unitarity is included for particular

erasure codes for distributed storage that not only provide fault tolerance
with minimum storage redundancy but also achieve low computational complexity.
They are constructed by encoding $k$ information columns into $r$ parity
columns, in which each element in a column is a bit, such that any $k$ out of
the $k+r$ columns suffice to recover all information bits. In addition to
providing fault tolerance, it is critical to improve repair performance in
practical applications. Specifically, if a single column fails, our goal is to
minimize the repair bandwidth by downloading the least amount of bits from $d$
healthy columns, where $k\leq d\leq k+r-1$. If one column of an MDS code is
failed, it is known that we need to download at least $1/(d-k+1)$ fraction of
the data stored in each of $d$ healthy columns. If this lower bound is achieved
for the repair of the failure column from accessing arbitrary $d$ healthy
columns, we say that the MDS code has optimal repair. However, if such lower
bound is only achieved by $d$ specific healthy columns, then we say the MDS
code has weak-optimal repair. In this paper, we propose two explicit
constructions of binary MDS array codes with more parity columns (i.e., $r\geq
3$) that achieve asymptotically weak-optimal repair, where $k+1\leq d\leq
k+\lfloor(r-1)/2\rfloor$, and ""asymptotic"" means that the repair bandwidth
achieves the minimum value asymptotically in $d$. Codes in the first
construction have odd number of parity columns and asymptotically weak-optimal
repair for any one information failure, while codes in the second construction
have even number of parity columns and asymptotically weak-optimal repair for
any one column failure.

  https://fabienbaradel.github.io/cvpr18_glimpseclouds/","CVPR 2018",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a method for human activity recognition from RGB data that does
not rely on any pose information during test time and does not explicitly
calculate pose information internally. Instead, a visual attention module
learns to predict glimpse sequences in each frame. These glimpses correspond to
interest points in the scene that are relevant to the classified activities. No
spatial coherence is forced on the glimpse locations, which gives the module
liberty to explore different points at each frame and better optimize the
process of scrutinizing visual information. Tracking and sequentially
integrating this kind of unstructured data is a challenge, which we address by
separating the set of glimpses from a set of recurrent tracking/recognition
workers. These workers receive glimpses, jointly performing subsequent motion
tracking and activity prediction. The glimpses are soft-assigned to the
workers, optimizing coherence of the assignments in space, time and feature
space using an external memory module. No hard decisions are taken, i.e. each
glimpse point is assigned to all existing workers, albeit with different
importance. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art methods on the largest
human activity recognition dataset available to-date; NTU RGB+D Dataset, and on
a smaller human action recognition dataset Northwestern-UCLA Multiview Action

stimulated longitudinal slowing of heavy-atom molecules by the coherent optical
bichromatic force with a constant beat phase. Taking the YbF meolecule as an

A molecular beam of YbF with a forward velocity of 120 m/s can be decelerated
below 10 m/s within a distance of 3.5 cm and with a laser irradiance for each
traveling wave of 107.2 W/cm$^2$. We also give a simple approach to estimate
the performance of the BCF on some other heavy molecules, which is helpful for
making a rapid evaluation on the feasibility of the stimulated slowing

through the space constraint or the limited capture efficiency of molecules
loadable into a MOT in traditional deceleration schemes, opening the

Moreover, control over one region might affect activity of other downstream

developing a hybrid device of a cortical culture functionally integrated with a

re-identification (re-ID). The proposed framework largely aims to exploit the
adequate temporal information of video sequences and tackle the poor spatial
alignment of moving pedestrians. More specifically, for exploiting the temporal
information, we design a temporal residual learning (TRL) module to
simultaneously extract the generic and specific features of consecutive frames.
The TRL module is equipped with two bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM), which are
respectively responsible to describe a moving person in different aspects,
providing complementary information for better feature representations. To deal
with the poor spatial alignment in video re-ID datasets, we propose a
spatial-temporal transformer network (ST^2N) module. Transformation parameters
in the ST^2N module are learned by leveraging the high-level semantic
information of the current frame as well as the temporal context knowledge from
other frames. The proposed ST^2N module with less learnable parameters allows
effective person alignments under significant appearance changes. Extensive
experimental results on the large-scale MARS, PRID2011, ILIDS-VID and SDU-VID
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently superior
performance and outperforms most of the very recent state-of-the-art methods.

is implemented with fully relativistic and full-multipole frameworks, which are
relevant for such relativistic atomic systems. We consider the isotopes
$^{207}$Pb$^{79+}$ and $^{209}$Bi$^{80+}$ due to experimental interest, as well
as other examples of isotopes with lower $Z$, namely $^{141}$Pr$^{56+}$ and
$^{165}$Ho$^{64+}$. We conclude that quantum interference can induce shifts up
to 11% of the linewidth in the measurable resonances of the considered
isotopes, if interference between resonances is neglected. The inclusion of
relativity decreases the cross section by 35%, mainly due to the complete
retardation form of the electric dipole multipole. However, the contribution of
the next higher multipoles (e.g. magnetic quadrupole) to the cross section is
negligible. This makes the contribution of relativity and higher-order
multipoles to the quantum interference induced shifts a minor effect, even for

concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of its backbone: stochastic
gradient descent (SGD). Recent approaches have been proposed to ensure the
robustness of distributed SGD against adversarial (Byzantine) workers sending
poisoned gradients during the training phase. Some of these approaches have
been proven Byzantine-resilient: they ensure the convergence of SGD despite the
presence of a minority of adversarial workers.
  We show in this paper that convergence is not enough. In high dimension $d
\gg 1$, an adver\-sary can build on the loss function's non-convexity to make
SGD converge to ineffective models. More precisely, we bring to light that
existing Byzantine-resilient schemes leave a margin of poisoning of
$\Omega\left(f(d)\right)$, where $f(d)$ increases at least like $\sqrt{d~}$.
Based on this leeway, we build a simple attack, and experimentally show its
strong to utmost effectivity on CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
  We introduce Bulyan, and prove it significantly reduces the attackers leeway
to a narrow $O( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d~}})$ bound. We empirically show that Bulyan
does not suffer the fragility of existing aggregation rules and, at a
reasonable cost in terms of required batch size, achieves convergence as if
only non-Byzantine gradients had been used to update the model.

effective so far, but always assuming perfectly functioning workers. In
practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by
hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We
introduce \emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of
two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first
is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers.
Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts
as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt
the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by
adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We
prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of
asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We
evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead
with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that
Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does
induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically
and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of
Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers.
Interestingly, we also empirically observe that the dampening component is
interesting in its own right for it enables to build an SGD algorithm that
outperforms alternative staleness-aware asynchronous competitors in
environments with honest workers.

kernel, is a highly ill-posed problem. The problem can be solved in two parts:
i) estimate a blur kernel from the blurry image, and ii) given estimated blur
kernel, de-convolve blurry input to restore the target image. In this paper, we
propose a graph-based blind image deblurring algorithm by interpreting an image
patch as a signal on a weighted graph. Specifically, we first argue that a
skeleton image---a proxy that retains the strong gradients of the target but
smooths out the details---can be used to accurately estimate the blur kernel
and has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution. Then, we design a
reweighted graph total variation (RGTV) prior that can efficiently promote a
bi-modal edge weight distribution given a blurry patch. Further, to analyze
RGTV in the graph frequency domain, we introduce a new weight function to
represent RGTV as a graph $l_1$-Laplacian regularizer. This leads to a graph
spectral filtering interpretation of the prior with desirable properties,
including robustness to noise and blur, strong piecewise smooth (PWS) filtering
and sharpness promotion. Minimizing a blind image deblurring objective with
RGTV results in a non-convex non-differentiable optimization problem. We
leverage the new graph spectral interpretation for RGTV to design an efficient
algorithm that solves for the skeleton image and the blur kernel alternately.
Specifically for Gaussian blur, we propose a further speedup strategy for blind
Gaussian deblurring using accelerated graph spectral filtering. Finally, with
the computed blur kernel, recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms can be
applied to restore the target image. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm successfully restores latent sharp images and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

$0.5<z<1.8$ in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. Based on the average size
versus stellar-mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies into
Small SFGs (SSFGs), i.e., smaller than average for its mass, and Large SFGs
(LSFGs), i.e., larger than average. We find that, at low masses ($M_{\ast} <
10^{10}M_{\odot}$), the SSFGs generally have nearly flat $\varepsilon$ and
A$_4$ profiles for both edge-on and face-on views, especially at redshifts
$z>1$. Moreover, the median A$_4$ values at all radii are almost zero. In
contrast, the highly-inclined, low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins
generally have monotonically increasing $\varepsilon$ with radius and are
dominated by disky values at intermediate radii. These findings at intermediate
redshifts imply that low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, while low-mass LSFGs
appear to harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotation. At
high masses ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10}M_{\odot}$), highly-inclined SSFGs and LSFGs
both exhibit a general, distinct trend for both $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$
profiles: increasing values with radius at lower radii, reaching maxima at
intermediate radii, and then decreasing values at larger radii. Such a trend is
more prevalent for more massive ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$) galaxies or
those at lower redshifts ($z<1.4$). The distinct trend in $\varepsilon$ and
A$_4$ can be simply explained if galaxies possess all three components: central
bulges, disks in the intermediate regions, and halo-like stellar components in
the outskirts.

two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equations with finite element method. We have
found that when the magnetic field from the chiral helimagnet increases,
vortices appear all at once in all periodic regions. This transition is
different from that under the uniform magnetic field. Under the composite
magnetic field with the oscillating and uniform fields (down-vortices),
vortices antiparallel to the uniform magnetic field disappear. Then, the small
uniform magnetic field easily remove down-vortices.

accuracy in rating prediction, they suffer from several problems including
cold-start, non-transparency, and suboptimal recommendation for local users or
items. In this paper, we employ textual review information with ratings to
tackle these limitations. Firstly, we apply a proposed aspect-aware topic model
(ATM) on the review text to model user preferences and item features from
different aspects, and estimate the aspect importance of a user towards an
item. The aspect importance is then integrated into a novel aspect-aware latent
factor model (ALFM), which learns user's and item's latent factors based on
ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weighted matrix to associate those
latent factors with the same set of aspects discovered by ATM, such that the
latent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally, the overall
rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings, which are
weighted by the corresponding aspect importance. To this end, our model could
alleviate the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability for
recommendation. Besides, an aspect rating is weighted by an aspect importance,
which is dependent on the targeted user's preferences and targeted item's
features. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method can model a user's
preferences on an item more accurately for each user-item pair locally.
Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on 19 datasets from
Amazon and Yelp 2017 Challenge dataset. Results show that our method achieves
significant improvement compared with strong baseline methods, especially for
users with only few ratings. Moreover, our model could interpret the
recommendation results in depth.

precisely, the Klein-Gordon equation is solved in presence of mixed

assumption the magnetic field lines are equipotential, and the charge transfer
between them is determined only by integral Pedersen and Hall conductivities.
The model is constructed as the first approximation in the small parameter
expansion of the solution of the three-dimensional problems of electrical
conductivity. The small parameter is the ratio of Pedersen and field-aligned
conductivities. The space distributions of the Pedersen and Hall conductivities
are calculated using the empirical models IRI, MSISE, IGRF and applied to
construct the maps of the integral conductivities. The parts of the
magnetosphere with high conductivity across the magnetic field lines, namely,
the cusps and the plasma layer are analyzed. It is shown that the connection of
these magnetospheric conductors to the ionosphere in parallel makes the auroral
zones equipotential regions. As a consequence, for the ionospheric electric

contrast to most existing trackers that utilize a bounding box to specify the
tracked target, the proposed framework can extract accurate regions of the
target as tracking outputs. It achieves a better description of the non-rigid
objects and reduces the background pollution for the tracking model.
Furthermore, our model has several unique features. First, a tailored fully
convolutional neural network (TFCN) is developed to model the local saliency
prior for a given image region, which not only provides the pixel-wise outputs
but also integrates the semantic information. Second, a novel multi-scale
multi-region mechanism is proposed to generate local saliency maps that
effectively consider visual perceptions with different spatial layouts and
scale variations. Subsequently, local saliency maps are fused via a weighted
entropy method, resulting in a final discriminative saliency map. Finally, we
present a non-rigid object tracking algorithm based on the predicted saliency
maps. By utilizing a spatial-temporal consistent saliency map (STCSM), we
conduct target-background classification and use a simple fine-tuning scheme
for online updating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves competitive performance in both saliency detection and
visual tracking, especially outperforming other related trackers on the

to be random provided that the generated statistics violate a Bell inequality.
This way of producing randomness relies only on a minimal set of assumptions
because it is independent of the internal functioning of the devices generating
the random outcomes. In this context it is crucial to understand both
qualitatively and quantitatively how the three fundamental quantities --
entanglement, non-locality and randomness -- relate to each other. To explore
these relationships, we consider the case where repeated (non projective)
measurements are made on the physical systems, each measurement being made on
the post-measurement state of the previous measurement. In this work, we focus
on the following questions: For systems in a given entangled state, how many
nonlocal correlations in a sequence can we obtain by measuring them repeatedly?
And from this generated sequence of non-local correlations, how many random
numbers is it possible to certify? In the standard scenario with a single
measurement in the sequence, it is possible to generate non-local correlations
between two distant observers only and the amount of random numbers is very
limited. Here we show that we can overcome these limitations and obtain any
amount of certified random numbers from an entangled pair of qubit in a pure
state by making sequences of measurements on it. Moreover, the state can be
arbitrarily weakly entangled. In addition, this certification is achieved by
near-maximal violation of a particular Bell inequality for each measurement in
the sequence. We also present numerical results giving insight on the
resistance to imperfections and on the importance of the strength of the
measurements in our scheme.

and Papoutsellis [1], provides an efficient new approach for solving fully
nonlinear water-wave problems over arbitrary bathymetry. In HCMT, heavy use is
made of the roots of a local, water-wave dispersion relation with varying
parameter, which have to be calculated at every horizontal position and every
time instant. Thus, fast and accurate calculation of these roots, valid for all
possible values of the varying parameter, are of fundamental importance. In
this paper, new, semi-explicit and highly accurate root-finding formulae are
derived, especially for the roots corresponding to evanescent modes. The
derivation is based on the successive application of a Picard-type iteration
and the Householder's root finding method. Explicit approximate formulae of
very good accuracy are obtained, which are adequate to support HCMT for many
types of applications. In most demanding cases, e.g. very steep, deep-water
waves, machine-accurate determination of the required roots is achieved by no
more than three iterations, using the explicit forms as initial values.
Exploiting this root-finding procedure in the HCMT, results in an efficient,
numerical solver able to treat fully nonlinear water waves over arbitrary
bathymetry. Applications to demanding nonlinear problems demonstrate the
efficiency and the robustness of the present approach.

properties of non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique phases with no
Hermitian counterparts. However, no systematic understanding in analogy with
the periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors has been
achieved. In this paper, we develop a coherent framework of topological phases
of non-Hermitian systems. After elucidating the physical meaning and the
mathematical definition of non-Hermitian topological phases, we start with
one-dimensional lattices, which exhibit topological phases with no Hermitian
counterparts and are found to be characterized by an integer topological
winding number even with no symmetry constraint, reminiscent of the quantum
Hall insulator in Hermitian systems. A system with a nonzero winding number,
which is experimentally measurable from the wave-packet dynamics, is shown to
be robust against disorder, a phenomenon observed in the Hatano-Nelson model
with asymmetric hopping amplitudes. We also unveil a novel bulk-edge
correspondence that features an infinite number of (quasi-)edge modes. We then
apply the K-theory to systematically classify all the non-Hermitian topological
phases in the Altland-Zirnbauer classes in all dimensions. The obtained
periodic table unifies time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, leading to
highly nontrivial predictions such as the absence of non-Hermitian topological
phases in two dimensions. We provide concrete examples for all the nontrivial
non-Hermitian AZ classes in zero and one dimensions. In particular, we identify
a Z2 topological index for arbitrary quantum channels. Our work lays the
cornerstone for a unified understanding of the role of topology in
non-Hermitian systems.

the torus instability, so we suggest that the torus instability drove the
eruption.

metric structures are known to exist in several settings, no terminal spanner
or embedding with distortion close to 1, i.e., $t=1+\epsilon$ for some small

  Here we devise such terminal metric structures for {\em doubling} metrics,
and show that essentially any metric structure with distortion $1+\epsilon$ and
size $s(|X|)$ has its terminal counterpart, with distortion $1+O(\epsilon)$ and
size $s(|K|)+1$. In particular, for any doubling metric on $n$ points, a set of
$k=o(n)$ terminals, and constant $0<\epsilon<1$, there exists:
  (1) A spanner with stretch $1+\epsilon$ for pairs in $K\times X$, with
$n+o(n)$ edges.

with label size $\approx \log k$.

calculations. On lowering pressure, the rhombohedral transition $Im\bar{3}m
\rightarrow R3m$ is expected, with hydrogen bond desymmetrization and
occurrence of trigonal lattice distortion. In hydrostatic conditions we find
that, contrary to what suggested in some recent experiments, if the
rhombohedral distortion exists it affects mainly the hydrogen-bonds, whereas
the resulting cell distortion is minimal. We estimate that the occurrence of a
stress anisotropy of approximately $10\%$ could explain this discrepancy.
Assuming hydrostatic conditions, we calculate the critical pressure at which
the rhombohedral transition occurs. Quantum and anharmonic effects, which are
relevant in this system, are included at nonperturbative level with the
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA). Within this
approach, we determine the transition pressure by calculating the free energy
Hessian. We find that quantum anharmonic effects are responsible for a strong
reduction of the critical pressure with respect to the one obtained with the
classical harmonic approach. Moreover, we observe a prominent isotope effect,
as we estimate higher pressure transition for D${}_3$S than for H${}_3$S.
Finally, within SSCHA we calculate the anharmonic phonon spectral functions in
the $Im\bar{3}m$ phase. The strong anharmonicity of the system is confirmed by
the occurrence of very large anharmonic broadenings leading to complex
non-Lorentzian line shapes. However, for the vibrational spectra at zone
center, accessible e.g. by infrared spectroscopy, the broadenings are very
small (linewidth at most around 2~meV) and anharmonic phonon quasiparticles are
well defined.

  2. That the encoding, taken alone without auxiliary data, cannot be reversed

the point-, factor-, space groups, site symmetries, and Wyckoff positions. The
protocol determines a system-specific mapping tolerance that yields symmetry
operations entirely commensurate with fundamental crystallographic principles.
The self consistent tolerance characterizes the effective spatial resolution of
the reported atomic positions. The approach is compared with the most used
programs and is successfully validated against the space group information
provided for over 54,000 entries in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database.
Subsequently, a complete symmetry analysis is applied to all 1.7$+$ million
entries of the AFLOW data repository. The AFLOW-SYM package has been
implemented in, and made available for, public use through the automated,
$\textit{ab-initio}$ framework AFLOW.

chemistry occurring at the surfaces of the dust grains. To describe the
complexity of the chemistry, various numerical models have been constructed. In
most of these models, the grains are described by a single size of 0.1$\mu$m.
We study the impact on the abundances of many species observed in the cold
cores by considering several grain sizes in the Nautilus multi-grain model. We
used grain sizes with radii in the range of $0.005\mu$m to $0.25\mu$m. We
sampled this range in many bins. We used the previously published, MRN and WD
grain size distributions to calculate the number density of grains in each bin.
Other parameters such as the grain surface temperature or the
cosmic-ray-induced desorption rates also vary with grain sizes. We present the
abundances of various molecules in the gas phase and also on the dust surface
at different time intervals during the simulation. We present a comparative
study of results obtained using the single grain and the multi-grain models. We
also compare our results with the observed abundances in TMC-1 and L134N
clouds. We show that the grain size, the grain size dependent surface
temperature and the peak surface temperature induced by cosmic ray collisions,
play key roles in determining the ice and the gas phase abundances of various
molecules. We also show that the differences between the MRN and the WD models
are crucial for better fitting the observed abundances in different regions in
the ISM. We show that the small grains play a very important role in the
enrichment of the gas phase with the species which are mainly formed on the
grain surface, as non-thermal desorption induced by collisions of cosmic ray
particles is very efficient on the small grains.

propose learn-to-route, a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution.
Specifically, we first construct a graph-like structure from trajectories as
the routing infrastructure. Second, we enable trajectory-based routing given an
arbitrary (source, destination) pair.
  In the first step, given a road network and a collection of trajectories, we
propose a trajectory-based clustering method that identifies regions in a road
network. If a pair of regions are connected by trajectories, we maintain the
paths used by these trajectories and learn a routing preference for travel
between the regions. As trajectories are skewed and sparse, many region pairs
are not connected by trajectories. We thus transfer routing preferences from
region pairs with sufficient trajectories to such region pairs and then use the
transferred preferences to identify paths between the regions. In the second
step, we exploit the above graph-like structure to achieve a comprehensive
trajectory-based routing solution. Empirical studies with two substantial
trajectory data sets offer insight into the proposed solution, indicating that
it is practical. A comparison with a leading routing service offers evidence
that the paper's proposal is able to enhance routing quality.

test cases is hindered by design documentation that is either lacking,

method in such situations. However, the efficiency of this testing approach
strongly depends on the method, the documentation of explored parts of a
system, the organization and distribution of work among individual testers on a
team, and the minimization of potential (very probable) duplicities in
performed tests. In this paper, we present a framework for replacing and
automating a portion of these tasks. A screen-flow-based model of the tested
system is incrementally reconstructed during the exploratory testing process by
tracking testers' activities. With additional metadata, the model serves for an
automated navigation process for a tester. Compared with the exploratory
testing approach, which is manually performed in two case studies, the proposed
framework allows the testers to explore a greater extent of the tested system
and enables greater detection of the defects present in the system. The results
show that the time efficiency of the testing process improved with framework
support. This efficiency can be increased by team-based navigational strategies
that are implemented within the proposed framework, which is documented by
another case study presented in this paper.

anisotropic domain are presented. These anisotropic solutions are obtained by
guided minimal deformations over a self gravitating isotropic system. When the
isotropic and the anisotropic sector interacts in a purely gravitational
manner, the conditions to decouple both sectors by means of the minimal
geometric deformation approach are satisfied. Hence the anisotropic field
equations are isolated resulting a more treatable set. The simplicity of the
equations allows one to manipulate the anisotropies that can be implemented in
a systematic way to obtain different realistic models for anisotropic
configurations. Later on, observational effects of such anisotropies when
measuring the redshift are discussed. To conclude, the application of the
method over anisotropic solutions is generalized. In this manner, different
anisotropic sectors can be isolated of each other and modeled in a simple and
systematic way. Besides, a generic property of the minimal geometric
deformation approach, its noncommutativity, is discussed. This property
duplicates the solutions obtained through this approach; anisotropies applied
in the reversed order give different physically acceptable configurations.

defined. In addition, to optimize the test set from an economic viewpoint, the
priorities of the various parts of the system model under test must be defined.
Using this prioritization, the test cases exercise the high priority parts of
the system under test more intensely than those with low priority. Evidence
from the literature and our observations confirm that finding a universal
algorithm that produces an optimal test set for all test coverage and test set
optimality criteria is a challenging task. Moreover, for different individual

we present a path-based strategy to perform optimal test selection. The
strategy first employs a set of current algorithms to generate test sets; then,
it assesses the optimality of each test set by the selected criteria, and
finally, chooses the optimal test set. The experimental results confirm the

varied by the required test coverage level, the size of the priority parts of

to resort to a highly intricate approximate inference procedure. The present
paper shows that topic modeling with pre-trained word embedding vectors can be
viewed as implementing a neighborhood aggregation algorithm where messages are
passed through a network defined over words. From the network view of topic
models, nodes correspond to words in a document and edges correspond to either
a relationship describing co-occurring words in a document or a relationship
describing the same word in the corpus. The network view allows us to extend
the model to include supervisory signals, incorporate pre-trained word

the top-k minimal total costs) from a given source to a given destination,
which must visit a number of vertices with specific vertex categories (e.g.,
gas stations, restaurants, and shopping malls) in a particular order (e.g.,
visiting gas stations before restaurants and then shopping malls).
  To efficiently find the top-k optimal sequenced routes, we propose two
algorithms PruningKOSR and StarKOSR. In PruningKOSR, we define a dominance
relationship between two partially-explored routes. The partially-explored
routes that can be dominated by other partially-explored routes are postponed
being extended, which leads to a smaller searching space and thus improves
efficiency. In StarKOSR, we further improve the efficiency by extending routes
in an A* manner. With the help of a judiciously designed heuristic estimation
that works for general graphs, the cost of partially explored routes to the
destination can be estimated such that the qualified complete routes can be
found early. In addition, we demonstrate the high extensibility of the proposed
algorithms by incorporating Hop Labeling, an effective label indexing technique
for shortest path queries, to further improve efficiency. Extensive experiments
on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly outperform the baseline method. Furthermore, when k=1, StarKOSR

commonly processed ""data parallel"" distributed across many nodes. Each node's
contribution to the overall gradient is summed using a global allreduce. This
allreduce is the single communication and thus scalability bottleneck for most
machine learning workloads. We observe that frequently, many gradient values
are (close to) zero, leading to sparse of sparsifyable communications. To
exploit this insight, we analyze, design, and implement a set of
communication-efficient protocols for sparse input data, in conjunction with
efficient machine learning algorithms which can leverage these primitives. Our
communication protocols generalize standard collective operations, by allowing
processes to contribute arbitrary sparse input data vectors. Our generic
communication library, SparCML, extends MPI to support additional features,
such as non-blocking (asynchronous) operations and low-precision data
representations. As such, SparCML and its techniques will form the basis of

  Guarantee on the Expected Gains-From-Trade",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The seminal impossibility result of Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) states
that for bilateral trade, there is no mechanism that is individually rational
(IR), incentive compatible (IC), weakly budget balanced, and efficient. This
has led follow-up work on two-sided trade settings to weaken the efficiency
requirement and consider approximately efficient simple mechanisms, while still
demanding the other properties. The current state-of-the-art of such mechanisms
for two-sided markets can be categorized as giving one (but not both) of the
following two types of approximation guarantees on the gains from trade: a
constant ex-ante guarantee, measured with respect to the second-best efficiency
benchmark, or an asymptotically optimal ex-post guarantee, measured with
respect to the first-best efficiency benchmark. Here the second-best efficiency
benchmark refers to the highest gains from trade attainable by any IR, IC and
weakly budget balanced mechanism, while the first-best efficiency benchmark
refers to the maximum gains from trade (attainable by the VCG mechanism, which
is not weakly budget balanced).
  In this paper, we construct simple mechanisms for double-auction and matching
markets that simultaneously achieve both types of guarantees: these are ex-post
IR, Bayesian IC, and ex-post weakly budget balanced mechanisms that 1) ex-ante
guarantee a constant fraction of the gains from trade of the second-best, and
2) ex-post guarantee a realization-dependent fraction of the gains from trade
of the first-best, such that this realization-dependent fraction converges to 1
(full efficiency) as the market grows large.

which can sometimes be quite complex, we do not appear to observe intricate
cooperative interactions. A key question for the origin of life, is then how
can molecular cooperation first arise in an abiotic system prior to the
emergence of biological replication. We postulate that selection at the
molecular level is a driving force behind the complexification of chemical
systems, particularly during the origins of life. In the theory of multilevel
selection the two selective forces are: within-group and between-group, where
the former tends to favor ""selfish"" replication of individuals and the latter
favor cooperation between individuals enhancing the replication of the group as
a whole. These forces can be quantified using the Price equation, which is a
standard tool used in evolutionary biology to quantify evolutionary change. Our
central claim is that replication and heredity in chemical systems are subject
to selection, and quantifiable using the multilevel Price equation. We
demonstrate this using the Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain computer
model, describing simple protocell composed out of molecules and its
replication, which respectively analogue to the group and the individuals. In
contrast to previous treatments of this model, we treat the lipid molecules
themselves as replicating individuals and the protocells they form as groups of
individuals. Our goal is to demonstrate how evolutionary biology tools and
concepts can be applied in chemistry and we suggest that molecular cooperation
may arise as a result of group selection. Further, the biological relation of
parent-progeny is proposed to be analogue to the reactant-product relation in
chemistry, thus allowing for tools from evolutionary biology to be applied to
chemistry and would deepen the connection between chemistry and biology.

rigidity $\kappa$. Similarly, the exponent $\beta$ for the scaling of $\tau$
with polymer length $N$, $\tau \sim N^\beta$, increases with increasing
$\kappa$ as well as with increasing $f_d$. By comparing waiting times between
semiflexible and fully flexible polymers we show that for realistic $f_d$
translocation dynamics is to a large extent, but not completely, determined by
the polymer's elastic length measured in number of Kuhn segments $N_{\rm
Kuhn}$. Unlike in driven translocation of flexible polymers, friction related
to the polymer segment on the trans side has a considerable effect on the
resulting dynamics. This friction is intermittently reduced by buckling of the
polymer segment in the vicinity of the pore opening on the trans side. We show
that in the experimentally relevant regime, where viscosity is higher than in
computer simulation models, the probability for this buckling increases with
increasing $f_d$, giving rise to larger contribution to trans side friction at
small $f_d$. Similarly to flexible polymers, we find significant center of mass
diffusion of the cis side polymer segment. This speeds up translocation, which
effect is larger for smaller $f_d$. However, this speed-up is smaller than the
slowing down due to the trans side friction. At large enough $N_{\rm Kuhn}$,
the roles can be seen to be reversed and the dynamics of flexible polymers be
reached. However, for example, polymers used in translocation experiments of
DNA, are elastically so short, that the finite-length dynamics outlined here
applies.

domains where data can be naturally interpreted in terms of complex numbers.
However, several analytical properties of the complex domain (e.g.,
holomorphicity) make the design of CVNNs a more challenging task than their
real counterpart. In this paper, we consider the problem of flexible activation
functions (AFs) in the complex domain, i.e., AFs endowed with sufficient
degrees of freedom to adapt their shape given the training data. While this
problem has received considerable attention in the real case, a very limited
literature exists for CVNNs, where most activation functions are generally
developed in a split fashion (i.e., by considering the real and imaginary parts
of the activation separately) or with simple phase-amplitude techniques.
Leveraging over the recently proposed kernel activation functions (KAFs), and
related advances in the design of complex-valued kernels, we propose the first
fully complex, non-parametric activation function for CVNNs, which is based on
a kernel expansion with a fixed dictionary that can be implemented efficiently
on vectorized hardware. Several experiments on common use cases, including
prediction and channel equalization, validate our proposal when compared to
real-valued neural networks and CVNNs with fixed activation functions.

  Compute Chemical Potentials of Dense Fluids",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many popular methods for the calculation of chemical potentials rely on the
insertion of test particles into the target system. In the case of liquids and
liquid mixtures, this procedure increases in difficulty upon increasing density
or concentration, and the use of sophisticated enhanced sampling techniques
becomes inevitable. In this work we propose an alternative strategy, spatially
resolved thermodynamic integration, or SPARTIAN for short. Here, molecules are
described with atomistic resolution in a simulation subregion, and as ideal gas
particles in a larger reservoir. All molecules are free to diffuse between
subdomains adapting their resolution on the fly. To enforce a uniform density
profile across the simulation box, a single-molecule external potential is
computed, applied, and identified with the difference in chemical potential
between the two resolutions. Since the reservoir is represented as an ideal gas
bath, this difference exactly amounts to the excess chemical potential of the
target system. The present approach surpasses the high density/concentration
limitation of particle insertion methods because the ideal gas molecules
entering the target system region spontaneously adapt to the local environment.
The ideal gas representation contributes negligibly to the computational cost
of the simulation, thus allowing one to make use of large reservoirs at minimal
expenses. The method has been validated by computing excess chemical potentials
for pure Lennard-Jones liquids and mixtures, SPC and SPC/E liquid water, and
aqueous solutions of sodium chloride. The reported results well reproduce
literature data for these systems.

at separate sites and depths, which means they are subject to different muon

($\sim$300 m.w.e.) corresponding to a mean muon energy of

models have photon spheres only if a certain parameter $M_0$ that characterizes

algorithms based on the identity of the users spreading the news, as well as
the words appearing in the titles and descriptions of the linked articles, are
able to identify a large portion of fake or misleading news, while incurring
only very low (<1%) false positive rates for mainstream websites. We believe

radiation observed at frequencies in the range $\approx 10$-60 GHz. AME was
first detected in 1996 and recognised as an additional component of emission in
1997. Since then, AME has been observed by a range of experiments and in a
variety of environments. AME is spatially correlated with far-IR thermal dust
emission but cannot be explained by synchrotron or free-free emission
mechanisms, and is far in excess of the emission contributed by thermal dust
emission with the power-law opacity consistent with the observed emission at
sub-mm wavelengths. Polarization observations have shown that AME is very
weakly polarized ($\lesssim 1$%). The most natural explanation for AME is
rotational emission from ultra-small dust grains (""spinning dust""), first
postulated in 1957. Magnetic dipole radiation from thermal fluctuations in the
magnetization of magnetic grain materials may also be contributing to the AME,
particularly at higher frequencies ($\gtrsim 50$ GHz). AME is also an important
foreground for Cosmic Microwave Background analyses. This paper presents a
review and the current state-of-play in AME research, which was discussed in an
AME workshop held at ESTEC, The Netherlands, June 2016.

the local Lyapunov exponents results to be an unsymmetrical uniform function in
a proper interval of variation. From this PDF, we determine the relationship
between average and maximum Lyapunov exponents, and the longitudinal velocity
correlation function. This link, which in turn leads to the closure of von
K\`arm\`an-Howarth and Corrsin equations, agrees with results of previous
works, supporting the proposed PDF calculation, at least for the purposes of
the energy cascade main effect estimation. Furthermore, through the property
that the Lyapunov vectors tend to align the direction of the maximum growth
rate of trajectories distance, we obtain the link between maximum and average
Lyapunov exponents in line with the previous results. To validate the proposed
theoretical results, we present different numerical simulations whose results
justify the hypotheses of the present analysis.

to the common belief, the Jensen inequality does not directly support the JE as
a nonequilibrium result. Jarzynski's microscopic treatment of the inclusive
energy considers only the external work d_eE_k but neglects the ubiquitous
change d_iE_k due to external-internal force imbalance, though d_iE_k's are
present even in a reversible process as we show. Because of this neglect, no
thermodynamic force necessary for dissipation is allowed. Thus the JE has no
built-in irreversibility, despite a time-dependent work protocol. We support
our claim by an explicit calculation, which shows that <R>_0 > delta(F) even
for a reversible process for which <R> = delta(F). This also confirms that <R>

oxide degradation in Si MOSFETs, very few precursors have been identified for
SiC MOSFETs. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that gate oxide
degradation precursors used in Si MOSFETs: a) threshold voltage, b) gate
plateau voltage and c) gate plateau time, can also be used as precursors for
SiC MOSFETS. Moreover, all three precursors are found to exhibit a simultaneous
increasing trend (during the stress time) leading to an increase in on-state
loss, switching loss and switching time of the SiC MOSFET. The existing studies
of gate oxide degradation mechanisms in SiC MOSFETs, and their effects on
threshold voltage and mobility were extended to correlate a variation of all
three precursors using analytical expressions. The increasing trends of
precursors were experimentally confirmed by inducing gate oxide degradation in
commercial SiC MOSFET samples.

that there are some singular points in the bulk band across which the Bloch

the contribution is nearly zero. These singular points associated with zero

evaluated, is a multipartite measure of entanglement as opposed to more
commonly used bipartite measures. Consequently, we obtain analytic expression
of the measure for finite-size systems and show that it can be used to obtain
critical exponents via finite-size scaling with great accuracy for the Ising
universality class. We also calculate an analytic expression for the isotropic

level-crossing points. The critical exponent for the isotropic transition is
obtained exactly from an analytic expression for global entanglement in the
thermodynamic limit. Next, the general behavior of the measure is calculated in
the thermodynamic limit considering the important role of symmetries for this
limit. The so-called oscillatory transition in the ferromagnetic regime can
only be characterized by the thermodynamic limit where global entanglement is
shown to be zero on the transition curve. Finally, the anisotropic transition
is explored where it is shown that global entanglement exhibits an interesting
behavior in the finite-size limit. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that
global entanglement shows a cusp singularity across the Ising and anisotropic

It is concluded that global entanglement, despite its relative simplicity, can
be used to identify all the rich structure of the ground-state Heisenberg

In an offline phase, a set of trajectories is precomputed with a high-accuracy
ODE solver for a selected set of parameter samples, and used to train a kernel
model which predicts the next point in the trajectory as a function of the last
one. This model is cheap to evaluate, and it is used in an online phase for new
parameter samples to provide a good initialization point for the nonlinear
solver of the implicit integrator. The accuracy of the surrogate reflects into
a reduction of the number of iterations until convergence of the solver, thus
providing an overall speedup of the full simulation. Interestingly, in addition
to providing an acceleration, the accuracy of the solution is maintained, since
the ODE solver is still used to guarantee the required precision. Although the
method can be applied to a large variety of solvers and different ODEs, we will
present in details its use with the Implicit Euler method for the solution of

imposed on the Lagrangian and broken only spontaneously at high scales, leading
to a mixing between chiral and vectorlike fields that allows to solve the

the index N2 (log([NII]6583/Halpha)) and the Halpha flux. These two quantities
are commonly employed as proxies for gas-phase metallicity and star formation
rate (SFR), respectively. Thus, the observed N2 to Halpha relation may reflect
the existence of an anti-correlation between the metallicity of the gas forming
stars and the SFR it induces. Such an anti-correlation is to be expected if
variable external metal-poor gas fuels the star-formation process.
Alternatively, it can result from the contamination of the star-forming gas by
stellar winds and SNe, provided that intense outflows drive most of the metals
out of the star-forming regions. We also explore the possibility that the
observed anti-correlation is due to variations in the physical conditions of
the emitting gas, other than metallicity. Using alternative methods to compute
metallicity, as well as previous observations of HII regions and
photoionization models, we conclude that this possibility is unlikely. The
radial gradient of metallicity characterizing disk galaxies does not produce
the correlation either.

solved backward in time. A particular situation is developed when the System
Operator (SO) uses consumption of the previous interval as the
household-specific baseline for the DR program. It is found that a rational
consumer alters the baseline in order to increase the well-being when there is
an economic incentive. As results, whether the incentive is lower than the
retail price, the user shifts his load requirement to the baseline setting
period. On the other hand, if the incentive is greater than the regular energy
price, the optimal decision is that the user spends the maximum possible energy
in the baseline setting period and reduces the consumption at the PTR time.
This consumer behavior produces more energy consumption in total considering
all periods. In addition, the user with high uncertainty level in his energy
pattern should spend less energy than a predictable consumer when the incentive

group $G$. By definition, $Sph_G := IndCoh(LS_G(S^2))$ consists of ind-coherent
sheaves of the stack of $G$-local systems on the $2$-sphere $S^2$. The
$3$-dimensional version of the pair of pants endows $Sph_G$ with an
$E_3$-monoidal structure. More generally, for an algebraic stack $Y$
(satisfying some mild conditions) and $n \geq -1$, we can look at the
$E_{n+1}$-monoidal DG category $Sph(Y,n) := IndCoh_0((Y^{S^n})^\wedge_Y)$,
where $IndCoh_0$ is the sheaf theory introduced in [AG2] and [centerH]. % The
case of $Sph_G$ is recovered by setting $Y =BG$ and $n=2$.
  The cobordism hypothesis associates to $Sph(Y,n)$ an $(n+1)$-dimensional
TQFT, whose value of a manifold $M^d$ of dimension $d \leq n+1$ (possibly with
boundary) is given by the {topological chiral homology} $\int_{M^d} Sph(Y,n)$.
% In this paper, we compute such homology (in virtually all cases): we have the
Stokes style formula $$ \int_{M^d} Sph(Y,n) \simeq IndCoh_0 ( (Y^{\partial(M^d
\times D^{n+1-d})})^\wedge_{Y^M} ) , $$ where the formal completion is
constructed using the obvious projection $\partial(M^d \times D^{n+1-d}) \to
M^d$.
  The most interesting instance of this formula is for $Sph_G \simeq
Sph(BG,2)$, the original spherical category, and $X$ a Riemann surface. In this
case, we obtain a monoidal equivalence $\int_X Sph_G \simeq
H(LS_G^{Betti}(X))$, where $LS_G^{Betti}(X)$ is the stack of $G$-local systems
on the topological space underlying $X$ and $H$ is the sheaf theory introduced
in [centerH].

for learning data distributions. A popular GAN formulation is based on the use
of Wasserstein distance as a metric between probability distributions.
Unfortunately, minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the data
distribution and the generative model distribution is a computationally
challenging problem as its objective is non-convex, non-smooth, and even hard
to compute. In this work, we show that obtaining gradient information of the
smoothed Wasserstein GAN formulation, which is based on regularized Optimal
Transport (OT), is computationally effortless and hence one can apply first
order optimization methods to minimize this objective. Consequently, we
establish theoretical convergence guarantee to stationarity for a proposed
class of GAN optimization algorithms. Unlike the original non-smooth
formulation, our algorithm only requires solving the discriminator to
approximate optimality. We apply our method to learning MNIST digits as well as
CIFAR-10images. Our experiments show that our method is computationally
efficient and generates images comparable to the state of the art algorithms

sequencing experiments in the public domain, the use of meta-analysis methods
increases. In these experiments, where the sample size is often limited,
meta-analysis offers the possibility to considerably enhance the statistical
power and give more accurate results. For those purposes, it combines either
effect sizes or results of single studies in a appropriate manner. R packages
metaMA and metaRNASeq perform meta-analysis on microarray and NGS data,
respectively. They are not interchangeable as they rely on statistical modeling
specific to each technology.
  Results: SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta-Analysis for Gene EXPression) integrates
metaMA and metaRNAseq packages into Galaxy. We aim to propose a unified way to
carry out meta-analysis of gene expression data, while taking care of their
specificities. We have developed this tool suite to analyse microarray data
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database or custom data from affymetrix
microarrays. These data are then combined to carry out meta-analysis using
metaMA package. SMAGEXP also offers to combine raw read counts from Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments using DESeq2 and metaRNASeq package. In
both cases, key values, independent from the technology type, are reported to
judge the quality of the meta-analysis. These tools are available on the Galaxy

  Conclusion: The use of Galaxy offers an easy-to-use gene expression

based on quark and gluonic fields, not squarks nor gluinos. However, its
hadronic eigensolutions conform to a representation of superconformal algebra,
reflecting the underlying conformal symmetry of chiral QCD and its Pauli matrix
representation. The eigensolutions of superconformal algebra provide a unified
Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and tetraquarks in the same 4-plet
representation with a universal Regge slope. The pion $q \bar q$ eigenstate has
zero mass for $m_q=0.$ The superconformal relations also can be extended to
heavy-light quark mesons and baryons. The combined approach of light-front
holography and superconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of
the QCD mass scale and color confinement. A key observation is the remarkable
dAFF principle which shows how a mass scale can appear in the Hamiltonian and
the equations of motion while retaining the conformal symmetry of the action.
When one applies the dAFF procedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\kappa$
appears which determines universal Regge slopes, hadron masses in the absence
of the Higgs coupling, and the mass parameter underlying the form of the
nonperturbative QCD running coupling: $\alpha_s(Q^2) \propto \exp{-{Q^2/4
\kappa^2}}$, in agreement with the effective charge determined from
measurements of the Bjorken sum rule. The mass scale $\kappa$ underlying hadron
masses can be connected to the parameter $\Lambda_{\overline {MS}}$ in the QCD
running coupling by matching its predicted nonperturbative form to the
perturbative QCD regime. One also obtains predictions for spacelike and
timelike hadronic form factors, structure functions, distribution amplitudes,
and transverse momentum distributions.

properties by external stimulus. Based on first-principles calculations and
theoretical consideration we show that all-oxide heterostructures incorporating

based on classic Min-Min Algorithm. The RAMM Algorithm selects shortest

  Adversarial Attacks","Accepted in AAAI 2018 (8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural network (DNN) architecture based models have high expressive
power and learning capacity. However, they are essentially a black box method
since it is not easy to mathematically formulate the functions that are learned
within its many layers of representation. Realizing this, many researchers have
started to design methods to exploit the drawbacks of deep learning based
algorithms questioning their robustness and exposing their singularities. In
this paper, we attempt to unravel three aspects related to the robustness of
DNNs for face recognition: (i) assessing the impact of deep architectures for
face recognition in terms of vulnerabilities to attacks inspired by commonly
observed distortions in the real world that are well handled by shallow
learning methods along with learning based adversaries; (ii) detecting the
singularities by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden
layers of deep networks; and (iii) making corrections to the processing
pipeline to alleviate the problem. Our experimental evaluation using multiple
open-source DNN-based face recognition networks, including OpenFace and
VGG-Face, and two publicly available databases (MEDS and PaSC) demonstrates
that the performance of deep learning based face recognition algorithms can
suffer greatly in the presence of such distortions. The proposed method is also
compared with existing detection algorithms and the results show that it is
able to detect the attacks with very high accuracy by suitably designing a
classifier using the response of the hidden layers in the network. Finally, we
present several effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact of adversarial
attacks and improve the overall robustness of DNN-based face recognition.

better understand brain organization. Specifically, accounting for knowledge of
anatomical pathways connecting brain regions should lead to desirable outcomes
such as increased accuracy in functional brain network estimates and greater
reproducibility of topological features across scanning sessions. Despite the
clear merits, major challenges persist in integrative analyses including an
incomplete understanding of the structure-function relationship and
inaccuracies in mapping anatomical structures due to deficiencies in existing
imaging technology. Clearly advanced network modeling tools are needed to
appropriately incorporate anatomical structure in constructing brain functional
networks. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian graphical modeling
approach that estimates the functional networks via sparse precision matrices
whose degree of edge-specific shrinkage is informed by anatomical structure and
an independent baseline component. The approach flexibly identifies functional
connections supported by structural connectivity knowledge. This enables robust
brain network estimation even in the presence of mis-specified anatomical
knowledge, while accommodating heterogeneity in the structure-function
relationship. We implement the approach via an efficient optimization algorithm
yielding maximum a posteriori estimates. Extensive numerical studies reveal the
clear advantages of our approach over competing methods in accurately
estimating brain functional connectivity, even when the anatomical knowledge is
mis-specified. An application of the approach to the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study reveals gender based connectivity
differences across multiple age groups, and higher reproducibility in the
estimation of network metrics compared to alternative methods.

from integration of partial derivatives of alchemical Hamiltonians or from
perturbation-based estimators including free energy perturbation (FEP) and
acceptance ratio methods. With FEP or exponential averaging, researchers tend
to only sample MM states and calculate single point energy to get the free
energy estimates. In this case the sample size hysteresis arises and the
convergence is determined by bias elimination rather than variance
minimization. Various criteria are proposed to evaluate the convergence issue
and numerical studies are reported. It has been found that criteria including
variance of distribution, effective sample size, information entropies and so
on can be used and they are variance-of-distribution-dependent. However, no
theoretical interpretation is presented. In this paper we present theoretical
interpretations to dig the underlying statistical nature behind the problem.
The convergence criteria are proven to be related with variance of distribution
in Gaussian approximated Exponential averaging. Further, we prove that these
estimators are nonlinearly dependent on the variance of the free energy
estimate. As these estimators are often orders of magnitude overestimated, the
variance of the FEP estimate is orders of magnitude underestimated. Hence,
computing this statistical uncertainty is meaningless. In numerical calculation
from timeseries data the effective sample size is bounded by 1 and N and thus
the variance of the free energy estimate is proven to be bounded by 0 and 1
(kBT)2 for EXP and 0 and 2 (kBT)2 for BAR, which indicates an inevitable
underestimation. Specifically, the upper bounds for these estimators are
sample-size dependent. The effective sample size is proven to be a function of
the overlap scalar, from which the range of the overlap scalar can also be
derived.

of these operators, and we study the relationship between the fractional

introduce a new concept of fractional derivative of order $\alpha>0$, which is
defined via the fractional integral of first kind. Using an approximate
identity argument, we show that the introduced fractional derivative converges
to the standard derivative in $L^1$ space, as $\alpha\to 0^+$. Several other
properties are studied, like fractional integration by parts, the relationship
between this fractional derivative and the fractional integral of second kind,

equation, we establish an existence and uniqueness result for this model, and

the number, performance, and degree of autonomy and inter-connectivity of

unprecedented scenarios of interdependence. As a consequence, guaranteeing the
persistence-of-identity of individual & collective software systems and
software-backed organisations becomes an important prerequisite toward
sustaining the safety, security, & quality of the computer services supporting
human societies. Resilience is the term used to refer to the ability of a
system to retain its functional and non-functional identity. In this article we
conjecture that a better understanding of resilience may be reached by
decomposing it into ancillary constituent properties, the same way as a better
insight in system dependability was obtained by breaking it down into
sub-properties. 3 of the main sub-properties of resilience proposed here refer
respectively to the ability to perceive environmental changes; understand the
implications introduced by those changes; and plan & enact adjustments intended
to improve the system-environment fit. A fourth property characterises the way
the above abilities manifest themselves in computer systems. The 4 properties
are then analyzed in 3 families of case studies, each consisting of 3 software
systems that embed different resilience methods. Our major conclusion is that
reasoning in terms of resilience sub-properties may help revealing the
characteristics and limitations of classic methods and tools meant to achieve
system and organisational resilience. We conclude by suggesting that our method
may prelude to meta-resilient systems -- systems, that is, able to adjust
optimally their own resilience with respect to changing environmental
conditions.

encouraged the design of rechargeable batteries with higher storage capacities,

specifically boron and carbon nanosheets, have garnered enthusiasm due to their
fascinating electronic, optical, mechanical and chemical properties. Recently,
a hydrogen boride (HB) nanosheet was successfully fabricated showing remarkable
stability and superior physical properties. Motivated by this experimental
study, we used first principle electronic structure calculations to study the
feasibility of this nanosheet to serve as an anode material for Li/Na/Ca/Mg/Al
ion batteries. Most active adsorption sites for single adatoms were evaluated
and next adatoms were gradually inserted into the anode surface accordingly.
The charge transfer, electronic density of sates, storage capacity, structural
stability, open-circuit potential and diffusion energy barriers were explored.
Our theoretical study predicts that HB shows outstanding electrode properties
for Li and Na ion batteries. The intercalation of both Li and Na adatoms into
the HB monolayer can lead to a high identical storage capacity of 1133.8 mAh/g
which is promising compared to the capacities of the traditional anode
materials; such as graphite (372 mAh/g) and TiO2 (200 mAh/g), and other 2D

of Co/Pt for energy efficient optical receiver. Designing a low power optical
receiver for optical-to-electrical signal conversion has proven to be very
challenging. Current day receivers use a photodiode that produces a
photocurrent in response to input optical signals, and power hungry
trans-impedance amplifiers are required to amplify the small photocurrents.
Here, we propose light helicity induced switching of magnetization to overcome
the requirement of photodiodes and subsequent trans-impedance amplification by
sensing the change in magnetization with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).
Magnetization switching of a thin ferromagnet layer using circularly polarized
laser pulses have recently been demonstrated which shows one-to-one
correspondence between light helicity and the magnetization state. We propose
to utilize this phenomena by using digital input dependent circularly polarized
laser pulses to directly switch the magnetization state of a thin Co/Pt
ferromagnet layer at the receiver. The Co/Pt layer is used as the free layer of
an MTJ, the resistance of which is modified by the laser pulses. With the
one-to-one dependence between input data and output magnetization state, the
MTJ resistance is directly converted to digital output signal. Our device to
circuit level simulation results indicate that, HDS based optical receiver
consumes only 0.124 pJ/bit energy, which is much lower than existing
techniques.

The dynamics lead to a mixed phase space where chaotic orbits have a free path
to move along the velocity axis, presenting a normal diffusion behavior.
Depending on the control parameter, one can observe the presence of featured
resonances, known as accelerator modes, that lead to a ballistic growth of
velocity. Through statistical and numerical analysis of the velocity of the
particle, we are able to characterize a transition between the two regimes,
where transport properties were used to characterize the scenario of the
ballistic regime. Also, in an analysis of the probability of an orbit to reach
an accelerator mode as a function of the velocity, we observe a competition
between the normal and ballistic transport in the mid range velocity.

elaborated. On expressing a temporal interval in a multi-dimensional form, via
a direct arithmetic decomposition, both the geometric structure of
4-dimensional spacetime and the physical structure of matter in spacetime can
be derived from the substructure of time. While reviewing this construction,
here we emphasise how the new conceptual picture differs from the more typical
viewpoint in theoretical physics of accounting for the properties of matter by
first postulating entities on top of a given spacetime background or by
geometrically augmenting 4-dimensional spacetime itself. With reference to
historical and philosophical sources we argue that the proposed perspective,
centred on the possible arithmetic forms of time, provides an account for how
the mathematical structures of the theory can relate directly to the physical
