significantly affected by only a small subset of parameter combinations.
Despite forming an important universality class and arising frequently in
practice, formal and systematic explanations of sloppiness are lacking. By
unifying geometric interpretations of sloppiness with Chebyshev approximation
theory, we offer such an explanation, and show how sloppiness can be described
explicitly in terms of model smoothness. Our approach results in universal
bounds on model predictions for classes of smooth models, and our bounds
capture global geometric features that are intrinsic to their model manifolds.
We illustrate these ideas using three disparate models: exponential decay,
reaction rates from an enzyme-catalysed chemical reaction, and an epidemiology
model of an infected population.

many bio-medical signals to detect nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes. One of
the most basic HOS methods is the bispectral estimation, which extracts the
degree of quadratic phase coupling between individual frequency components of a
nonlinear signal. Most of the studies in this direction as applied to ECG
signals are on the conventional, long duration (up to 24 hours) Heart Rate
Variability (HRV) data. We report results of our studies on short duration ECG
data of 60 seconds using power spectral and bispectral parameters. We analyze
60 healthy cases and 60 cases of patients diagnosed with four different heart
diseases, Bundle Branch Block, Cardiomyopathy, Dysrhythmia and Myocardial
Infarction. From the power spectra of these data sets we observe that the pulse
frequency around 1 Hz has maximum power for all normal ECG data while in all
disease cases, the power in the pulse frequency is suppressed and gets
distributed among higher frequencies. The bicoherence indices computed show
that the pulse frequency has strong quadratic phase coupling with a large
number of higher frequencies in healthy cases indicating nonlinearity in the
underlying dynamical processes. The loss or decrease of the phase coupling with
pulse frequency is a clear indicator of abnormal conditions. In specific cases,
bicoherence studies coupled with spectral filter, suggest ECG for Myocardial
Infarction has noisy components while in Dysrhythmia, power is mostly at high
frequencies with strong quadratic coupling indicating much more irregularity
and complexity than normal ECG signals. In addition to serving as indicators
suggestive of abnormal conditions of the heart, the detailed analysis presented
can lead to a wholistic understanding of normal heart dynamics and its
variations during onset of diseases.

directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs, and random bipartite graph with an equal
number of left and right vertices. For such graphs we show that if the edge
connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$ satisfies $n p \ge \log n + k(n)$ with
$k(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, then the adjacency matrix is invertible
with probability approaching one (here $n$ is the number of vertices in the two
former cases and the number of left and right vertices in the latter case).
  If $np \le \log n -k(n)$ then these matrices are invertible with probability
approaching zero, as $n \to \infty$. In the intermediate region, when $np=\log
n + k(n)$, for a bounded sequence $k(n) \in \mathbb{R}$, the event $\Omega_0$
that the adjacency matrix has a zero row or a column and its complement both
have non-vanishing probability. For such choices of $p$ our results show that
conditioned on the event $\Omega_0^c$ the matrices are again invertible with
probability tending to one. This shows that the primary reason for the
non-invertibility of such matrices is the existence of a zero row or a column.
  The bounds on the probability of the invertibility of these matrices are a
consequence of quantitative lower bounds on their smallest singular values.
Combining this with an upper bound on the largest singular value of the
centered version of these matrices we show that the (modified) condition number
is $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ on the event that there is no zero row or column, with large
probability. This matches with von Neumann's prediction about the condition
number of random matrices up to a factor of $n^{o(1)}$, for the entire range of
$p$.

Access (SEEMA) transmission protocol that performs a censoring-type
transmission based on the density of observations using multiple access
channels (MAC). Specifically, in SEEMA, only sensors with highly informative
observations transmit their data in each data collection. The sensors transmit
a common shaping waveform and the fusion center receives a superposition of the
analog transmitted signals. SEEMA has important advantages for detection tasks
in WSNs. First, it is highly energy and bandwidth efficient due to transmission
savings and narrowband transmission over MAC. Second, it can be implemented by
simple dumb sensors (oblivious to observation statistics, and local data
processing is not required) which simplifies the implementation as compared to
existing MAC transmission schemes for detection in WSNs. We establish a finite
sample analysis and an asymptotic analysis of the error probability with
respect to the network size and provide system design conditions to obtain the
exponential decay of the error. Specific performance analysis is developed for

there exist quantum phenomena beyond squeezing and sub-Poisson statistics, such
as anomalous quantum correlations of two non-commuting observables. In
particular, it is shown that for the excitation of the zeroth sideband neither
squeezing nor sub-Poisson statistics do occur, but anomalous correlations can
be verified. Furthermore, it is shown how these anomalous correlation functions
can be derived from measured data.

agrarian polytope admits a marking of its vertices which controls the
Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant of the group, improving a result of the second

selecting which updates or alerts to push to emergency responders. However,
prior research has not investigated in depth how many and how often should
these updates be generated, considering a given bound on the workload for a
user due to the limited budget of attention in this stressful work environment.
This paper presents a novel problem and a model to quantify the relationship
between the performance metrics of ranking systems (e.g., recall, NDCG) and the
bounds on the user workload. We then synthesize an alert-based ranking system
that enforces these bounds to avoid overwhelming end-users. We propose a Pareto
optimal algorithm for ranking selection that adaptively determines the
preference of top-k ranking and user workload over time. We demonstrate the
applicability of this approach for Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) by
performing an evaluation based on real world data from six crisis events. We
analyze the trade-off between recall and workload recommendation across
periodic and realtime settings. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
ranking selection approach can improve the efficiency of monitoring social

and DeWitt-Wheeler quantum gravity (equivalent to Feynman-Weinberg quantum
gravity) are a Theory of Everything, then in the very early universe, the
Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) could not have coupled to right handed
electrons and quarks. Tipler further showed that if this property of CBR has
continued, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect would be observed to be too low
by a factor of two. WMAP and PLANCK observed this. Tipler showed that this CBR
property would also mean the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) would
propagate a factor of ten further than standard theory predicts, since most of
the cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to
a quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if a CBR particle cannot couple
to right-handed quarks. We show that taking this additional propagation
distance into account allows us to identify the sources of 86\% of the UHECR
seen by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. We can also identify the sources of 9
of the 11 UHECR seen by the AGASA observatory, and the source of the 320 EeV
UHECR seen by the Fly's Eye instrument. We propose observations to test the
theory underlying the UHECR identifications, beginning with measuring the
redshifts of five galaxies whose apparent visual magnitude we estimate to be
about 15, and whose positions we give to within one arcsecond. The particle

more robust to dropout noise in LiDAR point clouds. With improved model
structure, training loss, batch normalization and additional input channel,
SqueezeSegV2 achieves significant accuracy improvement when trained on real
data. Training models for point cloud segmentation requires large amounts of
labeled point-cloud data, which is expensive to obtain. To sidestep the cost of
collection and annotation, simulators such as GTA-V can be used to create
unlimited amounts of labeled, synthetic data. However, due to domain shift,
models trained on synthetic data often do not generalize well to the real
world. We address this problem with a domain-adaptation training pipeline
consisting of three major components: 1) learned intensity rendering, 2)
geodesic correlation alignment, and 3) progressive domain calibration. When
trained on real data, our new model exhibits segmentation accuracy improvements
of 6.0-8.6% over the original SqueezeSeg. When training our new model on
synthetic data using the proposed domain adaptation pipeline, we nearly double
test accuracy on real-world data, from 29.0% to 57.4%. Our source code and

$K_{\rm min}$ in units of the mutual Hill radius. Planetary systems showing
instability generally include planet pairs with period ratio $<1.33$. Our final
period ratio distribution of all adjacent planet pairs shows dip-peak
structures near first-order mean motion resonances similar to those observed in
the \kepler\ planetary data. Then we compare the probability density function
(PDF) of the de-biased \kepler\ period ratios with those in our simulations and
find a lack of planet pairs with period ratio $> 2.1$ in the
observations---possibly caused either by inward migration before the
dissipation of the disk or by planet pairs not forming with period ratios $>
2.1$ with the same frequency they do with smaller period ratios. By comparing
the PDF of the period ratio between simulation and observation, we obtain an
upper limit of 0.03 on the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distributed
eccentricities when the gas disk dissipated. Finally, our results suggest that
a viable definition for a `packed' or `compact' planetary system be one that
has at least one planet pair with a period ratio less than 1.33. This criterion
would imply that 4\% of the \kepler\ systems (or 6\% of the systems with more

plane and model the dynamics of running as a two-dimensional body with an
alternating aerial and stance phase. Stance is modeled as a passive, impulsive
collision followed by an active, impulsive push-off that compensates for
collisional losses. Such a runner has infinitely many strategies to maintain
periodic gaits on flat ground. However, these strategies differ in how
perturbations due to terrain unevenness are propagated. Instabilities manifest
as tumbling (orientational instability) or failing to maintain a steady speed
(translational instability). We find that open-loop strategies that avoid
sensory feedback are sufficient to maintain stability on step-like terrains
with piecewise flat surfaces that randomly vary in height. However, these
open-loop runners lose orientational stability on rough terrains whose slope
and height vary randomly. Only by avoiding tangential collisions is
orientational stability recovered. Tangential collisions may be avoided through
leg-retraction to match foot and ground speed at touch down. By analyzing the
propagation of perturbations, we derive a single dimensionless parameter that
governs stability and guides the design and control of both biological and

i.e., changes the packet timings of the flow to follow the packet timings
suggested by the fingerprint, and Bob extracts the fingerprints from the output
flows. We model the network as parallel $M/M/1$ queues where each queue is
shared by a flow from Alice to Bob and other flows independent of the flow from

stipulating, primarily, the replacement of traditional transistors with
alternate ""switches"" that dissipate miniscule amounts of energy when they
switch and provide additional functionality that are beneficial for information
processing. An interesting idea that has emerged recently is the notion of
using two-phase (piezoelectric/magnetostrictive) multiferroic nanomagnets with
bistable (or multi-stable) magnetization states to encode digital information
(bits), and switching the magnetization between these states with small
voltages (that strain the nanomagnets) to carry out digital information
processing. The switching delay is ~1 ns and the energy dissipated in the
switching operation can be few to tens of aJ, which is comparable to, or
smaller than, the energy dissipated in switching a modern-day transistor.
Unlike a transistor, a nanomagnet is ""non-volatile"", so a nanomagnetic
processing unit can store the result of a computation locally without refresh
cycles, thereby allowing it to double as both logic and memory. These dual-role
elements promise new, robust, energy-efficient, high-speed computing and signal
processing architectures (usually non-Boolean and often non-von-Neumann) that
can be more powerful, architecturally superior (fewer circuit elements needed
to implement a given function) and sometimes faster than their traditional
transistor-based counterparts. This topical review covers the important
advances in computing and information processing with nanomagnets with emphasis
on strain-switched multiferroic nanomagnets acting as non-volatile and

various intriguing problems, such as Mott metal-insulator transition and Kondo
effect, there is still no convincing theory so far on the availability and
limitation of this method. The abuse of slave-particle method may lead to wrong
physics. As the simplest slave-particle method, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave spin,
which is widely applied to many strongly correlated problems, is highly
accessible and researchable. In this work, we will uncover the nature of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin method by studying a two-site Hubbard model. After
exploring some properties of this toy model, we make a comparative analysis of
the results obtained by three methods: (i) slave-spin method on mean-field
level, (ii) slave-spin method with gauge constraint and (iii) the exact
solution as a benchmark. We find that, protected by particle-hole symmetry, the
slave-spin mean-field method can recover the static properties of ground state
exactly at half filling. Furthermore, in the parameter space where both $U$ and
$T$ are small enough, slave-spin mean-field method is also reliable in
calculating dynamic and thermal dynamic properties. However, when $U$ or $T$ is
considerably large, the mean-field approximation gives ill-defined behavior,
which results from the unphysical states in enlarged Hilbert space. These
findings lead to our conclusion that the accuracy of slave particle can be
guaranteed if we can exclude all unphysical states by enforcing gauge
constraints.Our work demonstrates the promising prospect of slave-particle
method in studying complex strongly correlated models with specific symmetry or

receiver for the South Pole Telescope (SPT). With the receiver installed, the
SPT has joined the global Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array. The receiver
optics select the 230 or 345 GHz mixers by rotating the tertiary mirror around
the optical axis, directing the chief ray from the secondary mirror to the feed
horn of the selected frequency band. The tertiary is installed on top of the
receiver cryostat, which contains both mixer assemblies. The feed horns are
placed symmetrically across the centerline of the telescope optics and tilted
inward by 5.7 degrees from the vertical plane so that their beams intersect at
the chief ray intersection on the tertiary mirror. We have performed vector
beam measurements of the SPT VLBI receiver in both frequency bands. The
measurements preserved the relative location of the beams, to establish the
relative locations of the phase centers of the two horns. Measurements in two
parallel reference planes above the cryostat were used to suppress reflected
light. To model the beam, we derive a general expression of the electric field
vector on the measurement plane for a tilted beam and infer the feed horn
position parameters for both frequency bands by fitting models to data with a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The inferred parameters such as the
tilt angle of the feed horn are in good agreement with the design. We present
the measurement setup, amplitude and phase pattern of the beam, and the fitting
result here.

targets and an attacker who tries to capture them. A variant of these games
assumes security interdependence between targets, facilitating contagion of an
attack. So far only stochastic spread of an attack has been considered. In this
work, we introduce a version of security games, where the attacker
strategically drives the entire spread of attack and where interconnections
between nodes affect their susceptibility to be captured.
  We find that the strategies effective in the settings without contagion or
with stochastic contagion are no longer feasible when spread of attack is
strategic. While in the former settings it was possible to efficiently find
optimal strategies of the attacker, doing so in the latter setting turns out to
be an NP-complete problem for an arbitrary network. However, for some simpler
network structures, such as cliques, stars, and trees, we show that it is
possible to efficiently find optimal strategies of both players. For arbitrary
networks, we study and compare the efficiency of various heuristic strategies.
As opposed to previous works with no or stochastic contagion, we find that
centrality-based defense is often effective when spread of attack is strategic,

Gaussian vector with standardized entries, whose correlation matrix $R$
satisfies $\max_{i\neq j} R_{ij}\leq \rho_0$ for some constant $\rho_0\in

also sharp, in the sense that it is attained up to a constant, independent of

where we simplify and weaken conditions that have recently been used to
establish near-parametric rates of bootstrap approximation. Lastly, an

model is used to study the impact of a frozen adiabatic index in the estimate
of rotation-induced deformations: we assume a polytropic equation of state for
the matter at equilibrium but, since chemical reactions may be slow, the
perturbations with respect to the unstressed configuration are modelled by
using a different adiabatic index. We quantify the impact of a departure of the
adiabatic index from its equilibrium value on the stressed stellar
configuration and we find that a small perturbation can cause large variations
both in displacements and strains. As a first practical application, we
estimate the strain developed between two large glitches in the Vela pulsar
showing that, starting from an initial unstressed configuration, it is not
possible to reach the breaking threshold of the crust, namely to trigger a
starquake. In this sense, the hypothesis that starquakes could trigger the
unpinning of superfluid vortices is challenged and, for the quake to be a
possible trigger, the solid crust must never fully relax after a glitch, making
the sequence of starquakes in a neutron star an history-dependent process.

$\lambda$ of the diagonal bond strength to that of the other four edges
controls the frustration strength. For $0.974<\lambda<2$, the present system
has a nontrivial macroscopic degeneracy, which is called the macroscopically
degenerated tetramer-dimer (MDTD) states. The MDTD states are identical to the
Hilbert space of the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) quantum dimer model (QDM). By
introducing further neighbor couplings in the MDTD states, we calculate the
second-order effective Hamiltonian, which is exactly the same as the
square-lattice QDM with a finite hopping amplitude $t$ and dimer-dimer
interaction $v$. Furthermore, we calculate $v/|t|$ as a function of the ratio
$\lambda$ in the Heisenberg model and examine which phases of the
square-lattice QDM appear in our obtained states. Our obtained QDM has a region
where $\lambda$ exhibits a finite hopping amplitude ($|t|>0$) and repulsive
interaction between dimers ($v>0$). This suggests the possibility of realizing
the resonating valence bond (RVB) state because the RVB state is obtained at

both cause-effect pairs and two kinds of causal graphs are identifiable under
mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data are conducted to
justify the efficacy of ENCI over major existing methods.

$e^+\nu_e \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu b\bar{b}\gamma$ processes and include all
resonant and non-resonant diagrams, interferences, and off-shell effects of the

scale choices and parton density functions are examined to assess their impact
on the cross section ratio. Depending on the transverse momentum cut on the
hard photon a judicious choice of a dynamical scale allows us to obtain
$1\%-3\%$ percent precision on ${\cal R}$. Moreover, for differential cross
section ratios theoretical uncertainties in the range of $1\%-6\%$ have been
estimated. Until now such high precision predictions have only been reserved

represents a very precise observable to be measured at the LHC for example to

first-principles description is still missing and a renewed interest is rising
recently in understanding the nature of the J-band, in particular regarding the
collective mechanisms involved in its formation. In this work, we investigate
the electronic and optical properties of a J-aggregate molecular crystal made

dependent density functional theory approach, we assess the role of the
molecular packing in the enhancement and red shift of the J-band along with the
effects of confinement in the optical absorption, when moving from bulk to
low-dimensional crystal structures. We simulate the optical absorption of
different configurations (i.e., monomer, dimers, a polymer chain, and a
monolayer sheet) extracted from the bulk crystal. By analyzing the induced
charge density associated with the J-band, we conclude that it is a
longitudinal excitation, delocalized along parallel linear chains and that its
overall red shift results from competing coupling mechanisms, some giving red
shift and others giving blue shift, which derive from both coupling between
transition densities and renormalization of the single-particle energy levels.

setting or, in other terms, the reconstruction of periodic continuous-domain
signals from their noisy measurements. We focus on two reconstruction
paradigms: variational and statistical. In the variational approach, the
reconstructed signal is solution to an optimization problem that establishes a
tradeoff between fidelity to the data and smoothness conditions via a quadratic
regularization associated to a linear operator. In the statistical approach,
the signal is modeled as a stationary random process defined from a Gaussian
white noise and a whitening operator; one then looks for the optimal estimator
in the mean-square sense. We give a generic form of the reconstructed signals
for both approaches, allowing for a rigorous comparison of the two.We fully
characterize the conditions under which the two formulations yield the same
solution, which is a periodic spline in the case of sampling measurements. We
also show that this equivalence between the two approaches remains valid on
simulations for a broad class of problems. This extends the practical range of
applicability of the variational method.

plays a significant role in video SR. It is demonstrated by traditional video
SR methods that simultaneous SR of both images and optical flows can provide
accurate correspondences and better SR results. However, LR optical flows are
used in existing deep learning based methods for correspondence generation. In
this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable video SR framework to
super-resolve both images and optical flows. Specifically, we first propose an
optical flow reconstruction network (OFRnet) to infer HR optical flows in a
coarse-to-fine manner. Then, motion compensation is performed according to the
HR optical flows. Finally, compensated LR inputs are fed to a super-resolution
network (SRnet) to generate the SR results. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that HR optical flows provide more accurate correspondences than their LR
counterparts and improve both accuracy and consistency performance. Comparative
results on the Vid4 and DAVIS-10 datasets show that our framework achieves the

  Indexing",,,,,"cs.MM cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, where multimedia data is continuously generated, stored, and
distributed, multimedia indexing, with its purpose of group- ing similar data,
becomes more important than ever. Understanding the gist (=message) of
multimedia instances is framed in related work as a ranking of concepts from a
knowledge base, i.e., Wikipedia. We cast the task of multimedia indexing as a
gist understanding problem. Our pipeline benefits from external knowledge and
two subsequent learning- to-rank (l2r) settings. The first l2r produces a
ranking of concepts rep- resenting the respective multimedia instance. The
second l2r produces a mapping between the concept representation of an instance
and the targeted class topic(s) for the multimedia indexing task. The
evaluation on an established big size corpus (MIRFlickr25k, with 25,000
images), shows that multimedia indexing benefits from understanding the gist.
Finally, with a MAP of 61.42, it can be shown that the multimedia in- dexing
task benefits from understanding the gist. Thus, the presented end-to-end
setting outperforms DBM and competes with Hashing-based methods.

that a ""linear+exponential"" wavefunction proportional to $(1 + \xi)\exp(-\xi)$
(where $\xi$ is a dimensionless radial variable) is the best fit for attractive
self-interactions along the stable branch of solutions, while for small
particle number $N$ it is also the best fit for repulsive self-interactions.
For attractive self-interactions along the unstable branch, a single
exponential is the best fit for small $N$, while a sech wavefunction fits
better for large $N$. The Gaussian wavefunction ansatz, which is used often in
the literature, is exceedingly poor across most of the parameter space, with
the exception of repulsive interactions for large $N$. We investigate a ""double
exponential"" ansatz with a free constant parameter, which is computationally
efficient and can be optimized to fit the exact solutions in different limits.
We show that the double exponential can be tuned to fit the sech ansatz, which
is computationally slow. We also show how to generalize the addition of free
parameters in order to create more computationally efficient ans\""atze using
the double exponential. Determining the best ansatz, according to several
comparison parameters, will be important for analytic descriptions of dynamical
systems. Finally, we examine the underlying relativistic theory, and critically

Experiments include four factors: (1) tools, (2) objects, (3) actions, and (4)

different complex social or anti-social phenomena. The dynamics of these
interactions often lead to certain spatio-temporal patterns and complex
networks, which can be interesting to a wide range of researchers-- from social
scientists to data scientists. Here, we use the publicly available data for a
range of anti-social and political events like ethnic conflicts, human right
violations and terrorist attacks across the globe. We aggregate these
anti-social events over time and study the temporal evolution of these events.
We present here the results of several time-series analyses like recurrence
intervals, Hurst R/S analysis, etc., that reveal the long memory of these
time-series. Further, we filter the data country-wise and study the time-series
of these anti-social events within the individual countries. We find that the
time-series of these events have interesting statistical regularities and
correlations using multi-dimensional scaling technique, the countries are then
grouped together in terms of the co-movements with respect to temporal growths
of these anti-social events. The data science approaches to studying these
anti-social phenomena may provide a deeper understanding about their formations
and spreading. The results can help in framing public policies and creating
strategies that can check their spread and inhibit these anti-social

and interface of an amorphous SiO$_2$ (a-SiO$_2$) thin film on Si substrate. We
find that each optical mode splits into three sub-modes, i.e., surface mode,
bulk mode and interface mode, which can be measured from different locations.
The pure surface modes can be measured in the vacuum near the surface, and the
pure interface modes are expected to be obtained either at the interface
location or in the Si, while inside the SiO$_2$ the measured signal is a
mixture of bulk, surface, and interface modes. The bulk mode has the largest
vibration energy and surface mode has the lowest. The energy of surface mode is
thickness dependent, showing a blue-shift as z-thickness (parallel to fast
electron beam) of SiO$_2$ film increases, while the bulk and interface modes
have constant vibration energy. The intensity of bulk mode linearly increases
with thickness being increased, and it drops steeply to zero near the surface
and interface (within a few nanometers). The surface modes decay slowly in the
vacuum following a Bessel function. The mechanism of the observed spatially
dependent vibration behavior is discussed and quantitatively compared with
dielectric response theory analysis. Our nanometer scale measurements of
vibrations properties provide useful information about the bonding conditions
at the surface and interface and thus may help to design better silicon-based

investigated for the case of four infinite (or large) and one compact

gravity in more than four dimensions might be able to solve the so-called
hierarchy problem of the Standard Model of elementary particle physics because
the assumed extra dimensions allow to unify the true Planck scale with the
electroweak scale. In a first step the Einstein-Hilbert theory for the
functional renormalisation group treatment of Quantum Gravity is introduced. To
set the scene for the following investigation including a compact dimension
first some corresponding calculations for four and more large dimensions are
performed and the results are found to be in agreement with already known ones.
The equations determining the renormalisation group flows are then derived for
the case of one compact dimension. These dimensionally reduced renormalisation
group equations are then numerically solved for the case of four large and one
compact dimension. Results for the four- to five-dimensional crossover are then
discussed employing two forms of the background field flow in the
Einstein-Hilbert theory for the case of one extra compact dimension.
Renormalisation group trajectories allowing for a significant lowering of the

running gravitational coupling at the four- to five-dimensional crossover and

and moves without any external moving parts. With 2 s exposures we photograph
the trajectory of the mechanism using an LED blocked except for a pin-hole and
fixed to the mechanism. Trajectories can exhibit period doubling phenomena
similar to a ball bouncing on a vibrating table top. A two dimensional
numerical model gives similar trajectories, though a vertical drag force is
required to keep the mechanism height low. We attribute the vertical drag force
to aerodynamic suction from air flow below the mechanism base and through the
granular substrate. Our numerical model suggests that speed is maximized when
the mechanism is prevented from jumping high off the surface. In this way the
mechanism resembles a galloping or jumping animal whose body remains nearly at

network connection and (ii) the proactive and intelligent actuation at edge
devices. A promising approach to address these two requirements is to enable
mobile edge devices to share their communication, computation, and caching (3C)
resources via device-to-device (D2D) connections. In this paper, we propose a
general 3C resource sharing framework, which includes many existing 1C/2C
sharing models in the literature as special cases. Comparing with 1C/2C models,
the proposed 3C framework can further improve the resource utilization
efficiency by offering more flexibilities in the device cooperation and
resource scheduling. As a typical example, we focus on the energy utilization
under the proposed 3C framework. Specifically, we formulate an energy
consumption minimization problem under the 3C framework, which is an integer
non-convex optimization problem. To solve the problem, we first transform it
into an equivalent integer linear programming problem that is much easier to
solve. Then, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on linear programming,
which can further reduce the computation time and produce a result that is
empirically close to the optimal solution. Moreover, we evaluate the energy
reduction due to the 3C sharing both analytically and numerically. Numerical
results show that, comparing with the existing 1C/2C approaches, the proposed
3C sharing framework can reduce the total energy consumption by 83.8% when the
D2D energy is negligible. The energy reduction is still 27.5% when the D2D
transmission energy per unit time is twice as large as the cellular
