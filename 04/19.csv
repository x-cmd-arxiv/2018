connecting it to a thermal bath held at ambient temperature without external
intervention, would be quite unexpected. We describe the equivalent of a
'thermal inductor', composed of a Peltier element and an electric inductance,
which can drive the temperature difference between two bodies to change sign by
imposing inertia on the heat flowing between them, and enable continuing heat
transfer from the chilling body to its warmer counterpart without the need of
an external driving force. We demonstrate its operation in an experiment and
show that the process can pass through a series of quasi-equilibrium states
while fully complying with the second law of thermodynamics. This 'thermal
inductor' extends the analogy between electrical and thermal circuits and could
serve, with further progress in thermoelectric materials, to cool hot materials
well below ambient temperature without external energy supply or moving parts.

barrier. Without a priori knowledge of the energy landscape, multidimensional
search methods aim to find such minimum energy pathways between the initial and
final states of a kinetic process. However in many cases, the user has to
repeatedly provide initial guess paths, thus ensuring that the reliability of
the final result is heavily user-dependent. Recently, the idea of ""distortion
symmetry groups"" as a complete description of the symmetry of a path has been
introduced. Through this, a new framework is enabled that provides a powerful
means of classifying the infinite collection of possible pathways into a finite
number of symmetry equivalent subsets, and then exploring each of these subsets
systematically using rigorous group theoretical methods. The method is shown to
lead to the discovery of new, previously hidden pathways for the case studies
of bulk ferroelectric switching and domain wall motion in proper and improper
ferroelectrics, as well as in multiferroic switching. This approach is
applicable to a wide variety of physical phenomena ranging from structural,
electronic and magnetic distortions, diffusion, and phase transitions in

simulations to provide a complete description of the competition between

crossover between frictionless and frictional jamming regimes which is
controlled by thermal fluctuations and particle softness and occurs at a
softness dependent P\'eclet number. We also explore the consequences of our

surface energy of powder particles in combination with a van-der-Waals force
curve regularization. The model is applied to predict the angle of repose (AOR)
of exemplary spherical Ti-6Al-4V powders, and the surface energy value
underlying the adhesion force law is calibrated by fitting the corresponding
angle of repose values from numerical and experimental funnel tests. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work providing an
experimental estimate for the effective surface energy of the considered class
of metal powders. By this approach, an effective surface energy of $0.1mJ/m^2$
is found for the investigated Ti-6Al-4V powder. This value is considerably
lower than typical experimental values for flat metal contact surfaces in the
range of $30-50 mJ/m^2$, indicating the crucial influence of factors such as
surface roughness and chemical surface contamination on fine metal powders.
More importantly, the present study demonstrates that a neglect of the related
cohesive forces leads to a drastical underestimation of the AOR and,
consequently, to an insufficient representation of the bulk powder behavior.

uniformity, is a critical factor influencing the quality of components produced
by powder bed metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, including selective
laser melting, electron beam melting and binder jetting. The present work
employs a computational model to study the critical influence of powder
cohesiveness on the powder recoating process in AM. The model is based on the
discrete element method (DEM) with particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall
interactions involving frictional contact, rolling resistance and cohesive
forces. Quantitative metrics, namely the spatial mean values and standard
deviations of the packing fraction and surface profile field, are defined in
order to evaluate powder layer quality. Based on these metrics, the
size-dependent behavior of exemplary plasma-atomized Ti-6Al-4V powders during
the recoating process is studied. It is found that decreased particle size /
increased cohesiveness leads to considerably decreased powder layer quality in
terms of low, strongly varying packing fractions and highly non-uniform surface
profiles. For relatively fine-grained powders (mean particle diameter $17 \mu
m$), it is shown that cohesive forces dominate gravity forces by two orders of
magnitude leading to low quality powder layers not suitable for subsequent
laser melting without additional layer / surface finishing steps. Besides
particle-to-particle adhesion, this contribution quantifies the influence of
mechanical bulk powder material parameters, nominal layer thickness, blade
velocity as well as particle-to-wall adhesion. Finally, the implications of the
resulting powder layer characteristics on the subsequent melting process are
discussed and practical recommendations are given for the choice of powder
recoating process parameters.

back three decades, suggesting that for an open set of initially smooth
solutions to the Einstein-vacuum equations in high dimensions, stable,
approximately monotonic curvature singularities can dynamically form along a
spacelike hypersurface. In this article, we study the Cauchy problem and give a
rigorous proof of this phenomenon in sufficiently high dimensions, thereby
providing the first constructive proof of stable curvature blowup (without
symmetry assumptions) along a spacelike hypersurface as an effect of pure
gravity. Our proof applies to an open subset of regular initial data satisfying
the assumptions of Hawking's celebrated ""singularity"" theorem, which shows that
the solution is geodesically incomplete but does not reveal the nature of the
incompleteness. Specifically, our main result is a proof of the dynamic
stability of the Kasner curvature singularity for a subset of Kasner solutions
whose metrics exhibit only moderately (as opposed to severely) spatially
anisotropic behavior. Of independent interest is our method of proof, which is
more robust than earlier approaches in that i) it does not rely on approximate
monotonicity identities and ii) it accommodates the possibility that the
solution develops very singular high-order spatial derivatives, whose blowup
rates are allowed to be, within the scope of our bootstrap argument, much worse
than those of the base-level quantities driving the fundamental blowup. For
these reasons, our approach could be used to obtain similar blowup results for
various Einstein-matter systems in any number of spatial dimensions for
solutions corresponding to an open set of moderately spatially anisotropic
initial data, thus going beyond the nearly spatially isotropic regime treated
in earlier works.

check whether a given pattern will be achieved by the swarm from any initial
configuration. An attractive feature of this proof procedure is that it is
local in nature, avoiding as much as possible the computational explosion that
can be expected with increasing robots, states, and action possibilities. Our
approach is based on extracting the local states that constitute a global goal
(in this case, a pattern). We then formally show that these local states can
only coexist when the global desired pattern is achieved and that, until this
occurs, there is always a sequence of actions that will lead from the current
pattern to the desired pattern. Furthermore, we show that the agents will never
perform actions that could a) lead to intra-swarm collisions or b) cause the
swarm to separate. After an analysis of the performance of pattern formation in
the discrete domain, we also test the system in continuous time and space
simulations and reproduce the results using asynchronous agents operating in

that gives off probabilistic warnings when the sender acts deceptively. Then we
derive pooling and partially-separating equilibria of the game. We find that 1)
high-quality detectors eliminate some pure-strategy equilibria, 2) detectors
with high true-positive rates encourage more honest signaling than detectors
with low false-positive rates, 3) receivers obtain optimal outcomes for
equal-error-rate detectors, and 4) surprisingly, deceptive senders sometimes
benefit from highly accurate deception detectors. We illustrate these results

However, this interpretation is an inheritance of a gradualistic view that has

Actually, when the complex architecture of genotype spaces is taken into
account, the evolutionary dynamics of molecular populations becomes
intrinsically non-uniform, sharing deep qualitative and quantitative
similarities with slowly driven physical systems: non-linear responses
analogous to critical transitions, sudden state changes, or hysteresis, among
others. Furthermore, the phenotypic plasticity inherent to genotypes transforms
classical fitness landscapes into multiscapes where adaptation in response to
an environmental change may be very fast. The quantitative nature of adaptive

interactions that lead to tighter, more circular orbits. When at least one star
in a binary has evolved off of the main sequence, orbital circularization
occurs for longer-period (~100 day) systems. Past work by (Verbunt & Phinney
1995) has shown that the orbital parameters and the circularization periods of
a small sample of binary stars with evolved-star members can be understood
within the context of standard tidal circularization theory. Using a sample of
binaries with subgiant, giant, and red clump star members that is nearly an
order of magnitude larger, we reexamine predictions for tidal circularization
of binary stars with evolved members. We confirm that systems predicted by
equilibrium-tide theory to have circular orbits generally have negligible
measured eccentricities. The circularization period is correlated with the
surface gravity (i.e. size) of the evolved member, indicating that the
circularization timescale must be shorter than the evolutionary timescale along
the giant branch. A few exceptions to the conclusions above are mentioned in
the discussion: Some of these exceptions are likely systems in which the
spectrum of the secondary biases the radial velocity measurements, but four
appear to be genuine, short-period, moderate-eccentricity systems.

exponent $H$, which describes the structural roughness. Given that the
structure of molecular clouds and the initial structure of star clusters are
almost certainly linked, it would be advantageous to also apply this analysis
to clusters. Currently, the structure of star clusters is often quantified by
applying $\mathcal{Q}$ analysis. $\mathcal{Q}$ values from observed targets are
interpreted by comparing them with those from artificial clusters. These are
typically generated using a Box-Fractal (BF) or Radial Density Profile (RDP)
model. We present a single cluster model, based on FBM, as an alternative to
these models. Here, the structure is parameterised by $H$, and the standard
deviation of the log-surface/volume density $\sigma$. The FBM model is able to
reproduce both centrally concentrated and substructured clusters, and is able
to provide a much better match to observations than the BF model. We show that
$\mathcal{Q}$ analysis is unable to estimate FBM parameters. Therefore, we
develop and train a machine learning algorithm which can estimate values of $H$
and $\sigma$, with uncertainties. This provides us with a powerful method for
quantifying the structure of star clusters in terms which relate to the
structure of molecular clouds. We use the algorithm to estimate the $H$ and
$\sigma$ for several young star clusters, some of which have no measurable BF

important to reionization. Relatedly, [OIII]/[OII] has been put forward as an
indirect estimator of the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape fraction ($f_{esc}$) at
$z\gtrsim4.5$ when the opaque IGM renders LyC photons unobservable. Using deep
archival U-band (VLT/VIMOS) imaging of a recently confirmed overdensity at
$z\sim3.5$ we calculate tight constraints on $f_{esc}$ for a sample (N=73)
dominated by extreme [OIII] emitters. We find no Lyman Continuum signal
($f_{esc}^{rel} < 6.3^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \%$ at $1\sigma$) in a deep U-band stack of
our sample (31.98 mag at 1$\sigma$). This constraint is in agreement with
recent studies of star-forming galaxies spanning $z\sim1-4$ that have found
very low average $f_{esc}$. Despite the galaxies in our study having an
estimated average rest-frame EW([OIII]$\lambda5007$)$\sim400\AA$ and
[OIII]/[OII]$\sim 4$ from composite SED-fitting, we find no LyC detection,
which brings into question the potential of [OIII]/[OII] as an effective probe
of the LyC--a majority of LyC emitters have [OIII]/[OII]$>3$, but we establish
here that [OIII]/[OII]$>3$ does not guarantee significant LyC leakage for a
population. Since even extreme star-forming galaxies are unable to produce the
$f_{esc}\sim10-15\%$ required by most theoretical calculations for star-forming
galaxies to drive reionization, there must either be a rapid evolution of
$f_{esc}$ between $z\sim3.5$ and the Epoch of Reionization, or hitherto
observationally unstudied sources (e.g. ultra-faint low-mass galaxies with
$\log(M/M_\odot)\sim7-8.5$) must make an outsized contribution to reionization.

(SM) neutrino mass emerges from the exchange of TeV scale singlets with sizable
Yukawa couplings, which can be tested at colliders. However, the tiny Majorana
mass splitting between TeV singlets, introduced to accommodate small neutrino
masses, is left unexplained. Moreover, we argue that these models suffer from a
structural limitation that prevents a successful leptogenesis if one insists on
having unsuppressed Yukawa couplings and TeV scale singlets. In this work we
propose a hybrid seesaw model, where we replace the mass splitting with a
coupling to a high scale seesaw module including a TeV scalar. We show that
this structure achieves the goal of filling both the above gaps with couplings
of order unity. The necessary structure automatically arises embedding the
seesaw mechanism in composite Higgs models, but may also be enforced by new
gauge symmetries in a weakly-coupled theory. Our hybrid seesaw models have
distinguishing features compared to the standard high scale type-I seesaw and
inverse seesaw. Firstly, they have much richer phenomenology. Indeed, they
generally predict new TeV scale physics (including scalars) potentially
accessible at present and future colliders, whereas weakly-coupled versions may
also have astrophysical and cosmological signatures due to the presence of a
light Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to neutrinos. Secondly, our scenario
features an interesting interplay between high scale and TeV scale physics in
leptogenesis and enlarges the range of allowed high scale singlet masses beyond
the usual $\sim 10^9-10^{ 15 }$ GeV, without large hierarchies in the Yukawa
couplings nor small mass splitting among the singlets.

balance assumptions in global SED fitting. Through a stacking analysis of the
resolved radial profiles of the CO(3-2), stellar and dust continuum emission in
SMG samples, we find that the cool molecular gas emission in these sources

long-lived, coherent dynamical features in the halo of the Milky Way. Due to
their different ages and different positions in phase space, different streams
tell us different things about the Galaxy. Here we employ a Cramer--Rao (CRLB)
or Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in
eleven known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D,
PS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum). This approach depends on a generative model,
which we have developed previously, and which permits calculation of
derivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream
parameters. We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on
eccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each
stream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo properties and
parameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous
fitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level.
At this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic
parametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions to give the
gravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information
about the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current
position of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream
appears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this
motivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB formalism
also permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar
velocities, distances, and proper motions. We show that kinematic measurements
of stream stars are essential for producing competitive constraints on the
distribution of dark matter, which bodes well for stream studies in the age of
Gaia.

predict that during the early stages of assembly of the cluster at $z \gtrsim
3$, where the star formation activity is at its maximum in our simulations, the
proto-cluster regions are rich of dusty gas. Compared to the case in which only
dust production in stellar ejecta is active, if we include processes occurring
in the cold ISM,the dust content is enhanced by a factor $2-3$. However, the
dust properties in this stage turn out to be significantly different than those
observationally derived for the {\it average} Milky Way dust, and commonly
adopted in calculations of dust reprocessing. We show that these differences
may have a strong impact on the predicted spectral energy distributions. At low
redshift in star forming regions our model reproduces reasonably well the trend
of dust abundances over metallicity as observed in local galaxies. However we
under-produce by a factor of 2 to 3 the total dust content of clusters

estimating Galactic birth radii, r_birth, for Milky Way disk stars. The
technique relies on the justifiable assumption that a negative radial
metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium (ISM) existed for most of the
disk lifetime. Stars are projected back to their birth positions according to
the observationally derived age and [Fe/H] with no kinematical information
required. Applying our approach to the AMBRE:HARPS and HARPS-GTO local samples,
we show that we can constrain the ISM metallicity evolution with Galactic
radius and cosmic time, [Fe/H]_ISM(r, t), by requiring a physically meaningful
r_birth distribution. We find that the data are consistent with an ISM radial
metallicity gradient that flattens with time from ~-0.15 dex/kpc at the
beginning of disk formation, to its measured present-day value (-0.07 dex/kpc).
We present several chemo-kinematical relations in terms of mono-r_birth
populations. One remarkable result is that the kinematically hottest stars
would have been born locally or in the outer disk, consistent with thick disk
formation from the nested flares of mono-age populations and predictions from
cosmological simulations. This phenomenon can be also seen in the observed
age-velocity dispersion relation, in that its upper boundary is dominated by
stars born at larger radii. We also find that the flatness of the local
age-metallicity relation (AMR) is the result of the superposition of the AMRs
of mono-r_birth populations, each with a well-defined negative slope. The solar
birth radius is estimated to be 7.3+-0.6 kpc, for a current Galactocentric
radius of 8 kpc.

Cheeger-type inequalities for nonpositive matrices (aka stoquastic
Hamiltonians), real matrices, and Hermitian matrices. For matrices written $H =
L+W$, where $L$ is either a combinatorial or normalized graph Laplacian, I show
that: (1) when $W$ is diagonal and $L$ has maximum degree $d_{\max}$, $2h \geq
\gamma \geq \sqrt{h^2 + d_{\max}^2}-d_\max$; (2) when $W$ is real, we can often
route negative-weighted edges along positive-weighted edges such that the
Cheeger constant of the resulting graph obeys an inequality similar to that
above; and (3) when $W$ is Hermitian, the weighted Cheeger constant obeys $2h
\geq \gamma$ here $h$ is the weighted Cheeger constant of $H$. This constant
reduces bounds on $\gamma$ to information contained in the underlying graph and
the Hamiltonian's ground-state.
  If efficiently computable, the constant opens up a very clear path towards
adaptive quantum adiabatic algorithms, those that adjust the adiabatic path
based on spectral structure. I sketch a bashful adiabatic algorithm that aborts
the adiabatic process early, uses the resulting state to approximate the
weighted Cheeger constant, and restarts the process using the updated
information. Should this approach work, it would provide more rigorous
foundations for adiabatic quantum computing without \textit{a priori} knowledge

thermal radiation of intergalactic dust instead of a relic radiation of the Big
Bang, is revived and revisited. The model suggests that a virtually transparent
local Universe becomes considerably opaque at redshifts $z > 2-3$. Such opacity
is hardly to be detected in the Type Ia supernova data, but confirmed using
quasar data. The opacity steeply increases with redshift because of a high
proper density of intergalactic dust in the previous epochs. The temperature of
intergalactic dust increases as $(1+z)$ and exactly compensates the change of
wavelengths due to redshift, so that the dust radiation looks apparently like
the radiation of the blackbody with a single temperature. The predicted dust
temperature is $T^{D} = 2.776 \, \mathrm{K}$, which differs from the CMB
temperature by 1.9\% only, and the predicted ratio between the total CMB and
EBL intensities is 13.4 which is close to 12.5 obtained from observations. The
CMB temperature fluctuations are caused by EBL fluctuations produced by galaxy
clusters and voids in the Universe. The polarization anomalies of the CMB
correlated with temperature anisotropies are caused by the polarized thermal
emission of needle-shaped conducting dust grains aligned by large-scale
magnetic fields around clusters and voids. A strong decline of the luminosity
density for $z > 4$ is interpreted as the result of high opacity of the
Universe rather than of a decline of the global stellar mass density at high
redshifts.

released through the interaction of the supernova shockwaves with their dense
circumstellar medium (CSM). The ultraluminous Type IIn supernova SN 2010jl
exhibits an infrared emission component that is in excess of the extrapolated
UV-optical spectrum as early as a few weeks post-explosion. This emission has
been attributed by some as evidence for rapid formation of dust in the cooling
postshock CSM. We investigate the physical processes that may inhibit or
facilitate the formation of dust in the CSM. When only radiative cooling is
considered, the temperature of the dense shocked gas rapidly drops below the
dust condensation temperature. However, by accounting for the heating of the
postshock gas by the downstream radiation from the shock, we show that dust
formation is inhibited until the radiation from the shock weakens, as the shock
propagates into the less dense outer regions of the CSM. In SN 2010jl dust
formation can therefore only commence after day 380. Only the IR emission since
that epoch can be attributed to the newly formed CSM dust. Observations on day
460 and later show that the IR luminosity exceeds the UV-optical luminosity.
The post-shock dust cannot extinct the radiation emitted by the expanding SN
shock. Therefore, its IR emission must be powered by an interior source, which
we identify with the reverse shock propagating through the SN ejecta. IR
emission before day 380 must therefore be an IR echo from preexisting CSM dust.

in Galactic classical novae are twice as large as those of field white dwarfs.
Only a handful of dynamically well-determined nova white dwarf masses have been
published, leaving the theoretical predictions poorly tested. The recurrence
time distributions and mass accretion rate distributions of novae are even more
poorly known. To address these deficiencies, we have combined our extensive
simulations of nova eruptions with the Strope et al (2010) and Schaefer et al
(2010) databases of outburst characteristics of Galactic classical and
recurrent novae to determine the masses of 92 white dwarfs in novae. We find
that the mean mass (frequency averaged mean mass) of 82 Galactic classical
novae is 1.06 (1.13) Msun, while the mean mass of 10 recurrent novae is 1.31
Msun. These masses, and the observed nova outburst amplitude and decline time
distributions allow us to determine the long-term mass accretion rate
distribution of classical novae. Remarkably, that value is just 1.3 x 10^{-10}
Msun/yr, which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of cataclysmic
binaries in the decades before and after classical nova eruptions. This
predicts that old novae become low mass transfer rate systems, and hence dwarf
novae, for most of the time between nova eruptions. We determine the mass
accretion rates of each of the 10 known Galactic RN, finding them to be in the
range 10^{-7} - 10^{-8} $ Msun/yr. We are able to predict the recurrence time
distribution of novae and compare it with the predictions of population

primary cancers at different sites during his/her lifetime. Patients with

germline TP53 mutations, are known to have a higher probability of developing a
second primary cancer than those with other cancer syndromes. In this context,
it is desirable to model the development of multiple primary cancers to enable
better clinical management of LFS. Here, we propose a Bayesian recurrent event
model based on a non-homogeneous Poisson process in order to obtain penetrance
estimates for multiple primary cancers related to LFS. We employed a
family-wise likelihood that facilitates using genetic information inherited
through the family pedigree and properly adjusted for the ascertainment bias
that was inevitable in studies of rare diseases by using an inverse probability
weighting scheme. We applied the proposed method to data on LFS, using a family
cohort collected through pediatric sarcoma patients at MD Anderson Cancer
Center from 1944 to 1982. Both internal and external validation studies showed
that the proposed model provides reliable penetrance estimates for multiple
primary cancers in LFS, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been
reported in the LFS literature.

function of distance from the nucleus and compare them to models for different
excitation mechanisms: shocks, photoionization by the accreting black hole, and
photoionization by young or old hot stars. We also consider the kinematics of
the line-emitting gas, as revealed by the widths and shifts of the emission
lines. We conclude that, in LINERs with low-luminosity active nuclei, shocks by
jets or other outflows are crucial in exciting the gas in and around the

different test performance, even when all of them achieve optimal rewards

evaluation protocols in RL. We conclude with a general discussion on

additionally admitting a form of counting. In fact, almost all ontologies in

to do so. We then establish a variation of Ladner's Theorem on the existence of
NP-intermediate problems and use this result to show that for other fragments,
there is provably no such dichotomy. Again for other fragments (such as full

complexity of constraint satisfaction problems. We also link these results to
Datalog-rewritability and study the decidability of whether a given ontology

multistep schemes that involve a free parameter, strategies are presented on
how to choose the ImEx splitting and the time stepping parameter, so that

These strategies are based on recently developed stability concepts, which also
provide novel insights into the limitations of existing semi-implicit backward

order time stepping that is not otherwise possible with SBDF. With specific
applications in nonlinear diffusion problems and incompressible channel flows,
it is demonstrated how the unconditional stability property can be leveraged to
efficiently solve stiff nonlinear or nonlocal problems without the need to

  In this paper, we study this effect in Josephson junctions composed of two
semiconducting nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and induced
superconductivity from the proximity effect. For certain orientations of the
external magnetic field, such junctions possess a chiral symmetry and we show
how this symmetry allows the Andreev spectrum and the protected crossings to be

then displays a geometrically induced anomalous Josephson effect, the flow of a
supercurrent in the absence of external phase bias. Furthermore, we derive a
proportionality relation between the local current density and the local
curvature for a single curved wire. This result can be viewed as a
one-dimensional analogue of the recently proposed geo-Josephson effect

key quantity for describing the thermodynamic stability of solid-state
compounds. To answer this question, we perform an extensive benchmark of SCAN
by computing the formation energies for a diverse group of nearly one thousand
crystalline compounds for which experimental values are known. Due to an
enhanced exchange interaction in the covalent bonding regime, SCAN
substantially decreases the formation energy errors for strongly-bound
compounds, by approximately 50% to 110 meV/atom, as compared to the generalized
gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). However, for
intermetallic compounds, SCAN performs moderately worse than PBE with an
increase in formation energy error of approximately 20%, stemming from SCAN's
distinct behavior in the weak bonding regime. The formation energy errors can
be further reduced via elemental chemical potential fitting. We find that SCAN
leads to significantly more accurate predicted crystal volumes, moderately
enhanced magnetism, and mildly improved band gaps as compared to PBE. Overall,
SCAN represents a significant improvement in accurately describing the
thermodynamics of strongly-bound compounds.

of the faithfulness of simulations of $N$-body systems. The errors are
quantified through the numerical reversibility of small-$N$ spherical systems,
and by comparing fixed-timestep runs with different stepsizes. The errors add
randomly, before exponential divergence sets in, with exponentiation rate
virtually independent of $N$, but scale saturating as $\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$, in
line with theoretical estimates presented. In a third phase, the growth rate is
initially driven by multiplicative enhancement of errors, as in the exponential
stage. It is then qualitatively different for the phase space variables and
mean field conserved quantities (energy and momentum); for the former, the
errors grow systematically through phase mixing, for the latter they grow
diffusively. For energy, the $N$-variation of the `relaxation time' of error
growth follows the $N$-scaling of two-body relaxation. This is also true for
angular momentum in the fixed stepsize runs, although the associated error
threshold is higher and the relaxation time smaller. Due to shrinking
saturation scales, the information loss associated with the exponential
instability decreases with $N$ and the dynamical entropy vanishes at any finite
resolution as $N \rightarrow \infty$. A distribution function depending on the
integrals of motion in the smooth potential is decreasingly affected. In this
sense there is convergence to the collisionless limit, despite the persistence
of exponential instability on infinitesimal scales. Nevertheless, the slow
$N$-variation in its saturation points to the slowness of the convergence.

a lossy ancillary mode shortens the lifetime of the target photonic mode and
suppresses its density of states, preventing the photon emissions into the

drop impacting on and moving through a confining orifice, wherein the effects
of edge geometry (round- vs. sharp-edged) and surface wettability (hydrophobic

and time-resolved PIV, we quantify the redistribution of energy in the drop and
the surrounding fluid during the drop's impact and motion through a round-edged
orifice. The measurements show the importance of a) drop kinetic energy
transferred to and dissipated within the surrounding liquid, and b) the drop
kinetic energy due to internal deformation and rotation during impact and
passage through the orifice. While a rounded orifice edge prevents contact
between the drop and orifice surface, a sharp edge promotes contact immediately
upon impact, changing the near surface flow field as well as the drop passage
dynamics. For a sharp-edged hydrophobic orifice, the contact lines remain
localized near the orifice edge, but slipping and pinning strongly affect the
drop propagation and outcome. For a sharp-edged hydrophilic orifice, on the
other hand, the contact lines propagate away from the orifice edge, and their
motion is coupled with the global velocity fields in the drop and the
surrounding fluid. By examining the contact line propagation over a hydrophilic
orifice surface with minimal drop penetration, we characterize two stages of
drop spreading that exhibit power-law dependence with variable exponent. In the
first stage, the contact line propagates under the influence of impact inertia
and gravity. In the second stage, inertial influence subsides, and the contact
line propagates mainly due to wettability.

astronomers from a geometric point of view. Their estimation of ~1800"",
although incorrect, was not truly called into question for several centuries.
The first pioneer works for measuring the Sun's diameter with an astrometric
precision were made around the year 1660 by Gabriel Mouton, then by Picard and
La Hire. A canonical value of the solar radius of 959"".63 was adopted by Auwers
in 1891. Despite considerable efforts during the second half of the XXth
century, involving dedicated space instruments, no consensus was reached on
this issue. However, with the advent of high sensitivity instruments on board
satellites, such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
aboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), it was possible to extract with
an unprecedented accuracy the surface gravity oscillation f modes, over nearly
two solar cycles, from 1996 to 2017. Their analysis in the range of angular
degree l=140-300 shows that the so-called ""seismic radius"" exhibits a temporal
variability in anti-phase with the solar activity. Even if the link between the
two radii (photospheric and seismic) can be made only through modeling, such
measurements provide an interesting alternative which led to a revision of the
standard solar radius by the International Astronomical Union in 2015. This new
look on such modern measurements of the Sun's global changes from 1996 to 2017
gives a new way for peering into the solar interior, mainly to better

  Structures",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the introduction of retroactive data structures at SODA 2004, a major
unsolved problem has been to bound the gap between the best partially
retroactive data structure (where changes can be made to the past, but only the
present can be queried) and the best fully retroactive data structure (where
the past can also be queried) for any problem. It was proved in 2004 that any
partially retroactive data structure with operation time $T(n,m)$ can be
transformed into a fully retroactive data structure with operation time
$O(\sqrt{m} \cdot T(n,m))$, where $n$ is the size of the data structure and $m$
is the number of operations in the timeline [Demaine 2004], but it has been
open for 14 years whether such a gap is necessary.
  In this paper, we prove nearly matching upper and lower bounds on this gap
for all $n$ and $m$. We improve the upper bound for $n \ll \sqrt m$ by showing
a new transformation with multiplicative overhead $n \log m$. We then prove a
lower bound of $\min\{n \log m, \sqrt m\}^{1-o(1)}$ assuming any of the
following conjectures:
  - Conjecture I: Circuit SAT requires $2^{n - o(n)}$ time on $n$-input
circuits of size $2^{o(n)}$. (Far weaker than the well-believed SETH
conjecture, which asserts that CNF SAT with $n$ variables and $O(n)$ clauses
already requires $2^{n-o(n)}$ time.)
  - Conjecture II: Online $(\min,+)$ product between an integer $n\times n$
matrix and $n$ vectors requires $n^{3 - o(1)}$ time.
  - Conjecture III (3-SUM Conjecture): Given three sets $A,B,C$ of integers,
each of size $n$, deciding whether there exist $a \in A, b \in B, c \in C$ such
that $a + b + c = 0$ requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time.
  Our lower bound construction illustrates an interesting power of fully
retroactive queries: they can be used to quickly solve batched pair evaluation.
We believe this technique can prove useful for other data structure lower
bounds, especially dynamic ones.

different subcases, in the current paper we consider only $D=3, 4$ cases. For

observational phenomena. In these stars, heavy elements produced by H-He
burning in the rapid proton capture (rp-) process continually freeze to form
new crust. In this paper, we explore the expected composition of the solid
phase. We first demonstrate using molecular dynamics that two distinct types of
chemical separation occur, depending on the composition of the rp-process
ashes. We then calculate phase diagrams for three-component mixtures and use
them to determine the allowed crust compositions. We show that, for the large
range of atomic numbers produced in the rp-process ($Z\sim 10$--$50$), the
solid that forms has only a small number of available compositions. We conclude
that accreting neutron star crusts should be polycrystalline, with domains of

estimate the competence of classifiers using a given criterion over the region

that correctly classify all samples in the region of competence of the test
sample, if such classifier exists, otherwise, it removes from the region of
competence the sample that is furthest from the test sample, and the process

KNORA-E can reduce the region of competence in such a way that only samples of
a single class remain in the region of competence, leading to the selection of
locally incompetent classifiers that classify all samples in the region of
competence as being from the same class. In this paper, we propose two DES
techniques: K-Nearest Oracles Borderline (KNORA-B) and K-Nearest Oracles
Borderline Imbalanced (KNORA-BI). KNORA-B is a DES technique based on KNORA-E
that reduces the region of competence but maintains at least one sample from
each class that is in the original region of competence. KNORA-BI is a
variation of KNORA-B for imbalance datasets that reduces the region of
competence but maintains at least one minority class sample if there is any in
the original region of competence. Experiments are conducted comparing the
proposed techniques with 19 DES techniques from the literature using 40

simultaneous message passing model of communication to help the referee infer a
property of the unknown $\bf p$. What is the least number of players for
inference required in the communication-starved setting of $\ell<\log k$? We
begin by exploring a general ""simulate-and-infer"" strategy for such inference
problems where the center simulates the desired number of samples from the
unknown distribution and applies standard inference algorithms for the
collocated setting. Our first result shows that for $\ell<\log k$ perfect
simulation of even a single sample is not possible. Nonetheless, we present a
Las Vegas algorithm that simulates a single sample from the unknown
distribution using $O(k/2^\ell)$ samples in expectation. As an immediate
corollary, we get that simulate-and-infer attains the optimal sample complexity
of $\Theta(k^2/2^\ell\epsilon^2)$ for learning the unknown distribution to
total variation distance $\epsilon$. For the prototypical testing problem of
identity testing, simulate-and-infer works with $O(k^{3/2}/2^\ell\epsilon^2)$
samples, a requirement that seems to be inherent for all communication
protocols not using any additional resources. Interestingly, we can break this
barrier using public coins. Specifically, we exhibit a public-coin
communication protocol that performs identity testing using
$O(k/\sqrt{2^\ell}\epsilon^2)$ samples. Furthermore, we show that this is
optimal up to constant factors. Our theoretically sample-optimal protocol is
easy to implement in practice. Our proof of lower bound entails showing a
contraction in $\chi^2$ distance of product distributions due to communication
constraints and may be of independent interest.

automatically localize integral objects of semantic interest with weak

obtained by directly selecting the class-specific feature maps of the last
convolutional layer, which paves a simple way to identify object regions. We
then present a simple network architecture including two parallel-classifiers
for object localization. Specifically, we leverage one classification branch to
dynamically localize some discriminative object regions during the forward
pass. Although it is usually responsive to sparse parts of the target objects,
this classifier can drive the counterpart classifier to discover new and
complementary object regions by erasing its discovered regions from the feature
maps. With such an adversarial learning, the two parallel-classifiers are
forced to leverage complementary object regions for classification and can
finally generate integral object localization together. The merits of ACoL are
mainly two-fold: 1) it can be trained in an end-to-end manner; 2) dynamically
erasing enables the counterpart classifier to discover complementary object
regions more effectively. We demonstrate the superiority of our ACoL approach
in a variety of experiments. In particular, the Top-1 localization error rate
on the ILSVRC dataset is 45.14%, which is the new state-of-the-art.

  Scheme",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We apply a recently developed quasi-diabatic (QD) scheme to the symmetric
quasi-classical (SQC) approach for accurate quantum dynamics propagation. By
using the adiabatic states as the quasi-diabatic states during a short-time
quantum dynamics propagation, the QD scheme allows directly interfacing
diabatic SQC method with commonly used adiabatic electronic structure
calculations, thus alleviate tedious theoretical efforts to reformulate SQC in
the adiabatic representation. Further, the QD scheme ensures a stable
propagation of the dynamics and allows using a much larger time step compared
to directly propagating SQC dynamics in the adiabatic representation. This is
due to the fact that the QD scheme does not explicitly require non-adiabatic
couplings that could exhibit highly peaked values during non-adiabatic dynamics
propagation. We perform the QD-SQC calculations with a wide range of model
non-adiabatic systems to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme. This
study opens up the possibility for combining accurate diabatic quantum dynamics
methods such as SQC with any adiabatic electronic structure calculations for
non-adiabatic on-the-fly propagations.

input catalogues of upcoming all-sky surveys, including TESS and FunnelWeb. The
criteria are based on Gaia, WISE and 2MASS all-sky photometry, and deliberately
do not rely on astrometric information. In the lead-up to the availability of
truly distance-limited samples following the release of Gaia DR2, this approach
has the significant benefit of delivering a sample unbiased with regard to
space velocity. Our criteria were developed by using Galaxia synthetic galaxy
model predictions to evaluate both M-dwarf completeness and false-positive
detections (i.e. non-M-dwarf contamination rates). In addition to the
previously known sensitivity of J-H colour for giant-dwarf discrimination at
cool temperatures, we find the WISE W1-W2 colour is also effective at
discriminating M-dwarfs from cool giants. We have derived two sets of Gaia G >
14.5 criteria - a ""high-completeness"" set that contains 78,340 stars, of which
30.7-44.4% are expected to be M-dwarfs and contains 99.3% of the total number
of expected M-dwarfs; and a ""low-contamination"" set that prioritises the stars
most likely to be M-dwarfs at a cost of a reduction in completeness. This
subset contains 40,505 stars and is expected to be comprised of 58.7-64.1%
M-dwarfs, with a completeness of 98%. Comparison of the high-completeness set
with the TESS Input Catalogue has identified 234 stars not currently in that
catalogue, which preliminary analysis suggests could be useful M-dwarf targets
for TESS. We also compared the criteria to selection via absolute magnitude and
a combination of both methods. We found that colour selection in combination
with an absolute magnitude limit provides the most effective way of selecting
M-dwarfs en masse.

Gravitational waves deflect light rays of extragalactic objects, creating
apparent proper motions in a quadrupolar (and higher-order modes) pattern.
Astrometry of extragalactic radio sources is sensitive to gravitational waves
with frequencies between roughly $10^{-18}$ and $10^{-8}$ Hz ($H_0$ and 1/3

is a disadvantage in experiments with high qubit rest error rates. We extend
the technique to extract multiple syndromes at once, without needing more
qubits. Qubits for different syndromes can flag errors in each other. This
gives equally fast and more qubit-efficient alternatives to Steane's
error-correction method, and also conforms to planar geometry constraints.
  We further show that Steane's code and some others can be error-corrected

of upward SWs in a streamer-like structure after the passing of an EUV wave.
The event occurred on 2017 June 1. The EUV wave happened during a typical solar
eruption including a filament eruption, a CME, a C6.6 flare. The EUV wave was
associated with quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) wave trains and a type II
radio burst that represented the existence of a coronal shock. The EUV wave had
a fast initial velocity of $\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$, comparable to high speeds of
the shock and the QFP wave trains. Intriguingly, upward SWs rose slowly
($\sim$80 km s$^{-1}$) in the streamer-like structure after the sweeping of the
EUV wave. The upward SWs seemed to originate from limb brightenings that were
caused by the EUV wave. All the results show the EUV wave is a fast-mode
magnetohydrodynamic shock wave, likely triggered by the flare impulses. We
suggest that part of the EUV wave was probably trapped in the closed magnetic
fields of streamer-like structure, and upward SWs possibly resulted from the
release of trapped waves in the form of slow-mode. It is believed that an
interplay of the strong compression of the coronal shock and the configuration
of the streamer-like structure is crucial for the formation of upward SWs.

circumvent such limitations, we initiate developing a backward theory of
invariant/integral manifolds that complements extant forward theory. Here, for
deterministic non-autonomous ODE systems, we construct a conjugacy with a
normal form system to establish the existence, emergence and exact construction
of center manifolds in a finite domain for systems `arbitrarily close' to that
specified. A benefit is that the constructed invariant manifolds are known to
be exact for systems `close' to the one specified, and hence the only error is
in determining how close over the domain of interest for any specific

equilibrium (LTE). The average ratio (0.31) of the measured
H35$\beta$/H28$\alpha$ fluxes is close to the LTE value of 0.28. No indication
of RRL maser emission has been found. The Lyman photon flux, bolometric, and
submm-RRL luminosities toward the submm-RRL detected sources present
significant correlations. The trends of dust temperature and the ratio of
bolometric luminosity to clump mass, $L_{\rm bol}/M_{\rm clump}$, indicate that
the HII regions are related to the most massive and luminous clumps. By
estimating the production rate of ionizing photons, $Q$, from the submm-RRL
flux, we find that the $Q$(H28$\alpha$) measurements provide estimates of the
Lyman continuum photon flux consistent with those determined from 5 GHz radio
continuum emission.

that depression also has an effect on language usage and that many depressed

of depression using machine learning models based on messages on a social
platform. In particular, a convolutional neural network based on different word
embeddings is evaluated and compared to a classification based on user-level
linguistic metadata. An ensemble of both approaches is shown to achieve
state-of-the-art results in a current early detection task. Furthermore, the
currently popular ERDE score as metric for early detection systems is examined
in detail and its drawbacks in the context of shared tasks are illustrated. A
slightly modified metric is proposed and compared to the original score.
Finally, a new word embedding was trained on a large corpus of the same domain

experimental works have been devoted to studying the thickness dependence of
the different layers in multilayers consisting of heavy metal (HM), ferromagnet
(FM) and capping layers. Here we present a theoretical model based on the
spin-drift-diffusion (SDD) formalism to investigate the effect of the capping
layer properties such as its thickness on the SOT observed in experiments. It
is found that the spin Hall-induced SOT can be significantly enhanced by
incorporating a capping layer with opposite spin Hall angle to that of the HM
layer. The spin Hall torque can be maximized by tuning the capping layer
thickness. However, in the absence of the spin Hall effect (SHE) in the capping
layer, the torque decreases monotonically with capping layer thickness.
Conversely, the spin Hall torque is found to decrease monotonically with the FM
layer thickness, irrespective of the presence or absence of SHE in the capping
layer. All these trends are in correspondence with experimental observations.
Finally, our model suggests that capping layers with long spin diffusion length
and high resistivity would also enhance the spin Hall torque.

can track an arbitrary target in total darkness since it cannot be influenced
by illumination variations. However, there are many unwanted attributes that
constrain the potentials of TIR tracking, such as the absence of visual color
patterns and low resolutions. Recently, structured output support vector
machine (SOSVM) and discriminative correlation filter (DCF) have been
successfully applied to visible object tracking, respectively. Motivated by
these, in this paper, we propose a large margin structured convolution operator
(LMSCO) to achieve efficient TIR object tracking. To improve the tracking
performance, we employ the spatial regularization and implicit interpolation to
obtain continuous deep feature maps, including deep appearance features and
deep motion features, of the TIR targets. Finally, a collaborative optimization
strategy is exploited to significantly update the operators. Our approach not
only inherits the advantage of the strong discriminative capability of SOSVM
but also achieves accurate and robust tracking with higher-dimensional features
and more dense samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
incorporate the advantages of DCF and SOSVM for TIR object tracking.
Comprehensive evaluations on two thermal infrared tracking benchmarks, i.e.
VOT-TIR2015 and VOT-TIR2016, clearly demonstrate that our LMSCO tracker
achieves impressive results and outperforms most state-of-the-art trackers in
terms of accuracy and robustness with sufficient frame rate.

advertisement text. For a review sentence, the outcome could be the review

major challenge in performing QuaSE is how to perceive the outcome-related
wordings, and only edit them to change the outcome. In this paper, the proposed
framework contains two latent factors, namely, outcome factor and content
factor, disentangled from the input sentence to allow convenient editing to
change the outcome and keep the content. Our framework explores the
pseudo-parallel sentences by modeling their content similarity and outcome
differences to enable a better disentanglement of the latent factors, which
allows generating an output to better satisfy the desired outcome and keep the

generating expected output by exploiting the couplings of latent factors of

first encodes both video and sentence via Bidirectional LSTM networks. Then, a

Finally, a novel attention based location regression network is designed to

one of the major challenges of multimedia retrieval. While many video copy

propose a new efficient content-based video copy detection algorithm improving
both aspects. The idea of our approach consists in utilizing self-similarity

We benchmark our algorithm on the MuscleVCD ST1 benchmark dataset and show that

more complex in terms of functional components as well as interconnected
hardware and software components. Thus, holistic systems engineering becomes a
severe challenge. Emergent properties like system safety are not solely
arguable in singular viewpoints such as structural representations of software
or electrical wiring (e.g. fault tolerant). This states the need to get several
viewpoints on a system and describe correspondences between these views in
order to enable traceability of emergent system properties. Today, the most
abstract view found in architecture frameworks is a logical description of
system functions which structures the system in terms of information flow and
functional components. In this article we extend established system viewpoints
towards a capability-based assessment of an automated vehicle and conduct an
exemplary safety analysis to derive behavioral safety requirements. These
requirements can afterwards be attributed to different viewpoints in an
architecture frameworks and thus be integrated into a development process for
automated vehicles.

the voltage between the isothermal ends of the U, while applying a temperature

a uniform applied temperature gradient, the Pt acts as a differential

the CCF indicators and apply a kernel regression (KR) between the RV, the time,
and each of the indicators to study their capability of reproducing the RV
variations induced by stellar activity. The considered indicators together with
the KR prove to be useful to detect activity-induced RV variations in $47 \pm
18$ percent of the stars over a two-year time span when a significance
(two-sided p-value) threshold of one percent is adopted. In those cases, KR
reduces the standard deviation of the RV time series by a factor of
approximately two. The BIS, the FWHM, and the newly introduced $V_{\rm
asy(mod)}$ are the best indicators, being useful in $27 \pm 13$, $13 \pm 9$,
and $13 \pm 9$ percent of the cases, respectively. The relatively limited
performances of the activity indicators are related to the very low activity
level and $v\sin i$ of the considered stars. For the application of our
approach to sun-like stars, a spectral resolution of at least $10^5$ and highly
stabilized spectrographs are recommended.

diffusive, advective and reactive terms, motivated by the study of
three-dimensional heterogeneous physical systems composed of two or more media
separated by a selective interface. We propose a novel approach for the
numerical approximation of such heterogeneous systems combining, for the first
time: (1) a dual mixed hybrid (DMH) finite element method (FEM) based on the
lowest order Raviart-Thomas space (RT0); (2) a Three-Field (3F) formulation;
and (3) a Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization method. Using
the abstract theory for generalized saddle-point problems and their
approximation, we show that the weak formulation of the proposed method and its
numerical counterpart are both uniquely solvable and that the resulting finite
element scheme enjoys optimal convergence properties with respect to the
discretization parameter. In addition, an efficient implementation of the
proposed formulation is presented. The implementation is based on a systematic
use of static condensation which reduces the method to a nonconforming finite
element approach on a grid made by three-dimensional simplices. Extensive
computational tests demonstrate the theoretical conclusions and indicate that
the proposed DMH-RT0 FEM scheme is accurate and stable even in the presence of
marked interface jump discontinuities in the solution and its associated normal
flux. Results also show that in the case of strongly dominating advective
terms, the proposed method with the SUPG stabilization is capable of resolving
accurately steep boundary and/or interior layers without introducing spurious
unphysical oscillations or excessive smearing of the solution front.

is incorporated into the MCS process for reducing sensing costs while its
quality is guaranteed. Since the sensed data from different cells (sub-areas)
of the target sensing area will probably lead to diverse levels of inference
data quality, cell selection (i.e., choose which cells of the target area to
collect sensed data from participants) is a critical issue that will impact the
total amount of data that requires to be collected (i.e., data collection
costs) for ensuring a certain level of quality. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement learning based Cell selection mechanism for
Sparse MCS, called DR-Cell. First, we properly model the key concepts in
reinforcement learning including state, action, and reward, and then propose to
use a deep recurrent Q-network for learning the Q-function that can help decide
which cell is a better choice under a certain state during cell selection.
Furthermore, we leverage the transfer learning techniques to reduce the amount
of data required for training the Q-function if there are multiple correlated
MCS tasks that need to be conducted in the same target area. Experiments on
various real-life sensing datasets verify the effectiveness of DR-Cell over the
state-of-the-art cell selection mechanisms in Sparse MCS by reducing up to 15%
of sensed cells with the same data inference quality guarantee.

a cost-backlog tradeoff of $[\epsilon,1/\epsilon]$, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Our
approach can be relaxed into multiple timescales to have VNFs (re)placed at a
larger timescale and hence alleviate service interruptions. While proved to
preserve the asymptotic optimality, the larger timescale can slow down the
optimal placement of VNFs. A learn-and-adapt strategy is further designed to
speed the placement up with an improved tradeoff

and formulated an extension of their conjecture, and, recently, Biane and
Cheballah generalized Gog trapezoids further and formulated a related
conjecture. In this paper, we derive constant term formulas for various refined
enumerations of generalized Gog trapezoids including those considered by
Krattenthaler and by Biane and Cheballah. For this purpose we employ a result
on the enumeration of truncated monotone triangles which is in turn based in
the author's operator formula for the number of monotone triangles with
prescribed bottom row. As a byproduct, we also generalize the operator formula
for monotone triangles by including the inversion number and the complementary
inversion number for ASMs. Constant term formulas as well as determinant
formulas for the refined Magog trapezoid numbers that appear in Krattenthaler's

non-intersecting lattice paths and the Lindstr\""om-Gessel-Viennot theorem.

science. A tight criterion under which the \emph{abstract} version LLL (ALLL)

tight for \emph{variable} version LLL (VLLL). Recently, Ambainis et al.
introduced a quantum version LLL (QLLL), which was then shown to be powerful
for quantum satisfiability problem. In this paper, we prove that Shearer's
bound is tight for QLLL, i.e., the relative dimension of the smallest

polynomial, affirming a conjecture proposed by Sattath et al.. Our result also
shows the tightness of Gily{\'e}n and Sattath's algorithm, and implies that the
lattice gas partition function fully characterizes quantum satisfiability for
almost all Hamiltonians with large enough qudits. Commuting LLL (CLLL), LLL for
commuting local Hamiltonians which are widely studied in the literature, is
also investigated here. We prove that the tight regions of CLLL and QLLL are
different in general. Thus, the efficient region of algorithms for CLLL can go
beyond Shearer's bound. In applications of LLLs, the symmetric cases are most
common, i.e., the events are with the same probability and the Hamiltonians are

at most $\left\lceil\frac{d+1}{2}\right\rceil$ distributions are needed. For
bivariate polynomials of degree at most $2d-1$ we find that
$\frac{3d(d-1)}{2}+1$ Gaussian distributions are sufficient. We also treat
polynomial systems with gaps and find, e.g., that for $\{1,x^2,x^3,x^5,x^6\}$ 3
Gaussian distributions are enough for almost all truncated moment sequences.
For log-normal distributions the number is bounded by half of the moment
number. We give an example of continuous functions where more Gaussian
distributions are needed than Dirac delta measures. We show that any inner
truncated moment sequence has a mixture which contains any given distribution.

network size, network topology, and nodes of the original network are unknown.
In this paper we formalize the Adaptive Graph Exploring problem. We assume that
we are given an incomplete snapshot of a large network and additional nodes can
be discovered by querying nodes in the currently observed network. The goal of
this problem is to maximize the number of observed nodes within a given query
budget. Querying which set of nodes maximizes the size of the observed network?
We formulate this problem as an exploration-exploitation problem and propose a
novel nonparametric multi-arm bandit (MAB) algorithm for identifying which
nodes to be queried. Our contributions include: (1) $i$KNN-UCB, a novel
nonparametric MAB algorithm, applies $k$-nearest neighbor UCB to the setting
when the arms are presented in a vector space, (2) provide theoretical
guarantee that $i$KNN-UCB algorithm has sublinear regret, and (3) applying
$i$KNN-UCB algorithm on synthetic networks and real-world networks from
different domains, we show that our method discovers up to 40% more nodes

useful properties of femtosecond pulse interaction with thin films. The
dispersive material is described by a single resonance Lorentz model and its
nonlinear extension with a cubic Duffing-type nonlinearity. A key feature of
the Lorentz dielectric function is that its real part becomes negative between
its zero and its pole, generating a forbidden region. We illustrate numerically
the linear interaction of the pulse with the film using both scattering theory
and Fourier analysis. Outside this region we show the generation of a sequence
of pulses separated by round trips in the Fabry-Perot cavity due to multiple
reflections. When the pulse spectrum is inside the forbidden region, we observe
total reflection. Near the pole of the dielectric function, we demonstrate the
slowing down of the pulse (group velocity tending to zero) in the medium that
behaves as a high-Q cavity. We use the combination of analysis and simulations
in the linear regime to validate the delta function approximation of the thin
layer; this collapses the forbidden region to a single resonant point of the
spectrum. We also study the single cycle pulse interaction with a thin film and
show three distinct types of reflection: half-pulse, sinusoidal wave train and
cosine wavelet. Finally we analyze the influence of a strong nonlinearity and
observe that the film switches from reflecting to trasparent.

regular in the sense that each link is well-described by a spinning rigid
conformation of fixed size that propagates at constant speed along the axis of
rotation. We compute the properties of these links and demonstrate that they
have a simple dependence on the crossing number of the link for a fixed number
of link components. Furthermore, we find that instabilities that exist over
longer timescales in the bulk can be removed by boundary interactions that
yield stable torus links which settle snugly at the medium boundary. The
Borromean rings are used as an example of a non-torus link to demonstrate both
the irregular tumbling dynamics that arises in the bulk and its suppression by
a tight confining medium. Finally, we investigate the collision of torus links

Ancestral inference under Kingman's coalescent has had much attention in the
literature, both in practical data analysis, and from a theoretical and
methodological point of view. Given a sample of individuals taken from the
population at time $t>0$, most contributions have aimed at making frequentist

to ancestral inference. That is, under the prior assumption that the

of $m$ individuals taken from the population at time $t>0$, we estimate
quantities related to the genealogy of an additional unobservable sample of

Bayesian nonparametric estimators (predictors) which can be thought of as
Good-Turing type estimators for ancestral inference. The proposed approach is
illustrated through an application to genetic data.

methods to obtain the coefficients in the expansions. These approximations can
be used as standalone methods for the non-iterative computation of the nodes of
Gauss--Jacobi quadratures of high degree ($n\ge 100$). We also provide
asymptotic approximations for functions related to the first order derivative
of Jacobi polynomials which are used for computing the weights of the
Gauss--Jacobi quadrature. The performance of the asymptotic approximations is
illustrated with numerical examples, and it is shown that nearly double
precision relative accuracy is obtained both for the nodes and the weights when
$n\ge 100$ and $-1< \alpha, \beta\le 5$. For smaller degrees the approximations
are also useful as they provide $10^{-12}$ relative accuracy for the nodes when
$n\ge 20$, and just one Newton step would be sufficient to guarantee double
precision accuracy in that cases.

propose two versions of a trajectory calculus based on the allowed properties
over trajectories, where trajectories are defined as a sequence of
non-overlapping regions of a partitioned map. More specifically, if a given
trajectory is allowed to start and finish at the same region, 6 base relations
are defined (TC-6). If a given trajectory should have different start and
finish regions but cycles are allowed within, 10 base relations are defined
(TC-10). Both versions of the calculus are implemented as ASP programs; we
propose several different encodings, including a generalised program capable of
encoding any qualitative calculus in ASP. All proposed encodings are
experimentally evaluated using a real-world dataset. Experiment results show
that the best performing implementation can scale up to an input of 250
trajectories for TC-6 and 150 trajectories for TC-10 for the problem of
discovering a consistent configuration, a significant improvement compared to
previous ASP implementations for similar qualitative spatial and temporal

outflows from the accretion disc around the accretor. The outflow can be

person re-identification. It handles the body part misalignment problem, that
is, body parts are misaligned across human detections due to pose/viewpoint
change and unreliable detection. Our model consists of a two-stream network
(one stream for appearance map extraction and the other one for body part map
extraction) and a bilinear-pooling layer that generates and spatially pools a
part-aligned map. Each local feature of the part-aligned map is obtained by a
bilinear mapping of the corresponding local appearance and body part
descriptors. Our new representation leads to a robust image matching
similarity, which is equivalent to an aggregation of the local similarities of
the corresponding body parts combined with the weighted appearance similarity.
This part-aligned representation reduces the part misalignment problem
significantly. Our approach is also advantageous over other pose-guided
representations (e.g., extracting representations over the bounding box of each
body part) by learning part descriptors optimal for person re-identification.
For training the network, our approach does not require any part annotation on
the person re-identification dataset. Instead, we simply initialize the part
sub-stream using a pre-trained sub-network of an existing pose estimation
network, and train the whole network to minimize the re-identification loss. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach by demonstrating its superiority
over the state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark datasets, including
Market-1501, CUHK03, CUHK01 and DukeMTMC, and standard video dataset MARS.

when $\epsilon_r$ is real, to the first order in $\epsilon_r$, the band
structures show a phase transition from an exact phase with real quasienergies
to a broken phase with complex quasienergies inside a region of wave vector
space, the so-called k-gap. We show that the two EPs at the upper and lower
edges of the k-gap have opposite chiralities in the stroboscopic sense. Thus,
by picking up the mode with a positive imaginary quasienergy, the wave
propagation inside the k-gap can grow exponentially. In three dimensions, such
pairs of EPs span two concentric spherical surfaces in the $\vec{k}$ space and
repeat themselves periodically in the quasienergy space with Omega as the
period. However, in the case when $\epsilon_r$ is pure imaginary, the k-gap
disappears and gaps in the quasienergy space are opened. Our analytical results
agree well with the finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. To the
second order in $\epsilon_r$, additional EP pairs are found for both the cases
of real and imaginary $\epsilon_r$.

question-answering systems change how humans interact with information systems:
users can now ask specific questions and obtain a tailored answer - both
conveniently in natural language. Despite obvious benefits, their use is often
limited to an academic context, largely because of expensive domain
customizations, which means that the performance in domain-specific
applications often fails to meet expectations. This paper proposes
cost-efficient remedies: (i) we leverage metadata through a filtering
mechanism, which increases the precision of document retrieval, and (ii) we
develop a novel fuse-and-oversample approach for transfer learning in order to
improve the performance of answer extraction. Here knowledge is inductively
transferred from a related, yet different, tasks to the domain-specific
application, while accounting for potential differences in the sample sizes
across both tasks. The resulting performance is demonstrated with actual use
cases from a finance company and the film industry, where fewer than 400
question-answer pairs had to be annotated in order to yield significant
performance gains. As a direct implication to management, this presents a
promising path to better leveraging of knowledge stored in information systems.

Iterative Thresholding and K-residual Means (ITKrM) algorithm. On one hand it
is proved that ITKrM is a contraction under much more relaxed conditions than
previously necessary. On the other hand it is shown that there seem to exist
stable fixed points that do not correspond to the generating dictionary, which
can be characterised as very coherent. Based on an analysis of the residuals
using these bad dictionaries, replacing coherent atoms with carefully designed
replacement candidates is proposed. In experiments on synthetic data this
outperforms random or no replacement and always leads to full dictionary
recovery. Finally the question how to learn dictionaries without knowledge of
the correct dictionary size and sparsity level is addressed. Decoupling the
replacement strategy of coherent or unused atoms into pruning and adding, and
slowly carefully increasing the sparsity level, leads to an adaptive version of
ITKrM. In several experiments this adaptive dictionary learning algorithm is
shown to recover a generating dictionary from randomly initialised dictionaries
of various sizes on synthetic data and to learn meaningful dictionaries on
image data.

the Lanczos method. We illustrate the performance of the new methods on several

games. Intuitively, the players enter the game sequentially and choose an
optimal action under the assumption that the $k-1$ subsequent players play
subgame-perfectly. Our model naturally interpolates between outcomes of greedy
best-response ($k=1$) and subgame-perfect outcomes ($k=n$, the number of
players). We study the impact of limited lookahead (parameterized by $k$) on
the stability and inefficiency of the resulting outcomes. As our results
reveal, increased lookahead does not necessarily lead to better outcomes; in
fact, its effect crucially depends on the existence of ties and the type of
game under consideration.
  More specifically, already for very simple network congestion games we show
that subgame-perfect outcomes (full lookahead) can be unstable, whereas greedy
best-response outcomes (no lookahead) are known to be stable. We show that this
instability is due to player indifferences (ties). If the game is generic (no
ties exist) then all outcomes are stable, independent of the lookahead $k$. In
particular, this implies that the price of anarchy of $k$-lookahead outcomes
(for arbitrary $k$) equals the standard price of anarchy. For special cases of
cost-sharing games and consensus games we show that no lookahead leads to
stable outcomes. Again this can be resolved by removing ties, though for
cost-sharing games only full lookahead provides stable outcomes. We also
identify a class of generic cost-sharing games for which the inefficiency
decreases as the lookahead $k$ increases.

since species with good local survival chances have more time to colonize new
habitats and species inhabiting large areas have higher chances to survive
local disturbances. Yet, both distributions have been discussed in mostly
separate communities. Here, we study both patterns simultaneously using a
spatially explicit, evolutionary community assembly approach. We present and
investigate a metacommunity model, consisting of a grid of patches, where each
patch contains a local food web. Species survival depends on predation and
competition interactions, which in turn depend on species body masses as the
key traits. The system evolves due to the migration of species to neighboring
patches, the addition of new species as modifications of existing species, and
local extinction events. The structure of each local food web thus emerges in a
self-organized manner as the highly non-trivial outcome of the relative time
scales of these processes. Our model generates a large variety of complex,
multi-trophic networks and therefore serves as a powerful tool to investigate
ecosystems on long temporal and large spatial scales. We find that the observed
lifetime distributions and species-area relations resemble power laws over
appropriately chosen parameter ranges and thus agree qualitatively with
empirical findings. Moreover, we observe strong finite-size effects, and a
dependence of the relationships on the trophic level of the species. By
comparing our results to simple neutral models found in the literature, we

information for noncoherent communication (i.e., in which neither transmitter
nor receiver are cognizant of the fading state) over a frequency-flat fading
channel with additive noise. Our bound yields positive (non-trivial) values
even in the most challenging case of zero-mean fast fading, a regime in which
the conventional approach of orthogonal time-multiplexed pilots is unavailing
and for which, to the best of the author's knowledge, no simple analytical
bound is known. Its derivation relies on endowing the transmit signal with a
non-zero mean, which can be interpreted as a pilot symbol that is additively
superimposed onto the information-bearing Gaussian signal. The optimal fraction
of transmit power that one should dedicate to this pilot is computed in closed
form and shown to tend to one half at low SNR and to a limit above $2-\sqrt{2}
\approx 0.586$ at high SNR. We further show how one can refine the bound for
the general case of non-zero mean fading. Finally, we state an extension of our
bound to the MIMO setting and apply it to compare superimposed vs. orthogonal
pilots on the SISO Rayleigh block fading channel.

the optimal transport methodology of \cite{span} is used, which directly
approximates our strategy. We show that our theoretical improvements are

in a wide momentum range, through the relation between the particle velocity
and the Cherenkov angle. However, since the Cherenkov angle depends only on
material's permittivity, the material unavoidably sets a fundamental limit to
the momentum coverage and sensitivity of Cherenkov detectors. For example, Ring
Imaging Cherenkov detectors must employ materials transparent to the frequency
of interest as well as possessing permittivities close to unity to identify
particles in the multi GeV range, and thus are often limited to large gas
chambers. It would be extremely important albeit challenging to lift this
fundamental limit and control Cherenkov angles as preferred. Here we propose a
new mechanism that uses constructive interference of resonance transition
radiation from photonic crystals to generate both forward and backward
Cherenkov radiation. This mechanism can control Cherenkov angles in a flexible
way with high sensitivity to any desired range of velocities. Photonic crystals
thus overcome the severe material limit for Cherenkov detectors, enabling the
use of transparent materials with arbitrary values of permittivity, and provide
a promising option suited for identification of particles at high energy with
enhanced sensitivity.

superimposed on a long-term trend. The light curve shape and timescale change
from cycle to cycle. There are temperature variations characteristic for
pulsations, and brightness oscillations with no significant change of color are
also observed. The UBV data for the 2009-2011 interval are well reproduced by a
superposition of two periodic components with P=170 d and P=141 d (or P=217 d -
the one year alias of P=141 d). The variation became less regular after 2011,
the timescale increased and exceeded 250 days. In 2009-2016 the annual average
brightness monotonically increased in V, J, K, whereas it decreased in U and B.
The annual average U-B, B-V, and J-K colors grew, the star was getting redder.
The cooling and expanding of the star photosphere along with the increasing of
luminosity may explain the long-term trend in brightness and colors. Based on
our photometric data we suppose that the photosphere temperature decreased by
~400 K in the 2008-2016 interval, the radius increased by ~24 %, and the

explained by magnetic reconnection ($t\propto E^{1/3}$). In this study, we
carried out a statistical research on 50 solar WLFs with SDO/HMI to examine the

parallel application's computational tasks to the processing elements (PEs) of
a parallel computer.
  The idea behind our method \mswap is to enhance such a mapping by drawing on
the observation that many topologies take the form of a partial cube.
  This class of graphs includes all rectangular and cubic meshes, any such
torus with even extensions in each dimension, all hypercubes, and all trees.
  Following previous work, we represent the parallel application and the
parallel computer by graphs $G_a = (V_a, E_a)$ and $G_p = (V_p, E_p)$.
  $G_p$ being a partial cube allows us to label its vertices, the PEs, by
bitvectors such that the cost of exchanging one unit of information between two
vertices $u_p$ and $v_p$ of $G_p$ amounts to the Hamming distance between the
labels of $u_p$ and $v_p$.
  By transferring these bitvectors from $V_p$ to $V_a$ via $\mu^{-1}(\cdot)$
and extending them to be unique on $V_a$, we can enhance $\mu(\cdot)$ by
swapping labels of $V_a$ in a new way.
  Pairs of swapped labels are local \wrt the PEs, but not \wrt $G_a$. Moreover,
permutations of the bitvectors' entries give rise to a plethora of hierarchies
on the PEs. Through these hierarchies we turn \mswap into a hierarchical method
for improving $\mu(\cdot)$ that is complementary to state-of-the-art methods
for computing $\mu(\cdot)$ in the first place.
  In our experiments we use \mswap to enhance mappings of complex networks onto
rectangular meshes and tori with 256 and 512 nodes, as well as hypercubes with
256 nodes. It turns out that common quality measures of mappings derived from
state-of-the-art algorithms can be improved considerably.

cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More advanced error

introduce the CPCT+ algorithm, and an implementation of that algorithm, that
address these issues. First, CPCT+ reports the complete set of minimum cost
repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one
that best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world
syntactically invalid Java programs, CPCT+ is able to repair 98.37% of files
within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally, CPCT+ uses the complete set of minimum cost
repair sequences to reduce the cascading error problem, where incorrect error
recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified. Across the
test corpus, CPCT+ reports 435,812 error locations to the user, reducing the
cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628 error locations

about 50 days after the gamma-ray detection due to proximity to the Sun. The
nova speed class is unknown because of lack of the earliest half of optical
light curve and short supersoft X-ray phase due to eclipse by the disk rim.
Using the universal decline law and time-stretching method, we analyzed the
data of V959 Mon and obtained nova parameters. We estimated the distance
modulus in the V band to be (m-M)_V=13.15\pm0.3 for the reddening of
E(B-V)=0.38\pm0.01 by directly comparing with the similar type of novae, LV
Vul, V1668 Cyg, IV Cep, and V1065 Cen. The distance to V959 Mon is 2.5\pm0.5
kpc. If we assume that the early phase light curve of V959 Mon is the same as
that of time-stretched light curves of LV Vul, our model light curve fitting
suggests that the white dwarf (WD) mass is 0.9-1.15 M_sun, being consistent
with a neon nova identification. At the time of gamma-ray detection the
photosphere of nova envelope extends to 5-8 R_sun (about two or three times the
binary separation) and the wind mass-loss rate is (3-4)\times 10^{-5} M_sun
yr^{-1}. The period of hard X-ray emission is consistent with the time of
appearance of the companion star from the nova envelope. The short supersoft
X-ray turnoff time is consistent with the epoch when the WD photosphere shrank
to behind the elevating disk rim, that occurs 500 days before nuclear burning
turned off.

measurement between CMB and LSS observation. In this paper we show that
$\sigma_8-\Omega_m$ observations can be used to test the dark energy theories.
We study two models, (1) Hu-Sawicki(HS) Model of $f(R)$ gravity and (2)
Chavallier-Polarski-Linder(CPL) parametrization of dynamical dark energy (DDE),
both of which satisfy the constraints from supernovae. We compute $\sigma_8$
consistent with the parameters of these models. We find that the well known
tension in $\sigma_8$ between Planck CMB and large scale structure (LSS)
observations is (1) exacerbated in the HS model and (2) somewhat alleviated in
the DDE model. We illustrate the importance of the $\sigma_8$ measurements for
testing modified gravity models. Modified gravity models change the matter
power spectrum at cluster scale which also depends upon the neutrino mass. We
present the bound on neutrino mass in the HS and DDE model.

frequencies and train the classifier of choice on balanced data. For two-class
imbalanced problems, the classification success is typically measured by the
geometric mean (GM) of the true positive and true negative rates. Here we prove
that GM can be improved upon by instance selection, and give the theoretical
conditions for such an improvement. We demonstrate that GM is non-monotonic
with respect to the number of retained instances, which discourages systematic
instance selection. We also show that balancing the distribution frequencies is
inferior to a direct maximisation of GM. To verify our theoretical findings, we
carried out an experimental study of 12 instance selection methods for
imbalanced data, using 66 standard benchmark data sets. The results reveal
possible room for new instance selection methods for imbalanced data.

methods for protocol analysis focus only on the protocols, without being
sensitive to assumptions about their environments. LPA is a tool which analyzes
protocols in context. LPA uses two programs, cooperating with each other: CPSA,
a well-known system for protocol analysis, and Razor, a model-finder based on
SMT technology. Our analysis follows the enrich-by-need paradigm, in which
models of protocol execution are generated and examined. The choice of which
models to generate is important, and we motivate and evaluate LPA's strategy of
building minimal models. ""Minimality"" can be defined with respect to either of
two preorders, namely the homomorphism preorder and the embedding preorder
(i.e. the preorder of injective homomorphisms); we discuss the merits of each.
Our main technical contributions are algorithms for building
homomorphism-minimal models and for generating a set-of-support for the models
of a theory, in each case by scripting interactions with an SMT solver.

experiment in the early history of modern physics that illustrates the
relationship between magnetism and angular momentum. Today the effect is still
discussed in elementary physics courses to demonstrate that the angular
momentum associated with the aligned electron spins in a ferromagnet can be
converted to mechanical angular momentum by reversing the direction of
magnetisation using an external magnetic field. In recent times, a related
problem in magnetism concerns the time-scale over which this angular momentum
transfer can occur. It is known experimentally for several metallic
ferromagnets that intense photoexcitation leads to a drop in the magnetisation
on a time scale shorter than 100 fs, a phenomenon called ultrafast
demagnetisation. The microscopic mechanism for this process has been hotly
debated, with one key question still unanswered: where does the angular
momentum go on these sub-picosecond time scales? Here we show using femtosecond
time-resolved x-ray diffraction that a large fraction of the angular momentum
lost from the spin system on the laserinduced demagnetisation of ferromagnetic
iron is transferred to the lattice on sub-picosecond timescales, manifesting as
a transverse strain wave that propagates from the surface into the bulk. By
fitting a simple model of the x-ray data to simulations and optical data, we
roughly estimate that the angular momentum occurs on a time scale of 200 fs and
corresponds to 80% of the angular momentum lost from the spin system. Our
results show that interaction with the lattice plays an essential role in the
process of ultrafast demagnetisation in this system.

the light polarization. This allows for a gradual transition from continuous

planner and dynamically stable confirmed by phonon band structure. Young
modulus of the sheet is 275N/m. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations show
that the C3NH sheet can be stable at 1000K indicating a high melting point.
Tensile strain reduces the band gap of the sheet and electron effective mass.
In return, hole effective mass is strongly dependent on the strain direction so
that strain along zigzag (armchair) increases (reduces) hole effective mass.
our findings show that C3NH sheet is a promising candidate for electronic and
optoelectronic applications and strain engineering can be used to tune its

of scale breaking in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. We start with
a light scalar field that is conformally coupled to a toy SM matter sector
through a Weyl rescaling of the metric. After appropriately normalizing the
fields, the conformally coupled scalar only interacts directly with the
would-be Higgs field through kinetic-mixing and Higgs-portal terms. Thus, for
the first time, we describe the equivalence of conformally coupled
scalar-tensor modifications of gravity and Higgs-portal theories, and we find
that the usual tree-level fifth forces only emerge if there is mass mixing
between the conformally coupled scalar and the Higgs field. The strength of the
fifth force, mediated by the light scalar, then depends on whether the mass of
the Higgs arises from an explicit symmetry-breaking term or a spontaneous
mechanism of scale breaking. Solar System tests of gravity and the
non-observation of fifth forces therefore have the potential to provide
information about the structure of the Higgs sector and the origin of its
symmetry breaking, setting an upper bound on the magnitude of any explicit
scale-breaking terms. These results demonstrate the phenomenological importance

  Paleo-records",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  African dust exhibits strong variability on a range of time scales. Here we
show that the interhemispheric contrast in Atlantic SST (ICAS) drives African
dust variability on interannual, multidecadal, and millennial timescales, and a
strong anthropogenic decline of African dust in the future can be expected due
to the projected increase of the ICAS. During the recent past, the ICAS is
found to significantly correlate with various dust observations and proxies
that extend as far back as 1851. Physically, positive ICAS anomalies induce
large-scale circulation changes that push the Intertropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ) northward and decrease surface wind speed over African dust source
regions, which reduces dust emission and transport to the tropical Atlantic.
The ICAS-ITCZ-dust relationship also finds robust support from paleo-climate
observations that span the last 17,000 years. The ICAS drive of African dust
variability is consistent with documented relationships between dust activity
and Sahel precipitation6, the North Atlantic Oscillation7, and time series of a
surface wind speed pattern over Northern Africa8, and offers a unified
framework to understand them. The ICAS-dust connection implies that human
activities that change ICAS through emitting greenhouse gases and pollutions
have affected and will continue to affect African dust. Climate models project
that anthropogenic increase of the ICAS can push the ICAS value to surpass the
highest level attained during the Holocene by the end of this century and
decrease African dust activity by as much as 60% off its current level, which
has broad consequences for aspects of the climate in the North Atlantic region
and beyond.

the corresponding mean-field parameter. If magnetic anisotropy of particles is
additionally taken into account and if the distribution of the particles' easy
axes is random and uniform, then the cluster equilibrium response is even
weaker. The decrease of the magnetization with increasing anisotropy constant
is more pronounced at large applied fields. The phenomenological generalization
of the modified mean-field theory, that correctly describes this effect for

direction by parametric pumping. As evidenced by our micromagnetic simulations,
skyrmions can hardly be driven by either a static electric field or a static
magnetic field alone. Although the magnetic anisotropy can be modified by an
electric field, parametric pumping with an oscillating electric field can only
excite the breathing modes. On the other hand, a static magnetic field can
break rotational symmetry through the Zeeman interaction, but it cannot serve
as an energy source for propelling a skyrmion. Here we found that the
combination of a perpendicularly oscillating electric field and an in-plane
static magnetic field can drive a skyrmion undergoing a wiggling motion along a
well defined trajectory. The most efficient driving occurs when the frequency
of the oscillating field is close to that of the breathing motion. The physics
is revealed in a generalized Thiele equation where a net spin current excited
by the parametric pumping can drive the skyrmion propagation through angular
momentum transfer. Compared with other alternative proposals, our results open
new possibilities for manipulating skyrmions in both metals and insulators with
low-power consumption. The oscillating skyrmion motion can also be a microwave

testing whether whether two random vectors $X$ and $Y$ are independent, given

vector). In this paper, we prove that conditional independence is indeed a
particularly difficult hypothesis to test for. Valid statistical tests are
required to have a size that is smaller than a predefined significance level,
and different tests usually have power against a different class of
alternatives. We prove that a valid test for conditional independence does not
have power against any alternative.
  Given the non-existence of a uniformly valid conditional independence test,
we argue that tests must be designed so their suitability for a particular
problem may be judged easily. To address this need, we propose in the case
where $X$ and $Y$ are univariate to nonlinearly regress $X$ on $Z$, and $Y$ on
$Z$ and then compute a test statistic based on the sample covariance between
the residuals, which we call the generalised covariance measure (GCM). We prove
that validity of this form of test relies almost entirely on the weak
requirement that the regression procedures are able to estimate the conditional
means $X$ given $Z$, and $Y$ given $Z$, at a slow rate. We extend the
methodology to handle settings where $X$ and $Y$ may be multivariate or even
high-dimensional. While our general procedure can be tailored to the setting at
hand by combining it with any regression technique, we develop the theoretical
guarantees for kernel ridge regression. A simulation study shows that the test
based on GCM is competitive with state of the art conditional independence
tests. Code is available as the R package GeneralisedCovarianceMeasure on CRAN.

that as the turbulent flow evolves in time, the Rossby number decreases to

columnar structures arising due to the inverse cascade of energy. We establish
that a major fraction of energy is confined in Fourier modes $(\pm1,0,0)$ and
$(0,\pm1,0)$ that correspond to the largest columnar structure in the flow. For
wavenumbers ($k$) greater than the enstrophy dissipation wavenumber ($k_d$),
our phenomenological arguments and numerical study show that the enstrophy flux
and spectrum of a horizontal cross-section perpendicular to the axis of
rotation are given by $\epsilon_\omega\exp(-C(k/k_d)^2)$ and
$C\epsilon_\omega^{2/3}k^{-1}\exp(-C(k/k_d)^2)$ respectively; for this 2D flow,
$\epsilon_\omega$ is the enstrophy dissipation rate, and $C$ is a constant.

$E(k)=C\epsilon_\omega^{2/3}k^{-3}\exp(-C(k/k_d)^2)$. This model of the energy

1]$. At even times a random number Y of species is removed, killing the species
with lower fitness. We show that there is a critical fitness $f_c$ below which
the number of species hits zero i.o. and above of which this number goes to
infinity. We prove uniform convergence for the distribution of surviving
species and describe the phenomena which could not be observed in previous
works with uniformly distributed fitness.

and allows stability to be enforced so that blocks can be unrolled adaptively
to a pattern-dependent processing depth. NAIS-Net induces non-trivial,
Lipschitz input-output maps, even for an infinite unroll length. We prove that
the network is globally asymptotically stable so that for every initial
condition there is exactly one input-dependent equilibrium assuming $tanh$

spiral arms and merger events extends out to the Solar neighborhood. Their
measured power spectrum has a characteristic amplitude of 11 \kms{} on a scale

implications for determining the Sun's motion about the Galactic Centre. Using
Red Clump stars from \glh{} and \apg{}, we map the line-of-sight velocities
around the Sun (d$<$5 kpc), and $|z|<$1.25 kpc from the midplane. By
subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model for the velocity field, we study the

volume completeness). Using a flexible axisymmetric model the power-amplitude
is further reduced to 6.3 \kms{}. Additionally, our simulations show that, in
the plane, distances are underestimated for high-mass Red Clump stars which can
lead to spurious power-amplitude of about 5.2 \kms{}. Taking this into account,

the hyperfine interaction that rules the high frequency NSB characteristics.
Here, we first study the overall coherence decay and rephasings in a
hyperfine-driven NSB through the temporal and spectral behaviors of the
so-called Loschmidt echo (LE). Its dependence on the NSB size, initial
polarization, and coupling inhomogeneity are separately investigated, which
leads to a simple phenomenological expression that can accommodate all of these
attributes. Unlike the prevailing emphasis on spin 1/2, the NSBs with larger
spin quantum numbers are equally considered. For this case, additionally the
effect of nuclear electric quadrupole interaction is taken into account where
its biaxiality term is influential on the decoherence. The insights gained from
model systems are then put to use for two generic realistic semiconductor
systems, namely, a donor center and a quantum dot that represent small and
large nanoscale NSB examples, respectively. The spectrum of LE for large
quantum dots can reach the 100~MHz range, whereas, for donor centers, it
reduces to a few MHz, making them readily amenable for dynamical decoupling
techniques. The effect of quadrupole interaction on LE is seen to be negligible
for large quantum dots, while it becomes significant for donor centers, most
notably in the form of depolarizing a polarized NSB.

blocked by these so-called eclipsing DLAs, narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission from the

trough. We define a statistical sample of 399 eclipsing DLAs with
log$N$(HI)$\ge$21.10. We divide our statistical sample into three subsamples
based on the strength of the NEL detected in the DLA trough. By studying the
stacked spectra of these subsamples, we found that absorption from high
ionization species are stronger in DLAs with stronger NEL in their absorption
core. Moreover, absorption from the excited states of species like SiII are
also stronger in DLAs with stronger NEL. We also found no correlation between

observations are consistent with a scenario in which the DLAs with stronger NEL

either opinion blue or red; then, in each round, each agent looks at two random
neighbors and, if the two have the same opinion, the agent adopts it. This
process is known as the 2-Choices dynamics and is arguably the most basic
non-trivial opinion dynamics modeling voting behavior on social networks.
Despite its apparent simplicity, 2-Choices has been analytically characterized
only on restricted network classes---under assumptions on the initial
configuration that establish it as a fast majority consensus protocol.
  In this work, we aim at contributing to the understanding of the 2-Choices
dynamics by considering its behavior on a class of networks with core-periphery
structure, a well-known topological assumption in social networks. In a
nutshell, assume that a densely-connected subset of agents, the core, holds a
different opinion from the rest of the network, the periphery. Then, depending
on the strength of the cut between the core and the periphery, a
phase-transition phenomenon occurs: Either the core's opinion rapidly spreads
among the rest of the network, or a metastability phase takes place, in which
both opinions coexist in the network for superpolynomial time. The interest of
our result is twofold. On the one hand, by looking at the 2-Choices dynamics as
a simplistic model of competition among opinions in social networks, our
theorem sheds light on the influence of the core on the rest of the network, as
a function of the core's connectivity toward the latter. On the other hand, we
provide one of the first analytical results which shows a heterogeneous
behavior of a simple dynamics as a function of structural parameters of the
network. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with extensive
experiments on real networks.

grows when the intermediate region between near and far zone is approached. In
the far zone, we find that the energy transfer amplitude is strongly suppressed
by the waveguide, becoming virtually zero. A physical interpretation of these
results is discussed. Finally, we discuss the resonance interaction energy and
force between two identical correlated atoms in the waveguide, one excited and
the other in the ground state, prepared in their symmetric or antisymmetric
superposition.

meteorites to their pre-impact, heliocentric orbits and ultimately to their

25 meteorite falls published to date from original data sources. Using these
orbits, we constrain their most likely escape routes from the main asteroid
belt and the cometary region by utilizing a state-of-the-art orbit model of the
near-Earth-object population, which includes a size-dependence in delivery
efficiency. While we find that our general results for escape routes are
comparable to previous work, the role of trajectory measurement uncertainty in
escape-route identification is explored for the first time. Moreover, our
improved size-dependent delivery model substantially changes likely escape
routes for several meteorite falls, most notably Tagish Lake which seems
unlikely to have originated in the outer main belt as previously suggested. We
find that reducing the uncertainty of fireball velocity measurements below
$\sim0.1$ km/s does not lead to reduced uncertainties in the identification of
their escape routes from the asteroid belt and, further, their ultimate source

the largest possible number of meteorite recoveries with measured speed
precisions of order 0.1 km/s.

because they capture the situation when each evolutionary trait emerges only
once in history; if such events are believed to be rare, then by Occam's Razor
such parsimonious trees are preferable as a hypothesis of evolution. A
classical result states that 2-state characters permit a perfect phylogeny
precisely if each subset of 2 characters permits one. More recently, it was
shown that for 3-state characters the same property holds but for size-3
subsets. A long-standing open problem asked whether such a constant exists for
each number of states. More precisely, it has been conjectured that for any
fixed integer $r$, there exists a constant $f(r)$ such that a set of $r$-state

$f(r)$ characters has a perfect phylogeny. In this paper, we show that this

results in improved estimates of the probability density function (pdf) for a
scalar quantity of interest. The approach utilizes Gaussian process regression
to perform Bayesian inference on the parameter-to-observation map describing
the quantity of interest. We then approximate the desired pdf along with
uncertainty bounds utilizing the posterior distribution of the inferred map.
The 'next-best' design point is sequentially determined through an optimization
procedure that selects the point in parameter space that maximally reduces
uncertainty between the estimated bounds of the pdf prediction. Since the
optimization process utilizes only information from the inferred map it has
minimal computational cost. Moreover, the special form of the metric emphasizes
the tails of the pdf. The method is practical for systems where the
dimensionality of the parameter space is of moderate size, i.e. order O(10). We
apply the method to estimate the extreme event statistics for a very
high-dimensional system with millions of degrees of freedom: an offshore
platform subjected to three-dimensional irregular waves. It is demonstrated

beam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves
observed in several astrophysical plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of
electron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless,
unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot
suprathermal electrons (modeled by a $\kappa$-type distribution), and
stationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A
linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave
structures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam
velocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to
obtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate
how their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties
of the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $\kappa$) of the hot
electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the
electron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity
solitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the
solitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes
narrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the

  numbers within the arithmetic progressions 1+6n and 5+6n",,,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article I present results from a statistical study of prime numbers
that shows a behaviour that is not compatible with the thesis that they are
distributed randomly. The analysis is based on studying two arithmetical
progressions defined by the following polynomials: ($1+6n$, $5+6n$, $n\in{N}$)
whose respective numerical sequences have the characteristic of containing all
the prime numbers except $3$ and $2$. If prime numbers were distributed
randomly, we would expect the two polynomials to generate the same number of
primes. Instead, as the reported findings show, we note that the polynomial
$5+6n$ tends to generate many more primes, and that this divergence grows
progressively as more prime numbers are considered. A possible explanation for
this phenomenon can be found by calculating the number of products that
generate composite numbers which are expressible by the two polynomials. This
analysis reveals that the number of products that generate composite numbers
expressible by the polynomial $1+6n$ is $(n+1)^{ 2}$, while the number of
products that generate composites expressible by the polynomial $5+6n$ is
$(n+1)n$, con $n\in{N}$. As a composite number is a non-prime number, this
difference incited me to analyse the distribution of prime numbers generated by
the two polynomials. The results, based on studying the first (approx.) 500
million prime numbers, confirm the fact that the number of primes that can be
written using the polynomial $1+6n$ is lower than the number of primes that can
written using the polynomial $5+6n$, and that this divergence grows
progressively with the number of primes considered.

becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot

classification. Complementary to prior studies, MoVAE represents a shift of
paradigm in comparison with the usual one-shot learning methods, as it does not
use any prior knowledge. Instead, it starts from zero knowledge and one labeled
sample per class. Afterward, by using unlabeled data and the generalization
learning concept (in a way, more as humans do), it is capable to gradually
improve by itself its performance. Even more, if there are no unlabeled data
available MoVAE can still perform well in one-shot learning classification. We
demonstrate empirically the efficiency of our proposed approach on three
datasets, i.e. the handwritten digits (MNIST), fashion products
(Fashion-MNIST), and handwritten characters (Omniglot), showing that MoVAE
outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot learning algorithms.

with per user power constraints whilst the rate of the real-time users (RTUs)
meet their target rates. First an approximated uplink user rate is derived
based on available channel statistics. Next, the original mixed QoS problem is
formulated in terms of receiver filter coefficients and user power allocations

Based on dimensionless signals moving on the real line, they model
particle/signal dynamics in Cellular Automata. Each particle, or signal, moves
at constant speed in continuous time and space. When signals meet, they get
replaced by other signals. A signal machine defines the types of available
signals, their speeds and the rules for replacement in collision. A signal
machine A simulates another one B if all the space-time diagrams of B can be
generated from space-time diagrams of A by removing some signals and renaming
other signals according to local information. Given any finite set of speeds S,
we construct a signal machine that is able to simulate any signal machine whose
speeds belong to S. Each signal is simulated by a macro-signal, a ray of
parallel signals. Each macro-signal has a main signal located exactly where the
simulated signal would be, as well as auxiliary signals which encode its id and
the collision rules of the simulated machine. The simulation of a collision, a
macro-collision, consists of two phases. In the first phase, macro-signals are
shrunk, then the macro-signals involved in the collision are identified and it
is ensured that no other macro-signal comes too close. If some do, the process
is aborted and the macro-signals are shrunk, so that the correct
macro-collision will eventually be restarted and successfully initiated.
Otherwise, the second phase starts: the appropriate collision rule is found and
new macro-signals are generated accordingly. Considering all finite set of
speeds S and their corresponding simulators provides an intrinsically universal
family of signal machines.

reduce the computational expense and improve the accuracy of modeling. In this
study, a new framework of modeling is suggested. Compared with other popular
methods, a distinctive characteristic is ""from image based model to analysis
based model (e.g. stress, strain, and deformation)"". In such a framework, a
reconstruction neural network (ReConNN) model designed for simulation-based
physical field's reconstruction is proposed. The ReConNN contains two submodels
that are convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial net-work
(GAN). The CNN is employed to construct the mapping between contour images of
physical field and objective function. Subsequently, the GAN is utilized to
generate more images which are similar to the existing contour images. Finally,
Lagrange polynomial is applied to complete the reconstruction. However, the
existing CNN models are commonly applied to the classification tasks, which
seem to be difficult to handle with regression tasks of images. Meanwhile, the
existing GAN architectures are insufficient to generate high-accuracy ""pseudo

Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN-CAE) is suggested. To evaluate the
