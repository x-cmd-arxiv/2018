determining if a graph admits a cluster structure. We say that a graph is $(k,
\phi)$-clusterable if it can be partitioned into at most $k$ parts such that
each part has conductance at least $\phi$. We present an algorithm that accepts
all graphs that are $(2, \phi)$-clusterable with probability at least
$\frac{2}3$ and rejects all graphs that are $\epsilon$-far from $(2,
\phi^*)$-clusterable for $\phi^* \le \mu \phi^2 \epsilon^2$ with probability at
least $\frac{2}3$ where $\mu > 0$ is a parameter that affects the query
complexity. This improves upon the work of Czumaj, Peng, and Sohler by removing
a $\log n$ factor from the denominator of the bound on $\phi^*$ for the case of
$k=2$. Our work was concurrent with the work of Chiplunkar et al.\@ who
achieved the same improvement for all values of $k$. Our approach for the case
$k=2$ relies on the geometric structure of the eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian and results in an algorithm with query complexity $O(n^{1/2+O(1)\mu}

at least one of the following features: turbulence, shocks, and/or material
interfaces. While seemingly different phenomena, these flows all share
continuous generation of high wavenumber modes, which we term the '$k_\infty$
irregularity.' In this work, an inviscid regularization technique called
'observable regularization' is proposed for the simulation of two-phase
compressible flows. The proposed approach regularizes the equations at the
level of the partial differential equation and as a result, any numerical
method can be used to solve the system of equations. The regularization is
accomplished by introducing an 'observability limit' that represents the length
scale below which one cannot properly model or continue to resolve flow
structures. An observable volume fraction equation is derived for capturing the
material interface, which satisfies the pressure equilibrium at the interface.
The efficacy of the observable regularization method is demonstrated using
several test cases, including a one-dimensional material interface tracking,
one-dimensional shock-tube and shock-bubble problems, and two-dimensional
simulations of a shock interacting with a cylindrical bubble. The results show
favorable agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with available
exact solutions or numerical and experimental data from the literature. The
computational saving by using the current method is estimated to be about one
order of magnitude in two-dimensional computations and significantly higher in
three-dimensional computations. Lastly, the effect of the observability limit
and best practices to choose its value are discussed.

forms of intentional but ""nonstrategic"" behavior: typically, that strategic
agents model other agents while nonstrategic agents do not. However, a crisp
boundary between these concepts has proven elusive. This problem is pervasive
throughout the game theoretic literature on bounded rationality and
particularly critical in parts of the behavioral game theory literature that
make an explicit distinction between the behavior of ""nonstrategic"" level-0
agents and ""strategic"" higher-level agents (e.g., the level-k and cognitive
hierarchy models). Overall, work discussing bounded rationality rarely gives
clear guidance on how the rationality of nonstrategic agents must be bounded,
instead typically just singling out specific decision rules (e.g., randomizing
uniformly, playing toward the best case, optimizing the worst case) and
informally asserting that they are nonstrategic. In this work, we propose a
new, formal characterization of nonstrategic behavior. Our main contribution is
to show that it satisfies two properties: (1) it is general enough to capture
all purportedly ""nonstrategic"" decision rules of which we are aware in the
behavioral game theory literature; (2) behavior that obeys our characterization
is distinct from strategic behavior in a precise sense.

are driven by variations in the ionizing continuum flux --which are usually
reflected in the observable UV-optical continuum. The ""Reverberation mapping""
technique measures the delay between line and continuum variations to determine
the size of the line emitting region, this is the basis for measurements of the
central black hole mass in AGNs. The Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation
Mapping Project (AGN STORM) on NGC 5548 in 2014 is the most intensive
multi-wavelength AGN monitoring campaign ever. For most of the campaign, the
emission-line variations followed changes in the continuum with a time lag, as
expected. However, the lines varied independently of the observed UV-optical
continuum during a 60 -- 70 day ""holiday."" To understand this remarkable
phenomenon, we study the intrinsic absorption lines present in NGC 5548. We
identify a novel cycle that reproduces the absorption line variability and thus
identify the physics that allows the holiday to occur. In our model, variations
in this obscurer's line-of-sight covering factor modify the soft X-ray
continuum. This leads to changes in the ionization of helium gas in the
broad-line region. Ionizing radiation produced by recombining helium then
affects the ionization of other species as observed during the AGN STORM
holiday. It is likely that any other model which selectively changes the soft
X-ray part of the continuum during the holiday can also explain the anomalous
emission line behavior observed.

antiferromagnet, the domain state is subject to reversal. Although the initial
and final conditions are saturated single-domain states, the process of
reversal may decompose into local multi-domain switching events. In thin films
of Cr2O3, the magnetoelectric coercivity and the switching speed found from
experiments are considerably lower than expected from magnetic anisotropy,
similar to Brown's paradox in ferromagnetic materials. Multi-domain effects
originate because antiferromagnetic domain walls are metastably pinned by
lattice defects, not due to reduction of magnetostatic energy, which is
negligible. This paper theoretically analyzes domain reversal in thin-film
magnetoelectric antiferromagnets in the form of nucleation, domain wall
propagation, and coherent rotation. The timescales of reversal mechanisms are
modeled as a function of applied magnetoelectric pressure. The theory is
assessed with reference to latest experimental works on magnetoelectric
switching of thin-film Cr2O3: domain wall propagation is found to be dominant
and responsible for switching in the experiments. The results bear implications
in the energy-delay performance of ME memory devices utilizing
antiferromagnetic insulators, which are prospective for nonvolatile technology.

the typical decorrelatedness and sparsity of E neuron activity. Numerical
simulations of unsupervised learning show that relatively few I neurons can be
sufficient for achieving good decorrelation, and increasing the number of I
neurons makes decorrelation more complete. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to
active E neurons are approximately balanced as a result of learning.

  link to code for computer-assisted portion",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most widely studied convex relaxations in combinatorial
optimization is the relaxation of the cut polytope $\mathscr C^N$ to the
elliptope $\mathscr E^N$, which corresponds to the degree 2 sum-of-squares
(SOS) relaxation of optimizing a quadratic form over the hypercube $\{\pm
1\}^N$. We study the extension of this classical idea to degree 4 SOS, which
gives an intermediate relaxation we call the degree 4 generalized elliptope
$\mathscr E_4^N$. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for
the Gram matrix of a collection of vectors to belong to $\mathscr E_4^N$.
Consequences include a tight rank inequality between degree 2 and degree 4
pseudomoment matrices, and a guarantee that the only extreme points of
$\mathscr E^N$ also in $\mathscr E_4^N$ are the cut matrices; that is,
$\mathscr E^N$ and $\mathscr E_4^N$ share no ""spurious"" extreme point.
  For Gram matrices of equiangular tight frames, we give a simple criterion for
membership in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$. This yields new inequalities satisfied in
$\mathscr{E}_4^N$ but not $\mathscr{E}^N$ whose structure is related to the
Schl\""{a}fli graph and which cannot be obtained as linear combinations of
triangle inequalities. We also give a new proof of the restriction to degree 4
of a result of Laurent showing that $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ does not satisfy certain
cut polytope inequalities capturing parity constraints. Though limited to this
special case, our proof of the positive semidefiniteness of Laurent's
pseudomoment matrix is short and elementary.
  Our techniques also suggest that membership in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ is closely
related to the partial transpose operation on block matrices, which has
previously played an important role in the study of quantum entanglement. To
illustrate, we present a correspondence between certain entangled bipartite
quantum states and the matrices of $\mathscr{E}_4^N\setminus\mathscr{C}^N$.

holes (SMBHs) at their centers. When galaxies merge, their component black
holes form SMBH binaries (SMBHBs), which emit low-frequency gravitational waves
(GWs) that can be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We have searched the
recently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
(NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits.
As we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\% upper
limits on the strength of GWs from such sources as a function of GW frequency
and sky location. We placed a sky-averaged upper limit on the GW strain of $h_0
< 7.3(3) \times 10^{-15}$ at $f_\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz. We also developed a
technique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar
using ``dropout' parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals in
measurements from individual pulsars. We used our upper limits on the GW strain
to place lower limits on the distances to individual SMBHBs. At the
most-sensitive sky location, we ruled out SMBHBs emitting GWs with
$f_\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz within 120 Mpc for $\mathcal{M} = 10^9 \, M_\odot$, and
within 5.5 Gpc for $\mathcal{M} = 10^{10} \, M_\odot$. We also determined that
there are no SMBHBs with $\mathcal{M} > 1.6 \times 10^9 \, M_\odot$ emitting
GWs in the Virgo Cluster. Finally, we estimated the number of potentially
detectable sources given our current strain upper limits based on galaxies in
Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and merger rates from the Illustris
cosmological simulation project. Only 34 out of 75,000 realizations of the
local Universe contained a detectable source, from which we concluded it was
unsurprising that we did not detect any individual sources given our current
sensitivity to GWs.

indexed segment tree forest (ISTF) based solutions for intersection of multiple
genomic interval sets in parallel. We developed these methods as a tool, Joint
Overlap Analysis (JOA), which takes n interval sets and finds overlapping
intervals with no constraints on the given intervals. The proposed indexed
segment tree forest is a novel composite data structure, which leverages on
indexing and natural binning of a segment tree. We also presented construction
and search algorithms for this novel data structure. We compared JOA ST and JOA
ISTF with each other, and with other interval intersection tools for
verification of its correctness and for showing that it attains comparable
execution times. We implemented JOA in Java using the fork/join framework which
speeds up parallel processing by taking advantage of all available processor
cores. We compared JOA ST with JOA ISTF and showed that segment tree and
indexed segment tree forest methods are comparable with each other in terms of
execution time and memory usage. We also carried out execution time comparison
analysis for JOA and other tools and demonstrated that JOA has comparable
execution time and is able to further reduce its running time by using more
processors per node. JOA can be run using its GUI or as a command line tool.

We provide
four constructive answers. First, researchers can measure the extent of
falsification. To do this, we consider continuous relaxations of the baseline
assumptions of concern. We then define the falsification frontier: The smallest
relaxations of the baseline model which are not refuted. This frontier provides
a quantitative measure of the extent of falsification. Second, researchers can
present the identified set for the parameter of interest under the assumption
that the true model lies somewhere on this frontier. We call this the
falsification adaptive set. This set generalizes the standard baseline estimand
to account for possible falsification. Third, researchers can present the
identified set for a specific point on this frontier. Finally, as a sensitivity
analysis, researchers can present identified sets for points beyond the
frontier. To illustrate these four ways of salvaging falsified models, we study
overidentifying restrictions in two instrumental variable models: a homogeneous
effects linear model, and heterogeneous effect models with either binary or
continuous outcomes. In the linear model, we consider the classical
overidentifying restrictions implied when multiple instruments are observed. We
generalize these conditions by considering continuous relaxations of the
classical exclusion restrictions. By sufficiently weakening the assumptions, a
falsified baseline model becomes non-falsified. We obtain analogous results in
the heterogeneous effect models, where we derive identified sets for marginal
distributions of potential outcomes, falsification frontiers, and falsification
adaptive sets under continuous relaxations of the instrument exogeneity
assumptions. We illustrate our results in four different empirical
applications.

decisions that distribute computational resources across several simulation
models become extremely important in situations where only a small number of
expensive high fidelity simulations can be run. We identify this allocation
decision as a problem in optimal subset selection, and subsequently regularize
this problem so that solutions can be computed. Our regularized formulation
yields a type of group lasso problem that has been studied in the literature to
accomplish subset selection. Our numerical results compare performance of
algorithms that solve the group lasso problem for algorithmic allocation
against a variety of other strategies, including those based on classical
linear algebraic pivoting routines and those derived from more modern machine
learning-based methods. We demonstrate on well known synthetic problems and
more difficult real-world simulations that this group lasso solution to the
relaxed optimal subset selection problem performs better than the alternatives.

implemented using IBM's superconductivity-based quantum computers which are

improve the possibility of observing unique features of quantum mechanics.
Specifically, a systematic procedure is used here to obtain optimized circuits
(circuits having reduced gate count and number of levels) for a large number of
Clifford+T circuits which have already been implemented in the IBM quantum
computers. Optimized circuits implementable in IBM quantum computers are also
obtained for a set of reversible benchmark circuits. With a clear example, it
is shown that the reduction in circuit costs enhances the fidelity of the
output state (with respect to the theoretically expected state in the absence
of noise) as lesser number of gates and levels introduce lesser amount of
errors during evolution of the state. Further, considering Mermin inequality as
an example, it's shown that the violation of classical limit is enhanced when
we use an optimized circuit. Thus, the approach adopted here can be used to
identify relatively weaker signature of quantumness and also to establish
quantum supremacy in a stronger manner.

the final products in the water are photons in the UV-to-visible range of the

4 PMTs and (iii) a third volume covering the top of both, also equipped with

the resulting configuration oscillates under this mode with amplitude that
depends on the mass ratio and head-on momentum. In some cases the resulting
configuration oscillates with changes in density of two orders of magnitude and
with a matter distribution that is far from isotropic. These results could
contribute to the collection of possible mass distributions considered in the

incoherent light sources and large dynamic-range wavefront measurements. We
compare the precision of a DWS to a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWS) when
using coherent, partially coherent, and incoherent illumination, in the
application of autorefraction. We induce spherical and cylindrical errors in a
model eye and use a multi-level Demon's non-rigid registration algorithm to
estimate caustic displacements relative to an emmetropic model eye. When
compared to spherical error measurements with the SHWS using partially coherent
illumination, the DWS demonstrates a $\sim$5-fold improvement in dynamic range
(-4.0 to +4.5 D vs. -22.0 to +19.5 D) with less than half the reduction in
resolution (0.072 vs. 0.116 D), enabling a $\sim$3-fold increase in the number
of resolvable prescriptions (118 vs. 358). In addition to being 40x lower-cost,
the unique, non-periodic nature of the caustic pattern formed by a diffuser
enables a larger dynamic range of aberration measurements compared to a lenslet
array.

Ring of electron-cloud-induced betatron tune shifts for trains of positron
bunches at 2.1 and 5.3 GeV with bunch populations ranging between 0.64x10^10
and 9.6x10^10. Measurements using a witness bunch with variable distance from
the end of the train and variable bunch population provide information on cloud
decay and cloud pinching during the bunch passage. We employ Monte Carlo
simulations of the reflection and absorption of synchrotron radiation photons
to determine the pattern of absorption sites around the circumference of the
storage ring. The Geant4 simulation toolkit is used to model the interactions
of the photons with the beampipe wall and determine the production energy and
location distributions of the photoelectrons which seed the electron cloud. An
electron cloud buildup model based on fitted ring-averaged secondary-yield
properties of the vacuum chamber predicts tune shifts in good agreement with
the measurements.

from the development of our tool and method: (1) identifying coders' certainty
constitutes an important part of determining the quality of data analysis and
facilitates identifying overlapping and ambiguous codes, (2) making the details
of coding process visible helps streamline the coding process and leads to a

time t to t + dt is governed by a regularized anisotropic elasticity model.
More precisely, we assume that at each time shapes are infinitesimally deformed
from a stress-free state to an elastic equilibrium as a result of the
application of a small force. The configuration of equilibrium then becomes the
new resting state for subsequent evolution. The primary motivation of this work
is the modeling of slow changes in biological shapes like atrophy, where a body
force applied to the volume represents the location and impact of the disease.
Our model uses an optimal control viewpoint with the time derivative of force
interpreted as a control, deforming a shape gradually from its observed initial
state to an observed final state. Furthermore, inspired by the layered
organization of cortical volumes, we consider a special case of our model in
which shapes can be decomposed into a family of layers (forming a ""foliation"").
Preliminary experiments on synthetic layered shapes in two and three dimensions
are presented to demonstrate the effect of elasticity.

can be transformed into a real-valued 'Bloch vector'. The Lindbladian, a

can, e.g., implement a high-performance parallel simplex algorithm to find a

dissipative operators is independent of $N$, which is often the case for
physically meaningful models. Here we present an algorithm to transform quantum

re-write it at will has ushered in a stunning period in the history of science.
Nonetheless, there is an Achilles heel exposed by all of the genomic data that
has accrued: we still don't know how to interpret it. Many genes are subject to
sophisticated programs of transcriptional regulation, mediated by DNA sequences
that harbor binding sites for transcription factors which can up- or
down-regulate gene expression depending upon environmental conditions. This
gives rise to an input-output function describing how the level of expression
depends upon the parameters of the regulated gene { for instance, on the number
and type of binding sites in its regulatory sequence. In recent years, the
ability to make precision measurements of expression, coupled with the ability
to make increasingly sophisticated theoretical predictions, have enabled an
explicit dialogue between theory and experiment that holds the promise of
covering this genomic Achilles heel. The goal is to reach a predictive
understanding of transcriptional regulation that makes it possible to calculate
gene expression levels from DNA regulatory sequence. This review focuses on the
canonical simple repression motif to ask how well the models that have been
used to characterize it actually work. We consider a hierarchy of increasingly
sophisticated experiments in which the minimal parameter set learned at one
level is applied to make quantitative predictions at the next. We show that
these careful quantitative dissections provide a template for a predictive

the tradeoffs of distributing the budget over few or many starting points, with
the former getting more budget per point and latter less.

consists of densities with polyhedral support whose logarithms are piecewise

sum $\Gamma(f)$ of the numbers of facets of the subdomains in the polyhedral
subdivision of the support induced by $f$. Given $n$ independent observations
from a $d$-dimensional log-concave density with $d \in \{2,3\}$, we prove a
sharp oracle inequality, which in particular implies that the Kullback--Leibler
risk of the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator for such densities is
bounded above by $\Gamma(f)/n$, up to a polylogarithmic factor. Thus, the rate
can be essentially parametric, even in this multivariate setting. For the
second type of adaptation, we consider densities that are bounded away from
zero on a polytopal support; we show that up to polylogarithmic factors, the
log-concave maximum likelihood estimator attains the rate $n^{-4/7}$ when
$d=3$, which is faster than the worst-case rate of $n^{-1/2}$. Finally, our
third type of subclass consists of densities whose contours are well-separated;

  conference `The Physical Universe', Nagpur, March 2018",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The black hole information paradox is resolved in string theory by a radical
change in the picture of the hole: black hole microstates are horizon sized
quantum gravity objects called `fuzzballs' instead of vacuum regions with a
central singularity. The requirement of causality implies that the quantum
gravity wavefunctional $\Psi$ has an important component not present in the
semiclassical picture: virtual fuzzballs. The large mass $M$ of the fuzzballs
would suppress their virtual fluctuations, but this suppression is compensated
by the large number -- $Exp[S_{bek}(M)]$ -- of possible fuzzballs. These
fuzzballs are extended compression-resistant objects. The presence of these
objects in the vacuum wavefunctional alters the physics of collapse when a
horizon is about to form; this resolves the information paradox. We argue that
these virtual fuzzballs also resist the curving of spacetime, and so cancel out
the large cosmological constant created by the vacuum energy of local quantum
fields. Assuming that the Birkoff theorem holds to leading order, we can map
the black hole information problem to a problem in cosmology. Using the virtual
fuzzball component of the wavefunctional, we give a qualitative picture of the
evolution of $\Psi$ which is consistent with the requirements placed by the
information paradox.

computationally expensive given that charge carriers migrate in interaction
with intra- and inter-molecular atomic motion. Screening sequences, e.g. to
identify excellent electrical conductors is challenging even when adopting
coarse-grained models and effective computational schemes that do not
explicitly describe atomic dynamics. In this work, we present a machine
learning (ML) model that allows the inexpensive prediction of the electrical
conductance of millions of {\it long} double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences,
reducing computational costs by orders of magnitude. The algorithm is trained
on {\it short} DNA nanojunctions with $n=3-7$ base pairs. The electrical
conductance of the training set is computed with a quantum scattering method,
which captures charge-nuclei scattering processes. We demonstrate that the ML
method accurately predicts the electrical conductance of varied dsDNA junctions
tracing different transport mechanisms: coherent (short-range) quantum
tunneling, on-resonance (ballistic) transport, and incoherent site-to-site
hopping. Furthermore, the ML approach supports physical observations that
clusters of nucleotides regulate DNA transport behavior. The input features
tested in this work could be used in other ML studies of charge transport in
complex polymers, in the search for promising electronic and thermoelectric
materials.

of a 1D critical ground state---which has long range entanglement---can be
viewed as a strange correlator: the overlap of a 2D state with short range
entanglement and a 2D product state. Strange correlators were recently
introduced to map 2D symmetry protected or topologically ordered quantum states
to critical systems in one lower dimension. The 2D quantum state dual to the
input 1D critical state is obtained by lifting the MERA, a procedure which
introduces bulk quantum degrees of freedom by inserting intertwiner tensors on
each bond of the MERA tensor network. We show how this dual 2D bulk state
exhibits several features of holography, for example, appearance of
horizon-like holographic screens and bulk gauging of global on-site symmetries
at the boundary. We also derive a quantum corrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula
relating boundary entanglement entropy to bulk geodesic lengths---as measured
by bulk entropy---and numerically test it for ground states of a set of unitary

synchronization) is a central problem across computer vision and many other
relevant fields. Compared to optimizing pairwise maps in isolation, the benefit
of map synchronization is that there are natural constraints among a map
network that can improve the quality of individual maps. While such
self-supervision constraints are well-understood for undirected map networks
(e.g., the cycle-consistency constraint), they are under-explored for directed
map networks, which naturally arise when maps are given by parametric maps
(e.g., a feed-forward neural network). In this paper, we study a natural
self-supervision constraint for directed map networks called path-invariance,
which enforces that composite maps along different paths between a fixed pair
of source and target domains are identical. We introduce path-invariance bases
for efficient encoding of the path-invariance constraint and present an
algorithm that outputs a path-variance basis with polynomial time and space
complexities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on optimizing
object correspondences, estimating dense image maps via neural networks, and
semantic segmentation of 3D scenes via map networks of diverse 3D
representations. In particular, for 3D semantic segmentation, our approach only
requires 8% labeled data from ScanNet to achieve the same performance as
training a single 3D segmentation network with 30% to 100% labeled data.

short) problems where the systems governed by forward-backward stochastic
differential equations (FBSDEs for short), in which the control has two
components: the regular control, and the singular one. Both drift and diffusion
terms may involve the regular control variable. The regular control domain is
postulated to be convex. Under certain assumptions, in the framework of the
Malliavin calculus, we derive the pointwise second-order necessary conditions
for stochastic SOC in the classical sense. This condition is described by two
adjoint processes, a maximum condition on the Hamiltonian supported by an
illustrative example. A new necessary condition for optimal singular control is
obtained as well. Besides, as a by-product, a verification theorem for SOCs is
derived via viscosity solutions without involving any derivatives of the value
functions. It is worth pointing out that this theorem has wider applicability
than the restrictive classical verification theorems. Finally, we focus on the
connection between the maximum principle and the dynamic programming principle
for such SOCs problem without the assumption that the value function is smooth
enough.

endeavor due to their low gravity. The risk is so high that missions such as
Hayabusa II and OSIRIS-REx will be performing touch and go missions to obtain
samples. The next logical step is to perform longer-term mobility on the
surface of these asteroid. This can be accomplished by sending small landers of
a 1 kg or less with miniature propulsion systems that can just offset the force
of asteroid gravity. Such a propulsion system would ideally be used to hop on
the surface of the asteroid. Hopping has been found to be most efficient form
of mobility on low-gravity. Use of wheels for rolling presents substantial
challenges as the wheel can't gain traction to roll. The Asteroid Mobile Imager
and Geologic Observer (AMIGO) utilizes 1 kg landers that are stowed in a 1U
CubeSat configuration and deployed, releasing an inflatable that is 1 m in
diameter. The inflatable is attached to the top of the 1U lander, enabling high
speed communications and a means of easily tracking lander from an overhead
mothership. Milligravity propulsion is required for the AMIGO landers to
perform ballistic hops on the asteroid surface. The propulsion system is used
to navigate the lander across the surface of the asteroid under the extremely
low gravity while taking care to not exceed escape velocity.Although the
concept for AMIGO missions is to use multiple landers, the more surface area
evaluated by each lander the better. Without a propulsion system, each AMIGO
will have a limited range of observable area. The propulsion system also serves
as a rough attitude control system (ACS), as it enables pointing and regulation
over where the lander is positioned via an array of MEMS thrusters.

  Towards this goal we are putting forth plans for a 12U CubeSat that will be

this paper, we will present an overview of the systems engineering and
instrumentation design on the spacecraft. Parts of this 12U CubeSat will

silicon-based PICs for quantum photonic information processing (or the
so-called silicon quantum photonics) provides a promising pathway for
large-scale quantum applications. For the development of scalable silicon
quantum PICs, a major challenge is integrating on-silicon quantum light sources
that deterministically emit single photons. In this regard, the use of
epitaxial InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) is a very promising approach, because of
their capability of deterministic single-photon emission with high purity and
indistinguishability. However, the required hybrid integration is inherently
difficult and often lacks the compatibility with CMOS processes. Here, we
demonstrate a QD single-photon source (SPS) integrated on a glass-clad silicon
photonic waveguide processed by a CMOS foundry. Hybrid integration is performed
using transfer printing, which enables us to integrate heterogeneous optical
components in a simple pick-and-place manner and thus assemble them after the
entire CMOS process is completed. We observe single-photon emission from the
integrated QD and its efficient coupling into the silicon waveguide. Our
transfer-printing-based approach is fully compatible with CMOS back-end
processes, and thus will open the possibility for realizing large-scale quantum
PICs that leverage CMOS technology.

tree-based matching algorithm to construct image-like feature maps from
high-fidelity meteorological datasets - wind, temperature and convective
weather. We then model the track points on trajectories as conditional Gaussian
mixtures with parameters to be learned from our proposed deep generative model,
which is an end-to-end convolutional recurrent neural network that consists of
a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder network and a mixture density LSTM
decoder network. The encoder network embeds last-filed flight plan information
into fixed-size hidden state variables and feeds the decoder network, which
further learns the spatiotemporal correlations from the historical flight
tracks and outputs the parameters of Gaussian mixtures. Convolutional layers
are integrated into the pipeline to learn representations from the
high-dimension weather features. During the inference process, beam search,
adaptive Kalman filter, and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother algorithms are used to
prune the variance of generated trajectories.

  In this paper, Based on the experimental results that the stereo matching

unsupervised depth estimation model, we proposed an unsupervised monocular
vision stereo matching method. In order to achieve the monocular stereo

was to reconstruct the right view from the left view, and the other was to
estimate the depth map using the reconstructed right view and the original left

first FBOT discovered in real time, is consistent with the magnetar scenario

sources and assess their broader implications. Using AT2018cow as a prototype,
we investigate high-energy neutrino and cosmic ray production from FBOTs and
the more general class of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). By calculating the
interaction of cosmic rays and the time-evolving radiation field and baryon

the ejecta at ultrahigh energies (UHE). The predicted high-energy neutrino
fluence from AT2018cow is below the sensitivity of the IceCube Observatory, and
estimates of the cosmically-integrated neutrino flux from FBOTs are consistent
with the extreme-high-energy upper limits posed by IceCube. High-energy
$\gamma$ rays exceeding GeV energies are obscured for the first months to years
by thermal photons in the magnetar nebula, but are potentially observable at
later times. Given also their potentially higher volumetric rate compared to

that FBOTs are favorable targets for current and next-generation

Consequently, Soft-AE can be naturally interpreted as a learned cascaded

  We begin with a set $S$ of 56 distinct translates of a certain function $M$,
which takes the form of a Barnes integral, and is expressible as a sum of two
very-well-poised $_9F_8$ hypergeometric series of unit argument. We consider a
known, transitive action of the Coxeter group $W(E_7)$ on this set. We show
that, by removing from $W(E_7)$ a particular generator, we obtain a subgroup
that is isomorphic to $W(D_6)$, and that acts intransitively on $S$,
partitioning it into three orbits, of sizes 32, 12, and 12 respectively.
  Taking certain limits of the $M$ functions in the first orbit yields a set of
32 $J$ functions, each of which is a sum of two Saalsch\""utzian $_4F_3$

  In a similar way, the image of each of the size-12 orbits, under a similar

earlier works. In fact, these two image sets are the same.
  The limiting process is seen to preserve distance, except on pairs consisting

networks (DNNs), two important categories of DNN model compression techniques:
weight pruning and weight quantization are investigated. The former leverages
the redundancy in the number of weights, whereas the latter leverages the
redundancy in bit representation of weights. However, there lacks a systematic
framework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs, thereby limiting
the available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction,
energy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be
accounted for besides simply model size reduction.
  To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first
algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to deal with
non-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The
first part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning
and quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization
technique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM
iteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than
prior work. The second part is hardware-aware DNN optimizations to facilitate
hardware-level implementations.
  Without accuracy loss, we can achieve 85$\times$ and 24$\times$ pruning on
LeNet-5 and AlexNet models, respectively, significantly higher than prior work.
The improvement becomes more significant when focusing on computation
reductions. Combining weight pruning and quantization, we achieve 1,910$\times$
and 231$\times$ reductions in overall model size on these two benchmarks, when
focusing on data storage. Highly promising results are also observed on other
representative DNNs such as VGGNet and ResNet-50.

between releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire

analytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the
average neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the
concentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is
independent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first
term is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural
firing correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The
second term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order.
Interestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild
assumptions. We verify our asymptotic results by high-order numerical

transforms $T_{n,a}(s+\Sigma)$, with each coordinate of $\Sigma$ being a
non-negative integer.
  We then focus on the case $n=4$. In this case, we use the relation referenced
above to derive further relations, each of which involves ""strictly positive
shifts"" in one of the coordinates of $s$. More specifically: each of our new
relations expresses $T_{4,a}(s)$ in terms of $T_{4,a}(s+\Sigma)$ and
$T_{4,a}(s+\Omega)$, where for some $1\le k\le 3$, the $k$th coordinates of

paper proposes a general method for taking this dependence into account, based
on the decomposition of the incident field into the angular spectrum of plane
waves, which are the FPI eigenfunctions. In the scalar approximation, the
angular-frequency transfer function and the point-spread function (Green
function) of the FPI are calculated, which enables to relate the spatial
coherence functions of the incident and transmitted radiation and to derive an
expression for the output intensity I(r, k) and for the integral transmittance
P(k) depending on the wavenumber of the incident monochromatic radiation k. In
the resulting expressions, I(r, k) is completely determined by the Fourier
transform of the input coherence function, and P(k) is determined by the
angular power spectrum (APS) of the incident radiation. For beams of small
divergence and high-quality FPIs, simplified formulas have been obtained that
allow, in the first approximation, for the dependence of the FPI parameters on
the angle of incidence and on the radiation wavelength. Analysis of the
expressions obtained makes it possible to clarify an exact meaning of the
well-known regularities in the distortions of the FPI transmission band
associated with the incident beam deviation from the plane wave (shift to the
shortwave region, broadening, reduction of the maximum transmittance and the
appearance of asymmetry). As examples, calculations of the integral
transmittance for three types of APS, corresponding to Gaussian and conical
beams, and the output intensity distribution I(r, k) for the input beam with a
Gaussian APS are performed. Results are consistent with other theoretical and

Due to positive magnetostriction constants, compressive in-plane strain induces
a PMA field as large as 32.9 kOe for 4 nm thick EuIG and 66.7 kOe for 5 nm

increases. In bilayers consisting of Pt and EuIG or Pt and TbIG, robust PMA is
revealed by squared anomalous Hall hysteresis loops in Pt, the magnitude of

sublattices. Furthermore, the magnetostriction constant is found to be
2.7x10^(-5) for EuIG and 1.35x10^(-5) for TbIG, comparable with the values for

including data mining, machine learning, statistics and many applied domains.
Inspired by the success of ensemble methods and the flexibility of tree-based
methodology, we propose random projection forests (rpForests), for kNN search.
rpForests finds kNNs by aggregating results from an ensemble of random
projection trees with each constructed recursively through a series of
carefully chosen random projections. rpForests achieves a remarkable accuracy
in terms of fast decay in the missing rate of kNNs and that of discrepancy in
the kNN distances. rpForests has a very low computational complexity. The
ensemble nature of rpForests makes it easily run in parallel on multicore or
clustered computers; the running time is expected to be nearly inversely
proportional to the number of cores or machines. We give theoretical insights
by showing the exponential decay of the probability that neighboring points
would be separated by ensemble random projection trees when the ensemble size
increases. Our theory can be used to refine the choice of random projections in
the growth of trees, and experiments show that the effect is remarkable.

using spectral synthesis code SYNAPPS. We confirm detections of helium emission
in the early-time spectra of two SNe Iax: SNe 2004cs and 2007J. These He I
features are better fit by a pure-emission Gaussian than by a P-Cygni profile,
indicating that the helium emission originates from the circumstellar
environment rather than the SN ejecta. Based on the modeling of the remaining
42 SNe Iax, we find no obvious helium features in other SN Iax spectra.
However, $\approx 76\%$ of our sample lack sufficiently deep luminosity limits
to detect helium emission with a luminosity of that seen in SNe 2004cs and
2007J. Using the objects with constraining luminosity limits, we calculate that
33% of SNe Iax have detectable helium in their spectra. We examine 11 SNe Iax
with late-time spectra and find no hydrogen or helium emission from swept up
material. For late-time spectra, we calculate typical upper limits of stripped
hydrogen and helium to be $2 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $10^{-2}$
M$_{\odot}$, respectively. While detections of helium in SNe Iax support a
white dwarf-He star binary progenitor system (i.e., a single-degenerate [SD]
channel), non-detections may be explained by variations in the explosion and
ejecta material. The lack of helium in the majority of our sample demonstrates
the complexity of SN Iax progenitor systems and the need for further modeling.
With strong independent evidence indicating that SNe Iax arise from a SD
channel, we caution the common interpretation that the lack of helium or
hydrogen emission at late-time in SN Ia spectra rules out SD progenitor
scenarios for this class.

the classical Maxwell model and two generalisations of it obtained from
effective medium theory and differential effective medium theory) so that the
resulting effective thermal conductivity accounts for radiative heat transfer
within gas voids. In the high-temperature regime, radiative transfer within
voids strongly influences the thermal conductivity of the bulk material.
Indeed, the utility of these models over classical Maxwell-type models is seen
in the high-temperature regime, where they predict that the effective thermal
conductivity of the composite material levels off to a constant value (as a
function of temperature) at very high temperatures, provided that the material
is not too porous, in agreement with experiments. This behaviour is in contrast
to models which neglect radiative transfer within the pores, or lumped
parameter models, as such models do not resolve the radiative transfer
independently from other physical phenomena. Our results may be of particular
use for industrial and scientific applications involving heat transfer within
porous composite materials taking place in the high-temperature regime.

accessing and consuming the useful candidate papers, in very large digital

Unfortunately, because of language barrier, some scientists (especially the
junior ones or graduate students who do not master other languages) cannot
efficiently locate the publications hosted in a foreign language repository. In
this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation
via Hierarchical Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Graph (HRLHG), to
address this new problem. HRLHG can learn a representation function by mapping
the publications, from multilingual repositories, to a low-dimensional joint
embedding space from various kinds of vertexes and relations on a heterogeneous
graph. By leveraging both global (task specific) plus local (task independent)
information as well as a novel supervised hierarchical random walk algorithm,
the proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing
the likelihood of locating the important cross-language neighborhoods on the
graph. Experiment results show that the proposed method can not only outperform
state-of-the-art baseline models, but also improve the interpretability of the
representation model for cross-language citation recommendation task.

model voting situations where a number of agents (players) vote against or for
a proposal. In such games, a proposal is accepted if an appropriately weighted
sum of the votes exceeds a prespecified threshold. As the influence of a player
over the voting outcome is not in general proportional to her assigned weight,
various power indices have been proposed to measure each player's influence.
The inverse power index problem is the problem of designing a weighted voting
game that achieves a set of target influences according to a predefined power
index. In this work, we study the computational complexity of the inverse
problem when the power index belongs to the class of semivalues. We prove that
the inverse problem is computationally intractable for a broad family of
semivalues, including all regular semivalues. As a special case of our general
result, we establish computational hardness of the inverse problem for the
Banzhaf indices and the Shapley values, arguably the most popular power

([11,43]), a pure energy argument (independent of the spectral analysis) has
been developed in more general $L^p$ critical framework, which allows to remove
the smallness of low frequencies of initial data. Indeed, bounding the

modelers to coordinate. Coordination is easier if results are expressed in
terms of well-defined parameters. Key parameters include the following
quantitative geologic constraints. (1) Cumulative post-3.4 Ga
precipitation-sourced water runoff in some places exceeded 1 km column. (2)
There is no single Early Mars climate problem: the traces of $\ge$2
river-forming periods are seen. Relative to rivers that formed earlier in Mars
history, rivers that formed later in Mars history are found preferentially at
lower elevations, and show a stronger dependence on latitude. (3) The duration
of the longest individual river-forming climate was >(10$^2$-10$^3$) yr, based
on paleolake hydrology. (4) Peak runoff production was >0.1 mm/hr. However, (5)
peak runoff production was intermittent, sustained (in a given catchment) for
only <10% of the duration of river-forming climates. (6) The cumulative number
of wet years during the valley-network-forming period was >10$^5$ yr. (7)
Post-Noachian light-toned, layered sedimentary rocks took >10$^7$ yr to
accumulate. However, (8) an ""average"" place on Mars saw water for <10$^7$ yr
after the Noachian, suggesting that the river-forming climates were
interspersed with long globally-dry intervals. (9) Geologic proxies for Early
Mars atmospheric pressure indicate pressure was not less than 0.012 bar but not
much more than 1 bar. A truth table of these geologic constraints versus

$\bar{P}(t) \in \mathbb{F}_{q}[t]$, we initiate the investigation of the

randomly chosen with respect to the Haar probability measure on the additive
group $\mathrm{Mat}_{n}(R)$ of $n \times n$ $R$-matrices. One of our main
results generalizes two results of Friedman and Washington. Our other results
are related to the distribution of the $\bar{P}$-part of a random matrix
$\bar{A} \in \mathrm{Mat}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ with respect to the uniform
distribution, and one of them generalizes a result of Fulman. We heuristically
relate our results to a celebrated conjecture of Cohen and Lenstra, which
predicts that given an odd prime $p$, any finite abelian $p$-group (i.e.,
$\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-module) $H$ occurs as the $p$-part of the class group of a
random imaginary quadratic field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ with a probability
inversely proportional to $|\mathrm{Aut}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H)|$. We review three
different heuristics for the conjecture of Cohen and Lenstra, and they are all
related to special cases of our main conjecture, which we prove as our main
theorems. For proofs, we use some concrete combinatorial connections between
$\mathrm{Mat}_{n}(R)$ and $\mathrm{Mat}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ to translate our
problems about a Haar-random matrix in $\mathrm{Mat}_{n}(R)$ into problems
about a random matrix in $\mathrm{Mat}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ with respect to the

of strange quark matter (SQM) whose distribution is governed by the
phenomenological MIT bag EOS as $p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B)$, where $B$ is the bag
constant, while the form of charge distribution is chosen to be
$q\left(r\right)=Q\left(r/R\right)^3=\alpha r^3$ with $\alpha$ as a constant.
We derive the values of the unknown parameters by matching the interior
spacetime to the exterior Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m metric followed by the
appropriate choice of the values of the parameters $\chi$ and $\alpha$. Our
study reveals that besides SQM, a new kind of matter distribution originates
due to the interaction between the matter and the extra geometric term, while
the modification of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation invokes the
presence of a new force $F_c$. The accumulation of the electric charge
distribution reaches its maximum at the surface, and the predicted values of
the corresponding electric charge and electric field are of the order of
$10^{19-20}$ C and $10^{21-22}$ V/cm, respectively. To examine the physical
validity of our solutions, we perform several tests and find that the proposed
$f(R, \mathcal{T})$ model survives all these critical tests. Therefore, our
model can describe the non-singular charged strange stars and justify the
supermassive compact stellar objects having their masses beyond the maximum
mass limit for the compact stars in the standard scenario. Our model also
supports the existence of several exotic astrophysical objects like

associated with a family of complex curves with cusps, which admit singular
fibers.
  More precisely, we fix a family of complex curves $\pi : X \to S$, which
admit at most double-point singularities. Let $(\xi, h^{\xi})$ be a holomorphic
Hermitian vector bundle over $X$. Let $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_m : S \to X$ be
disjoint holomorphic sections. We denote the divisor $D_{X/S} :=
\rm{Im}(\sigma_1) + \cdots + \rm{Im}(\sigma_m)$, and endow the relative
canonical line bundle $\omega_{X/S}$ with a Hermitian norm such that its
restriction at each fiber of $\pi$ induces K\""ahler metric with hyperbolic
cusps. This Hermitian norm induces the Hermitian norm on the twisted relative
canonical line bundle $\omega_{X/S}(D) := \omega_{X/S} \otimes
\mathscr{O}_{X}(D_{X/S})$.
  For $n \leq 0$, we study the determinant line bundle $\lambda(j^*(\xi \otimes
\omega_{X/S}(D)^n))$. We endow it with the Quillen norm by using the analytic
torsion from the first paper of this series. Then we study the regularity of
this Quillen norm and its asymptotics near the locus of singular curves. The
singular terms of the asymptotics turn out to be reasonable enough, so that the
curvature of $\lambda(j^*(\xi \otimes \omega_{X/S}(D)^n))$ is well-defined as a
current over $S$. We derive the explicit formula for this current, which gives
a refinement of Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem at the level of currents.
This generalizes the curvature formulas of Takhtajan-Zograf and Bismut-Bost.
  As a consequence of our study, we also get some regularity results on the
Weil-Petersson form over the moduli space of pointed curves, which are enough
to conclude the well-known fact, originally due to Wolpert, that the
Weil-Petersson volume of the moduli space of pointed stable curves is a
rational multiple of a power of $\pi$.

comparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the
classic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains
cannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees
transaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that
randomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical
evaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without

high-stake applications with intelligent devices such as drones and smart
vehicles make the cloud computing inapplicable in these scenarios. Instead,
edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training
and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized
data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for
training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth
limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and
address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different
devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model
aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each
selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main
bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a
novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation
via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel.
This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is
modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient
algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a
difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank
function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in
the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve
the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic
advantages and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies are
demonstrated through extensive numerical results.

Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with
the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species
with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding
connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve
more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting
where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal
size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows
how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more
learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to
generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster
and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size,
the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning
performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the
need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some
neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our
analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental
relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and
intrinsic noise in neural circuits.

numerous physical, biological, and materials systems but also finds
applications in mathematics and in analysis of geophysical and meteorological
measurements. In contrast to particle distributions in Euclidean space,
restriction that the particles should lie on the sphere brings about several
important constraints. These require a careful extension of quantities used for
particle distributions in Euclidean space to those confined to the sphere. We
introduce a framework designed to analyze and classify structural (dis)order in
particle distributions constrained to the sphere. The classification is based
on the concept of hyperuniformity, which was introduced 15 years ago and since
then studied extensively in Euclidean space, yet has only very recently been
considered for the sphere. We build our framework on a generalization of the
structure factor on the sphere, which we relate to the power spectrum of the
corresponding multipole expansion. The spherical structure factor is then shown
to couple with cap number variance, a measure of local density fluctuations,
allowing us to derive different forms of the variance. In this way, we
construct a classification of hyperuniformity for scale-free particle
distributions on the sphere and show how it can be extended to other
distributions as well. We demonstrate that hyperuniformity on the sphere can be
defined either through a vanishing spherical structure factor at low multipole
numbers or through a scaling of the cap number variance, in both cases
extending the Euclidean definition while pointing out crucial differences. Our
work provides a comprehensive tool for detecting long-range order on spheres
and the analysis of spherical computational meshes, biological and synthetic
spherical assemblies, and ordering phase transitions in spherically-distributed

contain zeroth-order, first-order as well as reentrant phase transitions (RPTs)
depending on the value of the coupling constant $\alpha$ between the
electromagnetic field and the dilaton. We try to give a microscopic explanation
for these phase transitions by adopting Ruppeiner's approach. By studying the
behaviors of the Ruppeiner invariant $R$ along the co-existing lines, we find
that the various phase transitions may be qualitatively well explained as a
result of two competing factors: the first one is the low-temperature effect
which tends to shrink the BH and the second one is the repulsive interaction
between the BH molecules which, on the contrary, tends to expand the BH. In the
standard phase transition without RPT, as temperature is lowered, the first
kind of factor dominates over the second one, so that large black hole (LBH)
tends to shrink and thus transits to small black hole (SBH); While in the RPT,
after the LBH-SBH transition, as temperature is further decreased, the strength
of the second factor increases quickly and finally becomes strong enough to
dominate over the first factor, so that SBH tends to expand to release the high
repulsion and thus transits back to LBH. Moreover, by comparing the behavior of
$R$ versus the temperature $T$ with fixed pressure to that of ordinary
two-dimensional thermodynamical systems but with fixed specific volume, it is
interesting to see that SBH behaves like a Fermionic gas system in cases with
RPT, while it behaves oppositely to an anyon system in cases without RPT. And
in all cases, LBH behaves like a nearly ideal gas system.

continuum by an anti-bound state located at the mass of the three-quark
threshold. The quark and baryon interactions are accounted for by the coupling
to scalar and vector meson mean fields modelled by density functionals. At
increasing density and temperature, due to the different medium-dependence of
quark and baryon masses, the Mott dissociation of baryons occurs and the
nuclear cluster contributions to the thermodynamics vanish. It is demonstrated
on this simple example that this unified approach to quark-nuclear matter is
capable of describing crossover as well as first order phase transition
behaviour in the phase diagram with a critical endpoint. Changing the meson
mean field, the case of a ""crossover all over"" in the phase diagram is also
obtained.

carriers in spintronics. However, the skyrmion Hall effect due to the
nontrivial topology of skyrmions can induce a skyrmion accumulation or even
annihilation at the edge of the devices, which hinders the real-world
applications of skyrmions. In this work, we theoretically investigate the
current-driven skyrmion motion on magnetic nanotubes which can be regarded as
""edgeless"" in the tangential direction. By performing micromagnetic
simulations, we find that the skyrmion motion exhibits a helical trajectory on
the nanotube, with its axial propagation velocity proportional to the current
density. Interestingly, the skyrmion's annular speed increases with the
increase of the thickness of the nanotube. A simple explanation is presented.
Since the tube is edgeless for the tangential skyrmion motion, a stable
skyrmion propagation can survive in the presence of a very large current
density without any annihilation or accumulation. Our results provide a new
route to overcome the edge effect in planar geometries.

an additional pinning potential. The pinning potential is expected to destroy
the integrability of the system and an interesting question is to see the
signatures of this breaking of integrability on energy transport. We
investigate this by a study of the non-equilibrium steady state of the system
connected to heat baths as well as the study of equilibrium correlations.
Typical signatures of integrable systems are a size-independent energy current,
a flat bulk temperature profile and ballistic scaling of equilibrium dynamical
correlations, these results being valid in the thermodynamic limit. We find
that, as expected, these properties change drastically on introducing the
pinning potential in the Toda model. In particular, we find that the effect of
a harmonic pinning potential is drastically smaller at low temperatures,
compared to a quartic pinning potential. We explain this by noting that at low
temperatures the Toda potential can be approximated by a harmonic
inter-particle potential for which the addition of harmonic pinning does not
destroy integrability.

well-known range queries problem and has a rich variety of applications in such
areas as graph algorithms, functional programming, circuit complexity, and
others. It is easy to compute $Ax$ using $O(u)$ semigroup operations. The main
question studied in this paper is: can $Ax$ be computed using $O(z)$ semigroup
operations? We prove that in general this is not possible: there exists a

$z=2n$) whose complexity is $\Theta(n\alpha(n))$ where $\alpha(n)$ is the

implies that in commutative settings, complements of sparse matrices can be

image under severe occlusion or truncation. Many recent works have shown that a
two-stage approach, which first detects keypoints and then solves a
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose estimation, achieves remarkable
performance. However, most of these methods only localize a set of sparse
keypoints by regressing their image coordinates or heatmaps, which are
sensitive to occlusion and truncation. Instead, we introduce a Pixel-wise
Voting Network (PVNet) to regress pixel-wise unit vectors pointing to the
keypoints and use these vectors to vote for keypoint locations using RANSAC.
This creates a flexible representation for localizing occluded or truncated
keypoints. Another important feature of this representation is that it provides
uncertainties of keypoint locations that can be further leveraged by the PnP
solver. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state of
the art on the LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets by a large
margin, while being efficient for real-time pose estimation. We further create
a Truncation LINEMOD dataset to validate the robustness of our approach against
truncation. The code will be avaliable at https://zju-3dv.github.io/pvnet/.

These SDPs are extremely pathological, often unsolvable, and also serve as
models of more general pathological convex programs. However, despite their
allure, they are not well understood even when they have just two variables.
  We first completely characterize two variable SDPs with positive gaps; in
particular, we transform them into a standard form that makes the positive gap
trivial to recognize. The transformation is very simple, as it mostly uses
elementary row operations coming from Gaussian elimination. We next show that
the two variable case sheds light on larger SDPs with positive gaps: we present
SDPs in any dimension in which the positive gap is caused by the same structure
as in the two variable case. We analyze a fundamental parameter, the {\em
singularity degree} of the duals of our SDPs, and show that it is the largest
that can result in a positive gap.
  We finally generate a library of difficult SDPs with positive gaps (some of
these SDPs have only two variables) and present a computational study.

71% of the tracks for at least 2 min. We provide validated trajectories

derived while neglecting the phase acquired at disordered contacts, and this

with radially directed flows of dark matter (RDM-star). In this model, a cutoff
by quantum gravity (QG) creates a core of Planck density, filled with a gas of
Planck mass particles, inside the star.
  Further, in this model, a fast radio burst (FRB) can be generated via the
following mechanism. An object of an asteroid mass falls onto an RDM-star. Due
to large gravitational forces available in the interior, the RDM-star works as
a powerful accelerator, boosting the nucleons composing the object to extremely
high energies. Upon collision with the core, the nucleons enter in deeply
inelastic reactions with the Planck particles composing the core. This process
is followed by stimulated emission of highly energetic photons. On the way
outside, these photons are subjected to a strong redshift factor, downscaling
their frequencies to the radio diapason, as a result producing an FRB.
  A straightforward computation gives a characteristic upper FRB frequency of
0.6GHz. With attenuation factors, it is stretched to a range 0.35-8GHz, fitting
well with the observable FRB frequencies. We also discuss the reconstruction of
other FRB parameters in frames of the model.

cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test

the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a
target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization,
and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework.
Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior,
covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide
variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting,
subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax
estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will
discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open

the stability of this oxide-layer.
  The point defect model originally advanced by Digby Macdonald and perfected
into a correct and complete theory by Bosco Emmanuel provides a concrete basis
for investigating this stability question. We have formulated a system of 3
coupled differential equations (2 PDEs and one ODE) with appropriate initial
and boundary conditions that include the defect injection reactions. This
system of equations recognize the diffusion, migration and clustering of the
point defects in the oxide-layer. The defect clustering is modelled using the
Avrami Theorem and the area-volume laws for random agglomerates.

with the oxide-layer breakdown and the periodic, aperiodic and chaotic
oscillations in the electrical current / potential which signal the breakdown
of the passive oxide-layer. A large body of experimental data is waiting to be

density of our Universe. Various tests have been proposed to test this
hypothesis. One of the cleanest tests is the lensing of fast radio bursts. In
this situation, the presence of a compact object near the line of sight
produces two images of the radio burst. If the images are sufficiently
separated in time, this technique can constrain the presence of primordial
black holes. One can also try to detect the lensed image of the mini-bursts
within the main burst. We show that this technique can produce the leading
constraints over a wide range in lens masses $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_\odot$ if the
primordial black holes follow a single mass distribution. Even if the
primordial black holes have an extended mass distribution, the constraints that
can be derived from lensing of fast radio bursts will be the most constraining
over wide ranges of the parameter space. We show that this technique can probe
exotic compact boson stars and fermion stars made up of beyond the Standard
Model particles. This search strategy is competitive and can provide the
leading constraints on parts of the particle physics parameter space when
compared with gravitational wave observations.

a comfortable driving environment by delivering early warning and infotainment
messages to the drivers. Jamming attacks, however, pose a significant threat to
their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Relative Speed Estimation
Algorithm (RSEA) of a moving interfering vehicle that approaches a Transmitter
($Tx$) - Receiver ($Rx$) pair, that interferes with their Radio Frequency (RF)
communication by conducting a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Our scheme is
completely sensorless and passive and uses a pilot-based received signal
without hardware or computational cost in order to, firstly, estimate the
combined channel between the transmitter - receiver and jammer - receiver and
secondly, to estimate the jamming signal and the relative speed between the
jammer - receiver using the RF Doppler shift. Moreover, the relative speed
metric exploits the Angle of Projection (AOP) of the speed vector of the jammer
in the axis of its motion in order to form a two-dimensional representation of
the geographical area. This approach can effectively be applied both for a
jamming signal completely unknown to the receiver and for a jamming signal
partly known to the receiver. Our speed estimator method is proven to have
quite accurate performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value of
approximately $10\%$ compared to the optimal zero MAE value under different
jamming attack scenarios.

topological and metric properties of the space of GENEOs to evaluate their
approximating power and set the basis for general strategies to initialise and

compact and convex, under the assumption that the function spaces are compact

perspective. We show examples on the MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets. By
considering isometry-equivariant non-expansive operators, we describe a simple
strategy to select and sample operators, and show how the selected and sampled

garnered much recent attention. In this work, we propose a paradigmatic brick
lattice model where corner modes requires protection by nonsymmorphic symmetry
in addition to two commuting mirror symmetries. Unlike the well-known square
corner mode lattice, it has an odd number of occupied bands, which necessitates
a different definition for the $\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2$ topological
invariant. By studying both the quadrupolar polarization and effective edge
model, our study culminates in a phase diagram containing two distinct
topological regimes. Our brick lattice corner modes can be realized in a RLC

studies in several disciplines with a major application for biomedical
research. Essentially, clustering algorithms are executed by machines aiming at
finding groups of related points in a dataset. However, the result of grouping
depends on both metrics for point-to-point similarity and rules for
point-to-group association. Indeed, non-appropriate metrics and rules can lead
to undesirable clustering artifacts. This is especially relevant for datasets,
where groups with heterogeneous structures co-exist. In this work, we propose
an algorithm that achieves clustering by exploring the paths between points.
This allows both, to evaluate the properties of the path (such as gaps, density
variations, etc.), and expressing the preference for certain paths. Moreover,
our algorithm supports the integration of existing knowledge about admissible
and non-admissible clusters by training a path classifier. We demonstrate the
accuracy of the proposed method on challenging datasets including points from
synthetic shapes in publicly available benchmarks and microscopy data.

However, practically, the 3D shape of the measured surface can hardly be fully

reflexivity characteristics, which lead to low fringe quality and intensity
saturation. To address this problem, we propose to calculate phases of these

significantly improved. The ultimate phase maps obtained from unsaturated

application of Legendre polynomials and trigonometric functions to the
numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations in the framework
of the method of approximation of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic
integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series. On the example of
iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 3, included in the
Taylor-Ito expansion, it is shown that expansions of stochastic integrals based
on Legendre polynomials are much easier and require significantly less
computational costs compared to their analogues obtained using the
trigonometric system of functions. The results of the article can be useful for
construction of high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic
differential equations.

  bi-calibrated interpolation on the Grassmann manifold","25 pages",,,,"math.NA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximating solutions of non-linear parametrized physical problems by
interpolation presents a major challenge in terms of accuracy. In fact,
pointwise interpolation of such solutions is rarely efficient and leads
generally to incorrect results. However, instead of using a straight forward
interpolation on solutions, reduced order models can be interpolated. More
particularly, Amsallem and Farhat proposed an efficient POD reduced order model
interpolation technique based on differential geometry tools. This approach,
named in this paper ITSGM (Interpolation On a Tangent Space of the Grassmann
Manifold), allows through the passage to the tangent space of the Grassmann
manifold, to approximate accurately the reduced order basis associated to a new
untrained parameter. This basis is used afterwards to build the interpolated
ROM describing the temporal dynamics by performing the Galerkin projection on
the high fidelity model. Such Galerkin ROMs require to access to the underlying
high fidelity model, leading by that to intrusive ROMs. In this paper, and
contrary to the ITSGM/Galerkin approach, we propose a non-intrusive reduced
order modeling method which is independent of the governing equations. This
method is named through this paper Bi-CITSGM (Bi-Calibrated ITSGM). It consists
first to interpolate the spatial and temporal POD sampling bases considered as
representatives of points on Grassmann manifolds, by the ITSGM method. Then,
the resulting bases modes are reclassified by introducing two orthogonal
matrices. These calibration matrices are determined as analytical solutions of
two optimization problems. Results on the flow problem past a circular cylinder
where the parameter of interpolation is the Reynolds number, show that for new
untrained Reynolds number values, the developed approach produces satisfyingly
accurate solutions in a real computational time.

not maintained the same pace. New methods have to be explored to reduce this
gap between traffic and revenue. One such method is convergence in networking
layers. In this work, we study the convergence of OTN and DWDM layer from a
network planning perspective. We compare the costs of planning networks without

for higher traffic volumes.

its projected market demand and increasing popularity of cycling in the
Philippines, cyclists are slowly adopting this technology in their daily
cycling routines. Activity trackers demonstrate real-time data which allow
cyclists to adjust physical efforts to achieve their personal goals. Six common
features of activity trackers were formed as constructs to explore its
influence on health empowerment in the context of cycling using Partial Least
Squares Structural Equation Model. A total of 393 cyclists in the Philippines
participated in the study. Some features demonstrated strong evidence of
positive influence in achieving health empowerment and commitment. Implications
for future design and development of this technology device are discussed.

that enable researchers to explore this topic. In order to spur that research,
we release the Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD), which consists of 160
million listening sessions and associated user actions. Furthermore, we provide
audio features and metadata for the approximately 3.7 million unique tracks
referred to in the logs. This is the largest collection of such track metadata
currently available to the public. This dataset enables research on important
problems including how to model user listening and interaction behaviour in
streaming, as well as Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and session-based
sequential recommendations. Additionally, a subset of sessions were collected
using a uniformly random recommendation setting, enabling their use for
counterfactual evaluation of such sequential recommendations. Finally, we
provide an analysis of user behavior and suggest further research problems
which can be addressed using the dataset.

femtosecond-laser subwavelength structuring always give rise to great
enhancement for strong-field ionization as well as third-order nonlinear
optical effects, which is the direct evidence of great local field enhancement
in subwavelength apertures of fs-laser highly-excited surface. In short, the
study shows the prominent subwavelength spatial effect of strong-field
ionization in femtosecond-laser ablation of dielectrics, which greatly
contributes to the well-known ""incubation effect"".
