efficient manner to deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on mobile devices with
limited capacity. The cloud-based solution is a promising approach to enabling
deep learning applications on mobile devices where the large portions of a DNN
are offloaded to the cloud. However, revealing data to the cloud leads to
potential privacy risk. To benefit from the cloud data center without the
privacy risk, we design, evaluate, and implement a cloud-based framework ARDEN
which partitions the DNN across mobile devices and cloud data centers. A simple
data transformation is performed on the mobile device, while the
resource-hungry training and the complex inference rely on the cloud data
center. To protect the sensitive information, a lightweight privacy-preserving
mechanism consisting of arbitrary data nullification and random noise addition
is introduced, which provides strong privacy guarantee. A rigorous privacy
budget analysis is given. Nonetheless, the private perturbation to the original
data inevitably has a negative impact on the performance of further inference
on the cloud side. To mitigate this influence, we propose a noisy training
method to enhance the cloud-side network robustness to perturbed data. Through
the sophisticated design, ARDEN can not only preserve privacy but also improve
the inference performance. To validate the proposed ARDEN, a series of
experiments based on three image datasets and a real mobile application are
conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARDEN.
Finally, we implement ARDEN on a demo system to verify its practicality.

Two DMAPS prototypes that use the same ""column-drain"" readout architecture and

TJ-Monopix have been developed for the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large
Hardon Collider (HL-LHC). LF-Monopix was fabricated in the LFoundry 150 nm
technology and features pixel size of $50x250~\mu m^{2}$ and large collection
electrode opted for high radiation tolerance. Detection efficiency up to 99\%
has been measured after irradiation to $1\cdot10^{15}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$.
TJ-Monopix is a large scale $(1x2~cm^{2})$ prototype featuring pixels of
$36x40~\mu m^{2}$ size. It was fabricated in a novel TowerJazz 180 nm modified
process that enables full depletion of the sensitive layer, while employing a
small collection electrode that is less sensitive to crosstalk. The resulting
small sensor capacitance ($<=3~fF$) is exploited by a compact, low power front
end optimized to meet the 25ns timing requirement. Measurement results
demonstrate the sensor performance in terms of Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC)
$\approx11e^{-}$, threshold $\approx300~e^-$, threshold dispersion
$\approx30~e^-$ and total power consumption lower than $120~mW/cm^2$.

step in understanding the structure of the gaseous hot haloes that surround our
own and other galaxies. However, the two main categories of models that are
used in the literature are poorly suited for this task: (i) simple barotropic
models are analytic and can therefore be adjusted to match the observations,
but are clearly unrealistic because the rotational velocity $v_\phi(R,z)$ does
not depend on the distance $z$ from the galactic plane, while (ii) models
obtained as a result of cosmological galaxy formation simulations are more
realistic, but are impractical to fit to observations due to high computational
cost. Here we bridge this gap by presenting a general method to construct
axisymmetric baroclinic equilibrium models of rotating galactic coronae in
arbitrary external potentials. We consider in particular a family of models
whose equipressure surfaces in the $(R,z)$ plane are ellipses of varying axis
ratio. These models are defined by two one-dimensional functions, the axial
ratio of pressure $q_{\rm axis}(z)$ and the value of the pressure $P_{\rm
axis}(z)$ along the galaxy's symmetry axis. These models can have a rotation
speed $v_\phi(R,z)$ that realistically decreases as one moves away from the
galactic plane, and can reproduce the angular momentum distribution found in
cosmological simulations. The models are computationally cheap to construct and
can thus be used in fitting algorithms. We provide a python code that given
$q_{\rm axis}(z)$, $P_{\rm axis}(z)$ and $\Phi(R,z)$ returns $\rho(R,z)$,
$T(R,z)$, $P(R,z)$, $v_\phi(R,z)$. We show a few examples of these models using

approach projects the bipartite data in each time period to a unipartite
network and uses existing unipartite network models. Unfortunately, information
is lost in calculating the projection and generative models for networks

dependencies using two unipartite \emph{influence networks}, corresponding to

  Registration","13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis, aiming to establish a dense and non-linear correspondence between a
pair of images. Previous deep-learning studies usually employ supervised neural
networks to directly learn the spatial transformation from one image to
another, requiring task-specific ground-truth registration for model training.
Due to the difficulty in collecting precise ground-truth registration,
implementation of these supervised methods is practically challenging. Although
several unsupervised networks have been recently developed, these methods
usually ignore the inherent inverse-consistent property (essential for
diffeomorphic mapping) of transformations between a pair of images. Also,
existing approaches usually encourage the to-be-estimated transformation to be
locally smooth via a smoothness constraint only, which could not completely
avoid folding in the resulting transformation. To this end, we propose an
Inverse-Consistent deep Network (ICNet) for unsupervised deformable image
registration. Specifically, we develop an inverse-consistent constraint to
encourage that a pair of images are symmetrically deformed toward one another,
until both warped images are matched. Besides using the conventional smoothness
constraint, we also propose an anti-folding constraint to further avoid folding
in the transformation. The proposed method does not require any supervision
information, while encouraging the diffeomoprhic property of the transformation
via the proposed inverse-consistent and anti-folding constraints. We evaluate
our method on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for
tissue segmentation and anatomical landmark detection, with results
demonstrating the superior performance of our ICNet over several
state-of-the-art approaches for deformable image registration. Our code will be
made publicly available.

paper, we present an approach which aims to preserve more shape details and

object mask and pose estimation from CNNs to assist the 3D shape learning by
constructing a probabilistic single-view visual hull inside of the network. Our
method works by first predicting a coarse shape as well as the object pose and
silhouette using CNNs, followed by a novel 3D refinement CNN which refines the

the unknown function of interest is usually treated as a Gaussian process with
assumed stationary covariance with hyperparameters estimated from data. In
PhIK, we compute the mean and covariance function from realizations of
available stochastic models, e.g., from realizations of governing stochastic
partial differential equations solutions. Such constructed Gaussian process
generally is non-stationary, and does not assume a specific form of the
covariance function. Our approach avoids the optimization step in data-driven
GPR methods to identify the hyperparameters. More importantly, we prove that
the physical constraints in the form of a deterministic linear operator are
guaranteed in the resulting prediction. We also provide an error estimate in
preserving the physical constraints when errors are included in the stochastic
model realizations. To reduce the computational cost of obtaining stochastic
model realizations, we propose a multilevel Monte Carlo estimate of the mean

limit of the evolution of the cluster of a tagged vertex in the stationary
state of the mean field forest fire model of R\'ath and T\'oth. We describe its
explosions in terms of a L\'evy subordinator, using a state-dependent time
change.
  The steady state cluster is also a multitype Galton-Watson tree with a
continuum of types. The steady state cluster conditioned on its size is a
random weighted spanning tree of the complete graph equipped random edge
weights with a simple explicit joint distribution. The time-reversal of the

using audio as a carrier of information hiding. At present, almost all
audio-based information hiding methods are based on carrier modification mode.
However, this mode is equivalent to adding noise to the original signal,
resulting in a difference in the statistical feature distribution of the
carrier before and after steganography, which impairs the concealment of the
entire system. In this paper, we propose an automatic audio generation-based
steganography(AAG-Stega), which can automatically generate high-quality audio
covers on the basis of the secret bits stream that needs to be embedded. In the

by a positive feedback mechanism of aggregate nucleation and growth which is
mediated by a flux maintaining the phase equilibrium between the compartment

maximizes aggregate enrichment in the compartment is determined by the reaction

terms. Namely, it occurs when for some pair of observables, there is no
preparation, for which they both exhibit deterministic statistics. However, the
right-hand side of uncertainty relation is generally not operational as it
depends on the quantum formalism. Also, while joint non-measurability of
observables is an operational notion, the complementarity in Bohr sense (i.e.
excess of information needed to describe the system) has not yet been expressed
in purely operational terms.
  In this paper we propose a solution to these problems, by introducing an
operational definition for complementarity, and further postulating uncertainty
as a necessary price for complementarity in physical theories. In other words,
we propose to put the (operational) complementarity as the right-hand side of
uncertainty relation.
  Concretely, we first identify two different notions of uncertainty and
complementarity for which the above principle holds in quantum mechanics. We
also introduce postulates for the general measures of uncertainty and
complementarity. In order to define quantifiers of complementarity we first
turn to the simpler notion of independence that is defined solely in terms of
statistics two observables.
  We also use our framework to define new complementarity indicators based on
(i) performance of random access codes, (ii) geometrical properties of the body
of observed statistics, and (iii) variation of information. We then show that
they can be used to state uncertainty relations. Moreover, we show that
non-signaling and uncertainty relation expressed by complementarity of type
(ii) leads to the Tsirelson bound for CHSH inequality. Lastly, we show that a
variant of Information Causality called Information Content Principle, can be
interpreted as uncertainty relation in the above sense.

existing unified framework to homogenize the problem formulation,
representation simplification, and evaluation metric for various prediction
methods, such as probabilistic graphical models (PGM), neural networks (NN) and
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In this paper, we formulate a
probabilistic reaction prediction problem, and reveal the relationship between
reaction and situation prediction problems. We employ prototype trajectories
with designated motion patterns other than ""intention"" to homogenize the
representation so that probabilities corresponding to each trajectory generated
by different methods can be evaluated. We also discuss the reasons why
""intention"" is not suitable to serve as a motion indicator in highly
interactive scenarios. We propose to use Brier score as the baseline metric for
evaluation. In order to reveal the fatality of the consequences when the
predictions are adopted by decision-making and planning, we propose a
fatality-aware metric, which is a weighted Brier score based on the criticality
of the trajectory pairs of the interacting entities. Conservatism and
non-defensiveness are defined from the weighted Brier score to indicate the
consequences caused by inaccurate predictions. Modified methods based on PGM,
NN and IRL are provided to generate probabilistic reaction predictions in an
exemplar scenario of nudging from a highway ramp. The results are evaluated by
the baseline and proposed metrics to construct a mini benchmark. Analysis on
the properties of each method is also provided by comparing the baseline and
proposed metric scores.

single-output system. Transmission is amplitude-constrained to maintain
operation within the light emitting diodes' dynamic range. Achievable secrecy
rate regions are derived under such amplitude constraints for this
multi-receiver wiretap channel, first for direct transmission without the
relays, and then for multiple relaying schemes: cooperative jamming,
decode-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward. Superposition coding with uniform
signaling is used at the transmitter and the relays. Further, for each relaying
scheme, secure beamforming vectors are carefully designed at the relay nodes in

Superiority of the proposed relaying schemes, with secure beamforming, is shown

Sen-Ashtekar-Immirzi-Barbero variables, of a spacetime admitting an isolated
horizon as the inner boundary, involves a positive constant parameter, say
$\sigma$, if $\gamma\neq\pm i$, where $\gamma$ is the Barbero-Immirzi
parameter. The parameter $\sigma$ represents the rescaling freedom that
characterizes the equivalence class of null generators of the isolated horizon.
We reiterate the fact that the laws of mechanics associated with the isolated
horizon does not depend on the choice of $\sigma$ and, in particular, while one
uses the value of standard surface gravity as input, that does not fix $\sigma$
to a particular value. This fact contradicts the claims made in certain parts
of the concerned literature that we duly refer to. We do the calculations by
taking Schwarzschild metric as an example so that the contradiction with the
referred literature, where similar approaches were adopted, becomes apparent.
The contribution to the symplectic structure that comes from the isolated
horizon, diverges for $\sigma^2=(1+\gamma^2)^{-1}$, implying that the rescaling
symmetry of the isolated horizon is violated for any real $\gamma$. Since the
quantum theory of $SU(2)$ isolated horizon in the LQG framework exists only for
real values of $\gamma$, it is founded on this flawed classical setup.
Nevertheless, if the flaw is ignored, then two different viewpoints persist in
the literature for entropy calculation. We highlight the main features of those
approaches and point out why one is logically viable and the other is not.

gravitons at loop order. The operator proportional to $\tilde m_4^2$ generates
a calculable, non-Lorentz invariant higher-derivative correction to the
graviton propagation. The modification of the dispersion relation provides a
bound on $\tilde m_4^2$ comparable to the one of the decay. Conversely,
operators up to cubic Horndeski do not generate sizeable higher-derivative
corrections.

generally requires clusters to lose $>90$ per cent of their birth mass. We use
a suite of 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of present-day Milky Way-mass
galaxies from the \emosaics project to study whether dynamical disruption by
evaporation and tidal shocking provides the necessary mass loss. We find that
GCs with present-day masses $M>10^5~M_{\odot}$ were only $2$-$4$ times more
massive at birth, in conflict with the requirements of the proposed models.
This factor correlates weakly with metallicity, gas pressure at birth, or
galactocentric radius, but increases towards lower GC masses. To reconcile our
results with observational data, either an unphysically steep cluster mass-size

their present values. We provide the required relation between the initial

particular quantum states. Because the dynamics rigorously obeys detailed
balance, rate constants can be evaluated from reversible work calculations in
this conditioned ensemble, allowing for branching ratios and yields to be
computed in an unbiased manner. We illustrate the utility of this method with
three examples: energy transfer in a donor-bridge-acceptor model, and models of
photo-induced proton-coupled electron transfer and thermally activated electron
transfer. These examples demonstrate the efficacy of path ensemble methods and
pave the way for their use in studying of complex reactive quantum dynamics.

well characterized 3-D orbits. They are nearly coplanar to each other; the
inner one has a large eccentricity (~0.82); and the apses of the two orbits
librate around anti-alignment. Such a state defies available proposals for
large eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a
decaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional
effect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned
state. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are
adiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or
rather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and
the two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial
mutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with
the current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet
eccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and
in secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs. The mechanism discussed here may
be relevant for forming hot Jupiters and for explaining the observed
eccentricities of warm and cold giant planets.

fast approximate simulations (BGM FASt) to address fundamental questions of the
Galactic structure and evolution performing multi-parameter inference. As a
first application of our strategy we simultaneously infer the IMF, the star
formation history and the stellar mass density in the Solar Neighbourhood. The
BGM FASt strategy is based on a reweighing scheme, that uses a specific
pre-sampled simulation, and on the assumption that the distribution function of
the generated stars in the Galaxy can be described by an analytical expression.
To validate BGM FASt we execute a set of tests. Finally, we use BGM FASt with
an approximate Bayesian computation algorithm to obtain the posterior PDF of
the inferred parameters, by comparing synthetic versus Tycho-2 colour-magnitude
diagrams. Results: The validation shows a very good agreement between BGM FASt
and the standard BGM, with BGM FASt being $\approx 10^4$ times faster. By
analysing Tycho-2 data we obtain a thin disc star formation history decreasing
in time and a present rate of $1.2 \pm 0.2 M_\odot/yr$. The resulting total
stellar mass density in the Solar Neighbourhood is $0.051_{-0.005}^{+0.002}
M_\odot/pc^3$ and the local dark matter density is $0.012 \pm 0.001
M_\odot/pc^3$. For the composite IMF we obtain a slope of
$\alpha_2={2.1}_{-0.3}^{+0.1}$ in the mass range between $0.5 M_\odot$ and
$1.53M_\odot$. The results of the slope at the high mass range are trustable up
to $4M_\odot$ and highly depend on the choice of the extinction map (obtaining
$\alpha_3={2.9}_{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ and $\alpha_3={3.7}_{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ respectively,
for two different extinction maps). Systematic uncertainties are not included.
Conclusions: The good performance of BGM FASt demonstrates that it is a very
valuable tool to perform multi-parameter inference using Gaia data releases.

(50$^{\prime\prime}$ x 20$^{\prime\prime}$) on the 2.3-meter Bok telescope at
Kitt Peak, USA for seeing-limited observations at moderate spectral resolving
power. The measured spatial sampling scale is $\sim1\times1^{\prime\prime}$ and
its spectral resolving power is $R\sim2,500$ and $3,000$ in the $zJ$
($0.9-1.35$ $\mu$m) and $H_{short}$ ($1.5-1.7$ $\mu$m) modes, respectively.
WIFIS's corresponding etendue is larger than existing near-infrared (NIR)
IFSes, which are mostly designed to work with adaptive optics systems and
therefore have very narrow fields. For this reason, this instrument is
specifically suited for studying very extended objects in the near-infrared
such as supernovae remnants, galactic star forming regions, and nearby
galaxies, which are not easily accessible by other NIR IFSes. This enables
scientific programs that were not originally possible, such as detailed surveys
of a large number of nearby galaxies or a full accounting of nucleosynthetic
yields of Milky Way supernova remnants. WIFIS is also designed to be easily
adaptable to be used with larger telescopes. In this paper, we report on the
overall performance characteristics of the instrument, which were measured
during our commissioning runs in the second half of 2017. We present
measurements of spectral resolving power, image quality, instrumental
background, and overall efficiency and sensitivity of WIFIS and compare them

how this turbulence is generated and maintained is unknown. One possibility is
that stars forming within the cloud regenerate turbulence via their outflows,
winds and radiation (""feedback""). Disentangling motions created by feedback
from the initial cloud turbulence is challenging, however. Here we confront the
relationship between stellar feedback and turbulence by identifying and
separating the local and global impact of stellar winds. We analyze
magnetohydrodyanamic simulations in which we track wind material as it
interacts with the ambient cloud. By distinguishing between launched material,
gas entrained by the wind and pristine gas we show energy is transferred away
from the sources via magnetic waves excited by the expanding wind shells. This
action at a distance enhances the fraction of stirring motion compared to
compressing motion and produces a flatter velocity power spectrum. We conclude
stellar feedback accounts for significant energy transfer within molecular
clouds, an impact enhanced by magnetic waves, which have previously been
neglected by observations. Altogether, stellar feedback can partially offset
global turbulence dissipation.

z~1.6 cluster galaxies, all within a single 70"" primary beam, in under 3 hours
of integration time. The cluster, SpARCS-J0225, is replete with gas-rich
galaxies in close proximity. It thus affords an efficient multiplexing strategy
to build up the first sample of resolved CO in distant galaxy clusters. Mapping
out the kinematic structure and morphology of the molecular gas on 3.5 kpc
scales reveals rotating gas disks in the majority of the galaxies, as evidenced
by smooth velocity gradients. Detailed velocity maps also uncover kinematic
peculiarities, including a central gas void, a merger, and a few one-sided gas
tails. We compare the extent of the molecular gas component to that of the
optical stellar component, measured with rest-frame optical HST imaging. We
find that the cluster galaxies, while broadly consistent with a ratio of unity
for stellar-to-gas effective radii, have a moderately larger ratio compared to
the coeval field; this is consistent with the more pronounced trend in the
low-redshift Universe. Thus, at first glance, the z~1.6 cluster galaxies
generally look like galaxies infalling from the field, with typical
main-sequence star formation rates and massive molecular gas reservoirs
situated in rotating disks. However, there are potentially important
differences from their field counterparts, including elevated gas fractions,
slightly smaller CO disks, and possible asymmetric gas tails. Taken in tandem,
these signatures are tentative evidence for gas-stripping in the z~1.6 cluster.
However, the current sample size of spatially-resolved molecular gas in
galaxies at high redshift is small, and verification of these trends will
require much larger samples of both cluster and field galaxies.

of the reduced density matrix, plays an important role within the AdS/CFT
correspondence in view of its relation to quantum information. In particular,
it is an essential ingredient for quantum information measures of distances
between states, such as the relative entropy and the Fisher information metric.
However, the modular Hamiltonian is known explicitly only for a few examples.
For a family of states $\rho_\lambda$ that is parametrized by a scalar
$\lambda$, the first order contribution in $\tilde\lambda=\lambda-\lambda_0$ of
the modular Hamiltonian to the relative entropy between $\rho_\lambda$ and a
reference state $\rho_{\lambda_0}$ is completely determined by the entanglement
entropy, via the first law of entanglement. For several examples, e.g. for
ball-shaped regions in the ground state of CFTs, higher order contributions are
known to vanish. In these cases the modular Hamiltonian contributes to the
Fisher information metric in a trivial way. We investigate under which
conditions the modular Hamiltonian provides a non-trivial contribution to the
Fisher information metric, i.e. when the contribution of the modular
Hamiltonian to the relative entropy is of higher order in $\tilde{\lambda}$. We
consider one-parameter families of reduced states on two entangling regions
that form an entanglement plateau, i.e. the entanglement entropies of the two
regions saturate the Araki-Lieb inequality. We show that in general, at least
one of the relative entropies of the two entangling regions is expected to
involve $\tilde{\lambda}$ contributions of higher order from the modular
Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we consider the implications of this observation for
prominent AdS/CFT examples that form entanglement plateaux in the large $N$

evolution simulations, binary population synthesis models, and nucleosynthesis
calculations. Our motivation is to define which astrophysical sites have
significantly contributed to the total mass of r-process elements present in
our Galaxy. We found discrepancies with the neutron star (NS-NS) merger
scenario. Assuming they are the only site, the decreasing trend of [Eu/Fe] at
[Fe/H]\,$>-1$ in the disk of the Milky Way cannot be reproduced while
accounting for the delay-time distribution (DTD) of coalescence times
($\propto~t^{-1}$) derived from short gamma-ray bursts and population synthesis
models. Steeper DTD functions ($\propto~t^{-1.5}$) or power laws combined with
a strong burst of mergers before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae can reproduce
the [Eu/Fe] trend, but this scenario is inconsistent with the similar fraction
of short gamma-ray bursts and Type~Ia supernovae occurring in early-type
galaxies, and reduces the probability of detecting GW170817 in an early-type
galaxy. One solution is to assume an extra production site of Eu that would be
active in the early universe, but would fade away with increasing metallicity.
If this is correct, this extra site could be responsible for roughly 50% of the
Eu production in the early universe, before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae.
Rare classes of supernovae could be this additional r-process source, but
hydrodynamic simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust
r-process pattern.

Here we describe a series of distinct colors and emission line strengths,

We predict that the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope might be able to
detect and distinguish a young galaxy that hosts a direct-collapse black hole
in this configuration at redshift 15 with as little as a 20,000-second total

We build on the idea that the clustering properties of merging binary black

cross-correlation of galaxy with gravitational wave catalogues carries
information about whether black hole mergers trace more closely the
distribution of dark matter -- indicative of primordial origin -- or that of

electricity signal of a whole home to its operating devices. First, we cast the
problem as a dictionary learning (DL) problem where the key electricity
patterns representing consumption behaviors are extracted for each device and
stored in a dictionary matrix. The electricity signal of each device is then
modeled by a linear combination of such patterns with sparse coefficients that
determine the contribution of each device in the total electricity. Although
popular, the classic DL approach is prone to high error in real-world
applications including energy disaggregation, as it merely finds linear
dictionaries. Moreover, this method lacks a recurrent structure; thus, it is
unable to leverage the temporal structure of energy signals. Motivated by such
shortcomings, we propose a novel optimization program where the dictionary and
its sparse coefficients are optimized simultaneously with a deep neural model
extracting powerful nonlinear features from the energy signals. A long
short-term memory auto-encoder (LSTM-AE) is proposed with tunable time
dependent states to capture the temporal behavior of energy signals for each
device. We learn the dictionary in the space of temporal features captured by
the LSTM-AE rather than the original space of the energy signals; hence, in
contrast to the traditional DL, here, a nonlinear dictionary is learned using
powerful temporal features extracted from our deep model. Real experiments on
the publicly available Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD) show
significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies in terms
of the disaggregation accuracy and F-score metrics.

This guest star occurred in the ancient Chinese asterism Nan-Dou, which is part
of Sagittarius. The X-ray morphology of G7.7-3.7 shows an arc-like feature in
the SNR south, which is characterized by an under-ionized plasma with sub-solar
abundances, a temperature of 0.4--0.8 keV, and a density of $\sim 0.5(d/4
kpc)^{-0.5}$ cm$^{-3}$. A small shock age of $1.2\pm 0.6 (d/4 kpc)^{0.5}$ kyr
is inferred from the low ionization timescale of $2.4^{+1.1}_{-1.3}\times
10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s of the X-ray arc. The low foreground absorption
($N_H=3.5\pm0.5\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) of G7.7-3.7 made the supernova
explosion visible to the naked eyes on the Earth. The position of G7.7-3.7 is
consistent with the event of 386 CE, and the X-ray properties suggest that also
its age is consistent. Interestingly, the association between G7.7-3.7 and
guest star 386 would suggest the supernova to be a low-luminosity supernova, in
order to explain the not very long visibility (2--4 months) of the guest star.

dynamical evolution of ensembles of multiple systems mimicking each one of the

the best available values for the masses, the observed positions and {\bf

line-of-sight ($z$) positions for all components. Random perturbations were
assigned to the observed quantities, compatible with the observational errors.
A large fraction of the simulated systems ({\bf between 70 and 90 percent})
turned out to be unbound. The properties of the evolving systems are studied at
different values of the evolution time. We find that the dynamical lifetimes of
both the bound and unbound seems to be quite short, of less than 10~000 yr for
the unbound systems, and of 10~000 to 20~000 yr for the bound systems. The end
result of the simulations is usually a binary {\bf with semiaxes of a few

algebraic objects appearing in matroid theory: both partial fields and
hyperfields are fuzzy rings, fuzzy rings are tracts, and these relations are
compatible with the respective matroid theories. Moreover, fuzzy rings are
ordered blueprints and lie in the intersection of tracts with ordered
blueprints; we call the objects of this intersection pastures.
  In the second part, we construct moduli spaces for matroids over pastures. We
show that, for any non-empty finite set $E$, the functor taking a pasture $F$
to the set of isomorphism classes of rank-$r$ $F$-matroids on $E$ is
representable by an ordered blue scheme $Mat(r,E)$, the moduli space of
rank-$r$ matroids on $E$.
  In the third part, we draw conclusions on matroid theory. A classical
rank-$r$ matroid $M$ on $E$ corresponds to a $\mathbb{K}$-valued point of
$Mat(r,E)$ where $\mathbb{K}$ is the Krasner hyperfield. Such a point defines a
residue pasture $k_M$, which we call the universal pasture of $M$. We show that
for every pasture $F$, morphisms $k_M\to F$ are canonically in bijection with
$F$-matroid structures on $M$.
  An analogous weak universal pasture $k_M^w$ classifies weak $F$-matroid
structures on $M$. The unit group of $k_M^w$ can be canonically identified with
the Tutte group of $M$. We call the sub-pasture $k_M^f$ of $k_M^w$ generated by
``cross-ratios' the foundation of $M$,. It parametrizes rescaling classes of
weak $F$-matroid structures on $M$, and its unit group is coincides with the
inner Tutte group of $M$. We show that a matroid $M$ is regular if and only if
its foundation is the regular partial field, and a non-regular matroid $M$ is

discussed. A popular idea is that cosmic batteries generate seed magnetic
fields which were amplified by magnetic induction due to turbulent motions, at
times combined with differential rotation. We outline a seed field mechanism,
the Biermann battery and then consider some basic ideas behind both small and
large-scale turbulent dynamos. The small-scale dynamo may help understand
magnetism in galaxy clusters and young galaxies, while the large-scale dynamo
is important for the generation of fields with scales larger than stirring, as
observed in nearby disk galaxies. Another intriguing possibility is that
magnetic fields originated at some level from the early universe.

resulting policies might perform poorly in environments that are even slightly
different. In robotics especially, training and deployment conditions often
vary and data collection is expensive, making retraining undesirable.
Simulation training allows for feasible training times, but on the other hand
suffers from a reality-gap when applied in real-world settings. This raises the
need of efficient adaptation of policies acting in new environments. We
consider this as a problem of transferring knowledge within a family of similar
Markov decision processes.
  For this purpose we assume that Q-functions are generated by some
low-dimensional latent variable. Given such a Q-function, we can find a master
policy that can adapt given different values of this latent variable. Our
method learns both the generative mapping and an approximate posterior of the
latent variables, enabling identification of policies for new tasks by
searching only in the latent space, rather than the space of all policies. The
low-dimensional space, and master policy found by our method enables policies
to quickly adapt to new environments. We demonstrate the method on both a
pendulum swing-up task in simulation, and for simulation-to-real transfer on a
pushing task.

Chiefly, we show that if one uses optimized unrestricted neural network states
as guiding functions for importance sampling the efficiency of the PQMC

systematic bias, namely that due to the finite random-walker population. The
scaling of the computational cost with the system size changes from the
exponential scaling characteristic of PQMC simulations performed without
importance sampling, to a polynomial scaling, even at the ferromagnetic quantum
critical point. The important role of the protocol chosen to sample

of thought on some compelling open problems with anomaly detection in robotic
systems. Namely, we discuss non-malicious faults, invalid data, intentional
anomalous behavior, hierarchical anomaly detection, distribution of
computation, and anomaly correction on the fly. We demonstrate the need for
additional work in these areas by providing a case study which examines the
limitations of implementing a basic anomaly detection (AD) system in the Robot
Operating System (ROS) 2 middleware. Showing that if even supporting a basic
system is a significant hurdle, the path to more complex and advanced AD
systems is even more problematic. We discuss these ROS 2 platform limitations
to support solutions in robotic anomaly detection and provide recommendations
to address the issues discovered.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Group factor analysis (GFA) methods have been widely used to infer the common
structure and the group-specific signals from multiple related datasets in
various fields including systems biology and neuroimaging. To date, most
available GFA models require Gibbs sampling or slice sampling to perform
inference, which prevents the practical application of GFA to large-scale data.
In this paper we present an efficient collapsed variational inference (CVI)
algorithm for the nonparametric Bayesian group factor analysis (NGFA) model
built upon an hierarchical beta Bernoulli process. Our CVI algorithm proceeds
by marginalizing out the group-specific beta process parameters, and then
approximating the true posterior in the collapsed space using mean field
methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
the effectiveness of our CVI algorithm for the NGFA compared with
state-of-the-art GFA methods.

underpins models for the origin of species, e.g. baryogenesis and dark matter
production. In nearly all cases the relevant cosmological observables are
computed in a general approximation, via the standard irreducible
representations found in the operator formalism of particle physics, where
intricacies related to a renormalized stress-energy tensor in a non-stationary
spacetime are ignored. Models of the early universe also include a dense
environment of quantum fields where far-from-equilibrium interactions manifest
expressions for observables with substantive corrections to the leading terms.
An alternate treatment of these cosmological observables may be carried out
within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory in curved spacetime,
where the field theoretic model of quantum matter is compatible with the
classical effects of general relativity. Here, we take the first step towards
computing such an observable. We employ the algebraic formalism while
considering far-from-equilibrium interactions in a dense environment under the
influence of a classical, yet non-stationary, spacetime to derive an expression

We call this spread the ""proximity effect"". Traditionally, the days over which
the proximity effect is felt are pre-specified in fixed windows around each
holiday, allowing no uncertainty in their identification. We are motivated by
an application to modelling daily gas demand in two large British regions. We
introduce a novel model which does not fix the days on which the proximity
effect is felt. Our approach uses a four-state, non-homogeneous hidden Markov
model, with cyclic dynamics, where the classification of days as public
holidays is observed, but the assignment of days as ""pre-holiday"",
""post-holiday"" or ""normal"" is unknown. The number of days to the preceding and
succeeding holidays guide transitions between states. We apply Bayesian

develop a simple and flexible approach to construct parametrised models of the
large-scale magnetic field of the Milky Way and other disc galaxies, based on
physically justifiable models of magnetic field structure. The resulting models
are designed to be optimised against available observational data.
Representations for the large-scale magnetic fields in the flared disc and
spherical halo of a disc galaxy were obtained in the form of series expansions
whose coefficients can be calculated from observable or theoretically known
galactic properties. The functional basis for the expansions is derived as
eigenfunctions of the mean-field dynamo equation or of the vectorial magnetic
diffusion equation. The solutions presented are axially symmetric but the
approach can be extended straightforwardly to non-axisymmetric cases. The
magnetic fields are solenoidal by construction, can be helical, and are
parametrised in terms of observable properties of the host object, such as the
rotation curve and the shape of the gaseous disc. The magnetic field in the
disc can have a prescribed number of field reversals at any specified radii.
Both the disc and halo magnetic fields can separately have either dipolar or
quadrupolar symmetry. The model is implemented as a publicly available software
package GalMag which allows, in particular, the computation of the synchrotron
emission and Faraday rotation produced by the model's magnetic field. The model
can be used in interpretations of observations of magnetic fields in the Milky
Way and other spiral galaxies, in particular as a prior in Bayesian analyses.

Stellar feedback in the first galaxies likely plays a major role in enabling
the escape of LyC photons, which contribute to the re-ionization of the

spatially resolved assessment of the feedback processes in these galaxies. We
characterize the feedback effects from the star clusters in the local
high-redshift analogue ESO 338-IG04 on the ISM and compare the results with the
properties of the most massive clusters. We use high quality VLT/MUSE optical
integral field data to derive the physical properties of the ISM such as
ionization, density, shocks, and perform new fitting of the spectral energy
distributions of the brightest clusters in ESO 338-IG04 from HST imaging. ESO
338-IG04 has a large ionized halo which we detect to a distance of 9 kpc. We
identify 4 Wolf-Rayet (WR) clusters based on the blue and red WR bump. We
follow previously identified ionization cones and find that the ionization of
the halo increases with distance. Analysis of the galaxy kinematics shows two
complex outflows driven by the numerous young clusters in the galaxy. We find a
ring of shocked emission traced by an enhanced [OI]/H$\alpha$ ratio surrounding
the starburst and at the end of the outflow. Finally we detect nitrogen
enriched gas associated with the outflow, likely caused by the WR stars in the
massive star clusters. Photo-ionization dominates the central starburst and
sets the ionization structure of the entire halo, resulting in a density
bounded halo, facilitating the escape of LyC photons. Outside the central
starburst, shocks triggered by an expanding super bubble become important. The
shocks at the end of the outflow suggest interaction between the hot outflowing
material and the more quiescent halo gas.

systems in equilibrium or processes without memory, the mathematical expression
for these different concepts of entropy appears to be the so-called
Boltzmann--Gibbs--Shannon entropy, H.For processes with memory, such as driven-

concepts lead to distinct functionals that generally differ from H. Here we
focus on the maximum configuration entropy (that predicts empirical

develop the corresponding framework and derive the entropy functional that
describes the distribution of observable states as a function of the details of
the driving process. We do this for sample space reducing (SSR) processes,
which provide an analytically tractable model for driven dissipative systems
with controllable driving. The fact that a consistent framework for a maximum
configuration entropy exists for arbitrarily driven non-equilibrium systems
opens the possibility of deriving a full statistical theory of driven
dissipative systems of this kind. This provides us with the technical means
needed~to derive a thermodynamic theory of driven processes based on a
statistical theory. We discuss the Legendre structure for driven systems.

street view images in addition to detection of pedestrian and transport modes.
The model has been trained on images of urban scenes in cities across the

nuances among the planned and the unplanned regions, including informal and
slum areas. We attempt to advance urban modelling for better understanding the
dynamics of city developments. We also aim to exemplify the significant impacts

However, there are several families of superconductors, in which
superconductivity may coexist with magnetism, and only a few examples are

known compounds are Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and some noncentrosymmetric superconductors.
Here, we report the finding of a narrow dome of a novel $s+is'$ superconducting

dome appears very close to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface
(Lifshitz transition). With this, we experimentally demonstrate the emergence
of a novel quantum state due to topological changes of the electronic system.

Veneziano Amplitude, creating sub-leading non-linearities in the Regge
trajectory of states. We formulate it as an extension of a computation by
Makeenko and Olesen. We begin in a confining gauge theory coupled to matter,
rewriting the meson scattering amplitude as a specific path integral over
shapes and sizes of closed Wilson loops using the worldline formalism. We then
prescribe how to further the computation at strong coupling by employing
holography, which provides a prescription for the expectation value of these
Wilson loops in strongly coupled regimes. We find that the problem can then be
thought of as a computation in an effective field theory of a string worldsheet
sigma model, evolving in a broad class of holographic backgrounds. A convenient
interaction picture presents itself naturally in this context, allowing us to
draw Feynman diagrams corresponding to the first few corrections due to weaker
coupling regimes. The answer we find has qualitatively the same features as
other endeavours with the same objective.

range of 1.4 < z < 3.6, has metallicities of 7.4-8.4 in 12+log(O/H) and stellar
masses 10^7.5-10^11 Msun. We test commonly used strong line diagnostics (R23,
O3, O2, O32, N2, O3N2 and Ne3O2 ) as prescribed by four different sets of
empirical calibrations, as well as one fully theoretical calibration. We find
that none of the strong line diagnostics (or calibration set) tested perform
consistently better than the others. Amongst the line ratios tested, R23 and O3
deliver the best results, with accuracies as good as 0.01-0.04 dex and
dispersions of ~0.2 dex in two of the calibrations tested. Generally, line
ratios involving nitrogen predict higher values of metallicity, while results
with O32 and Ne3O2 show large dispersions. The theoretical calibration yields
an accuracy of 0.06 dex, comparable to the best strong line methods. We
conclude that, within the metallicity range tested in this work, the locally

cycling are still not well understood. Models simulating community dynamics
overcome the technical challenges of conducting species removal experiments in

represent the organic matter processing chain which is key for soil dynamics.
Here, we present a new model of soil food web dynamics accounting for
allometric scaling of metabolic rate, ontogeny of organic matter, and explicit
representation of nitrogen and carbon flows. We use this model to investigate
what traits are best predictors of species effects on community productivity
and on nutrient cycling. To do so, we removed 161 tropho-species (groups of
functionally identical species) one at a time from 48 forest soil food webs,
and simulated their dynamics until equilibrium. Simulations revealed that
combinations of traits better determine removal effects than single ones. The
smallest species are the most competitive ones, but carnivores of various body
masses presenting the highest connectivity and resource similarity could be key
stone species in the regulation of competitive forces. Despite this, most
removals had low effects, suggesting functional redundancy provides a high
resistance of soil food webs to single tropho-species extinction. We also
highlight for the first time that food web structure and soil fertility can
drastically change species effects in an unpredictable way. Moreover, the
exclusion of detritus and stoichiometric constraints in past studies lead to
underestimations of indirect effects and retroactions. While additional work is
needed to incorporate complementarity between detritivores, it is essential to
take into account these mechanisms in models in order to improve the
understanding of soil food web functioning.

radio astronomy. The solution commonly applied by the community consists in
monitoring the statistics of the received signal, and flag out the detected
corrupted data. Subspace projection with array radio telescopes has been
suggested as an alternative to data excision to avoid important losses of data
and overcome its inherent ineffectiveness with continuous interference. Spatial
filtering relies on the estimation of the RFI spatial contribution, and the
projection of the subspace spanned by the RFI out of the observed data vector
space. To perform well, the dimensionality of the RFI subspace is constrained.
RFI subspace estimation techniques assume the source of RFI to be spatially
stationary over the sample covariance matrix evaluation. When the relative
movement between the telescope and the interferer becomes significant, the RFI
subspace gets smeared over the whole data vector space. The subspace projection
can then no longer be applied without affecting the source of interest
recovery. This paper addresses the effect of RFI subspace smearing on the
subspace projection approach, and suggests an alternative technique based on a
covariance matrix subtraction, improving the performance of spatial filtering
in the case of high subspace smearing.

lattices at T=300K with different values of grain-boundary (second) phase. The
maximum of yield strength and respective extremal grain size of the samples are
shifted by changing of the second phase. Temperature dependence in the range
100-350K for yield strength (using the example of Al) revealed its increase for
closely packed nano-crystalline samples with the growth of temperature. An
enlargement of the second phase in a sample neutralizes this property.

this problem would benefit many downstream tasks such as to translate text
classification models from resource-rich languages (e.g. English) to
low-resource languages. Supervised methods for this problem rely on the
availability of cross-lingual supervision, either using parallel corpora or
bilingual lexicons as the labeled data for training, which may not be available

approach that does not require any cross-lingual labeled data. Given two
monolingual word embedding spaces for any language pair, our algorithm
optimizes the transformation functions in both directions simultaneously based
on distributional matching as well as minimizing the back-translation losses.
We use a neural network implementation to calculate the Sinkhorn distance, a
well-defined distributional similarity measure, and optimize our objective
through back-propagation. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets for bilingual

been increasing their volume and redshift depth. To face this challenge theory
has responded by making cosmological simulations of huge computational volumes
with equally increasing the number of dark matter particles and supercomputing
resources. Thus, it is taken for granted that the ideal situation is when a
single computational box encompasses the whole effective volume of the
observational survey, e.g., ~50 Gpch^3 for the DESI and Euclid surveys. Here we
study the effects of missing long-waves in a finite volume using several
relevant statistics: the abundance of dark matter halos, the PDF, the
correlation function and power spectrum, and covariance matrices. Finite volume
effects can substantially modify the results if the computational volumes are
less than ~(500Mpch)^3. However, the effects become extremely small and
practically can be ignored when the box-size exceeds ~1Gpch^3. We find that the
average power spectra of dark matter fluctuations show remarkable lack of
dependence on the computational box-size with less than 0.1% differences
between 1Gpch and 4Gpch boxes. No measurable differences are expected for the
halo mass functions for these volumes. The covariance matrices are scaled
trivially with volume, and small corrections due to super-sample modes can be
added. We conclude that there is no need to make those extremely large
simulations when a box-size of 1-1.5Gpch is sufficient to fulfil most of the
survey science requirements.

Integrability of such equations is tightly related with the Painleve property -
solutions being free from moveable critical singularities. The problem of
Painleve classification of ordinary and partial nonlinear differential
equations lasting since the end of XIX century saw significant advances for the
equation of lower (mainly up to fourth with rare exceptions) order, however not
that much for the equations of higher orders.
  Recent works of the author have completed the Painleve classification for
several broad classes of ordinary differential equations of arbitrary order,
advancing the methodology of the Panleve analysis. This paper transfers one of
those results on a broad class of nonlinear partial differential equations -
quasilinear equations of an arbitrary order three or higher, algebraic in the
dependent variable and including only the highest order derivatives of it.
Being a first advance in Painleve classification of broad classes of arbitrary
order nonlinear PDE's known to the author, this work highlights the potential
in building classifications of that kind going beyond specific equations of a

$GL_d$-pseudocharacters of $\Gamma$ are the same as degree-$d$ characters of
$\Gamma$ with values in $k$, hence are in bijection with equivalence classes of
semisimple representations $\Gamma \rightarrow GL_d(k)$. Recently, V. Lafforgue
generalized this result by showing that, for any connected reductive group $H$
over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic 0 and for any group
$\Gamma$, there exists an infinite collection of functions and relations which
are naturally in bijection with $H^0(k)$-conjugacy classes of semisimple

Lafforgue's result in terms of a new algebraic object called an FFG-algebra. We
then define generating sets and generating relations for these objects and show
that, for all $H$ as above, the corresponding FFG-algebra is finitely
presented. Hence we can always define $H$-pseudocharacters consisting of
finitely many functions satisfying finitely many relations. Next, we use
invariant theory to give explicit finite presentations of the FFG-algebras for

paper, we develop a new method to identify and locate the transients
automatically from simultaneous images from the two inner telescopes, known as
HI-1, based on a correlation analysis. Correlation coefficient (cc) maps along
the Sun-Earth line are constructed for the period from 1 Jan 2010 to 28 Feb
2011. From the maps, transients propagating along the Sun-Earth line are
identified, and a 27-day periodic pattern is revealed, especially for
small-scale transients. Such a periodicity in the transient pattern is
consistent with the rotation of the Sun's global magnetic structure and the
periodic crossing of the streamer structures and slow solar wind across the
Sun-Earth line, and this substantiates the reliability of our method and the
high degree of association between the small-scale transients of the slow solar
wind and the coronal streamers. Besides, it is suggested by the cc map that
small-scale transients along the Sun-Earth line are more frequent than
large-scale transients by a factor of at least 2, and that they quickly
diffused into background solar wind within about 40 Rs in terms of the
signal-to-noise ratio of white-light emissions. The method provides a new tool
to reconstruct inhomogeneous structures in the heliosphere from multiple

  Sensor Networks","7 pages, 3 figures. Proceedings of FUSION 2018, Cambridge, UK",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an energy-efficient counting rule for distributed
detection by ordering sensor transmissions in wireless sensor networks. In the
counting rule-based detection in an $N-$sensor network, the local sensors
transmit binary decisions to the fusion center, where the number of all $N$
local-sensor detections are counted and compared to a threshold. In the
ordering scheme, sensors transmit their unquantized statistics to the fusion
center in a sequential manner; highly informative sensors enjoy higher priority
for transmission. When sufficient evidence is collected at the fusion center
for decision making, the transmissions from the sensors are stopped. The
ordering scheme achieves the same error probability as the optimum
unconstrained energy approach (which requires observations from all the $N$
sensors) with far fewer sensor transmissions. The scheme proposed in this paper
improves the energy efficiency of the counting rule detector by ordering the
sensor transmissions: each sensor transmits at a time inversely proportional to
a function of its observation. The resulting scheme combines the advantages
offered by the counting rule (efficient utilization of the network's
communication bandwidth, since the local decisions are transmitted in binary
form to the fusion center) and ordering sensor transmissions (bandwidth
efficiency, since the fusion center need not wait for all the $N$ sensors to
transmit their local decisions), thereby leading to significant energy savings.
As a concrete example, the problem of target detection in large-scale wireless
sensor networks is considered. Under certain conditions the ordering-based
counting rule scheme achieves the same detection performance as that of the
original counting rule detector with fewer than $N/2$ sensor transmissions; in
some cases, the savings in transmission approaches $(N-1)$.

cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Due to the
strong line-of-sight (LoS) air-to-ground (A2G) channels, the UAV may
impose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the cellular
base stations (BSs) than the ground users. To tackle this challenge, we propose
to apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to the uplink
communication from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the
existing ground users. However, for our considered system, traditional NOMA
with local interference cancellation (IC), termed non-cooperative NOMA, may
provide very limited gain compared to the OMA. This is because there are many
co-channel BSs due to the LoS A2G channels and thus the UAV's rate performance
is severely limited by the BS with the worst channel condition with the UAV. To
improve the UAV's achievable rate, a new cooperative NOMA scheme is proposed by
exploiting the backhaul links among BSs. Specifically, some BSs with better
channel conditions are selected to decode the UAV's signals first, and then
forward the decoded signals to their backhaul-connected BSs for IC. To
investigate the optimal design of cooperative NOMA, we maximize the weighted
sum-rate of the UAV and ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV's rate and
power allocations over multiple resource blocks. However, this problem is hard
to be solved optimally. To obtain useful insights, we first consider two
special cases with egoistic and altruistic transmission strategies of the UAV,
respectively, and solve their corresponding problems optimally. Next, we
consider the general case and propose an efficient suboptimal solution via the
alternating optimization. Numerical results show that the proposed cooperative
NOMA yields significant throughput gains than the OMA and the non-cooperative
NOMA benchmark.

3D motion of the person in the video using the template model, and subsequently
generate a synthetically rendered version of the video. These images are then

understanding and modelling data that takes distributional form (i.e. symbols),
such as random lists, intervals and histograms. It was developed under the
premise that the statistical unit of interest is the symbol, and that inference
is required at this level. Here we consider a different perspective, which
opens a new research direction in the field of SDA. We assume that, as with a
standard statistical analysis, inference is required at the level of
individual-level data. However, the individual-level data are aggregated into
symbols - group-based distributional-valued summaries - prior to the analysis.
In this way, large and complex datasets can be reduced to a smaller number of
distributional summaries, that may be analysed more efficiently than the
original dataset. As such, we develop SDA techniques as a new approach for the
analysis of big data. In particular we introduce a new general method for
constructing likelihood functions for symbolic data based on a desired
probability model for the underlying measurement-level data, while only
observing the distributional summaries. This approach opens the door for new
classes of symbol design and construction, in addition to developing SDA as a
viable tool to enable and improve upon classical data analyses, particularly
for very large and complex datasets. We illustrate this new direction for SDA
research through several real and simulated data analyses.

quantum case presents additional sources of uncertainty for the players. The
foremost among these is that players do not know if they have solved the
problem until they measure their quantum state. This question of `when to
measure?' presents a very interesting strategic problem. We develop a
game-theoretic model of a multiplayer quantum race, and find an approximate
Nash equilibrium where all players play the same strategy. In the two-party
case, we further show that this strategy is nearly optimal in terms of payoff
among all symmetric Nash equilibria. A key role in our analysis of quantum
races is played by a more tractable version of the game where there is no
payout on a tie; for such races we completely characterize the Nash equilibria
in the two-party case.
  One application of our results is to the stability of the Bitcoin protocol
when mining is done by quantum computers. Bitcoin mining is a race to solve a
computational search problem, with the winner gaining the right to create a new
block. Our results inform the strategies that eventual quantum miners should
use, and also indicate that the collision probability---the probability that
two miners find a new block at the same time---would not be too high in the
case of quantum miners. Such collisions are undesirable as they lead to forking
of the Bitcoin blockchain.

probability of the user clicks, has become one of the core tasks in advertising
systems. For CTR prediction model, it is necessary to capture the latent user
interest behind the user behavior data. Besides, considering the changing of
the external environment and the internal cognition, user interest evolves over
time dynamically. There are several CTR prediction methods for interest
modeling, while most of them regard the representation of behavior as the
interest directly, and lack specially modeling for latent interest behind the
concrete behavior. Moreover, few work consider the changing trend of interest.
In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Deep Interest Evolution
Network~(DIEN), for CTR prediction. Specifically, we design interest extractor
layer to capture temporal interests from history behavior sequence. At this
layer, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise interest extracting at each
step. As user interests are diverse, especially in the e-commerce system, we
propose interest evolving layer to capture interest evolving process that is
relative to the target item. At interest evolving layer, attention mechanism is
embedded into the sequential structure novelly, and the effects of relative
interests are strengthened during interest evolution. In the experiments on
both public and industrial datasets, DIEN significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions. Notably, DIEN has been deployed in the display
advertisement system of Taobao, and obtained 20.7\% improvement on CTR.

the degree to which synthetic pretraining outperforms ImageNet pretraining

whether each multiplet included in the theory is effectively massless in this

low-complexity signal detector for banded linear systems based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). We develop a novel CNN-based detector by utilizing the
banded structure of the channel matrix. Specifically, the proposed CNN-based
detector consists of three modules: the input preprocessing module, the CNN
module, and the output postprocessing module. With such an architecture, the
proposed CNN-based detector is adaptive to different system sizes, and can
overcome the curse of dimensionality, which is a ubiquitous challenge in deep
learning. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the
proposed CNN-based detector outperforms conventional deep neural networks and
existing model-based detectors in both accuracy and computational time.
Moreover, we show that CNN is flexible for systems with large sizes or wide
bands. We also show that the proposed CNN-based detector can be easily extended
to near-banded systems such as doubly selective orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) systems and 2-D magnetic recording (TDMR) systems, in which
the channel matrices do not have a strictly banded structure.

messages, because the data sparseness exhibited in short messages lacking
structure and contexts results in poor message-level word co-occurrence
patterns. To address this issue, we organize microblog messages as conversation
trees based on their reposting and replying relations, and propose an
unsupervised model that jointly learns word distributions to represent: 1)
different roles of conversational discourse, 2) various latent topics in
reflecting content information. By explicitly distinguishing the probabilities
of messages with varying discourse roles in containing topical words, our model
is able to discover clusters of discourse words that are indicative of topical
content. In an automatic evaluation on large-scale microblog corpora, our joint
model yields topics with better coherence scores than competitive topic models
from previous studies. Qualitative analysis on model outputs indicates that our
model induces meaningful representations for both discourse and topics. We
further present an empirical study on microblog summarization based on the
outputs of our joint model. The results show that the jointly modeled discourse
and topic representations can effectively indicate summary-worthy content in
microblog conversations.

amounts of data into a multi-hop network. Whisper makes use of synchronous
transmissions, a technique first introduced by the Glossy flooding protocol. In
contrast to Glossy, Whisper does not let the radio switch from receive to
transmit mode between messages. Instead, it makes nodes continuously transmit
identical copies of the message and eliminates the gaps between subsequent
transmissions. To this end, Whisper embeds the message to be flooded into a
signaling packet that is composed of multiple packlets -- where a packlet is a
portion of the message payload that mimics the structure of an actual packet. A
node must intercept only one of the packlets to detect that there is an ongoing
transmission and that it should start forwarding the message. This allows
Whisper to speed up the propagation of the flood, and thus, to reduce the
overall radio-on time of the nodes. Our evaluation on the FlockLab testbed
shows that Whisper achieves comparable reliability but 2x lower radio-on time
than Glossy. We further show that by embedding Whisper in an existing data
collection application, we can more than double the lifetime of the network.

credit assignment to events far back in the past. The most common method for
training recurrent neural networks, back-propagation through time (BPTT),
requires credit information to be propagated backwards through every single
step of the forward computation, potentially over thousands or millions of time
steps. This becomes computationally expensive or even infeasible when used with
long sequences. Importantly, biological brains are unlikely to perform such
detailed reverse replay over very long sequences of internal states (consider
days, months, or years.) However, humans are often reminded of past memories or
mental states which are associated with the current mental state. We consider
the hypothesis that such memory associations between past and present could be
used for credit assignment through arbitrarily long sequences, propagating the
credit assigned to the current state to the associated past state. Based on
this principle, we study a novel algorithm which only back-propagates through a
few of these temporal skip connections, realized by a learned attention
mechanism that associates current states with relevant past states. We
demonstrate in experiments that our method matches or outperforms regular BPTT
and truncated BPTT in tasks involving particularly long-term dependencies, but
without requiring the biologically implausible backward replay through the
whole history of states. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
transfers to longer sequences significantly better than LSTMs trained with BPTT
and LSTMs trained with full self-attention.

dust attenuation levels toward stellar light (from L(IR)/L(UV) ratio) and
nebular emission lines (from H-alpha/H-beta ratio). We find that there is a
clear trend that more massive galaxies tend to have higher ""extra"" attenuation
toward nebular regions, while galaxies with higher specific star formation
rates tend to have lower extra attenuation. We also confirm these trends by
using the WISE mid-infrared photometry with a significantly large sample size

levels of extra attenuation toward nebular regions change across the SFR-Mstar

main sequence tend to have higher levels of extra attenuation toward nebular

defined in the oversampling domain, which is larger than the target coarse
block. To get a good approximation space, the oversampling domain should be
large enough. We also propose a relaxed minimization problem to construct
multiscale basis functions, which will yield more accurate and robust solution.

Computing the exact bounds on a determinant of an interval matrix is an NP-hard
problem. Therefore, attention is first paid to approximations. NP-hardness of
both relative and absolute approximation is proved. Next, methods computing
verified enclosures of interval determinants and their possible combination
with preconditioning are discussed. A new method based on Cramer's rule was
designed. It returns similar results to the state-of-the-art method, however,
it is less consuming regarding computational time. As a byproduct, the
Gerschgorin circles were generalized for interval matrices. New results about
classes of interval matrices with polynomially computable tasks related to
determinant are proved (symmetric positive definite matrices, class of matrices
with identity midpoint matrix, tridiagonal H-matrices). The mentioned methods
were exhaustively compared for random general and symmetric matrices.

resolutions $\widetilde{X}\to X$, an effective cycle $Z$ supported on the
reduced exceptional curve, and any possible (first Chern) class $l'\in
H^2(\widetilde{X},\mathbb{Z})$. With these data we define the variety ${\rm
ECa}^{l'}(Z)$ of those effective Cartier divisors $D$ supported on $Z$ which
determine a line bundles $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)$ with first Chern class $l'$.
Furthermore, we consider the affine space ${\rm Pic}^{l'}(Z)\subset
H^1(\mathcal{O}_Z^*)$ of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles with
Chern class $l'$ and the Abel map $c^{l'}(Z):{\rm ECa}^{l'}(Z)\to {\rm
Pic}^{l'}(Z)$.
  The present manuscript develops the major properties of this map, and links
them with the determination of the cohomology groups $H^1(Z,\mathcal{L})$,
where we might vary the analytic structure $(X,o)$ (supported on a fixed
topological type/resolution graph) and we also vary the possible line bundles
${\mathcal{L}}\in {\rm Pic}^{l'}(Z)$. The case of generic line bundles of ${\rm
Pic}^{l'}(Z)$ and generic line bundles of the image of the Abel map will have
priority roles. Rewriting the Abel map via Laufer duality based on integration
of forms on divisors, we can make explicit the Abel map and its tangent map.
The case of superisolated and weighted homogeneous singularities are
exemplified with several details.
  The theory has similar goals (but rather different techniques) as the theory
of Abel map or Brill--Noether theory of reduced smooth projective curves.

making tasks. However, it is challenging to extend Q-learning to large-scale
multi-agent scenarios, due to the explosion of action space resulting from the
complex dynamics between the environment and the agents. In this paper, we
propose to make the computation of multi-agent Q-learning tractable by treating
the Q-function (w.r.t. state and joint-action) as a high-order high-dimensional
tensor and then approximate it with factorized pairwise interactions.
Furthermore, we utilize a composite deep neural network architecture for
computing the factorized Q-function, share the model parameters among all the
agents within the same group, and estimate the agents' optimal joint actions
through a coordinate descent type algorithm. All these simplifications greatly
reduce the model complexity and accelerate the learning process. Extensive
experiments on two different multi-agent problems demonstrate the performance
gain of our proposed approach in comparison with strong baselines, particularly
when there are a large number of agents.

  treatment effect in a subgroup characterized by post-randomization events","16 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The treatment effect in a specific subgroup is often of interest in
randomized clinical trials. When the subgroup is characterized by the absence
of certain post-randomization events, a naive analysis on the subset of
patients without these events may be misleading. The principal stratification
framework allows one to define an appropriate causal estimand in such settings.
Statistical inference for the principal stratum estimand hinges on
scientifically justified assumptions, which can be included with Bayesian
methods through prior distributions. Our motivating example is a large
randomized placebo-controlled trial of siponimod in patients with secondary
progressive multiple sclerosis. The primary objective of this trial was to
demonstrate the efficacy of siponimod relative to placebo in delaying
disability progression for the whole study population. However, the treatment
effect in the subgroup of patients who would not relapse during the trial is
relevant from both a scientific and regulatory perspective. Assessing this
subgroup treatment effect is challenging as there is strong evidence that
siponimod reduces relapses. Aligned with the draft regulatory guidance ICH
E9(R1), we describe in detail the scientific question of interest, the
principal stratum estimand, the corresponding analysis method for binary
endpoints and sensitivity analyses.

many heavily obscured Compton-thick AGN. In our previous work, we have
identified more than 50 candidate Compton-thick AGN in the local Universe,
corresponding to an observed fraction of about 7% of the total AGN population.
This number can be converted to the intrinsic Compton-thick AGN number density,
only if we know the form of the Compton-thick AGN spectrum, that is the energy
of their absorption turnover, photon-index and its cut-off energy at high
energies, as well as the strength of the reflection component on the matter
surrounding the nucleus. In order to constrain their number density, we analyse
the spectra of 19 Compton-thick AGN which have been detected with Swift/BAT and
have been subsequently observed with NuSTAR in the 3-80 keV band. We analyse
their X-ray spectra using the MYTORUS models of Murphy and Yaqoob which
properly take into account the Compton scattering effects. These are combined
with physically motivated Comptonisation models which accurately describe the
primary coronal X-ray emission. We derive absorbing column densities which are
consistent with those derived by the previous Swift/BAT analyses. We estimate
the coronal temperatures to be roughly between 25 and 80 keV corresponding to
high energy cut-offs roughly between 75 and 250 keV. We find that the majority
of our AGN lacks a strong reflection component in the 20-40 keV band placing
tighter constraints on the intrinsic Compton-thick AGN fraction. Combining
these results with our X-ray background synthesis models, we estimate a
Compton-thick AGN fraction in the local Universe of ~20 +/-3 % relative to the
type-II AGN population.

where the transmitter and receiver, both with directive antennas, are situated
in the same rectangular room. This scenario is known to produce channel impulse
responses with a gradual specular-to-diffused transition in delay. Mirror
source theory predicts the arrival rate to be quadratic in delay, inversely
proportional to room volume and proportional to the product of the antenna beam
coverage fractions. We approximate the mirror source positions by a homogeneous
spatial Poisson point process and their gain as complex random variables with
the same second moment. The multipath delays in the resulting model form an
inhomogeneous Poisson point process which enables derivation of the
characteristic functional, power/kurtosis delay spectra, and the distribution
of order statistics of the arrival delays in closed form. We find that the
proposed model matches the mirror source model well in terms of power delay
spectrum, kurtosis delay spectrum, order statistics, and prediction of mean
delay and rms delay spread. The constant rate model, assumed in e.g. the
Saleh-Valenzuela model, is unable to reproduce the same effects.

orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) in multi-user massive MIMO systems.
The beamformer is divided into two parts: a pre-beamforming matrix to separate
the users into different beams with no interference between each other, which
is designed based on the low rank covariance matrix of the downlink channel,
and a linear precoding matrix using partial or even no channel state
information (CSI) concatenated by an OSTBC. To construct the pre-beamforming
matrix, a simple method that selects columns from DFT matrix is presented. To
design the linear precoding matrix with partial CSI of the effective channel
after the pre-beamforming, we solve an optimization problem to minimize the
pairwise error probability (PEP) of the users under an individual power or sum
power constraint, respectively. For the individual power constraint, a
semi-definite relaxing (SDR) method with a sufficient condition achieving the
globally optimal solution is proposed to provide a performance benchmark. In
addition, an efficient iterative successive convex approximation (SCA) method
is provided to achieve a suboptimal solution. Furthermore, closed form
solutions are derived under some special cases. For the sum power constraint,
we consider two different designs, i.e., minimizing the average PEP and
minimizing the maximum PEP of all users. We find that both non-convex problems
have a similar structure, and proposed a unified SCA-Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to handle them. The SCA-ADMM method can
be implemented in a parallel manner, and thus is with great efficiency.
Simulation results show the efficiency of our proposed JSDD scheme and the
optimization method.

Reionization - promises to be an important source of information for the study
of the infant universe. However, its detection is impossible without sufficient
mitigation of other strong signals in the data, which requires an accurate
knowledge of the instrument. Using the result of instrument calibration, a
large part of the contaminating signals are removed and the resulting residual
data is further analyzed in order to detect the 21-cm signal. Direction
dependent calibration (DDC) can strongly affect the 21-cm signal, however, its
effect has not been precisely quantified.
  In the analysis presented here we show how to exactly calculate what part of
the 21-cm signal is removed as a result of the DDC. We also show how a-priori
information about the frequency behavior of the instrument can be used to
reduce signal suppression. The theoretical results are tested using a realistic
simulation based on the LOFAR setup. Our results show that low-order smooth
gain functions (e.g. polynomials) over a bandwidth of ~10\,MHz - over which the
signal is expected to be stationary - is sufficient to allow for calibration
with limited, quantifiable, signal suppression in its power spectrum. We also
show mathematically and in simulations that more incomplete sky models lead to
larger 21-cm signal suppression, even if the gain models are enforced to be
fully smooth. This result has immediate consequences for current and future
radio telescopes with non-identical station beams, where DDC might be necessary
(e.g. SKA-low).

recommendation, particularly for the cold start users. Due to the sparse nature

available. To infer the missing trust values, one well-known approach is path
based trust estimation, which suggests a user to believe all of its neighbors
in the network. In this context, we propose two threshold-based heuristics to
overcome the limitation of computation for the path based trust inference. It
uses the propagation phenomena of trust and decides a threshold value to select
a subset of users for trust propagation. While the first heuristic creates the
inferred network considering only the subset of users, the second one is able
to preserve the density of the inferred network coming from all users
selection. We implement the heuristics and analyze the inferred networks with
two real-world datasets. We observe that the proposed threshold based heuristic
can recover up to 70 \% of the paths with much less time compared to its
deterministic counterpart. We also show that the heuristic based inferred trust
is capable of preserving the recommendation accuracy.

study of the magnetic helicity content of heliospheric plasmas. Relative
magnetic helicity can be decomposed uniquely into two gauge invariant
quantities, the magnetic helicity of the non-potential component of the field,
and a complementary volume-threading helicity. Recent analysis of numerical
experiments simulating the generation of solar eruptions have shown that the
ratio of the non-potential helicity to the total relative helicity is a clear
marker of the eruptivity of the magnetic system, and that the high value of
that quantity could be a sufficient condition for the onset of the instability
generating the eruptions. The present study introduces the first analytical
examination of the time variations of these non-potential and volume-threading
helicities. The validity of the analytical formulas derived are confirmed with
analysis of three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of
solar coronal dynamics. Both the analytical investigation, and the numerical
application show that, unlike magnetic helicity, the non-potential and the
volume-threading helicities are not conserved quantities, even in the ideal MHD
regime. A term corresponding to the transformation between the non-potential
and volume-threading helicities frequently dominates their dynamics. This
finding has an important consequence for their estimation in the solar corona:
unlike with relative helicity, their volume coronal evolution cannot be
ascertained by the flux of these quantities through the volume's boundaries.
Only techniques extrapolating the 3D coronal field will enable both the proper
study of the non-potential and volume-threading helicities, and the
observational analysis of helicity-based solar-eruptivity proxies.

many different timescales. In particular, coronal holes exhibit temporal and
spatial variability. Signatures of these coronal dynamics are inherited by the
coronal hole wind streams that originate in these regions and can effect the
Earth's magnetosphere. Both the cause of the observed variabilities and how
these translate to fluctuations in the in situ observed solar wind is not yet
fully understood. During solar activity minimum the structure of the magnetic
field typically remains stable over several Carrington rotations (CRs). But how
stable is the solar magnetic field? Here, we address this question by analyzing
the evolution of a coronal hole structure and the corresponding coronal hole
wind stream emitted from this source region over 12 consecutive CRs in 2006. To
this end, we link in situ observations of Solar Wind Ion Composition
Spectrometer (SWICS) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) with
synoptic maps of Michelson Doppler imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) at the photospheric level through a combination of ballistic
back-mapping and a potential field source surface (PFSS) approach. Together,
these track the evolution of the open field line region that is identified as
the source region of a recurring coronal hole wind stream.
  We find that the shape of the open field line region and to some extent also
the solar wind properties are influenced by surrounding more dynamic closed
loop regions. We show that the freeze-in order can change within a coronal hole
wind stream on small timescales and illustrate a mechanism that can cause
changes in the freeze-in order. The inferred minimal temperature profile is
variable even within coronal hole wind and is in particular most variable in
the outer corona.

their collisional age as well as their respective O and C charge states and
analyzed their Fe charge-state distributions. Additionally, with a combination
of simple ballistic back-mapping and the potential field source surface model,
transitions between streams with high and low Fe charge states were mapped back
to the photosphere. The relative frequency of high and low Fe charge-state
streams is compared for the years 2004 and 2006. We found several otherwise
typical coronal-hole streams that include Fe charge states either as high as or
lower than in slow solar wind. Eight such transitions in 2006 were mapped back
to equatorial coronal holes that were either isolated or connected to the
northern coronal-hole. Attempts to identify coronal structures associated with
the transitions were so far inconclusive.

KW perspective a counter-propagating Rossby wave (CRW) is created at each PV
edge, i.e. the edge where a PV jump is located. The important parameters of our

deformation radius Ld, which indicates how far the pressure perturbations can
vertically propagate. While an adverse shear (m < 0) stabilizes the system, a
favorable shear (m > 0) strengthens the instability. This is due to how the
background shear affects the two uncoupled CRWs by shifting the optimal phase
difference towards large (small) wavenumber when m < 0 (m > 0). As the QG

between inertial and elastic stresses. Here, we explore the effect of inertia
on the stability of viscoelastic flow in a broad range of control parameters
$El$ and $(\mbox{Re}, \mbox{Wi})$. We present the stability diagram of observed

distinct regions in the diagram are identified based on $El$. Strikingly, for
high elasticity fluids we discover a complete relaminarization of flow at
Reynolds number of the order of unity, different from a well-known turbulent
drag reduction. These counterintuitive effects may be explained by a finite
polymer extensibility and a suppression of vorticity at high $\mbox{Wi}$. Our

segmentation is the internal covariate shift where the training of
convolutional kernels is encumbered by the distribution change of input
features, hence both the training speed and performance are decreased. Batch
Normalization (BN) is the first proposed method for addressing internal
covariate shift and is widely used. Instance Normalization (IN) and Layer
Normalization (LN) have also been proposed. Group Normalization (GN) is
proposed more recently and has not yet been applied to 2D biomedical semantic
segmentation, however, no specific validations on GN were given. Most DCNNs for
biomedical semantic segmentation adopt BN as the normalization method by
default, without reviewing its performance. In this paper, four normalization
methods - BN, IN, LN and GN are compared in details, specifically for 2D
biomedical semantic segmentation. U-Net is adopted as the basic DCNN structure.
Three datasets regarding the Right Ventricle (RV), aorta, and Left Ventricle

the feature map, i.e. GN with a large group number or IN, achieves higher
accuracy. This accuracy improvement mainly comes from better model
generalization. Codes are uploaded and maintained at Xiao-Yun Zhou's Github.

data for comet 45P from February 10 to March 30 after perihelion (r$_h$=0.53
au). We computed the production rates of the daughter species OH, NH, CN, C$_3$
and C$_2$ and we measured the dust proxy, Af$\rho$, for both comets. The peak
of water production rate of 41P was (3.46$\pm$0.20)$\times$10$^{27}$
molecules/s on April 3, 2017 when the comet was at 1.05 au from the Sun. We
have shown that the activity of 41P is decreasing by about 30% to 40% from one

(1.43$\pm$0.62)$\times$10$^{27}$ molecules/s during a month after perihelion.
Our results show that these Jupiter Family Comets had low gas and dust activity
and no outburst was detected. Relative abundances, expressed as ratios of
production rates and Af$\rho$ parameter with respect to OH and to CN, were
compared to those measured in other comets. We found that 41P and 45P have a
typical composition in term of carbon bearing species. The study of coma
features exhibited by the CN gas species allowed the measurement of the
rotation period of 41P, showing a surprisingly large increase of the rotation
period from (30$\pm$5) hrs at the end of March to (50$\pm$10) hrs at the end of
April, 2017 in agreement with recent observations by other teams.

graphon parameters with the property that their minimizers or maximizers
identify cut distance accumulation points over the set of weak* accumulation

  Of particular importance are cut distance identifying parameters coming from
homomorphism densities, $t(H,\cdot)$. This concept is closely related to the
emerging field of graph norms, and the notions of the step Sidorenko property
and the step forcing property introduced by Kr\'a\v{l}, Martins, Pach and
Wrochna [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 162 (2019), 34-54]. We prove that a connected
graph is weakly norming if and only if it is step Sidorenko, and that if a
graph is norming then it is step forcing.
  Further, we study convexity properties of cut distance identifying graphon
parameters, and find a way to identify cut distance limits using spectra of
graphons. We also show that continuous cut distance identifying graphon
parameters have the {\guillemotleft}pumping property{\guillemotright}, and thus

accurately describe the dispersion of the electronic bands near the band gap.
Our computed electronic mobility as a function of temperature and carrier
concentration is in good agreement with experiments. We show that longitudinal
optical phonon scattering dominates electronic transport in $n$-type PbTe,
while acoustic phonon scattering is relatively weak. We find that scattering
due to soft transverse optical phonons is by far the weakest scattering
mechanism, due to the symmetry-forbidden scattering between the conduction band
minima and the zone center soft modes. Soft phonons thus play the key role in
the high thermoelectric figure of merit of $n$-type PbTe: they do not degrade
its electronic transport properties although they strongly suppress the lattice
thermal conductivity. Our results suggest that materials like PbTe with soft
modes that are weakly coupled with the electronic states relevant for transport
may be promising candidates for efficient thermoelectric materials.

The spiral galaxy NGC 4388 underwent a ram pressure stripping event ~200 Myr
ago caused by its highly eccentric orbit within the Virgo cluster. This galaxy
fulfills all diagnostic criteria for having undergone active ram pressure
stripping in the recent past: a strongly truncated HI and Halpha disk, an
asymmetric ridge of polarized radio continuum emission, extended extraplanar
gas toward the opposite side of the ridge of polarized radio continuum
emission, and a recent (a few 100 Myr) quenching of the star formation activity
in the outer, gas-free galactic disk. We made dynamical simulations of the ram
pressure stripping event to investigate the influence of galactic structure on
the observed properties of NGC 4388. The combination of a deep optical spectrum
of the outer gas-free region of the galactic disk together with deep HI,
Halpha, FUV, and polarized radio continuum data permits to constrain numerical
simulations to derive the temporal ram pressure profile, the 3D velocity vector
of the galaxy, and the time since peak ram pressure with a high level of
confidence. From the simulations an angle between the ram pressure wind and the
galactic disk of 30 degrees is derived. The galaxy underwent peak ram pressure
~240 Myr ago. The observed asymmetries in the disk of NGC 4388 are not caused
by the present action of ram pressure, but by the resettling of gas that has
been pushed out of the galactic disk during the ram pressure stripping event.
For the detailed reproduction of multi-wavelength observations of a spiral
galaxy that undergoes or underwent a ram pressure stripping event, galactic
structure, i.e. spiral arms, has to be taken into account.

[1-4] show that there exist the so-called open string pair production for a
possible simplest system of two Dp branes, placed parallel at a separation and
with each carrying different electric flux, in Type II superstring theories.
Further this pair production can be greatly enhanced when a magnetic flux,
sharing no common field strength index with the electric one, is added,
implying then $p \ge 3$. Given this, one may wonder if further enhancement can
be achieved by adding more magnetic flux(es) in a similar fashion. In this
paper, we explore this possibility. It turns out that adding more such magnetic
flux diminishes rather than enhances the pair production rate. This actually
implies that the largest enhancement occurs at $p = 3$ when the same realistic
electric and magnetic fluxes are applied for all $p \ge 3$. Curiously one of D3
branes may be our own world and if so, the enhancement gives a possible
opportunity to detect the pair production, therefore to test the underlying
string theories.

equations, plays an incredibly important role in several problems in science

Galerkin (DG) method is one of the better ways of delivering high accuracy in
CED. Maxwell's equations have a pair of involution constraints for which
mimetic schemes that globally satisfy the constraints at a discrete level are
highly desirable. Balsara and Kappeli presented a von Neumann stability
analysis of globally constraint-preserving DG schemes for CED up to 4'th order
which was focused on developing the theory and documenting the superior
dissipation and dispersion of DGTD schemes in media with constant permittivity
and permeability. In this paper we present DGTD schemes for CED that go up to
5'th order of accuracy and analyze their performance when permittivity and
permeability vary strongly in space. Our DGTD schemes achieve constraint
preservation by collocating the electric displacement and magnetic induction as
well as their higher order modes in the faces of the mesh. Our first finding is
that at 4'th and higher orders, one has to evolve some zone-centered modes in
addition to the face-centered modes. It is well-known that the limiting step in
DG schemes causes a reduction of the optimal accuracy of the scheme. In this
paper we document simulations where permittivity and permeability vary by
almost an order of magnitude without requiring any limiting of the DG scheme.
This very favorable finding ensures that DGTD schemes retain optimal accuracy
even in the presence of large spatial variations in permittivity/permeability.
Our third finding shows that the electromagnetic energy is conserved very well
even when permittivity and permeability vary strongly in space; as long as the
conductivity is zero.

multiples of the Kolmogorov length scale in the presence of forced turbulence
and gravity, resorting to interface-resolved DNS based on an IBM. The values of
the particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number (180) are such
that strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of
turbulence. The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale
Reynolds number 95 and 140) would lead to mild levels of clustering in the
absence of gravity. Here we detect a tendency to cluster with an intensity
which is intermediate between these two limiting cases, meaning that forced
background turbulence decreases the level of clustering otherwise observed
under ambient settling. However, the clustering strength does not monotonously
decay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various mechanisms by which
coherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed. It is argued that
the reduced interaction time due to particle settling through the surrounding
eddy (crossing trajectories) has the effect of shifting upwards the range of
eddies with a time scale matching the characteristic time scale of the
particle. In the present cases this shift might bring the particles into
resonance with the energetic eddies of the turbulent spectrum. Concerning the
average particle settling velocity we find very small deviations from the value
obtained for an isolated particle in ambient fluid when defining the relative
velocity as an apparent slip velocity (i.e. as the difference between the
averages computed separately for the velocities of each phase). This is
consistent with simple estimates of the non-linear drag effect. However, the
relative velocity based upon the fluid velocity seen by each particle has on
average a smaller magnitude (by 5-7%) than the ambient single-particle value.

an existing vasculature in order to supply nutrients and/or metabolites to
tissues, playing a fundamental role in many physiological and pathological
conditions such as embryogenesis and tissue repair or tumour growth. Here we
analysed the \textit{in-vitro} angiogenic process from the perspective of the
monolayer to understand the role of the interaction between the surrounding
endothelial monolayer, the sprouting and the mechanics. First we noticed that
the VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) promotes a jamming/unjamming
transition that allows the fluidisation of the monolayer by measuring the shape
index factor. Next, we measured the density field over the monolayer and
realised that the flow of cells manifests strong similarities with the
evacuation process where the flock of cells can flow or stuck, defining a
convergent channel. Based on these novel observations we propose a mathematical
model to describe the effects of unjamming and reorientation of a flock of
cells which flow from the monolayer towards the early capillary structure. This

more strongly sedimenting colloidal suspensions of hard spheres nucleate much
faster than weakly sedimenting systems. In this work we consider firstly the
effect of sedimentation on the structure of colloidal hard spheres, by tuning
the density mismatch between solvent and colloidal particles. In particular we
investigate the effect on the degree of five fold symmetry present. Secondly we
study the size of density fluctuations in these experimental systems in
comparison to simulations. The density fluctuations are measured by assigning
each particle a local density, which is related to the number of particles
within a distance of 3.25 particle diameters. The standard deviation of these
local densities gives an indication of the fluctuations present in the system.
Five fold symmetry is suppressed by a factor of two when sedimentation is
induced in our system. Density fluctuations are also increased by a factor of
two in experiments compared to simulations. The change in five fold symmetry
makes a difference to the expected nucleation rates, but we demonstrate that it
is ultimately too small to resolve the discrepancy between experiment and
simulation, while the fluctuations are shown to be an artefact of 3d particle
tracking.

quantum eigensolver has been suggested as a systematic way to go beyond the
mean-field approximation and include electron correlation in solving quantum
chemistry problems on a quantum computer. Although being exact in the limit of
including all possible coupled-cluster excitations, practically, the accuracy
of this approach depends on how many and what kind of terms are included in the
wavefunction parametrization. Another difficulty of UCC is a growth of the
number of simultaneously entangled qubits even at the fixed fermionic
excitation rank. Not all quantum computing architectures can cope with this
growth. To address both problems we introduce a qubit coupled-cluster (QCC)
method that starts directly in the qubit space and uses energy response
estimates for ranking the importance of individual entanglers for the
variational energy minimization. Also, we provide an exact factorization of a
unitary rotation of more than two qubits to a product of two-qubit unitary
rotations. Thus, the QCC method with the factorization technique can be limited
to only two-qubit entanglement gates and allows for very efficient use of
quantum resources in terms of the number of coupled-cluster operators. The
method performance is illustrated by calculating ground-state potential energy
curves of H$_2$ and LiH molecules with chemical accuracy, $\le 1$ kcal/mol.

precipitation cell tracking algorithm which records the merging and
fragmentation of convective cells during their life cycles, and apply it on
large eddy simulation (LES) data. Conditioning on the area covered by each
cell, our algorithm is capable of analyzing an arbitrary number of auxiliary
fields, such as the anomalies of temperature and moisture, convective available
potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN). For tracks that do not
merge or split (termed ""solitary""), many of these quantities show generic,
often nearly linear relations that hardly depend on the forcing conditions of
the simulations, such as surface temperature. This finding allows us to propose
a highly idealized model of rain events, where the surface precipitation area
is circular and a cell's precipitation intensity falls off linearly with the
distance from the respective cell center. The drop-off gradient is nearly
independent of track duration and cell size, which allows for a generic
description of such solitary tracks, with the only remaining parameter the peak
intensity. In contrast to the simple and robust behavior of solitary tracks,
tracks that result from merging of two or more cells show a much more
complicated behavior. The most intense, long lasting and largest tracks indeed
stem from multi-mergers - tracks involved in repeated merging. Another
interesting finding is that the precipitation intensity of tracks does not
strongly depend on the absolute amount of local initial CAPE, which is only
partially consumed by most rain events. Rather, our results speak to boundary
layer cooling, induced by rain re-evaporation, as the cause for CAPE reduction,
CIN increase and shutdown of precipitation cells.

appears a second conserved Noether current in the interaction between two

wireless communication allows the spatial degrees of freedom in rich scattering

first revisit the derivation of the optimum antenna separation at the transmit

Although only the solution corresponding to the smallest antenna separation

understand this coupling, known as Brunel mechanism, is expected to be valid
only for very steep plasma surfaces. Despite innumerable studies, its validity
range remains uncertain, and the physics involved for smoother plasma-vacuum

the first comprehensive experimental and numerical study of the laser-plasma
coupling mechanisms as a function of the plasma interface steepness, in the
relativistic interaction regime. Our results reveal a clear transition from the
temporally-periodic Brunel mechanism to a chaotic dynamic associated to
stochastic heating. By revealing the key signatures of these two distinct

  fingerprint examination proposed based on the 2014 Miami Dade Police
  Department study",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the past decade, several studies have been conducted to estimate the
false positive error rate (FPR) associated with latent fingerprint examination.
The so-called Black-box study by Ulery et al. is regularly used to support the
claim that the FPR in fingerprint examination is reasonably low (0.1%). The
Ulery et al.'s estimate of the FPR is supported by the results of the extensive
study of the overall fingerprint examination process by Langenburg. In 2014,
the Miami Dade Police Department (MDPD) Forensic Services Bureau conducted
research to study the false positive error rate associated with latent
fingerprint examination. They report that approximately 3.0% of latent
fingerprint examinations result in a false positive conclusion. Their estimate
of the FPR becomes as high as 4.2% when inconclusive decisions are excluded
from the calculation. In their 2016 report, the President's Council of Advisors
on Science and Technology (PCAST) proposes that the MDPD FPR estimate be used
to inform jurors that errors occur at a detectable rate in fingerprint
examination; more specifically, they declare that false positives may occur as
often as 1 in 18 cases. The large discrepancy between the FPR estimates
reported by Ulery et al. and Langenburg on the one hand, and the MDPD on the
other hand, causes a great deal of controversy. In this paper, we review the
MDPD study and the various error rate calculations that have been proposed to
interpret its data. To assess the appropriateness of the different proposed
estimates, we develop a model that re-creates the MDPD study. This model allows
us to estimate the expected number of false positive conclusions that should be
obtained with any proposed FPR and compare this number to the actual number of
erroneous identifications observed by MDPD.

the quantitative properties of the dynamics driving the pulsations of the star.
The secondary, long-term light variation, i.e., the RVb phenomenon was removed

revealed that the pulsation of DF Cyg could be described as a chaotic signal
with a Lyapunov dimension of ~2.8. DF Cyg is only the third RV Tau star, and
the first of the RVb subtype, where the nonlinear analysis indicates that
low-dimensional chaos may explain the peculiarities of the pulsation.

important role in future traffic. To avoid accidents and achieve a highly
efficient traffic flow, it is important to detect VRUs and to predict their
intentions. In this article a holistic approach for detecting intentions of
VRUs by cooperative methods is presented. The intention detection consists of
basic movement primitive prediction, e.g. standing, moving, turning, and a
forecast of the future trajectory. Vehicles equipped with sensors, data
processing systems and communication abilities, referred to as intelligent
vehicles, acquire and maintain a local model of their surrounding traffic
environment, e.g. crossing cyclists. Heterogeneous, open sets of agents
(cooperating and interacting vehicles, infrastructure, e.g. cameras and laser
scanners, and VRUs equipped with smart devices and body-worn sensors) exchange
information forming a multi-modal sensor system with the goal to reliably and
robustly detect VRUs and their intentions under consideration of real time
requirements and uncertainties. The resulting model allows to extend the
perceptual horizon of the individual agent beyond their own sensory
capabilities, enabling a longer forecast horizon. Concealments,
implausibilities and inconsistencies are resolved by the collective
intelligence of cooperating agents. Novel techniques of signal processing and
modelling in combination with analytical and learning based approaches of
pattern and activity recognition are used for detection, as well as intention
prediction of VRUs. Cooperation, by means of probabilistic sensor and knowledge
fusion, takes place on the level of perception and intention recognition. Based
on the requirements of the cooperative approach for the communication a new
strategy for an ad hoc network is proposed.

simulating the delivery of the plan using measured delivery parameters to
distribute the plan amongst 4DCT phases characterizing the patient breathing,
using an in-house Monte Carlo simulation (MC) dose calculator to determine the
dose delivered to each breathing phase, and accumulating the doses from the
various breathing phases onto a single phase for evaluation. The accumulation

dynamical studies. In the present work, we analyze the title reaction within
the temperature range of 20 $-$ 100 K by means of ring polymer molecular
dynamics (RPMD) and quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) methods over the
full-dimensional global potential energy surface developed by Aguado et al. [A.
Aguado, O. Roncero, C. Tablero, C. Sanz, and M. Paniagua, J. Chem. Phys., 2000,
112, 1240]. The computed thermal RPMD and QCT rate coefficients are found to be
almost independent of temperature and fall within the range of 1.34 $-$
2.01$\times$10$^{-9}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$. They are also in a very good agreement
with the previous time-independent quantum mechanical and statistical quantum
method calculations. Furthermore, we observe that the choice of asymptotic
separation distance between the reactants can markedly alter the rate
coefficient in the low temperature regime (20 $-$ 50 K). Therefore it is of
utmost importance to correctly assign the value of this parameter for dynamical
studies, particularly at very low temperatures of astrochemical importance. We
finally conclude that experimental rate measurements for the title reaction are
highly desirable in future.

overwhelming number of patients worldwide, many of whom prove resistant to
medication. The efficacy of current innovative technologies for the treatment
of these patients has been stalled by the lack of accurate and effective
methods to fuse multimodal neuroimaging data to map anatomical targets driving
seizure dynamics. Here we propose a parsimonious model that explains how
large-scale anatomical networks and shared genetic constraints shape
inter-regional communication in focal epilepsy. In extensive ECoG recordings
acquired from a group of patients with medically refractory focal-onset
epilepsy, we find that ictal and preictal functional brain network dynamics can
be accurately predicted from features of brain anatomy and geometry, patterns
of white matter connectivity, and constraints complicit in patterns of gene
coexpression, all of which are conserved across healthy adult populations.
Moreover, we uncover evidence that markers of non-conserved architecture,
potentially driven by idiosyncratic pathology of single subjects, are most
prevalent in high frequency ictal dynamics and low frequency preictal dynamics.
Finally, we find that ictal dynamics are better predicted by white matter
features and more poorly predicted by geometry and genetic constraints than
preictal dynamics, suggesting that the functional brain network dynamics
manifest in seizures rely on - and may directly propagate along - underlying
white matter structure that is largely conserved across humans. Broadly, our
work offers insights into the generic architectural principles of the human
brain that impact seizure dynamics, and could be extended to further our
understanding, models, and predictions of subject-level pathology and response
to intervention.

problem is motivated by recent development of fast operation of CHP plants to
provide ancillary services of power system on the order of tens of seconds to
minutes. Due to the physical constraint that the responses of the heat
subsystem are not necessary as fast as those of the electric subsystem, the
target controlled state is not represented by any isolated equilibrium point,
implying that stability of the system is lost in the long-term sense on the
order of hours. In this paper, we first prove in the context of nonlinear
control theory that the state-space model of the two-site system is non-minimum
phase due to nonexistence of isolated equilibrium points of the associated zero
dynamics.Instead, we locate a one-dimensional invariant manifold that
represents the target controlled flows completely. Then, by utilizing a virtual
output under which the state-space model becomes minimum phase, we synthesize a
controller that achieves not only the regulation of energy flows in the
short-term regime but also stabilization of an equilibrium point in the
long-term regime. Effectiveness of the synthesized controller is established
with numerical simulations with a practical set of model parameters.

multiple loading situations, the paper shows that qualified starting guesses,
based on knowledge of optimal rank-3 laminates, significantly improves chances
of convergence to near optimal designs. Rank-3 laminates, optimal for a given
set of anisotropic loading conditions, are approximated on a single scale using
a simple mapping approach. We demonstrate that these mapped microstructures
perform relatively close to theoretical energy bounds. Microstructures with
performance even closer to the bounds can be obtained by using the approximated
rank-3 structures in a further step as starting guesses for inverse
homogenization problems. Due to the non-convex nature of inverse homogenization
problems, the starting guesses based on rank-3 laminates outperform classical
starting guesses with homogeneous or random material distributions.
Furthermore, the obtained single-scale microstructures are relatively simple,
which enhances manufacturability. Results, obtained for a wide range of loading
cases, indicate that microstructures with performance within 5-8% of the
theoretical optima can be guarantied, as long as feature sizes are not limited

plate models, where the structure is composed by a central beam moving
vertically and by a continuum of cross-sections free to rotate around the beam
and allowed to deflect from the horizontal equilibrium position. The torsional
instability of the structure is investigated, taking into account the impact of
different nonlinear terms aiming at modeling the action of cables and hangers
in a suspension bridge. Again, the optimal position of the piers in terms of
stability is discussed. The stability analysis is carried out both by means of

open problems and possible future developments are presented.

Historically, ICTV (sub)committees have classified viruses on the basis of
morphological characteristics and various other attributes. Today, virtually
all new viral genomes are assembled from metagenomic datasets and are not
linked directly to biological agents. Thus, placing a virus into a taxonomic
scheme solely from primary genome structure is an increasingly important
problem. Various simple descriptive statistics of a viral genome sequence have
been used successfully for virus classification. Here, we use the NCBI's viral
and viroid reference sequence collection (RefSeq) and a common experimental
framework to compare the performance of different genome sequence-derived
features and classifiers in the task of assigning a virus to one of seven ICTV
Orders. The nucleotide-, word-, and compression-based features we consider
include genome length, the k-mer Natural Vector (k = 1, ..., 6) and its
derivatives, return time distribution, and general-purpose and DNA-specific
compression ratios; the classifiers used are the k-NN and SVM. The combination
of genome length and k-NN has the worst, yet still respectable, performance
(mean error rate of 0.137); the best performance is achieved using 4-mer counts
and SVM (mean error rate of 0.006). We investigate the main causes of
misclassification, explore which viruses are more difficult to classify, and
use the best performing combination to predict the Orders of 1,834 unclassified
viruses. A subsequent version of RefSeq assigned Orders to 17 of these
previously unlabelled viruses. Since 16 of our predictions match these
assignments, our approach could aid virologists dealing with viruses that are

extend this analysis to a more complicated reaction mechanism, the auxiliary
enzyme reaction, in which a substrate is converted to product in two sequential

relevant timescales, several dynamic regimes can emerge. In addition to the

of scalar fields on a classical de Sitter geometry. We formulate the problem in
the framework of the Wilsonian renormalisation group, which allows us to treat
the scalar field fluctuations in a nonperturbative manner and to follow the
renormalisation flow of the spacetime curvature as long wavelength,
superhorizon fluctuations are progressively integrated out. For light fields in
units of the spacetime curvature, these are described by an effective
zero-dimensional field theory and can essentially be computed analytically. A
nontrivial flow of the spacetime curvature is induced either by a nonminimal
coupling to gravity or by self-interactions. The latter leads to a decrease of
the spacetime curvature through loop effects, which, for minimally coupled,
massless fields, grow unbounded in the infrared. However, such large loop
contributions are eventually screened by the dynamical generation of a
nonperturbative, gravitationally induced mass and the renormalisation of the
spacetime curvature saturates to a nonzero value. Finally, we show that, in the
case of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, the Goldstone modes do not
contribute to the infrared flow of the spacetime curvature, despite being
strongly amplified by the gravitational field.

contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart
contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in
law, business, commerce, and governance.
  Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as
Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for
deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously
executed, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine. As with all programs,
smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient
programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy
compilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often
commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need
security frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential
security vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum
smart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts
low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations.
Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion:
a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the
\souffle language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common
smart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and
efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing
over 95\% of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds;
outperforming the current state of the art tools---Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and
Rattle---under equivalent conditions.

similar best-fit cosmologies. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to show that, in
fact, this range in exponent values is exactly as expected in $\Lambda CDM$

consistent with their sampling of the $\Omega_m-H_0$ degeneracy and do not show

difficult due to the rapidly changing nature of the absorbing medium. This data
is also of vital importance to process modelers whose complex simulations need
reliable, accurate input data; yet, there is very little available. In this

most widely validated pharmacogenetic algorithm is the IWPC algorithm based on
multivariate linear regression (MLR). However, with only a single algorithm,
the prediction performance may reach an upper limit even with optimal
parameters. Here, we present novel algorithms using stacked generalization
frameworks to estimate the warfarin dose, within which different types of
machine learning algorithms function together through a meta-machine learning
model to maximize the prediction accuracy. Compared to the IWPC-derived MLR
algorithm, Stack 1 and 2 based on stacked generalization frameworks performed
significantly better overall. Subgroup analysis revealed that the mean of the
percentage of patients whose predicted dose of warfarin within 20% of the
actual stable therapeutic dose (mean percentage within 20%) for Stack 1 was

comparison of the absolute PL relations obeyed by classical Cepheids in the

metallicity difference among the Cepheid populations in these three galaxies,
we want to establish a possible systematic trend of the PL relation absolute
zero point as a function of metallicity, and determine the size of such an
effect in optical and near-infrared photometric bands. We are using the IRSB
Baade-Wesselink type method as calibrated by Storm et al. to determine
individual distances to the Cepheids in our samples in MW, LMC and SMC. For our
analysis, we use a greatly enhanced sample of Cepheids in the SMC (31 stars) as
compared to the small sample (5 stars) available in our previous work. We use
the distances to determine absolute Cepheid PL relations in optical and
near-infrared bands in each of the three galaxies.} {Our distance analysis of
31 SMC Cepheids with periods from 4-69 days yields tight PL relations in all
studied bands, with slopes consistent with the corresponding LMC and MW
relations. Adopting the very accurately determined LMC slopes for the optical
and near-infrared bands, we determine the zero point offsets between the
corresponding absolute PL relations in the 3 galaxies. We find that in all
bands the metal-poor SMC Cepheids are intrinsically fainter than their more
metal-rich counterparts in the LMC and MW. In the $K$ band the metallicity
effect is $-0.23\pm0.06$~mag/dex while in the $V,(V-I)$ Wesenheit index it is
slightly stronger, $-0.34\pm0.06$~mag/dex. We find some evidence that the PL

graph-based applications, such as graph similarity search, graph database

between two graphs is typically NP-hard, a series of approximate methods have
been proposed with a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Recently, several
data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been proposed, most of
which model the graph-graph similarity as the inner product of their
graph-level representations, with different techniques proposed for generating
one embedding per graph. However, using one fixed-dimensional embedding per
graph may fail to fully capture graphs in varying sizes and link structures, a
limitation that is especially problematic for the task of graph similarity
computation, where the goal is to find the fine-grained difference between two
graphs. In this paper, we address the problem of graph similarity computation
from another perspective, by directly matching two sets of node embeddings
without the need to use fixed-dimensional vectors to represent whole graphs for
their similarity computation. The model, GraphSim, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on four real-world graph datasets under six out of

very limit. Many of the existing validation techniques are domain-dependent

present an empirical learning-based validation procedure to implement a

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then introduced. In order to make full use

ordinary differential equations, which are piecewise smooth, but switch between
different states according to a Markov jump process. In the fast switching
limit, the dynamics converges to a deterministic ODE. In this paper we suppose
that this limit ODE supports a stable limit cycle. We demonstrate that a set of
such oscillators can synchronize when they are uncoupled, but they share the
same switching Markov jump process. The latter is taken to represent the effect
of a common randomly switching environment. We determine the leading order of
the Lyapunov coefficient governing the rate of decay of the phase difference in
the fast switching limit. The analysis bears some similarities to the classical
analysis of synchronization of stochastic oscillators subject to common white
noise. However the discrete nature of the Markov jump process raises some
difficulties: in fact we find that the Lyapunov coefficient from the
quasi-steady-state approximation differs from the Lyapunov coefficient one
obtains from a second order perturbation expansion in the waiting time between
jumps. Finally, we demonstrate synchronization numerically in the radial
isochron clock model and show that the latter Lyapinov exponent is more

theoretical treatment of these systems, exposing a duality allowing the Bethe
equations to be solved numerically. This is extended to the calculation of
inner products and correlation functions. Using this framework, the influence
of particle exchange on the Bethe ansatz is discussed, after which it is shown
how the Bethe ansatz is able to accurately model wave functions of
non-integrable models in two different settings. First, a variational approach
is outlined for stationary models where integrability-breaking perturbations
are explicitly introduced. Second, an alternative way of breaking integrability
is through the introduction of dynamics and periodic driving, where it is shown
how integrability can be used to model the resulting Floquet many-body
resonances. Throughout this work, it is shown how the clear-cut structure and
relatively large freedom in Richardson-Gaudin models makes them ideal for an
investigation of the general principles of integrability, as well as being a
perfect testing ground for the development of new quantum many-body techniques

include the modelling of susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) epidemics on
regular networks and extensions to SIS dynamics and contact tracing on more
exotic networks exhibiting degree heterogeneity, directed and/or weighted links
and clustering. However, extra features of the disease dynamics or of the
network lead to an increase in system size and analytical tractability becomes
problematic. Various `closures' can be used to keep the system tractable.
Focusing on SIR epidemics on regular but clustered networks, we show that even
for the most complex closure we can determine the epidemic threshold as an
asymptotic expansion in terms of the clustering coefficient.We do this by
exploiting the presence of a system of fast variables, specified by the
correlation structure of the epidemic, whose steady state determines the
epidemic threshold. While we do not find the steady state analytically, we
create an elegant asymptotic expansion of it. We validate this new threshold by
comparing it to the numerical solution of the full system and find excellent
agreement over a wide range of values of the clustering coefficient,
transmission rate and average degree of the network. The technique carries over
to pairwise models with other closures [1] and we note that the epidemic
threshold will be model dependent. This emphasises the importance of model
choice when dealing with realistic outbreaks.

that the members of the field-source siblings are subjects of an invariance
group that can transform them into each other. (This includes, the conservation
of the isotopic field-charge spin, proven in previous publications.) The paper
identifies the algebra of that transformation and characterises the group of
the invariance, it discusses the properties of this group, shows how they can
be classified in the known nomenclature, and why is this pseudo-unitary group
isomorphic with the SU(2) group. This algebra is denoted by tau. The invariance
group generated by the tau algebra is called hypersymmetry (HySy). The group of
HySy had not been described. The defined symmetry group is able to make
correspondence between scalars and vector components that appear often coupled

previous papers, the second part (Sec. 3 and 4) shows that the equations
describing the individual fundamental physical interacions are invariant under
the combined application of the Lorentz transformation and the here explored

lower energies). As illustration, the paper presents a simple form for an
extended Dirac equation and a set of matrices to describe the combined

learning from data in a variety of applications in Science and Engineering.
Traditionally, the input to these networks lie in a vector space and the
operations employed within the network are well defined on vector-spaces. In
the recent past, due to technological advances in sensing, it has become
possible to acquire manifold-valued data sets either directly or indirectly.
Examples include but are not limited to data from omnidirectional cameras on
automobiles, drones etc., synthetic aperture radar imaging, diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging, elastography and conductance imaging in the Medical Imaging
domain and others. Thus, there is need to generalize the deep neural networks
to cope with input data that reside on curved manifolds where vector space
operations are not naturally admissible. In this paper, we present a novel
theoretical framework to generalize the widely popular convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to high dimensional manifold-valued data inputs. We call these
networks, ManifoldNets.
  In ManifoldNets, convolution operation on data residing on Riemannian
manifolds is achieved via a provably convergent recursive computation of the
weighted Fr\'{e}chet Mean (wFM) of the given data, where the weights makeup the
convolution mask, to be learned. Further, we prove that the proposed wFM layer
achieves a contraction mapping and hence ManifoldNet does not need the
non-linear ReLU unit used in standard CNNs. We present experiments, using the
ManifoldNet framework, to achieve dimensionality reduction by computing the
principal linear subspaces that naturally reside on a Grassmannian. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ManifoldNets in the context of
classification and reconstruction accuracy.

(CDDN) framework to deal with visual relationship detection. To capture the
interactions of different object instances, two types of graphs, word semantic

interdependency. The semantic graph is built through language priors to model
semantic correlations across objects, whilst the visual scene graph defines the
connections of scene objects so as to utilize the surrounding scene

adaptively aggregate information from contexts, which can effectively learn
latent representations of visual relationships and well cater to visual
relationship detection in view of its isomorphic invariance to graphs.
Experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is

a given multislice CT dataset, one slice is selected automatically to form

in a better way. Masks are created from selected reference slice using
automatic seed point selection and region growing technique. One mask is
designed for brain matter and another includes the skull of the reference
slice. This second mask is used as global reference mask for all slices whereas
the brain matter mask is implemented on only adjacent slices and continuously
modified for better segmentation. Slices in given dataset are divided into two
batches, before reference slice and after reference slice. Each batch segmented
separately. Successive propagation of brain matter mask has demonstrated very
high potential in reported segmentation. Presented result shows highest

masses (considered as isotopic field-charge (IFC)siblings of the gravitational

shows that their equivalence does not mean identity. Introduction of
qualitatively different mass terms modifies (among others) the gravitational
equation. That leads to apparently losing its symmetry. In order to keep the
symmetry of the stress-energy tensor, then, the paper identifies a symmetry
group by the help of the tau algebra, which is isomorphic with the SU(2) group.
The tau algebra transforms 3+1 type quantities. Invariance under the
transformations of this group is called hypersymmetry (HySy). The group of HySy
can make a correspondence between vector components and scalars. Next, there is
shown how does the HySy group restore the apparently distorted symmetry of the
stress-energy tensor. Finally, HySy is applied to the gravitational theory, and
there are discussed a few consequences for the gravitational equation in
quantum gravity. They are based on the, earlier disclosed, conservation of a
property of the IFC-s, called isotopic field-charge spin (IFCS). It is shown
that the solutions of the equations should be doubled, and another mediating
boson, called dion, is to be assumed in the gravitational interaction,
(anti)parallel with the graviton.

learning, which can be naturally enforced by training the model to refine a
single set of multidimensional embeddings $\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and decode them
into multiple outputs by connecting MLPs at the end of the pipeline. We
demonstrate the multitask learning capability of the model in the relevant
relational problem of estimating network centrality measures, focusing
primarily on producing rankings based on these measures, i.e. is vertex $v_1$
more central than vertex $v_2$ given centrality $c$?. We then show that a GNN
can be trained to develop a \emph{lingua franca} of vertex embeddings from
which all relevant information about any of the trained centrality measures can
be decoded. The proposed model achieves $89\%$ accuracy on a test dataset of
random instances with up to 128 vertices and is shown to generalise to larger
problem sizes. The model is also shown to obtain reasonable accuracy on a
dataset of real world instances with up to 4k vertices, vastly surpassing the
