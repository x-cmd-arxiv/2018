Recently, deep learning methods have led to significant progress, but such
methods are limited by the available training data. Current datasets based on
3D sensors have key limitations, including indoor-only images (NYU), small
numbers of training examples (Make3D), and sparse sampling (KITTI). We propose
to use multi-view Internet photo collections, a virtually unlimited data

multi-view stereo (MVS) methods, and present a large depth dataset called
MegaDepth based on this idea. Data derived from MVS comes with its own
challenges, including noise and unreconstructable objects. We address these
challenges with new data cleaning methods, as well as automatically augmenting
our data with ordinal depth relations generated using semantic segmentation. We
validate the use of large amounts of Internet data by showing that models
trained on MegaDepth exhibit strong generalization-not only to novel scenes,
but also to other diverse datasets including Make3D, KITTI, and DIW, even when
no images from those datasets are seen during training.

close to each other (the separation being smaller than the addition of the
widths of the flows) and with large opening angles, the collision seems
unavoidable regardless of the orientation of the outflows. This is in contrast
to the current observational evidence of just a few regions with indications of
colliding outflows. Here, using sensitive observations of the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report resolved images of carbon
monoxide (CO) towards the binary flows associated with the BHR71 protostellar
system. These images reveal for the first time solid evidence that their flows
are partially colliding, increasing the brightness of the CO, the dispersion of
the velocities in the interaction zone, and changing part of the orientation in
one of the flows. Additionally, this impact opened the possibility of knowing
the 3D geometry of the system, revealing that one of its components (IRS2)
should be closer to us.

an ultra low doping density $\sim 10^{11}$cm${}^{-2}$ has alerted the community
to look for an electron-electron interaction based mechanism, as phonon-induced
attraction seems inadequate. We suggest a mechanism of superconductivity, where
an important role is played by the dense (density $\approx$ 2 $\times$
10${}^{15}$cm$^{-2}$) $\pi$-electron fluid of graphene layers. This fluid bears
off-shell resonating valence bond correlations (RVB) at the carbon-carbon bond
scale. A commensurate twist $\theta\approx 1.1^\circ$, creates charge neutral
carrier puddles (size $\sim$ 50 \AA) and forms a triangular Moir\'e lattice of
local AA registry. AA registry dopes equal numbers of electrons and holes via
interlayer tunneling, whereas AB registry does not. Carriers inside the charge
neutral puddles form equal numbers of -2e and +2e Cooper pairs, using on-shell
RVB correlations. A Josephson-Moir\'e lattice emerges. Coulomb blockade
competes with pair tunneling and creates a Bose Mott insulator. Gate doping
dopes the Bose Hubbard model and creates superconductivity. Our message is that
RVB correlations, which remain dormant in (carrierless) neutral graphene become
on-shell for two added electrons, as they are indistinguishable from electrons
that make the background $\pi$-fluid in graphene.

While the entanglement entropy of a subsystem within a closed system can be
resolved according to its total preserved charge, we find that negativity of
two subsystems may be decomposed into contributions associated with their
charge imbalance. We show that this charge-imbalance decomposition of the
negativity may be measured by employing existing techniques based on creation
and manipulation of many-body twin or triple states in cold atomic setups.
Next, using a geometrical construction in terms of an Aharonov-Bohm-like flux
inserted in a Riemann geometry, we compute this decomposed negativity in
critical one-dimensional systems described by conformal field theory. We show
that it shares the same distribution as the charge-imbalance between the two
subsystems. We numerically confirm our field theory results via an exact
calculations for non-interacting particles based on a double-gaussian
representation of the partially transposed density matrix.

identified star clusters within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in a
consistent way using available photometric data, classify them based on their
mass and strength, and study their spatio- temporal distribution.
  Methods: We have used a semi-automated quantitative method, developed in the
first paper of this series (Paper I), to estimate the cluster parameters using
the V and I band photometric data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment (OGLE) III survey.
  Results: We estimated parameters of 179 star clusters (17 newly
parameterised) and classified them into 4 groups. We present an online catalog
of parameters, and cleaned and isochrone-fitted Color Magnitude Diagrams of 179
clusters. We compiled age information of 468 clusters by combining previous
studies with our catalog, to study their spatio-temporal distribution. Most of
the clusters located in the southern part of the SMC are in the age range 600
Myr-1.25 Gyr, whereas, the clusters younger than 100 Myr are mostly found in
the northern SMC, with the central SMC showing continuous cluster formation.
The peak of the cluster age distribution is identified at 130 Myr, very similar
to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in Paper I.
  Conclusion: We suggest that the burst of cluster formation at 130 Myr is due
to the most recent LMC-SMC interaction. 90% of the studied sample is found to
have mass <1700 M_sun, suggesting that the SMC is dominated by low mass
clusters. There is a tentative evidence for compact clusters in the LMC when
compared to those in the Galaxy and the SMC. A progressive shifting of cluster
location from the South to North of the SMC is identified in last 600 Myr. The
details of spatio-temporal distribution of clusters presented in two videos in
this study can be used as a tool to constrain details of the recent LMC-SMC
interactions.

iteratively solving convex mean-semideviation risk-averse problems to
optimality. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the MESSAGEp algorithm under
a flexible and structure-exploiting set of problem assumptions. In particular:
1) Under appropriate stepsize rules, we establish pathwise convergence of the
MESSAGEp algorithm in a strong technical sense, confirming its asymptotic
consistency. 2) Assuming a strongly convex cost, we show that, for fixed
semideviation order $p>1$ and for $\epsilon\in\left[0,1\right)$, the MESSAGEp
algorithm achieves a squared-${\cal L}_{2}$ solution suboptimality rate of the
order of ${\cal O}(n^{-\left(1-\epsilon\right)/2})$ iterations, where, for
$\epsilon>0$, pathwise convergence is simultaneously guaranteed. This result
establishes a rate of order arbitrarily close to ${\cal O}(n^{-1/2})$, while
ensuring strongly stable pathwise operation. For $p\equiv1$, the rate order
improves to ${\cal O}(n^{-2/3})$, which also suffices for pathwise convergence,
and matches previous results. 3) Likewise, in the general case of a convex
cost, we show that, for any $\epsilon\in\left[0,1\right)$, the MESSAGEp
algorithm with iterate smoothing achieves an ${\cal L}_{1}$ objective
suboptimality rate of the order of ${\cal
O}(n^{-\left(1-\epsilon\right)/\left(4\bf{1}_{\left\{ p>1\right\} }+4\right)})$

coupling matrices are possibly all different and/or singular, that is, its rank
is less than the system dimension. Rank-deficient coupling allows exchange of
limited state information, which is suitable for the study of multi-agent
systems under output coupling. We present a coordinate change that transforms
the heterogeneous multi-agent system into a singularly perturbed form. The slow
dynamics is still a reduced-order multi-agent system consisting of a weighted
average of the vector fields of all agents, and some sub-dynamics of agents.
The weighted average is an emergent dynamics, which we call a blended dynamics.
By analyzing or synthesizing the blended dynamics, one can predict or design
the behavior of a heterogeneous multi-agent system when the coupling gain is
sufficiently large. For this result, stability of the blended dynamics is
required. Since stability of the individual agent is not asked, the stability
of the blended dynamics is the outcome of trading off the stability among the
agents. It can be seen that, under the stability of the blended dynamics, the
initial conditions of the individual agents are forgotten as time goes on, and
thus, the behavior of the synthesized multi-agent system is initialization-free
and is suitable for plug-and-play operation. As a showcase, we apply the
proposed tool to four application problems; distributed state estimation for
linear systems, practical synchronization of heterogeneous Van der Pol
oscillators, estimation of the number of nodes in a network, and a problem of
distributed optimization.

computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal

end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We
find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed

provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations
can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states
for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more
effective learning when solving new tasks described via image-based goals. We
were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies

predict the oldest stars to be less centrally concentrated at $z=0$ than stars
formed at later times as a result of two processes. First, the majority of the
oldest stars are not formed $\textit{in situ}$ but are accreted during
hierarchical assembly. These $\textit{ex situ}$ stars are deposited on
dispersion-supported, halo-like orbits but dominate over old stars formed
$\textit{in situ}$ in the solar neighborhood, and in some simulations, even in
the galactic center. Secondly, old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ are driven
outwards by bursty star formation and energetic feedback processes that create
a time-varying gravitational potential at $z\gtrsim 2$, similar to the process
that creates dark matter cores and expands stellar orbits in bursty dwarf
galaxies. The total fraction of stars that are ancient is more than an order of
magnitude higher for sight lines $\textit{away}$ from the bulge and inner halo

stars as ancient remains challenging, we anticipate that million-star spectral

H2O via transmission spectroscopy, but such signatures are often diminished by
the presence of clouds made of other species. In contrast, highly scattering
H2O clouds can brighten planets in reflected light, enhancing molecular
signatures. Here, we present an extensive parameter space survey of the
prominence of H2O absorption features in reflection spectra of cool (Teff<400K)
giant exoplanetary atmospheres. The impact of effective temperature, gravity,
metallicity, and sedimentation efficiency is explored. We find prominent H2O
features around 0.94um, 0.83um, and across a wide spectral region from
0.4-0.73um. The 0.94um feature is only detectable where high-altitude water
clouds brighten the planet: T~150K, g>~20m/s^2, fsed>~3, m<~10xsolar. In
contrast, planets with g<~20m/s^2 and T>~180K display prominent H2O features
embedded in the Rayleigh slope from 0.4-0.73um. High fsed enhances H2O features
around 0.94um, and enables them to be detected at lower temperatures. High m
results in dampened H2O absorption features, due to H2O vapour condensing to
form bright optically thick clouds that dominate the continuum. We verify these
trends via self-consistent modelling of the low gravity exoplanet HD 192310c,
revealing that its reflection spectrum is expected to be dominated by H2O
absorption from 0.4-0.73um for m<~10xsolar. Our results demonstrate that H2O is
manifestly detectable in reflected light spectra of cool giant planets only
marginally warmer than Jupiter, providing an avenue to directly constrain the

using a reductio ad absurdum argument, replacing black holes by horizonless
configurations with a physical surface and looking for inconsistencies with
electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this approach, the
radius of the horizonless object is always larger than but arbitrarily close to
the position where the horizon of a black hole of the same mass would be
located. Upper bounds on the radius of these alternatives have been provided
using electromagnetic observations (in optical/IR band) of astronomical sources
at the center of galaxies, but lower bounds were lacking, leaving unconstrained
huge regions of parameter space. We show here that lower bounds on the radius
of horizonless objects that do not develop trapping horizons can be placed
using observations of accreting systems. This result is model-independent and
relies only on the local notion of causality dictated by the spacetime geometry

X-ray, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and strong-lensing morphologies with
respect to the weak-lensing signal. Among the three baryonic tracers studied
here, we find that the X-ray morphology is best aligned with the weak-lensing
mass distribution, with a median misalignment angle of $21\pm 7$ degrees. We
also conduct a stacked quadrupole shear analysis assuming that the X-ray major
axis is aligned with that of the projected mass distribution. This yields a
consistent axis ratio of $0.67\pm 0.10$, suggesting again a tight alignment
between the intracluster gas and dark matter.

weak electron-impurity scattering, we provide universal and simple formulas for
the behavior of the thermoelectric conductivities across the
ballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover. In this regime, the electrical
conductivity is relatively unchanged by hydrodynamic effects. In contrast, the
thermal conductivity can be parametrically smaller than predicted by the
Wiedemann-Franz law. A less severe violation of the Mott law arises. We
quantitatively compare the violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law arising from
(i) momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering in the collision integral,
(ii) hydrodynamic modifications of the electron-impurity scattering rate, and
(iii) thermal broadening of the Fermi surface, and show that (i) is the
largest. We present simple formulas for electrical and thermal
magnetoconductivity across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic limit, along with a
more complicated formula for the thermoelectric magnetoconductivity. In a
finite magnetic field, the Lorenz number may be smaller or larger than
predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, and the crossover between these behaviors
is a clear prediction for experiments. The arbitrarily strong violation of the
Wiedemann-Franz law found in our work arises entirely from electron-electron
interaction effects within the Fermi liquid paradigm, and does not imply any
non-Fermi liquid behavior. We predict clear experimental signatures of bulk
hydrodynamics in high-mobility 2D GaAs semiconductor structures, where failure
of the Wiedemann-Franz law should persist down to very low temperatures in
high-quality, low-density samples.

galaxies (ETGs) is primarily due to helium-rich stellar populations that formed
in massive metal-rich globular clusters (GCs) which subsequently dissolved in
the strong tidal field in the central regions of the massive host galaxy. These
massive GCs are assumed to show UV upturns similar to those observed recently
in M87, the central giant elliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster of galaxies.
Data taken from the literature reveals a strong correlation between the
strength of the UV upturn and the specific frequency of metal-rich GCs in ETGs.
Adopting a Schechter function parametrization of GC mass functions, simulations
of long-term dynamical evolution of GC systems show that the observed
correlation between UV upturn strength and GC specific frequency can be
explained by variations in the characteristic truncation mass ${\cal{M}}_{\rm
c}$ such that ${\cal{M}}_{\rm c}$ increases with ETG luminosity in a way that
is consistent with observed GC luminosity functions in ETGs. These findings
suggest that the nature of the UV upturn in ETGs and the variation of its
strength among ETGs are causally related to that of helium-rich populations in
massive GCs, rather than intrinsic properties of field stars in massive
galactic spheroids. With this in mind, I predict that future studies will find
that [N/Fe] decreases with increasing galactocentric radius in massive ETGs,
and that such gradients have the largest amplitudes in ETGs with the strongest
UV upturns.

their lack of small scale force resolution and long time steps cannot give
accurate halo matter profiles or matter power spectrum. High resolution N-body

properly included in hydro simulations. Here we present a scheme to calibrate
the fast simulations to mimic the precision of the hydrodynamic simulations or
high resolution N-body simulations. The scheme is based on a gradient descent
of either effective gravitational potential, which mimics the short range

The scheme is fast and differentiable, and can be incorporated as a
post-processing step into any simulation. It gives very good results for the
matter power spectrum for several of the baryonic feedback and dark matter
simulations, and also gives improved dark matter halo profiles. The scheme is
even able to find the large subhalos, and increase the correlation coefficient
between the fast simulations and the high resolution N-body or hydro
simulations. It can also be used to add baryonic effects to the high resolution
N-body simulations. While the method has free parameters that can be calibrated
on various simulations, they can also be viewed as astrophysical nuisance
parameters describing baryonic effects that can be marginalized over during the

the relative ordering of the input features and output labels is not known.
Such datasets naturally arise from experiments in which the samples are

that treats the unknown permutation as a latent variable. We maximize the
likelihood of observations using a stochastic expectation-maximization (EM)
approach. We compare this to the dominant approach in the literature, which
corresponds to hard EM in our framework. We show on synthetic data that the
stochastic EM algorithm we develop has several advantages, including lower
parameter error, less sensitivity to the choice of initialization, and
significantly better performance on datasets that are only partially shuffled.
We conclude by performing two experiments on real datasets that have been
partially shuffled, in which we show that the stochastic EM algorithm can
recover the weights with modest error.

algorithm, soliton solutions of evolution equations are images of
{\tau}-functions. Typically, the latter are expressed in terms of exponentials,
the arguments of which are linear in the coordinates. Consequently, often,
{\tau}-functions are unbounded in space and time. However, they are not unique.
Exploitation of their non-uniqueness uncovers physically interesting
possibilities: 1) One can construct equivalent {\tau}-functions, which generate
the same traditional (Inverse-Scattering/Hirota)) soliton solutions, yet allow
for the extension of the family of soliton solutions to a wider, parametric
family, in which the traditional solutions are a subset. The parameters are
shifts in individual soliton trajectories. 2) When two wave numbers in a
multi-soliton solution are made to coincide, the reduction of the solution to
one with a lower number of solitons is qualitatively different for solutions
that are within the traditional subset and those that are outside this subset.
3) One can construct {\tau}-functions that are bounded in space and time, in
terms of which soliton solutions become images of localized sources.

similar latencies. However, for architectures such as GPUs where memory
subsystems differ significantly in both bandwidth and latency,
multi-memory-aware methods are crucial for good performance. In addition, our

presented to support machine learning applications for cognitive radio. Machine
learning provides effective tools to automate cognitive radio functionalities
by reliably extracting and learning intrinsic spectrum dynamics. However, there
are two important challenges to overcome, in order to fully utilize the machine
learning benefits with cognitive radios. First, machine learning requires
significant amount of truthed data to capture complex channel and emitter
characteristics, and train the underlying algorithm (e.g., a classifier).
Second, the training data that has been identified for one spectrum environment
cannot be used for another one (e.g., after channel and emitter conditions
change). To address these challenges, a generative adversarial network (GAN)
with deep learning structures is used to 1)~generate additional synthetic
training data to improve classifier accuracy, and 2) adapt training data to
spectrum dynamics. This approach is applied to spectrum sensing by assuming
only limited training data without knowledge of spectrum statistics. Machine
learning classifiers are trained with limited, augmented and adapted training
data to detect signals. Results show that training data augmentation increases
the classifier accuracy significantly and this increase is sustained with

infrastructure-centric and device-centric wireless networks. Device-centric
wireless networks will build from D2D and MCNs. Device-centric wireless
networks can push the limits of edge computing and networking to smart devices

mobile computing, storage and connectivity capabilities. These capabilities can
be more efficiently utilized using demand-driven opportunistic networking that
establishes the connections between devices and nodes based on their capacity
to support the requested demand and services. This paper presents results from
experimental field tests that demonstrate the cellular spectral efficiency
gains that can be achieved from the combined use of device-centric wireless
communications and demand-driven opportunistic networking. The field trials
demonstrate that these technologies can improve the cellular spectral
efficiency of conventional cellular communications by up to a factor of 4.7 and
12 in outdoor pedestrian and vehicular scenarios, respectively. These gains
have been obtained using 4G and IEEE 802.11 technologies. However, the
potential of device-centric wireless networks is not constrained to any
particular radio interface. The results presented in this paper provide
empirical evidences that further motivate progressing towards a new paradigm
where edge networking capabilities are moved to smart mobile devices that
become part of the network fabric, and can opportunistically and locally
integrate network management functions to ensure that sufficient resources are
placed where the demand arises.

projectile motion was not the one we are familiar with today due to Galileo and
Newton but the one taught by Aristotle approximately 1700 years earlier. In
addition to Aristotle's wide-ranging philosophical concerns, his theory arose
from the observation in everyday life that if an object is moving something
must be moving it. This idea works very well for the horse and cart but is
puzzling if you apply it to a thrown stone or spear. Problems with Aristotle's
theory of projectile motion were identified by one or two people between his
time and the 14th century, particularly John Philoponus (6th century AD) and
John Buridan (14th century AD). An archer or a spearman does not need a theory
of projectile motion, just a great deal of practice. But once the gun was
invented it became important to know what angle a barrel should be oriented at
and how much propellant to use, particularly as gunpowder was expensive.
However, for many years afterwards the manufacturing techniques used meant that
cannonballs were a loose fit to gun-barrels making cannons both inaccurate and
of poor reproducibility shot-to-shot. Also air resistance makes the trajectory
both impossible to calculate and qualitatively similar to theories based on
Aristotle's writings. It was not until Galileo and Newton worked on the problem
that a better theory of ideal projectile motion was arrived at.

synchronous machines. The gradual replacement of these machines by asynchronous
renewable-based generation, which provides little or no frequency control,
increases system uncertainty and the risk of instability. This imposes hard
limits on the proportion of renewables that can be integrated into the system.
In this paper we address this issue by developing a framework for performing
frequency control in power systems with arbitrary mixes of conventional and
renewable generation. Our approach is based on a robust stability criterion
that can be used to guarantee the stability of a full power system model on the
basis of a set of decentralised tests, one for each component in the system. It
can be applied even when using detailed heterogeneous component models, and can
be verified using several standard frequency response, state-space, and circuit
theoretic analysis tools. Furthermore the stability guarantees hold
independently of the operating point, and remain valid even as components are
added to and removed from the grid. By designing decentralised controllers for
individual components to meet these decentralised tests, every component can
contribute to the regulation of the system frequency in a simple and provable
manner. Notably, our framework certifies the stability of several existing
(non-passive) power system control schemes and models, and allows for the study

While the logic is the same, the programs obtained from these two

defining the first translation of system F into a simply-typed total language
with a variant of bar recursion. This translation relies on a realizability
interpretation of second-order arithmetic. Due to G\""odel's incompleteness
theorem there is no proof of termination of system F within second-order

second-order arithmetic that it terminates, with its realizability
interpretation providing a bound on the number of reduction steps to reach a
normal form. Using this bound, we compute the normal form through primitive
recursion. Moreover, since the normalization proof of system F proceeds by
induction on typing derivations, the translation is compositional. The
flexibility of our method opens the possibility of getting a more direct

compute the transport coefficients averaged over a period of the incident laser

formula for the conductivity tensor retains its well known form with the
difference that the eigenstates and energies are replaced by the Floquet states

Hall conductivity grows quadratically with the amplitude $A_{0}$ of the U(1)
gauge field for low tilt, while the Nernst conductivity remains unaffected. For
type-II WSMs, the Hall conductivity decreases non-linearly with $A_{0}$ due to
the contribution from the physical momentum cutoff, required to keep finite
electron and hole pocket sizes, and the Nernst conductivity falls of
logarithmically with $A_{0}^2$. These results may serve as a diagnostic for

the analysis of both time-independent and time-dependent survival data.
Simulations suggest that the proposed DAC algorithm substantially outperforms
the full sample-based estimators and the existing DAC algorithm with respect to
the computational speed, while it achieves similar statistical efficiency as
the full sample-based estimators. The proposed algorithm was applied to an

is driven by innovative new smart wearables and interesting service o erings.
This has led to applications that utilize multiple devices around the body to
provide immersive environments such as mixed reality. These applications rely
on a number of di erent types of functions such as sensing, communication and
various types of processing, that require considerable resources. Thus one of
the major challenges in supporting of these applications is dependent on the
battery lifetime of the devices that provide the necessary functionality. The
battery lifetime can be extended by either incorporating a battery with larger
capacity and/or by utilizing the available resources e ciently. However, the
increases in battery capacity are not keeping up with the demand and larger
batteries add to both the weight and size of the device. Thus, the focus of
this paper is to improve the battery e ciency through intelligent resources
utilization. We show that, when the same resource is available on multiple

is possible consider them as a resource pool and further utilize them
intelligently to improve the system lifetime. Speci cally, we formulate the
function allocation algorithm as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

account for (1) a large amount of gas, (2) relatively slow gas velocities, (3)
a high degree of metal enrichment, (4) the similar absorption properties around
both star-forming and passive galaxies, and (5) the observationally inferred
temperature and densities of the CGM gas. We show that galactic wind-driven
bubbles can account for these observed properties. We develop a model
describing the motion of bubbles driven by a hot, fast galactic wind
characteristic of supernova energy injection. The bubble size grows slowly to
hundreds of kiloparsecs over $5-10$ Gyr. For high star formation rates or high
wind mass loading $\dot M_w/\dot M_\star$, the free-flowing hot wind, the
shocked hot wind in the interior of the bubble, and the swept-up halo gas
within the bubble shell can all radiatively cool and contribute to
low-ionization state metal line absorption. We verify that if the free-flowing
wind cools, the shocked wind does as well. We find effective mass loading
factors of $(M_w+M_\mathrm{swept})/M_\star\sim5-12$ as the bubbles sweep into
the CGM. We predict cool gas masses, velocities, column densities, metal
content, and absorption line velocities and linewidths of the bubble for a
range of parameter choices. This picture can reproduce many of the COS-Halos

most recent written version of the content. In replicated storage systems,
consistency comes at the price of delay due to large-scale write and read
operations. Many applications with low latency requirements tolerate data
staleness in order to provide high availability and low operation latency.
Using age of information as the staleness metric, we examine a data updating
system in which real-time content updates are replicated and stored in a
Dynamo-style quorum- based distributed system. A source sends updates to all
the nodes in the system and waits for acknowledgements from the earliest subset
of nodes, known as a write quorum. An interested client fetches the update from
another set of nodes, defined as a read quorum. We analyze the staleness-delay
tradeoff in replicated storage by varying the write quorum size. With a larger
write quorum, an instantaneous read is more likely to get the latest update
written by the source. However, the age of the content written to the system is
more likely to become stale as the write quorum size increases. For shifted
exponential distributed write delay, we derive the age optimized write quorum
size that balances the likelihood of reading the latest update and the
freshness of the latest update written by the source.

Smagorinsky model. Upper bounds are derived on the \textit{computed}
time-averaged energy dissipation rate, $\langle \varepsilon (u^h)\rangle$, for
an under-resolved mesh $h$ for turbulent shear flow. For coarse mesh size $
\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{Re}^{-1}) < h < L $, it is proven, $$ \langle \varepsilon

upper bound is independent of the viscosity at high Reynolds number, is in
accord with the scaling theory of turbulent. This estimate suggests
over-dissipation for any of $C_s>0$ and $\delta>0$, consistent with numerical
evidence on the effects of model viscosity (without wall damping function).

comprehend raw data in various important fields, ranging from intelligence
warfare and healthcare to autonomous transportation and automated
manufacturing. A practical concern, in the rush to adopt DL models as a
service, is protecting the models against Intellectual Property (IP)
infringement. The DL models are commonly built by allocating significant
computational resources that process vast amounts of proprietary training data.
The resulting models are therefore considered to be the IP of the model builder
and need to be protected to preserve the owner's competitive advantage.
  This paper proposes DeepSigns, a novel end-to-end IP protection framework
that enables insertion of coherent digital watermarks in contemporary DL
models. DeepSigns, for the first time, introduces a generic watermarking
methodology that can be used for protecting DL owner's IP rights in both
white-box and black-box settings, where the adversary may or may not have the
knowledge of the model internals. The suggested methodology is based on
embedding the owner's signature (watermark) in the probability density function
(pdf) of the data abstraction obtained in different layers of a DL model.
DeepSigns can demonstrably withstand various removal and transformation
attacks, including model compression, model fine-tuning, and watermark
overwriting. Proof-of-concept evaluations on MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets, as
well as a wide variety of neural network architectures including Wide Residual
Networks, Convolution Neural Networks, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons corroborate
DeepSigns' effectiveness and applicability.

(LOFAR) and at 13-18 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) and
combine them with recent high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) observations at
1-2 GHz, enabling us to study the radio continuum emission over two orders of
magnitude in frequency. The spectrum of the integrated nonthermal flux density
can be fitted by a power law with a spectral steepening towards higher
frequencies or by a curved polynomial. Spectral flattening at low frequencies
due to free-free absorption is detected in star-forming regions of the disk.
The mean magnetic field strength in the halo is 7 +- 2 $\mu$G. The scale
heights of the nonthermal halo emission at 146 MHz are larger than those at 1.5
GHz everywhere, with a mean ratio of 1.7 +- 0.3, indicating that spectral
ageing of CREs is important and that diffusive propagation dominates. The halo
scale heights at 146 MHz decrease with increasing magnetic field strengths
which is a signature of dominating synchrotron losses of CREs. On the other
hand, the spectral index between 146 MHz and 1.5 GHz linearly steepens from the
disk to the halo, indicating that advection rather than diffusion is the
dominating CRE transport process. This issue calls for refined modelling of CRE
propagation.

hierarchical control structure of the hybrid vehicle, i.e., supervisory level

dynamical nonlinear model, and a performance index, both of which are
formulated for power flows at the supervisory level. The model is described as
a bi-modal switched system, consistent with the operating mode of the electric
ED. The performance index prescribing the desired behavior penalizes vehicle
tracking errors, fuel consumption, and frictional losses, as well as sustaining
the battery state of charge (SOC). The power-split strategy is obtained by
first creating the embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) from the original
bi-modal switched system model with the performance index. Direct collocation
is applied to transform the problem into a nonlinear programming problem. A
nonlinear predictive control technique (NMPC) in conjunction with a sequential
quadratic programming solver is used to compute suboptimal numerical solutions
to the PMCP. Methods for approximating the numerical solution to the EOCP with
trajectories of the original bi-modal PHEV are also presented in this paper.
The usefulness of the approach is illustrated via simulation results on several

collected from a dozen literature sources. By assuming that all cluster members
move with the mean cluster velocity to within the velocity dispersion, we use
the observed and the expected motions of the stars to determine individual
cluster membership probabilities. We subsequently derive improved parallaxes
through maximum-likelihood kinematic modelling of the cluster. This method has
an iterative component to deal with 'outliers', caused for instance by double
stars or escaping members. Our method extends an existing method and supports
the mixed presence of stars with and without radial velocities. We find 251
candidate members, 200 of which have a literature radial velocity, and 70 of
which are new candidate members with TGAS astrometry. The cluster is roughly
spherical in its centre but significantly flattened at larger radii. The
observed colour-absolute magnitude diagram shows a clear binary sequence. The
kinematically-modelled parallaxes that we derive are a factor ~1.7 / 2.9 more

hot to glacial, and inferred marine pH spans strongly alkaline to acidic.
Better understanding of early climate and ocean chemistry would improve our
knowledge of the origin of life and its coevolution with the environment. Here,
we use a geological carbon cycle model with ocean chemistry to calculate
self-consistent histories of climate and ocean pH. Our carbon cycle model
includes an empirically justified temperature and pH dependence of seafloor
weathering, allowing the relative importance of continental and seafloor
weathering to be evaluated. We find that the Archean climate was likely
temperate (0-50 {\deg}C) due to the combined negative feedbacks of continental
and seafloor weathering. Ocean pH evolves monotonically from 6.6 (+0.6,-0.4)
(2{\sigma}) at 4.0 Ga to 7.0 (+0.7,-0.5) (2{\sigma}) at the Archean-Proterozoic
boundary, and to 7.9 (+0.1,-0.2) (2{\sigma}) at the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic
boundary. This evolution is driven by the secular decline of pCO2, which in
turn is a consequence of increasing solar luminosity, but is moderated by
carbonate alkalinity delivered from continental and seafloor weathering.
Archean seafloor weathering may have been a comparable carbon sink to
continental weathering, but is less dominant than previously assumed, and would
not have induced global glaciation. We show how these conclusions are robust to
a wide range of scenarios for continental growth, internal heat flow evolution
and outgassing history, greenhouse gas abundances, and changes in the biotic
enhancement of weathering.

of obtaining the sum of an infinite geometric series with only a finite number
of terms. In the worst-case scenario of a two-tailed coin, we prove that the
Cash-Out event occurs in exactly ten tosses.
  If the coin is fair, we show that if a CPDO were allowed to toss the coin
without regard for the Cash-Out rule then the CPDO eventually has a high
probability of attaining large net capital levels; however, hundreds of
thousands of tosses may be needed to do so. Moreover, if after many tosses the
CPDO shows a loss then the probability is high that it will Cash-Out on the
very next toss. If a CPDO experiences a tail on the first toss or on an early
toss, we show that, with high probability, the CPDO will have capital losses
thereafter for hundreds of tosses; moreover, its sequence of net capital levels
is a martingale. When the Cash-Out rule holds, we modify the Cash-In rule to
mean that the CPDO attains a profit of 90 percent on its capital; then we prove
that the CPDO game, almost surely, will end in finitely many tosses and the
probability of Cash-Out is at least 89 percent.
  In light of our results, our fears about the durability of worldwide
financial crises are heightened by the existence of other financial derivatives
more arcane than CPDOs. In particular, we view askance all later-generation
CPDOs that depend mean-reversion assumptions or use a betting strategy similar

has had little industrial adoption. One of the major causes of this slow
adoption is the reluctance of traditional vendors to make radical changes to
their legacy codebases, and the preoccupation of newer vendors (e.g.,
SQL-on-Hadoop products) with implementing standard features. Additionally, the
few AQP engines that are available are each tied to a specific platform and
require users to completely abandon their existing databases---an unrealistic
expectation given the infancy of the AQP technology. Therefore, we argue that a
universal solution is needed: a database-agnostic approximation engine that
will widen the reach of this emerging technology across various platforms.
  Our proposal, called VerdictDB, uses a middleware architecture that requires
no changes to the backend database, and thus, can work with all off-the-shelf
engines. Operating at the driver-level, VerdictDB intercepts analytical queries
issued to the database and rewrites them into another query that, if executed
by any standard relational engine, will yield sufficient information for
computing an approximate answer. VerdictDB uses the returned result set to
compute an approximate answer and error estimates, which are then passed on to
the user or application. However, lack of access to the query execution layer
introduces significant challenges in terms of generality, correctness, and
efficiency. This paper shows how VerdictDB overcomes these challenges and
delivers up to 171$\times$ speedup (18.45$\times$ on average) for a variety of
existing engines, such as Impala, Spark SQL, and Amazon Redshift, while

according to whether the winding numbers which characterize them are opposite

two parabolic bands (one of them can be flat), two Dirac points with the {\it
same} winding number emerge under appropriate distortion (interaction, etc),
following the $++$ scenario. Under further distortion, these Dirac points merge
following the $+-$ scenario, that is corresponding to {\it opposite} winding
numbers. This apparent contradiction is solved by the fact that the winding
number is actually defined around a unit vector on the Bloch sphere and that
this vector rotates during the motion of the Dirac points. This is shown here
within the simplest two-band lattice model (Mielke) exhibiting a flat band. We

challenging task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object

searching for a 3D shape that best explains 2D annotations, or training purely
on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D
INterpreter Networks (3D-INN), an end-to-end trainable framework that
sequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object skeletons and poses.
Our system learns from both 2D-annotated real images and synthetic 3D data.
This is made possible mainly by two technical innovations. First, heatmaps of
2D keypoints serve as an intermediate representation to connect real and
synthetic data. 3D-INN is trained on real images to estimate 2D keypoint
heatmaps from an input image; it then predicts 3D object structure from
heatmaps using knowledge learned from synthetic 3D shapes. By doing so, 3D-INN
benefits from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without
suffering from the domain difference between real and synthesized images, often
due to imperfect rendering. Second, we propose a Projection Layer, mapping
estimated 3D structure back to 2D. During training, it ensures 3D-INN to
predict 3D structure whose projection is consistent with the 2D annotations to
real images. Experiments show that the proposed system performs well on both 2D
keypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery. We also demonstrate that the
recovered 3D information has wide vision applications, such as image retrieval.

and find some emergent supersolid phases below the $m=5/9$ plateau. The wave
functions of the plateau phases in a magnetic field have the particular
construction based on the building blocks of resonating hexagons and their
surrounding sites. Magnon excitations on each of these blocks suffer from a
kinetic frustration effect, namely, they cannot hop easily to the others since
the hopping amplitudes through the two paths destructively cancel out with each
other. The itineracy is thus weakened, and the system is driven toward the
strong coupling regime, which together with the selected paths allowed in real
space bears a supersolid phase. This mechanism is contrary to that proposed in
lattice-Bose gases, where the strong competing interactions suppress with each
other, allowing a small kinetic energy scale to attain the itinerancy.
Eventually, we find a supersolid state in which the pattern of resonating
hexagons are preserved from the plateau crystal state and only one-third of the

partnership in the plant-pollinator mutualistic community. Here we investigate
the effects of the exploitative competition between pollinators on the
structure and the species abundance of the mutualistic networks which evolve by
changing mutualistic partnership towards higher abundance of species.
Simulations show different emergent network characteristics between plants and
animals; hub plants connected to many pollinators are very rare while a few
super-hub pollinators appear with the exploitative competition included, in
contrast to equally many hubs of both types without the exploitative
competition. More interestingly, the abundance of plant species increases with
increasing the exploitative competition strength. We analyze the inverse of the
generalized interaction matrix in the weak-interaction limit to identify the
leading structural factors relevant to the species abundance, which are shown
to be instrumental in optimizing the network structure to increase the
mutualistic benefit and lower the cost of exploitative competition.

crucial for stereo disparity estimation. Left-right consistency check is an

consistency check is an isolated post-processing step and heavily hand-crafted.
This paper proposes a novel left-right comparative recurrent model to perform
left-right consistency checking jointly with disparity estimation. At each
recurrent step, the model produces disparity results for both views, and then
performs online left-right comparison to identify the mismatched regions which
may probably contain erroneously labeled pixels. A soft attention mechanism is
introduced, which employs the learned error maps for better guiding the model
to selectively focus on refining the unreliable regions at the next recurrent
step. In this way, the generated disparity maps are progressively improved by
the proposed recurrent model. Extensive evaluations on KITTI 2015, Scene Flow

demonstrating that state-of-the-art stereo disparity estimation results can be
achieved by this new model.

fast-sampling process on the sample network data to estimate the inclusion
probabilities of the actual survey, and incorporate those in unequal
probability estimators of population means and proportions. Improved versions
of the usual RDS and SB designs are also proposed, termed RDS+ and SB+, to
obtain information on more of the within-sample links. In simulations using the
network from the Colorado Springs study on the heterosexual spread of HIV, the
new estimators produce in most cases lower bias and lower mean square than
current methods. For the variables having the largest mean square errors with
current estimators, the improvement with the new estimator is dramatic. The
estimates are improved even more with the enhanced design versions. For
estimating the population mean degree, the efficiency gains using he new method
are 29 for RDS, 54 for RDS+, 26 for SB and 80 for SB+. This means for example,
with the ordinary RDS design, the mean square error with the new estimator,
same data, is 1/29 that of currently used estimators. The new method is
computationally intricate but is fast and scales up well. The new estimation
method can be used to re-analyze existing network survey data. For new network
sampling studies, it is recommended to use the improved designs as well as the

aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled networks. By considering both line-of-sight (LoS)

(ASE) are derived. Considering that there is no consensus on the path loss
model for studying UAVs in the literature, in this paper, three path loss
models, i.e., high-altitude model, low-altitude model and ultra-low-altitude
model, are investigated and compared. Moreover, the lower bound of the network
performance is obtained assuming that UAVs are hovering randomly according to
homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), while the upper bound is derived
assuming that UAVs can instantaneously move to the positions directly overhead
ground users. From our analytical and simulation results for a practical UAV
height of 50 meters, we find that the network performance of the high-altitude
model and the low-altitude model exhibit similar trends, while that of the
ultra-low-altitude model deviates significantly from the above two models. In
addition, the optimal density of UAVs to maximize the coverage probability

left-right laterality requires a subtle mechanism, as it is associated with
other principal body axes. Any inherent chiral feature in an egg cell can in
principal trigger this spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Individual
microtubules, major cytoskeletal filaments, are known as chiral objects.
However, to date there lacks convincing evidence of a hierarchical connection
of the molecular nature of microtubules to large-scale chirality, particularly
at the length scale of an entire cell. Here we assemble an in-vitro active
layer, consisting of microtubules and kinesin motor proteins, on a glass
surface. Upon inclusion of methyl cellulose, the layered system exhibits a
long-range active nematic phase, characterized by the global alignment of
gliding MTs. This nematic order spans over the entire system size in the
millimeter range and, remarkably, allows hidden collective chirality to emerge
as counterclockwise global rotation of the active MT layer. The analysis based
on our theoretical model suggests that the emerging global nematic order
results from the local alignment of MTs, stabilized by methyl cellulose. It
also suggests that the global rotation arises from the MTs' intrinsic
curvature, leading to preferential handedness. Given its flexibility, this
layered in-vitro cytoskeletal system enables the study of membranous protein
behavior responsible for important cellular developmental processes.

characterized by a multi-component order parameter and a fluctuation-driven

an untrimmed video. This involves both detecting and describing events.
Therefore, all previous methods on dense video captioning tackle this problem
by building two models, i.e. an event proposal and a captioning model, for
these two sub-problems. The models are either trained separately or in
alternation. This prevents direct influence of the language description to the
event proposal, which is important for generating accurate descriptions. To
address this problem, we propose an end-to-end transformer model for dense
video captioning. The encoder encodes the video into appropriate
representations. The proposal decoder decodes from the encoding with different
anchors to form video event proposals. The captioning decoder employs a masking
network to restrict its attention to the proposal event over the encoding
feature. This masking network converts the event proposal to a differentiable
mask, which ensures the consistency between the proposal and captioning during
training. In addition, our model employs a self-attention mechanism, which
enables the use of efficient non-recurrent structure during encoding and leads
to performance improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
end-to-end model on ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII datasets, where we
achieved 10.12 and 6.58 METEOR score, respectively.

momentum unchanged, is distinctly different for massless particles compared to
the little group of rest frame rotations for a massive particle. We give a

notes are representative of the broad spectrum of reverse convertibles notes.
Therefore, the analysis provided in this paper is applicable to many other

  We begin by describing the notes in detail and identifying potential areas of
confusion in the pricing supplement to the prospectus for the notes. We deduce
two possible interpretations of the payment procedure for the notes and apply
the Law of Total Expectation to develop a probabilistic analysis for each

financial advisers generally lacked the mathematical knowledge and expertise to
understand the prospectus completely. Therefore, financial advisers who
recommended purchases of the notes did not have the knowledge and expertise
that is required by a fiduciary relationship, hence were unable to exercise

Carlo simulation, we present modeling of in-orbit instrumental background
dominated by radioactivation. To reduce the computation time required by
straightforward simulations of delayed emissions from activated isotopes, we
insert a semi-analytical calculation that converts production probabilities of
radioactive isotopes by interaction of the primary protons into decay rates at
measurement time of all secondary isotopes. Therefore, our simulation method is
separated into three steps: (1) simulation of isotope production, (2)
semi-analytical conversion to decay rates, and (3) simulation of decays of the
isotopes at measurement time. This method is verified by a simple setup that
has a CdTe semiconductor detector, and shows a 100-fold improvement in
efficiency over the straightforward simulation. The simulation framework was
tested against data measured with a CdTe sensor in the Hard X-ray Imager

experienced a large amount of irradiation from geomagnetically trapped protons

that the measured background is well described by the combination of

clusters are an important indicator of their dynamical evolution history. Based
on deep archival \textit{Chandra} observations, we report a stacking analysis
of 44 globular clusters (GCs) with 0.5-8 keV luminosities $L_{\rm X} \lesssim
10^{35} {\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$ in the M\,31 bulge, which are supposed to be
dominated by cataclysmic variables (CVs) and coronally active binaries (ABs).
We obtain a significant detection at $5\sigma$ level in 0.5-8 keV band. The
average X-ray luminosity per GC and the average X-ray emissivity are determined
to be $5.3 \pm 1.6\times10^{33}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and
$13.2\pm4.3\times10^{27}\rm~erg~{\rm s^{-1}~M^{-1}_{\odot}}$, respectively.
Both of these values are consistent with those of MW GCs. What's more, the
measured emissivity of M31 GCs is also consistent with that of the MW field
stars. Massive GCs have X-ray luminosities which are marginally higher with
less massive ones. Massive GCs also show a lower emissivity ($4.5\pm
2.4\times10^{27}{\rm~erg~s^{-1}~M^{-1}_{\odot}}$) than less massive ones
($15.0\pm 7.8\times10^{27}{\rm~erg~s^{-1}~M^{-1}_{\odot}}$), which is
consistent with the scenario that the (progenitors of) CVs and ABs were more
efficiently destructed via stellar encounters in the more massive GCs. No
dependence of the X-ray emissivity on GC color or on the projected
galactocentric distance of GCs were found.

microlensing event, MOA-2015-BLG-337. The lens system could be a planetary
system with a very low mass host, around the brown dwarf/planetary mass
boundary, or a brown dwarf binary. We found two competing models that explain
the observed light curves with companion/host mass ratios of q~0.01 and ~0.17,
respectively. From the measurement of finite source effects in the best-fit
planetary model, we find a relatively small angular Einstein radius of theta_E
~ 0.03 mas which favors a low mass lens. We conduct a Bayesian analysis to
obtain the probability distribution of the lens properties. The results for the
planetary models strongly depend on the minimum mass, M_min, in the assumed
mass function. In summary, there are two solutions of the lens system: (1) a
brown dwarf/planetary mass boundary object orbited by a super-Neptune (the
planetary model with M_min=0.001 M_sun) and (2) a brown dwarf binary (the
binary model). If the planetary models is correct, this system can be one of a
new class of planetary system, having a low host mass and also a planetary mass
ratio (q <0.03) between the host and its companion. The discovery of the event
is important for the study of planetary formation in very low mass objects. In
addition, it is important to consider all viable solutions in these kinds of
ambiguous events in order for the future comprehensive statistical analyses of
planetary/binary microlensing events.

modulates the rotational bias of flagellar motors which control its
run-and-tumble motion, to migrate towards regions of high nutrient
concentration. Presence of stochastic noise in the biochemical pathway of the
cell has important consequence on the switching mechanism of motor bias, which
in turn affects the runs and tumbles of the cell. We model the intra-cellular
reaction network in terms of coupled time-evolution of three stochastic
variables, kinase activity, methylation level and CheY-P protein level, and
study the effect of methylation noise on the chemotactic performance of the
cell. In presence of a spatially varying nutrient concentration profile, a good
chemotactic performance allows the cell to climb up the concentration gradient
fast and localize in the nutrient-rich regions in the long time limit. Our
simulations show that the best performance is obtained at an optimal noise
strength. While it is expected that chemotaxis will be weaker for very large
noise, it is counter-intuitive that the performance worsens even when noise
level falls below a certain value. We explain this striking result by detailed
analysis of CheY-P protein level statistics for different noise strengths. We
show that when the CheY-P level falls below a certain (noise-dependent)
threshold, the cell tends to move down the concentration gradient of the
nutrient, which has a detrimental effect on its chemotactic response. This
threshold value decreases as noise is increased, and this effect is responsible
for noise-induced enhancement of chemotactic performance. In a harsh chemical
environment, when the nutrient degrades with time, the amount of nutrient
intercepted by the cell trajectory, is an effective performance criterion. In
this case also, we find an optimum noise strength, depending on the nutrient
lifetime.

in several frequency bands ranging from 15 to 80 GHz. A conventional XPR model
of an MPC assuming a constant mean value fits our measurements very poorly and
moreover overestimates the depolarization effect. Our measurements revealed a
clear trend that the MPC XPR is inversely proportional to an excess loss in
reference to the free-space path loss. The model is physically sound as a
higher excess loss is attributed to more lossy interactions or to a greater
number of interactions with objects, leading to a greater chance of
depolarization. The measurements furthermore showed that the MPC XPR is not
strongly frequency or environment dependent. In our MPC XPR model, an MPC with
zero-dB excess loss has a mean XPR of 28 dB. The mean XPR decreases half-a-dB
as the excess loss increases by every dB and the standard deviation around the
mean is 6 dB. The model is applicable to existing channel models to reproduce

  Science (special issue for Cosmic Dust X)",,"10.1016/j.pss.2018.03.019",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the abundance and properties (especially, grain size) of dust
in galaxy halos using available observational data in the literature. There are
two major sets of data. One is (i) the reddening curves at redshifts $z\sim 1$
and 2 derived for Mg II absorbers, which are assumed to trace the medium in
galaxy halos. The other is (ii) the cosmic extinction up to $z\sim 2$ mainly
traced by distant background quasars. For (i), the observed reddening curves
favor a grain radius of $a\sim 0.03~\mu$m for silicate, while graphite is not
supported because of its strong 2175 \AA\ bump. Using amorphous carbon improves
the fit to the reddening curves compared with graphite if the grain radius is
$a\lesssim 0.03~\mu$m. For (ii), the cosmic extinction requires $\eta\gtrsim
10^{-2}$ ($\eta$ is the ratio of the halo dust mass to the stellar mass; the
observationally suggested value is $\eta\sim 10^{-3}$) for silicate if $a\sim
0.03~\mu$m as suggested by the reddening curve constraint. Thus, for silicate,
we do not find any grain radius that satisfies both (i) and (ii) unless the
halo dust abundance is much larger than suggested by the observations. For
amorphous carbon, in contrast, a wide range of grain radius ($a\sim
0.01$--0.3~$\mu$m) is accepted by the cosmic extinction; thus, we find that a
grain radius range of $a\sim 0.01$--0.03 $\mu$m is supported by combining (i)
and (ii). We also discuss the origin of dust in galaxy halos, focusing on the
importance of grain size in the physical mechanism of dust supply to galaxy
halos.

continuous-time ARMA(p,q) (CARMA(p,q)) process sampled equidistantly which is
not necessarily Gaussian. Therefore, an indirect estimation procedure is used.
It is an indirect estimation because we first estimate the parameters of the
auxiliary AR(r) representation ($r\geq 2p-1$) of the sampled CARMA process
using a generalized M- (GM-)estimator. Since the map which maps the parameters
of the auxiliary AR(r) representation to the parameters of the CARMA process is
not given explicitly, a separate simulation part is necessary where the
parameters of the AR(r) representation are estimated from simulated CARMA
processes. Then, the parameter which takes the minimum distance between the
estimated AR parameters and the simulated AR parameters gives an estimator for
the CARMA parameters. First, we show that under some standard assumptions the
GM-estimator for the AR(r) parameters is consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed. Next, we prove that the indirect estimator is consistent and
asymptotically normally distributed as well using in the simulation part the
asymptotically normally distributed LS-estimator. The indirect estimator
satisfies several important robustness properties such as weak resistance,
$\pi_{d_n}$-robustness and it has a bounded influence functional. The practical
applicability of our method is demonstrated through a simulation study with
replacement outliers and compared to the non-robust quasi-maximum-likelihood
estimation method.

localization. Evaluating the spatial correlation functions of the nonaffine
squared displacements of atoms during each elementary avalanche event, we
observe that the shapes of the elementary avalanche regions in the well-relaxed
glasses tend to be anisotropic, whereas those in the less-relaxed glasses are
relatively isotropic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a temporal clustering in
the direction of the avalanche propagation emerges, and a considerable
correlation between the anisotropy and avalanche size exists in the

between model complexity (i.e. accuracy) and computational burden has to be
made. This is a challenging task with a lot of constraints, since the model
order is directly linked to the number of system states. Even though white-box

often cannot be modeled satisfactorily with an expedient computational load.
Hence, a Koopman operator-based model reduction technique is presented which

describing the dynamics of observables of nonlinear autonomous dynamical
systems which can be nicely applied to the switching principle of power

the number of system states are decoupled which allows us to consider more

indicator, it is often used as a determinant factor for describing various
aspects of urban phenomena. On the other hand, a plethora of different measures
that aim at characterizing the urban form have been introduced in the
literature, often with the risk of redundancy. Here, we argue that two measures
are enough to capture a wealth of different forms of the population density.
First, fluctuations of the local density can be very important and we should
distinguish almost homogeneous cities from highly heterogeneous ones. This is
easily characterized by an indicator such as the Gini coefficient $G$, or
equivalently by the relative standard deviation or the entropy. The second
important dimension is the spatial organization of the heterogeneities in
population density and we propose a dispersion index $\eta$ that characterizes
the degree of localization of highly populated areas. We argue that these two
dimensions are enough to characterize the spatial organization of cities, and
we discuss this approach using a dataset of about $4,500$ cities belonging to
the $10$ largest urban areas in France, for which we have high resolution data.
Representing cities in the plane $(G,\eta)$ allows us to construct families of
cities. On average, compactness increases with heterogeneity, and we find four
large categories of cities (with population $>10,000$ inhabitants): (i) first,
homogeneous and dispersed cities with small density fluctuations, (ii) very
heterogeneous cities with a compact organization of large densities areas. The
last two groups comprise heterogeneous cities with (iii) a monocentric
organization or (iv) a more delocalized, polycentric structure. Integrating
these two parameters in econometric analysis could improve our understanding of
the impact of urban form on various socio-economical aspects.

parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does
not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly
parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with
sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called ""bi-directional
block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)"", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding.
It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN
splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each
block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the
outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only
needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is
required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation
of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode
temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for different NLP tasks,
Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better

distinctiveness for each caption and diversity for different images. To address

external fields had a similar critical height for torus instability, a similar
local torus-stable region, but a larger magnetic flux ratio (of low corona and
near-surface region) as compared to the successful one. During the failed
eruption, a smaller Lorentz force impulse was exerted on the outward ejecta;
the ejecta had a much slower rising speed. Factors that might lead to the
initiation of the failed eruption are identified: 1) a weaker non-potentiality
of the core region, and a smaller Lorentz force impulse gave the ejecta a small
momentum; 2) the large flux ratio, and the local torus-stable region in the
corona provided strong confinements that made the erupting structure regain an
equilibrium state.

chromospheric emission using the Sun as a test-bench and a reference. We
analyzed a time series of MDI magnetograms jointly with chromospheric emission
time series obtained at Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak observatories. This has
allowed us to study the variability in the quiet Sun over the solar cycle, and
then, based on available relations between magnetic fields in active structures
and chromospheric emission, to propose an empirical reconstruction of the solar
chromospheric emission based on all contributions. We show that the magnetic
flux covering the solar surface, including in the quieted regions, varies in
phase with the solar cycle, suggesting a long-term relationship between the
global dynamo and the contribution of all components of solar activity. We have
been able to propose a reconstruction of the solar S-index, including a
relationship between the weak field component and its chomospheric emission,
which is in good agreement with the literature. This allows us to explain that
stars with a low average chromospheric emission level exhibit a low
variability. We conclude that weak flux regions significantly contribute to the
chromospheric emission; these regions should be critical in explaining the
lower variability associated with the lower average activity level in other
stars as compared to the Sun and estimated from their chromospheric emission.

  Pedestrian Detection","10 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To better detect pedestrians of various scales, deep multi-scale methods
usually detect pedestrians of different scales by different in-network layers.
However, the semantic levels of features from different layers are usually
inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch and high-level semantic
network by gradually splitting a base network into multiple different branches.
As a result, the different branches have the same depth and the output features
of different branches have similarly high-level semantics. Due to the
difference of receptive fields, the different branches are suitable to detect
pedestrians of different scales. Meanwhile, the multi-branch network does not
introduce additional parameters by sharing convolutional weights of different
branches. To further improve detection performance, skip-layer connections
among different branches are used to add context to the branch of relatively
small receptive filed, and dilated convolution is incorporated into part
branches to enlarge the resolutions of output feature maps. When they are
embedded into Faster RCNN architecture, the weighted scores of proposal
generation network and proposal classification network are further proposed.
Experiments on KITTI dataset, Caltech pedestrian dataset, and Citypersons
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. On these pedestrian
datasets, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance.
Moreover, experiments on COCO benchmark show the proposed method is also
suitable for general object detection.

expensive pixel-level masks, remains unexplored. In this paper, we tackle this
challenging problem by exploiting class peak responses to enable a
classification network for instance mask extraction. With image labels
supervision only, CNN classifiers in a fully convolutional manner can produce
class response maps, which specify classification confidence at each image
location. We observed that local maximums, i.e., peaks, in a class response map
typically correspond to strong visual cues residing inside each instance.
Motivated by this, we first design a process to stimulate peaks to emerge from
a class response map. The emerged peaks are then back-propagated and
effectively mapped to highly informative regions of each object instance, such
as instance boundaries. We refer to the above maps generated from class peak
responses as Peak Response Maps (PRMs). PRMs provide a fine-detailed
instance-level representation, which allows instance masks to be extracted even
with some off-the-shelf methods. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first
time report results for the challenging image-level supervised instance
segmentation task. Extensive experiments show that our method also boosts
weakly supervised pointwise localization as well as semantic segmentation
performance, and reports state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks,

crater density, might be interpreted to have formed as a result of recent
cryovolcanic activity. In particular, the morphology of smooth deposits
covering parts of the surface, and their relationship to the surrounding
terrains, suggest that they result from liquid extrusions. Furthermore, recent
literature suggests that the emplacement of liquid-related features, such as
double ridges, lenticulae and chaos could result from the presence of liquid
reservoirs beneath the surface. We model the ascent of liquid water through a
fracture or a pipe-like conduit from a subsurface reservoir to
Europa\textquoteright s surface and calculate the eruption time-scale and the
total volume extruded during the eruption, as a function of the reservoir
volume and depth. We also estimate the freezing time of a subsurface reservoir
necessary to trigger an eruption. Our model is derived for pure liquid water
and for a briny mixture outlined by Kargel (1991): 81 wt% H$_{2}$O + 16 wt%
MgSO$_{4}$ + 3 wt% Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$. Considering compositional data for salt

total extruded cryolava volume ranges from $10^{3}\,\mathrm{m^{3}}$ to
$10^{8}\,\mathrm{m^{3}}$ and the duration of the eruptions varies from few
minutes to few tens of hours. The freezing time-scale of the cryomagma
reservoirs varies with cryomagma composition and the temperature gradient in
the ice shell: from a few days to a thousand years for pure water cryomagma,

been seen to repeat, though the extent to which it is exceptional remains
unclear. We discuss detecting repetition from FRBs, which will be very
important for understanding their physical origin, and which also allows for
host galaxy localisation. We show how the combination of instrument
sensitivity, beamshapes, and individual FRB luminosity functions affect the
detection of sources whose repetition is not necessarily described by a
homogeneous Poisson process. We demonstrate that the Canadian Hydrogen

which host galaxies could be subsequently localised using other
interferometers, but it will not be an ideal instrument for monitoring FRB
121102. If the luminosity distributions of repeating FRBs are given by
power-laws with significantly more dim than bright bursts, CHIME's repetition
discoveries could preferentially come not from its own discoveries, but from
sources first detected with lower-sensitivity instruments like the Australian
Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in fly's eye mode. We then discuss
observing strategies for upcoming surveys, and advocate following up sources at
approximately regular intervalsand with telescopes of higher sensitivity, when
possible. Finally, we discuss doing pulsar-like periodicity searching on FRB
follow-up data, based on the idea that while most pulses are undetectable,
folding on an underlying rotation period could reveal the hidden signal.

receiver using signal-to-noise-ratio measurements. However, this attack
necessitates the attacker to perfectly know the realizations of all the
channels in the model. We first introduce the consequences of the flipping
attack on narrowband frequency-flat channels, and subsequently discuss its
feasibility in wideband frequency-selective channels. From the legitimate
users' perspective, we present a method to detect this attack and also propose
heuristics to improve the error-performance under the attack. We emphasize that
future cyber-physical systems that employ DSSS should design transceivers to
detect the proposed flipping attack, and then apply appropriate
countermeasures.

accurate segmentation is of utmost importance for the evaluation of bone

endowed with a local state that changes over time as the agent interacts with
its neighbours. The neighbourhood structure is given by a graph. In a recent
paper [Simon et al. 2011], the authors used the automorphisms of the underlying
graph to generate a lumpable partition of the joint state space ensuring
Markovianness of the lumped process for binary dynamics. However, many large
random graphs tend to become asymmetric rendering the automorphism-based
lumping approach ineffective as a tool of model reduction. In order to mitigate
this problem, we propose a lumping method based on a notion of local symmetry,
which compares only local neighbourhoods of vertices. Since local symmetry only
ensures approximate lumpability, we quantify the approximation error by means
of Kullback-Leibler divergence rate between the original Markov chain and a
lifted Markov chain. We prove the approximation error decreases monotonically.
The connections to fibrations of graphs are also discussed.

around its orbit in the protoplanetary disk. A pressure maximum can be formed
outside the gap where solids that are loosely coupled to the gas, typically in
the pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building
such a trap, which is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM), is important for
two reasons: it marks the end of planetary growth by pebble accretion, and the
trapped dust forms a ring that may be observed with millimetre observations. We
study the effect of disk turbulence on the pebble isolation mass and find its
dependence on the gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio, and particles Stokes
number. By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical simulations, we found the minimum
planet mass to form a radial pressure maximum beyond the orbit of the planet,
which is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then carried out 2D gas
plus dust hydrodynamical simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion
impacts particles trapping at the pressure maximum. We finally provide a
semi-analytical calculation of the PIM based on comparing the radial drift
velocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuations
around the pressure maximum. From our results of gas simulations, we provide an
expression for the PIM versus disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity. Our
gas plus dust simulations show that the effective PIM can be nearly an order of
magnitude larger in high-viscosity disks because turbulence diffuse particles
out of the pressure maximum. This is quantified by our semi-analytical
calculation, which gives an explicit dependence of the PIM with Stokes number
of particles. We conclude than disk turbulence can significantly alter the PIM,
depending on the level of turbulence in regions of planet formation.

  behavioural and community ecology","All authors contributed equally",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Interactions are ubiquitous across biological systems. These interactions can
be abstracted as patterns of connections among distinct units such as genes,
proteins, individual organisms, or species which form a hierarchy of biological
organisation. Connections in this hierarchy are arranged in a nested structure:
gene and protein networks shape phenotypic traits and together constitute
individuals, individuals are embedded within populations, populations within
communities, and communities within ecosystems. This pervasive ""nestedness"" of
networks can result in propagation of the effects from within-level
interactions at one level to units at higher or lower levels of organization.
The concept of nested biological networks is implicit in a variety of
disciplines ranging from the study of genetic circuits regulating phenotypic
trait expression (Babu et al. 2004), to the study of predator-prey interactions
influencing community composition (Poisot et al. 2016). However, studies
typically only address interactions within and among directly neighbouring
hierarchical levels, such as genotypes and phenotypic traits, or populations
and communities. Here, we formalise nested networks as having nodes that can
contain, or be embedded in, other nodes, and where edges can bridge connections
between sets of embedded nodes. We then argue that explicitly accounting for
network nestedness across levels of organization will encourage integrative
thinking on new interdisciplinary research fronts. We focus on two phenomena in
particular: (i) indirect connections among units can arise from the structure
of connections at higher or lower levels of organisation, (ii) the propagation
of effects across neighbouring hierarchical levels of organization. This

consider generic constellations with any arbitrary shape and size, and confine
ourselves to one of the main categories of constructive interference regions
(CIR), namely, distance preserving CIR (DPCIR). We provide a comprehensive
study of DPCIRs and derive some properties for these regions. Using these
properties, we first show that any signal in a given DPCIR has a norm greater
than or equal to the norm of the corresponding constellation point if and only
if the convex hull of the constellation contains the origin. It is followed by
proving that the power of the noiseless received signal lying on a DPCIR is a
monotonic strictly increasing function of two parameters relating to the
infinite Voronoi edges. Using the convex description of DPCIRs and their
properties, we formulate two design problems, namely, the SLP power
minimization with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints,
and the SLP SINR balancing problem under max-min fairness criterion. The SLP
power minimization based on DPCIRs can straightforwardly be written as a
quadratic program (QP). We provide a simplified reformulation of this problem
which is less computationally complex. The SLP max-min SINR, however, is
non-convex in its original form, and hence difficult to tackle. We propose
several alternative optimization approaches, including semidefinite program

Magnetic Perturbations (MP) in low density high confinement mode (H-mode)

requirements for full ELM suppression in our experiments are: 1. The poloidal
spectrum of the MP must be aligned for best plasma response from weakly stable
kink-modes, which amplify the perturbation, 2. The plasma edge density must be
below a critical value, $3.3 \times 10^{19}$~m$^{-3}$. The edge collisionality
is in the range $\nu^*_i = 0.15-0.42$ (ions) and $\nu^*_e = 0.15-0.25$
(electrons). However, our data does not show that the edge collisionality is
the critical parameter that governs access to ELM suppression. 3. The pedestal
pressure must be kept sufficiently low to avoid destabilisation of small ELMs.
This requirement implies a systematic reduction of pedestal pressure of
typically 30\% compared to unmitigated ELMy H-mode in otherwise similar
plasmas. 4. The edge safety factor $q_{95}$ lies within a certain window.
Within the range probed so far, $q_{95}=3.5-4.2$, one such window,
$q_{95}=3.57-3.95$ has been identified. Within the range of plasma rotation
encountered so far, no apparent threshold of plasma rotation for ELM

in the entire pedestal region, for which two-fluid MHD models predict that the
resistive plasma response to the applied MP is shielded.

channels, which may result in transmission errors with a high probability due
to its unreliable connectivity. For video transmission, unreliable connectivity
may cause significant degradation of the content. Improving or keeping video
quality over lossy channel is therefore a very important research topic. Error
concealment with data hiding (ECDH) is an effective way to conceal the errors
introduced by channels. It can reduce error propagation between neighbor
blocks/frames comparing with the methods exploiting temporal/spatial
correlations. The existing video ECDH methods often embed the motion vectors
(MVs) into the specific locations. Nevertheless, specific embedding locations
cannot resist against random errors. To compensate the unreliable connectivity
in mobile cloud environment, in this paper, we present a video ECDH scheme
using 3D reversible data hiding (RDH), in which each MV is repeated multiple
times, and the repeated MVs are embedded into different macroblocks (MBs)
randomly. Though the multiple embedding requires more embedding space,
satisfactory trade-off between the introduced distortion and the reconstructed
video quality can be achieved by tuning the repeating times of the MVs. For
random embedding, the lost probability of the MVs decreases rapidly, resulting
in better error concealment performance. Experimental results show that the
PSNR values gain about 5dB at least comparing with the existing ECDH methods.
Meanwhile, the proposed method improves the video quality significantly.

demonstrated for small DLs in tungsten, formed by low-dose ion-implantation,
that appear as circular spots in diffraction contrast images. To extract the 3D
position of specific DLs, their 2D position in multiple weak-beam dark-field
TEM micrographs, recorded at different tilt angles, is fitted. From this fit
the geometric centre and size of each DL in each micrograph can be extracted.
Using a forward prediction approach each specific DL is identified in all the
2D projections. A system of linear equations can then be setup, linking the 3D
position of each DL to its 2D position in each projection. If more than 2
projections are available this system of equations is over-determined, and the
3D position of each DL is found by least-squares fitting. The results are in
good agreement with the damage microstructure recovered using a generalized
weighted back-projection method. Importantly the triangulation approach
requires fewer projections and is less sensitive to the angular range covered
by the projections. Our new method is also less sensitive to contrast
variations due to local deviations from the diffraction condition. These
advantages, as well as the accuracy of the triangulation method, are discussed

the same goal as Waldhausen's, in order to perform computations of algebraic
K-theory of group rings. However, all groups known to be weakly regular
coherent are also coarsely regular coherent. The new framework allows us to
prove structural results by developing permanence properties, including the
particularly important fibering permanence property, for coarse regular
coherence.

two or more concurrent transactions clash on a data item.
  While the standard solution to such conflicts is to immediately abort one of
the transactions, some practical systems consider the alternative of delaying
conflict resolution for a short interval, which may allow one of the
transactions to commit. The challenge in the transactional conflict problem is
to choose the optimal length of this delay interval so as to minimize the
overall running time penalty for the conflicting transactions. In this paper,
we propose a family of optimal online algorithms for the transactional conflict

of the ski rental problem, while the requestor wins case leads to a new version
of this classical problem, for which we derive optimal deterministic and
randomized algorithms.
  Moreover, we prove that, under a simplified adversarial model, our algorithms
are constant-competitive with the offline optimum in terms of throughput.
  We validate our algorithmic results empirically through a hardware simulation
of hardware transactional memory (HTM), showing that our algorithms can lead to
non-trivial performance improvements for classic concurrent data structures.

Extended version of a paper accepted at FoSSaCS 2018",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One perspective on quantum algorithms is that they are classical algorithms
having access to a special kind of memory with exotic properties. This
perspective suggests that, even in the case of quantum algorithms, the control
flow notions of sequencing, conditionals, loops, and recursion are entirely
classical. There is however, another notion of control flow, that is itself
quantum. The notion of quantum conditional expression is reasonably
well-understood: the execution of the two expressions becomes itself a
superposition of executions. The quantum counterpart of loops and recursion is
however not believed to be meaningful in its most general form.
  In this paper, we argue that, under the right circumstances, a reasonable
notion of quantum loops and recursion is possible. To this aim, we first
propose a classical, typed, reversible language with lists and fixpoints. We
then extend this language to the closed quantum domain (without measurements)
by allowing linear combinations of terms and restricting fixpoints to
structurally recursive fixpoints whose termination proofs match the proofs of
convergence of sequences in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We
additionally give an operational semantics for the quantum language in the
spirit of algebraic lambda-calculi and illustrate its expressiveness by
modeling several common unitary operations.

  In the first part of this paper, we summarise some of these methods and we

  In the second part, we consider many instances of this general method and we

5. Finally, by a computer search, we determine all snarks having circular flow
number 5 up to 36 vertices. It turns out that all such snarks of order at most

SO$(m)$. First, according to the Cartan-Dieudonn\'e theorem, every rotation

also be expressed as the exponential of some anti-symmetric matrix.
  In this paper, we study similar descriptions of a group of rotations SO${}_0$
in the superspace setting. This group can be seen as the action of the functor
of points of the orthosymplectic supergroup OSp$(m|2n)$ on a Grassmann algebra.
While still being connected, the group SO${}_0$ is thus no longer compact. As a
consequence, it cannot be fully described by just one action of the exponential
map on its Lie algebra. Instead, we obtain an Iwasawa-type decomposition for
this group in terms of three exponentials acting on three direct summands of
the corresponding Lie algebra of supermatrices.
  At the same time, SO${}_0$ strictly contains the group generated by
super-vector reflections. Therefore, its Lie algebra is isomorphic to a certain
extension of the algebra of superbivectors. This means that the Spin group in
this setting has to be seen as the group generated by the exponentials of the
so-called extended superbivectors in order to cover SO${}_0$. We also study the

Both cases are not viable in practice since there are too many possibilities to

self-adaptive systems is only available at runtime and therefore difficult to
predict at early development stages. Despite all the efforts on assurances for
self-adaptive systems at design or runtime, there is still a gap on verifying

conductivity and the pseudogap {\Delta}*(T) in optimally doped YBCO single

resistivity measurements. A pronounced enhancement of the pseudogap under
pressure of dln{\Delta}*/dP= 0.32, which is only a factor of 1.12 smaller than
in slightly doped single crystals, is revealed for the first time. This implies
a somewhat more moderate increase of the coupling strength in optimally doped
cuprates with increasing pressure. Simultaneously, the ratio
2{\Delta}*(T_c)/k_BT_c=5 at P=0 GPa, which is typical for high-temperature
superconductors with strong coupling, increases by 16% with increasing
pressure. At the same time, the pressure effect on T_c is minor: dT_c/dP=+0.73
K/GPa, whereas dln{\rho}/dP=-17% 1/GPa is comparable with that in lightly doped
YBCO single crystals. This suggests that the mechanisms of the pressure effect
on {\rho}(T) and T_c are noticeably different. Independently of pressure, near
T_c, the excess conductivity is well described by the Aslamazov-Larkin (3D-AL)
and 2D Hikami-Larkin fluctuation theories, exhibiting a 3D-2D crossover with
increasing temperature. However, the temperature interval T_c<T<T_{01}, in
which excess conductivity obeys the classical fluctuation theories, is
exceptionally narrow (~1.16 K). Nevertheless, a peculiarity at the temperature
T_{01}, up to which the wave function phase stiffness in the superconductor is
maintained, is clearly observed in the dependence {\Delta}*(T). Below T_{01} a
fast growth of {\Delta}*(T) is revealed for the first time. It can be
associated with a sudden increase of the superfluid density, n_s, that is the
density of fluctuating Cooper pairs (short-range phase correlations) forming in
the sample when T approaches T_c.

During their journey to perihelion, comets may appear in the
field-of-view of space-borne optical instruments, showing in some cases a
nicely developed plasma tail extending from their coma and exhibiting an
oscillatory behaviour. Aims. The oscillations of cometary tails may be
explained in terms of vortex shedding because of the interaction of the comet
with the solar wind streams. Therefore, it is possible to exploit these
oscillations in order to infer the value of the Strouhal number $St$, which
quantifies the vortex shedding phenomenon, and the physical properties of the
local medium. Methods. We used the Heliospheric Imager (HI) data of the Solar
TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission to study the oscillations of
the tails of the comets 2P/Encke and C/2012 S1 (ISON) during their perihelion
in Nov 2013, determining the Strouhal numbers from the estimates of the halo
size, the relative speed of the solar wind flow and the period of the
oscillations. Results. We found that the estimated Strouhal numbers are very
small, and the typical value of $St\sim0.2$ would be extrapolated for size of
the halo larger than $\sim10^6$ km. Conclusions. Despite the vortex shedding
phenomenon has not been unambiguously revealed, the findings suggest that some
MHD instability process is responsible for the observed behaviour of cometary
tails, which can be exploited for probing the physical conditions of the
near-Sun region.

  Correction on problem statement (Problem 1), and change in authors' info",,,,"math.OC cs.RO cs.SY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The control and sensing of large-scale systems results in combinatorial
problems not only for sensor and actuator placement but also for scheduling or
observability/controllability. Such combinatorial constraints in system design
and implementation can be captured using a structure known as matroids. In
particular, the algebraic structure of matroids can be exploited to develop
scalable algorithms for sensor and actuator selection, along with quantifiable
approximation bounds. However, in large-scale systems, sensors and actuators
may fail or may be (cyber-)attacked. The objective of this paper is to focus on
resilient matroid-constrained problems arising in control and sensing but in
the presence of sensor and actuator failures. In general, resilient
matroid-constrained problems are computationally hard. Contrary to the
non-resilient case (with no failures), even though they often involve objective
functions that are monotone or submodular, no scalable approximation algorithms
are known for their solution. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm,
that also has the following properties: First, it achieves system-wide
resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service
attacks or failures. Second, it is scalable, as our algorithm terminates with
the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient)
matroid-constrained optimization. Third, it provides provable approximation
bounds on the system performance, since for monotone objective functions our
algorithm guarantees a solution close to the optimal. We quantify our
algorithm's approximation performance using a notion of curvature for monotone
(not necessarily submodular) set functions. Finally, we support our theoretical
analyses with numerical experiments, by considering a control-aware sensor
selection scenario, namely, sensing-constrained robot navigation.

Despite considerable interest, there exist families of natural, high performing

showing for the first time that, under a set of analytic assumptions, a family

relaxations. Our result is based on a new analysis of an asynchronous variant
of the classic power-of-two-choices load balancing algorithm, in which
placement choices can be based on inconsistent, outdated information (this

large, making inferences - here limited to determining marginal or limit

of such a chain is usually too detailed for the inferences we are interested
in, in the sense that a less detailed - smaller - state space suffices to
unambiguously formalise the inference. However, in general this so-called
lumped state space inhibits computing exact inferences because the
corresponding dynamics are unknown and/or intractable to obtain. We address
this issue by considering an imprecise continuous-time Markov chain. In this
way, we are able to provide guaranteed lower and upper bounds for the
inferences of interest, without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.

we discuss the degenerate cases for such two types of mixed soliton solutions

manipulators, wheeled and legged robots, and quadrotors. Inverse dynamics
control and feedforward linearization techniques are typically used to convert
the complex nonlinear dynamics of Lagrangian systems to a set of decoupled
double integrators, and then a standard, outer-loop controller can be used to
calculate the commanded acceleration for the linearized system. However, these
methods typically depend on having a very accurate system model, which is often
not available in practice. While this challenge has been addressed in the
literature using different learning approaches, most of these approaches do not
provide safety guarantees in terms of stability of the learning-based control
system. In this paper, we provide a novel, learning-based control approach
based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures both stability of the
closed-loop system and high-accuracy tracking. We use GPs to approximate the
error between the commanded acceleration and the actual acceleration of the
system, and then use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to calculate an
upper bound on the uncertainty of the linearized model. This uncertainty bound
is then used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure stability of the
overall system. Moreover, we show that the tracking error converges to a ball
with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we verify the
effectiveness of our approach via simulations on a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF)

technology to cope with the increasing pressure on the backhaul connections,
and to reduce the delay for demanding video applications. In this work,
delivery of an interactive multiview video to a set of wireless users is
studied in an heterogeneous cellular network. Differently from existing works
that focus on the optimization of the delivery delay and ignore the video
characteristics, the caching and scheduling policies are jointly optimized,
taking into account the quality of the delivered video and the video delivery
time constraints. We formulate our joint caching and scheduling problem as the
average expected video distortion minimization, and show that this problem is
NP-hard. We then provide an equivalent formulation based on submodular set
function maximization and propose a greedy solution with
$\frac{1}{2}(1-\mbox{e}^{-1})$ approximation guarantee. The evaluation of the
proposed joint caching and scheduling policy shows that it significantly
outperforms benchmark algorithms based on popularity caching and independent

particular, this equivalence requires keeping only those terms that generate
time-independent ring diagrams, in the Goldstone sense. Here I show that this
equivalence extends to neutral excitation energies, for which those calculated
in the RPA are identical to those calculated using an approximation to
equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with double excitations (EOM-CCD).
The equivalence requires three approximations to EOM-CCD: first, the
ground-state double-excitation amplitudes are obtained from the ring-CCD
equations (the same as for the correlation energy); second, the EOM eigenvalue
problem is truncated to the single-excitation (one particle + one hole)
subspace; third, the similarity transformation of the Fock operator must be
neglected, as it corresponds to a dressing of the single-particle propagator,
which is not present in the conventional RPA.

recursive processes, have self-similarity and infinite complexity. In
particular, they also have a fractional dimension. Although several proposals
for the study of fractals at the basic level are present in the literature,
only few proposals for the study of real fractals exist, which does not seem
reasonable in our point of view considering the wealth of the theme and its
potentiality as interdisciplinary theme in math education. For this reason, in
this text, we present a simple and easily assimilable method to calculate the
fractal dimension of any two-dimensional object. The method is divided into two
steps. In the first step, students learn how is calculated the fractal
dimension of any figure and they do this manually. Next part, which according
to our best knowledge is new, with respect to the application in classroom,
consists in the procedure of determining the fractal dimension using a
smartphone and a computer with free software \textit {imageJ} installed. This
proposal is easily understandable, considering the high school curriculum, and
readily replicable, considering its easy adaptation to the most diverse school
realities.

three-dimensional architectures for applications such as multi-phase droplet
preparation or wet-phase fibre spinning. Here the challenge of nanofabrication
inside a microfluidic chip is tackled for the showcase of a spider-inspired
spinneret. Multiphoton lithography, an additive manufacturing method, was used
to produce free-form microfluidic masters, subsequently replicated by soft
lithography. Into the resulting microfluidic device, a threedimensional
spider-inspired spinneret was directly fabricated in-chip via multiphoton
lithography. Applying this unprecedented fabrication strategy, the to date
smallest printed spinneret nozzle is produced. This spinneret resides tightly
sealed, connecting it to the macroscopic world. Its functionality is
demonstrated by wet-spinning of single-digit micron fibres through a
polyacrylonitrile coagulation process induced by a water sheath layer. The
methodology developed here demonstrates fabrication strategies to interface
complex architectures into classical microfluidic platforms. Using multiphoton
lithography for in-chip fabrication adopts a high spatial resolution technology
for improving geometry and thus flow control inside microfluidic chips. The
showcased fabrication methodology is generic and will be applicable to multiple
challenges in fluid control and beyond.

each observer to carry his own quantum state; we find that the communication of

persistent homology, was introduced by Chan, Carlsson, and Rabad\'an in 2013.
This associates a sequence of signatures called barcodes to genomic data
sampled from an evolutionary history. In this paper, we develop theoretical
foundations for this approach. First, we present a novel formulation of the
underlying inference problem. Specifically, we introduce and study the novelty
profile, a simple, stable statistic of an evolutionary history which not only
counts recombination events but also quantifies how recombination creates
genetic diversity. We propose that the (hitherto implicit) goal of the
topological approach to recombination is the estimation of novelty profiles. We
then study the problem of obtaining a lower bound on the novelty profile using
barcodes. We focus on a low-recombination regime, where the evolutionary
history can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree,
which differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in
this regime, under a complete sampling assumption, the $1^\mathrm{st}$ barcode
yields a lower bound on the novelty profile, and hence on the number of
recombination events. For $i>1$, the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ barcode is empty. In
addition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones
which hold for any subsample of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish
these results, we describe the topology of the Vietoris--Rips filtrations
arising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a step towards
a probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a
fixed galled tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the
intervals of the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$ barcode are independent random variables.
Using simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these intervals to
recombination.

first case, the relay node decodes the incoming signal symbol and forwards it
to the receiver using a different type of molecule. Then, the receiver detects
the information bits by only considering the molecules from the relay node. In
the second case, the receiver considers both the types of molecules sent from
the transmitter and the relay node. For these two scenarios, the optimal

recognition. In signature generation, a face image is iteratively divided into
multi-level patches. Two different types of patch divisions and signatures are
introduced for 2D facial image and texture-lifted image, respectively. The
matcher training consists of three steps. First, local classifiers are built to
learn the local matching of each patch. Second, the hierarchical relationships
defined between local patches are used to learn the global matching of each
patch. Three ways are introduced to learn the global matching: majority voting,
l1-regularized weighting, and decision rule. Last, the global matchings of
different levels are combined as the final matching. Experimental results on
different face recognition tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
matcher at the cost of gallery generalization. Compared with the UR2D system,
the proposed matcher improves the Rank-1 accuracy significantly by 3% and 0.18%

such as that of the Council of the European Union. These aspects concern the
use of square-root weights and the choice of quota.
  Square-root weights originate in the Penrose square-root system, which
assumes that votes are cast independently and uniformly at random, and is based
around the concept of equality of influence of the voters across the Union.
There are (at least) two distinct definitions of influence in current use in
probability theory, namely, absolute and conditional influence. These are in
agreement when the underlying random variables are independent, but not
generally. We review their possible implications for two-tier voting systems,
especially in the context of the so-called collective bias model. We show that
the two square-root laws invoked by Penrose are unified through the use of
conditional influence.
  In an elaboration of the square-root system, Slomczynski and Zyczkowski have
proposed an exact value for the quota $q=q^*$ to be achieved in a successful
vote of a two-tier system, and they have presented numerical and theoretical
evidence in its support. We indicate some numerical and mathematical issues
arising in the use of a Gaussian (or normal) approximation in this context, and
we propose that other values of $q$ may be as good if not better than $q^*$. We
discuss certain aspects of the relationship between theoreticians and
politicians in the design of a two-tier voting system, and we reach the
conclusion that the choice of quota in the square-root system is an issue for
politicians informed by theory.

  Methods: All datapoints from consecutive 24-2 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were
extracted from a University of Washington database. Ten-fold cross validation
with a held out test set was used to develop the three main phases of model
development: model architecture selection, dataset combination selection, and
time-interval model training with transfer learning, to train a deep learning
artificial neural network capable of generating a point-wise visual field

  Results: More than 1.7 million perimetry points were extracted to the
hundredth decibel from 32,443 24-2 HVFs. The best performing model with 20
million trainable parameters, CascadeNet-5, was selected. The overall MAE for

  Conclusions: Using unfiltered real-world datasets, deep learning networks

the potential future circuit blocking probability between each node pair. These

the number of busy capacity units on each link at that instant. The candidate
route for serving a current service request is based on both the link loads and
the potential future blocking probability of the entire network in case this

  series of higher-order relativistic terms","18 pages, 1 figure","J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 30, 165801 (2018)","10.1088/1361-648X/aac5a2",,"cond-mat.other cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The phenomenological Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation of motion remains
as the cornerstone of contemporary magnetisation dynamics studies, wherein the
Gilbert damping parameter has been attributed to first-order relativistic
effects. To include magnetic inertial effects the LLG equation has previously
been extended with a supplemental inertia term and the arising inertial
dynamics has been related to second-order relativistic effects. Here we start
from the relativistic Dirac equation and, performing a Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation, derive a generalised Pauli spin Hamiltonian that contains
relativistic correction terms to any higher order. Using the Heisenberg
equation of spin motion we derive general relativistic expressions for the
tensorial Gilbert damping and magnetic inertia parameters, and show that these
tensors can be expressed as series of higher-order relativistic correction
terms. We further show that, in the case of a harmonic external driving field,
these series can be summed and we provide closed analytical expressions for the
Gilbert and inertial parameters that are functions of the frequency of the
driving field.

  Intelligent Text Processing, 2017",,,,"cs.SI cs.CL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging services in the world. The
great amount of information within Twitter makes it an important information
channel for people to learn and share news. Twitter hashtag is an popular
feature that can be viewed as human-labeled information which people use to
identify the topic of a tweet. Many researchers have proposed event-detection
approaches that can monitor Twitter data and determine whether special events,
such as accidents, extreme weather, earthquakes, or crimes take place. Although
many approaches use hashtags as one of their features, few of them explicitly
focus on the effectiveness of using hashtags on event detection. In this study,
we proposed an event detection approach that utilizes hashtags in tweets. We
adopted the feature extraction used in STREAMCUBE and applied a clustering
K-means approach to it. The experiments demonstrated that the K-means approach
performed better than STREAMCUBE in the clustering results. A discussion on
optimal K values for the K-means approach is also provided.
