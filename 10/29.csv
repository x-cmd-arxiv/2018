and Chriss (2001) define the optimal trading strategy to liquidate a fixed
volume of a single security under price uncertainty. Yet there exist
situations, such as in the power market, in which the volume to be traded can
only be estimated and becomes more accurate when approaching a specified
delivery time. During the course of execution, a trader should then constantly
adapt their trading strategy to meet their fluctuating volume target. In this
paper, we develop a model that accounts for volume uncertainty and we show that
a risk-averse trader has benefit in delaying their trades. More precisely, we
argue that the optimal strategy is a trade-off between early and late trades in
order to balance risk associated with both price and volume. By incorporating a
risk term related to the volume to trade, the static optimal strategies
suggested by our model avoid the explosion in the algorithmic complexity
usually associated with dynamic programming solutions, all the while yielding
competitive performance.

distribution of other distant bodies. This means that in the absence of other
bodies, a single body has no mass. In this case, talking about motion is not
possible, because the detection of motion is possible only relative to other
bodies. But in physics we are faced with situations that are not fully Machian.
As in the case of general theory of relativity where geodesics exist in the
absence of any matter, the motion has meaning. Another example which is the
main topic of our discussion, refers to Bohmian quantum mechanics, where the
inertial mass of a single particle does not vanish, but is modified. We can
call such situations in which motion or mass of a single particle has meaning,
pseudo-Machian situations. In this paper, we use the Machian or pseudo-Machian
considerations to clarify under what circumstances and how a Machian effect

since an efficient coupling requires the NV to be separated by only a few
microns away from the source. As a way to overcome this problem, an enhancement
of coherent coupling between NV centers and a microwave field has recently been
experimentally demonstrated using spin waves propagating in an adjacent yttrium

this coupling to the case when the spin waves are absent and the NV center is
driven only with the antenna field and show that the calculated coupling
enhancement is dramatic and agrees well with the one obtained in the recent

(TIR-MS) which supports the realization of structure-embedded subwavelength
acoustic shields for elastic waves propagating in thin waveguides. The proposed
metasurface design exploits extreme phase gradients, implemented via locally
resonant elements, in order to achieve operating conditions that are largely
beyond the critical angle. Such artificial discontinuity is capable of
producing complete reflection of the incoming waves regardless of the specific
angle of incidence. From a practical perspective, the TIR-MS behaves as a sound
hard barrier that is impenetrable to long-wavelength modes at a selected
frequency. The TIR metasurface concept is first conceived for a flat interface
embedded in a rectangular waveguide and designed to block longitudinal S0-type
guided modes. Then, it is extended to circular plates in order to show how
enclosed areas can be effectively shielded by incoming waves. Given the same
underlying physics, an equivalent dynamic behavior was also numerically and
experimentally illustrated for flexural A0-type guided modes. This study shows
numerical and experimental evidence that, when the metasurface is excited at
the target frequency, significant vibration isolation can be achieved in
presence of waves having any arbitrary angle of incidence. These results open
interesting paths to achieve vibration isolation and energy filtering in
certain prototypical structures of interest for practical engineering
applications.

match using descriptors. Furthermore, the number of matching points between FIR
images can be comparatively small, owing to the low resolution and lack of

estimates the scale parameter using batch optimization, based on the epipolar

forces among a system of discrete interacting grains. The approach is similar
to that used in structural analysis, but the stiffness matrix of granular
material is inherently non-symmetric because of the geometrics of particle
interactions and of the frictional behavior of the contacts. Internal geometric
constraints are imposed by the particles' shapes, in particular, by the surface
curvatures of the particles at their points of contact. Moreover, the stiffness
relationship is incrementally non-linear, and even small assemblies require the
analysis of multiple stiffness branches, with each branch region being a
pointed convex cone in displacement-space. These aspects of the particle-level
stiffness relationship gives rise to three types of micro-scale failure:
neutral equilibrium, bifurcation and path instability, and instability of
equilibrium. These three pathologies are defined in the context of four types
of displacement constraints, which can be readily analyzed with certain
generalized inverses. That is, instability and non-uniqueness are investigated
in the presence of kinematic constraints. Bifurcation paths can be either
stable or unstable, as determined with the Hill-Bazant-Petryk criterion.
Examples of simple granular systems of three, sixteen, and sixty four disks are
analyzed. With each system, multiple contacts were assumed to be at the
friction limit. Even with these small systems, micro-scale failure is expressed
in many different forms, with some systems having hundreds of micro-scale
failure modes. The examples suggest that micro-scale failure is pervasive
within granular materials, with particle arrangements being in a nearly
continual state of instability.

any string $S \in \Sigma^n$, symbol-by-symbol, with $I$ results in a string $S'

  Technology and Its Applications",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the inception of blockchain and Bitcoin (Nakamoto (2008)), a
decentralized-distributed ledger system and its associated cryptocurrency,
respectively, the world has witnessed a slew of newer adaptations and
applications. Although the original distributed ledger technology (DLT) of
blockchain is deemed secure and decentralized, the confirmation of transactions
is inefficient by design. Recently adopted, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based
distributed ledgers validate transactions efficiently without the physically
and environmentally costly building process of blocks (Lerner (2015)). However,
centrally-controlled confirmation against the odds of multiple validation
disqualifies the DAG as a decentralized-distributed ledger. In this regard, we
introduce an innovative DLT by reconstructing a chain of antichains based on a
given DAG-pool of transactions. Each antichain (box) contains distinct nodes
whose approved transactions are recursively validated by subsequently
augmenting nodes. The boxer node closes the box and keeps the hash of all
transactions confirmed by the box-genesis node. Designation of boxers and
box-geneses is conditionally randomized for decentralization. The boxes are
serially concatenated with recursive confirmation (boxchain) without incurring
the cost of box generation. Rewards (boxcoin) are paid to the contributing
nodes of the ecosystem whose trust is built on the doubly-secure protocol of
confirmation. A value-preserving medium of payment (boxdollar) is among
numerous practical applications discussed herein.

has a complex fermion determinant which precludes the use of standard
simulation methods based on importance sampling. Since, even when CLE
simulations converge, they are not guaranteed to produce correct results except
under very stringent conditions, which lattice QCD at finite $\mu$ does not
obey, we need extensive testing to determine under what conditions it produces
reliable results. We performed simulations at $\beta=6/g^2=5.6$ and
$\beta=5.7$, both at $m=0.025$. For small $\mu$ and $\mu$ large enough to
produce saturation, measured observables appear to be approaching their correct
values as the coupling is decreased. However, for intermediate $\mu$ values,
these simulations predict a transition from hadronic to nuclear matter at a
$\mu$ which is far too small. Since there is evidence that for CLE simulations
to produce correct results the trajectories should remain close to the $SU(3)$
manifold (at least for small $\mu$), we explore the parameter space to see
where this is true. We find that the distance from this manifold decreases as
the coupling decreases and as the quark mass (in lattice units) decreases, i.e.
as we approach the continuum limit. This indicates that we need to simulate at
smaller couplings and quark masses (requiring larger lattices) to see if these

matrices fusion relations, we prove that our SoV basis indeed separates the
spectrum of the corresponding transfer matrices. Moreover, the combined use of
the fusion rules, of the known analytic properties of the transfer matrices and
of the SoV basis allows us to obtain the complete characterization of the
transfer matrix spectrum and to prove its simplicity. Any transfer matrix
eigenvalue is completely characterized as a solution of a so-called quantum
spectral curve equation that we obtain as a difference functional equation of

this equation having prescribed properties leads to an eigenvalue. We construct
the associated eigenvector, unique up to normalization, by computing its
decomposition on the SoV basis that is of a factorized form written in terms of
the powers of the corresponding eigenvalues. If the twist matrix K is
diagonalizable with simple spectrum then the transfer matrix is also
diagonalizable with simple spectrum. In that case, we give a construction of

body generated by a given set in ${\mathbb E}^d$ is the intersection of balls
of radius $r$ centered at the points of the given set. In this paper we prove
the following Blaschke-Santal\'o-type inequalities for $r$-ball bodies: for all
$1\leq k\leq d$ and for any set of given volume in ${\mathbb E}^d$ the $k$-th
intrinsic volume of the $r$-ball body generated by the set becomes maximal if
the set is a ball. As an application we investigate the Gromov-Klee-Wagon
problem for congruent balls in ${\mathbb E}^d$, which is a question on proving
or disproving that if the centers of a family of $N$ congruent balls in
${\mathbb E}^d$ are contracted, then the volume of the intersection does not
decrease. In particular, we investigate this problem for uniform contractions,
which are contractions where all the pairwise distances in the first set of
centers are larger than all the pairwise distances in the second set of
centers, that is, when the pairwise distances of the two sets are separated by
some positive real number. The author and M. Nasz\'odi [Discrete Comput. Geom.
60/4 (2018), 967-980] proved that the intrinsic volumes of the intersection of
$N$ congruent balls in ${\mathbb E}^d$, $d>1$ increase under any uniform
contraction of the center points when $ N\geq \left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^d$. We
give a short proof of this result using the Blaschke-Santal\'o-type
inequalities of $r$-ball bodies and improve it for $d\geq 42$.

validate a method that overcomes this obstacle. Rapidly propagating shear
fronts are generated and used to establish well-controlled local stress

confidentiality must be protected over decades or even centuries. While there
is a vast amount of cryptography-based data protection schemes, only few are
designed for long-term protection. Recently, Braun et al. (AsiaCCS'17) proposed
the first long-term protection scheme that provides renewable integrity
protection and information-theoretic confidentiality protection. However,
computation and storage costs of their scheme increase significantly with the
number of stored data items. As a result, their scheme appears suitable only
for protecting databases with a small number of relatively large data items,
but unsuitable for databases that hold a large number of relatively small data
items (e.g., medical record databases). In this work, we present a solution for
efficient long-term integrity and confidentiality protection of large datasets
consisting of relatively small data items. First, we construct a renewable
vector commitment scheme that is information-theoretically hiding under
selective decommitment. We then combine this scheme with renewable timestamps
and information-theoretically secure secret sharing. The resulting solution
requires only a single timestamp for protecting a dataset while the state of
the art requires a number of timestamps linear in the number of data items. We
implemented our solution and measured its performance in a scenario where 12
000 data items are aggregated, stored, protected, and verified over a time span
of 100 years. Our measurements show that our new solution completes this
evaluation scenario an order of magnitude faster than the state of the art.

Early diagnosis and precise treatment are essential for ASD patients. Although
researchers have built many analytical models, there has been limited progress

build an accurate model to predict treatment outcome and ASD severity from
early stage functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The difficulty
in building large databases of patients who have received specific treatments
and the high dimensionality of medical image analysis problems are challenges
in this work. We propose a generic and accurate two-level approach for
high-dimensional regression problems in medical image analysis. First, we
perform region-level feature selection using a predefined brain parcellation.
Based on the assumption that voxels within one region in the brain have similar
values, for each region we use the bootstrapped mean of voxels within it as a
feature. In this way, the dimension of data is reduced from number of voxels to
number of regions. Then we detect predictive regions by various feature
selection methods. Second, we extract voxels within selected regions, and
perform voxel-level feature selection. To use this model in both linear and
non-linear cases with limited training examples, we apply two-level elastic net
regression and random forest (RF) models respectively. To validate accuracy and
robustness of this approach, we perform experiments on both task-fMRI and
resting state fMRI datasets. Furthermore, we visualize the influence of each
region, and show that the results match well with other findings.

irregularities of the filler grains' surfaces, etc.), the layers are assumed to

original many-particle (compact-group) approach which, however, avoids an
in-depth elaboration of polarization and correlation processes. The result is
expressed through the electrical and geometrical parameters of the

describes the effective conductivity as a function of the filler concentration

this relation is valid in the time-homogeneous case, while it fails in the
time-periodic case. The latter is relevant for the study of several small
thermodynamic systems. We consider here a time-periodic Markov chain with
continuous time and a broad class of functionals of stochastic trajectories,
which are general linear combinations of the empirical flow and the empirical
density. Inspired by the analysis done in our previous work [1], we provide
general methods to get local quadratic bounds for large deviations, which lead
to universal lower bounds on the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the
squared average value in terms of suitable universal rates, independent of the
empirical functional. These bounds are called ""generalized thermodynamic
uncertainty relations"" (GTUR's), being generalized versions of the
thermodynamic uncertainty relation to the time-periodic case and to functionals
which are more general than currents. Previously, GTUR's in the time-periodic
case have been obtained in [1, 27, 42]. Here we recover the GTUR's in [1, 27]
and produce new ones, leading to even stronger bounds and also to new trade-off
relations for time-homogeneous systems. Moreover, we generalize to arbitrary

generalize to the time-periodic case the GTUR obtained in [19] for the so
called dynamical activity, and provide a new GTUR which, in the

For the graph sampling step, we exploit parallelism within and across multiple

accesses that provides theoretical guarantee of near-linear speedup with number
of processing units. For the feature propagation step within the sampled graph,
we improve cache utilization and reduce DRAM communication by data
partitioning. We prove that our partitioning strategy is a 2-approximation for
minimizing the communication time compared to the optimal strategy. We
demonstrate that our parallel graph embedding outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in scalability (with respect to number of processors, graph size and
GCN model size), efficiency and accuracy on several large datasets. On a
40-core Xeon platform, our parallel training achieves $64\times$ speedup (with

Artists preferentially sample drum breaks, and previous studies have suggested
that these may be culturally transmitted. With the advent of digital sampling
technologies and social media the modes of cultural transmission may have
shifted, and music communities may have become decoupled from geography. The
aim of the current study was to determine whether drum breaks are culturally
transmitted through musical collaboration networks, and to identify the factors
driving the evolution of these networks. Using network-based diffusion analysis
we found strong evidence for the cultural transmission of drum breaks via
collaboration between artists, and identified several demographic variables
that bias transmission. Additionally, using network evolution methods we found
evidence that the structure of the collaboration network is no longer biased by
geographic proximity after the year 2000, and that gender disparity has relaxed
over the same period. Despite the delocalization of communities by the
internet, collaboration remains a key transmission mode of music sampling
traditions. The results of this study provide valuable insight into how
demographic biases shape cultural transmission in complex networks, and how the
evolution of these networks has shifted in the digital age.

energy-optimal yet reliability and hardware compliant conditions for limiting

constraints, the common notion---higher $M$-ary QAM modulations are energy
optimal for short-range communication---prevails, and can provide up to 180%

generalize well to the test data. In this paper, we focus on $\ell_\infty$
attacks, and study the adversarially robust generalization problem through the
lens of Rademacher complexity. For binary linear classifiers, we prove tight
bounds for the adversarial Rademacher complexity, and show that the adversarial
Rademacher complexity is never smaller than its natural counterpart, and it has
an unavoidable dimension dependence, unless the weight vector has bounded
$\ell_1$ norm. The results also extend to multi-class linear classifiers. For

adversarial Rademacher complexity also exists. We further consider a surrogate
adversarial loss for one-hidden layer ReLU network and prove margin bounds for
this setting. Our results indicate that having $\ell_1$ norm constraints on the
weight matrices might be a potential way to improve generalization in the
adversarial setting. We demonstrate experimental results that validate our

expansion history of the universe. Peculiar velocity induces the LDS
distortion, analogous to the redshift space distortion, and allows for a new

($1+z=D_L/D^{\rm co}_A$), the LDS LSS by itself determines the redshift to
$\sim 1\%$ level accuracy, and alleviates the need of spectroscopic follow-up
of GW events.But a more valuable application is to test the distance duality to
$1\%$ level accuracy, in combination with conventional BAO and supernovae

antigenic novelty fast enough to evade the adaptive immunity of the host

dynamical state is often compared to the Red Queen evolving as fast as it can
just to maintain its foothold in the host population: Accumulation of antigenic
novelty is balanced by the build-up of host immunity. Such Red Queen States
(RQS) of continuous adaptation in large rapidly mutating populations are well
understood in terms of Traveling Wave (TW) theories of population genetics.
Here we shall make explicit the mapping of the established Multi-strain
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model onto the TW theory and demonstrate
that a pathogen can persist in RQS if cross-immunity is long-ranged and its
population size is large populations allowing for rapid adaptation. We then
investigate the stability of this state focusing on the rate of extinction and
the rate of ""speciation"" defined as antigenic divergence of viral strains
beyond the range of cross-inhibition. RQS states are transient, but in a
certain range of evolutionary parameters can exist for the time long compared
to the typical time to the most recent common ancestor ($T_{MRCA}$). In this
range the steady TW is unstable and the antigenic advance of the lead strains
relative to the typical co-circulating viruses tends to oscillate. This results
in large fluctuations in prevalence that facilitate extinction. We shall
demonstrate that the rate of TW fission into antigenically uncoupled viral
populations is related to fluctuations of $T_{MRCA}$ and construct a ""phase

challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id,

prediction relies on high-order combinatorial features (\textit{a.k.a.} cross
features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and
are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding
low-dimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features
and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and
efficient method called the \emph{AutoInt} to automatically learn the
high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is
very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input
features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into
the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multi-head self-attentive neural
network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature
interactions in the low-dimensional space. With different layers of the
multi-head self-attentive neural networks, different orders of feature
combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be
efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental

quantum systems, which may not be known in advance. In this paper, we propose a
gradient algorithm for identifying the correlations in terms of time-varying
damping rate functions in a time-convolution-less master equation for spin
chains. By measuring time trace observables of the system, the identification
procedure can be formulated as an optimization problem. The gradient algorithm
is designed based on a calculation of the derivative of an objective function
with respect to the damping rate functions, whose effectiveness is shown in a
comparison to a differential approach for a two-qubit spin chain.

select quasars at $5.3 < z < 5.7$ using conventional color selections, due to
their similar optical colors to those of late-type stars, especially M dwarfs.
We developed a new selection technique for $z \sim$ 5.5 quasars based on
optical, near-IR, and mid-IR photometry, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), PanSTARR1 (PS1), the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Surveys - Large

propagation and global sensitivity analysis. In case A, stochastic variation is
introduced in the two non-dimensional parameters (Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers)
with an assumption that the boundary temperature is uniform. Being a two
dimensional stochastic problem, the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method is
used as a surrogate model. Case B deals with non-uniform stochasticity in the
boundary temperature. Instead of the traditional Gaussian process model with
the Karhunen-Lo$\grave{e}$ve expansion, a novel approach is successfully
implemented to model uncertainty in the boundary condition. The boundary is
divided into multiple domains and the temperature imposed on each domain is
assumed to be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random
variable. Deep neural networks are trained with the boundary temperatures as
inputs and Nusselt number, internal temperature or velocities as outputs. The
number of domains which is essentially the stochastic dimension is 4, 8, 16 or
32. Rigorous training and testing process shows that the neural network is able
to approximate the outputs to a reasonable accuracy. For a high stochastic
dimension such as 32, it is computationally expensive to fit the PCE. This
paper demonstrates a novel way of using the deep neural network as a surrogate
modeling method for uncertainty quantification with the number of simulations
much fewer than that required for fitting the PCE, thus, saving the
computational cost.

show systematically evolving Na I absorption line by performing a systematic

modeled in terms of photoionization model, with the location of the gas clouds

infrastructures such as banking/finance, transportation and utility management.
Sophistication and resources used in recent security breaches including those
on critical infrastructures show that attackers are no longer limited by
monetary/computational constraints. In fact, they may be aided by entities with
large financial and human resources. Hence there is urgent need to develop
predictive approaches for cyber defense to strengthen cloud infrastructures
specifically utilized by critical infrastructures. Extensive research has been
done in the past on applying techniques such as Game Theory, Machine Learning
and Bayesian Networks among others for the predictive defense of critical
infrastructures. However a major drawback of these approaches is that they do
not incorporate probabilistic human behavior which limits their predictive
ability. In this paper, a stochastic approach is proposed to predict less
secure states in critical cloud systems which might lead to potential security
breaches. These less-secure states are deemed as `risky' states in our
approach. Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to accurately incorporate user
behavior(s) as well as operational behavior of the cloud infrastructure through
a set of features. The developed reward/cost mechanism is then used to select
appropriate `actions' to identify risky states at future time steps by learning
an optimal policy. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
performs well in identifying future `risky' states. Through this work we
demonstrate the effectiveness of using probabilistic modeling (MDP) to
predictively secure critical cloud infrastructures.

LNSD experiments are in strong tension with the exclusion limit from the
IceCube experiment. Recently it has been claimed that by considering the
non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in addition to the sterile neutrino,
the IceCube's limit can be relaxed and the tension can be reconciled; a baroque
scenario as it has been called. We will show that this claim is just an
artifact originating from the energy cuts of the chosen datasets. Contrary to
the claim, by turning on the NSI and fixing the NSI parameters to the proposed
values, not only the IceCube's limit on sterile neutrino cannot be alleviated,
but in fact the tension will be aggravated. The reconciliation, more
appropriately, can be called surreal.

proposed for solving (PM) in literature. In the first part of this paper, we
show that the bisection algorithm can be greatly improved by reducing the

that the bisection method cannot guarantee to find the globally optimal

main contribution of this paper is to propose an efficient branch-and-bound

parametric function evaluations at the two endpoints. We can show that the new
algorithm(BTD Algorithm) returns a global \epsilon-approximation solution in a

optimization algorithm performs even much faster than the improved version of

steganography in a single object. In practice, one may face a complex scenario
where one or some of multiple users also called actors are guilty of using
steganography, which is defined as the steganographer identification problem
(SIP). This requires steganalysis experts to design effective and robust
detection algorithms to identify the guilty actor(s). The mainstream works use
clustering, ensemble and anomaly detection, where distances in high dimensional
space between features of actors are determined to find out the outlier(s)

points could be sparse such that distances between feature points may become
relatively similar to each other, which cannot benefit the detection. Moreover,
it is well-known in machine learning that combining techniques such as boosting
and bagging can be effective in improving detection performance. This motivates
the authors in this paper to present a feature bagging approach to SIP. The
proposed work merges results from multiple detection sub-models, each of which
feature space is randomly sampled from the raw full dimensional space. We
create a new dataset called ImgNetEase including 5108 images downloaded from a

introducing a prediction error of the learned governing equation for the

related to evidence propagation in a Bayesian network for which it is useful to
know which acyclic digraphs have their moral graphs being chordal (phylogeny

  In this paper, we extend their work. We completely characterize phylogeny
graphs of $(1, i)$ digraphs and $(i,1)$ digraphs, respectively, for a positive

worthwhile in the context that a child has two biological parents in most

exhibit quite distinct dispersions for both cases, in particular the spin wave
is gapless for the Chern Hubbard model, while gapped for the $Z_2$ Hubbard

introduces dips in the lower boundary of the Stoner continuum. It significantly
renormalizes the energies of the spin waves around these dips downward and
leads to roton-like spin excitations. We elaborate that it is the softening of
the roton-like modes that destabilizes the ferromagnetic phase, and determine
the parameter region where the ferromagnetic phase is stable.

we employ direct numerical simulation by solving the Navier-Stokes equations

characterized by an improved index to capture small microstructural

focus on the residual volume and morphological characteristics of saturated
zones after drainage and compare the effect of disorder under different

highly-disordered porous medium is favourable to improve liquid retention and
provide various morphologies of entrapped saturated zones. Furthermore, the

structure of the Lloyd's mirror pattern by generating a sequence of pulses
(rahmonics) located at the fundamental quefrency (periodic time) and its
multiples. This sequence is referred to here as the `rahmonic component' of the
power cepstrum. The fundamental quefrency, which is the reciprocal of the
frequency difference between adjacent interference fringes, equates to the

non-rahmonic (extraneous) component, which combines with the rahmonic component
to form the (total) power cepstrum. A data processing technique, termed
`cepstrum subtraction', is described. This technique suppresses the extraneous
component of the power cepstrum, leaving the rahmonic component that contains
the desired multipath time delay information. This technique is applied to real
acoustic recordings of motor-vessel transits in a shallow water environment,
where the broadband noise radiated by the vessel arrives at the hydrophone via
a direct ray path and a time-delayed multipath. The results show that cepstrum

suffers from spectral variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to
accurately estimate abundance maps. The classical unmixing model, the linear
mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To
this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented
linear mixing model (ALMM), to address spectral variability by applying a
data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing.
The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling
factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by
means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities
caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity,
atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), as
well as material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral
variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy,
we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability
dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures
of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low coherence dictionary learning
problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of
spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability
dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with
previous state-of-the-art methods.

by expanding in the limit of small external masses. This provides a
systematically improvable approximation to the integrals in the entire phase
space, and works particularly well for the high energy tails of kinematic
distributions (where the usual $1/M$ expansions cease to be valid). We
demonstrate our method using Higgs boson pair production as an example. We find
that at both one-loop and two-loop, our method provides good approximations to
the integrals appearing in the scattering amplitudes. Comparing to existing
expansion methods, our method are not restricted to a special phase space
region. Combining our efficient method to compute the two-loop amplitude with
an infrared subtraction method for the real emission corrections, we expect to
have a fast and reliable tool to calculate the differential cross sections for
Higgs boson pair production. This will be useful for phenomenological studies
and for the extraction of the Higgs self-coupling from future experimental
data. Our method can also be applied to other processes, such as the associated
production of the Higgs boson with a jet or a $Z$ boson.

play an important role in many astrophysical processes due to its dominant
surface area, including gas heating, chemistry, star formation , and anomalous
microwave emission. In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are
present, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain
shattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether
these nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how
to constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we
present a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on
centrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic
atomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to
supersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be
spun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic
neutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating
nanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material
($S_{\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than
$a\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\max}\sim 10^{9}\erg\cm^{-3}$. The proposed disruption
mechanism is shown to be more efficient than thermal sputtering in controlling
the lower cutoff of grain size distribution in C-shocks. We model microwave
emission from spinning nanoparticles in C-shocks subject to supersonic neutral
drift and rotational disruption. We find that suprathermally rotating
nanoparticles can emit strong microwave radiation, and both peak flux and peak
frequency increase with increasing the shock velocity. We suggest spinning dust
as a new method to constrain nanoparticles and trace shock velocities in dense,
shocked regions.

contact with the neuronal membrane, free in the cytoplasm and internalized
through the endolysosomal pathway, with no significant impact on neuron
viability. However, GO exposure selectively caused the inhibition of excitatory
transmission, paralleled by a reduction in the number of excitatory synaptic
contacts, and a concomitant enhancement of the inhibitory activity. This was
accompanied by induction of autophagy, altered Ca2+ dynamics and by a
downregulation of some of the main players in the regulation of Ca2+

including both hydrodynamics and thermal fluctuations. Its main use concerns
complex fluids, where the solvent interacts with concentrated solutes, may they
be colloidal particles, polymers or electrolytes. A key difficulty concerns the
way one couples the fluid to the solute particles, without losing the key
advantages of the MPCD method in term of computational efficiency. In this
paper, we investigate the dynamical properties of solutes that are coupled to
the fluid within the collision step, {\em i.e.} when local momentum exchange
between fluid particles occurs. We quantify how the volume where momentum
exchange is performed (the size of the collision cells) constrains the
hydrodynamic size of the solute. Moreover, we show that this volume should be
taken smaller than the structural size of the solutes. Within these
constraints, we find that the hydrodynamic properties of a 1-1 electrolyte
solution are similar to the behaviour predicted by the Fuoss-Onsager theory of
electrolyte dynamics, and we quantify the limitations of the theory for 2-1 and
2-2 electrolytes. However, it is also clear that mapping the diffusion time
scale to that of a real system cannot be done quantitatively with this
methodology.

three-dimensional structures of various proteins are solved on a routine basis.
A large portion of these contain structural repetitions or internal symmetries.
To understand the evolution mechanisms of these proteins and how structural
repetitions affect the protein function, we need to be able to detect such
proteins very robustly. As deep learning is particularly suited to deal with
spatially organized data, we applied it to the detection of proteins with
structural repetitions. Results: We present DeepSymmetry, a versatile method
based on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional networks that detects structural
repetitions in proteins and their density maps. Our method is designed to
identify tandem repeat proteins, proteins with internal symmetries, symmetries
in the raw density maps, their symmetry order, and also the corresponding
symmetry axes. Detection of symmetry axes is based on learning six-dimensional
Veronese mappings of 3D vectors, and the median angular error of axis
determination is less than one degree. We demonstrate the capabilities of our
method on benchmarks with tandem repeated proteins and also with symmetrical
assemblies. For example, we have discovered over 10,000 putative tandem repeat
proteins that are not currently present in the RepeatsDB database.
Availability: The method is available at
https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/deepsymmetry. It consists of a C++
executable that transforms molecular structures into volumetric density maps,
and a Python code based on the TensorFlow framework for applying the
DeepSymmetry model to these maps.

  Interactions Modeling",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommendation is crucial in both academia and industry, and various
techniques are proposed such as content-based collaborative filtering, matrix
factorization, logistic regression, factorization machines, neural networks and
multi-armed bandits. However, most of the previous studies suffer from two
limitations: (1) considering the recommendation as a static procedure and
ignoring the dynamic interactive nature between users and the recommender
systems, (2) focusing on the immediate feedback of recommended items and
neglecting the long-term rewards. To address the two limitations, in this paper
we propose a novel recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement
learning, called DRR. The DRR framework treats recommendation as a sequential
decision making procedure and adopts an ""Actor-Critic"" reinforcement learning
scheme to model the interactions between the users and recommender systems,
which can consider both the dynamic adaptation and long-term rewards.
Furthermore, a state representation module is incorporated into DRR, which can
explicitly capture the interactions between items and users. Three
instantiation structures are developed. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets are conducted under both the offline and online evaluation
settings. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed DRR method indeed
outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

the quantum version of a simple and exactly solvable model of deterministic
chaos that caricatures the action of kneading dough. Exact solutions based on
the semiquantum approximation are derived that tracks very well the correlators
till the Ehrenfest time. The growth occurs at the exponential rate of the
classical Lyapunov exponent, but modulated by slowly changing coefficients.
Beyond this time saturation occurs as a value close to that of random matrices.
Using projectors for observables naturally leads to truncations of the unitary
time-$t$ propagator and the growth of their singular values is shown to be
intimately related to the growth of the out-of-time-ordered correlators.

(MCs) is difficult because of the high stellar density in these fields.
Although the first AGN behind the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were reported in
the 1980s, it is only recently that the number of AGN known behind the SMC has
increased by several orders of magnitude. Aims: The mid-infrared colour
selection technique has been proven to be an efficient means of identifying
AGN, especially obscured sources. The X-ray regime is complementary in this
regard and we use XMM-Newton observations to support the identification of AGN
behind the SMC. Methods: We present a catalogue of AGN behind the SMC by
correlating an updated X-ray point source catalogue from our XMM-Newton survey
of the SMC with already known AGN from the literature as well as a list of
candidates obtained from the ALLWISE mid-infrared colour selection criterion.
We studied the properties of the sample with respect to their redshifts,
luminosities and X-ray spectral characteristics. We also identified the
near-infrared counterpart of the sources from the VISTA observations. Results:
The redshift and luminosity distributions of the sample (where known) indicate
that we detect sources from nearby Seyfert galaxies to distant and obscured
quasars. The X-ray hardness ratios are compatible with those typically expected
for AGN. The VISTA colours and variability are also consistent in this regard.
A positive correlation was observed between the integrated X-ray flux (0.2--12
keV) and the ALLWISE and VISTA magnitudes. We further present a sample of new
candidate AGN and candidates for obscured AGN. All of these make an interesting
subset for further follow-up studies. An initial spectroscopic follow-up of 6
out of the 81 new candidates showed all six sources are active galaxies, albeit
two with narrow emission lines.

mechanics co\-mmon\-ly require a large number of structural degrees of freedom.
Additionally, these models are often coupled with lumped-parameter models of
hemodynamics. High computational demands, however, slow down model calibration
and therefore limit the use of cardiac simulations in clinical practice. As
cardiac models rely on several patient-specific parameters, just one solution
corresponding to one specific parameter set does not at all meet clinical
demands. Moreover, while solving the nonlinear problem, 90\% of the computation
time is spent solving linear systems of equations. We propose a novel approach
to reduce only the structural dimension of the monolithically coupled
structure-windkessel system by projection onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We
obtain a good approximation of the displacement field as well as of key scalar
cardiac outputs even with very few reduced degrees of freedom while achieving
considerable speedups. For subspace generation, we use proper orthogonal
decomposition of displacement snapshots. To incorporate changes in the
parameter set into our reduced order model, we provide a comparison of subspace
interpolation methods. We further show how projection-based model order
reduction can be easily integrated into a gradient-based optimization and
demonstrate its performance in a real-world multivariate inverse analysis
scenario. Using the presented projection-based model order reduction approach
can significantly speed up model personalization and could be used for
many-query tasks in a clinical setting.

billions of heterogeneous devices by various manufacturers. To enable IoT
applications, the communication between IoT devices follows specifications
defined by standard developing organizations. In this paper, we present a case
study that investigates disclosed insecurities of the popular IoT standard
ZigBee, and derive general lessons about security economics in IoT
standardization efforts. We discuss the motivation of IoT standardization
efforts that are primarily driven from an economic perspective, in which large
investments in security are not considered necessary since the consumers do not
reward them. Success at the market is achieved by being quick-to-market,
providing functional features and offering easy integration for complementors.
Nevertheless, manufacturers should not only consider economic reasons but also
see their responsibility to protect humans and technological infrastructures
from being threatened by insecure IoT products. In this context, we propose a
number of recommendations to strengthen the security design in future IoT
standardization efforts, ranging from the definition of a precise security
model to the enforcement of an update policy.

control fidelity of Si/SiGe spin qubits can be limited by the microwave-induced
frequency shift of electric dipole spin resonance and it can be improved by
optimization of control pulses. As we increase the control microwave amplitude,
we observe a shift of the qubit resonance frequency, in addition to the

superconductivity and Majorana zero modes induced by a magnetic field in hybrid
proximity structures. This paper proposes a realization of topological
superconductivity in a short Josephson junction at an edge of a 2D topological
insulator subject to a perpendicular magnetic field. The magnetic field effect
is entirely orbital, coming from a gradient of the order parameter phase at the
edge, which results in a soliton defect at the junction with a pair of gapless
Andreev bound states. The latter are reducible to Majorana zero modes by a
unitary rotation and protected by a chiral symmetry. Furthermore, both ground
state and excitations are quasiperiodic in the magnetic flux enclosed in the
junction, with the period equal to the double flux quantum $2\Phi_0 = h/e$.
This behaviour follows from the gauge invariance of the $4\pi$ - phase
periodicity of the Majorana states and manifests itself as $2\Phi_0$ - spaced
magnetic oscillations of the critical current. Another proposed observable is a
persistent current occurring in the absence of an external phase bias. Beside
the oscillations, it shows a sign reversal prompted by the neutral Majorana
zero modes. These findings offer the possibility to access topological
superconductivity through low-field dc magnetotransport measurements.

many different input types, the paper introduces a novel two-pivot variant of
Lomuto's partitioning scheme. A surprisingly simple twist to the generic
two-pivot quicksort approach makes the algorithm robust. The paper provides an
analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms and compares
them to their competitors. The analysis shows that Lomuto-based approaches
incur a higher average sorting cost than the Hoare-based approach of
BlockQuicksort. Moreover, the analysis is particularly useful to reason about

appearance of quantum-coherent many-body phenomena, and much effort is often

realized that driven-dissipative dynamics could be used as a resource. By
proper engineering of the reservoirs and their couplings to a system, one may
drive the system towards desired quantum-correlated steady states, even in the
absence of internal Hamiltonian dynamics. An intriguing category of equilibrium
many-particle phases are those which are distinguished by topology rather than
by symmetry. A natural question thus arises: which of these topological states
can be achieved as the result of dissipative Lindblad-type (Markovian)
evolution? Beside its fundamental importance, it may offer novel routes to the
realization of topologically-nontrivial states in quantum simulators,
especially ultracold atomic gases. Here I give a general answer for Gaussian
states and quadratic Lindblad evolution, mostly concentrating on the example of
2D Chern insulator states. I prove a no-go theorem stating that a finite-range
Lindbladian cannot induce finite-rate exponential decay towards a unique
topological pure state above 1D. I construct a recipe for creating such state
by exponentially-local dynamics, or a mixed state arbitrarily close to the
desired pure one via finite-range dynamics. I also address the cold-atom
realization, classification, and detection of these states. Extensions to other
types of topological insulators and superconductors are also discussed.

model showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a
theoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation.
We show that the difference in surface activation patterns is a direct
consequence of the thickness of the discrete network of heart muscle cells
through which electrical signals percolate to reach the imaged surface. The
model naturally follows the clinical spectrum of AF spanning sinus rhythm,
paroxysmal and persistent AF as the decoupling of myocardial cells results in
the lattice approaching the percolation threshold. This allows the model to
make additional predictions beyond the current clinical understanding, showing
that for paroxysmal AF re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium, but in
persistent AF they emerge deeper in the bulk of the atrial wall where
endocardial ablation is less effective. If clinically confirmed, this may
explain the lower success rate of ablation in long-lasting persistent AF.

  In this paper, we focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are
multi-layer networks widely used in natural language processing. They are
harder to analyze than feedforward neural networks, because the $\textit{same}$
recurrent unit is repeatedly applied across the entire time horizon of length
$L$, which is analogous to feedforward networks of depth $L$. We show when the
number of neurons is sufficiently large, meaning polynomial in the training

the linear convergence rate. This gives theoretical evidence of how RNNs can
memorize data.

multi-layer networks with ReLU activations. For instance, we prove why ReLU
activations can prevent exponential gradient explosion or vanishing, and build
a perturbation theory to analyze first-order approximation of multi-layer

with finite standard error. The use of pseudo-comparisons also has a
regularization effect, shrinking the estimated parameters towards equal item

a method to compute quasi standard errors for the item parameters. This
provides the basis for comparison intervals that do not change with the choice

emerged field of all-dielectric nanophotonics employs optically induced
electric and magnetic Mie resonances in dielectric nanoparticles with a high
refractive index. This property allows obtaining additional valuable degrees of
freedom to control optical responses of nanophotonic structures. Here we
propose a conceptually distinct approach towards reaching optical resonances in
dielectric nanoparticles. We show that lacking conventional Mie resonances,
low-index nanoparticles can exhibit a novel anisotropy-induced family of
non-Mie eigenmodes. Specifically, we investigate light interactions with
calcite and vaterite nanospheres and compare them with the Mie scattering by a
fused silica sphere. Having close permittivities and same dimensions, these
particles exhibit significantly different scattering behavior owing to their
internal structure. While a fused silica sphere does not demonstrate any
spectral features, the uniaxial structure of the permittivity tensor for
calcite and non-diagonal permittivity tensor for vaterite result in a set of
distinguishable peaks in scattering spectra. Multipole decomposition and
eigenmode analysis reveal that these peaks are associated with a new family of
electric and magnetic resonances. We identify magnetic dipole modes of
ordinary, extraordinary and hybrid polarization as well as complex electric
dipole resonances, featuring a significant toroidal electric dipole moment. As
both vaterite and calcite are biominerals, naturally synthesized and exploited
by a variety of living organisms, our results provide an indispensable toolbox

The spread of $G$ is the
largest integer $k$ such that for any nontrivial elements $x_1, \ldots, x_k$,
there exists $y \in G$ such that $G = \langle x_i, y\rangle$ for all $i$. The
more restrictive notion of uniform spread, denoted $u(G)$, requires $y$ to be
chosen from a fixed conjugacy class of $G$, and a theorem of Breuer, Guralnick
and Kantor states that $u(G) \geqslant 2$ for every non-abelian finite simple
group $G$. For any group with $u(G) \geqslant 1$, we define the uniform
domination number $\gamma_u(G)$ of $G$ to be the minimal size of a subset $S$
of conjugate elements such that for each nontrivial $x \in G$ there exists $y
\in S$ with $G = \langle x, y \rangle$ (in this situation, we say that $S$ is a
uniform dominating set for $G$). We introduced the latter notion in a recent
paper, where we used probabilistic methods to determine close to best possible
bounds on $\gamma_u(G)$ for all simple groups $G$.
  In this paper we establish several new results on the spread, uniform spread
and uniform domination number of finite groups and finite simple groups. For
example, we make substantial progress towards a classification of the simple
groups $G$ with $\gamma_u(G)=2$, and we study the associated probability that
two randomly chosen conjugate elements form a uniform dominating set for $G$.
We also establish new results concerning the $2$-generation of soluble and
symmetric groups, and we present several open problems.

Gaifman, Barthelmann and Schwentick showed in 1999 that every first-order
formula is equivalent to a formula of the shape $\exists x_1 \dotsc \exists x_k
\forall y\,\phi$ where quantification in $\phi$ is relativised to elements of
distance $\leq r$ from $y$. Such a formula will be called
Barthelmann-Schwentick normal form (BSNF) in the following. However, although
the proof is effective, it leads to a non-elementary blow-up of the BSNF in
terms of the size of the original formula.
  We show that, if equivalence on the class of all structures, or even only
finite forests, is required, this non-elementary blow-up is indeed unavoidable.
We then examine restricted classes of structures where more efficient
algorithms are possible. In this direction, we show that on any class of
structures of degree $\leq 2$, BSNF can be computed in 2-fold exponential time
with respect to the size of the input formula. And for any class of structures
of degree $\leq d$ for some $d\geq 3$, this is possible in 3-fold exponential
time. For both cases, we provide matching lower bounds.

students are educated and human civilization can be inherited and advanced. A
good teacher not only provides his/her students with qualified teaching
materials (e.g., textbooks), but also sets up appropriate learning objectives
(e.g., course projects and exams) considering different situations of a
student. When it comes to artificial intelligence, treating machine learning
models as students, the loss functions that are optimized act as perfect
counterparts of the learning objective set by the teacher. In this work, we
explore the possibility of imitating human teaching behaviors by dynamically
and automatically outputting appropriate loss functions to train machine
learning models. Different from typical learning settings in which the loss
function of a machine learning model is predefined and fixed, in our framework,
the loss function of a machine learning model (we call it student) is defined
by another machine learning model (we call it teacher). The ultimate goal of
teacher model is cultivating the student to have better performance measured on
development dataset. Towards that end, similar to human teaching, the teacher,
a parametric model, dynamically outputs different loss functions that will be
used and optimized by its student model at different training stages. We
develop an efficient learning method for the teacher model that makes gradient
based optimization possible, exempt of the ineffective solutions such as policy
optimization. We name our method as ""learning to teach with dynamic loss

including image classification and neural machine translation demonstrate that
our method significantly improves the quality of various student models.

result in poor reconstructions or manual selection of the images that will be
used to deblur. Automatically selecting best frames within the burst to improve
the base reconstruction is challenging because the amount of possible images
fusions is equal to the power set cardinal. Here, we approach the multi-image
deblurring problem as a two steps process. First, we successfully learn a
comparison function to rank a burst of images using a deep convolutional neural
network. Then, an incremental Fourier burst accumulation with a reconstruction
degradation mechanism is applied fusing only less blurred images that are
sufficient to maximize the reconstruction quality. Experiments with the

very challenging on real data due to the prevalence of dirty values. The
state-of-the-art solutions for ER were built on a variety of learning models
(most notably deep neural networks), which require lots of accurately labeled
training data. Unfortunately, high-quality labeled data usually require
expensive manual work, and are therefore not readily available in many real
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm for ER, called
gradual machine learning, which aims to enable effective machine labeling
without the requirement for manual labeling effort. It begins with some easy
instances in a task, which can be automatically labeled by the machine with
high accuracy, and then gradually labels more challenging instances by
iterative factor graph inference. In gradual machine learning, the hard
instances in a task are gradually labeled in small stages based on the
estimated evidential certainty provided by the labeled easier instances. Our
extensive experiments on real data have shown that the performance of the
proposed approach is considerably better than its unsupervised alternatives,
and highly competitive compared to the state-of-the-art supervised techniques.
Using ER as a test case, we demonstrate that gradual machine learning is a
promising paradigm potentially applicable to other challenging classification
tasks requiring extensive labeling effort.

questions are addressed for algebras obtained by turning the quantum commutator
into a Poisson bracket on moments of a quantum state, truncated to a given
order. In this application, canonical realizations allow one to express the
quantum back-reaction of moments on basic expectation values by means of
effective potentials. In order to match degrees of freedom, faithfulness of the
realization is important, which requires that, at least locally, the space of
moments as a Poisson manifold is realized by a complete set of Casimir-Darboux
coordinates in local charts. A systematic method to derive such variables is
presented and applied to certain sets of moments which are important for

gathered, so that one very important application is periodical data collection.
There is much effort which aimed at the data collection scheduling algorithm
development to minimize the latency. Most of previous works investigating the
minimum latency of data collection issue have an ideal assumption that the
network is a centralized system, in which the entire network is completely
synchronized with full knowledge of components. In addition, most of existing
works often assume that any (or no) data in the network are allowed to be
aggregated into one packet and the network models are often treated as tree
structures. However, in practical, WSNs are more likely to be distributed
systems, since each sensor's knowledge is disjointed to each other, and a fixed
number of data are allowed to to be aggregated into one packet. This is a
formidable motivation for us to investigate the problem of minimum latency for
the data aggregation without data collision in the distributed WSNs when the
sensors are considered to be assigned the channels and the data are compressed
with a flexible aggregation ratio, termed the minimum-latency
collision-avoidance multiple-data-aggregation scheduling with multi-channel

collision-avoidance scheduling (DCAS) algorithm, is proposed to address the
MLCAMDAS-MC. Finally, we provide the theoretical analyses of DCAS and conduct
extensive simulations to demonstrate the performance of DCAS.

feature, target samples are constructed from different parts of various
samples. Furthermore, dissimilarity representation is employed to select
high-quality constructed samples which are used as labeled data to train a

and age of the Internet, and handling communication is of paramount importance
in SOP. Session types are a formalism that is proposed to specify interactions
between communicating processes. In essence, a session type system is a kind of
type system designed to enforce (through type-checking) that the involved
processes communicate according to a chosen protocol specified as a session
type. It is well-known that linear logic plays a pivotal role in the study of
session types. For instance, various inference rules in linear logic can be
interpreted as ways for constructing channels (used by communicating processes
to send/receive messages.) A particularly interesting case is the cut-rule in
linear logic, which can be interpreted as a way for connecting the ends of two
matching channels to form a single new channel. This form of channel
construction is often referred to as linking or (bi-directional) forwarding. We
have generalized classical linear logic into classical linear multirole logic
(LMRL), where the former can be seen as a special case of the latter involving
only two roles. In LMRL, there is a cut-rule involving multiple sequents
(instead of exactly two), which we call multiparty cut (mp-cut). We have also
formulated a novel multiparty session type system directly based on LMRL. When
implementing it, we need to find a way of connecting multiple channels that
corresponds to mp-cut. In this paper, we describe an implementation of linking
for multiparty sessions in the setting of shared memory. We also describe two
novel concepts, two-way linking with residual and three-way linking, which can
only be formulated in the setting of multiparty sessions. Notably, linking for
binary sessions can be thought of as a specially optimized version of what is
implemented for multiparty sessions.

can affect the internal components of hydraulic machinery such as hydraulic

of the interaction of hard particles and cavitation bubbles is developed to
understand their interactive behavior. Experimental tests and numerical
simulations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were performed.
Experimentally, a cavitation bubble was generated with an electric spark near a
solid surface, and its interaction with hard particles of different sizes and
materials was observed using a high-speed camera. A simplified analytical
approach was developed to model the behavior of the particles near the bubble
interface during its collapse. Computationally, we simulated an air bubble that
grew and collapsed near a solid wall while interacting with one particle near
the bubble interface. Several simulations with different conditions were made
and validated with the experimental data. The experimental data obtained from
particles above the bubble were consistent with the numerical results and
analytical study. The particle size, density and position of the particle with
respect to the bubble interface strongly affected the maximum velocity of the

circular polarization. The spin wave in antiferromagnet, however, is endowed
with the full polarization degree of freedom because of the two identical
magnetic sublattices. In the synthetic antiferromagnet, the two magnetic
sublattices are spatially separated into two sublayers. The circular
polarization of spin wave is partially locked to the magnetic sublattice of the
antiferromagnet, thus to the sublayer in synthetic antiferromagnet. Based on
this unique polarization-sublayer locking mechanism, we show that both the
circular spin wave polarizer and retarder (wave-plate) can be straightforwardly
realized using synthetic antiferromagnets by restructuring the sublayers, e.g.
by removing or capping a portion of a sublayer. Manipulating spin wave
polarization by geometrical engineering provides a simple yet powerful paradigm

from gas not bound to the galaxy of interest but in the same line of sight
crucially lead to larger HI mass measurements in the mocks in many cases,
ultimately aligning with observations. This effect is mass-dependent and
naturally greater for satellites than centrals, as satellites are never

closely accompanied by quenching, in tension with observational data that
instead favour that HI is preferentially stripped before star formation is

Hamiltonian of the relativisitc model, once Taylor-expanded, results in a
P-spin series with alternate signs: the attractive contributions enhance the
information-storage capabilities of the network, while the repulsive

overall more robustness to the system as a whole. Here we do not deepen the
information processing skills of this generalized Hopfield network, rather we
focus on its statistical mechanical foundation. In particular, relying on
Guerra's interpolation techniques, we prove the existence of the infinite

techniques either match the current image against keyframes with known poses,
directly regress the pose, or establish correspondences between keypoints in
the image and points in the scene to estimate the pose. In recent years,
regression forests have become a popular alternative to establish such
correspondences. They achieve accurate results, but have traditionally needed
to be trained offline on the target scene, preventing relocalisation in new
environments. Recently, we showed how to circumvent this limitation by adapting
a pre-trained forest to a new scene on the fly. The adapted forests achieved
relocalisation performance that was on par with that of offline forests, and
our approach was able to estimate the camera pose in close to real time. In
this paper, we present an extension of this work that achieves significantly
better relocalisation performance whilst running fully in real time. To achieve
this, we make several changes to the original approach: (i) instead of
accepting the camera pose hypothesis without question, we make it possible to
score the final few hypotheses using a geometric approach and select the most
promising; (ii) we chain several instantiations of our relocaliser together in
a cascade, allowing us to try faster but less accurate relocalisation first,
only falling back to slower, more accurate relocalisation as necessary; and
(iii) we tune the parameters of our cascade to achieve effective overall
performance. These changes allow us to significantly improve upon the
performance our original state-of-the-art method was able to achieve on the
well-known 7-Scenes and Stanford 4 Scenes benchmarks. As additional
contributions, we present a way of visualising the internal behaviour of our
forests and show how to entirely circumvent the need to pre-train a forest on a
generic scene.

neural networks' (CNNs) superior performance in many problems involving graphs.
By replacing regular convolutions with linear shift-invariant graph filters
(LSI-GFs), GNNs take into account the (irregular) structure of the graph and
provide meaningful representations of network data. However, LSI-GFs fail to
encode local nonlinear graph signal behavior, and so do regular activation
functions, which are nonlinear but pointwise. To address this issue, we propose
median activation functions with support on graph neighborhoods instead of
individual nodes. A GNN architecture with a trainable multirresolution version
of this activation function is then tested on synthetic and real-word datasets,
where we show that median activation functions can improve GNN capacity with
marginal increase in complexity.

associations between common genetic variants observations and a given
phenotype. However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment
must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we
consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize
an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic
marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are
available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation
uniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of
genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the
complex relationship between environment and genome in the expression of a
given phenotype. Contributions. We propose a novel approach for efficiently
detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional
setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces
the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in
the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted
group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso
selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of
potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing. Results.
We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample
sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing
results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to
running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic
markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere
bacterial community. Software availability. A R package is available, along

main obstacles. First, distinct emotions might not be clearly visible. Second,
participants cause-effect relation is transient and variant over time. In this

present even when strong distinct facial emotions are not visible. We also
propose to apply a relevant interval selection approach prior to causal

occurs. To identify the direction of influence, we apply the concept of Granger
causality to the time series of facial expressions on the set of relevant

approaches, are performed within truncated model spaces. These require
consistent transformations of the Hamiltonian and operators to account for the
missing physics beyond the active space, so that several recent efforts have
been devoted to find compatible derivations of the effective operators. The
effective charges employed in the shell-model calculations, and fitted to
reproduce experimental data, can be seen as the phenomenological counterpart of
such renormalization for electromagnetic operators. Here, we make a first step
to lay the bases for their microscopic derivation in the context of the
Self-Consistent Green's Function approach. We compute electric quadrupole (E2)
effective charges from microscopic theory by coupling the single-nucleon
propagators to core-polarization phonons, derived consistently from a realistic
nuclear interaction. The polarization effects are included by evaluating the
Feynman diagrams that couple the internal multi-nucleon configurations to the
single-particle transitions induced by the electromagnetic operator. The
effective charges for E2 static moments and transitions are computed for
selected isotopes in the Oxygen ($^{14}\text{O}$, $^{16}$O, $^{22}$O and
$^{24}$O) and Nickel ($^{48}$Ni, $^{56}$Ni, $^{68}$Ni and $^{78}$Ni) chains.
The values found are orbital dependent especially for the neutron effective
charges, which show also a characteristic decreasing trend along each isotopic
chain. In general, the values are compatible with the phenomenological ones
commonly used for shell-model studies in the $0p\, 1s\, 0d$ and
$1p\,0f\,0g_{\frac{9}{2}}$ valence spaces.The phenomenological shell-model
effective charges can be explained through \textit{ab initio} approaches, where

management on road networks. This paper proposes an optimal control approach
for congestion pricing for day-to-day timescale that incorporates demand
uncertainty and elasticity. Travelers make the decision to travel or not based
on the experienced system travel time in the previous day and traffic managers
take tolling decisions in order to minimize the average system travel time over
a long time horizon. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and analyze the problem to see if it satisfies conditions for conducting
a satisfactory solution analysis. Such an analysis of MDPs is often dependent
on the type of state space as well as on the boundedness of travel time
functions. We do not constrain the travel time functions to be bounded and
present an analysis centered around weighted sup-norm contractions that also
holds for unbounded travel time functions. We find that the formulated MDP
satisfies a set of assumptions to ensure Bellman's optimality condition.
Through this result, the existence of the optimal average cost of the MDP is
shown. A method based on approximate dynamic programming is proposed to resolve
the implementation and computational issues of solving the control problem.
Numerical results suggest that the proposed method efficiently solves the
problem and produces accurate solutions.

Biobank (UKBB), manual identification of artefacts such as those caused by
unanticipated motion is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an
urgent need for automatic image quality assessment techniques. In this paper,
we propose a method to automatically detect the presence of motion-related
artefacts in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images. We compare two deep
learning architectures to classify poor quality CMR images: 1) 3D
spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN), 2) Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Network (LRCN). Though in real clinical setup motion artefacts
are common, high-quality imaging of UKBB, which comprises cross-sectional
population data of volunteers who do not necessarily have health problems
creates a highly imbalanced classification problem. Due to the high number of
good quality images compared to the relatively low number of images with motion
artefacts, we propose a novel data augmentation scheme based on synthetic
artefact creation in k-space. We also investigate a learning approach using a
predetermined curriculum based on synthetic artefact severity. We evaluate our
pipeline on a subset of the UK Biobank data set consisting of 3510 CMR images.
The LRCN architecture outperformed the 3D-CNN architecture and was able to
detect 2D+time short axis images with motion artefacts in less than 1ms with
high recall. We compare our approach to a range of state-of-the-art quality
assessment methods. The novel data augmentation and curriculum learning
approaches both improved classification performance achieving overall area
under the ROC curve of 0.89.

toolbox and have led to many breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence. These
networks have mostly been developed for regular Euclidean domains such as those
supporting images, audio, or video. Because of their success, CNN-based methods
are becoming increasingly popular in Cosmology. Cosmological data often comes
as spherical maps, which make the use of the traditional CNNs more complicated.
The commonly used pixelization scheme for spherical maps is the Hierarchical
Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation (HEALPix). We present a spherical CNN for
analysis of full and partial HEALPix maps, which we call DeepSphere. The
spherical CNN is constructed by representing the sphere as a graph. Graphs are
versatile data structures that can act as a discrete representation of a
continuous manifold. Using the graph-based representation, we define many of
the standard CNN operations, such as convolution and pooling. With filters
restricted to being radial, our convolutions are equivariant to rotation on the
sphere, and DeepSphere can be made invariant or equivariant to rotation. This
way, DeepSphere is a special case of a graph CNN, tailored to the HEALPix
sampling of the sphere. This approach is computationally more efficient than
using spherical harmonics to perform convolutions. We demonstrate the method on
a classification problem of weak lensing mass maps from two cosmological models
and compare the performance of the CNN with that of two baseline classifiers.
The results show that the performance of DeepSphere is always superior or equal
to both of these baselines. For high noise levels and for data covering only a
smaller fraction of the sphere, DeepSphere achieves typically 10% better
classification accuracy than those baselines. Finally, we show how learned
filters can be visualized to introspect the neural network.

Applied to the problem of quantum error correction this gives hierarchies of
efficiently computable outer bounds on the optimal fidelity for any message
dimension and error model. The first level of our hierarchies corresponds to
the non-signalling assisted fidelity previously studied by [Leung & Matthews,
IEEE Trans.~Inf.~Theory 2015], and positive partial transpose constraints can
be added and used to give a sufficient criterion for the exact convergence at a
given level of the hierarchy. To quantify the worst case convergence speed of
our hierarchies, we derive novel quantum de Finetti theorems that allow
imposing linear constraints on the approximating state. In particular, we give
finite de Finetti theorems for quantum channels, quantifying closeness to the
convex hull of product channels as well as closeness to local operations and
classical forward communication assisted channels. As a special case this
constitutes a finite version of Fuchs-Schack-Scudo's asymptotic de Finetti
theorem for quantum channels. Finally, our proof methods also allow us to
answer an open question from [Brand\~ao & Harrow, STOC 2013] by improving the

nuclei, we observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 on two occasions in December
2016 triggered by Swift monitoring indicating strong soft X-ray absorption in
November. We obtained ultraviolet spectra using COS on HST and optical spectra
using FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope that were simultaneous with X-ray
spectra from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We find new components of broad,
blue-shifted absorption associated with Ly$\alpha$, \ion{N}{v}, \ion{Si}{iv},
and \ion{C}{iv} in our COS spectra. The absorption extends from velocities near
zero in the rest-frame of the host galaxy to $-6200$ $\rm km~s^{-1}$. These
features appear for the first time in NGC 3783 at the same time as the heavy
soft X-ray absorption seen in the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The X-ray
absorption has a column density of $\sim 10^{23}~\rm cm^{-2}$, and it partially
covers the X-ray continuum source. The X-ray absorption becomes more
transparent in the second observation, as does the UV absorption. Combining the
X-ray column densities with the UV spectral observations yields an ionization
parameter for the obscuring gas of log $\xi =1.84^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ $\rm
erg~cm~s^{-1}$. Despite the high intensity of the UV continuum in NGC 3783,
F(1470 \AA)=$8 \times 10^{-14}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~\AA^{-1}$, the well known
narrow UV absorption lines are deeper than in earlier observations in
unobscured states, and low ionization species such as \ion{C}{iii} appear,
indicating that the narrow-line gas is more distant from the nucleus and is
being shadowed by the gas producing the obscuration. Despite the high continuum
flux levels in our observations of NGC 3783, moderate velocities in the UV
broad line profiles have substantially diminished. We suggest that a collapse
of the broad line region has led to the outburst and triggered the obscuring
event.

operators, which sets the difference, $|\Delta S|=2$, between the vorticities
of the two components. We have found stable solitons of two types:
vortex-antivortex (VAV) and semi-vortex (SV) bound states, featuring
vorticities $\left( -1,+1\right) $ and $\left( 0,2\right) $, respectively. In
previous works, 2D localized states of these types were found only in models
including a trapping potential, while we are dealing with the self-trapping
effect in the latteraly unconfined (free-space) model. The SV states are stable
in a narrow interval of values of the gain coefficients. The stability interval
is broader for VAV states, and it may be expanded by making SOC stronger
(although the system without SOC features a stability interval too). We have
found three branches of stationary solutions of both VAV and SV types, two
unstable and one stable. The latter one is an attractor, as the unstable states
spontaneously transform into the stable one, while retaining vorticities of
their components. Unlike previously known 2D localized states, maintained by
the combination of the trapping potential and SOC, in the present system the
VAV and SV complexes are stable in the absence of diffusion. In contrast with
the bright solitons in conservative models, chemical potentials of the
dissipative solitons reported here are positive.

formalism to calculate the size distribution of randomly distributed
self-ionized regions. These ionization bubbles are surrounded by partially
heated and Lyman-$\alpha$ coupled regions, which create spin temperature $T_S$
fluctuations. We use the ratio of number of Lyman-$\alpha$ to ionizing photon
($f_L$) and number of X-ray photons emitted per stellar baryons ($N_{\rm
heat}$) as modeling parameters. Using our formalism, we compute the global
\ion{H}{1} signal, its auto-correlation and power spectrum in the redshift
range $10 \le z \le 30$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. We check the validity of
this formalism for various limits and simplified cases. Our results agree
reasonably well with existing results from N-body simulations, in spite of
following a different approach and requiring orders of magnitude less
computation power and time. We further apply our formalism to study the
fluctuating component corresponding to the recent EDGES observation that shows
an unexpectedly deep absorption trough in global \ion{H}{1} signal in the
redshift range $15 <z< 19$. We show that, generically, the EDGES observation
predicts larger signal in this redshift range but smaller signal at higher
redshifts. We also explore the possibility of negative real-space
auto-correlation of spin temperature and show it can be achieved for partial
Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling in many cases corresponding to simplified models and
complete model without density perturbations.

implicit feedbacks ignoring users' explicit feedbacks. Explicit feedbacks can
be used to validate the reliability of the particular users and can be used to
learn about the users' characteristic. Users' characteristic mean what type of

recommendation with more accuracy focusing on users' explicit feedbacks and
implicit feedbacks. First one is RHC-PMF that predicts users' rating more
accurately based on user's three explicit feedbacks (rating, helpfulness score
and centrality) and second one is RV-PMF, where user's implicit feedback (view

the similarity of their reliability and characteristic and implicit feedback's

two most spectacular eruptions in the Sun: solar flares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), and their magnetism. For the studies of CMEs, the payload
Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) has been proposed. It includes a traditional
white-light coronagraph and a Lyman-alpha coronagraph which opens a new window
to CME observations. Polarization measurements taken by white-light
coronagraphs are crucial to derive fundamental physical parameters of CMEs. To
make such measurements, there are two options of Stokes polarimeter which have
been used by existing white-light coronagraphs for space missions. One uses a
single or triple linear polarizers, the other involves both a half-wave plate
and a linear polarizer. We find that the former option subjects to less
uncertainty in the derived Stokes vector propagated from detector noise. The
latter option involves two plates which are prone to internal reflections and
may have a reduced transmission factor. Therefore, the former option is adopted
as our Stokes polarimeter scheme for LST. Based on the parameters of the
intended linear polarizer(s) colorPol provided by CODIXX and the half-wave
plate 2-APW-L2-012C by Altechna, it is further shown that the imperfect maximum
transmittance of the polarizer significantly increases the variance
amplification of Stokes vector by at least about 50% when compared with the
ideal case. The relative errors of Stokes vector caused by the imperfection of
colorPol polarizer and the uncertainty due to the polarizer assembling in the
telescope are estimated to be about 5%. Among the considered parameters, we
find that the dominant error comes from the uncertainty in the maximum
transmittance of the polarizer.

that whenever the four dimensional space-time continuum containing a single,

of field potential to become one composite radius vector. The latter is
considered as the radius vector in an octonion composite space, which belongs
to the function spaces. In the octonion composite space, when there is the
relative motion between two coordinate systems, it is capable of deducing the
Galilean-like transformation and Lorentz-like transformation. From the two
transformations, one can achieve the influence of relative speed on the speed
of light (or Sagnac effect), but also the impact of partial electromagnetic
potential on the speed of light. The study states that the partial
electromagnetic potential has a direct influence on the speed of light in the
optical waveguides, revealing several influencing factors of refractive indices
in the optical waveguides.

Because the movement of sensors consumes much more power than that in sensing

targets and maintain network connectivity such that the total movement distance
of mobile sensors is minimized has received a great deal of attention. However,
in reality, due to a limited budget or numerous targets, mobile sensors may be
not enough to cover all targets or form a connected network. Therefore, targets
must be weighted by their importance. The more important a target, the higher
the weight of the target. A more general problem for target coverage and
network connectivity, termed the Maximum Weighted Target Coverage and Sensor
Connectivity with Limited Mobile Sensors (MWTCSCLMS) problem, is studied. In
this paper, an approximation algorithm, termed the
weighted-maximum-coverage-based algorithm (WMCBA), is proposed for the
subproblem of the MWTCSCLMS problem. Based on the WMCBA, the Steiner-tree-based

development of sensor networks in connected vehicles, multimodal data are

modalities, images and velocity, in our vehicle-tracking task. Images, being
processed in the module of vehicle detection, provide direct information about
the features of vehicles, whereas velocity estimation can further evaluate the
possible location of the target vehicles, which reduces the number of features
being compared, and decreases the time consumption and computational cost.
Vehicle detection is designed with a color-faster R-CNN, which takes both the
shape and color of the vehicles into consideration. Meanwhile, velocity
estimation is through the Kalman filter, which is a classical method for
tracking. Finally, a multimodal data fusion method is applied to integrate
these outcomes so that vehicle-tracking tasks can be achieved. Experimental
results suggest the efficiency of our methods, which can track vehicles using a
series of surveillance cameras in urban areas.

non-trivial, as it depends on the choice of strain-energy density and the
arrangements of the fibres. For anisotropic hyperelastic tubes where the
material parameters are single-valued constants, the problem has been
satisfactorily addressed. However, in many systems, the material parameters are
not precisely known, and it is therefore more appropriate to treat them as
random variables. The problem is then to understand chirality in a
probabilistic framework. Here, we develop a procedure for examining the elastic
responses of a hyperelastic cylindrical tube of stochastic anisotropic
material, where the material parameters are spatially-independent random
variables defined by probability density functions. The tube is subjected to
uniform dead loading consisting of internal pressure, axial tension and torque.
Assuming that the tube wall is thin and that the resulting deformation is the
combined inflation, extension and torsion from the reference circular
cylindrical configuration to a deformed circular cylindrical state, we derive
the probabilities of radial expansion or contraction, and of right-handed or
left-handed torsion. We refer to these stochastic behaviours as `likely
inflation' and `likely chirality', respectively.
