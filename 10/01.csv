  $\leq 4$",,,,,"math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In [2], the authors prove Stillman's conjecture in all characteristics and
all degrees by showing that, independent of the algebraically closed field $K$
or the number of variables, $n$ forms of degree at most $d$ in a polynomial
ring $R$ over $K$ are contained in a polynomial subalgebra of $R$ generated by
a regular sequence consisting of at most ${}^\eta\!B(n,d)$ forms of degree at
most $d$: we refer to these informally as ""small"" subalgebras. Moreover, these
forms can be chosen so that the ideal generated by any subset defines a ring
satisfying the Serre condition R$_\eta$. A critical element in the proof is to
show that there are functions ${}^\eta\!A(n,d)$ with the following property: in
a graded $n$-dimensional $K$-vector subspace $V$ of $R$ spanned by forms of
degree at most $d$, if no nonzero form in $V$ is in an ideal generated by
${}^\eta\!A(n,d)$ forms of strictly lower degree (we call this a {\it strength}
condition), then any homogeneous basis for $V$ is an R$_\eta$ sequence. The
methods of \cite{AH2} are not constructive. In this paper, we use related but
different ideas that emphasize the notion of a {\it key function} to obtain the
functions ${}^\eta\!A(n,d)$ in degrees 2, 3, and 4 (in degree 4 we must
restrict to characteristic not 2, 3). We give bounds in closed form for the key
functions and the ${}^\eta\!A$ functions, and explicit recursions that
determine the functions ${}^\eta\!B$ from the ${}^\eta\!A$ functions. In degree
2, we obtain an explicit value for ${}^\eta\!B(n,2)$ that gives the best known
bound in Stillman's conjecture for quadrics when there is no restriction on
$n$. In particular, for an ideal $I$ generated by $n$ quadrics, the projective
dimension $R/I$ is at most $2^{n+1}(n - 2) + 4$.

quality factors ($Q$) due to the dilution of intrinsic dissipation by stress.
Typically, the amount of dissipation dilution and thus the resonator $Q$ is
limited by the high mode curvature region near the clamps. Here we study the
effect of clamp geometry on the $Q$ of nanobeams made of high-stress
$\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$. We find that tapering the beam near the clamp - and locally
increasing the stress - leads to increased $Q$ of MHz-frequency low order modes
due to enhanced dissipation dilution. Contrary to recent studies of
tethered-membrane resonators, we find that widening the clamps leads to
decreased $Q$ despite increased stress in the beam bulk. The tapered-clamping
approach has practical advantages compared to the recently developed
""soft-clamping"" technique. Tapered-clamping enhances the $Q$ of the fundamental
mode and can be implemented without increasing the device size.

delivery losses. Motivated by the real-world needs to automate and optimize the

of demand-side uncertainties. We show that look-ahead moving window

density of states $\nu_F$ and the resistivity $\rho$, occurring when the Fermi
level $E$ crosses a bottom $E_N$ of some subband of transverse quantization. We
demonstrate that the character of smearing of the singularities crucially
depends on the concentration of impurities. There is a crossover concentration
$n_c\propto |\lambda|$, $\lambda\ll 1$ being the dimensionless amplitude of
scattering. For $n\gg n_c$ the singularities are simply rounded at
$\varepsilon\equiv E-E_N\sim \tau^{-1}$ -- the Born scattering rate. For $n\ll
n_c$ the non-Born effects in scattering become essential despite $\lambda\ll
1$. The peak of the resistivity is asymmetrically split in a Fano-resonance
manner (however with a more complex structure). Namely, for $\varepsilon>0$
there is a broad maximum at $\varepsilon\propto \lambda^2$ while for
$\varepsilon<0$ there is a deep minimum at $|\varepsilon|\propto n^2\ll
\lambda^2$. The behaviour of $\rho$ below the minimum depends on the sign of
$\lambda$. In case of repulsion $\rho$ monotonically grows with $|\varepsilon|$
and saturates for $|\varepsilon|\gg \lambda^2$. In case of attraction $\rho$
has sharp maximum at $|\varepsilon|\propto \lambda^2$. The latter feature is
due to resonant scattering by quasistationary bound states that inevitably
arise just below the bottom of each subband for any attracting impurity.

correlation in video. CaTDet consists of two DNN models that form a cascaded
detector, and an additional tracker to predict regions of interests based on
historic detections. We also propose a new metric, mean Delay(mD), which is
designed for latency-critical video applications. Experiments on the KITTI
dataset show that CaTDet reduces operation count by 5.1-8.7x with the same mean
Average Precision(mAP) as the single-model Faster R-CNN detector and incurs
additional delay of 0.3 frame. On CityPersons dataset, CaTDet achieves 13.0x
reduction in operations with 0.8% mAP loss.

  Parameters","Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While deep neural networks are a highly successful model class, their large
memory footprint puts considerable strain on energy consumption, communication
bandwidth, and storage requirements. Consequently, model size reduction has
become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of
deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and
quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable
to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing
weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights
allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression
rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the
network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits
corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled
variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a
constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly
control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the
training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the
optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed
variational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network
compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On
the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best
test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the
highest compression rates for a fixed test performance.

correlations incompatible with local hidden variable models. The degree of
quantum nonlocality is not maximal though, as there are even more nonlocal
theories beyond quantum theory still compatible with the nonsignalling
principle. In spite of decades of research, we still have a very fragmented
picture of the whole geometry of these different sets of correlations. Here we
employ both analytical and numerical tools to ameliorate that. First, we
identify two different classes of Bell scenarios where the nonsignalling
correlations can behave very differently: in one case, the correlations are
generically quantum and nonlocal while on the other quite the opposite happens
as the correlations are generically classical and local. Second, by randomly
sampling over nonsignalling correlations, we compute the distribution of a
nonlocality quantifier based on the trace distance to the local set. With that,
we conclude that the nonlocal correlations can show concentration phenomena:
their distribution is peaked at a distance from the local set that increases
both with the number of parts or measurements being performed.

materials for quantum spin-ice and spin-liquid physics. While the majority of
such work has centered on members of the pyrochlore family due to their
inherently frustrated linked tetrahedral structure, the rare-earth
pyrogermanates also show promise for possible frustrated magnetic behavior.
With the familiar stoichiometry $RE_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$, these compounds generally
have tetragonal symmetry with a rare-earth sublattice built of a spiral of
alternating edge and corner sharing rare-earth site triangles. Studies on
Dy$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ have shown tunable low temperature
antiferromagnetic order, a high frustration index and spin-ice like dynamics.
Here we use neutron diffraction to study magnetic order in Er$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$
(space group $P4_{1}2_{1}2$ ) and find the lowest yet Ne\'el temperature in the
pyrogermanates of 1.15 K. Using neutron powder diffraction we find the magnetic
structure to order with $k = (0,0,0)$ ordering vector, magnetic space group
symmetry $P4_{1}^{'}2_{1}2^{'}$ and a refined Er moment of $m = 8.1 \mu_B$ -
near the expected value for the Er$^{3+}$ free ion. Provocatively, the magnetic
structure exhibits similar 'local-Ising' behavior to that seen in the
pyrocholres where the Er moment points up or down along the short Er-Er bond.
Upon applying a magnetic field we find a first order metamagnetic transition at
$\sim$ 0.35 T to a lower symmetry $P2_{1}^{'}2_{1}^{'}2$ structure. This
magnetic transition involves an inversion of Er moments aligned antiparallel to
the applied field describing a class I spin-flip type transition, indicating a
strong local anisotropy at the Er site - reminiscent of that seen in the
spin-ice pyrochlores.

model where the sequence of arrivals contains both an adversarial component and
a stochastic one. Our model requires no demand forecasting; however, due to the
presence of the stochastic component, we can partially predict future demand as
the sequence of arrivals unfolds. Under the proposed model, we study the
problem of the online allocation of a single resource to two types of
customers, and design online algorithms that outperform existing ones. Our
algorithms are adjustable to the relative size of the stochastic component, and
our analysis reveals that as the portion of the stochastic component grows, the
loss due to making online decisions decreases. This highlights the value of
(even partial) predictability in online resource allocation. We impose no
conditions on how the resource capacity scales with the maximum number of
customers. However, we show that using an adaptive algorithm---which makes
online decisions based on observed data---is particularly beneficial when
capacity scales linearly with the number of customers. Our work serves as a
first step in bridging the long-standing gap between the two well-studied
approaches to the design and analysis of online algorithms based on (1)
adversarial models and (2) stochastic ones. Using novel algorithm design, we
demonstrate that even if the arrival sequence contains an adversarial
component, we can take advantage of the limited information that the data
reveals to improve allocation decisions. We also study the classical secretary
problem under our proposed arrival model, and we show that randomizing over
multiple stopping rules may increase the probability of success.

computationally expensive, because it needs to solve a set of linear programs.
In this paper, we propose simpler and faster streaming and W-stream algorithms

complexity, which is roughly a square root of the current best bound, and it is
simpler in the sense that our algorithm mainly relies on computing the convex

calculate the polarizability with equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory

large class of diagrammatically-defined vertex corrections beyond the random

accurate than that predicted by the RPA. We evaluate the effect of these vertex
corrections on a test set of 20 atoms and molecules. When using a Hartree-Fock
reference, ionization potentials predicted by the $GW$ approximation with the
RPA polarizability are typically overestimated with a mean absolute error of
0.3 eV. However, those predicted with a vertex-corrected polarizability are
typically underestimated with an increased mean absolute error of 0.5 eV. This
result suggests that vertex corrections in the self-energy cannot be neglected,
at least for molecules. We also assess the behavior of eigenvalue
self-consistency in vertex-corrected $GW$ calculations, finding a further
worsening of the predicted ionization potentials.

The key of obtaining a quantitative model of regret theory is to measure the
preference in humans' mind when they choose among a set of options. Unlike
physical quantities, measuring psychological preference is not procedure
invariant, i.e. the readings alter when the methods change. In this work, we
alleviate this influence by choosing the procedure compatible with the way that
an individual makes a choice. We believe the resulting model is closer to the
nature of human decision-making. The preference elicitation process is
decomposed into a series of short surveys to reduce cognitive workload and
increase response accuracy. To make the questions natural and familiar to the
subjects, we follow the insight that humans generate, quantify and communicate
preference in natural language. The fuzzy-set theory is hence utilized to model
responses from subjects. Based on these ideas, a graphical human-computer
interface (HCI) is designed to articulate the information as well as to
efficiently collect human responses. The design also accounts for human
heuristics and biases, e.g. range effect and anchoring effect, to enhance its
reliability. The overall performance of the survey is satisfactory because the
measured model shows prediction accuracy equivalent to the revisit-performance
of the subjects.

In this paper, we demonstrate the powerful capabilities that modern browser

for unwanted computation or harmful operations, such as cryptocurrency mining,
password-cracking, and DDoS. MarioNet relies solely on already available HTML5

such persistent in-browser attacks. Our main goal is to raise awareness

cellular organelle, cilia. While many of the molecular components that make up
cilia have been identified and studied, comparatively little is understood
about the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding these components. The
conserved transcription factor Regulatory Factor X (RFX)/DAF-19, which acts
through binding to the cis-regulatory motif known as X-box, has been shown to
regulate ciliary genes in many animals from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans.
However, accumulating evidence suggests that RFX is unable to initiate
transcription on its own. Therefore, other factors and cis-regulatory elements
are likely required. One such element, a DNA motif called the C-box, has
recently been identified in C. elegans. It is still unclear if the X-box and
C-boxes are the only regulatory elements involved and how they interact. To
this end, I analyzed the transcriptional regulation of dyf-5, the C. elegans
ortholog of the human ciliopathy gene Male-Associated Kinase (MAK). Using
computational methods, I was able to confirm the presence of the previously
reported X-box and C-boxes as well as identifying an additional C-box. By
sequentially mutating each of the identified motifs, I identified the role each
potential motif plays in transcriptional regulation of dyf-5. My results showed
that only the X-box and the three C-boxes are necessary and are sufficient to
drive transcription, with the X-box and the centre C-box being the major
contributors and the other two C-boxes enhancing expression. This study
advances the knowledge of gene regulation in general and will further our
understanding of ciliopathies and the mutations that cause them.

to dimensional reduction of the electronic Hamiltonian, and an increase in
electronic bandwidth due to counterlayer induced bond angle changes. We find
that the confinement effect is much more important. The lattice effect is an

degrades the data quality, reduces the interpretation accuracy of HSIs, and
restricts the subsequent HSIs applications. In this paper, the spatial-spectral
gradient network (SSGN) is presented for mixed noise removal in HSIs. The
proposed method employs a spatial-spectral gradient learning strategy, in
consideration of the unique spatial structure directionality of sparse noise
and spectral differences with additional complementary information for better
extracting intrinsic and deep features of HSIs. Based on a fully cascaded
multi-scale convolutional network, SSGN can simultaneously deal with the
different types of noise in different HSIs or spectra by the use of the same
model. The simulated and real-data experiments undertaken in this study
confirmed that the proposed SSGN performs better at mixed noise removal than

global analysis of pion-pair production in deep-inelastic scattering and in
proton-proton collisions with one transversely polarized proton. The extraction
relies on the knowledge of di-hadron fragmentation functions, which are taken
from the analysis of electron-positron annihilation data. For the first time,
the chiral-odd transversity is extracted from a global analysis similar to what

  We further show that the same result is true if one considers only
homeomorphisms rather than con\-ti\-nuous maps. The problem for group actions
is also addressed. For some class of group actions (by homeomorphisms) we
provide an analogous result, but in full generality this problem remains open.
The result works also for an analogous class of semigroup actions (by
continuous maps).

advantages of reducing X-ray radiation dose and using a small detector.
However, standard analytic reconstruction methods suffer from severe cupping
artifacts, and existing model-based iterative reconstruction methods require
extensive computations. Recently, we proposed a deep neural network to learn
the cupping artifact, but the network is not well generalized for different
ROIs due to the singularities in the corrupted images. Therefore, there is an
increasing demand for a neural network that works well for any ROI sizes. In
this paper, two types of neural networks are designed. The first type learns
ROI size-specific cupping artifacts from the analytic reconstruction images,
whereas the second type network is to learn to invert the finite Hilbert
transform from the truncated differentiated backprojection (DBP) data. Their
generalizability for any ROI sizes is then examined. Experimental results show
that the new type of neural network significantly outperforms the existing
iterative methods for any ROI size in spite of significantly reduced run-time
complexity. Since the proposed method consistently surpasses existing methods
for any ROIs, it can be used as a general CT reconstruction engine for many
practical applications without compromising possible detector truncation.

a great number of photon energies of only a few tens of eV. Moreover, the

for online ranking, classification, clustering, etc., where machine learning

  We provide two simple LRC algorithms, deterministic and randomized, for

that both of these algorithms have an $\mathcal{O}(\log{}|H|)$ asymptotically
optimal average learning time. This solves an open problem on the existence of
an efficient LRC randomized algorithm while simplifying and generalizing

LRC algorithm can be upper bounded by
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log{\frac{|H|}{\delta}})$, where $\epsilon$ and
$\delta$ are the allowed learning error and failure probability respectively.

$k\lesssim k_\times$ and $E_{xz} (k_y)\propto k_y^{-m_F}$ for $k\gtrsim

relatively strong (for $k\lesssim k_\times$) and relatively weak (for $k\gtrsim

imitation learning for an approximated agent model and ii) pure

the assessment of continuous raster data. The use of conventional diagnostics
of error often overlooks the possible spatial variation in error because such
diagnostics report only average error or deviation between predicted and
reference values. In this respect, this work uses a moving window (kernel)
approach to generate geographically weighted (GW) versions of the mean signed
deviation, the mean absolute error and the root mean squared error and to
quantify their spatial variations. Such approach computes local error
diagnostics from data weighted by its distance to the centre of a moving kernel
and allows to map spatial surfaces of each type of error. In addition, a GW
correlation analysis between predicted and reference values provides an
alternative view of local error. Full abstract can be found in the pdf.

the relativistic flows of plasma along two oppositely directed jets. We use the
Athena hydrodynamics code to simulate an extensive suite of 54 propagating
three-dimensional relativistic jets with wide ranges of input jet velocities
and jet-to-ambient matter density ratios. We determine which parameter sets
yield unstable jets that produce jet dominated FR I type radio galaxy
morphologies and which tend to produce stable jets with hot-spots and FR II
morphologies. Nearly all our simulations involve jets with internal pressures
matched to those of the ambient medium but we also consider over-pressured jets
and discuss differences from the standard ones. We also show that the results
are not strongly dependent on the adiabatic index of the fluid. We focus on
simulations that remain stable for extended distances (60-240) times the
initial jet radius. Scaled to the much smaller sizes probed by VLBI
observations, the fluctuations in such simulated flows yield variability in
observed emissivity on timescales from months. Adopting results for the
densities, pressures and velocities from these simulations we estimate
normalized rest frame synchrotron emissivities from individual cells in the
jets. The observed emission from each cell is strongly dependent upon its
variable Doppler boosting factor. We sum the fluxes from thousands of zones
around the primary reconfinement shock. The light curves an power-spectra, with
red-noise slopes between -2.1 and -2.5, so produced are similar to those
observed from blazars.

Ensemble Selection (DES) techniques can select classifiers that classify all
samples in the region of competence as being from the same class. The Frienemy
Indecision REgion DES (FIRE-DES) tackles this problem by pre-selecting
classifiers that correctly classify at least one pair of samples from different
classes in the region of competence of the test sample. However, FIRE-DES
applies the pre-selection for the classification of a test sample if and only
if its region of competence is composed of samples from different classes
(indecision region), even though this criterion is not reliable for determining
if a test sample is located close to the borders of classes (true indecision
region) when the region of competence is obtained using classical nearest
neighbors approach. Because of that, FIRE-DES mistakes noisy regions for true
indecision regions, leading to the pre-selection of incompetent classifiers,
and mistakes true indecision regions for safe regions, leaving samples in such
regions without any pre-selection. To tackle these issues, we propose the
FIRE-DES++, an enhanced FIRE-DES that removes noise and reduces the overlap of
classes in the validation set; and defines the region of competence using an
equal number of samples of each class, avoiding selecting a region of
competence with samples of a single class. Experiments are conducted using
FIRE-DES++ with 8 different dynamic selection techniques on 64 classification
datasets. Experimental results show that FIRE-DES++ increases the
classification performance of all DES techniques considered in this work,
outperforming FIRE-DES with 7 out of the 8 DES techniques, and outperforming
state-of-the-art DES frameworks.

structure in X-rays, and the X-ray-emission peaks are significantly offset from
the peaks in gas temperature. By de-projecting the annular spectra, the
temperature and electron density in the central $r<0.1r_{200}$ region are
measured to be 3.6~keV and $1.4\times10^{-3}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, respectively. This
yields a very high gas entropy, $\sim 300~{\rm keV\,cm^{2}}$, in the central

entropy of Abell 2399 is the highest among the REXCESS cluster sample. The
spatial distribution of the member galaxies exhibits multiple substructures,
the locations of which are significantly different from those in the X-ray

multiplexing (NC-OFDM) transmissions is investigated and contrasted to OFDM
transmissions for fending off signal exploitation attacks. In contrast to ODFM
transmissions, NC-OFDM transmissions take place over a subset of active
subcarriers to either avoid incumbent transmissions or for strategic
considerations. A point-to-point communication system is considered in this
paper in the presence of an adversary (exploiter) that aims to infer
transmission parameters (e.g., the subset of active subcarriers and duration of
the signal) using a deep neural network (DNN). This method has been proposed
since the existing methods for exploitation, which are based on cyclostationary
analysis, have been shown to have limited success in NC-OFDM systems. A good
estimation of the transmission parameters allows the adversary to transmit
spurious data and attack the legitimate receiver. Simulation results show that
the DNN can infer the transmit parameters of OFDM signals with very good
accuracy. However, NC-OFDM with fully random selection of active subcarriers
makes it difficult for the adversary to exploit the waveform and thus for the
receiver to be affected by the spurious data. Moreover, the more structured the
set of active subcarriers selected by the transmitter is, the easier it is for
the adversary to infer the transmission parameters and attack the receiver
using a DNN.

cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations of a single galaxy cluster, drawn
from the nIFTy comparison project, to study how the dynamics of substructure
accreted from the cosmic web influences the thermodynamical properties of the
ICM in the cluster's outskirts. We demonstrate how features evident in radial
profiles of the ICM (e.g. gas density and temperature) can be linked to strong
shocks, transient and short-lived in nature, driven by the passage of
substructure. The range of astrophysical codes and galaxy formation models in
our comparison are broadly consistent in their predictions (e.g. agreeing when
and where shocks occur, but differing in how strong shocks will be); this is as
we would expect of a process driven by large-scale gravitational dynamics and
strong, inefficiently radiating, shocks. This suggests that mapping such shock
structures in the ICM in a cluster's outskirts (via e.g. radio synchrotron
emission) could provide a complementary measure of its recent merger and
accretion history.

evaluate photometric redshift to identify massive ($M_{\star}\sim10^{11}\

prominent 4000$\rm \AA$ break feature at $z\sim4$, suggestive of an evolved
stellar population. We then conduct follow-up $K'$-band imaging with adaptive
optics for the five brightest galaxies ($K_{AB,total}=22.5\sim23.4$). Compared
to lower redshift ones, QGs at $z\sim4$ have smaller physical sizes of
effective radii $r_{eff}=0.2$ to $1.8$ kpc. The mean size measured by stacking
the four brightest objects is $r_{eff}=0.7\rm\ kpc$. This is the first
measurement of the rest-frame optical sizes of QGs at $z\sim4$. We evaluate the
robustness of our size measurements using simulations and find that our size
estimates are reasonably accurate with an expected systematic bias of $\sim0.2$
kpc. If we account for the stellar mass evolution, massive QGs at $z\sim4$ are
likely to evolve into the most massive galaxies today. We find their size
evolution with cosmic time in a form of $\log(r_e/{\rm kpc})= -0.44+1.77
\log(t/\rm Gyr)$. Their size growth is proportional to the square of stellar
mass, indicating the size-stellar mass growth driven by minor dry mergers.

Moreover, acceleration (a.k.a. momentum) methods and diagonal scaling (a.k.a.
adaptive gradient) methods are the two main techniques to improve the slow
convergence of \textsc{Sgd}. While empirical studies have demonstrated
potential advantages of combining these two techniques, it remains unknown
whether these methods can achieve the optimal rate of convergence for
stochastic optimization. In this paper, we present a new class of adaptive and
accelerated stochastic gradient descent methods and show that they exhibit the
optimal sampling and iteration complexity for stochastic optimization. More
specifically, we show that diagonal scaling, initially designed to improve
vanilla stochastic gradient, can be incorporated into accelerated stochastic
gradient descent to achieve the optimal rate of convergence for smooth
stochastic optimization. We also show that momentum, apart from being known to
speed up the convergence rate of deterministic optimization, also provides us
new ways of designing non-uniform and aggressive moving average schemes in
stochastic optimization. Finally, we present some heuristics that help to
implement adaptive accelerated stochastic gradient descent methods and to
further improve their practical performance for machine learning and deep

robotics middleware. We propose an efficient IPC technique called TZC (Towards
Zero-Copy). As a core component of TZC, we design a novel algorithm called
partial serialization. Our formulation can generate messages that can be
divided into two parts. During message transmission, one part is transmitted
through a socket and the other part uses shared memory. The part within shared
memory is never copied or serialized during its lifetime. We have integrated
TZC with ROS and ROS2 and find that TZC can be easily combined with current
open-source platforms. By using TZC, the overhead of IPC remains constant when
the message size grows. In particular, when the message size is 4MB (less than
the size of a full HD image), TZC can reduce the overhead of ROS IPC from tens
of milliseconds to hundreds of microseconds and can reduce the overhead of ROS2
IPC from hundreds of milliseconds to less than 1 millisecond. We also
demonstrate the benefits of TZC by integrating with TurtleBot2 that are used in
autonomous driving scenarios. We show that by using TZC, the braking distance
can be shortened by 16% than ROS.

to fundamental new insights in condensed matter physics. In this work, we
perform a spatially resolved study of electronic dephasing in three dimensional
topological insulators by exploiting an edge versus surface contacted
measurement scheme. Unlike conventional two dimensional systems that are
characterized by a single dephasing mechanism, we find that dephasing in our
samples evolves from a variable-range-hopping type mechanism on the sample
surface to a Nyquist type electron-electron interaction mechanism in the
sub-surface layers. This is confirmed independently by the temperature and
chemical potential dependence of the dephasing length, and gate dependent
suppression/enhancement of the weak anti-localization effect. Our devices are
fabricated using bulk insulating topological insulator
BiSbTe$_{1.25}$Se$_{1.75}$ capped with hexagonal-Boron Nitride in an inert
environment, ruling out any extrinsic effects and confirming the topological
surface state origin of our results. Our work introduces the idea of spatially

this paper. This electrode geometry forms a unique electric field distribution
based on its anode configuration which is different from the conventional
electrode geometry. There exists a region A between the insulated-anode and the
remote-anode where the electric field vector has opposite directions. The
existence of region A directly affects the movement of electrons in the initial
stage of the discharge, thereby changing the process of vacuum breakdown. The
variation of discharge process affects the generation and propagation mechanism
of plasma, forming a plasma plume in favor of the propulsion performance of
thrusters. The photograph of plasma plume and the electron density spatial
distribution of plasma plume preliminarily prove the pinch effect of
multi-anode electrode geometry on the radial diffusion of plasma. In the
optimization of remote-anode of multi-anode electrode geometry, the variation
of the distance of cathode and remote-anode (short for D) is found to affect
the pinch effect. Through the reduction of D, the directional jet effect of the
multi-anode electrode geometry is enhanced under the same discharge parameters.
Applying it to the VAT (multi-anode VAT) and comparing it with the VAT based on
conventional electrode geometry (conventional VAT), it is found that the
propulsion performance of multi-anode VAT is superior to conventional VAT, and
it is further promoted with the decrease of D. Under the same discharge
parameters, the impulse bit and the thrust-to-power ratio of the multi-anode

side of MoS$_2$ (or vice versa for MoSe$_2$). Due to the different
electronegativity of S and Se these structures carry a finite out-of-plane
dipole moment. As we show here by means of density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, this intrinsic dipole leads to the formation of built-in electric
fields when the monolayers are stacked to form $N$-layer structures. For
sufficiently thin structures ($N<4$) the dipoles add up and shift the vacuum
level on the two sides of the film by $\sim N \cdot 0.7$ eV. However, for
thicker films charge transfer occurs between the outermost layers forming
atomically thin n- and p-doped electron gasses at the two surfaces. The doping
concentration can be tuned between about $5\cdot 10^{12}$ e/cm$^{2}$ and
$2\cdot 10^{13}$ e/cm$^{2}$ by varying the film thickness. The surface charges
counteract the static dipoles leading to saturation of the vacuum level shift
at around 2.2 eV for $N>4$. Based on band structure calculations and the
Mott-Wannier exciton model, we compute the energies of intra- and interlayer
excitons as a function of film thickness suggesting that the Janus multilayer
films are ideally suited for achieving ultrafast charge separation over atomic
length scales without chemical doping or applied electric fields. Finally, we
explore a number of other potentially synthesisable 2D Janus structures with

applications such as plasmonic photo-catalysis for green fuels, nano-scale

requires taking into account all channels of energy flow in the electronic
system. Here, we develop such a theory, which is based on a coupled
Boltzmann-heat equations and requires only energy conservation and basic
thermodynamics, where the electron distribution, and the electron and phonon
(lattice) temperatures are determined {\em uniquely}. Applying this theory to
realistic illuminated nanoparticle systems, we find that the electron and
phonon temperatures are similar, thus justifying the (classical) single
temperature models. We show that while the fraction of high-energy ``hot''
carriers compared to thermalized carriers grows substantially with illumination
intensity, it remains extremely small (on the order of $10^{-8}$). Importantly,
most of the absorbed illumination power goes into heating rather than
generating hot carriers, thus rendering plasmonic hot carrier generation
extremely inefficient. Our formulation allows for the first time a unique
quantitative comparison of theory and measurements of steady-state electron
distributions in metallic nanostructures.

The adaptive polling problem in a hierarchical social network is formulated as

Blackwell dominance to construct myopic policies that provably upper bound the

determine approximate Blackwell dominance for general polling problems. These

objects are proto-BDs or will be in the very early phase of protostars which
will evolve more massive protostars if they gain enough mass from the
surroundings. The ages of these two objects are likely to be within $\sim 10^3$
years after the protostellar core (or second core) formation, taking into
account the outflow dynamical times ($\lesssim$ 500 yrs).

phase transitions as well as their implications on electroweak baryogenesis and
gravitational waves. It is shown that the expectation value of the Higgs field
at the critical temperature of the electroweak phase transition is much smaller
than the critical temperature, which indicates two important facts: (i) the
electroweak phase transition cannot be analyzed perturbatively (ii) the
electroweak baryogenesis is hardly realized in the typical realizations of twin
Higgs models. We also analyze the phase transition associated with the global
symmetry breaking, through which the Standard Model Higgs is identified with
one of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons in terms of its linear realization,
with and without supersymmetry. For this phase transition, we show that, only
in the supersymmetric case, there are still some parameter spaces, in which the
perturbative approach is validated and the phase transition is the first order.
We find that the stochastic gravitational wave background is generated through
this first order phase transition, but it is impossible to be detected by
DECIGO or BBO in the linear realization and the decoupling limit. The detection
of stochastic gravitational wave background with the feature of first order
phase transition, therefore, will give strong constraints on twin Higgs models.

the convergence rate both for the primal iterates and the dual iterates. We
obtain faster convergence rates than the ones known in the literature. We also

distributed simulation middleware. FT-GAIA has being designed to reliably
handle Parallel And Distributed Simulation (PADS) models, which are needed to
properly simulate and analyze complex systems arising in any kind of scientific
or engineering field. PADS takes advantage of multiple execution units run in
multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. However, large
computing systems, such as HPC systems that include hundreds of thousands of
computing nodes, have to handle frequent failures of some components. To cope
with this issue, FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and
distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to
tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes. Moreover, FT-GAIA offers some
protection against Byzantine failures, since interaction messages among the
simulated entities are replicated as well, so that the receiving entity can
identify and discard corrupted messages. Results from an analytical model and
from an experimental evaluation show that FT-GAIA provides a high degree of
fault tolerance, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load
of the execution units.

training still remains a challenge due to a combination of optimization and
generalization issues. In practice, a combination of heuristic algorithms (such
as hand-crafted annealing of KL-terms) is often used in order to achieve the
desired results, but such solutions are not robust to changes in model
architecture or dataset. The best settings can often vary dramatically from one
problem to another, which requires doing expensive parameter sweeps for each
new case. Here we develop on the idea of training VAEs with additional
constraints as a way to control their behaviour. We first present a detailed
theoretical analysis of constrained VAEs, expanding our understanding of how
these models work. We then introduce and analyze a practical algorithm termed
Generalized ELBO with Constrained Optimization, GECO. The main advantage of
GECO for the machine learning practitioner is a more intuitive, yet principled,
process of tuning the loss. This involves defining of a set of constraints,
which typically have an explicit relation to the desired model performance, in
contrast to tweaking abstract hyper-parameters which implicitly affect the
model behavior. Encouraging experimental results in several standard datasets
indicate that GECO is a very robust and effective tool to balance
reconstruction and compression constraints.

written in C/C++ to be free of input-dependent access patterns thus eliminating
the leakage. PRIVADO is fully-automated and has a low TCB: with zero developer
effort, given an ONNX description of a model, it generates compact and

characterizes scale-free fluctuations of gait descriptors, such as the stride
intervals during steady-state walking, depends on the well-tuned organization
of the sensorimotor controller. Gait fractality is apparent in healthy young
adults but tends to disappear in elderly individuals and neurological patients.
Therefore, its partial loss may be indicative of pathological conditions.
Despite its potential to be used as a dynamical biomarker for fall risk
assessment, the mechanistic origin of gait fractality has been investigated by
only a few studies, and even less attention has been devoted to the link
between gait fractality and gait stability. Here, we propose a novel
computational model of gait by addressing the flexibility-stability trade-off
first, and then by showing that gait fractality is a natural consequence of the
developed control mechanisms, including phase resetting and intermittent
control, which supplement instability in a linear feedback controller operated
at stability's edge. The results suggest that pathological gait, characterized
by joint-rigidity and/or loss of fractality, may be caused by dysfunction in
some of these mechanisms.

the targeted stocks. These impacts affect predators and prey of the harvested
species, as well as the whole ecosystem it inhabits. Ecosystem models can be
used to study the interactions that occur within a system, including those
between different organisms and those between fisheries and targeted species.
Trophic web models like Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) can handle fishing fleets as
a top predator, with top-down impact on harvested organisms. The aim of this
study was to better understand the Icelandic marine ecosystem and the
interactions within. This was done by constructing an EwE model of Icelandic
waters. The model was run from 1984 to 2013 and was fitted to time series of
biomass estimates, landings data and mean annual temperature. The final model
was chosen by selecting the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion.
A skill assessment was performed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient,
the coefficient of determination, the modelling efficiency and the reliability
index to evaluate the model performance. The model performed satisfactorily
when simulating previously estimated biomass and known landings. Most of the
groups with time series were estimated to have top-down control over their
prey. These are harvested species with direct and/or indirect links to lower
trophic levels and future fishing policies should take this into account. This
model could be used as a tool to investigate how such policies could impact the

entrance cost to applying ML to problems in new domains. There is a growing
divide in approaches to building systems: on the one hand, programming
leverages human experts to define a system while on the other hand behavior is
learned from data in machine learning. We propose to hybridize these two by
providing a 3-call API which we expose through an object called SmartChoice. We
describe the SmartChoices-interface, how it can be used in programming with
minimal code changes, and demonstrate that it is an easy to use but still
powerful tool by demonstrating improvements over not using ML at all on three
algorithmic problems: binary search, QuickSort, and caches. In these three
examples, we replace the commonly used heuristics with an ML model entirely
encapsulated within a SmartChoice and thus requiring minimal code changes. As
opposed to previous work applying ML to algorithmic problems, our proposed
approach does not require to drop existing implementations but seamlessly
integrates into the standard software development workflow and gives full
control to the software developer over how ML methods are applied. Our
implementation relies on standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To learn
faster, we use the heuristic function, which they are replacing, as an initial
function. We show how this initial function can be used to speed up and
stabilize learning while providing a safety net that prevents performance to
become substantially worse -- allowing for a safe deployment in critical
applications in real life.

polygonal curve $P$, consisting of $n$ vertices, by a subsequence $P'$ of $k$
vertices from $P$ such that the polygonal curves $P$ and $P'$ are as close as
possible. Closeness is usually measured using the Hausdorff or Fr\'echet
distance. These distance measures can be applied ""globally"", i.e., to the whole
curves $P$ and $P'$, or ""locally"", i.e., to each simplified subcurve and the
line segment that it was replaced with separately (and then taking the
maximum). This gives rise to four problem variants: Global-Hausdorff (known to
be NP-hard), Local-Hausdorff (in time $O(n^3)$), Global-Fr\'echet (in time $O(k
n^5)$), and Local-Fr\'echet (in time $O(n^3)$).
  Our contribution is as follows.
  - Cubic time for all variants: For Global-Fr\'echet we design an algorithm
running in time $O(n^3)$. This shows that all three problems (Local-Hausdorff,
Local-Fr\'echet, and Global-Fr\'echet) can be solved in cubic time. All these
algorithms work over a general metric space such as $(\mathbb{R}^d,L_p)$, but
the hidden constant depends on $p$ and (linearly) on $d$.
  - Cubic conditional lower bound: We provide evidence that in high dimensions
cubic time is essentially optimal for all three problems (Local-Hausdorff,
Local-Fr\'echet, and Global-Fr\'echet). Specifically, improving the cubic time
to $O(n^{3-\epsilon} \textrm{poly}(d))$ for polyline simplification over
$(\mathbb{R}^d,L_p)$ for $p = 1$ would violate plausible conjectures. We obtain
similar results for all $p \in [1,\infty), p \ne 2$.
  In total, in high dimensions and over general $L_p$-norms we resolve the
complexity of polyline simplification with respect to Local-Hausdorff,
Local-Fr\'echet, and Global-Fr\'echet, by providing new algorithms and
conditional lower bounds.

in $G$. ($H$ is rainbow if all its edges get distinct colors). The concept of
anti-Ramsey number was introduced by Erd\""os, Simanovitz, and S\'os in 1973.
Thereafter several researchers investigated this concept in the combinatorial
setting. Recently, Feng et al. revisited the anti-Ramsey problem for the
pattern graph $K_{1,t}$ (for $t \geq 3$) purely from an algorithmic point of
view due to its applications in interference modeling of wireless networks.
They posed it as an optimization problem, the maximum edge $q$-coloring
problem. For a graph $G$ and an integer $q\geq 2$, an edge $q$-coloring of $G$
is an assignment of colors to edges of $G$, such that edges incident on a
vertex span at most $q$ distinct colors. The maximum edge $q$-coloring problem
seeks to maximize the number of colors in an edge $q$-coloring of the graph
$G$. Note that the optimum value of the edge $q$-coloring problem of $G$ equals
$ar(G,K_{1,q+1})$. In this paper, we study $ar(G,K_{1,t})$, the anti-Ramsey
number of stars, for each fixed integer $t\geq 3$, both from combinatorial and
algorithmic point of view. The first of our main results presents an upper
bound for $ar(G,K_{1,q+1})$, in terms of number of vertices and the minimum
degree of $G$. The second one improves this result for the case of
triangle-free input graphs. For a positive integer $t$, let $H_t$ denote a
subgraph of $G$ with maximum number of possible edges and maximum degree $t$.
Our third main result presents an upper bound for $ar(G,K_{1,q+1})$ in terms of
$|E(H_{q-1})|$. All our results have algorithmic consequences.

linear defects on large scale. Instead planar defects appear: domain walls that
separate domains with different preferential directions of helical wave
vectors. The appearance of such domain walls in the bulk helical magnets and
some of their properties were predicted in the work \cite{Li 2012}. In a recent
work by an international team of experimenters and theorists \cite{Schoenherr

possibility of arbitrary angle between helical wave vectors. Depending on this
angle the domain walls observed in \cite{Schoenherr 2018} can be divided in two
classes: smooth and zig-zag. This article contains a mini-review of the
existing theory and experiment. It also contains new results that explain why
in a system with continuos orientation of helical wave vectors domain walls are

lattice focusing primarily on the behavior of entropy and order parameter. In
the case of traditional site percolation, we find that both the quantities are
zero at $p=0$ revealing that the system is in the perfectly ordered and in the
disordered state at the same time. Moreover, we find that entropy with $1-p$,
which is the equivalent counterpart of temperature, first increases and then
decreases again but we know that entropy with temperature cannot decrease.
However, bond percolation does not suffer from either of these two problems. To
overcome this we propose a new definition for site percolation where we occupy
sites to connect bonds and we measure cluster size by the number of bonds
connected by occupied sites. This resolves all the problems without affecting
any of the existing known results.

distribution; they are expected to follow intended protocols among
communicating services, but also to never ""get stuck"". This intuitive
requirement has been expressed by liveness properties such as progress or
(dead)lock freedom and various type systems ensure these properties for
concurrent processes. Unfortunately, very little is known about the precise
relationship between these type systems and the classes of typed processes they
induce.
  This paper puts forward the first comparative study of different type systems
for message-passing processes that guarantee deadlock freedom. We compare two
classes of deadlock-free typed processes, here denoted L and K. The class L
stands out for its canonicity: it results from Curry-Howard interpretations of
linear logic propositions as session types. The class K, obtained by encoding
session types into Kobayashi's linear types with usages, includes processes not
typable in other type systems. We show that L is strictly included in K, and
identify the precise conditions under which they coincide. We also provide two
type-preserving translations of processes in K into processes in L.

function for the samples that can significantly improve model precision. In
general, the proposed FH can be adopted in existing hashing method and achieve
more precise and stable performance compared to the original hashing method

prevent us from understanding these ubiquitous chemical processes. Information

on the graphene lattice. The dynamics of water diffusion displays remarkably
strong signatures of cooperative behaviour due to repulsive forces between the

of ice islands and, in turn, provides the opportunity for our experiments to be

is of high practical relevance for many domains, such as healthcare, public
policy and economics. Counterfactual inference enables one to answer ""What
if...?"" questions, such as ""What would be the outcome if we gave this patient
treatment $t_1$?"". However, current methods for training neural networks for
counterfactual inference on observational data are either overly complex,
limited to settings with only two available treatments, or both. Here, we
present Perfect Match (PM), a method for training neural networks for
counterfactual inference that is easy to implement, compatible with any
architecture, does not add computational complexity or hyperparameters, and
extends to any number of treatments. PM is based on the idea of augmenting
samples within a minibatch with their propensity-matched nearest neighbours.
Our experiments demonstrate that PM outperforms a number of more complex
state-of-the-art methods in inferring counterfactual outcomes across several
benchmarks, particularly in settings with many treatments.

including, but not limited to, computational complexity due to a large number
of agents, uncertainty in the functionality of each agent in the swarm, and
uncertainty in the swarm's configuration. This work generalizes the swarm state
using Random Finite Set (RFS) theory and solves a centralized control problem
with a Quasi-Newton optimization through the use of Model Predictive Control
(MPC) to overcome the aforementioned challenges. This work uses the RFS
formulation to control the distribution of agents assuming an unknown or
unspecified number of agents. Computationally efficient solutions are also
obtained via the MPC version of the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
(ILQR), a variant of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). Information
divergence is used to define the distance between the swarm RFS and the desired
swarm configuration through the use of the modified $L_2^2$ distance.
Simulation results using MPC and ILQR show that the swarm intensity converges
to the desired intensity. Additionally, the RFS control formulation is shown to
be very flexible in terms of the number of agents in the swarm and
configuration of the desired Gaussian mixtures. Lastly, the ILQR and the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density filter are used in conjunction

appear in a wide range of applications such as smart grids, robotics,
intelligent manufacture and medical monitoring. CPSs have proved resistant to
modeling due to their intrinsic complexity arising from the combination of
physical components and cyber components and the interaction between them. This
study proposes a general framework for reverse engineering CPSs directly from
data. The method involves the identification of physical systems as well as the
inference of transition logic. It has been applied successfully to a number of
real-world examples ranging from mechanical and electrical systems to medical
applications. The novel framework seeks to enable researchers to make
predictions concerning the trajectory of CPSs based on the discovered model.
Such information has been proven essential for the assessment of the
performance of CPS, the design of failure-proof CPS and the creation of design
guidelines for new CPSs.

important problems of modern physics. One way to detect these particles is to
detect the new interactions they meditate. Many experiments have been performed

generation and its associated intrinsic properties are affected in presence of
ion channel blockers by adapting Gillepie's stochastic simulation technique on
a very basic neuron of Hodgkin-Huxley type. With a simple extension of the
Hodgkin-Huxley Markov model we have mainly investigated three types of drug
blocking mechanisms and showed that the major experimental and physiological
observations such as ionic currents, spiking frequency trends, change in action
potential shape and duration, altered gating dynamics etc due to the presence
of ion channel blockers can be well reproduced. The nature of action potential
termination process in presence of sodium and potassium channel blockers are
distinct and physiologically very different from each other. Channel blockers
have distinct signatures on ionic currents. In presence of only sodium channel
blockers the frequency of action potential generation falls off exponentially
with increasing drug affinity, whereas in contrast, for only potassium channel
blockers initially an enhanced spiking activity of action potential is found
followed by a gradual decrease of the spiking frequency as the drug affinity
increases. In case of dual type blockers with equal sodium and potassium
channel binding affinity, the spiking frequency passes through maxima and
minima due to the competition between channel number fluctuation and overall
sodium and potassium conductances. We have found that sodium channel blockers
shorten the duration of action potential while the potassium channel blockers
delay it. We have also shown how the ion channel blockers alter the gating
dynamics. Some experimental results of ion channel blocking in diverse systems
have been validated through our site selected binding scheme.

immune agents often take longer time to show benefit, and the complex and
unique mechanism of action of these agents renders the use of multiple
endpoints more appropriate in some trials. These new features of immunotherapy
make conventional phase II trial designs, which assume a single binary endpoint
that is quickly ascertainable, inefficient and dysfunctional. We propose a
flexible and efficient time-to-event Bayesian optimal phase II (TOP) design.
The TOP design is efficient in that it allows real-time ""go/no-go"" interim
decision making in the presence of late-onset responses by using all available
data, and maximizes the statistical power for detecting effective treatments.
TOP is flexible in the number of interim looks and capable of handling simple
and complicated endpoints under a unified framework. We conduct simulation
studies to evaluate the operating characteristics of the TOP design.Compared to
some existing designs, the TOP design shortens the trial duration and has
higher power to detect effective treatment with well controlled type I errors.
The TOP design allows for making real-time ""go/no-go"" interim decisions in the
presence of late-onset responses, and is capable of handling various types of
endpoints under a unified framework. It is transparent and easy to implement as
its decision rules can be tabulated and included in the protocol prior to the
conduct of the trial. The TOP design provides a flexible, efficient and
easy-to-implement method to accelerate and improve the development of
immunotherapies.

these galaxies are at the distance of Pegasus I, we have found that their sizes
are intermediate among similar objects reported in the literature. In
particular, we found that three of these galaxies can be classified as
ultra-diffuse galaxies and a fourth one displays a nucleus. The eight new LSB
galaxies show a significant color dispersion around the extrapolation towards
faint luminosities of the color-magnitude relation defined by typical
early-type galaxies. In addition, they display values of the S\'ersic index
below 1, in agreement with values obtained for LSB galaxies in other
environments. We also show that there seems to be a bias effect in the size
distributions of the detected LSBs in different environments, in the sense that
more distant groups/clusters lack small $r_{eff}$ objects, while large systems
are not found in the Local Group and nearby environments. While there may be an
actual shortage of large LSB galaxies in low-density environments like the
Local Group, the non-detection of small (and faint) systems at large distances
is clearly a selection effect. As an example, LSB galaxies with similar sizes

link predictor to find the class of the unlabeled data. Different link
predictors along with Compatibility Score - a new link predictor we proposed

promising results for classifying different datasets. This paper further
improved CULP by designing an extension called CULM which uses a majority vote

different dielectric relaxation modes and two glass transition (Tg)

lower Tg is due to the motions responsible of the two relaxation modes with
highest frequencies (\mu 1H and \mu 2), which converge just at their
corresponding Tg. It is shown how the three modes follow a critical-like
description via the dynamic scaling model. The two modes with lowest
frequencies (\mu 1L and \mu 1H) are cooperative in the whole range of the

below some cross-over temperature. In terms of fragility, at the glass
transition, the ensemble (\mu 1H +\mu 2) presents a value of the steepness

intrinsic of the molecular motion itself. Finally, the steepness index seem to
have a universal behavior with temperature for the dielectric relaxation modes

of Things (IoT) networks, which consist of a large number of devices with

identify the active devices and estimate their channel state information for
effective communication. By exploiting the sparsity pattern of data
transmission, we develop a structured group sparsity estimation method to
simultaneously detect the active devices and estimate the corresponding
channels. This method significantly reduces the signature sequence length while
supporting massive IoT access. To determine the optimal signature sequence
length, we study \emph{the phase transition behavior} of the group sparsity
estimation problem. Specifically, user activity can be successfully estimated
with a high probability when the signature sequence length exceeds a threshold;
otherwise, it fails with a high probability. The location and width of the
phase transition region are characterized via the theory of conic integral
geometry. We further develop a smoothing method to solve the high-dimensional
structured estimation problem with a given limited time budget. This is
achieved by sharply characterizing the convergence rate in terms of the
smoothing parameter, signature sequence length and estimation accuracy,
yielding a trade-off between the estimation accuracy and computational cost.
Numerical results are provided to illustrate the accuracy of our theoretical
results and the benefits of smoothing techniques.

thanks to new observational results on their properties. In particular, our
early analysis of filament properties revealed a narrow distribution of median
widths centered at a value of about 0.1 pc. Here, we extend and complement our
initial study with the analysis of the filamentary structures observed in eight
nearby molecular clouds. We use the column density maps derived from Herschel
data and the DisPerSE algorithm to trace a network of filaments in each cloud.
We build synthetic maps to assess the completeness limit of our extracted
sample and validate our measurements. Our analysis yields a selected sample of
599 filaments with aspect ratios larger than 3 and column density contrasts
larger than 0.3. We show that our sample is more than 95% complete for column
density contrasts larger than 1, with only 5% of spurious detections. On
average, more than 15% of the total gas mass in the clouds, and more than 80%
of the dense gas mass, is found to be in the form of filaments, respectively.
Analysis of the radial column density profiles of the 599 filaments indicates a
narrow distribution of crest-averaged inner widths, with a median value of 0.10
pc and an interquartile range of 0.07 pc. In contrast, the filaments span wide
ranges in length, central column density, column density contrast, and mass per
unit length. The characteristic filament width is well resolved by Herschel
observations, and a median value of 0.1 pc is consistently found using three
distinct estimates based on (1) a direct measurement of the width at half power
after background subtraction, as well as (2) Gaussian and (3) Plummer fits. The
existence of a characteristic filament width is further supported by the
presence of a tight correlation between mass per unit length and central column
density for the observed filaments.

model parameters is found to be much larger than that on technical parameters
like the number of colours, boundary conditions or the lattice spacing. In a
static box, all setups lead to isotropisation through chromo-Weibel
instabilities, which is illustrated by the accompanying filamentation of the
energy density. However, the associated time scale depends strongly on the
model parameters and in all cases is longer than the phenomenologically
expected one. In the expanding system, no isotropisation is observed for any
parameter choice. We show how investigations at fixed initial energy density
can be used to better constrain some of the model parameters.

of its strong tidal interaction with Jupiter and the other Galilean Satellites,
Io is incredibly volcanically active. We use the directly measured volcanic
activity level of Io's volcanoes as a proxy for surface heat flow and compare
to tidal heating model predictions. Volcanic activity is a better proxy for
heat flow than simply the locations of volcanic constructs. We determine the
volcanic activity level using three data sets: Galileo PPR, Galileo NIMS, and
New Horizons LEISA. We also present a systematic reanalysis of the Galileo NIMS
observations to determine the 3.5 micron brightness of 51 active volcanoes. We
find that potential differences in volcanic style between high and low
latitudes make high latitude observations unreliable in distinguishing between
tidal heating models. Observations of Io's polar areas, such as those by JUNO,
are necessary to unambiguously understand Io's heat flow. However, all three of
the data sets examined show a relative dearth of volcanic brightness near 180 W
(anti-Jovian point) and the equator and the only data set with good
observations of the sub-Jovian point (LEISA) also shows a lack of volcanic
brightness in that region. These observations are more consistent with the
mantle-heating model than the asthenospheric-heating model. Furthermore, all
three of the data sets are consistent with four-fold symmetry in longitude and
peak heat flow at mid-latitudes, which best matches with the combined heating
case of Tackley et al. (2001).

networks, such as network robustness or epidemic spreading, and as a benchmark
for our models of networks, where our ability to predict percolation measures
our ability to describe the networks themselves. In many applications,
correctly identifying the phase transition of percolation on real-world
networks is of critical importance. Unfortunately, this phase transition is
obfuscated by the finite size of real systems, making it hard to distinguish
finite size effects from the inaccuracy of a given approach that fails to
capture important structural features. Here, we borrow the perspective of
smeared phase transitions and argue that many observed discrepancies are due to
the complex structure of real networks rather than to finite size effects only.
In fact, several real networks often used as benchmarks feature a smeared phase
transition where inhomogeneities in the topological distribution of the order
parameter do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit. We find that these smeared
transitions are sometimes better described as sequential phase transitions
within correlated subsystems. Our results shed light not only on the nature of
the percolation transition in complex systems, but also provide two important
insights on the numerical and analytical tools we use to study them. First, we
propose a measure of local susceptibility to better detect both clean and
smeared phase transitions by looking at the topological variability of the
order parameter. Second, we highlight a shortcoming in state-of-the-art
analytical approaches such as message passing, which can detect smeared
transitions but not characterize their nature.

of the most important yet intricate challenges of modern physics and computer

one of the most promising approaches enabling striking efficiency of simulating
static properties of one-dimensional systems and abounding numerical
applications in condensed matter theory. In higher dimensions, however, a
connection to the field of computational complexity theory has shown that the
accurate normalization of the two-dimensional tensor networks called projected
entangled pair states (PEPS) is #P-complete. Therefore, an efficient algorithm
for PEPS contraction would allow to solve exceedingly difficult combinatorial
counting problems, which is considered highly unlikely. Due to the importance
of understanding two- and three-dimensional systems the question currently
remains: Are the known constructions typical of states relevant for quantum
many-body systems? In this work, we show that an accurate evaluation of
normalization or expectation values of PEPS is as hard to compute for typical
instances as for special configurations of highest computational hardness. We
discuss the structural property of average-case hardness in relation to the

promising for improving the robustness of deep learning models. However, most
existing adversarial training approaches are based on a specific type of
adversarial attack. It may not provide sufficiently representative samples from
the adversarial domain, leading to a weak generalization ability on adversarial
examples from other attacks. Moreover, during the adversarial training,
adversarial perturbations on inputs are usually crafted by fast single-step
adversaries so as to scale to large datasets. This work is mainly focused on
the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is
difficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of
representative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately
reflect the adversarial domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel
Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method. Our intuition is to
regard the adversarial training on FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task
with limited number of target domain samples. The main idea is to learn a
representation that is semantically meaningful and domain invariant on the
clean domain as well as the adversarial domain. Empirical evaluations on
Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ATDA can greatly
improve the generalization of adversarial training and the smoothness of the
learned models, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark
datasets. To show the transfer ability of our method, we also extend ATDA to
the adversarial training on iterative attacks such as PGD-Adversial Training

  We then exhibit spectral points in the new quantum asymptotic spectra and
discuss their relations with the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. In particular,
we prove that the (fractional) real and complex Haemers bounds upper bound the
quantum Shannon capacity, which is defined as the regularization of the quantum

bounds defined over certain finite fields, which can be strictly smaller than
the quantum Shannon capacity. Moreover, since the Haemers bound can be strictly
smaller than the Lov\'asz theta function (Haemers, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory,

lateral manipulation of nanoparticles is a more suitable method to study the
dependence of friction on the crystallography of two contacting surfaces.
Still, such experiments are lacking. In this study, we combine atomic force
microscopy (AFM) based lateral manipulation and molecular dynamics simulations
in order to investigate the movements of organic needle-like nanocrystallites
grown by van der Waals epitaxy on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We
observe that nanoneedle fragments -- when pushed by an AFM tip -- do not move
along the original pushing directions. Instead, they slide on the 2D materials
preferentially along the needles' growth directions, which act as invisible
rails along commensurate directions. Further, when the nanocrystallites were
rotated by applying a torque with the AFM tip across the preferential sliding
directions, we find an increase of the torsional signal of the AFM cantilever.
We demonstrate in conjunction with simulations that both, the significant
friction anisotropy and preferential sliding directions are determined by the
complex epitaxial relation and arise from the commensurate and incommensurate
states between the organic nanocrystallites and the 2D materials.

present a Mott two-spin current resistor model which takes into account these

almost nothing about the possible existence of companion planets. Recent
evidence for metal contaminated atmospheres, circumstellar debris disks and
transiting planetary debris all indicate that planets may be likely. However,
white dwarf transit surveys are challenging due to the intrinsic faintness of
such objects, the short timescale of the transits and the low transit
probabilities due to their compact radii. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) offers a remedy to these problems as a deep, half-sky survey with fast
exposures encompassing approximately 10 million white dwarfs with $r<24.5$
apparent magnitude. We simulate LSST photometric observations of 3.5 million
white dwarfs over a ten-year period and calculate the detectability of
companion planets with $P<10$ d via transits. We find typical detection rates
in the range of $5 \times 10^{-6}$ to $4 \times 10^{-4}$ for Ceres-sized bodies
to Earth-sized worlds, yielding $\sim 50$ to $4\,000$ detections for a 100%
occurrence rate of each. For terrestrial planets in the continuously habitable
zone, we find detection rates of $\sim 10^{-3}$ indicating that LSST would
reveal hundreds of such worlds for occurrence rates in the range of 1% to 10%.

traffic assignment, in which road travelers engage in a non-cooperative
Nash-like game with departure time and route choices. DUE models describe and
predict the time-varying traffic flows on a network consistent with traffic
flow theory and travel behavior. This paper documents theoretical and numerical
advances in synthesizing traffic flow theory and DUE modeling, by presenting a
holistic computational theory of DUE with numerical implementation encapsulated
in a MATLAB software package. In particular, the dynamic network loading (DNL)
sub-problem is formulated as a system of differential algebraic equations based
on the fluid dynamic model, which captures the formation, propagation and
dissipation of physical queues as well as vehicle spillback on networks. Then,
the fixed-point algorithm is employed to solve the DUE problems on several
large-scale networks. We make openly available the MATLAB package, which can be
used to solve DUE problems on user-defined networks, aiming to not only help
DTA modelers with benchmarking a wide range of DUE algorithms and solutions,
but also offer researchers a platform to further develop their own models and
applications. Updates of the package and computational examples are available

the Haus-category is a reflective subcategory of the category of topological

show that if a morphism f:A->B is not image-dense, then the Hausdorff quotient

Instead, we model randomness under the framework of Bayesian Neural Network

$\eta^\prime$ mesons are produced with relatively low kinetic energy ($\approx$
150 MeV) since the coincident protons take over most of the momentum of the
incident-photon beam. For the C-target this allows the determination of the
real part of the $\eta^\prime$-carbon potential at low meson momenta by
comparing with collision model calculations of the $\eta^\prime$ kinetic energy
distribution and excitation function. Fitting the latter data for $\eta^\prime$
mesons going backwards in the center-of-mass system yields a potential depth of
V = $-$(44 $\pm$ 16(stat)$\pm$15(syst)) MeV, consistent with earlier
determinations of the potential depth in inclusive measurements for average

choose their curing rates to minimize the infection probability under the

movement, speech, dexterity, and cognition. Clinicians primarily diagnose
Parkinson's disease by performing a clinical assessment of symptoms. However,
misdiagnoses are common. One factor that contributes to misdiagnoses is that
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease may not be prominent at the time the
clinical assessment is performed. Here, we present a machine-learning approach
towards distinguishing between people with and without Parkinson's disease
using long-term data from smartphone-based walking, voice, tapping and memory
tests. We demonstrate that our attentive deep-learning models achieve
significant improvements in predictive performance over strong baselines (area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85) in data from a cohort
of 1853 participants. We also show that our models identify meaningful features
in the input data. Our results confirm that smartphone data collected over
extended periods of time could in the future potentially be used as a digital

logic systems that can be applied to nanotechnology has been progressing
steadily. Among the creation of nanoeletronic circuits reversible and majority
logic stand out. This paper proposes the MPC (Majority Primitives Combination)
algorithm, used for majority logic synthesis. The algorithm receives a truth
table as input and returns a majority function that covers the same set of
minterms. The formulation of a valid output function is made with the
combination of previously optimized functions. As cost criteria the algorithm
searches for a function with the least number of levels, followed by the least
number of gates, inverters, and gate inputs. In this paper it's also presented
a comparison between the MPC and the exact_mig, currently considered the best
algorithm for majority synthesis. The exact_mig encode the exact synthesis of
majority functions using the number of levels and gates as cost criteria. The
MPC considers two additional cost criteria, the number of inverters and the
number of gate inputs, with the goal to further improve exact_mig results.
Tests have shown that both algorithms return optimal solutions for all
functions with 3 input variables. For functions with 4 inputs, the MPC is able
to further improve 42,987 (66%) functions and achieves equal results for 7,198
(11%). For functions with 5 input variables, out of a sample of 1,000 randomly

equal results for 112 (11%).

and precursory signals of Chimay\'{o} geyser (New Mexico, USA) under noisy
environments. This geyser can be considered as a natural analog of
$\mathrm{CO}_2$ intrusion into shallow water aquifers. By studying this geyser,
we can understand upwelling of $\mathrm{CO}_2$-rich fluids from depth, which
has relevance to leak monitoring in a $\mathrm{CO}_2$ sequestration project. ML
methods such as Random Forests (RF) are known to be robust multi-class
classifiers and perform well under unfavorable noisy conditions. However, the
extent of the RF method's accuracy is poorly understood for this
$\mathrm{CO}_2$-driven geysering application. The current study aims to
quantify the performance of RF-classifiers to discern the geyser state. Towards
this goal, we first present the data collected from the seismometer that is
installed near the Chimay\'{o} geyser. The seismic signals collected at this
site contain different types of noises such as daily temperature variations,
seasonal trends, animal movement near the geyser, and human activity. First, we
filter the signals from these noises by combining the Butterworth-Highpass
filter and an Autoregressive method in a multi-level fashion. We show that by
combining these filtering techniques, in a hierarchical fashion, leads to
reduction in the noise in the seismic data without removing the precursors and
eruption event signals. We then use RF on the filtered data to classify the
state of geyser into three classes -- remnant noise, precursor, and eruption
states. We show that the classification accuracy using RF on the filtered data
is greater than 90\%.These aspects make the proposed ML framework attractive
for event discrimination and signal enhancement under noisy conditions, with
strong potential for application to monitoring leaks in $\mathrm{CO}_2$
sequestration.

where innovation processes are at play. Together, they represent a compelling
set of stylized facts regarding the overall statistics, the innovation rate and
the scaling of fluctuations for systems as diverse as written texts and cities,
ecological systems and stock markets. Many modeling schemes have been proposed
in literature to explain those laws, but only recently a modeling framework has
been introduced that accounts for the emergence of those laws without deducing
the emergence of one of the laws from the others or without ad hoc assumptions.
This modeling framework is based on the concept of adjacent possible space and
its key feature of being dynamically restructured while its boundaries get
explored, i.e., conditional to the occurrence of novel events. Here, we
illustrate this approach and show how this simple modelling framework,
instantiated through a modified Polya's urn model, is able reproduce Zipf's,
Heaps' and Taylor's laws within a unique self-consistent scheme. In addition
the same modelling scheme embraces other less common evolutionary laws (Hoppe's
model and Dirichlet processes) as particular cases.

and functional chemicals urgently call for effective methods for CO2
remediation and efficient metal-free catalysts for selective oxidation of
aromatic alcohol. Herein, a unique main-chain poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) is
employed as the precursor to prepare nitrogen doped micro and mesoporous
carbons via simultaneous carbonization and activation, which bear high yield,
large specific surface area above 1700 m2 per g and rich nitrogen dopant. The
porous carbon products deliver a high CO2 adsorption capacity up to 6.2 mmol
per g at 273 K and 1 bar with outstanding reversibility and satisfactory
selectivity. Besides, they work excellently as metal free carbocatalysts for
the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with high
selectivity. It is believed that this work not only provides a facile approach
to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon, but also advances the related research
in the fields of environment and catalysis.
