person into latent discriminative factors at multiple semantic levels without
manual annotation. MLFN is composed of multiple stacked blocks. Each block
contains multiple factor modules to model latent factors at a specific level,
and factor selection modules that dynamically select the factor modules to
interpret the content of each input image. The outputs of the factor selection
modules also provide a compact latent factor descriptor that is complementary
to the conventional deeply learned features. MLFN achieves state-of-the-art
results on three Re-ID datasets, as well as compelling results on the general
object categorisation CIFAR-100 dataset.

one-dimensional (1D) diffusion approach to approximate the global-mean vertical
tracer transport. The physical underpinning of the key parameter in this
framework, eddy diffusivity $K_{zz}$, is usually obscure. Here we analytically
and numerically investigate vertical tracer transport in a 3D stratified
atmosphere and predict $K_{zz}$ as a function of the large-scale circulation
strength, horizontal mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources
and sinks. We find that $K_{zz}$ increases with tracer chemical lifetime and
circulation strength but decreases with horizontal eddy mixing efficiency. We
demarcated three $K_{zz}$ regimes in planetary atmospheres. In the first regime
where the tracer lifetime is short compared with the transport timescale and
horizontal tracer distribution under chemical equilibrium ($\chi_0$) is
uniformly distributed across the globe, global-mean vertical tracer mixing
behaves diffusively. But the traditional assumption in current 1D models that
all chemical species are transported via the same eddy diffusivity generally
breaks down. We show that different chemical species in a single atmosphere
should in principle have different eddy diffusion profiles. In the second
regime where tracer is short-lived but $\chi_0$ is non-uniformly distributed, a
significant non-diffusive component might lead to a negative $K_{zz}$ under the
diffusive assumption. In the third regime where the tracer is long-lived,
global-mean vertical tracer transport is also largely influenced by
non-diffusive effects. Numerical simulations of 2D tracer transport on
fast-rotating zonally symmetric planets validate our analytical $K_{zz}$ theory
over a wide parameter space.

in particle physics is that the non-paraxial corrections to such observables as
energy, magnetic moment, scattering cross section, and so on are attenuated as
$\lambda_c^2/\sigma_{\perp}^2 \ll 1$ where $\sigma_{\perp}$ is a beam width and
$\lambda_c = \hbar/mc$ is a Compton wavelength. This amounts to less than
$10^{-14}$ for modern electron accelerators and less than $10^{-6}$ for
electron microscopes. Here we show that these corrections are $|\ell|$ times
enhanced for vortex particles with high orbital angular momenta $|\ell|\hbar$,
which can already be as large as $10^3\hbar$. We put forward the relativistic
wave packets, both for vortex bosons and fermions, which transform correctly
under the Lorentz boosts, are localized in a 3D space, and represent a
non-paraxial generalization of the Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We demonstrate that
it is $\sqrt{|\ell|}\, \lambda_c \gg \lambda_c$ that defines a paraxial scale
for such packets, in contrast to those with a non-singular phase (say, the Airy
beams). With current technology, the non-paraxial corrections can reach the
relative values of $10^{-3}$, yield a proportional increase of an invariant
mass of the electron packet, describe a spin-orbit coupling as well as the

proposed method makes its own set of restrictive assumptions about the
intervention's effects and which subpopulations to explicitly estimate.
Moreover, the majority of the literature provides no mechanism to identify
which subpopulations are the most affected--beyond manual inspection--and
provides little guarantee on the correctness of the identified subpopulations.
Therefore, we propose Treatment Effect Subset Scan (TESS), a new method for
discovering which subpopulation in a randomized experiment is most
significantly affected by a treatment. We frame this challenge as a pattern
detection problem where we efficiently maximize a nonparametric scan statistic
(a measure of the conditional quantile treatment effect) over subpopulations.
Furthermore, we identify the subpopulation which experiences the largest
distributional change as a result of the intervention, while making minimal
assumptions about the intervention's effects or the underlying data generating
process. In addition to the algorithm, we demonstrate that under the sharp null
hypothesis of no treatment effect, the asymptotic Type I and II error can be
controlled, and provide sufficient conditions for detection consistency--i.e.,
exact identification of the affected subpopulation. Finally, we validate the
efficacy of the method by discovering heterogeneous treatment effects in
simulations and in real-world data from a well-known program evaluation study.

adversarial activity, which causes the data distribution to change over time.
These changes are traditionally referred to as concept drift, and several
approaches have been developed in literature to deal with the problem of drift
handling and detection. However, most concept drift handling techniques,
approach it as a domain independent task, to make them applicable to a wide
gamut of reactive systems. These techniques were developed from an adversarial
agnostic perspective, where they are naive and assume that drift is a benign
change, which can be fixed by updating the model. However, this is not the case
when an active adversary is trying to evade the deployed classification system.
In such an environment, the properties of concept drift are unique, as the
drift is intended to degrade the system and at the same time designed to avoid
detection by traditional concept drift detection techniques. This special
category of drift is termed as adversarial drift, and this paper analyzes its
characteristics and impact, in a streaming environment. A novel framework for
dealing with adversarial concept drift is proposed, called the Predict-Detect
streaming framework. Experimental evaluation of the framework, on generated
adversarial drifting data streams, demonstrates that this framework is able to
provide reliable unsupervised indication of drift, and is able to recover from
drifts swiftly. While traditional partially labeled concept drift detection
methodologies fail to detect adversarial drifts, the proposed framework is able
to detect such drifts and operates with <6% labeled data, on average. Also, the
framework provides benefits for active learning over imbalanced data streams,
by innately providing for feature space honeypots, where minority class
adversarial samples may be captured.

adversarial aware design for classifiers, beyond fitting the model to the
training data. In such scenarios, it is necessary to make classifiers - a)
harder to evade, b) easier to detect changes in the data distribution over
time, and c) be able to retrain and recover from model degradation. While most
works in the security of machine learning has concentrated on the evasion
resistance (a) problem, there is little work in the areas of reacting to
attacks (b and c). Additionally, while streaming data research concentrates on
the ability to react to changes to the data distribution, they often take an
adversarial agnostic view of the security problem. This makes them vulnerable
to adversarial activity, which is aimed towards evading the concept drift
detection mechanism itself. In this paper, we analyze the security of machine
learning, from a dynamic and adversarial aware perspective. The existing
techniques of Restrictive one class classifier models, Complex learning models
and Randomization based ensembles, are shown to be myopic as they approach
security as a static task. These methodologies are ill suited for a dynamic
environment, as they leak excessive information to an adversary, who can
subsequently launch attacks which are indistinguishable from the benign data.
Based on empirical vulnerability analysis against a sophisticated adversary, a
novel feature importance hiding approach for classifier design, is proposed.
The proposed design ensures that future attacks on classifiers can be detected
and recovered from. The proposed work presents motivation, by serving as a
blueprint, for future work in the area of Dynamic-Adversarial mining, which
combines lessons learned from Streaming data mining, Adversarial learning and
Cybersecurity.

operating in adversarial domains are vulnerable to evasion attacks by an
adversary, who is capable of learning the behavior of the system by employing
intelligently crafted probes. Classification accuracy in such domains provides
a false sense of security, as detection can easily be evaded by carefully
perturbing the input samples. In this paper, a generic data driven framework is
presented, to analyze the vulnerability of classification systems to black box
probing based attacks. The framework uses an exploration exploitation based
strategy, to understand an adversary's point of view of the attack defense
cycle. The adversary assumes a black box model of the defender's classifier and
can launch indiscriminate attacks on it, without information of the defender's
model type, training data or the domain of application. Experimental evaluation
on 10 real world datasets demonstrates that even models having high perceived
accuracy (>90%), by a defender, can be effectively circumvented with a high
evasion rate (>95%, on average). The detailed attack algorithms, adversarial

speed improvements that allow us to train with fewer computational resources,

20 and 160 hours of data, and find that although models trained on less data
have considerably lower BLEU scores, they can still predict words with

branch of research to detect the existence of attacks or malware, there has
been much work focused on modeling the runtime behavior of a program. Stemming
from the seminal work of Forrest et al., one of the main tools to model program
behavior is system call sequences. Unfortunately, however, since mimicry
attacks were proposed, program behavior models based solely on system call
sequences could no longer ensure the security of systems and require additional
information that comes with its own drawbacks. In this paper, we report our
preliminary findings in our research to build a mimicry resilient program

  Convolutional Neural Networks","Submitted to NeuroImage",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that leads to lesions in the
central nervous system. Magnetic resonance (MR) images provide sufficient
imaging contrast to visualize and detect lesions, particularly those in the
white matter. Quantitative measures based on various features of lesions have
been shown to be useful in clinical trials for evaluating therapies. Therefore
robust and accurate segmentation of white matter lesions from MR images can
provide important information about the disease status and progression. In this
paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to
segment white matter lesions from multi-contrast MR images. The proposed CNN
based method contains two convolutional pathways. The first pathway consists of
multiple parallel convolutional filter banks catering to multiple MR
modalities. In the second pathway, the outputs of the first one are
concatenated and another set of convolutional filters are applied. The output
of this last pathway produces a membership function for lesions that may be
thresholded to obtain a binary segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated
on a dataset of 100 MS patients, as well as the ISBI 2015 challenge data
consisting of 14 patients. The comparison is performed against four publicly
available MS lesion segmentation methods. Significant improvement in
segmentation quality over the competing methods is demonstrated on various
metrics, such as Dice and false positive ratio. While evaluating on the ISBI
2015 challenge data, our method produces a score of 90.48, where a score of 90
is considered to be comparable to a human rater.

motion and interaction of dislocations, line defects of the crystalline
structure. In the microstructural (physics-based) constitutive model presented
in this paper, the main underlying microstructural processes influencing
viscoplastic deformation and mechanical properties of metals in cold and warm
regimes are statistically described by the introduced sets of postulates/axioms
for continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD). Three microstructural (internal)
state variables (MSVs) are used for statistical quantifications of different
types/species of dislocations by the notion of dislocation density. Considering
the mobility property of dislocations, they are categorized to mobile and
(relatively) immobile dislocations. Mobile dislocations carry the plastic
strain (rate), while immobile dislocations contribute to plastic hardening.
Moreover, with respect to their arrangement, dislocations are classified to
cell and wall dislocations. Cell dislocations are those that exist inside
cells/subgrains, and wall dislocations are packed in (and consequently formed)
the subgrain walls/boundaries. Therefore, the MSVs incorporated in this model
are cell mobile, cell immobile and wall immobile dislocation densities. The
evolution of these internal variables is calculated by means of adequate
equations that characterize the dislocation processes dominating material
behavior during cold and warm monotonic viscoplastic deformation. The
constitutive equations are then numerically integrated; and the constitutive
parameters are determined/fitted for a widely used ferritic-pearlitic steel
(20MnCr5).

data buffer lengths of each user in the network by using the harvested energy.
A practical uplink user rate-dependent decoding energy consumption is included
in the total energy consumption at the small cell base stations. Hence,
harvested energy is shared with both downlink and uplink users. Owing to the
non-convexity of the problem, a faster convergence sub-optimal algorithm based
on successive parametric convex approximation framework is proposed. The
algorithm is implemented in a distributed fashion, by using the alternating
direction method of multipliers, which offers not only the limited information
exchange between the base stations, but also fast convergence. Numerical

mortality class sizes. While a recent random survival forest (RSF) model
overcomes the limitations of the proportional hazard assumption, an imbalance
in the data results in an underestimation (overestimation) of the hazard of the
mortality (survival) classes. A balanced random survival forests (BRSF) model,
based on training the RSF model with data generated from a synthetic minority

studies were conducted using five datasets with different levels of class
imbalance from public repositories and an imbalanced dataset of 267 acute
cardiac patients, collected at the Heart, Artery, and Vein Center of Fresno,

strength between the survival and the mortality classes. It outperformed both
optimized Cox (without and with balancing) and RSF with an average reduction of
55\% in the prediction error over the next best alternative.

pressure-driven microchannel flow of a power-law fluid. Specifically, we
address the effect of asymmetry in the slip boundary condition at the channel
walls. Constant, uniform but unequal heat fluxes are imposed at the walls in
this thermally developed flow. The effect of asymmetric slip on the velocity
profile, on the wall shear stress, on the temperature distribution, on the
Bejan number profiles, and on the average entropy generation and the Nusselt
number are established through the numerical evaluation of exact analytical
expressions derived. Specifically, due to asymmetric slip, the fluid momentum
flux and thermal energy flux are enhanced along the wall with larger slip,
which in turn shifts the location of the velocity's maximum to an off-center
location closer to the said wall. Asymmetric slip is also shown to redistribute
the peaks and plateaus of the Bejan number profile across the microchannel,
showing a sharp transition between entropy generation due to heat transfer and
due to fluid flow at an off-center-line location. In the presence of asymmetric
slip, the difference in the imposed heat fluxes leads to starkly different
Bejan number profiles depending on which wall is hotter, and whether the fluid
is shear-thinning or shear-thickening. Overall, slip is shown to promote
uniformity in both the velocity field and the temperature field, thereby
reducing irreversibility in this flow.

the stochastic Schr\""odinger equation with weak damping and additive noise. It
proceeds as a two-level temporal parallelizable integrator with the exponential
$\theta$-scheme as the propagator on the coarse grid. The proposed algorithm in
the linear case increases the convergence order from one to $k$ for
$\theta\in[0,1]\setminus\{\frac12\}$. In particular, the convergence order
increases to $2k$ when $\theta=\frac12$ due to the symmetry of the algorithm.
Furthermore, the algorithm is proved to be suitable for longtime simulation
based on the analysis of the invariant distributions for the exponential
$\theta$-scheme. The convergence condition for longtime simulation is also
established for the proposed algorithm in the nonlinear case, which indicates
the superiority of implicit schemes. Numerical experiments are dedicated to
illustrate the best choice of the iteration number $k$, as well as the
convergence order of the algorithm for different choices of $\theta$.

analog-to-digital converter (ADC) receivers are two solutions to reduce
hardware cost and power consumption for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with large antenna arrays. In this
study, we consider a mmWave MIMO-OFDM receiver with a generalized hybrid
architecture in which a small number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and
low-resolution ADCs are employed simultaneously. Owing to the strong
nonlinearity introduced by low-resolution ADCs, the task of data detection is
challenging, particularly achieving a Bayesian optimal data detector. This
study aims to fill this gap. By using generalized expectation consistent signal
recovery technique, we propose a computationally efficient data detection
algorithm that provides a minimum mean-square error estimate on data symbols
and is extended to a mixed-ADC architecture. Considering particular structure
of MIMO-OFDM channel matirx, we provide a lowcomplexity realization in which
only FFT operation and matrixvector multiplications are required. Furthermore,
we present an analytical framework to study the theoretical performance of the
detector in the large-system limit, which can precisely evaluate the
performance expressions such as mean-square error and symbol error rate. Based
on this optimal detector, the potential of adding a few low-resolution RF
chains and high-resolution ADCs for mixed-ADC architecture is investigated.
Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and can be
used for system design rapidly. The results reveal that adding a few
low-resolution RF chains to original unquantized systems can obtain significant
gains.

exhibit distinct idle/busy frequencies, due to which the spectral access/energy

obtained by the ratio of average harvested energy and energy consumption rates.

embedding of K into the plane. Given a rational function f with degree at least
2 that is independent of K. A well known result by Beardon says that the
pre-image for any element d of the core decomposition has finitely many
components, each of which is mapped by f onto d. We show that those components
belong to the core decomposition of L, the pre-image of K under the above

is completely invariant. The previous result is also connected with a well

from K to the set of non-negative integers, such that this function is
constantly zero if and only if K is a Peano space. This function and its

environment can be considerably challenging due to the unpredictable actions of
other surrounding agents that may be cooperative or adversarial in their
interactions with the ego vehicle. One of the state-of-the-art approaches is to
apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a time-sequential driving policy, to
execute proper control strategy or tracking trajectory in dynamic situations.
However, direct application of RL algorithms is not satisfactorily enough to
deal with the cases in the autonomous driving domain, mainly due to the complex
driving environment and continuous action space. In this paper, we adopt
Q-learning as our basic learning framework and design a unique format of the
Q-function approximator that consists of neural networks to handle the
continuous action space challenge. The learning model is present in a closed
form of continuous control variables and trained in a simulation platform that
we have developed with embedded properties of real-time vehicle interactions.
The proposed algorithm avoids invoking an additional actor network that learns
to take actions, as in actor-critic algorithms. At the same time, some prior
knowledge of vehicle dynamics is also fed into the model to assist learning. We
test our algorithm with a challenging use case - lane change maneuver, to
verify the practicability and feasibility of the proposed approach. Results
from accumulated rewards and vehicle performance show that RL vehicle agents
successfully learn a safe, comfort and efficient driving policy as defined in
the reward function.

Most of the current automated driving systems developed by multiple automobile
manufacturers and suppliers are typically limited to restricted access freeways
only. Extending the automated mode to ramp merging zones presents substantial
challenges. One is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate a future
objective (e.g. a successful and smooth merge) and optimize a long-term reward
that is impacted by subsequent actions when executing the current action.
Furthermore, the merging process involves interaction between the merging
vehicle and its surrounding vehicles whose behavior may be cooperative or
adversarial, leading to distinct merging countermeasures that are crucial to
successfully complete the merge. In place of the conventional rule-based
approaches, we propose to apply reinforcement learning algorithm on the
automated vehicle agent to find an optimal driving policy by maximizing the
long-term reward in an interactive driving environment. Most importantly, in
contrast to most reinforcement learning applications in which the action space
is resolved as discrete, our approach treats the action space as well as the
state space as continuous without incurring additional computational costs. Our
unique contribution is the design of the Q-function approximation whose format
is structured as a quadratic function, by which simple but effective neural
networks are used to estimate its coefficients. The results obtained through
the implementation of our training platform demonstrate that the vehicle agent
is able to learn a safe, smooth and timely merging policy, indicating the
effectiveness and practicality of our approach.

has motivated the reanalysis of previous methods for constraining massive
astrophysical compact objects in the Milky Way halo and beyond. In order to
derive these constraints, a model for the dark matter distribution around the
Milky Way must be used. Previous microlensing searches have assumed a
semi-isothermal density sphere for this task. We show this model is no longer
consistent with data from the Milky Way rotation curve, and test two
replacement models, namely NFW and power-law. The power-law model is the most
flexible as it can break spherical symmetry, and best fits the data. Thus, we
recommend the power-law model as a replacement, although it still lacks the
flexibility to fully encapsulate all possible shapes of the Milky Way halo. We
then use the power-law model to rederive some previous microlensing constraints
in the literature, while propagating the primary halo-shape uncertainties
through to our final constraints. Our analysis reveals that the microlensing
constraints towards the Large Magellanic Cloud weaken somewhat for MACHO masses
around $10\, M_\odot$ when this uncertainty is taken into account, but the
constraints tighten at lower masses. Exploring some of the simplifying
assumptions of previous constraints we also study the effect of wide mass
distributions of compact halo objects, as well as the effect of spatial
clustering on microlensing constraints. We find that both effects induce a
shift in the constraints towards smaller masses, and can effectively remove the
microlensing constraints from $M \sim 1-10 M_\odot$ for certain MACHO
populations.

unsupervised domain adaptation, specific for partial domain adaptation where
the target domain has less number of classes compared to the source domain.
Previous domain adaptation methods generally assume the identical label spaces,
such that reducing the distribution divergence leads to feasible knowledge
transfer. However, such an assumption is no longer valid in a more realistic
scenario that requires adaptation from a larger and more diverse source domain
to a smaller target domain with less number of classes. This paper extends the
adversarial nets-based domain adaptation and proposes a novel adversarial

are potentially from the outlier classes and, at the same time, reduce the

with great success. However, there are a number of limitations of the current
CNN based image recognition paradigm. First, the receptive field of CNN is
generally fixed, which limits its recognition capacity when the input image is
very large. Second, it lacks the computational scalability for dealing with
images with different sizes. Third, it is quite different from human visual
system for image recognition, which involves both feadforward and recurrent
proprocessing. This paper proposes a different paradigm of image recognition,
which can take advantages of variable scales of the input images, has more
computational scalabilities, and is more similar to image recognition by human
visual system. It is based on recurrent neural network (RNN) defined on image
scale with an embeded base CNN, which is named Scale Recurrent Neural
Network(SRNN). This RNN based approach makes it easier to deal with images with
variable sizes, and allows us to borrow existing RNN techniques, such as LSTM
and GRU, to further enhance the recognition accuracy. Our experiments show that
the recognition accuracy of a base CNN can be significantly boosted using the
proposed SRNN models. It also significantly outperforms the scale ensemble
method, which integrate the results of performing CNN to the input image at
different scales, although the computational overhead of using SRNN is
negligible.

Likelihood. Our algorithm first samples small, gap-free alignments involving
four taxa each. For each of these alignments, it then calculates a quartet tree

plagued by poor behavior of the global convergence mechanism. To confront this
issue, we propose the use of an exact penalty function with a dynamic penalty

prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the strategy does not modify the

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve the throughput of all network

a transmit time-switching (transmit-TS) protocol. We formulate two important
beamfoming problems of users' max-min throughput optimization and energy
efficiency maximization under power constraint and energy harvesting thresholds

energy harvesting are non-convex in beamforming vectors. Thus, we develop
efficient path-following algorithms to solve them. In addition, we also
consider conventional power splitting (PS)-based energy harvesting receiver.

that all considered mutation-based algorithms show a similar dichotomy for
HotTopic functions, or even for all monotone functions. For the
$(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA, this dichotomy is in the parameter $c\gamma$, which
is the expected number of bit flips in an individual after mutation and
crossover, neglecting selection. For the fast algorithms, the dichotomy is in
$m_2/m_1$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the first and second falling moment of the

to answer a question that depends on the context. Such a problem requires to

Lately, attention mechanisms have been found to be quite successful at these
tasks and in particular, attention mechanisms with attention flow from both
context-to-question and question-to-context have been proven to be quite
useful. In this paper, we study two state-of-the-art attention mechanisms
called Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BiDAF) and Dynamic Co-Attention Network
(DCN) and propose a hybrid scheme combining these two architectures that gives
better overall performance. Moreover, we also suggest a new simpler attention
mechanism that we call Double Cross Attention (DCA) that provides better
results compared to both BiDAF and Co-Attention mechanisms while providing
similar performance as the hybrid scheme. The objective of our paper is to
focus particularly on the attention layer and to suggest improvements on that.
Our experimental evaluations show that both our proposed models achieve
superior results on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) compared to
BiDAF and DCN attention mechanisms.

which interacts with the hydrogen electron. A simple analyze shows that this
interaction between the hydrogen momentum and the electron is of order of
$\alpha^3\frac{v}{c}m$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $v$ is
the atom velocity, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m$ is the electron mass.
Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the two velocity-dependent operators of this
order are derived for the hydrogen velocity $\frac{v}{c}<<\alpha$. As well
known, the degeneracy of the energy levels with the same principal quantum
number, $n$, and the same quantum number of the total angular momentum, $j$,
but the different orbital angular momenta $l=j\pm 1/2$ is removed by the
radiative corrections (the Lamb shift) that are proportional to $\alpha^{5}m$.
It is shown that the velocity-dependent perturbation interactions remove this
degeneracy as well. There is, however, an important difference between the Lamb
shifts and the energy-levels shifts induced by the atom motion. The Lamb shift
is the diagonal correction to the energy separately for each of the degenerate
states. The the velocity-dependent perturbation interactions result in the
off-diagonal energy corrections between the mutually degenerate states. The
joint effect of these two perturbations which are essentially different in
their origin, is analyzed. Given their order of magnitude, the crossover from
the Lamb shifts to the motion-induced shifts should occur at the atom velocity
$v=k\alpha^2 c$, where $k>>1$ is a numerical factor depended on $n$ and $j$. An
experiment used the orbital motion of the Earth, is proposed to test the theory
developed.

catalog contains 6617 objects with high-quality spectra (two or more spectral
features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by
the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects we could not obtain
reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input
catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a
diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the
galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at
I_AB~23 and K_AB~21, with a secondary peak at K_AB~24. We sample a broad
redshift distribution in the range 0<z<6, with one peak at z~1, and another one
around z~4. We have identified 13 redshift spikes at z>0.65 with chance
probabilities <4xE-4$, some of which are clearly related to protocluster
structures of sizes >10 Mpc. An object-to-object comparison with a multitude of
other spectroscopic samples in the same field shows that our DEIMOS sample is
among the best in terms of fraction of spectroscopic failures and relative
redshift accuracy. We have determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to
about 0.8% in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well
below the most pessimistic expectations. Interestingly, we find evidence for
strong lensing of Ly-alpha background emitters within the slits of 12 of our
target galaxies, increasing their apparent density by about a factor of 4.

  Declaration","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millions of shipping containers filled with goods move around the world every
day. Before such a container may enter a trade bloc, the customs agency of the
goods' destination country must ensure that it does not contain illegal or
mislabeled goods. Due to the high volume of containers, customs agencies make a
selection of containers to audit through a risk analysis procedure. Customs
agencies perform risk analysis using data sourced from a centralized system
that is potentially vulnerable to manipulation and malpractice. Therefore we
propose an alternative: DEFenD, a decentralized system that stores data about
goods and containers in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. In our system,
economic operators make claims to the network about goods they insert into or
remove from containers, and encrypt these claims so that they can only be read
by the destination country's customs agency. Economic operators also make
unencrypted claims about containers with which they interact. Unencrypted
claims can be validated by the entire network of customs agencies. Our key
contribution is a data partitioning scheme and several protocols that enable
such a system to utilize blockchain and its powerful validation principle,
while also preserving the privacy of the involved economic operators. Using our
protocol, customs agencies can improve their risk analysis and economic
operators can get through customs with less delay. We also present a reference
implementation built with Hyperledger Fabric and analyze to what extent our
implementation meets the requirements in terms of privacy-preservation,
security, scalability, and decentralization.

science applications where it is necessary to reduce large problems into a

use a multilevel approach wherein an initial partitioning is performed after
compressing the hypergraph to a predetermined level. This level is typically
chosen to produce very coarse hypergraphs in which heuristic algorithms are
fast and effective. This article presents a novel memetic algorithm which
remains effective on larger initial hypergraphs. This enables the exploitation
of information that can be lost during coarsening and results in improved final
solution quality. We use this algorithm to present an empirical analysis of the
space of possible initial hypergraphs in terms of its searchability at
different levels of coarsening. We find that the best results arise at
coarsening levels unique to each hypergraph. Based on this, we introduce an
adaptive scheme that stops coarsening when the rate of information loss in a
hypergraph becomes non-linear and show that this produces further improvements.
The results show that we have identified a valuable role for evolutionary

function, namely $k\in L^1(\R^+)$, but its time derivative is not integrable,
that is $\dot k\notin L^1(\R^+)$. Notably, also under these relaxed assumptions
on $k$, whenever the heat flux is the same also the related thermal work is the

separation of $\sim$111 mas from the central star, and at an average position
angle of $\sim$165.5 degrees. We have performed simultaneous adaptive optics
observations of MWC758 in the H$_{\alpha}$ line and the adjacent continuum

the target. The derived contrast curve in the B_Ha filter allows us to derive a
5$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim$7.6 mag at 111 mas, the separation of the
previously detected planet candidate. This contrast translates into a
H$_{\alpha}$ line luminosity of $L_{\rm H_{\alpha}}\lesssim$ 5$\times$10$^{-5}$
$L_{\odot}$ at 111 mas, and an accretion luminosity of $L_{acc}
<$3.7$\times$10$^{-4}\,L_{\odot}$. For the predicted mass range of MWC758b,
0.5-5 $M_{\rm Jup}$, this implies accretion rates of $\dot M \lesssim$
3.4$\times$(10$^{-8}$-10$^{-9})\,M_{\odot}/yr$, for an average planet radius of
1.1 $R_{\rm Jup}$. Therefore, our estimates are consistent with the predictions
of accreting circumplanetary accretion models for $R_{\rm in} = 1 R_{\rm Jup}$.
In any case, the non-detection of any H$_{\alpha}$ emitting source in the
ZIMPOL images does not allow us to unveil the true nature of the $L'$ detected
source.

variable formula, for smooth functionals of continuous paths with arbitrary
regularity defined in terms of the notion of $p$-th variation along a sequence
of time partitions. For paths with finite $p$-th variation along a sequence of
time partitions, we derive a change of variable formula for $p$ times
continuously differentiable functions and show pointwise convergence of
appropriately defined compensated Riemann sums. Results for functions are
extended to regular path-dependent functionals using the concept of vertical
derivative of a functional. We show that the pathwise integral satisfies an
`isometry' formula in terms of $p$-th order variation and obtain a `signal plus
noise' decomposition for regular functionals of paths with strictly increasing
$p$-th variation. For less regular ($C^{p-1}$) functions we obtain a
Tanaka-type change of variable formula using an appropriately defined notion of
local time. These results extend to multidimensional paths and yield a natural
higher-order extension of the concept of `reduced rough path'. We show that,
while our integral coincides with a rough-path integral for a certain rough
path, its construction is canonical and does not involve the specification of
any rough-path superstructure.

  Reduction","24 Pages and 7 Tables",,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently a new algorithm for model reduction of second order linear dynamical
systems with proportional damping, the Adaptive Iterative Rational Global
Arnoldi (AIRGA) algorithm (Bonin et. al., 2016), has been proposed. The main
computational cost of the AIRGA algorithm is solving a sequence of linear
systems. Usually, direct methods (e.g., LU) are used for solving these systems.
As model sizes grow, direct methods become prohibitively expensive. Iterative
methods (e.g., Krylov) scale well with size, and hence, are a good choice with
an appropriate preconditioner.
  Preconditioned iterative methods introduce errors in linear solves because
they are not exact. They solve linear systems up to a certain tolerance. We
prove that, under mild conditions, the AIRGA algorithm is backward stable with
respect to the errors introduced by these inexact linear solves. Our first
assumption is use of a Ritz-Galerkin based solver that satisfies few extra
orthogonality conditions. Since Conjugate Gradient (CG) is the most popular
method based upon the Ritz-Galerkin theory, we use it. We show how to modify CG
to achieve these extra orthogonalities.
  Modifying CG with the suggested changes is non-trivial. Hence, we demonstrate
that using Recycling CG (RCG) helps us achieve these orthogonalities with no
code changes. The extra cost of orthogonalizations is often offset by savings
because of recycling. Our second and third assumptions involve existence,
invertibility and boundedness of two matrices, which are easy to satisfy.
  While satisfying the backward stability assumptions, by numerical experiments
we show that as we iteratively solve the linear systems arising in the AIRGA
algorithm more accurately, we obtain a more accurate reduced system. We also
show that recycling Krylov subspaces helps satisfy the backward stability
assumptions (extra-orthogonalities) at almost no extra cost.

mobile-edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm by providing
computing capabilities within radio access networks in close proximity.
Nevertheless, the design of computation offloading policies for a MEC system
remains challenging. Specifically, whether to execute an arriving computation
task at local mobile device or to offload a task for cloud execution should
adapt to the environmental dynamics in a smarter manner. In this paper, we
consider MEC for a representative mobile user in an ultra dense network, where
one of multiple base stations (BSs) can be selected for computation offloading.
The problem of solving an optimal computation offloading policy is modelled as
a Markov decision process, where our objective is to minimize the long-term
cost and an offloading decision is made based on the channel qualities between
the mobile user and the BSs, the energy queue state as well as the task queue
state. To break the curse of high dimensionality in state space, we propose a
deep $Q$-network-based strategic computation offloading algorithm to learn the
optimal policy without having a priori knowledge of the dynamic statistics.
Numerical experiments provided in this paper show that our proposed algorithm
achieves a significant improvement in average cost compared with baseline
policies.
