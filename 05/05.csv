  varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapies",,,,,"stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The analysis of adverse events (AEs) is a key component in the assessment of
a drug's safety profile. Inappropriate analysis methods may result in
misleading conclusions about a therapy's safety and consequently its
benefit-risk ratio. The statistical analysis of AEs is complicated by the fact
that the follow-up times can vary between the patients included in a clinical
trial. This paper takes as its focus the analysis of AE data in the presence of
varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapeutic
interventions. Instead of approaching this issue directly and solely from an
analysis point of view, we first discuss what should be estimated in the
context of safety data, leading to the concept of estimands. Although the
current discussion on estimands is mainly related to efficacy evaluation, the
concept is applicable to safety endpoints as well. Within the framework of
estimands, we present statistical methods for analysing AEs with the focus
being on the time to the occurrence of the first AE of a specific type. We give
recommendations which estimators should be used for the estimands described.
Furthermore, we state practical implications of the analysis of AEs in clinical
trials and give an overview of examples across different indications. We also
provide a review of current practices of health technology assessment (HTA)
agencies with respect to the evaluation of safety data. Finally, we describe
problems with meta-analyses of AE data and sketch possible solutions.

meaning and propose their generalization in a systematic manner within the
framework of quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate with an example of
the subsystem Bacon-Shor code that the ungauging procedure can result in models
with unusual symmetry operators constrained to live on lower-dimensional
structures. We apply our formalism to the three-dimensional gauge color code
(GCC) and show that its codeword space is equivalent to the Hilbert space of
six copies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with $1$-form symmetries. We
find that three different stabilizer Hamiltonians associated with the GCC
correspond to distinct thermal symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in
the presence of the stabilizer symmetries of the GCC. One of the considered
Hamiltonians describes the Raussendorf-Bravyi-Harrington model, which is
universal for measurement-based quantum computation at non-zero temperature. We
also propose a general procedure of creating $D$-dimensional SPT Hamiltonians
from $(D+1)$-dimensional CSS stabilizer Hamiltonians by exploiting a relation
between gapped domain walls and transversal logical gates. As a result, we find
an explicit two-dimensional realization of a non-trivial fracton SPT phase
protected by fractal-like symmetries.

dwarfs our proper motion estimate is the first ever provided. The adopted
astrometric data come from the second data release of the Gaia mission. We
determine the mean proper motion for each galaxy starting from an initial guess
of likely members, based either on radial velocity measurements or using stars
on the Horizontal Branch identified in the Gaia ($G_{\rm BP}$-$G_{\rm RP}$,$G$)
colour-magnitude diagram in the field of view towards the UFD. We then refine
their membership iteratively using both astrometry and photometry. We take into
account the full covariance matrix among the astrometric parameters when
deriving the mean proper motions for these systems. Our procedure provides mean
proper motions with typical uncertainties of $\sim0.1$ mas/yr, even for
galaxies without prior spectroscopic information. In the case of Segue 2 we
find that using radial velocity members only leads to biased results,
presumably because of the small number of stars with measured radial
velocities. Our procedure allows to maximize the number of member stars per
galaxy regardless of the existence of prior spectroscopic information, and can
therefore be applied on any faint or distant stellar system within reach of
Gaia.

a large conversion efficiency, the scalability down to the nanometer scale and
the integrability with opto-electronic and spintronic devices. Here we show

Observatory has analyzed the TeV cosmic-ray sky over an energy range between

located at high altitude in the state of Puebla, Mexico. Using 300 light-tight
water tanks, it collects the Cherenkov light from the particles of extensive
air showers from primary gamma rays and cosmic rays. This detection method
allows for uninterrupted observation of the entire overhead sky (2~sr
instantaneous, 8.5~sr integrated) in the energy range from a few TeV to
hundreds of TeV. Like other detectors in the northern and southern hemisphere,
HAWC observes an energy-dependent anisotropy in the arrival direction
distribution of cosmic rays. The observed cosmic-ray anisotropy is dominated by
a dipole moment with phase $\alpha\approx40^{\circ}$ and amplitude that slowly
rises in relative intensity from $8\times10^{-4}$ at 2 TeV to $14\times10^{-4}$
around 30.3 TeV, above which the dipole decreases in strength. A significant
large-scale ($>60^{\circ}$ in angular extent) signal is also observed in the
quadrupole and octupole moments, and significant small-scale features are also
present, with locations and shapes consistent with previous observations.
Compared to previous measurements in this energy range, the HAWC cosmic-ray sky
maps improve on the energy resolution and fit precision of the anisotropy.
These data can be used in an effort to better constrain local cosmic-ray
accelerators and the intervening magnetic fields.

transition metal oxide compounds, in particular at the surface, affecting
fundamental physical properties and functionalities of the hosting materials.
Here we investigate via first-principle techniques the formation and dynamics
of small polarons on the reduced surface of titanium dioxide, an archetypal
system for polarons, for a wide range of oxygen vacancy concentrations. We
report how the essential features of polarons can be adequately accounted in
terms of few quantities: the local structural and chemical environment, the
attractive interaction between negatively charged polarons and positively
charged oxygen vacancies, and the spin-dependent polaron-polaron Coulomb
repulsion. We combined molecular dynamics simulations on realistic samples
derived from experimental observations with simplified static models, aiming to
disentangle the various variables at play. We find that depending on the
specific trapping site, different types of polarons can be formed, with
distinct orbital symmetries and different degree of localization and structural
distortion. The energetically most stable polaron site is the subsurface Ti
atom below the undercoordinated surface Ti atom, owing to a small energy cost
to distort the lattice and a suitable electrostatic potential. Polaron-polaron
repulsion and polaron-vacancy attraction determine the spatial distribution of
polarons as well as the energy of the polaronic in-gap state. In the range of
experimentally reachable oxygen vacancy concentrations the calculated data are
in excellent agreement with observations, thus validating the overall
interpretation.

Hund coupling $J$, focusing on the case with $J>0$. Using Jastrow-Slater wave
functions, we consider both states with and without magnetic/orbital order.
Electron pairing can also be included in the wave function, in order to detect
the occurrence of superconductivity for generic electron densities $n$. When no
magnetic/orbital order is considered, the Mott transition is continuous for
$n=1$ (quarter filling); instead, at $n=2$ (half filling), it is first order
for small values of $J/U$, while it turns out to be continuous when the ratio
$J/U$ is increased. A significant triplet pairing is present in a broad region
around $n=2$. By contrast, singlet superconductivity (with $d$-wave symmetry)
is detected only for small values of the Hund coupling and very close to half
filling. When including magnetic and orbital order, the Mott insulator acquires
antiferromagnetic order for $n=2$; instead, for $n=1$ the insulator has
ferromagnetic and antiferro-orbital orders. In the latter case, a metallic
phase is present for small values of $U/t$ and the metal-insulator transition
becomes first order. In the region with $1<n<2$, we observe that ferromagnetism
(with no orbital order) is particularly robust for large values of the Coulomb
repulsion and that triplet superconductivity is strongly suppressed by the
presence of antiferromagnetism. The case with $J=0$, which has an enlarged
SU(4) symmetry due to the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of
freedom, is also analyzed.

is a bright star ($V = 9.3$ mag) observed by the K2 mission with one-minute
time sampling. It exhibits solar-like oscillations. We conducted
asteroseismology to determine the parameters of the star, finding the mass and
radius to be $1.12^{+0.04}_{-0.01}~M_\odot$ and
$1.657^{+0.020}_{-0.004}~R_\odot$, respectively. The star appears to have
recently left the main sequence, based on the inferred age,
$9.4^{+0.4}_{-1.3}~\mathrm{Gyr}$, and the non-detection of mixed modes. The
star hosts a ""warm Saturn"" ($P = 11.8$~days, $R_p = 6.86 \pm 0.14~R_\oplus$).
Radial-velocity follow-up observations performed with the FIES, HARPS, and
HARPS-N spectrographs show that the planet has a mass of $35.7 \pm
3.3~M_\oplus$. The data also show that the planet's orbit is eccentric
($e\approx 0.2$). An investigation of the rotational splitting of the
oscillation frequencies of the star yields no conclusive evidence on the
stellar inclination angle. We further obtained Rossiter-McLaughlin
observations, which result in a broad posterior of the stellar obliquity. The
planet seems to conform to the same patterns that have been observed for other
sub-Saturns regarding planet mass and multiplicity, orbital eccentricity, and

However, in many real applications, data may consist many unknown confounding
factors or they just come from different resources. Thus, there might be some
heterogeneous dependency across the whole population and divide them into
different groups. For example, there exists several subtypes across the
population with breast cancer with different gene interaction mechanisms for
each subtype group. In this setting, constructing a single model using all
observations ignores the difference between groups while estimating multiple
models for each group is infeasible due to the unknown group classification. To
deal with this problem, we proposed a mixture envelope model which construct a
groupwise model for heterogeneous data and simultaneously classify them into
different groups by an Imputation-Conditional Consistency (ICC) algorithm.

treatment to judges setting bail, machine learning algorithms have been shown
to outperform expert human judgments. One complication, however, is that it is
often difficult to anticipate the effects of algorithmic policies prior to
deployment, making the decision to adopt them risky. In particular, one
generally cannot use historical data to directly observe what would have
happened had the actions recommended by the algorithm been taken. One standard
strategy is to model potential outcomes for alternative decisions assuming that
there are no unmeasured confounders (i.e., to assume ignorability). But if this
ignorability assumption is violated, the predicted and actual effects of an
algorithmic policy can diverge sharply. In this paper we present a flexible,
Bayesian approach to gauge the sensitivity of predicted policy outcomes to
unmeasured confounders. We show that this policy evaluation problem is a
generalization of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in observational
studies, and so our methods can immediately be applied to that setting.
Finally, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that under certain
conditions it is possible to construct near-optimal algorithmic policies even
when ignorability is violated. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on a
large dataset of judicial actions, in which one must decide whether defendants
awaiting trial should be required to pay bail or can be released without
payment.

subgroup. We assume that k_0 is a large field, for example, k_0 is either the
field R of real numbers or a p-adic field. Let G_0 be a quasi-split k_0-form of
G. We show that if H has self-normalizing normalizer, and Gal(k/k_0) preserves
the combinatorial invariants of G/H, then H is conjugate to a subgroup defined
over k_0, and hence, the G-variety G/H admits a G_0-equivariant k_0-form. In
the case when G_0 is not assumed to be quasi-split, we give a necessary and

G_0-equivariant k_0-form of G/H.

performance of optical systems. Measuring it is costly and it is thus rarely
available for a given lens specimen. Instead, MTFs based on simulations or, at
best, MTFs measured on other specimens of the same lens are used. Fortunately,
images recorded through an optical system contain ample information about its
MTF, only that it is confounded with the statistics of the images. This work
presents a method to estimate the MTF of camera lens systems directly from
photographs, without the need for expensive equipment. We use a custom grid
display to accurately measure the point response of lenses to acquire ground
truth training data. We then use the same lenses to record natural images and
employ a data-driven supervised learning approach using a convolutional neural
network to estimate the MTF on small image patches, aggregating the information
into MTF charts over the entire field of view. It generalises to unseen lenses
and can be applied for single photographs, with the performance improving if
multiple photographs are available.

requires additionally that the matchings used be all feasible in the sense of
the physical interference model. Sometimes the resulting optimal covering of
$G$'s edge set by feasible matchings is simply a partition of the edge set. In
such cases, the index $\chi'^*_\mathrm{phys}(G)$ becomes the particular case
that we denote by $\chi'_\mathrm{phys}(G)$, a similar modification of $G$'s
well-known chromatic index. We formulate the exact computation of
$\chi'^*_\mathrm{phys}(G)$ as a linear programming problem, which we solve for
an extensive collection of random geometric graphs used to instantiate networks
in the physical interference model. We have found that, depending on node
density (number of nodes per unit deployment area), often $G$ is such that
$\chi'^*_\mathrm{phys}(G)<\chi'_\mathrm{phys}(G)$. This bespeaks the
possibility of increased network capacity by virtue of simply defining it so
that edges are colored in the fractional, rather than the integer, sense.

measurable imprint on the gravitational waves they emit. The induced stellar
multipoles are an added source of gravitational radiation and modify the
orbital dynamics, producing a slight acceleration of the coalescence which
manifests as a phase shift in the waveform relative to point-particles. The
dominant piece of this tidal phase comes from the mass quadrupoles, which
contribute at fifth post-Newtonian order (5PN). Current quadrupoles and mass
octupoles contribute at higher orders. For spinning neutron stars, additional
multipole moments are induced by nonlinear couplings between spin and tides. We
calculate these rotational-tidal deformations assuming the stars are rotating
slowly and the tides are weak and quasi-stationary. The stellar multipole
moments are read off from an asymptotically flat metric that encodes the
difference between their tidal response and a black hole's. The multipoles are
subsequently inserted into post-Newtonian formulas for the orbit and the
gravitational radiation. We find that, at leading order, the rotational-tidal
deformations make a 6.5PN contribution to the tidal phase. Their effect on the
waveform is thus larger than that of the mass octupoles, and nearly as large as
that of the current quadrupoles, in systems with non-negligible spin.

encoded using an erasure code, for instance, a Reed-Solomon (RS) code. We
consider the problem of repairing a single node or multiple nodes in RS-coded
storage systems using the smallest possible amount of inter-nodal
communication. According to the cut-set bound, communication cost of repairing
$h\ge 1$ failed nodes for an $(n,k=n-r)$ MDS code using $d$ helper nodes is at
least $dhl/(d+h-k),$ where $l$ is the size of the node. Guruswami and Wootters
(2016) initiated the study of efficient repair of RS codes, showing that they
can be repaired using a smaller bandwidth than under the trivial approach. At
the same time, their work as well as follow-up papers stopped short of
constructing RS codes (or any scalar MDS codes) that meet the cut-set bound
with equality.
  In this paper we construct families of RS codes that achieve the cutset bound
for repair of one or several nodes. In the single-node case, we present RS
codes of length $n$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_{q^l},l=\exp((1+o(1))n\log n)$
that meet the cut-set bound. We also prove an almost matching lower bound on
$l$, showing that super-exponential scaling is both necessary and sufficient
for scalar MDS codes to achieve the cut-set bound using linear repair schemes.
For the case of multiple nodes, we construct a family of RS codes that achieve
the cut-set bound universally for the repair of any $h=2,3,\dots$ failed nodes
from any subset of $d$ helper nodes, $k\le d\le n-h.$ For a fixed number of
parities $r$ the node size of the constructed codes is close to the smallest
possible node size for codes with such properties.

additive and it can be computed by means of generalised hydrodynamics.
Conversely, additivity is lost when the initial state is not quasistationary;
yet the entanglement entropy in the large-scale limit can be exactly predicted
in the quasiparticle picture, provided that the initial state is low entangled.

of data being missing at random (MAR). However, for missing data generated by
missing not at random (MNAR) mechanisms, MI performed assuming MAR might not be
satisfactory. For an incomplete variable in a given dataset, its corresponding
population marginal distribution might also be available in an external data
source. We show how this information can be readily utilised in the imputation
model to calibrate inference to the population, by incorporating an
appropriately calculated offset termed the `calibrated-$\delta$ adjustment'. We
describe the derivation of this offset from the population distribution of the
incomplete variable and show how in applications it can be used to closely (and
often exactly) match the post-imputation distribution to the population level.
Through analytic and simulation studies, we show that our proposed
calibrated-$\delta$ adjustment MI method can give the same inference as
standard MI when data are MAR, and can produce more accurate inference under
two general MNAR missingness mechanisms. The method is used to impute missing
ethnicity data in a type 2 diabetes prevalence case study using UK primary care
electronic health records, where it results in scientifically relevant changes
in inference for non-White ethnic groups compared to standard MI.
Calibrated-$\delta$ adjustment MI represents a pragmatic approach for utilising

physical framework. The current paradigm is that the corona is heated by
nanoflares, which were originally proposed as miniature versions of the
observed solar flares. It was recently suggested that the nanoflares could be
identified as annihilation events of the nuggets from the Axion Quark Nugget
(AQN) dark matter model. This model was invented as an explanation of the
observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$, based only on
cosmological and particle physics considerations. In this new paradigm, the AQN
particles moving through the coronal plasma and annihilating with normal matter
can lead to the drastic change of temperatures seen in the Sun's Transition
Region (TR), and significantly contribute to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
excess of $10^{27}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. To test this proposal, we perform
numerical simulations with a realistically modeled AQN particle distribution
and explore how the nuggets interact with the coronal plasma. Remarkably, our
simulations predict the correct energy budget for the solar corona, and show
that the energy injection mostly occurs at an altitude of around 2000 km, which
is where the TR lies. Therefore, we propose that these long unresolved
mysteries could be two sides of the same coin. We make several predictions
based on this proposal, some of which could be tested by the recently launched

galaxies using CanariCam on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. These
observations reveal a diverse set of physical processes responsible for the
nuclear polarization, and permit characterization of the origin of the MIR
nuclear polarimetric signature of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For all radio
quiet objects, we found that the nuclear polarization is low (<1 per cent), and
the degree of polarization is often a few per cent over extended regions of the
host galaxy where we have sensitivity to detect such extended emission (i.e.,
NGC 1068 and NGC 4151). We suggest that the higher degree of polarization
previously found in lower resolution data arises only on the
larger-than-nuclear scales. Only the radio-loud Cygnus A exhibits significant
nuclear polarization ($\sim$11 per cent), attributable to synchrotron emission
from the pc-scale jet close to the core. We present polarization models that
suggest that the MIR nuclear polarization for highly obscured objects arises
from a self-absorbed MIR polarized clumpy torus and/or dichroism from the host
galaxy, while for unabsorbed cores, MIR polarization arises from dust
scattering in the torus and/or surrounding nuclear dust.

which are found only in cool-core clusters. In this paper, we present the first
discovery of a cool-core cluster with an associated mini halo that also shows
ultra-steep-spectrum emission extending well beyond the core that resembles
radio halo emission. The large-scale component is discovered thanks to LOFAR
observations at 144 MHz. We also analyse GMRT observations at 610 MHz to
characterise the spectrum of the radio emission. An X-ray analysis reveals that
the cluster is slightly disturbed, and we suggest that the steep-spectrum radio
emission outside the core could be produced by a minor merger that powers
electron re-acceleration without disrupting the cool core. This discovery
suggests that, under particular circumstances, both a mini and giant halo could
co-exist in a single cluster, opening new perspectives for particle
acceleration mechanisms in galaxy clusters.

regions of planetary systems. Here we report new ALMA observations of the
80-200 Myr old Solar analogue HD 107146 that reveal the radial structure of its
exo-Kuiper belt at wavelengths of 1.1 and 0.86 mm. We find that the
planetesimal disc is broad, extending from 40 to 140 au, and it is
characterised by a circular gap extending from 60 to 100 au in which the
continuum emission drops by about 50%. We also report the non-detection of the
CO J=3-2 emission line, confirming that there is not enough gas to affect the
dust distribution. To date, HD 107146 is the only gas-poor system showing
multiple rings in the distribution of millimeter sized particles. These rings
suggest a similar distribution of the planetesimals producing small dust grains
that could be explained invoking the presence of one or more perturbing
planets. Because the disk appears axisymmetric, such planets should be on
circular orbits. By comparing N-body simulations with the observed visibilities
we find that to explain the radial extent and depth of the gap, it would be
required the presence of multiple low mass planets or a single planet that
migrated through the disc. Interior to HD 107146's exo-Kuiper belt we find
extended emission with a peak at ~20 au and consistent with the inner warm belt
that was previously predicted based on 22$\mu$m excess as in many other
systems. This warm belt is the first to be imaged, although unexpectedly
suggesting that it is asymmetric. This could be due to a large belt
eccentricity or due to clumpy structure produced by resonant trapping with an

established pathway is through Kondo effect in metallic non-magnetic analogues.
Here we advance a new mechanism, through which Kondo-based semimetals develop
out of conduction electrons with a low carrier-density in the presence of an
even number of rare-earth sites. We demonstrate this effect by studying the
Kondo material Yb3Ir4Ge13 along with its closed-f-shell counterpart,

below its Kondo temperature originates from the Kondo effect of a low carrier
conduction-electron background. In addition, it displays fragile magnetism at
very low temperatures, which, in turn, can be tuned to a non Fermi liquid
regime through Lu-for-Yb substitution. These findings are connected with recent
theoretical studies in simplified models. Our results open an entirely new

changes throughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to
differ significantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result
in beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative
solution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT

et al., we find that the total and polarized intensity of the disk exhibits
strong azimuthal asymmetries at projected distances consistent with the
previously reported bright and dark ring-shaped structures (~45-99 au). The
sinusoidal-like variations possess a maximum brightness at position angles near
~268-300 degrees and are up to ~28% stronger in total intensity. Furthermore,
significant radial and azimuthal variations are also detected in the
polarization fraction of the disk. In particular, we find that regions of lower
polarization fraction are associated with annuli of increased surface
brightness, suggesting that the relative proportion of multiple-to-single
scattering is greater along the ring and gap structures. Moreover, we find
strong (~20%) azimuthal variation in the polarization fraction along the
shadowed region of the disk. Further investigation reveals that the azimuthal
variation is not the result of disk flaring effects, but instead from a
decrease in the relative contribution of multiple-to-single scattering within
the shadowed region. Employing a two-layer scattering surface, we hypothesize
that the diminished contribution in multiple scattering may result from
shadowing by an inclined inner disk, which prevents direct stellar light from
reaching the optically thick underlying surface component.

drives a long period harmonic pendulum oscillation of $(n+1)\theta_{s}$ of the

flux from the loop to strengthen or weaken the synaptic weight. Designs are
presented for circuits with hundreds of intermediate synaptic weights between
minimum and maximum strengths. Circuits for implementing unsupervised learning
are modeled using two photons to strengthen and two photons to weaken the
synaptic weight via Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules, and techniques are
proposed to control the learning rate. Implementation of short-term plasticity,
homeostatic plasticity, and metaplasticity in loop neurons is discussed.

wave velocities at two critical prestrain values, which define transitions
between the three distinct phases of these structural assemblies. At low cable
prestrains, the wave speeds are zero as the lattices have zero effective
stiffness. At moderate prestrains, the wave speed is nonzero and finally, at
prestrain levels where the bars buckle, the wave speed decreases to a lower

properties such as very low wave velocities compared to their constituent

find that shear waves travel faster than longitudinal waves in tensegrity

because of its low storage cost and high query speed. Recent cross-modal
hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the
multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable. However, such unified or
equal-length hash representations could inherently sacrifice their
representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not
have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by
different hash codes of unequal lengths. To mitigate these problems, this paper
exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem: encode the heterogeneous
data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in
various challenging scenarios. To this end, a generalized and flexible
cross-modal hashing framework, termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH),
is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired
multi-modal data, and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios. More
specifically, MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn
the modality-specific hash codes with different length settings, while
synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices to semantically
correlate the different hash representations for heterogeneous data comparable.
As a result, the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for
various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments
evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under
various retrieval scenarios and show its competitive performance with the
state-of-the-arts.

  Parallelism",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper summarizes the idea of Subarray-Level Parallelism (SALP) in DRAM,
which was published in ISCA 2012, and examines the work's significance and
future potential. Modern DRAMs have multiple banks to serve multiple memory
requests in parallel. However, when two requests go to the same bank, they have
to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of on-chip memory. Adding
more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. Our
goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks
with a low-cost approach. To this end, we propose three new mechanisms, SALP-1,
SALP-2, and MASA (Multitude of Activated Subarrays), to reduce the
serialization of different requests that go to the same bank. The key
observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern DRAM bank is
implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently
while sharing few global peripheral structures.
  Our three proposed mechanisms mitigate the negative impact of bank
serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies
of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank.
SALP-1 requires no changes to the existing DRAM structure, and needs to only
reinterpret some of the existing DRAM timing parameters. SALP-2 and MASA
require only modest changes (< 0.15% area overhead) to the DRAM peripheral
structures, which are much less design constrained than the DRAM core. Our
evaluations show that SALP-1, SALP-2 and MASA significantly improve performance
for both single-core systems (7%/13%/17%) and multi-core systems (15%/16%/20%),
averaged across a wide range of workloads. We also demonstrate that our
mechanisms can be combined with application-aware memory request scheduling in
multicore systems to further improve performance and fairness.

the dark matter and baryonic components of the cluster using NFW and GNFW
profiles respectively. The observational models (OM I and OM II) model only the
gas content of the cluster. The two OMs vary only in the priors they use in
Bayesian inference: OM I has a joint prior on angular radius $\theta$ and
integrated Comptonisation $Y$, derived from simulations, while OM II uses
separable priors on $\theta$ and $Y$ which are based on calculations of the
physical model. For the comparison we consider a sample of $54$ clusters which
are a subsample of the second Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources.
We first compare the $Y$ estimates of the three models, and find that the PM
generally yields lower estimates relative to the OMs. We then compute the Earth
Mover's Distance between the $\theta$ - $Y$ posterior distributions obtained
from each model for each cluster, and find that the two models which are most
discrepant are PM and OM I. Finally, we compare the Bayesian evidence values
obtained from each model for each cluster. OM I generally provides the best fit
to the data but not at a statistically significant level, according to the
Jeffreys scale. The highest evidence ratio obtained is actually in favour of
the PM over OM I.

PredicTor, a path selection technique that uses a Random Forest classifier

using those relays. We implemented PredicTor in the Tor source code and show
through live Tor experiments and Shadow simulations that PredicTor improves Tor
network performance by 11% to 23% compared to Vanilla Tor and by 7% to 13%

PredicTor is the first path selection algorithm to dynamically avoid highly
congested nodes during times of high congestion and avoid long-distance paths
during times of low congestion. We evaluate the anonymity of PredicTor using
standard entropy-based and time-to-first-compromise metrics, but these cannot
capture the possibility of leakage due to the use of location in path
selection. To better address this, we propose a new anonymity metric called
CLASI: Client Autonomous System Inference. CLASI is the first anonymity metric
in Tor that measures an adversary's ability to infer client Autonomous Systems
(ASes) by fingerprinting circuits at the network, country, and relay level. We
find that CLASI shows anonymity loss for location-aware path selection
algorithms, where entropy-based metrics show little to no loss of anonymity.
Additionally, CLASI indicates that PredicTor has similar sender AS leakage

circuits that are independent of client location.

scatterer embedded in a random noisy background medium, given measurements of
the scattered field and information about the background medium and the sound
profile. We present six different methods for the solution of this inverse
problem using different amounts of scattered data and prior information about
the random background medium and the scatterer. The different inversion
algorithms are defined by a combination of stochastic programming methods and
Bayesian formulation. Our basic results show that if we have data for just one
instance of the random background medium the best strategy is to invert for
both random medium and unknown scatterer with appropriate regularization.
However, if we have data for multiple instances of the medium it may be worth
solving a coupled set of multiple inverse problems. We present several
numerical results for inverting for various scatterer geometries under
different inversion scenarios. The main take-away of our study is that one
should invert for both unknown scatterer and random medium, with appropriate,
prior-information based regularization. Furthermore, if data from multiple
realizations of the background medium is available, then it may be beneficial
to combine results from multiple inversions.

accounting for almost all nucleons with momentum greater than the Fermi
momentum (kF). A fundamental characteristic of SRC pairs is having large
relative momenta as compared to kF, and smaller center-of-mass (c.m.) which
indicates a small separation distance between the nucleons in the pair.
Determining the c.m. momentum distribution of SRC pairs is essential for
understanding their formation process. We report here on the extraction of the
c.m. motion of proton-proton (pp) SRC pairs in Carbon and, for the first time
in heavier and ansymetric nuclei: aluminum, iron, and lead, from measurements
of the A(e,e'pp) reaction. We find that the pair c.m. motion for these nuclei
can be described by a three-dimensional Gaussian with a narrow width ranging
from 140 to 170 MeV/c, approximately consistent with the sum of two mean-field
nucleon momenta. Comparison with calculations appears to show that the SRC
pairs are formed from mean-field nucleons in specific quantum states.

for the case in which system noise is present. The EKFDMD with trPOD can be
successfully applied to many-DoF problems, including a fluid-problem example,

Drives (HDDs) as a backend storage - low cost and large capacity - is no longer
unique, and eventually they will be replaced by low-end SSDs which have large
capacity but perform orders of magnitude better than HDDs. Thus, it is widely
believed that all-flash multi-tier storage systems will be adopted in the
enterprise datacenters in the near future. However, existing caching or tiering
solutions for SSD-HDD hybrid storage systems are not suitable for all-flash
storage systems. This is because that all-flash storage systems do not have a
large speed difference (e.g., 10x) among each tier. Instead, different
specialties (such as high performance, high capacity, etc.) of each tier should
be taken into consideration. Motivated by this, we develop an automatic data
placement manager called ""AutoTiering"" to handle virtual machine disk files
(VMDK) allocation and migration in an all-flash multi-tier datacenter to best
utilize the storage resource, optimize the performance, and reduce the
migration overhead. AutoTiering is based on an optimization framework, whose
core technique is to predict VM's performance change on different tiers with
different specialties without conducting real migration. As far as we know,
AutoTiering is the first optimization solution designed for all-flash

estimate is calculated directly from the angular radius $\theta$ - integrated
Comptonisation parameter $Y$ posterior distributions, and the other uses a
`slicing function' to provide information on $\theta$ based on X-ray
measurements and previous Planck mission samples. We find that for $37$ of the
clusters, the AMI mass estimates are lower than both values obtained from

By transport measurement on heterostructures composed of p-type topological
crystalline insulator SnTe and n-type conventional semiconductor PbTe, here we

algorithms where partial gradients are computed distributedly and then averaged
in the final stage). In particular, compressed CDC first compresses/combines
several intermediate results for a single computation, and then utilizes
multiple such combined packets to create a coded multicast packet that is
simultaneously useful for multiple computations. We characterize the achievable
communication load of compressed CDC and show that it substantially outperforms

repeated for only particular network topologies and have bounded multiplicity.
Characterizations of both types of modes are obtained, in part by drawing on

that network-invariant modes necessarily prevent controllability unless a
sufficient fraction of the subsystems are actuated, both in the network as a
whole and in any weakly-connected partition. In contrast, the multiplicities of

(TAEs) of the W4-17 computational thermochemistry benchmark have been
determined at the CCSD(T) level near the basis set limit using several families
of core correlation basis sets, such as aug-cc-pCVnZ (n=3-6), aug-cc-pwCVnZ
(n=3-5), and nZaPa-CV (n=3-5). The three families of basis sets agree very well
with each other (0.01 kcal/mol RMS) when extrapolating from the two largest
available basis sets: however, there are considerable differences in
convergence behavior for the smaller basis sets. nZaPa-CV is superior for the
core-core term and awCVnZ for the core-valence term. While the
aug-cc-pwCV(T+d)Z basis set of Yockel and Wilson is superior to aug-cc-pwCVTZ,
further extension of this family proved unproductive. The best compromise
between accuracy and computational cost, in the context of high-accuracy
computational thermochemistry methods such as W4 theory, is CCSD(T)/awCV{T,Q}Z,
where the {T,Q} notation stands for extrapolation from the awCVTZ and awCVQZ
basis set pair. For lower-cost calculations, a previously proposed combination
of CCSD-F12b/cc-pCVTZ-F12 and CCSD(T)/pwCVTZ(no f) appears to 'give the best
bang for the buck'. While core-valence correlation accounts for the lion's
share of the inner shell contribution in first-row molecules, for second-row
molecules core-core contributions may become important, particularly in systems
like P4 and S4 with multiple adjacent second-row atoms. The average absolute
core-core/core-valence ratio is 0.08 for the first-row species in W4-17, but
0.47 for the second-row subset.

is invariant under a discrete $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetry generated by $S_{1,2}$,
(b) CP symmetry $X$ transform $M_\nu$ as $X^T M_\nu X=M_\nu^*$, and (c) $X$ and
$S_{1,2}$ obey consistency conditions $X S_{1,2}^* X^\dagger=S_{2,1}$, then two
of the neutrino masses are degenerate independent of specific forms of $X$,
$S_1$ and $S_2$. Explicit examples of this result are discussed in the context
of $\Delta(6 n^2)$ groups which can also be used to constrain neutrino mixing
matrix $U$. Degeneracy in two of the masses does not allow complete
determination of $U$ but it can also be fixed once the perturbations are
introduced. We consider explicit perturbations which break $Z_2\times Z_2$
symmetries but respect CP. These are shown to remove the degeneracy and provide
a predictive description of neutrino spectrum. In particular, a correlation
$\sin 2\theta_{23}\sin\delta_{CP}=\pm {\rm Im}[p]$ is obtained between the
atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ and the CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$

position angles from our observations are in excellent agreement with those

spatial scale we are probing ($\sim$50-1000 au), the physical mechanisms for
polarizing the continuum emission do not vary significantly over the wavelength
range of $\sim$0.88-7.5 mm. We hypothesize that the observed polarization
position angles trace the magnetic field which converges from large scale to an
approximately face-on rotating accretion flow. In this scenario, magnetic field
is predominantly poloidal on $>$100 au scales, and becomes toroidal on smaller
scales. However, this interpretation remains uncertain due to the high dust
optical depths at the central region of IRAS\,16293-2422\,B and the uncertain
temperature profile. We suggest that dust polarization at wavelengths

Future sensitive observations of dust polarization in the fully optically thin

$\Delta\theta$ of voltage angles and a wide range of frequency deviations in a

Previously, we had discussed semi-qualitatively the phonon-kink scattering

that exponent of the power low in the temperature dependence of the phonon
thermal conductivity depends, due to kinks, on the distribution of the random
elastic stresses in the crystal, that pin the kinks motion along the
dislocation lines. We found that one of the random matrix distributions of the
well known Wigner-Dyson theory is most suitable to fit the lead samples

low temperature dependences of the phonon thermal conductivity, in principle,
may possess exponents in the range of $2\div 5$.

effect is important for applications in high-energy physics. Radiative
spin-polarization is a manifestation of quantum radiation reaction affecting
the spin-dynamics of electrons. We recently proposed that an analogue of the
Sokolov-Ternov effect could occur in the strong electromagnetic fields of
ultra-high-intensity lasers, which would result in a build-up of
spin-polarization in femtoseconds. In this paper we develop a density matrix
formalism for describing beam polarization in strong electromagnetic fields. We
start by using the density matrix formalism to study spin-flips in non-linear
Compton scattering and its dependence on the initial polarization state of the
electrons. Numerical calculations show a radial polarization of the scattered
electron beam in a circularly polarized laser, and we find azimuthal
asymmetries in the polarization patterns for ultra-short laser pulses. A degree
of polarization approaching 9 % is achieved after emitting just a single
photon. We develop the theory by deriving a local constant crossed field
approximation (LCFA) for the polarization density matrix, which is a
generalization of the well known LCFA scattering rates. We find spin-dependent
expressions that may be included in electromagnetic charged-particle simulation
codes, such as particle-in-cell plasma simulation codes, using Monte-Carlo
modules. In particular, these expressions include the spin-flip rates for
arbitrary initial polarization of the electrons. The validity of the LCFA is
confirmed by explicit comparison with an exact QED calculation of electron
polarization in an ultrashort laser pulse.

know what instruments are played, when they are played, and where the playing
actions occur in the scene. While audio-based recognition of instruments has
been widely studied, the visual aspect of the music instrument playing remains
largely unaddressed in the literature. One of the main obstacles is the
difficulty in collecting annotated data of the action locations for
training-based methods. To address this issue, we propose a weakly-supervised
framework to find when and where the instruments are played in the videos. We
propose to use two auxiliary models, a sound model and an object model, to
provide supervisions for training the instrument-playing action model. The
sound model provides temporal supervisions, while the object model provides
spatial supervisions. They together can simultaneously provide temporal and
spatial supervisions. The resulted model only needs to analyze the visual part
of a music video to deduce which, when and where instruments are played. We
found that the proposed method significantly improves the localization

contemporaneous with Gaia light curves, a sample of Gaia LPV candidates with
good parallaxes, the ASAS_SN catalogue of LPVs, and the OGLE catalogues of LPVs

the most famous one which is a direct extension of Tukey HD to regression.

functions, including the Hamming and the rank metric distances. Applications of

$\mathbb{F}_q$-linear MRD codes are not dense in the family of codes of the
same dimension. More precisely, we show that the density of

all matrix codes of the same dimension is asymptotically at most $1/2$, both as
$q \to +\infty$ and as $m \to +\infty$. We also prove that MDS and

covering radius of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear rank metric codes, we show that a

energy spectrum directly, we find that in two dimension an applied magnetic
field can shift or even destroy the quasibound states around the Dirac point
and their discrete scaling symmetry disappears. However, as the magnetic field
increases, the remaining quasibound states are pushed up to the Dirac point.
When one quasibound state is close to the Dirac point, the spectrum is modified
significantly, due to the resonant scattering. The magnetic oscillation of the
spectrum displays the same discrete scaling symmetry as the quasibound state
does in zero magnetic field. This phenomenon also occurs in the quantum limit
of three-dimensional Dirac semimetals, where the system becomes quasi

about the spin of the individual bodies. However, with present detectors only
the mass-weighted combination of the components of the spin along the orbital
angular momentum can be measured accurately. This quantity, the effective spin
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian
order. The measured distribution of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values from a
population of detected binaries, and in particular whether this distribution is
symmetric about zero, encodes valuable information about the underlying
compact-binary formation channels. In this paper we focus on two important
complications of using the effective spin to study astrophysical population
properties: (i) an astrophysical distribution for $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values
which is symmetric does not necessarily lead to a symmetric distribution for
the detected effective spin values, leading to a \emph{selection bias}; and
(ii) the posterior distribution of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for individual events
is \emph{asymmetric} and it cannot usually be treated as a Gaussian. We find
that the posterior distributions for $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ systematically show
fatter tails toward larger positive values, unless the total mass is large or
the mass ratio $m_2/m_1$ is smaller than $\sim 1/2$. Finally we show that
uncertainties in the measurement of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ are systematically
larger when the true value is negative than when it is positive. All these
factors can bias astrophysical inference about the population when we have more
than $\sim 100$ events and should be taken into account when using
gravitational-wave measurements to characterize astrophysical populations.

published in HPCA 2015, and examines the work's significance and future
potential. AL-DRAM is a mechanism that optimizes DRAM latency based on the DRAM
module and the operating temperature, by exploiting the extra margin that is
built into the DRAM timing parameters. DRAM manufacturers provide a large
margin for the timing parameters as a provision against two worst-case
scenarios. First, due to process variation, some outlier DRAM chips are much
slower than others. Second, chips become slower at higher temperatures. The
timing parameter margin ensures that the slow outlier chips operate reliably at
the worst-case temperature, and hence leads to a high access latency.
  Using an FPGA-based DRAM testing platform, our work first characterizes the
extra margin for 115 DRAM modules from three major manufacturers. The
experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce four of the most
critical timing parameters by a minimum/maximum of 17.3%/54.8% at 55C while
maintaining reliable operation. AL-DRAM uses these observations to adaptively
select reliable DRAM timing parameters for each DRAM module based on the
module's current operating conditions. AL-DRAM does not require any changes to
the DRAM chip or its interface; it only requires multiple different timing
parameters to be specified and supported by the memory controller. Our real
system evaluations show that AL-DRAM improves the performance of
memory-intensive workloads by an average of 14% without introducing any errors.
Our characterization and proposed techniques have inspired several other works
on analyzing and/or exploiting different sources of latency and performance
variation within DRAM chips.

published in HPCA 2013, and examines the work's significance and future
potential. The capacity and cost-per-bit of DRAM have historically scaled to
satisfy the needs of increasingly large and complex computer systems. However,
DRAM latency has remained almost constant, making memory latency the
performance bottleneck in today's systems. We observe that the high access
latency is not intrinsic to DRAM, but a trade-off is made to decrease the cost
per bit. To mitigate the high area overhead of DRAM sensing structures,
commodity DRAMs connect many DRAM cells to each sense amplifier through a wire
called a bitline. These bit-lines have a high parasitic capacitance due to
their long length, and this bitline capacitance is the dominant source of DRAM
latency. Specialized low-latency DRAMs use shorter bitlines with fewer cells,
but have a higher cost-per-bit due to greater sense amplifier area overhead. To
achieve both low latency and low cost per bit, we introduce Tiered-Latency DRAM
(TL-DRAM). In TL-DRAM, each long bitline is split into two shorter segments by
an isolation transistor, allowing one of the two segments to be accessed with
the latency of a short-bitline DRAM without incurring a high cost per bit. We
propose mechanisms that use the low-latency segment as a hardware-managed or
software-managed cache. Our evaluations show that our proposed mechanisms
improve both performance and energy efficiency for both single-core and
multiprogrammed workloads. Tiered-Latency DRAM has inspired several other works
on reducing DRAM latency with little to no architectural modification.

sources have been used at Fermilab since the 1970s. At the offline test stand,
new R&D is carried out to develop and upgrade the present magnetron-type
sources of $H^{-}$ ions of up to 80 mA and 35 keV beam energy in the context of
the Proton Improvement Plan. The aim of this plan is to provide high-power
proton beams for the experiments at FNAL. In order to reduce the amount of
tuning and monitoring of these ion sources, a new electronic system consisting
of a current-regulated arc discharge modulator allow the ion source to run at a
constant arc current for improved beam output and operation. A solenoid-type
gas valve feeds $H_{2}$ gas into the source precisely and independently of
ambient temperature. This summary will cover several studies and design changes
that have been tested and will eventually be implemented on the operational
magnetron sources at Fermilab. Innovative results for this type of ion source
include cathode geometries, solenoid gas valves, current controlled arc pulser,
cesium boiler redesign, gas mixtures of hydrogen and nitrogen, and duty factor
reduction, with the aim to improve source lifetime, stability, and reducing the
amount of tuning needed. In this summary, I will highlight the advances made in

solution(s) of a non-linear, second order, ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with piecewise polynomial functions by using the collocation method. It then
focuses on the application of the method to generate collocation approximations
for the Van der Pol equation with initial conditions and with varying equation
parameter, {\mu}. It is shown that the collocation method in its original form
is impractical for generating these approximations due to the numerical costs
of producing such an approximation, particularly as the stiffness of the
equation increases with parameter, {\mu}. An adaptation to the method, termed
segmented collocation, is proposed, reliant upon on the specific structure and
convergence for initial value problems, and shown theoretically and numerically
to be capable of generating equivalent approximations for much superior costs.
Further study is proposed; to compare the segmented method to other numerical
methods traditionally employed with equations of this type such as the
Runge-Kutta family; and to develop and test the method in order to ascertain
its complete usefulness and competitive standing in the context of
approximating second order, ODEs with initial conditions.

Assuming that the common horizon radius of these black holes is fixed by the
minimum distance that is derived from the Riemann invariant computed from loop
quantum gravity, the masses of these non-singular stable black holes are of the
order of the Planck mass. However, if they are formed just after inflation,
during reheating, their initial masses are about six orders of magnitude
higher. After a short period of growth by the accretion of relativistic matter,
they evaporate until reaching the extreme solution. Only a fraction of $3.8

primordial black holes (PBHs) in order to explain the present abundance of dark

simulations for a convection-dominated 9 Msun and a 20 Msun progenitor that

We compare in detail the Aenus-Alcar code, which uses fully multidimensional
two-moment neutrino transport with an M1 closure, with a ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+)
version of this code and with the Prometheus-Vertex code that employs RbR+
two-moment transport with a Boltzmann closure. Besides testing consequences of
ignored non-radial neutrino-flux components in the RbR+ approximation, we also
discuss the influence of various transport ingredients applied or not applied
in recent literature, namely simplified neutrino-pair processes,
neutrino-electron scattering, velocity-dependent and gravitational-redshift
terms, and strangeness and many-body corrections for neutrino-nucleon
scattering. Alcar and Vertex show excellent agreement in 1D and 2D despite a
slightly but systematically smaller radius (~1km) and stronger convection of
the proto-neutron star with Alcar. As found previously, the RbR+ approximation
is conducive to explosions, but much less severely in the convection-dominated
9 Msun case than in the marginally exploding 20 Msun model, where the onset
time of explosion also exhibits big stochastic variations, and the RbR+
approximation has no distinctly stronger supportive effect than simplified pair
processes or strangeness and many-body corrections. Neglecting
neutrino-electron scattering has clearly unfavorable effects for explosions,
while ignoring velocity and gravitational-redshift effects can both promote or
delay the explosion. The ratio of advection timescale to neutrino-heating
timescale in 1D simulations is a sensitive indicator of the influence of
physics ingredients on explosions also in multidimensional simulations.

play an important role in neutrino-driven supernova explosions. In our previous
work, we studied the interaction of vorticity and entropy waves with the
supernova shock using a linear perturbations theory. In this paper, we extend
our work by studying the effect of acoustic waves. As the acoustic waves cross
the shock, the perturbed shock induces a field of entropy and vorticity waves
in the post-shock flow. We find that, even when the upstream flow is assumed to
be dominated by sonic perturbations, the shock-generated vorticity waves
contain most of the turbulent kinetic energy in the post-shock region, while
the entropy waves produced behind the shock are responsible for most of the
density perturbations. The entropy perturbations are expected to become buoyant
as a response to the gravity force and then generate additional turbulence in
the post-shock region. This leads to a modest reduction of the critical
neutrino luminosity necessary for producing an explosion, which we estimate to
be less than $ \sim 5 \% $.

  human capital in moroccan hotels",,,,,"cs.CY q-fin.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The growth of the modern knowledge-based economy is becoming less and less
dependent on tangible assets and more on intangible ones. In this context, the
role of human capital in the value creation process has become central. Despite
the large amount of scientific work on human capital phenomena, little research
has revealed the role of human capital in the process of creating value. The
purpose of this article is to evaluate the impact of human capital on value
creation within 31 classified hotels in Morocco for the period 2013-2015. This
paper is organized into four sections. First, we return to the main
conceptualization of value creation. The goal of this first section is to
synthesize prior work on this construct and highlight the main role of the
resource based view (RBV) in explaining it. This view presents the point that
links value creation to human capital given that this latter concept is one of
the most resources of the firm. Next, we present the main definition of human
capital. To do so, we make use of concepts from psychology, economy and
strategic human resource management. Then, we shed light on the existing
relationship between the two concepts of our research. Finally, we present the
methodology of this research as well as the results. The required data to
calculate value creation is obtained mainly from the annual reports of Moroccan
hotels. Whereas, human capital is assessed by a questionnaire using the scale
of Subramaniam and Youndt (2005). Data is examined using linear regression by
PASW statistics software. The results of this study give a more concrete
picture on the creation of value in this context and refute any link between
these two concepts.

Moreover, we showed how to modify techniques for detecting coordination
mismatches such as the compatibility check for star topologies and the
interoperability check for cycle topologies, in such a way that those two
checks are applicable also in the presence of nonsynchronous communications. In
this addendum, we generalize those results by showing that it is possible to
verify in a component-oriented way an arbitrary property of a certain class
(not only deadlock) over an entire architectural type having an arbitrary
topology (not only stars and cycles) by considering also behavioral variations,
exogenous variations, endogenous variations, and multiplicity variations, so to
deal with the possible presence of nonsynchronous communications. The proofs
