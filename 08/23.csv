to directly manipulate high-level attributes of a natural scene. The key to our
approach is a deep generative network which can hallucinate images of a scene
as if they were taken at a different season (e.g. during winter), weather
condition (e.g. in a cloudy day) or time of the day (e.g. at sunset). Once the
scene is hallucinated with the given attributes, the corresponding look is then
transferred to the input image while preserving the semantic details intact,
giving a photo-realistic manipulation result. As the proposed framework
hallucinates what the scene will look like, it does not require any reference
style image as commonly utilized in most of the appearance or style transfer
approaches. Moreover, it allows to simultaneously manipulate a given scene
according to a diverse set of transient attributes within a single model,
eliminating the need of training multiple networks per each translation task.
Our comprehensive set of qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach against the competing methods.

short-time Fourier transform measurements arises in several important phase
retrieval applications, including ptychography and ultra-short pulse
characterization. In this paper, we prove that in order to determine a pair of
generic signals uniquely, up to trivial ambiguities, the number of phaseless
measurements one needs to collect is, at most, five times the number of
parameters required to describe the signals. This result improves significantly
upon previous papers, which required the number of measurements to be quadratic
in the number of parameters rather than linear.
  In addition, we consider the simpler problem of recovering a pair of generic
signals from their blind short-time Fourier transform, when the phases are
known. In this setting, which can be understood as a special case of the blind
deconvolution problem, we show that the number of measurements required to
determine the two signals, up to trivial ambiguities, equals exactly the number
of parameters to be recovered.
  As a side result, we study the classical phase retrieval problem---that is,
recovering a signal from its Fourier magnitudes---when some entries of the
signal are known apriori. We derive a bound on the number of required
measurements as a function of the size of the set of known entries.
Specifically, we show that if most of the signal's entries are known, then only
a few Fourier magnitudes are necessary to determine a signal uniquely.

smaller radii in high flux states; model-independent tests indicate that this

variations in line flux suggest that the narrow Fe K-alpha line may originate
at radii as small as R ~ 50-130 GM/c^2 in high flux states. These results
indicate that the narrow Fe K-alpha line in NGC 4151 is primarily excited in

different geometrical layouts at the exit towards the pedestrian flow via
controlled laboratory experiments with human participants. The experimental
setups involve pedestrian flow through 14 different geometrical configurations
that include different exit locations and obstacles near exit under normal and
slow running conditions. It was found that corner exit performed better than
middle exit under same obstacle condition. Further, it was observed that the
effectiveness of obstacle is sensitive to its size and distance from the exit.
Thus, with careful architectural adjustment within a standard escape area, a
substantial increase in outflow under normal and slow running conditions could
be achieved. However, it was also observed that placing the obstacle too close
to the exit can reduce outflow under both normal and slow running conditions.
Moreover, we could not observe ""faster-is-slower"" effect under slow running
condition and instead noticed ""faster-is-faster"" effect. In addition, the power
law fitted headway distribution demonstrated that any architectural
configurations that enhanced the outflow have higher exponent value compared to
the other configuration that negates the outflow.

generate accurate solutions. To this end, we propose a deep learning approach
based on a 3D encoder-decoder Convolutional Neural Network architecture for
accelerating 3D topology optimization and to determine the optimal
computational strategy for its deployment. Analysis of iteration-wise progress
of the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization process is used as a
guideline to study how the earlier steps of the conventional topology
optimization can be used as input for our approach to predict the final
optimized output structure directly from this input. We conduct a comparative
study between multiple strategies for training the neural network and assess
the effect of using various input combinations for the CNN to finalize the
strategy with the highest accuracy in predictions for practical deployment. For
the best performing network, we achieved about 40% reduction in overall
computation time while also attaining structural accuracies in the order of

whether the value of the coupling constant is less than 1 or larger than 1. At
critical coupling it was previously observed that a strongly localised magnetic
impurity behaves very similarly to a vortex. This remains true for axially
symmetric configurations away from critical coupling. In particular, a delta
function impurity of a suitable strength is related to a vortex configuration
without impurity by singular gauge transformation. However, the interaction of
vortices and impurities is more subtle and depends not only on the coupling
constant and the impurity strength, but also on how broad the impurity is.
Furthermore, the interaction typically depends on the distance and may be
attractive at short distances and repulsive at long distances. Numerical
simulations confirm moduli space approximation results for the scattering of
one and two vortices with an impurity. However, a double vortex will split up
when scattering with an impurity, and the direction of the split depends on the
sign of the impurity. Head-on collisions of a single vortex with different
impurities away from critical coupling is also briefly discussed.

being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early
2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design,
and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarization
anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands: 27, 39,
93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three
small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes (SATs) and one large-aperture 6-m telescope
(LAT), with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are
to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of
relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a
cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and
constrain the duration of reionization. The SATs will target the largest
angular scales observable from Chile, mapping ~10% of the sky to a white noise
level of 2 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the
primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, at a target level of $\sigma(r)=0.003$.
The LAT will map ~40% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected
white noise level of 6 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands,
overlapping with the majority of the LSST sky region and partially with DESI.
With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the
Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological
parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the
microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle
polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also
provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000
extragalactic sources.

aspects of this body, its atmosphere, and its giant impact binary-planet
formation; as well as (ii) the scientific desire to initiate the reconnaissance
of the newly-discovered population of dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt. That
exploration took place in the form of a single spacecraft flyby that yielded an
impressive array of exciting results that have transformed our understanding of
this world and its satellites, and which opened our eyes to the exciting nature
of the dwarf planet population of the Kuiper Belt. From Pluto's five-object
satellite system, to its hydrocarbon haze-laden atmosphere, to its variegated
distribution of surface volatiles, to its wide array of geologic expressions
that include extensive glaciation and suspected cryovolcanoes, plus the
tantalizing possibility of an interior ocean, the Pluto system has proven to be
as complex as larger terrestrial bodies like Mars, and it begs for future
exploration. Owing to Pluto's high obliquity (and consequently, current-epoch
southern hemisphere polar winter darkness) and the single spacecraft nature of
the New Horizons flyby, only about 40% of Pluto and its binary satellite,
Charon, could be mapped at high pixel scales (better than 10 km/pix).
Additionally, due to their distances from New Horizons at closest approach,
none of Pluto's small moons could be studied at high resolution during the
flyby. Furthermore, studies of the time variability of atmospheric, geologic,
and surface-atmosphere interactions cannot be practically made by additional
flybys, and they cannot be made from Earth-based observations. We find that
these limitations, combined with Pluto's many important, open scientific
questions, strongly motivate a Pluto System follow on orbiter mission.

to study brain-phenotype associations that inform our understanding of disease.
Recent studies have shown that Gaussian random field (GRF) based tools can have
inflated family-wise error rates (FWERs). This has led to fervent discussion as
to which preprocessing steps are necessary to control the FWER using GRF-based
SEI. The failure of GRF-based methods is due to unrealistic assumptions about
the covariance function of the imaging data. The permutation procedure is the
most robust SEI tool because it estimates the covariance function from the
imaging data. However, the permutation procedure can fail because its
assumption of exchangeability is violated in many imaging modalities. Here, we
propose the (semi-) parametric bootstrap joint (PBJ; sPBJ) testing procedures
that are designed for SEI of multilevel imaging data. The sPBJ procedure uses a
robust estimate of the covariance function, which yields consistent estimates
of standard errors, even if the covariance model is misspecified. We use our
methods to study the association between performance and executive functioning
in a working fMRI study. The sPBJ procedure is robust to variance
misspecification and maintains nominal FWER in small samples, in contrast to
the GRF methods. The sPBJ also has equal or superior power to the PBJ and
permutation procedures. We provide an R package

only slightly above or within the bandwidth, a substantial enhancement of
correlations can be achieved before the system reaches a high electronic
temperature. This behavior relies on the non-thermal nature of the driven

scenario, in which the regions of different scales often exhibit high visual
similarity. This feature is universal both within an image and across different
images, indicating the importance of scale invariance of a crowd counting
model. Motivated by this, in this paper we propose simple but effective
variants of pooling module, i.e., multi-kernel pooling and stacked pooling, to
boost the scale invariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), benefiting
much the crowd density estimation and counting. Specifically, the multi-kernel
pooling comprises of pooling kernels with multiple receptive fields to capture
the responses at multi-scale local ranges. The stacked pooling is an equivalent
form of multi-kernel pooling, while, it reduces considerable computing cost.
Our proposed pooling modules do not introduce extra parameters into model and
can easily take place of the vanilla pooling layer in implementation. In
empirical study on two benchmark crowd counting datasets, the stacked pooling
beats the vanilla pooling layer in most cases.

detector energy scale at energies of 5-100 MeV and to estimate the non-linear
effect they produce in large liquid scintillator and Cherenkov detectors. For
this purpose the generalized energy scale detector model was constructed and
the detector response was simulated by means of toy Monte Carlo simulations. It
was found that the non-linearity grows proportionally to a relative fraction of
the Cherenkov light into the total light yield achieving the maximum for pure
water Cherenkov detectors. The effect generally increases with energy and then
saturates at higher energies. In the energy region 5-10 MeV for all types of
detectors and for energies 5-100 MeV in scintillation detectors with low
fractions of Cherenkov light ( < 10 % ) the non-linearity is estimated to be a
sub- percent effect. Meanwhile it could reach the order of 5% for 50 - 100 MeV
electrons in pure water Cherenkov detectors. It was hypothesised that this
effect can contribute to the difference in observed reactor neutrino spectra.
The present analysis showed that the effect was quite small to generate
significant differences in observed reactor neutrino spectra. Though it still
may be relevant for precision measurements and phenomenological analysis in
aforementioned energy ranges.

statistics contain information absent when using just tracer 2-point
statistics. Massive neutrinos uniquely affect cosmic voids. We explore their
impact on void clustering using both the DEMNUni and MassiveNuS simulations.
For voids, neutrino effects depend on the observed void tracers. As the
neutrino mass increases, the number of small voids traced by cold dark matter
particles increases and the number of large voids decreases. Surprisingly, when
massive, highly biased, halos are used as tracers, we find the opposite effect.
The scale at which voids cluster, as well as the void correlation, is similarly
sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses and the tracers. This scale dependent
trend is not due to simulation volume or halo density. The interplay of these
signatures in the void abundance and clustering leaves a distinct fingerprint
that could be detected with observations and potentially help break
degeneracies between different cosmological parameters. This paper paves the
way to exploit cosmic voids in future surveys to constrain the mass of

include phase transitions in quantum magnetism as well as those between
Symmetry Protected Topological phases. In this paper, we present several
examples of Deconfined Quantum Critical Points (DQCP) between Symmetry
Protected Topological phases in 3+1-D for both bosonic and fermionic systems.
Some of the critical theories can be formulated as non-abelian gauge theories
either in their Infra-Red free regime, or in the conformal window when they
flow to the Banks-Zaks fixed points. We explicitly demonstrate several
interesting quantum critical phenomena. We describe situations in which the
same phase transition allows for multiple universality classes controlled by
distinct fixed points. We exhibit the possibility - which we dub ""unnecessary

within the same phase. We present examples of interaction driven band-theory-
forbidden continuous phase transitions between two distinct band insulators.

on the development of the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, which leveraged
the vast increase in computing power to dramatically improve predictive
accuracy. Even with the anticipated increase in supercomputing capabilities,
the use of LES in design is limited by its high computational cost. Moreover,
to aid decision making, such LES computations have to be augmented to estimate
underlying uncertainties in simulation components. At the same time, other
changes are happening across industries that build or use combustion devices.
While efficiency and emissions reduction are still the primary design
objectives, reducing cost of operation by optimizing maintenance and repair is
becoming an important segment of the enterprise. This latter quest is aided by
the digitization of combustors, which allows collection and storage of
operational data from a host of sensors over a fleet of devices. Moreover,
several levels of computing including low-power hardware present on board the

of exercising exacting control of their quantum mechanical degrees of freedom
limit the pace of rational progress in advancing the properties of these and
other materials. With extraordinary effort to counteract natural processes of
dissipation, precisely engineered ultracold quantum simulators could point the
way to exotic new materials. Here, we look instead to the quantum mechanical
character of the arrested state formed by a quenched ultracold molecular
plasma. This novel class of system arises spontaneously, without a deliberate
engineering of interactions, and evolves naturally from state-specified initial
conditions, to a long-lived final state of canonical density, in a process that
conflicts with classical notions of plasma dissipation and neutral
dissociation. We take information from experimental observations to develop a
conceptual argument that attempts to explain this state of arrested relaxation
in terms of a minimal phenomenological model of randomly interacting dipoles of
random energies. This model of the plasma forms a starting point to describe
its observed absence of relaxation in terms of many-body localization (MBL).
The large number of accessible Rydberg and excitonic states gives rise to an
unconventional web of many-body interactions that vastly exceeds the complexity
of MBL in a conventional few-level scheme. This experimental platform thus
opens an avenue for the coupling of dipoles in disordered environments that
will demand the development of new theoretical tools.

r-J colors. Because of the intrinsic luminosity of the sample, their rest-frame
optical emission is less extended than the 850um sources (S850>2mJy), and more
extended than the star-forming galaxies in the same redshift range. For the

marginal between faint SMGs and the matched galaxies. Moreover, faint SMGs have
similar Sersic indices and projected axis ratios as star-forming galaxies with

fractions (~70%) of disturbed features at z~=2, and the fractions depend on the

derive kinetic temperatures ranging from ${\sim}5$-$10$ K (in the spiral arms)

${\sim}$400-1000 cm$^{-3}$ (in the spiral arms) to ${\sim}$12500 cm$^{-3}$ (at
the center). From this density modeling, we find a total H$_2$ mass of
$9.6\times10^9 M_{\odot}$, which is ${\sim}50\%$ higher than previous estimates
made using a constant H$_2$-CO conversion factor but is largely dependent on
the assumed vertical distribution of the CO gas. With the exception of the
nuclear region, we also identify a tentative correlation between star formation
efficiency and kinetic temperature. We derive a galactic rotation curve,
finding a peak velocity of ${\sim}207$ km s$^{-1}$ and estimate a total
dynamical mass of $4.94 \pm 0.70 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at a galactocentric

electromagnetic interaction. There are extensions of the standard model in
which $\alpha$ is dynamical on cosmological length and time-scales. The physics
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) depends on the value of $\alpha$. The
effects of spatial variation in $\alpha$ on the CMB are similar to those
produced by weak lensing: smoothing of the power spectrum, and generation of
non-Gaussian features. These would induce a bias to estimates of the
weak-lensing potential power spectrum of the CMB. Using this effect, Planck
measurements of the temperature and polarization power spectrum, as well as
estimates of CMB lensing, are used to place limits (95% C. L.) on the amplitude
of a scale-invariant angular power spectrum of $\alpha$ fluctuations relative
to the mean value ($C_L^{\alpha}=A^\alpha_{\rm SI}/[L(L+1)]$) of $A^\alpha_{\rm
SI}\leq 1.6 \times 10^{-5}$. The limits depend on the assumed shape of the
$\alpha$-fluctuation power spectrum. For example, for a white noise angular
power spectrum ($C_L^{\alpha}=A^\alpha_{\rm WN}$), the limit is $A^\alpha_{\rm
WN}\leq 2.3 \times 10^{-8}$. It is found that the response of the CMB to
$\alpha$ fluctuations depends on a separate-universe approximation, such that
theoretical predictions are only reliable for $\alpha$ multipoles with
$L\lesssim 100$ . An optimal trispectrum estimator can be constructed and it is
found that it is only marginally more sensitive than lensing techniques for
Planck but significantly more sensitive when considering the next generation of
experiments. For a future CMB experiment with cosmic-variance limited
polarization sensitivity (e.g., CMB-S4), the optimal estimator could detect
$\alpha$ fluctuations with $A^\alpha_{\rm SI}>1.9 \times 10^{-6}$ and

fast peak patch simulations combined with the $L_\text{CO}(M_\text{halo})$

luminosity function depends on the luminosity range of interest. In particular,
the VID is more sensitive at both small and large luminosities, while the PS is
more sensitive at intermediate luminosities. The joint analysis is superior to
using either observable separately. When averaging over CO luminosities ranging
between $L_\text{CO} = 10^4-10^7L_\odot$, and over 10 cosmological realizations

an estimation error due to the diverse (and a-priori unknown) morphology of
individual background galaxies. These errors are inversely proportional to the
limiting angular resolution at which localized objects, such as galaxy
clusters, can be probed with weak lensing shear. In this work we report on our
initial attempt to reduce statistical errors in weak lensing shear estimation
using a machine learning approach -- training a multi-layered convolutional

galaxy image. We train, calibrate and evaluate the performance and stability of
our estimator using simulated galaxy images designed to mimic the distribution
of HST observations of lensed background sources in the CLASH galaxy cluster

reduced by approximately 26% when compared to maps produced with a commonly

approximately 60%. However, given the non-transparent nature of the machine

angular structure of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. First, the relatively
narrow observed distribution of $E_{X}/E_{\gamma}$ (the isotropic equivalent
early X-ray afterglow to prompt $\gamma$-ray energy ratio) implies that at any
angle that $\gamma$-rays are emitted the Lorentz factor must be high.
Specifically, the Lorentz factor of $\gamma$-ray emitting material cannot drop
rapidly with angle, and must be $\Gamma(\theta)\gtrsim 50$ even if there are
angles for which the gamma-ray received energy is lower by three orders of
magnitude compared to the jet core. Second, jets with an angular structure of
the $\gamma$-ray emission that over-produce events with a $\gamma$-ray
luminosity below the peak of the observed luminosity function are ruled-out.
This eliminates models in which the $\gamma$-ray energy angular distribution
isn't sufficiently steep and the Lorentz factor distribution isn't sufficiently
shallow. Finally, models with a steep structure (e.g. Gaussian) which are
detected away from the jet core generate afterglow light-curves that were never
observed. We conclude that even if the jet kinetic energy distribution drops
continuously with latitude, efficient $\gamma$-ray emission seems to be
restricted to material with $\Gamma\gtrsim 50$ and is most likely confined to a
narrow region around the core. While our study is confined to long GRBs, where
the observed sample is larger and more complete, there are indications that
similar conclusions may be applicable also to short GRBs. We discuss the
possible implications to the $\gamma$-rays observed in GRB 170817A.

cosmological parameters using galaxy redshift surveys, via an application of
the Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test. Our physical model of the non-linearly
evolved density field, as probed by galaxy surveys, employs Lagrangian
perturbation theory (LPT) to connect Gaussian initial conditions to the final
density field, followed by a coordinate transformation to obtain the redshift
space representation for comparison with data. We generate realizations of
primordial and present-day matter fluctuations given a set of observations.
This hierarchical approach encodes a novel AP test, extracting several orders
of magnitude more information from the cosmological expansion compared to
classical approaches, to infer cosmological parameters and jointly reconstruct
the underlying 3D dark matter density field. The novelty of this AP test lies
in constraining the comoving-redshift transformation to infer the appropriate
cosmology which yields isotropic correlations of the galaxy density field, with
the underlying assumption relying purely on the cosmological principle. Such an
AP test does not rely explicitly on modelling the full statistics of the field.
We verify in depth via simulations that this renders our test robust to model
misspecification. This leads to another crucial advantage, namely that the
cosmological parameters exhibit extremely weak dependence on the currently
unresolved phenomenon of galaxy bias, thereby circumventing a potentially key
limitation. This is consequently among the first methods to extract a large
fraction of information from statistics other than that of direct density
contrast correlations, without being sensitive to the amplitude of density
fluctuations. We perform several statistical efficiency and consistency tests
on a mock galaxy catalogue, using the SDSS-III survey as template.

specifications of the IRIS instrument, we use the IRIS data simulator to
characterize photometric precision and accuracy of the IRIS imager. We present
the results of investigation into the effects of potential ghosting in the IRIS
optical design. Each source in the IRIS imager field of view results in ghost
images on the detector from IRIS's wedge filters, entrance window, and
Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) prism. We incorporated each of these
ghosts into the IRIS simulator by simulating an appropriate magnitude point
source at a specified pixel distance, and for the case of the extended ghosts
redistributing flux evenly over the area specified by IRIS's optical design. We
simulate the ghosting impact on the photometric capabilities, and found that
ghosts generally contribute negligible effects on the flux counts for point
sources except for extreme cases where ghosts coalign with a star of
$\Delta$m$>$2 fainter than the ghost source. Lastly, we explore the photometric
precision and accuracy for single sources and crowded field photometry on the
IRIS imager.

vacua in string theory. Such a criterion should hold at all points in the field
space and especially at points where the system is on-shell. However there has
not been any attempt to examine the swampland criterion against explicit
equations of motion. In this paper we study four-dimensional de Sitter and
quasi-de Sitter solutions using dimensionally reduced M-theory. While on one
hand all classical sources that could allow for solutions with de Sitter
isometries are ruled out, the quantum corrections, on the other hand, are found
to allow for de Sitter solutions provided certain constraints are satisfied. A
careful study however shows that generically such a constrained system does not
allow for an effective field theory description in four-dimensions.
Nevertheless, if some hierarchies between the various quantum pieces could be
found, certain solutions with an effective field theory description might
exist. Such hierarchies appear once some mild time dependence is switched on,
in which case certain quasi-de Sitter solutions may be found without a
violation of the swampland criterion.

algorithm to identify all velocity components along the line-of-sight
correlated with the ATLASGAL dust emission, and derive size, mass, and
kinematic properties for all velocity components. We find two-third of the
filament candidates are coherent structures in position-position-velocity
space. The remaining candidates appear to be the result of a superposition of
two or three filamentary structures along the line-of-sight. At the resolution
of the data, on average the filaments are in agreement with Plummer-like radial
density profiles with a power-law exponent of p = 1.5 +- 0.5, indicating that
they are typically embedded in a molecular cloud and do not have a well-defined
outer radius. Also, we find a correlation between the observed mass per unit
length and the velocity dispersion of the filament of $m \sim \sigma_v^2$. We
show that this relation can be explained by a virial balance between
self-gravity and pressure. Another possible explanation could be radial
collapse of the filament, where we can exclude infall motions close to the
free-fall velocity.

probabilistic predictions, it is standard to use `proper' scoring rules to
perform such scoring. These rules are desirable because they give forecasters
no incentive to lie about their probabilistic beliefs. However, in the real
world context of creating a training program designed to help people improve
calibration through prediction practice, there are a variety of desirable
traits for scoring rules that go beyond properness. These potentially may have
a substantial impact on the user experience, usability of the program, or
efficiency of learning. The space of proper scoring rules is too broad, in the
sense that most proper scoring rules lack these other desirable properties. On
the other hand, the space of proper scoring rules is potentially also too
narrow, in the sense that we may sometimes choose to give up properness when it
conflicts with other properties that are even more desirable from the point of
view of usability and effective training. We introduce a class of scoring rules
that we call `Practical' scoring rules, designed to be intuitive to users in
the context of `right' vs. `wrong' probabilistic predictions. We also introduce
two specific scoring rules for prediction intervals, the `Distance' and `Order
of magnitude' rules. These rules are designed to satisfy a variety of
properties that, based on user testing, we believe are desirable for applied
calibration training.

normal multivariate distribution and, therefore, normal marginal distributions
for each column. If some marginals are continuous but not normal, the

alternative to PCA that combines a Gaussian copula with nonparametric

marginals and accounts for discrete variables in the likelihood calculation by
integrating over appropriate intervals. Like PCA, the factors produced by XPCA
can be used to find latent structure in data, build predictive models, and
perform dimensionality reduction. We present the new model, its induced
likelihood function, and a fitting algorithm which can be applied in the

  The pNGB dark matter particle is stable due to a $\mathrm{U}(1)$

to thermal freeze-out as opposed to the technicolor limit where it is typically

experiments that use interactions with nuclei to detect the neutrino.
  The common reconstruction procedure is based on the kinematics of the
final-state lepton. The interpretation of the reconstructed energy in terms of
the real neutrino energy must rely on a model for the neutrino-nucleus
interaction. The Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model is frequently used in these
analyses. In the Hartree-Fock (HF) model for quasielastic nucleon knockout, the
bound nucleon wave functions are obtained using an effective nucleon-nucleon
force. The final-state wave function is constructed from continuum states in
the same potential which have the correct asymptotic behavior. The Continuum
Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) model extends the HF approach taking long
range correlations into account in a self-consistent way. Considering only
single-nucleon processes, the distributions of reconstructed neutrino energies
obtained within the HF-CRPA approach are compared with the results of the RFG,
an RPWIA calculation, and the RPA+np-nh model of Martini et al.
  We find that the distributions of reconstructed energies for a fixed incoming
energy in the HF-CRPA display additional strength in the low reconstructed
energy tails compared to models without elastic distortion of the outgoing
nucleon. This asymmetry redistributes strength from higher to lower values of
the reconstructed energy. The mean field description of the nuclear dynamics
results in a reshaping of the reconstructed energy distribution that cannot be
accounted for in a plane wave impulse approximation model, even by modifying ad
hoc parameters such as the binding energy. In particular it is shown that in
the RFG calculations there is no value of the binding energy which is able to
reproduce the entire T2K $\nu_\mu$ oscillated spectrum as calculated in
HF-CRPA.

innovate beyond existing approaches by using adversarial training to learn a

pixel-level, which allows networks to incorporate more global information. In
this framework, the generator learns a mapping between RGB images and its
corresponding depth map, while the discriminator learns to distinguish depth
map and RGB pairs from ground truth. This conditional GAN depth estimation
framework is stabilized using spectral normalization to prevent mode collapse
when learning from diverse datasets. We test this approach using a diverse set
of generators that include U-Net and joint CNN-CRF. We benchmark this approach
on the NYUv2, Make3D and KITTI datasets, and observe that adversarial training

arbitrary distributions of cloud properties, provided the cloud volume filling
factor is small; numerical simulations show it to hold up to filling factors of
about 10%. We show that irrespective of the complexity of the cloud ensemble,
the radiative effect of clumpiness can be parametrized at each frequency by a
single multiplicative correction to the overall optical depth; this multiplier
is derived from appropriate averaging over individual cloud properties. Our
main finding is that cloud shapes have only a negligible effect on radiation
propagation in clumpy media; the results of calculations employing point-like
clouds are practically indistinguishable from those for finite-size clouds with
arbitrary geometrical shapes.

full-length mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from elephant shark, a
cartilaginous fish belonging to the oldest group of jawed vertebrates. Based on
their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone,
corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone and 19-norprogesterone are
potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the
physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is
not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fishes. Because progesterone is a
precursor for corticosteroids that activate elephant shark MR, we propose that
progesterone was an ancestral ligand for elephant shark MR. Although
progesterone activates ray-finned fish MRs, progesterone does not activate
human, amphibian or alligator MRs, suggesting that during the transition to
terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR.
Comparison of RNA-sequence analysis of elephant shark MR with that of human MR
suggests that MR expression in the human brain, heart, ovary, testis and other
non-epithelial tissues evolved in cartilaginous fishes. Together, these data
suggest that progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in
elephant shark ovary and testis.

refers to the functional program code and the input that generated the result.
The input itself may be a set of other data citations, such that all data
transformations, from the original data sources to the final result, are
transparently expressed by a directed graph. Functions can be implemented in a
variety of programming languages since data sources are expected to be stored
in open and standardized text-based file formats. A publication is then an

consisting of a point electron and a point proton, interacting with a
modification of Coulomb's law proposed, in the 1940s, by Bopp, Land\'e--Thomas,
and Podolsky (BLTP). The BLTP theory hypothesizes the existence of an
electromagnetic length scale of nature --- the Bopp length $\varkappa ^{-1}$
---, to the effect that the electrostatic pair interaction deviates
significantly from Coulomb's law only for distances much shorter than
$\varkappa^{-1}$. Rigorous lower and upper bounds are constructed for the
Schr\""odinger energy levels of the hydrogen atom, $E_{\ell,n}(\varkappa)$, for
all $\ell\in\{0,1,2,...\}$ and $n >\ell$. The energy levels
$E_{0,1}(\varkappa)$, $E_{0,2}(\varkappa)$, and $E_{1,2}(\varkappa)$ are also
computed numerically and plotted versus $\varkappa^{-1}$. It is found that the
BLTP theory predicts a non-relativistic correction to the splitting of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ line in addition to its well-known relativistic fine-structure
splitting. Under the assumption, that this splitting doesn't go away in a
relativistic calculation, it is argued that present-day precision measurements
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line suggest that $\varkappa^{-1}$ must be smaller than
$\approx 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}$. Finite proton size effects are found not to
modify this conclusion. As a consequence, the electrostatic field energy of an
elementary point charge, although finite in BLTP electrodynamics, is much
larger than the empirical rest energy of an electron. If, as assumed in all
`renormalized theories' of the electron, the empirical rest mass of a physical
electron is the sum of its bare rest mass plus its electrostatic field energy
($/c^2$), then in BLTP electrodynamics the electron has to be assigned a
negative bare rest mass.

of the Schrodinger equation is compatible with a partial Fourier transform
operation. Bulk equations may display unusual features because they are
relative eigenvalue problems for non-Hermitian, bulk-projected Hamiltonians.
Nonetheless, they admit a rich symmetry analysis that can simplify considerably
the structure of energy eigenstates, often allowing a solution in fully
analytical form. We illustrate our extension of the generalized Bloch theorem
to multicomponent systems by determining the exact Andreev bound states for a
simple SNS junction. We then analyze the Creutz ladder model, by way of a
conceptual bridge from one to higher dimensions. Upon introducing a new
Gaussian duality transformation that maps the Creutz ladder to a system of two
Majorana chains, we show how the model provides a first example of a
short-range chiral topological insulator hosting topological zero modes with a
power-law profile. Additional applications include the complete analytical
diagonalization of graphene ribbons with both zigzag-bearded and armchair

tie-breaker designs which are hybrids of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
and regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). We quantify the statistical
efficiency of a tie-breaker design in which a proportion $\Delta$ of observed
subjects are in the RCT. In a two line regression, statistical efficiency
increases monotonically with $\Delta$, so efficiency is maximized by an RCT. We
point to additional advantages of tie-breakers versus RDD: for a nonparametric
regression the boundary bias is much less severe and for quadratic regression,
the variance is greatly reduced. For a two line model we can quantify the short
term value of the treatment allocation and this comparison favors smaller
$\Delta$ with the RDD being best. We solve for the optimal tradeoff between
these exploration and exploitation goals. The usual tie-breaker design applies
an RCT on the middle $\Delta$ subjects as ranked by the assignment variable. We
quantify the efficiency of other designs such as experimenting only in the
second decile from the top. We also show that in some general parametric models
a Monte Carlo evaluation can be replaced by matrix algebra.

Linear Chain Trick (LCT; aka the Gamma Chain Trick): a technique used to
construct mean field ODE models from continuous-time stochastic state
transition models where the time an individual spends in a given state (i.e.,
the dwell time) is Erlang distributed (i.e., gamma distributed with integer
shape parameter). Despite the LCT's widespread use, we lack general theory to
facilitate the easy application of this technique, especially for complex
models. This has forced modelers to choose between constructing ODE models
using heuristics with oversimplified dwell time assumptions, using time
consuming derivations from first principles, or to instead use non-ODE models
(like integro-differential equations or delay differential equations) which can
be cumbersome to derive and analyze. Here, we provide analytical results that
enable modelers to more efficiently construct ODE models using the LCT or
related extensions. Specifically, we 1) provide novel extensions of the LCT to
various scenarios found in applications; 2) provide formulations of the LCT and
it's extensions that bypass the need to derive ODEs from integral or stochastic
model equations; and 3) introduce a novel Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT)
framework that extends the LCT to a much broader family of distributions,
including the flexible phase-type distributions which can approximate
distributions on $\mathbb{R}^+$ and be fit to data. These results give modelers
more flexibility to incorporate appropriate dwell time assumptions into mean

recognition. In the state-of-the-art method, accurate object proposal
algorithms are first leveraged for generating a set of local regions containing
particular landmarks with high confidence. Then, these candidate regions are
represented by deep features and pairwise matching is performed in an
exhaustive manner for the similarity measure. Despite its success, conventional
object proposal methods usually produce massive landmark-dependent image
patches exhibiting significant distribution variance in scale and overlap. As a
result, the inconsistency in landmark distributions tends to produce biased
similarity between pairwise images yielding the suboptimal performance. In
order to gain an insight into the landmark-based place recognition scheme, we
conduct a comprehensive study in which the influence of landmark scales and the
proportion of overlap on the recognition performance is explored. More
specifically, we thoroughly study the exhaustive search based landmark matching
mechanism, and thus derive three-fold important observations in terms of the
beneficial effect of specific landmark generation strategies. Inspired by the
above observations, a simple yet effective dense sampling based scheme is
presented for accurate place recognition in this paper. Different from the
conventional object proposal strategy, we generate local landmarks of multiple
scales with uniform distribution from entire image by dense sampling, and
subsequently perform multi-scale fusion on the densely sampled landmarks for
similarity measure. The experimental results on three challenging datasets
demonstrate that the recognition performance can be significantly improved by
our efficient method in which the landmarks are appropriately produced for
accurate pairwise matching.

individual trees are sensitive to the particular data sets used to train them,
and an interpretation of a student model may be suspect if small changes in the

from a teacher helps to stabilize the greedy splitting strategy by generating a
much larger corpus of training examples than was originally available. We
develop tests to ensure that enough examples are generated at each split so
that the same splitting rule would be chosen with high probability were the
tree to be re trained. Further, we develop a stopping rule to indicate how deep

While binary interactions and their high incidence are generally cited to favor
them as Type IIb SN progenitors, this idea has not been tested using models
covering a broad parameter space. In this paper, we use non-rotating single-
and binary-star models at solar and low metallicities spanning a wide parameter
space in primary mass, mass ratio, orbital period, and mass transfer
efficiencies. We find that our single- and binary-star models contribute to
roughly equal, however small, numbers of Type IIb SNe at solar metallicity.
Binaries only dominate as progenitors at low metallicity. We also find that our
models can account for less than half the observationally inferred rate for
Type IIb SNe at solar metallicity, with computed rates ~<4% of core-collapse
(CC) SNe. On the other hand, our models can account for the rates currently
indicated by observations at low metallicity, with computed rates as high as
15% of CC SNe. However, this requires low mass transfer efficiencies (~<0.1) to
prevent most progenitors from entering contact. We suggest that the stellar
wind mass-loss rates at solar metallicity used in our models are too high.
Lower mass-loss rates would widen the parameter space for binary Type IIb SNe
at solar metallicity by allowing stars that initiate mass transfer earlier in
their evolution to reach CC without getting fully stripped.

generation, in which a discriminative model guides the training of a generative
model to construct images that resemble real images. Recently, GANs have been
extended from generating images to generating sequences (e.g., poems, music and
codes). Existing GANs on sequence generation mainly focus on general sequences,
which are grammar-free. In many real-world applications, however, we need to
generate sequences in a formal language with the constraint of its
corresponding grammar. For example, to test the performance of a database, one
may want to generate a collection of SQL queries, which are not only similar to
the queries of real users, but also follow the SQL syntax of the target
database. Generating such sequences is highly challenging because both the
generator and discriminator of GANs need to consider the structure of the
sequences and the given grammar in the formal language. To address these
issues, we study the problem of syntax-aware sequence generation with GANs, in
which a collection of real sequences and a set of pre-defined grammatical rules
are given to both discriminator and generator. We propose a novel GAN
framework, namely TreeGAN, to incorporate a given Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
into the sequence generation process. In TreeGAN, the generator employs a
recurrent neural network (RNN) to construct a parse tree. Each generated parse
tree can then be translated to a valid sequence of the given grammar. The
discriminator uses a tree-structured RNN to distinguish the generated trees
from real trees. We show that TreeGAN can generate sequences for any CFG and
its generation fully conforms with the given syntax. Experiments on synthetic
and real data sets demonstrated that TreeGAN significantly improves the quality
of the sequence generation in context-free languages.

hydrogenation. These shifts make them prime candidates for many tunable optical
devices, such as optical hydrogen sensors and switchable mirrors. While some of
these metals, such as palladium, have been well studied, many other promising
materials have only been characterized over a limited optical range and lack
direct in situ measurements of hydrogen loading, limiting their potential
applications. Further, there have been no systematic studies that allow for a
clear comparison between these metals. In this work, we present such a
systematic study of the dynamically tunable optical properties of Pd, Mg, Zr,
Ti, and V throughout hydrogenation with a wavelength range of 250 - 1690 nm.
These measurements were performed in an environmental chamber, which combines
mass measurements via a quartz crystal microbalance with ellipsometric
measurements in up to 7 bar of hydrogen gas, allowing us to determine the
optical properties during hydrogen loading. In addition, we demonstrate a
further tunability of the optical properties of titanium and its hydride by
altering annealing conditions, and we investigate the optical and gravimetric
hysteresis that occurs during hydrogenation cycling of palladium. Finally, we
demonstrate several nanoscale optical and plasmonic structures based on these
dynamic properties. We show structures that, upon hydrogenation, demonstrate
five orders of magnitude change in reflectivity, resonance shifts of >200 nm,
and relative transmission switching of >3000%, suggesting a wide range of
applications.

random variable $X$ that is relevant for predicting another random variable
$Y$. To do so, IB identifies an intermediate ""bottleneck"" variable $T$ that has
low mutual information $I(X;T)$ and high mutual information $I(Y;T)$. The ""IB
curve"" characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal
$I(Y;T)$ for a given $I(X;T)$, and is typically explored by maximizing the ""IB
Lagrangian"", $I(Y;T) - \beta I(X;T)$. In some cases, $Y$ is a deterministic
function of $X$, including many classification problems in supervised learning
where the output class $Y$ is a deterministic function of the input $X$. We
demonstrate three caveats when using IB in any situation where $Y$ is a
deterministic function of $X$: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by
maximizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of $\beta$; (2) there are
""uninteresting"" trivial solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for
multi-layer classifiers that achieve low prediction error, different layers
cannot exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary
to a recent proposal. We also show that when $Y$ is a small perturbation away
from being a deterministic function of $X$, these three caveats arise in an
approximate way. To address problem (1), we propose a functional that, unlike
the IB Lagrangian, can recover the IB curve in all cases. We demonstrate the
three caveats on the MNIST dataset.

  Communications",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.98.041302",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identification of the cosmic-ray (CR) `PeVatrons', which are sources capable
of accelerating particles to $\sim10^{15}$ eV energies and higher, may lead to
resolving the long-standing question of the origin of the spectral feature in
the all-particle CR spectrum known as the `knee'. Because CRs with these
energies are deflected by interstellar magnetic fields identification of
individual sources and determination of their spectral characteristics is more
likely via very high energy $\gamma$-ray emissions, which provide the necessary
directional information. However, pair production on the interstellar radiation
field (ISRF) and cosmic microwave background leads to steepening of the
high-energy tails of $\gamma$-ray spectra, and should be corrected for to
enable true properties of the spectrum at source to be recovered. Employing
recently developed three-dimensional ISRF models this paper quantifies the
pair-absorption effect on spectra for sources in the Galactic centre direction
at 8.5 kpc and 23.5 kpc distance, with the latter corresponding to the far side
of the Galactic stellar disc where it is expected that discrimination of
spectral features $>10$ TeV will be possible by the forthcoming Cherenkov
Telescope Array. The estimates made suggest spectral cutoffs could be
underestimated by factors of a few in the energy range so far sampled by TeV
$\gamma$-ray telescopes. As an example to illustrate this, the recent HESS
measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions possibly associated with
injection of CRs nearby Sgr A$^*$ are ISRF-corrected, and estimates of the
spectral cutoff are re-evaluated. It is found that it could be higher by up to
a factor $\sim 2$, indicating that these emissions may be consistent with a CR
accelerator with a spectral cutoff of at least 1 PeV at the 95% confidence
level.

emphasizing that the process is controlled by one parameter $\kappa$ which
classifies the conformal invariant random curves. This process when experiences
some environmental imperfections, or equivalently some scattering random points
(which can be absorbing or repelling) results to some other effective
scale-invariant curves, which are described by the other effective fractal
dimensions and equivalently the other effective diffusivity parameters

generate scattering (absorbing/repelling) points over the lattice in a random
way, that realizes the percolation lattice with which the SLE trace interact.
We find some meaningful power-law changes of the fractal dimension (and also
the effective diffusivity parameter) in terms of the strength of the Henon
coupling, namely the $z$ parameter. For this, we have tested the fractal
dimension of the curves as well as the left passage probability. Our
observations are in support of the fact that this deviation (or equivalently
non-zero $z$s) breaks the conformal symmetry of the curves. Also the effective
fractal dimension of the curves vary with the second power of $z$, i.e.
$D_F(z)-D_F(z=0)\sim z^2$.

this conjecture but its extension to $k$-edge-connected orientations, as well.
We also provide a solution to a discrete version of Megiddo's lexicographically
optimal (fractional) network flow problem (1974, 1977).
  Our main goal is to integrate these cases into a single framework. Namely, we
characterize dec-min elements of an M-convex set (which is nothing but the set
of integral points of an integral base-polyhedron), and prove that the set of
dec-min elements is a special M-convex set arising from a matroid
base-polyhedron by translation. The topic of our investigations may be
interpreted as a discrete counter-part of the work by Fujishige (1980) on the
(unique) lexicographically optimal base of a base-polyhedron. We also exhibit a
canonical chain (and partition) associated with a base-polyhedron. We also show
that dec-min elements of an M-convex set are exactly those which minimize the
square-sum of components, and describe a new min-max formula for the minimum
square-sum. Our approach gives rise to a strongly polynomial algorithm for
computing a dec-min element, as well as the canonical chain. The algorithm
relies on a submodular function minimizer oracle in the general case, which
can, however, be replaced by more efficient classic flow- and matroid
algorithms in the relevant special cases.

capability, while the primary channel is busy, the RF-powered secondary user
(RSU) can either backscatter the primary signal to transmit its own data or
harvest energy from the primary signal (and store in its battery). The
harvested energy then can be used to transmit data when the primary channel
becomes idle. To maximize the throughput for the secondary system, it is
critical for the RSU to decide when to backscatter and when to harvest energy.
This optimal decision has to account for the dynamics of the primary channel,
energy storage capability, and data to be sent. To tackle that problem, we
propose a Markov decision process (MDP)-based framework to optimize RSU's
decisions based on its current states, e.g., energy, data as well as the
primary channel state. As the state information may not be readily available at
the RSU, we then design a low-complexity online reinforcement learning
algorithm that guides the RSU to find the optimal solution without requiring
prior- and complete-information from the environment. The extensive simulation
results then clearly show that the proposed solution achieves higher
throughputs, i.e., up to 50%, than that of conventional methods.

  In this paper, we present an algorithm for generating differentially private

analytically as a probability distribution to adjust the output and compute

the tradeoff between privacy and utility in terms of a ""tolerance for

argued as a key to unveiling the mystery of the high-Tc pairing mechanism. Here
we systematically investigate the pressure-dependent in-plane resistivity and
Hall coefficient (RH ) of a high-quality 112-type Fe-based superconductor
Ca1-xLaxFe1-yCoyAs2 (x = 0.2,y = 0.02). With increasing pressure, the
normal-state resistivity of the studied sample exhibits a pronounced crossover
from non-Fermi-liquid to Fermi-liquid behaviors. Accompanied with this
crossover, Tc is gradually suppressed. In parallel, the extremum in the Hall
coefficient RH (T ) curve, possibly due to anisotropic scattering induced by
spin fluctuations, is also gradually suppressed. The symbiosis of NFL and
superconductivity implies that these two phenomena are intimately related.
Further study on the pressure-dependent upper critical field reveals that the
two-band effects are also gradually weakened with increasing pressure and
reduced to the one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg limit in the low-Tc regime.
Overall, our paper supports the picture that NFL, multigap, and extreme RH (T )

soft X-ray component in the framework of the self-similar solution of the
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around NSs. It is assumed that a
fraction, $f_{\rm th}$, of the energy transferred onto the surface of the NS is
thermalized at the surface of the NS as the soft photons to be scattered in the
ADAF. We self-consistently calculate the structure and the corresponding
emergent spectrum of the ADAF by considering the radiative coupling between the
soft photons from the surface of the NS and the ADAF itself. We show that the
Compton $y$-parameter of the ADAF for NSs is systematically lower than that of
BHs. Meanwhile, we find that the temperature of the thermal soft X-ray
component in NSs decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate, which is
qualitatively consistent with observations. We test the effect of $f_{\rm th}$
on the structure, as well as the emergent spectrum of the ADAF. It is found
that a change of $f_{\rm th}$ can significantly change the temperature of the
thermal soft X-ray component as well as the spectral slope in hard X-rays.
Finally, it is suggested that the value of $f_{\rm th}$ can be constrained by
fitting the high-quality X-ray data, such as the $\it XMM$-$\it Newton$

the realization of advanced optoelectronic devices. La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) is
one of the most promising TOSs because its single crystal exhibits a high
electron mobility. However, in the LBSO films, it is very hard to obtain high
mobility due to the threading dislocations, which are originated from the
lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. Therefore, many
researchers have tried to improve the mobility by inserting a buffer layer.
While the buffer layers increased the electron mobilities, this approach leaves
much to be desired since it involves a two-step film fabrication process and
the enhanced mobility values are still significantly lower than single crystal
values. We show herein that the electron mobility of LBSO films can be improved
without inserting any buffer layers if the films are grown under highly
oxidative ozone (O3) atmospheres. The O3 environments relaxed the LBSO lattice
and reduced the formation of Sn2+ states, which are known to suppress the
electron mobility in LBSO. The resultant O3-LBSO films showed improved mobility
values up to 115 cm2 V-1 s-1, which is among the highest in LBSO films on
SrTiO3 substrates and comparable to LBSO films with buffer layers.

where personalized price reductions or discounted coupons are provided for
attracting more customers. Participants in such a price war scenario have to
invest a lot to catch up with other competitors. However, such a huge cost of
money may not always lead to an improvement of market share. This is mainly due
to a lack of information about others' strategies or customers' willingness
when participants develop their strategies.
  In order to obtain this hidden information through observable data, we study
the relationship between companies and customers in the Internet price war.
Theoretically, we provide a formalization of the problem as a stochastic game
with imperfect and incomplete information. Then we develop a variant of Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to infer latent variables under the current market
environment, which represents the preferences of customers and strategies of
competitors. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that LDA is applied to
game scenario.
  We conduct simulated experiments where our LDA model exhibits a significant
improvement on finding strategies in the Internet price war by including all
available market information of the market maker's competitors. And the model
is applied to an open dataset for real business. Through comparisons on the
likelihood of prediction for users' behavior and distribution distance between
inferred opponent's strategy and the real one, our model is shown to be able to
provide a better understanding for the market environment.
  Our work marks a successful learning method to infer latent information in
the environment of price war by the LDA modeling, and sets an example for
related competitive applications to follow.

generates candidate tree-structured logical forms from utterances using clues
of denotations. These candidates are then ranked based on two criterion: their
likelihood of executing to the correct denotation, and their agreement with the
utterance semantics. We present a scheduled training procedure to balance the

observed in a variety of astrophysical objects, including the circumnuclear
medium of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These are sources of highly energetic
photons (0.2 to 10 keV), exposing the PAHs to a harsh environment. In this
work, we examined experimentally the photoionization and photostability of
naphthalene (C$_{10}$H$_{8}$), anthracene (C$_{14}$H$_{10}$),
2-methyl-anthracene (C$_{14}$H$_{9}$CH$_{3}$) and pyrene (C$_{16}$H$_{10}$)
upon interaction with photons of 275, 310 and 2500 eV. The measurements were
performed at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory using time-of-flight
mass-spectrometry (TOF-MS). We determined the absolute photoionization and
photodissociation cross sections as a function of the incident photon energy;
the production rates of singly, doubly and triply charged ions; and the
molecular half-lives in regions surrounding AGNs. Even considering moderate
X-ray optical depth values ($\tau = 4.45$) due to attenuation by the dusty
torus, the half-lives are not long enough to account for PAH detection. Our
results suggest that a more sophisticated interplay between PAHs and dust
grains should be present in order to circumvent molecular destruction. We could
not see any significant difference in the half-life values by increasing the
size of the PAH carbon backbone, N$_C$, from 10 to 16. However, we show that
the multiple photoionization rates are significantly greater than the single
ones, irrespective of the AGN source. We suggest that an enrichment of multiply
charged ions caused by X-rays can occur in AGNs.

a quantity of interest in the study of astrophysical and atmospheric neutrino
interactions at multi-TeV energies with IceCube. In this work, a sample of
contained neutrino interactions in IceCube is obtained from 5 years of data and
classified as 2650 tracks and 965 cascades. Tracks arise predominantly from
charged-current $\nu_{\mu}$ interactions, and we demonstrate that we can
reconstruct their energy and inelasticity. The inelasticity distribution is
found to be consistent with the calculation of Cooper-Sarkar et al. across the
energy range from $\sim$ 1 TeV to $\sim$ 100 TeV. Along with cascades from
neutrinos of all flavors, we also perform a fit over the energy, zenith angle,
and inelasticity distribution to characterize the flux of astrophysical and
atmospheric neutrinos. The energy spectrum of diffuse astrophysical neutrinos
is well-described by a power-law in both track and cascade samples, and a
best-fit index $\gamma=2.62\pm0.07$ is found in the energy range from 3.5 TeV
to 2.6 PeV. Limits are set on the astrophysical flavor composition that are
compatible with a ratio of
$\left(\frac{1}{3}:\frac{1}{3}:\frac{1}{3}\right)_{\oplus}$. Exploiting the
distinct inelasticity distribution of $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$
interactions, the atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$ to $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ flux ratio in
the energy range from 770 GeV to 21 TeV is found to be $0.77^{+0.44}_{-0.25}$
times the calculation by Honda et al. Lastly, the inelasticity distribution is
also sensitive to neutrino charged-current charm production. The data are
consistent with a leading-order calculation, with zero charm production
excluded at $91\%$ confidence level. Future analyses of inelasticity
distributions may probe new physics that affects neutrino interactions both in
and beyond the Standard Model.

  Conference on Data Mining)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the introduction of the generative adversarial network (GAN) and
its variants has enabled the generation of realistic synthetic samples, which
has been used for enlarging training sets. Previous work primarily focused on
data augmentation for semi-supervised and supervised tasks. In this paper, we
instead focus on unsupervised anomaly detection and propose a novel generative
data augmentation framework optimized for this task. In particular, we propose
to oversample infrequent normal samples - normal samples that occur with small
probability, e.g., rare normal events. We show that these samples are
responsible for false positives in anomaly detection. However, oversampling of
infrequent normal samples is challenging for real-world high-dimensional data
with multimodal distributions. To address this challenge, we propose to use a
GAN variant known as the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to transform the
high-dimensional multimodal data distributions into low-dimensional unimodal
latent distributions with well-defined tail probability. Then, we
systematically oversample at the `edge' of the latent distributions to increase
the density of infrequent normal samples. We show that our oversampling
pipeline is a unified one: it is generally applicable to datasets with
different complex data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, our method
is the first data augmentation technique focused on improving performance in
unsupervised anomaly detection. We validate our method by demonstrating
consistent improvements across several real-world datasets.

drug delivery and microsurgery. Their locomotion, however, is subject to
stringent constraints due to the dominance of viscous over inertial forces at
low Reynolds number (Re) in the microscopic world. Furthermore, locomotory
gaits designed for one medium may become ineffective in a different medium.
Successful biomedical applications of synthetic microswimmers rely on their
ability to traverse biological environments with vastly different properties.
Here we leverage the prowess of machine learning to present an alternative
approach to designing low Re swimmers. Instead of specifying any locomotory
gaits \textit{a priori}, here a swimmer develops its own propulsion strategy
based on its interactions with the surrounding medium via reinforcement
learning. This self-learning capability enables the swimmer to modify its
propulsion strategy in response to different environments. We illustrate this
new approach using a minimal example that integrates a standard reinforcement
learning algorithm ($Q$-learning) into the locomotion of a swimmer consisting
of an assembly of spheres connected by extensible rods. We showcase
theoretically that this first self-learning swimmer can recover a previously
known propulsion strategy without prior knowledge in low Re locomotion,
identify more effective locomotory gaits when the number of spheres increases,
and adapt its locomotory gaits in different media. These results represent
initial steps towards the design of a new class of self-learning, adaptive (or
""smart"") swimmers with robust locomotive capabilities to traverse complex

intensified to investigate how far the intrinsic dynamics of protoplanetary

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is one candidate for explaining the generation of
zonal flows which can lead to local dust enhancements. Adopting a radially
varying cylindrical disk model, and considering combinations of vertical and
azimuthal initial net flux, we perform 3D non-ideal MHD simulations aimed at
studying self-organization induced by the Hall effect in turbulent PPDs. To
this end, new modules have been incorporated into the NIRVANA-III and FARGO3D
MHD codes. We moreover include dust grains, treated in the fluid approximation,
in order to study their evolution subject to the emerging zonal flows. In the
regime of a dominant Hall effect, we robustly obtain large-scale organized
concentrations in the vertical magnetic field that remain stable for hundreds
of orbits. For disks with vertical initial net flux alone, we confirm the
presence of zonal flows and vortices that introduce regions of super-Keplerian
gas flow. Including a moderately strong net-azimuthal magnetic flux can
significantly alter the dynamics, partially preventing the self-organization of
zonal flows. For plasma beta-parameters smaller than 50, large-scale,
near-axisymmetric structures develop in the vertical magnetic flux. In all
cases, we demonstrate that the emerging features are capable of accumulating
dust grains for a range of Stokes numbers.

image texture analysis is applied to an ensemble of high-resolution
quantitative precipitation forecasts. The forecasts are verified against
estimates from a high-resolution regional reanalysis with a similar model
version. The wavelet approach estimates an averaged wavelet spectrum for each
spatial field of the ensemble forecasts and the reanalysis, thereby removing
all information on the localization of precipitation and investigating solely
the overall structure of forecasts and reanalysis. In order to assess skill
using a multivariate score, an additional reduction of dimensionality is
needed. This is performed using singular vectors from a linear discriminant
analysis as it favors data compression in the direction where the ensemble is
most discriminating. We discuss implications of this strategy, show that the
averaged wavelet spectra give valuable information on forecast performance. The
skill difference between a so-called perfect forecast using for verification a
member of the ensemble, and the non-perfect forecast using the reanalysis
points to significant deficiencies of the forecast ensemble. Overall, the
discriminating power solely based on global spectral information is remarkable,
and the COSMO-DE-EPS is a quite good forecast ensemble with respect to the

sensors are in high demand as these sensors are planned to be part of many
instruments currently under development for ground based telescopes. The
pyramid sensor relates the incoming wavefront and its measurements in a
non-linear way. Nevertheless, almost all existing reconstruction algorithms are
based on a linearization of the model. The assumption of a linear pyramid
sensor response is justifiable in closed loop AO when the measured phase
information is small but may not be reasonable in reality due to unpreventable
errors depending on the system such as non common path aberrations. In order to
solve the non-linear inverse problem of wavefront reconstruction from pyramid
sensor data we introduce two new methods based on the non-linear Landweber and
Landweber-Kaczmarz iteration. Using these algorithms we experience high-quality
wavefront estimation especially for the non-modulated sensor by still keeping
the numerical effort feasible for large-scale AO systems.

(S-BS) that supports multiple secondary information decoding (S-ID) and
secondary EH (S-EH) users simultaneously under the condition that interference
power that affects the primary ID (P-ID) receivers should stay below a certain
threshold. The goal of the paper is to develop a generalized precoder design
that maximizes the sum-utility cost function under the transmit power
constraint at the S-BS, and the EH constraint at each S-EH user, and the
interference power constraint at each P-ID user. Therefore, the previous
studies for the CR and SWIPT systems are casted as particular solutions of the
proposed framework. The problem is inherently non-convex and even the weighted
minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) transformation does not resolve the
non-convexity of the original problem. To tackle the problem, we find a
solution from the dual optimization via sub-gradient ellipsoid method based on
the observation that the WMMSE transformation raises zero-duality gap between
the primal and the dual problems. We also propose a simplified algorithm for
the case of a single S-ID user, which is shown to achieve the global optimum.
Finally, we demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of the proposed
algorithms through numerical simulation results.

of the massive MIMO and the artificial noise (AN), namely, {\it AN assisted

enhancement. However, most of previous studies on the ANAM have been built upon
the full channel state information (CSI) assumption at the eavesdropper (ED),
which may be too pessimistic to provide meaningful information on the security
since the channel uncertainty of the ED may degrade its decoding ability. In
this paper, we provide more sophisticated investigation on the performance of
the ANAM system assuming that the CSI of the ED channels are unknown to both
the BS and the ED or partially known to the ED. We measure the secrecy in terms
of both the leakage rate to the ED and the secrecy rate to the legitimate
users, and characterize their upper and lower bounds in the high SNR regime as
a function of the number of ED antennas, the number of data and AN signal
dimensions, and coherence time. Finally, from numerical results, we demonstrate
the accuracy of our analysis and highlight the security potential of the ANAM

J[u]:=\int_\Omega |\Delta u|^2+\chi_{\{u>0\}} \] in the admissible class of
functions \[ \mathcal A:= \left\{u\in W^{2, 2}(\Omega) {\mbox{ s.t. }} u-u_0\in
W^{1,2}_0(\Omega) \right\}. \] Here, $\Omega$ is a smooth and bounded domain
and $u_0\in W^{2,2}(\Omega)$ is a given function defining the Navier type
boundary condition.
  The scale invariance of the problem suggests that, at the singular points of
the free boundary, quadratic growth of $u$ is expected. We prove that $u$ is
quadratically nondegenerate at the singular free boundary points using a
refinement of Whitney's cube decomposition, which applies, if, for instance,
the set $\{ u>0\}$ is a John domain.
  The optimal growth is linked with the approximate symmetries of the free
boundary. More precisely, if at small scales the free boundary can be
approximated by zero level sets of a quadratic degree two homogeneous
polynomial, then we say that $\partial\{ u>0\}$ is rank-2 flat.
  Using a dichotomy method for nonlinear free boundary problems, we also show
that, at the free boundary points $x\in \Omega$ where $\nabla u(x)=0$, the free
boundary is either well approximated by zero sets of quadratic polynomials,
i.e. $\partial\{ u>0\}$ is rank-2 flat, or $u$ has quadratic growth.
  Differently from the classical free boundary problems driven by the Laplacian
operator, the one-phase minimizers present structural differences with respect
to the minimizers, and one notion is not included into the other. In addition,
one-phase minimizers arise from the combination of a volume type free boundary
problem and an obstacle type problem, hence their growth condition is
influenced in a non-standard way by these two ingredients.

criterion to identify and discriminate between the two regimes. Furthermore,
the effects of heat conductivity, viscosity and surface tension on the entropy

the variety of the visual world. We perform our experiments on high resolution

finite-sample efficient among all unbiased estimators with a given strict upper
break-down point. For general heavy-tailed models, we establish the asymptotic
normality of the estimator under second order regular variation conditions and
also show it is minimax rate-optimal in the Hall class of distributions. We
also develop an automatic, data-driven method for the choice of the trimming
parameter which yields a new type of robust estimator that can adapt to the
unknown level of contamination in the extremes. This adaptive robustness
property makes our estimator particularly appealing and superior to other
robust estimators in the setting where the extremes of the data are
contaminated. As an important application of the data-driven selection of the
trimming parameters, we obtain a methodology for the principled identification
of extreme outliers in heavy tailed data. Indeed, the method has been shown to
correctly identify the number of outliers in the previously explored Condroz

include Poisson operators as a special subclass, arise in the description of
topologically constrained diffusion in non-Hamiltonian systems. Extending
previous results, we show that random motion generated by a Beltrami operator
satisfies an H-theorem, leading to a generalized Boltzmann distribution on the

condition is violated, random fluctuations do not work anymore to homogenize
the particle distribution in the coordinate system where they are applied. The
resulting distribution becomes heterogeneous. The heterogeneity depends on the

robots to autonomously navigate by using a recorded video. A visual path is
extracted from the video by extracting some keyframes from the video. The robot
uses this visual path for its navigation. Funnel lane unlike some other methods
does not make use of traditional calculations of Jacobians, homographies,
fundamental matrices, or the focus of expansion, and does not require any
camera calibration. However, funnel lane has some shortcomings. One problem is
that funnel lane gives no information about the radius of rotation, so in
turnings, the robot turns by a constant radius of rotation along the path. This
reduces the maneuverability and limits the robot from dealing with all turnings
conditions. In addition, this problem makes the robot faces a serious problem
in correcting its path when it deviates from the desired path. Another flaw is
that in some situations the robot faces an ambiguity to understand whether a
translation or a rotation should be followed in the visual path which leads the
robot to deviate and to fail in following the desired path. This paper
introduces the sloped funnel lane technique which does not have these
shortcomings. The roll and pitch angles are added to the funnel lane, which
help the robot to set its radius of rotation according to the turnings
conditions it faces. Moreover, they help to reduce the ambiguity between
translation and rotation. Therefore the robot can deal with different turnings
conditions and the navigation method will be more robust and accurate.
Experimental results on challenging scenarios on a real ground robot
demonstrate the effectiveness of sloped funnel lane technique.

$\mathrm{Tor}_{\gg 0}^R(M,\omega) = 0$, where $\omega$ denotes a canonical

Moreover, the vanishing of $\mathrm{Ext}_R^{\gg 0}(\omega,N)$ for certain $ R

such local rings is important.

variability factor higher than $10^3$. Its X-ray spectrum switches between the
typical high/soft state and the steep power-law state during the canonical
outburst. The inner radius of the accretion disk and the disk
temperature--luminosity correlation suggest that P9 harbors a stellar-mass
black hole (BH). At the beginning of the ultraluminous outburst, we observe a
cool outer disk with a hard Comptonized spectrum, implying a transition to the
ULX regime. When the luminosity increases to $L\gtrsim3\times10^{39}$ erg/s, P9
shows a significantly curved spectrum that can be described by either a slim
disk or a strongly curved Comptonized corona. The phenomenological model
suggests that the hot disk observed near the peak of the ultraluminous outburst
is coincidentally consistent with the extension of the thermal track. Utilizing
more physical Comptonized disk models, we suggest that the corona cools down
and the apparent disk-like spectrum is dominated by soft Comptonization. The
significant variability above 1 keV supports this two-component scenario. The
spectral evolution can also be interpreted with the supercritical accretion
model. All these indicate that a canonical black hole X-ray binary can show

is often treated as being essentially a solved computational problem. However,
this is not so, and here I review the evidence for this claim, and outline the
requirements for a solution. The goal of alignment is often stated to be to
juxtapose nucleotides (or their derivatives, such as amino acids) that have
been inherited from a common ancestral nucleotide (although other goals are
also possible). Unfortunately, this is not an operational definition, because
homology (in this sense) refers to unique and unobservable historical events,
and so there can be no objective mathematical function to optimize.
Consequently, almost all algorithms developed for multiple sequence alignment
are based on optimizing some sort of compositional similarity (similarity =
homology + analogy). As a result, many, if not most, practitioners either
manually modify computer-produced alignments or they perform de novo manual
alignment, especially in the field of phylogenetics. So, if homology is the
goal, then multiple sequence alignment is not yet a solved computational
problem. Several criteria have been developed by biologists to help them
identify potential homologies (compositional, ontogenetic, topographical and
functional similarity, plus conjunction and congruence), and these criteria can
be applied to molecular data, in principle. Current computer programs do
implement one (or occasionally two) of these criteria, but no program
implements them all. What is needed is a program that evaluates all of the
evidence for the sequence homologies, optimizes their combination, and thus
produces the best hypotheses of homology. This is basically an inference
problem not an optimization problem.

attention in recent years, with the development of myriad extensions to the

competing risks and recurrent events. Several software packages are now also
available for their implementation. Although mathematically straightforward,
the inclusion of multiple longitudinal outcomes in the joint model remains
computationally difficult due to the large number of random effects required,
which hampers the practical application of this extension. We present a novel
approach that enables the fitting of such models with more realistic
computational times. The idea behind the approach is to split the estimation of
the joint model in two steps; estimating a multivariate mixed model for the
longitudinal outcomes, and then using the output from this model to fit the
survival submodel. So called two-stage approaches have previously been
proposed, and shown to be biased. Our approach differs from the standard
version, in that we additionally propose the application of a correction
factor, adjusting the estimates obtained such that they more closely resemble
those we would expect to find with the multivariate joint model. This
correction is based on importance sampling ideas. Simulation studies show that
this corrected-two-stage approach works satisfactorily, eliminating the bias
while maintaining substantial improvement in computational time, even in more
difficult settings.

giving rise to the desired change of the dispersion relation on the brane. By
compactifying the extra-dimensional theory on an $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold,
deriving the shape of the Kaluza-Klein tower and identifying the effective
sterile neutrino dispersion relation on the brane, we can demonstrate that the
earlier, phenomenological models are recovered as the 4-dimensional effective
field theory limit of the model discussed here.

the transformation of a time varying multipath channel into an almost
non-fading 2D channel in delay-Doppler domain such that all symbols in a

the recent literature that OTFS can extract full diversity in the delay-Doppler

separable in either the delay or Doppler dimension, but without a formal
analysis. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the diversity achieved
by OTFS modulation along with supporting simulations. Specifically, we prove
that the asymptotic diversity order of OTFS (as SNR $\rightarrow \infty$) is
one. However, in the finite SNR regime, potential for a higher order diversity
is witnessed before the diversity one regime takes over. Also, the diversity
one regime starts at lower BER values for increased frame sizes. We also
propose a phase rotation scheme for OTFS using transcendental numbers. We show

inequalities and provide an inexact penalty re-formulation of the problem. The
novelty is in the choice of the penalty functions, which are smooth and can
induce a non-zero penalty over some points in feasible region of the original
constrained problem. The resulting unconstrained penalized problem is
parametrized by two penalty parameters which control the slope and the
curvature of the penalty function. With a suitable selection of these penalty
parameters, we show that the solutions of the resulting penalized unconstrained
problem are \emph{feasible} for the original constrained problem, under some
assumptions. Also, we establish that, with suitable choices of penalty
parameters, the solutions of the penalized unconstrained problem can achieve a
suboptimal value which is arbitrarily close to the optimal value of the
original constrained problem. For the problems with a large number of linear
inequality constraints, a particular advantage of such a smooth penalty-based
reformulation is that it renders a penalized problem suitable for the
implementation of fast incremental gradient methods, which require only one
sample from the inequality constraints at each iteration. We consider applying
SAGA proposed in \cite{saga} to solve the resulting penalized unconstrained
problem. Moreover, we propose an alternative approach to set up the penalized
problem. This approach is based on the time-varying penalty parameters and,
thus, does not require knowledge about some problem-specific properties, that

Unfortunately, traditional CNN methods are not readily transferable to GCNN,

  tables",,,,"cs.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We reconstruct a closed denoised curve from an unstructured and highly noisy
2D point cloud. Our proposed method uses a two- pass approach: Previously
recovered manifold connectivity is used for ordering noisy samples along this
manifold and express these as residuals in order to enable parametric
denoising. This separates recovering low-frequency features from denoising high
frequencies, which avoids over-smoothing. The noise probability density
functions (PDFs) at samples are either taken from sensor noise models or from
estimates of the connectivity recovered in the first pass. The output curve
balances the signed distances (inside/outside) to the samples. Additionally,
the angles between edges of the polygon representing the connectivity become
minimized in the least-square sense. The movement of the polygon's vertices is
restricted to their noise extent, i.e., a cut-off distance corresponding to a
maximum variance of the PDFs. We approximate the resulting optimization model,
which consists of higher-order functions, by a linear model with good
correspondence. Our algorithm is parameter-free and operates fast on the local
neighborhoods determined by the connectivity. We augment a least-squares solver
constrained by a linear system to also handle bounds. This enables us to
guarantee stochastic error bounds for sampled curves corrupted by noise, e.g.,
silhouettes from sensed data, and we improve on the reconstruction error from

stars. This is due to their abundance as well as their small radii and low
masses and temperatures, which facilitate the detection of temperate, rocky
planets in orbit around them. However, the fundamental properties of M dwarfs
are difficult to constrain, often limiting our ability to characterise the
planets they host. Here we test several theoretical relationships for M dwarfs
by measuring 23 high precision, model-independent masses and radii for M dwarfs
in binaries with white dwarfs. We find a large scatter in the radii of these
low-mass stars, with 25 per cent having radii consistent with theoretical
models while the rest are up to 12 per cent over-inflated. This scatter is seen
in both partially- and fully-convective M dwarfs. No clear trend is seen
between the over-inflation and age or metallicity, but there are indications
that the radii of slowly rotating M dwarfs are more consistent with
predictions, albeit with a similar amount of scatter in the measurements
compared to more rapidly rotating M dwarfs. The sample of M dwarfs in close
binaries with white dwarfs appears indistinguishable from other M dwarf
samples, implying that common envelope evolution has a negligible impact on
their structure. We conclude that theoretical and empirical mass-radius
relationships lack the precision and accuracy required to measure the
fundamental parameters of M dwarfs well enough to determine the internal

oscillations of the two layers disperses as $\sqrt q$, while the out-of-phase
mode disperses as $q$. When even one of the layers hosts tilted Dirac cone
spectrum, the plasmonic kink which is a salient feature of a monolayer of

composed of graphene (nontilted) and borophene (tilted) where the two layers
have two different Fermi velocities, the velocity scale of plasmonic modes is
set by the greater of the two. The kink always takes place when each plasmon
mode crosses an energy scale $\omega_{\rm kink}$. When the two layers have
different chemical potentials, there will be two such scales, and each of

remains a long-standing challenge in multimedia. While recent image-text
retrieval methods offer great promise by learning deep representations aligned
across modalities, most of these methods are plagued by the issue of training
with small-scale datasets covering a limited number of images with ground-truth
sentences. Moreover, it is extremely expensive to create a larger dataset by
annotating millions of images with sentences and may lead to a biased model.
Inspired by the recent success of webly supervised learning in deep neural
networks, we capitalize on readily-available web images with noisy annotations
to learn robust image-text joint representation. Specifically, our main idea is
to leverage web images and corresponding tags, along with fully annotated
datasets, in training for learning the visual-semantic joint embedding. We
propose a two-stage approach for the task that can augment a typical supervised
pair-wise ranking loss based formulation with weakly-annotated web images to
learn a more robust visual-semantic embedding. Experiments on two standard
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a significant
performance gain in image-text retrieval compared to state-of-the-art

effects and causal mediation. Conditioning on these variables naively to
estimate marginal effects may inappropriately block causal pathways and may
induce spurious associations between treatment and the outcome, leading to
bias. Although several methods for estimating marginal effects avoid these
complications, including inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted (IPTW)
estimation of marginal structural models (MSMs) as well as g- and
regression-with-residuals (RWR) estimation of highly constrained structural
nested mean models (SNMMs), each suffers from a set of nontrivial limitations.
Specifically, IPTW estimation is inefficient, is difficult to use with
continuous treatments or mediators, and may suffer from finite-sample bias,
while g- and RWR estimation of highly constrained SNMMs for marginal effects
are premised on the unrealistic assumption that there is no effect moderation.
In this study, we adapt the method of RWR to estimate marginal effects with a
set of moderately constrained SNMMs that accommodate several types of
treatment-by-confounder and/or mediator-by-confounder interaction, thereby
relaxing the assumption of no effect moderation. Through a series of simulation
experiments and empirical examples, we show that this approach outperforms IPTW
estimation of MSMs as well as both g- and RWR estimation of highly constrained
SNMMs in which effect moderation is assumed away.

millimetre continuum spectrum, as emitted from the quiet solar atmosphere, may
be used as a diagnostic for the optical thickness regime at the centre of the
observing frequency band.
  Methods. We show the theoretical derivation of the gradient of the millimetre
continuum for both logarithmic- and linear-scale spectra. We compare this
expression with the empirical relationship between the slope of the millimetre
continuum spectrum and the plasma optical thickness computed from both
isothermal and multi-thermal two-dimensional cylindrical radiative transfer
models.
  Results. It is found that the logarithmic-scale spectral gradient provides a
clear diagnostic for the optical thickness regime for both isothermal and
multi-thermal plasmas, provided that a suitable correction is made for a
non-constant gaunt factor over the frequency band. For the use of observers we
present values for this correction at all ALMA bands and at a wide range of
electron temperatures.
  Conclusions. We find that the spectral gradient can be used to find (a)
whether the source is fully optically thin, (b) the optical thickness of the
source if it lies within the transitional regime between optically thin and
thick plasma ({\tau} $\approx$ $10^{-1} - 10^{1}$), or (c) whether the source
is fully optically thick for an isothermal plasma. A multi-thermal plasma will
act the same as an isothermal plasma for case (a), however, the transitional
regime will only extend from {\tau} $\approx$ $10^{-1} - 10^{0}$ . Above {\tau}
= 1 the slope of the continuum will depend increasingly on the temperature
gradient, as well as the optical thickness, reducing the reliability of the
diagnostic.

However, some FRBs appear band-limited, and show apparent scintillation,
complex frequency-dependent structure, or multi-component pulse shapes. While
there is sufficient evidence that FRBs are indeed astrophysical, their one-off
nature necessitates extra scrutiny when reporting a detection as bona fide and
not a false positive. Currently, there is no formal validation framework for
FRBs, rather a set of community practices. In this article, we discuss

  We show that a number of known results obstructing the existence of constant

the arguments of Li and Sano--Tipler in the cscK and extremal cases) that if
$\alpha$ is Hodge, then constant weighted scalar curvature metrics in $\alpha$

visible from Earth under a wide range of illumination conditions, with
phase-angle in the range 16 to 57 degrees. Together with (3200) Phaethon and
(152679) 1998 KU2, observed very recently, Bennu is the only existing example
of a primitive NEO observed in polarimetric mode over a wide interval of phase
angles. Based on our polarimetric data, we propose that Bennu belongs to the
unusual F taxonomic class defined in the 80s. According to previous works, the
F-class includes objects with cometary features. This fact can be of great

accounting fully for the time-dependent and anharmonic trap. We employ our
approach to a detailed study of the stochastic dynamics of a single ion,
drawing general conclusions regarding the nonequilibrium dynamics of
laser-cooled trapped ions. We predict a regime of anharmonic motion in which
laser cooling becomes diffusive (i.e., it is equally likely to cool the ion as
it is to heat it), and can also turn into effective heating. This implies that
a high-energy ion could be easily lost from the trap despite being laser
cooled; however, we find that this loss can be counteracted using a laser
detuning much larger than Doppler detuning.

(bus, subway and train) network, bypassing operational details and focusing on
connectivity. Using a empirically generated graph, a statistical
characterization is made by network metrics. Nearby bus stops and rail
transport stations (subway and train) may or may not be considered as a single
vertex in the network representation of the transport system, depending on how
much an user is willing to walk to shift from one stop/station to another. This
distance radius is then used to group nearby stops/stations as a single vertex
in the network representation of the urban public transport system and then its
properties are studied as a function of this radius. This radius is used as
proxy of the user's willingness to walk until the nearest point to access
transportation. The variation of the measure $ \rho $ leads to changes in the
perception of the topology of the public transport network as shown in this
work. An interesting result was that the network is assortative. Another aspect
investigated was the degree distribution of the network. It was not possible to
distinguish between power-law or a log-normal distribution. An exploratory
model is used to test the robustness of the network by randomly,
deterministically and preferentially targeting the stops and service lines.
According to the grouping radius, aka willingness, different fragmentation
values were obtained under attack simulations. We showed that increasing this
willingness generates great reduction in the number of necessary jumps between

the need for introspection of existing dengue control policies. Prior
understanding of the impacts of control interventions is necessary for their
future implementation. In this paper, we propose and analyze a compartmental
model of dengue to assess the impact of active case finding (ACF) on dengue
disease transmission. Currently, primary prevention of dengue is possible only
with vector control and personal protection from the bites of infected
mosquitoes. Although a few experimental studies are performed to assess ACF in
dengue disease, but this is the first attempt to represent and study the
dynamics of disease using ACF as a control strategy. Local and global dynamics
of the system are studied. We use sensitivity analysis to see the effects of
controllable parameters of the model on the basic reproduction number and total
number of infective population. We find that decrease in the biting rate of
mosquitoes, and increase in the rate of hospitalization and/or notification,
death rate of mosquitoes and ACF for asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals
play crucial role for the reduction of disease prevalence. We calibrate our
model to the yearly dengue cases in eight dengue endemic states of India. The
results of our study show that ACF of symptomatic individuals will have
significant effect on dengue case reduction but ACF of asymptomatic individuals

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1803.02579",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a wide range of semantic segmentation tasks, fully convolutional neural
networks (F-CNNs) have been successfully leveraged to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Architectural innovations of F-CNNs have mainly been on improving
spatial encoding or network connectivity to aid gradient flow. In this article,
we aim towards an alternate direction of recalibrating the learned feature maps
adaptively; boosting meaningful features while suppressing weak ones. The
recalibration is achieved by simple computational blocks that can be easily
integrated in F-CNNs architectures. We draw our inspiration from the recently
proposed 'squeeze & excitation' (SE) modules for channel recalibration for
image classification. Towards this end, we introduce three variants of SE
modules for segmentation, (i) squeezing spatially and exciting channel-wise,
(ii) squeezing channel-wise and exciting spatially and (iii) joint spatial and
channel 'squeeze & excitation'. We effectively incorporate the proposed SE
blocks in three state-of-the-art F-CNNs and demonstrate a consistent
improvement of segmentation accuracy on three challenging benchmark datasets.
Importantly, SE blocks only lead to a minimal increase in model complexity of
about 1.5%, while the Dice score increases by 4-9% in the case of U-Net. Hence,
we believe that SE blocks can be an integral part of future F-CNN
architectures.

Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is extremely helpful to understand
the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more
targeted treatment. Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify ASD, understanding the
data-driven computational decision making procedure has not been previously
explored. Therefore, in this work, we address the problem of interpreting
reliable biomarkers associated with identifying ASD; specifically, we propose a
2-stage method that classifies ASD and control subjects using fMRI images and
interprets the saliency features activated by the classifier. First, we trained
an accurate DNN classifier. Then, for detecting the biomarkers, different from
the DNN visualization works in computer vision, we take advantage of the
anatomical structure of brain fMRI and develop a frequency-normalized sampling
method to corrupt images. Furthermore, in the ASD vs. control subjects
classification scenario, we provide a new approach to detect and characterize
important brain features into three categories. The biomarkers we found by the
proposed method are robust and consistent with previous findings in the
literature. We also validate the detected biomarkers by neurological function
decoding and comparing with the DNN activation maps.

achieve better results. Under realistic choices of the parameters it may lead
to equilibrium vaccination coverage even below the Nash equilibrium. However,
these findings rely on the widely accepted use of Fermi functions for modeling
the probabilities of switching to another strategy. We consider here a more
general functional form of the switching probabilities. It is consistent with
functions that give best fits for empirical data in a widely cited
psychological experiment and involves one additional parameter $\alpha$. This

affect observables through virtual effects. After renormalizing background
quantities (fixed by observations at some pivot scale), all that remains are
logarithmic runnings in correlation functions that are both Planck and slow
roll suppressed. In this paper we show how a large number of hidden fields can
partially compensate this suppression and generate a potentially observable
running in the tensor two point function, consistently inferable courtesy of a
large $N$ resummation. We detour to address certain subtleties regarding loop
corrections during inflation, extending the analysis of [1]. Our main result is
that one can extract bounds on the hidden field content of the universe from
bounds on violations of the consistency relation between the tensor spectral
index and the tensor to scalar ratio, were primordial tensors ever detected.
Such bounds are more competitive than the naive bound inferred from requiring
inflation to occur below the strong coupling scale of gravity if deviations
from the consistency relation can be bounded to within the sub-percent level.
We discuss how one can meaningfully constrain the parameter space of various
phenomenological scenarios and constructions that address naturalness with a
large number of species (such as `N-naturalness') with CMB observations up to
cosmic variance limits, and possibly future 21cm and gravitational wave
observations.

dividing the space-time continuum into arbitrary-shaped space-time elements,

without long-range order. Each field is expressed in terms of scalar expansion
functions with rotationally covariant coefficients. The cosmological constant
was related to the cut-off energy of the quadratic Higgs self-energy. From the
literature, examinations find an experimental break in the cosmic ray energy
spectrum called 'knee' at about 3 [PeV], which agrees with this theoretical
ultraviolet cut-off energy. Moreover, the expansion functions are updated to
plane waves using the Lorentz/Poincar\'e covariant/invariant inner product of
vectors with each four-momentum within the cut-off energy. Due to the
long-range disordered alignment of space-time elements, this study newly
introduces an effective field, which is not in the standard model and lies
within the Planck energy. Particles are then rarely excited to the energy
region between the cut-off energy and the Planck energy via extremely weak
interaction solely with the effective field. The theoretical ultraviolet
cut-off energy is consistent with the experimental phenomena such as the
stability of our Universe, inflation in the early Universe and no detection of
