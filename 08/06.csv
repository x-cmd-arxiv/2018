properties of the more scrutinized group VI semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenides such as MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$. The measurements revealed a
parabolic exciton dispersion for finite momentum $\textbf{q}$ parallel to the
$\Gamma$K direction which allowed the determination of the effective exciton
mass. The dispersion decreases monotonically for momentum exchanges parallel to
the $\Gamma$M high symmetry line. To gain further insight into the excitation
mechanisms, we solved the ab-initio Bethe-Salpeter equation for the system. The
results matched the experimental loss spectra closely, thereby confirming the
excitonic nature of the observed transitions, and produced the
momentumdependent binding energies. The simulations also demonstrated that the
excitonic transitions for $\textbf{q}$ || $\Gamma$M occur exactly along that
particular high symmetry line. For $\textbf{q}$ || $\Gamma$K on the other hand,
the excitations traverse the Brillouin zone crossing various high symmetry
lines. A particular interesting aspect of our findings was that the calculation

generates cognitive models by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) datasets. As a standard pipeline in the MVP analysis, brain patterns in
multi-subject fMRI dataset must be mapped to a shared space and then a
classification model is generated by employing the mapped patterns. However,
the MVP models may not provide stable performance on a new fMRI dataset because
the standard pipeline uses disjoint steps for generating these models. Indeed,
each step in the pipeline includes an objective function with independent
optimization approach, where the best solution of each step may not be optimum
for the next steps. For tackling the mentioned issue, this paper introduces the
Multi-Objective Cognitive Model (MOCM) that utilizes an integrated objective
function for MVP analysis rather than just using those disjoint steps. For
solving the integrated problem, we proposed a customized multi-objective
optimization approach, where all possible solutions are firstly generated, and
then our method ranks and selects the robust solutions as the final results.
Empirical studies confirm that the proposed method can generate superior

where an action-dependence on the geometric sector is assumed. For the
Abelian-Higgs string we derive the dynamical equations and provide the
numerical solutions describing the behavior of the Higgs and gauge fields as
well as the profile of the metric functions for different cases of the

this underlying gravitational theory, by analyzing the deviations both on the
mass per unit length and the deficit angle of the string. Next, we proceed with
an analytical treatment obtaining the solution close to the string axis and
also the corresponding vacuum solution. Our analytical results are also
complemented with the study of a thick cosmic string model, where the defect is
endowed with finite core. In this case we have obtained the proper interior

solution for the exterior geometry which generalizes previous results and leads
to a decreasing of the mass per unit length of the cosmic string.

through single-point barriers is discussed on the basis of a double-layer
heterostructure in the squeezing limit as both the thickness of the layers and
the distance between them tend to zero simultaneously. In this limit, the
electron transmission through a barrier-well structure is derived to be
non-zero at certain discrete values of the system parameters forming the
so-called resonance set, while beyond this set, the structure behaves as a
perfectly reflecting wall. The origin of this phenomenon is shown to result
from the reflection coefficients at the interfaces in the inter-layer space.
The transmission amplitude is computed as a set function defined on the
trihedral angle surface in a three-dimensional parameter space.

Lp norm of the added perturbation is usually used to measure the similarity

attacks perturbing the raw input spaces may fail to capture structural
information hidden in the input. This work develops a more general attack
model, i.e., the structured attack (StrAttack), which explores group sparsity
in adversarial perturbations by sliding a mask through images aiming for
extracting key spatial structures. An ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers)-based framework is proposed that can split the original problem
into a sequence of analytically solvable subproblems and can be generalized to
implement other attacking methods. Strong group sparsity is achieved in
adversarial perturbations even with the same level of Lp norm distortion as the
state-of-the-art attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StrAttack by
extensive experimental results onMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. We also show
that StrAttack provides better interpretability (i.e., better correspondence
with discriminative image regions)through adversarial saliency map (Papernot et

found, solves the background evolution in an analytic way when the dark energy
takes a constant barotropic equation of state, $w_x$. In particular, we analyze
two separate interaction scenarios, namely, when the dark energy is a fluid
other than the vacuum energy (i.e., $w_x \neq -1$) and when it is vacuum energy
itself (i.e., $w_x = -1$). We found that the interacting model with $w_x \neq
-1$ produces stable perturbation at large scales for $w_x < -1$ with the
coupling strength $\xi<0$. Both the scenarios have been constrained with the
latest astronomical data having distinct origin. The analyses show that a very
small interaction with coupling strength is allowed and within 68.3\%
confidence-region, $\xi =0$ is recovered. The analyses further show that a
large coupling strength significantly affects the large scale dynamics of the
universe while according to the observational data the interaction models are
very well consistent with the $\Lambda$-cosmology. Furthermore, we observe that
for the vacuum interaction scenario, the tension on $H_0$ is not released while
for the interacting dark energy scenario with $w_x < -1$, the tension on $H_0$
seems to be released partially because of the high error bars in $H_0$.
Finally, we close the work with the Bayesian evidence which shows that the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology is favored over the two interacting scenarios.

the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows to
investigate the nature of the long-lived high-energy emission observed by Fermi
LAT. Joint broadband spectral modeling of XRT and LAT data reveal that LAT
nondetections of bright X-ray afterglows are consistent with a cooling break in
the inferred electron synchrotron spectrum below the LAT and/or XRT energy
ranges. Such a break is sufficient to suppress the high-energy emission so as
to be below the LAT detection threshold. By contrast, LAT-detected bursts are
best fit by a synchrotron spectrum with a cooling break that lies either
between or above the XRT and LAT energy ranges. We speculate that the primary
difference between GRBs with LAT afterglow detections and the non-detected
population may be in the type of circumstellar environment in which these
bursts occur, with late-time LAT detections preferentially selecting GRBs that
occur in low wind-like circumburst density profiles. Furthermore, we find no
evidence of high-energy emission in the LAT-detected population significantly
in excess of the flux expected from the electron synchrotron spectrum fit to
the observed X-ray emission. The lack of excess emission at high energies could
be due to a shocked external medium in which the energy density in the magnetic
field is stronger than or comparable to that of the relativistic electrons
behind the shock, precluding the production of a dominant synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) component in the LAT energy range. Alternatively, the peak
of the SSC emission could be beyond the 0.1-100 GeV energy range considered for

  Extreme Computing Conference, Waltham, MA USA",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fundamental question in many data analysis settings is the problem of
discerning the ""natural"" dimension of a data set. That is, when a data set is
drawn from a manifold (possibly with noise), a meaningful aspect of the data is
the dimension of that manifold. Various approaches exist for estimating this
dimension, such as the method of Secant-Avoidance Projection (SAP).
Intuitively, the SAP algorithm seeks to determine a projection which best
preserves the lengths of all secants between points in a data set; by applying
the algorithm to find the best projections to vector spaces of various
dimensions, one may infer the dimension of the manifold of origination. That
is, one may learn the dimension at which it is possible to construct a
diffeomorphic copy of the data in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. Using
Whitney's embedding theorem, we can relate this information to the natural
dimension of the data. A drawback of the SAP algorithm is that a data set with
$T$ points has $O(T^2)$ secants, making the computation and storage of all
secants infeasible for very large data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm that generalizes the SAP algorithm with an emphasis on addressing
this issue. That is, we propose a hierarchical secant-based
dimensionality-reduction method, which can be employed for data sets where
explicitly calculating all secants is not feasible.

statistical paradigm that appears in many real-world problems. In this setting,
learning a compact, low-dimensional representation of the data can

is to perform subspace learning to estimate a small set of latent features that
capture the majority of the variance in the original data. Most existing
subspace learning models, such as PCA, assume that the data can be fully
represented by its embedding in one or more latent subspaces. However, in this

low-dimensional space. We propose a hybrid dimensionality reduction technique

remain in the original space. Our model leads to more accurate estimation of

Visually imperceptible perturbations to natural images can easily be crafted

trade-offs between robustness and accuracy, in this paper we thoroughly
benchmark 18 ImageNet models using multiple robustness metrics, including the
distortion, success rate and transferability of adversarial examples between
306 pairs of models. Our extensive experimental results reveal several new
insights: (1) linear scaling law - the empirical $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$
distortion metrics scale linearly with the logarithm of classification error;
(2) model architecture is a more critical factor to robustness than model size,
and the disclosed accuracy-robustness Pareto frontier can be used as an
evaluation criterion for ImageNet model designers; (3) for a similar network
architecture, increasing network depth slightly improves robustness in
$\ell_\infty$ distortion; (4) there exist models (in VGG family) that exhibit
high adversarial transferability, while most adversarial examples crafted from
one model can only be transferred within the same family. Experiment code is

more noise and bias than useful information about the kinematics, and thus
degrade decoding performance. We also show that selecting which waveform

performance substantially. For the data analyzed here, a stepwise search for a
low risk electrode spikes and waveforms joint model yielded a low risk Bayesian
model that is 30% more efficient than the corresponding risk minimized Bayesian
model based on electrode spike trains alone. The joint model was also
comparably efficient to decoding from a risk minimized model based only on

This is achieved by combining a rather general physics-based model (analytical

the physically-informed neural network (PINN) potential, is demonstrated by
developing a general-purpose PINN potential for Al. The potential provides a

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The total flux is recovered by combining
the ALMA data with single-dish data obtained using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope.
The combined map covers a $\sim$13 kpc$^{2}$ field that includes the galactic
center, eastern bar, and spiral arm with a resolution of \timeform{2''.03}
$\times$ \timeform{1''.1} ($\sim$45 pc $\times$ $\sim$25 pc). With a resolution
comparable to typical sizes of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the CO
distribution in the bar and arm is resolved into many clumpy peaks that form
ridge-like structures. Remarkably, in the eastern arm, the CO peaks form two
arc-shaped ridges that run along the arm and exhibit a distinct difference in
the activity of star formation: the one on the leading side has numerous HII
regions associated with it, whereas the other one on the trailing side has only
a few. To see whether GMCs form stars with uniform star formation efficiency
(SFE) per free-fall time (SFEff), GMCs are identified from the data cube and
then cross-matched with the catalog of HII regions to estimate the star
formation rate for each of them. 179 GMCs with a median mass of 1.6 $\times$
10$^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ are identified. The mass-weighted average SFEff of the
GMCs is $\sim$9.4 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, which is in agreement with models of
turbulence regulated star formation. Meanwhile, we find that SFEff is not
universal within the mapped region. In particular, one of the arm ridges shows
a high SFEff with a mass-weighted value of $\sim$2.7 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$, which
is higher by more than a factor of 5 compared to the inter-arm regions. This
large regional variation in SFEff favors the recent interpretation that GMCs do
not form stars at a constant rate within their lifetime.

bidispersity is quantified by the difference in the Stokes number of the
particles $|\Delta St|$. We first consider the mean-square separation of
bidisperse particle-pairs and find that without gravity (i.e. $Fr = \infty$),
bidispersity leads to an enhancement of the the mean-square separation over a
significant range of scales. When $|\Delta St|\geq O(1)$, the relative
dispersion is further enhanced by gravity due to the large difference in the
settling velocities of the two particles. However, when $|\Delta St|\ll1$,
gravity suppresses the relative dispersion as the settling velocity
contribution is small, and gravity suppresses the non-local contribution to the
particle dynamics. In order to gain further insights, we consider separately
the relative dispersion in the vertical (parallel to gravity) and horizontal
directions. As expected, the vertical relative dispersion can be strongly
enhanced by gravity due to differences in the settling velocities of the two
particles. However, a key finding of our study is that gravity can also
significantly enhance the horizontal relative dispersion. This non-trivial
effect occurs because fast settling particles experience rapid fluctuations in
the fluid velocity field along their trajectory, leading to enhanced particle
accelerations and relative velocities. For sufficiently large initial particle

understanding is to use the analogy of pouring water over a pool with

discovered during the evolution of wireless networks. To obtain the solution

mathematical formulations. Thus, algorithm design is a key issue for the
practical use of water-filling solutions, which however has been given marginal
attention in the literature. Many existing algorithms are designed on a
case-by-case basis for the variations of water-filling solutions and/or with
complex logics. In this paper, a new viewpoint for water-filling solutions is
proposed to understand the problem dynamically by considering changes in the
increasing rates on different subchannels. This fresh viewpoint provides useful
mechanism and fundamental information in finding the optimization solution
values. Based on the new understanding, a novel and comprehensive method for
practical water-filling algorithm design is proposed, which can be used for
systems with various performance metrics and power constraints, even for

disk-dominated/spiral galaxies decrease gradually in all stellar mass bins and
different environments; (ii) With the analysis of morphological and structural

argue that the advanced anticipation and timely impede of invasion is more

regarding prediction are analyzing short term of system-calls to predict

remarkable performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with long

in monitoring and control scenarios. Another important performance metric in
these applications is energy consumption, since monitors or sensors are usually
energy constrained. In this paper, we study the energy-age tradeoff in a status
update system where data transmission from a source to a receiver may encounter
failure due to channel error. As the status sensing process consumes energy,
when a transmission failure happens, the source may either retransmit the
existing data to save energy for sensing, or sense and transmit a new update to
minimize age-of-information. A threshold-based retransmission policy is
considered where each update is allowed to be transmitted no more than M times.
Closed-form average age-of-information and energy consumption is derived and
expressed as a function of channel failure probability and maximum number of
retransmissions M. Numerical simulations validate our analytical results, and
illustrate the tradeoff between average age-of-information and energy
consumption.

contrast to prior work studying jamming only at the physical or link layer, we
study the real impact of such attacks on end users, namely train journey time
and passenger congestion. Our analysis employs a detailed model of leaky
medium-based communication system (leaky waveguide or leaky feeder/coaxial
cable) popularly used in CBTC systems. To counteract the jamming attacks, we
develop a mitigation approach based on frequency hopping spread spectrum taking
into account domain-specific structure of the leaky-medium CBTC systems.
Specifically, compared with existing implementations of FHSS, we apply FHSS not
only between the transmitter-receiver pair but also at the track-side
repeaters. To demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this technology in
CBTC systems, we develop a FHSS repeater prototype using software-defined
radios on both leaky-medium and open-air (free-wave) channels. We perform
extensive simulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains and

evaluate this possibility by deriving the conditions under which a spheroidal,

this value for all star clusters. Data on the central surface mass density of
compact stellar systems, while sparse and partly confused by dynamical effects,
are broadly consistent with the existence of a metallicity-dependent
upper-limit comparable to this value. Our results imply that this limit may

homogeneous architectures to improve the energy-efficiency of computer systems.
Composite Cores Architecture (CCA), a class of dynamic heterogeneous
architectures enabling the computer system to construct the right core at
run-time for each application by composing cores together to build larger core
or decomposing a large core into multiple smaller cores. While this
architecture provides more flexibility for the running application to find the
best run-time settings to maximize energy-efficiency, due to the
interdependence of various tuning parameters such as the type of the core,
run-time voltage and frequency and the number of threads, it makes it more
challenging for scheduling. Prior studies mainly addressed the scheduling
problem in CCAs by looking at one or two of these tuning parameters. However,
as we will show in this paper, it is important to concurrently optimize and
fine-tune these parameters. In addition, most previous works on CCA mainly
study traditional single threaded CPU applications. This paper describes a
systematic approach to predict the right configurations for running
multithreaded workloads on CCAs. It achieves this by developing a machine
learning-based approach to predict core type, voltage and frequency setting to
maximize the energy-efficiency. Our predictor learns offline from an extensive
set of training multithreaded workloads. It is then applied to predict the
optimal processor configuration at run-time by taking into account the
multithreaded application characteristics and the optimization objective. For
this purpose, five well-known machine learning models are implemented for
energy-efficiency optimization and precisely compared in terms of accuracy and
hardware overhead to guide the scheduling decisions in a CCA.

angular diameters between about 3 and 4 degrees). There is a clear cut-off at
that size, indicating that each anomalous spot would have originated from a
highly energetic point-like source, located at the end of inflation -- or else
point-like at the conformally expanded Big Bang, if it is considered that there
was no inflationary phase. The significant presence of these anomalous spots,
was initially noticed in the Planck 70 GHz satellite data by comparison with
1000 standard simulations, and then confirmed by extending the comparison to
10000 simulations. Such anomalous points were then found at precisely the same
locations in the WMAP data, their significance confirmed by comparison with
1000 WMAP simulations. Planck and WMAP have very different noise properties and
it seems exceedingly unlikely that the observed presence of anomalous points in
the same directions on both maps may come entirely from the noise.
Subsequently, further confirmation was found in the Planck data by comparison
with 1000 FFP8.1 MC simulations (with $l \leq 1500$). The existence of such
anomalous regions, resulting from point-like sources at the conformally
stretched-out big bang, is a predicted consequence of conformal cyclic
cosmology (CCC), these sources being the Hawking points of the theory,
resulting from the Hawking radiation from supermassive black holes in a cosmic
aeon prior to our own.

property of always being available and thus to be able to constantly update the
user with information, such as by notifications. While research has been done
in sophisticated notifications, devices today mainly stick to a binary level of
information, while they are either attention drawing or silent. In this paper,
we want to go further and propose scalable notifications, which adjust the
intensity reaching from subtle to obtrusive and even going beyond that level,
while forcing the user to take action. To illustrate the technical feasibility
and validity of this concept, we developed three prototypes providing
mechano-pressure, thermal, and electrical feedback and evaluated them in
different lab studies. Our first prototype provides subtle poking through to
high and frequent pressure on the user's spine, which creates a significantly
improved back posture. In a second scenario, the users are enabled to perceive
the overuse of a drill by an increased temperature on the palm of a hand until
the heat is intolerable and the users are forced to eventually put down the
tool. The last project comprises a speed control in a driving simulation, while
electric muscle stimulation on the users' legs conveys information on changing
the car's speed by a perceived tingling until the system independently forces
the foot to move. Although our selected scenarios are long way from being
realistic, we see these lab studies as a means to validate our
proof-of-concept. In conclusion, all studies' findings support the feasibility
of our concept of a scalable notification system, including the system of
forced intervention. While we envisage the implementation of our
proof-of-concept into future wearables, more realistic application scenarios

fitting procedure that is robust to the effects of Eddington bias and sample
variance. Surprisingly, when fitting a two-component Schechter function, we
find essentially no evidence of temporal evolution in $M_\star$, the two
$\alpha$ slope parameters, or the normalisation of the low-mass component.
Instead, our fits suggest that the various shape parameters have been
exceptionally stable over cosmic time, as has the normalisation of the low-mass
component, and that the evolution of the stellar-mass function is well
described by a simple build up of the high-mass component over time. When
fitting a single component Schechter function, there is an observed evolution
in both $M_\star$ and $\alpha$, however this is interpreted as being an
artefact. Finally, we find that the evolution of the stellar-mass function, and
the observed stellar mass density, can be well described by a simple model of

LoRaWAN, with its physical (PHY) layer design and regulatory efforts, has
emerged as the widely adopted LPWAN solution. By using chirp spread spectrum
modulation with qausi-orthogonal spreading factors (SFs), LoRa PHY offers
coverage to wide-area applications while supporting high-density of devices.
However, thus far its scalability performance has been inadequately modeled and
the effect of interference resulting from the imperfect orthogonality of the

Harvesting protocols of the vacuum entanglement had been investigated, but its
efficiency is very low to date. The main reason of the low efficiency
originates from the fact that the extracted entanglement is embedded in a mixed
state of two external devices. We propose a general protocol with high
efficiency by extracting pure state entanglement from the field. We only use
bi-linear interactions between the fields and external devices. Even though the
ultraviolet cutoff remains finite, the protocol is capable of extracting a huge
amount of entanglement. Hence the infinite amount of entanglement extraction is
attained without the ultraviolet divergence of the field entanglement entropy
in a continuum limit. There exists a trade-off relation between the extracted
entanglement and its energy cost.

As neural networks become deeper, the ability in manually optimizing the

manual training process while keeping the higher accuracy level. However, the

becoming a challenging task need to be addressed immediately. Few researchers
have attempted to optimize the network structure using evolutionary computing

evolutionary programming into deep convolution neural networks. These attempts
are mainly evolved the network structure and then subsequently optimized the

capillarity and viscous drag forces in the absence of inertia and gravitational
effects over the entire experimental times studied, ranging from a few seconds
up to 10 days. A video on the infiltration process corroborates a collective
pore filling as well as pronounced imbibition front broadening resulting from
the capillarity and permeability disorder, typical of Vycor glasses. The
transport process is analyzed within a Darcy scale description, considering a
generalized pre-factor of the L-W law, termed Lucas-Washburn-Darcy imbibition
ability. It assumes a Hagen-Poiseuille velocity profile in the pores and
depends on the porosity, the mean pore diameter, the tortuosity and the
velocity slip length and thus on the effective hydraulic pore diameter. For
both matrices a reduced imbibition speed and thus reduced imbibition ability,
compared to the one assuming the nominal pore diameter, bulk fluidity and bulk
capillarity, can be quantitatively traced to an immobile, pore-wall adsorbed
boundary layer of 1.4 nm thickness. Presumably, it consists of a monolayer of
water molecules adsorbed on the hydrophilic pore walls covered by a monolayer

by a single profile, that we fit by a simple eighth-order polynomial, as a
function of the star's radius. This new generic profile applies remarkably well
to all magnetized neutron star configurations built on hadronic equations of

spherical symmetry, using a modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) system of

mass-radius diagrams than previous attempts to add magnetic terms to these

non-magnetized TOV models, and that consistent models must depart from
spherical symmetry. Thus, our `universal' magnetic field profile is intended to
serve as a tool for nuclear physicists to obtain estimates of magnetic field

are increasingly abundant at high redshifts. They are believed to be dusty
starbursts, and hence should have high rates of supernovae (multiple events per
year). Due to their extremely dusty environment, however, such supernovae could
only be detected in restframe infrared and longer wavelengths, where our
current facilities lack the capability of finding them individually beyond the
local universe. We propose a new technique for higher redshifts, which is to
search for the presence of supernovae through the variability of the integrated
rest-frame infrared light of the entire hosts. We present a pilot study to
assess the feasibility of this technique. We exploit a unique region, the ""IRAC
Dark Field"" (IDF), that the Spitzer Space Telescope has observed for more than
14 years in 3--5 micron. The IDF also has deep far-infrared data (200--550
micron) from the Herschel Space Observatory that allow us to select
high-redshift (U)LIRGs. We obtain a sample of (U)LIRGs that have secure optical
counterparts, and examine their light curves in 3--5 micron. While the
variabilities could also be caused by AGNs, we show that such contaminations
can be identified. We present two cases where the distinct features in their
light curves are consistent with multiple supernovae overlapping in time.
Searching for supernovae this way will be relevant to the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) to probe high-redshift (U)LIRGs into their nuclear regions
where JWST will be limited by its resolution.

diameter distance and luminosity distance through a simple formula
$D_A(z)(1+z)^2/D_L(z)\equiv1$, is an important relation in cosmology.
Therefore, testing the validity of DDR is of great importance. In this paper,
we test the possible violation of DDR using the available local data including
type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), galaxy clusters and baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO). We write the modified DDR as $D_A(z)(1+z)^2/D_L(z)=\eta(z)$, and
consider two different parameterizations of $\eta(z)$, namely
$\eta_1(z)=1+\eta_0 z$ and $\eta_2(z)=1+\eta_0 z/(1+z)$. The luminosity
distance from SNe Ia are compared with the angular diameter distance from
galaxy clusters and BAO at the same redshift. Two different cluster data are
used here, i.e. elliptical clusters and spherical clusters. The parameter
$\eta_0$ is obtained using the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. It is found
that $\eta_0$ can be strictly constrained by the elliptical clusters + BAO
data, with the best-fitting values $\eta_0=-0.04\pm 0.12$ and $\eta_0=-0.05\pm
0.22$ for the first and second parametrizations, respectively. However, the
spherical clusters + BAO data couldn't strictly constrain $\eta_0$ due to the
large intrinsic scatter. In any case studied here, no evidence for the
violation of DDR is found.

perturbations, which imposes a serious threat to DNN-based decision systems. In
this paper, we propose to apply the lossy Saak transform to adversarially
perturbed images as a preprocessing tool to defend against adversarial attacks.
Saak transform is a recently-proposed state-of-the-art for computing the
spatial-spectral representations of input images. Empirically, we observe that
outputs of the Saak transform are very discriminative in differentiating
adversarial examples from clean ones. Therefore, we propose a Saak transform
based preprocessing method with three steps: 1) transforming an input image to
a joint spatial-spectral representation via the forward Saak transform, 2)
apply filtering to its high-frequency components, and, 3) reconstructing the
image via the inverse Saak transform. The processed image is found to be robust
against adversarial perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments to
investigate various settings of the Saak transform and filtering functions.
Without harming the decision performance on clean images, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods by a substantial
margin on both the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Importantly, our results
suggest that adversarial perturbations can be effectively and efficiently
defended using state-of-the-art frequency analysis.

frequently used methods for solving linear multiobjective optimization
problems. These algorithms have two intertwined components: one-dimensional
linear optimization one one hand, and a combinatorial part closely related to
vertex numeration on the other. Their separation provides a deeper insight into
Benson's algorithm, and points toward a dual approach. Two skeletal algorithms
are defined which focus on the combinatorial part. Using different
single-objective optimization problems - called oracle calls - yield different
algorithms, such as a sequential convex hull algorithm, another version of
Benson's algorithm with the theoretically best possible iteration count, the
dual algorithm of Ehrgott, L\""ohne and Shao, and the new algorithm. The new
algorithm has several advantages. First, the corresponding one-dimensional
optimization problem uses the original constraints without adding any extra
variables or constraints. Second, its iteration count meets the theoretically
best possible one. As a dual algorithm, it is sequential: in each iteration it
produces an extremal solution, thus can be aborted when a satisfactory solution
is found. The Pareto front can be ""probed"" or ""scanned"" from several directions
at any moment without adversely affecting the efficiency. Finally, it is well
suited to handle highly degenerate problems where there are many linear
dependencies among the constraints. On problems with ten or more objectives the
implementation shows a significant increase in efficiency compared to Bensolve
- due to the reduced number of iterations and the improved combinatorial
handling.

functionalities. Although many future Internet architectures and protocols have
been proposed to fulfill such needs, ISPs have been reluctant to deploy many of

many of these new proposals are technically sound. In this paper, we take an
economic perspective and seek to answer: Why most new Internet architectures
failed to be deployed? How to enhance the deployability of a new architecture?
We develop a game-theoretic model to characterize the outcome of an
architecture's deployment through the equilibrium of ISPs' decisions. This
model enables us to: (1) analyze several key factors of the deployability of a
new architecture such as the number of critical ISPs and the change of routing
path; (2) explain the deploying outcomes of some previously proposed
architectures/protocols such as IPv6, DiffServ, CDN, etc., and shed light on
the ""Internet flattening phenomenon""; (3) predict the deployability of a new
architecture such as NDN, and compare its deployability with competing
architectures. Our study suggests that the difficulty to deploy a new Internet
architecture comes from the ""coordination"" of distributed ISPs. Finally, we
design a coordination mechanism to enhance the deployability of new

three key performance measures: (a) The number of transactions in the queue,

properties, ignoring correlations between different planets of the same system.
For multi-planetary systems, planetary data are generally correlated. This is
because, the differential masses and radii are better constrained than absolute
planetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to
the multiplanetary-system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our
understanding of planet interiors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky
interior of planets in a multi-planetary system can be preferentially probed by
studying the most dense planet representing a rocky interior analogue. Our
methodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain
Monte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated
variability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water
oceans and ice layers, and a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior
estimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) that the
importance of inter-dependent planetary data for interior characterization is
comparable to changes in data precision by 30 %. For the interiors of
TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range
from 0-25 %. The lack of a clear trend of water budgets with orbital period or
planet mass challenges possible formation scenarios. While our estimates change
relatively little with data precision, they critically depend on data accuracy.
If planetary masses varied within ~24 %, interiors would be consistent with
uniform (~7 %) or an increasing water mass fractions with orbital period (~2-12
%).

Previous studies also revealed that people tend to form very different mental
representations of stimuli on the basis of their physical distance. In this
regard, embodied cognition proposes that different physical distances between
individuals activate different interpersonal processing modes, such that close
physical distance tends to activate the interpersonal processing mode typical
of socially and affectively close relationships. In Experiment 1, two groups of
participants were administered a pain decision task involving upright and
inverted face stimuli painfully or neutrally stimulated, and we monitored their
neural empathic reactions by means of event-related potentials (ERPs)
technique. Crucially, participants were presented with face stimuli of one of
two possible sizes in order to manipulate retinal size and perceived physical
distance, roughly corresponding to the close and far portions of social
distance. ERPs modulations compatible with an empathic reaction were observed
only for the group exposed to face stimuli appearing to be at a close social
distance from the participants. This reaction was absent in the group exposed
to smaller stimuli corresponding to face stimuli observed from a far social
distance. In Experiment 2, one different group of participants was engaged in a
match-to-sample task involving the two-size upright face stimuli of Experiment
1 to test whether the modulation of neural empathic reaction observed in
Experiment 1 could be ascribable to differences in the ability to identify
faces of the two different sizes. Results suggested that face stimuli of the
two sizes could be equally identifiable. In line with the Construal Level and
Embodied Simulation theoretical frameworks, we conclude that perceived physical
distance may shape empathy as well as social and affective distance.

of the index of corrosion in non-destructive testing. We show a monotonicity
estimates between the Robin coefficient and the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator.
We prove a global uniqueness result and Lipschitz stability estimate, and show
how to quantify the Lipschitz stability constant for a given setting.
  Our quantification of the Lipschitz constant does not rely on quantitative
unique continuation or analytic estimates of special functions. Instead of
deriving an analytic estimate, we show that the Lipschitz constant for a given
setting can be explicitly calculated from the a priori data by solving finitely
many well-posed PDEs. Our arguments rely on standard (non-quantitative) unique
continuation, a Runge approximation property, the monotonicity result and the
method of localized potentials.
  To solve the problem numerically, we reformulate the inverse problem into a
minimization problem using a least square functional. The reformulation of the
minimization problem as a suitable saddle point problem allows us to obtain the
optimality conditions by using differentiability properties of the min-sup
formulation. The reconstruction is then performed by means of the BFGS
algorithm. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the
efficiency of the proposed alogorithm.

present work, $2^3S$ positronium is produced - in absence of electric field -
via spontaneous radiative decay from the $3^3P$ level populated with a 205nm UV
laser pulse. Thanks to the short temporal length of the pulse, 1.5 ns
full-width at half maximum, different velocity populations of a positronium
cloud emitted from a nanochannelled positron/positronium converter were
selected by delaying the excitation pulse with respect to the production
instant. $ 2^3S $ positronium atoms with velocity tuned between $ 7 \cdot 10^4

  Rate Splitting: Optimality and Non-Optimality for MIMO Broadcast Channels""",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a general K-user Gaussian multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC). We assume that the channel state
is deterministic and known to all the nodes. While the private-message capacity
region is well known to be achievable with dirty paper coding (DPC), we are
interested in the simpler linearly precoded transmission schemes. In
particular, we focus on linear precoding schemes combined with rate-splitting
(RS). First, we derive an achievable rate region with minimum mean square error
(MMSE) precoding at the transmitter and joint decoding of the sub-messages at
the receivers. Then, we study the achievable sum rate of this scheme and obtain
two findings: 1) an analytically tractable upper bound on the sum rate that is
shown numerically to be a close approximation, and 2) how to reduce the number
of active streams -- crucial to the overall complexity -- while preserving the
sum rate to within a constant loss. The latter results in two practical
algorithms: a stream elimination algorithm and a stream ordering algorithm.
Finally, we investigate the constant-gap optimality of linearly precoded RS
with respect to the capacity. Our result reveals that, while the achievable
rate of linear precoding alone can be arbitrarily far from the capacity, the
introduction of RS can help achieve the capacity region to within a constant
gap in the two-user case. Nevertheless, we prove that the RS scheme's
constant-gap optimality does not extend to the three-user case. Specifically,
we show, through a pathological example, that the gap between the sum rate and
the sum capacity can be unbounded.

evolution of stars. Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of
angular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating
stably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modeled and its
strength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent
transport is anisotropic. Only phenomenological prescriptions have been
proposed for the transport in the horizontal direction, which however
constitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar
hydrodynamics in evolution codes. We derive a new theoretical prescription for
the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral
formalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification,
rotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent
transport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of
the radial differential rotation is derived. We implement this framework in the
stellar evolution code STAREVOL and quantify its impact on the rotational and
structural evolution of low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red
giant branch. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as
$N^4\tau^2/\left(2\Omega^2\right)$, $N$ and $\Omega$ being the buoyancy and
rotation frequencies respectively and $\tau$ a time characterizing the source
of turbulence. This leads to a horizontal turbulent transport of similar
strength in average that those obtained with previously proposed prescriptions
even if it can be locally larger below the convective envelope. As a
consequence, a complementary transport mechanism like internal gravity waves or
magnetic fields is still needed to explain the observed strong transport of
angular momentum along stellar evolution.

we discern acoustic analogue black hole spacetimes experienced by linear
perturbations of the velocity potential. For vanishingly small diffusivity of
the active particles, linear perturbations of the active particle concentration
reveal a profile with an enhancement close to the acoustic horizon, hinting
towards the possibility of partial trapping of active matter by the acoustic
black hole. We further show that, as anticipated, the dynamical nature of the
orientation (`polarization') of individual particles indeed opens up the
possibility of their use as freely-precessing gyroscopes. In addition,
inclusion of diffusivity of active particles in the inviscid solvent is shown
to lead to a small effective viscosity. Depending on the sign of the diffusion
coefficient, this can either yield superfluid-like behaviour, or enhance the
net viscosity, of the nematic system. In either situation, acoustic
superradiance, theoretically analyzed and experimentally observed recently for
mildly viscous standard fluids, is thus predicted to occur for nematic fluids.

approach to HBPE utilizes the matrix completion method in a transductive
setting to predict pose labels for unobserved samples. Based on this approach,
the proposed method tackles HBPE when manually annotated ground truth labels
are temporally sparse. We posit that the current state of the art approach
oversimplifies the temporal sparsity assumption by using Laplacian smoothing.
Our final solution uses: i) Gaussian process regression in place of Laplacian
smoothing, ii) head and body coupling, and iii) nuclear norm minimization in
the matrix completion setting. The model is applied to the challenging SALSA
dataset for benchmark against the state-of-the-art method. Our presented
formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly in this particular
setting, e.g. at 5% ground truth labels as training data, head pose accuracy
and body pose accuracy is approximately 62% and 70%, respectively. As well as
fitting a more flexible model to missing labels in time, we posit that our
approach also loosens the head and body coupling constraint, allowing for a
more expressive model of the head and body pose typically seen during
conversational interaction in groups. This provides a new baseline to improve
upon for future integration of multimodal sensor data for the purpose of HBPE.

be highly displaced from the quiet-day configuration when interacting with the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), an asymmetry largely controlled by the
dawn-dusk component of the IMF. The corresponding ionospheric convection has
revealed that footprints in one hemisphere tend to move faster to reduce the
displacement, a process we refer to as the restoring of symmetry. Although the
influence on the return flow convection from the process of restoring symmetry
has been shown to be strongly controlled by the IMF, the influence from
internal magnetospheric processes has been less investigated. We use 14 years
of line-of-sight measurements of the ionospheric plasma convection from the
Super Dual Auroral Radar Network to produce high-latitude convection maps
sorted by season, IMF, and geomagnetic activity. We find that the restoring
symmetry flows dominate the average convection pattern in the nightside
ionosphere during low levels of magnetotail activity. For increasing
magnetotail activity, signatures of the restoring symmetry process become less
and less pronounced in the global average convection maps. We suggest that tail
reconnection acts to reduce the asymmetric state of the closed magnetosphere by
removing the asymmetric pressure distribution in the tail set up by the IMF
$\mathit{B}_{y}$ interaction. During active periods the nightside magnetosphere
will therefore reach a more symmetric configuration on a global scale. These
results are relevant for better understanding the dynamics of flux tubes in the
asymmetric geospace, which is the most common state of the system.

this paper, we investigate how the formation of pebbles in the cold outer

disk can alter the gas-phase CO distribution both interior and exterior to the
midplane CO snowline. By simulating the resulting CO abundances in the midplane
as well as the warm surface layer, we identify observable signatures of
large-scale pebble formation and migration that can be used as `smoking guns'
for these important processes. Specifically, we find that after
$1\mathrm{~Myr}$, the formation and settling of icy pebbles results in the
removal of up to $80\%$ of the CO vapor in the warm ($T>22\mathrm{~K}$) disk
layers outside the CO snowline, while the radial migration of pebbles results
in the generation of a plume of CO vapor interior the snowline, increasing the
CO abundance by a factor ${\sim}2{-}6$ depending on the strength of the
turbulence and the sizes of the individual pebbles. The absence of this plume
of CO vapor in young nearby disks could indicate efficient conversion of CO
into a more refractory species, or a reduction in the radial mass flux of

improved? We answer this question affirmatively by designing a new algorithm
SALSA for streaming submodular maximization. It is the first low-memory,
single-pass algorithm that improves the factor $0.5$, under the natural
assumption that elements arrive in a random order. We also show that this
assumption is necessary, i.e., that there is no such algorithm with better than
$0.5$-approximation when elements arrive in arbitrary order. Our experiments
demonstrate that SALSA significantly outperforms the state of the art in
applications related to exemplar-based clustering, social graph analysis, and

study the performance of GLSE precoders in the large-system limit. We show that
the output symbols of these precoders are identically distributed and their

pure coherence from a single instance of a given resource state. Specifically,
we determine the distillable coherence with a given fidelity under incoherent

compared to the distillable coherence under maximal incoherent operations (MIO)
and dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO), which can be cast as a
semidefinite programme, that has been presented previously by Regula et al.
[PRL 121, 010401 (2018)]. Our results are given in terms of a smoothed
min-relative entropy distance from the incoherent set of states, and a variant
of the hypothesis-testing relative entropy distance, respectively. The one-shot
distillable coherence is also related to one-shot randomness extraction.
  Moreover, from the one-shot formulas under IO, MIO, DIO, we can recover the
optimal distillable rate in the many-copy asymptotics, yielding the relative
entropy of coherence. These results can be compared with previous work by some
of the present authors [Zhao et al., PRL 120, 070403 (2018)] on one-shot
coherence formation under IO, MIO, DIO and also SIO. This shows that the amount
of distillable coherence is essentially the same for IO, DIO, and MIO, despite

element (FE) computations of scalar-valued convection-diffusion equations with
non-constant and highly oscillatory coefficients. In the spirit of least
squares FE methods, the AVS-FE method recasts the governing second order
partial differential equation (PDE) into a system of first-order PDEs. However,
in the subsequent derivation of the equivalent weak formulation, a
Petrov-Galerkin technique is applied by using different regularities for the
trial and test function spaces. We use standard FE approximation spaces for the
trial spaces, which are C0, and broken Hilbert spaces for the test functions.
Thus, we seek to compute pointwise continuous solutions for both the primal
variable and its flux (as in least squares FE methods), while the test
functions are piecewise discontinuous. To ensure the numerical stability of the
subsequent FE discretizations, we apply the philosophy of the discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method by Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, by invoking test
functions that lead to unconditionally stable numerical systems (if the kernel
of the underlying differential operator is trivial). In the AVS-FE method, the
discontinuous test functions are ascertained per the DPG approach from local,
decoupled, and well-posed variational problems, which lead to best
approximation properties in terms of the energy norm. We present various 2D
numerical verifications, including convection-diffusion problems with highly
oscillatory coefficients and extremely high Peclet numbers, up to a billion.
These show the unconditional stability without the need for any upwind schemes
nor any other artificial numerical stabilization. The results are not highly
diffused for convection-dominated problems ...

directly detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB). Each of the technological
challenges described in [1,2] will be targeted and hopefully solved by the use
of the latest experimental developments and profiting from the low background
environment provided by the LNGS underground site. The first phase will focus
on the graphene technology for a tritium target and the demonstration of TES
microcalorimetry with an energy resolution of better than 0.05 eV for low
energy electrons. These technologies will be evaluated using the PTOLEMY
prototype, proposed for underground installation, using precision HV controls
to step down the kinematic energy of endpoint electrons to match the
calorimeter dynamic range and rate capabilities. The second phase will produce
a novel implementation of the EM filter that is scalable to the full target
size and which demonstrates intrinsic triggering capability for selecting
endpoint electrons. Concurrent with the CNB program, we plan to exploit and
develop the unique properties of graphene to implement an intermediate program
for direct directional detection of MeV dark matter [3,4]. This program will
evaluate the radio-purity and scalability of the graphene fabrication process
with the goal of using recently identified ultra-high radio-purity CO2 sources.
The direct detection of the CNB is a snapshot of early universe dynamics
recorded by the thermal relic neutrino yield taken at a time that predates the
epochs of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background and the
recession of galaxies (Hubble Expansion). Big Bang neutrinos are believed to
have a central role in the evolution of the Universe and a direct measurement
with PTOLEMY will unequivocally establish the extent to which these predictions
match present-day neutrino densities.

  Wireless Transmission",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In secure precise directional modulation (DM) networks, two practical
random-subcarrier-selection (RSS) methods are proposed to transmit confidential
message to the desired user per orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) symbol with only single receive power peak formed by constructing random
subcarrier set and performing a randomization procedure. This scheme completely
addresses the crucial problem facing secure precise wireless transmission
(SPWT), how to achieve the SPWT per OFDM symbol while the traditional SPWT
holds only in statistically average sense. Several necessary conditions for
SPWT per OFDM is derived and proposed: randomly distributed, sparse, and
distinct subcarrier distance between two pair of adjacent antennas. Two random
subcarrier sets (RSSs), quadratic subcarrier set (QSS) and prime subcarrier set
(PSS), are constructed, where the former means the subcarrier index associated
with any antennas is the square of antenna index, and the latter implies that
the subcarrier indices over all antennas are prime numbers. Subsequently,
following those conditions for SPWT per OFDM, a random factor is defined, and a
randomization procedure (RP) is proposed. Its detailed process includes the
following steps: integer mod, ordering, blocking, and block interleaving where
BI is repeated until the random factor is greater than the predefined
threshold. This yields a single main receive energy peak (SMREP) at the desired
position with other positions, outside the SMREP, harvesting only weak receive
energy seriously corrupted by AN.

keV X-rays and discovered pulsed emission with a broad sinusoidal pulse,
lagging the radio main pulse by 0.208 $\pm$ 0.012 in phase, with high pulsed
fraction of 70$-$80%. During the Q mode PSR B0823+26 was not detected in X-rays
(2 $\sigma$ upper limit a factor ~9 below the B-mode flux). The total X-ray
spectrum, pulse profile and pulsed fraction can globally be reproduced with a
magnetized partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere model with three emission
components: a primary small hot spot ($T$$\sim$3.6$\times10^6$ K, $R$$\sim$17
m), a larger cooler concentric ring ($T$$\sim$1.1$\times10^6$ K, $R$$\sim$280

the angle between the rotation axis and line of sight direction $\sim66^\circ$.
The latter is in conflict with the radio derived value of $(84\pm0.7)^\circ$.
The average X-ray flux within hours-long B-mode intervals varied by a factor
$\pm$20%, possibly correlated with variations in the frequency and lengths of
short radio nulls or short durations of weak emission. The correlated

changepoints, is important for many applications. However, many procedures rely
on the estimation of nuisance parameters (like long-run variance). Under the
alternative (a change in mean), estimators might be biased and data-adaptive
rules for the choice of tuning parameters might not work as expected. If the
data is not stationary, but heteroscedastic, this becomes more challenging. The
aim of this paper is to present and investigate two changepoint tests, which
involve neither nuisance nor tuning parameters. This is achieved by combing
self-normalization and wild bootstrap. We study the asymptotic behavior and
show the consistency of the bootstrap under the hypothesis as well as under the
alternative, assuming mild conditions on the weak dependence of the time series
and allowing the variance to change over time. As a by-product of the proposed
tests, a changepoint estimator is introduced and its consistency is proved. The
results are illustrated through a simulation study, which demonstrates
computational efficiency of the developed methods. The new tests will also be
applied to real data examples from finance and hydrology.

Specifically, we analyze the problem of choosing delegations to approximately

layers having residual and time delayed connections. The residual connection
paves way to construct deeper networks by enabling unhindered flow of gradients
and the time delay units capture temporal information with shared weights. The
number of layers in RMN signifies both the hierarchical processing depth and
temporal depth. The computational complexity in training RMN is significantly
less when compared to deep recurrent networks. RMN is further extended as
bi-directional RMN (BRMN) to capture both past and future information.
Experimental analysis is done on AMI corpus to substantiate the capability of
RMN in learning long-term information and hierarchical information. Recognition
performance of RMN trained with 300 hours of Switchboard corpus is compared
with various state-of-the-art LVCSR systems. The results indicate that RMN and

to increase both in recent Magnetospheric Multiple-Scale (MMS) observations as

regimes where either the parallel component, $E_{||}J_{||}$, or the

observations toward the protoplanetary disk around the solar analogue GM Aur.
Both images clearly resolve the $\sim$35 au inner cavity. The ALMA observations
also reveal a fainter disk that extends up to $\sim250$ au. We model our
observations using two approaches: an analytical fit to the observed
deprojected visibilities, and a physical disk model that fits the SED as well
as the VLA and ALMA observations. Despite not being evident in the deconvolved
images, the VLA and ALMA visibilities can only be fitted with two bright rings
of radii $\sim$40 and $\sim$80 au. Our physical model indicates that this
morphology is the result of an accumulation or trapping of large dust grains,
probably due to the presence of two pressure bumps in the disk. Even though
alternative mechanisms cannot be discarded, the multiple rings suggest that
forming planets may have cleared at least two gaps in the disk. Finally, our
analysis suggests that the inner cavity might display different sizes at 0.9 mm
and 7 mm. This discrepancy could be caused by the presence of free-free
emission close to the star at 7 mm, or by a more compact accumulation of the
large dust grains at the edge of the cavity.

problems in linear elasticity. The adaptive process involves generating a
sequence of surrogate models defined on a partition of the solution domain into

thin films with rare earth ions, which, owing to their large magnetic moments,
promise commensurately large magnetic gap openings in the topological surface
states. However, only when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which persists up to
room-temperature. Although disorder alone could be ruled out as a cause of the

electronic properties of Dy:Bi2Te3 remained elusive. Here, we present an X-ray
magnetic circular dichroism, polarized neutron reflectometry, muon spin
rotation, and resonant photoemission study of the microscopic magnetic and
electronic properties. We find that the films are not simply paramagnetic but
that instead the observed behavior can be well explained by the assumption of
slowly fluctuating, inhomogeneous magnetic patches with increasing volume
fraction as the temperature decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large
effective magnetization can be easily introduced by the application of moderate
magnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for proximity
coupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a heterostructure with
transition metal-doped layers. However, the introduction of some charge
carriers by the dopants cannot be excluded at least in these highly doped
samples. Nevertheless, we find that the magnetic order is not mediated via the
conduction channel in these rare earth doped samples and therefore magnetic
order and carrier concentration are expected to be independently controllable.
This is not generally the case for transition metal doped topological

quasi-static approximation, we derive the equation which governs the evolution
of matter density perturbations, and it is shown that the effective
gravitational coupling 'constant' acquires an additional contribution due to
the non-minimal matter-torsion coupling term. In this way, this result
generalizes those previously obtained for the growth of matter overdensities in
the case of minimal $f(T)$ gravity. In order to get a feeling of our results we
apply them to the important case of a power-law coupling function, which we
assume to be the responsible for the late-time accelerated expansion in the
dark energy regime. Thereby, analytic solutions for the matter density
perturbation equation in the regime of dark matter dominance and the dark
energy epoch are obtained, along with a complete numerical integration of this
equation. In particular, we show that this model predicts a growth index larger
than those obtained for $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating therefore a smaller
growth rate. Concomitantly, we show that the model at hand is potentially
capable in alleviating the existing $\sigma_{8}$-tension, being that it can

OPTSTREAM is a 4-step procedure consisting of sampling, perturbation,

perturbation module adds noise to the sampled data points to guarantee privacy.
Next, the reconstruction module reassembles non-sampled data points from the

private answers of additional queries on the data stream, to improve accuracy
by redistributing the added noise. OPTSTREAM is evaluated on a test case

for computer-based diagnosis and prognosis to facilitate the automation of
medical decision support and help clinicians identify cognitively intact
subjects that are at high-risk of developing AD. As a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder, researchers investigated how AD affects the brain
using different approaches: 1) image-based methods where mainly neuroimaging
modalities are used to provide early AD biomarkers, and 2) network-based
methods which focus on functional and structural brain connectivities to give
insights into how AD alters brain wiring. In this study, we reviewed
neuroimaging-based technical methods developed for AD and mild-cognitive
impairment (MCI) classification and prediction tasks, selected by screening all

discriminative or altered brain regions and connections. However, very few
works aimed to predict MCI progression based on early neuroimaging-based
observations. Despite the high importance of reliably identifying which early
MCI patient will convert to AD, remain stable or reverse to normal over

mathematical study of the Cauchy problem for the system. Our proof uses the
concentration compactness/rigidity road map of Kenig and Merle together with
the long-time Strichartz estimate approach of Dodson. Due to the failure of the
endpoint $L_{t}^{2}L_{x}^{\infty}$ Strichartz estimate, we rely heavily on
bilinear Strichartz estimates. We overcome the obstruction to applying such
estimates caused by the lack of permutation invariance of the eeDS nonlinearity
under frequency decomposition by introducing a new frequency cube decomposition
of the nonlinearity and proving bilinear estimates suited to this

the 230 GHz flux from VLBI measurements. We report on disk thermodynamics at
these accretion rates ($\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}} \sim 10^{-5}$). The disk

cooling of electrons is not negligible, especially for $r \lesssim 10 GM/c^2$.
The Compton $y$ parameter is of order unity. We then compare derived and

often measure signals whose phase is missing or has been irremediably
distorted. Phase retrieval attempts to recover the phase information of a
signal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform to enable the reconstruction
of the original signal. Solving the phase retrieval problem is equivalent to
recovering a signal from its auto-correlation function. In this paper, we
assume the original signal to be sparse; this is a natural assumption in many
applications, such as X-ray crystallography, speckle imaging and blind channel
estimation. We propose an algorithm that resolves the phase retrieval problem
in three stages: i) we leverage the finite rate of innovation sampling theory
to super-resolve the auto-correlation function from a limited number of
samples, ii) we design a greedy algorithm that identifies the locations of a
sparse solution given the super-resolved auto-correlation function, iii) we
recover the amplitudes of the atoms given their locations and the measured
auto-correlation function. Unlike traditional approaches that recover a
discrete approximation of the underlying signal, our algorithm estimates the
signal on a continuous domain, which makes it the first of its kind.
  Along with the algorithm, we derive its performance bound with a theoretical
analysis and propose a set of enhancements to improve its computational
complexity and noise resilience. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of the
proposed method via a comparison against Charge Flipping, a notable algorithm
in crystallography.

characterize the optimal solutions and show they can be written in terms of

solving the semi-discrete unbalanced transport problem numerically. As an
application we study the unbalanced quantization problem, where one looks for
the best approximation of a diffuse measure by a discrete measure with respect

two dimensions -- optimality of the triangular lattice -- and compute the

focused on uncovering the technology characters and challenges, this study
mainly evaluated the effectiveness of training using traditional tools and
computer-aided technologies on the well-being of individuals. Measures of the
effectiveness included knowledge acquisition, unsafe behaviour alteration, and
injury rate reduction. Results indicated that: 1. the effectiveness of
traditional tools is sufficiently supported by statistical evidence; and 2. the
use of computer-aided technologies has evidence to support its effectiveness,
but more solid evidence is required to support this statement. It was also
found that the overall performance of computer-aided technologies is superior
in several technical aspects compared to traditional tools, namely,
representing actual workplace situations, providing text-free interfaces,
having better user engagement, and being more cost-efficient. Finally, using
the systematic review findings, a theoretical framework is proposed as a
potential solution to help future research in this field systematically examine
the effectiveness and usability of their approaches. This framework is
theoretical in nature and requires further validation. A further study is
therefore proposed to test and validate this framework.

is to measure it directly from the profile curve of a sessile drop, a method
with certain inherent drawbacks. Here we describe an alternative method that
uses the height and volume of a sessile drop as constraints to construct its
profile by numerical integration of its two governing differential equations.
The integration yields, self consistently, the average value of the contact
angle along the entire contact line as well as the footprint radius of the drop
and its crown radius of curvature. As a test case, the new method is used to
obtain the contact angle of pure water on two different substrates, Teflon and
Lucite. For each substrate, four drops ranging in volume from 10 {\mu}l to 40
{\mu}l are used. The computed contact angles are consistent across the four
different drop sizes for each substrate and are in agreement with typical
literature values.

by the fact that power system supplies power to a vast number of loads and is
fed from many generating units. As loads vary, reactive power requirements of
the transmission system vary. Moreover, voltage magnitude is relatively less
sensitive to active power compared to reactive power due to high X/R ratio of
transmission lines. Therefore, separating voltage control from active power is
not only justified but also the common and practical way in power transmission
systems. Considering these facts, the fast decoupled power flow jacobian can be
used to control voltage magnitudes by reactive power compensation. In this
paper, an optimal voltage control is presented to obtain new voltage set-points
for PV buses by maximizing the effect of input change on output change using
the Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF) jacobian matrix. The proposed algorithm was
tested on three IEEE systems: 9 bus, 14 bus and 30 bus systems.

When placed in a Fourier plane, the SLM permits modulation of the microscope's
light-sheet to implement imaging techniques such as structured illumination,
tiling, pivoting, autofocusing and pencil beam scanning. Previous publications
on dedicated microscope setups have shown how these techniques can deliver
improved image quality by rejecting out-offocus light (structured illumination

obtaining a more uniform illumination by moving the highest-resolution region

these techniques to be employed on one optical setup compatible with the
OpenSPIM design. It also offers the possibility to choose between three
different light-sheets, in thickness and height, which can be selected

  Microstructure",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  An assumption in micromechanical analysis of polymers is that the
constitutive polymeric media is non-porous. Non-porosity of media, however, is
merely a simplifying assumption. In this paper, we neglect this assumption and
studied polymer networks with a different porosity volume fraction. A random
morphology description function is used to model the porosity of the network
and nonlinear finite element analyses are conducted to perform structural
analysis of porous polymer networks. The results show that the porosity effect
is significant in mechanical behavior of polymer networks and may increase the
maximum Von-Mises stress drastically.

  (3+1)-dimensional generalized shallow water wave equation","26 pages, 51 figures",,,,"nlin.PS math-ph math.MP nlin.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many important physical situations such as fluid flows, marine environment,
solid-state physics and plasma physics have been represented by shallow water
wave equation. In this article, we construct new solitary wave solutions for
the (3+1)-dimensional generalized shallow water wave (GSWW) equation by using
Lie symmetry method. A variety of analytic (closed-form) solutions such as new
periodic solitary wave, cross-kink soliton and doubly periodic breather-type
solutions have been obtained by using invariance of the concerned
(3+1)-dimensional GSWW equation under one-parameter Lie group of
transformations. Lie symmetry transformations have applied to generate the
different forms of invariant solutions of the (3+1)-dimensional GSWW equation.
For different Lie algebra, Lie symmetry method reduces (3+1)-dimensional GSWW
equation into various ordinary differential equations (ODEs) while one of the
Lie algebra, it is transformed into the well known (2+1)-dimensional BLMP
equation. It is affirmed that the proposed techniques are convenient, genuine
and powerful tools to find the exact solutions of nonlinear partial
differential equations (PDEs). Under the suitable choices of arbitrary
functions and parameters, 2D, 3D and contour graphics to the obtained results
of GSWW equation are also analyzed graphically.

graphene/Si hybrid waveguides with enhanced self-phase modulation. In the case
of CMOS compatible materials for nonlinear optical signal processing, Si and
silicon nitride waveguides have been extensively investigated over the past
decade. However, Si waveguides exhibit strong two-photon absorption (TPA) at
telecommunication wavelengths, which lead to a significant reduction of
nonlinear figure of merit. In contrast, silicon nitride based material system
usually suppress the TPA, but simultaneously leads to the reduction of the Kerr
nonlinearity by two orders of magnitude. Here, we introduce a graphene/Si
hybrid waveguide, which remain the optical properties and CMOS compatibility of
Si waveguides, while enhance the Kerr nonlinearity by transferring patterned
graphene over the top of the waveguides. The graphene/Si waveguides are
measured with a nonlinear parameter of 510 W-1m-1. Enhanced nonlinear
figure-of-merit (FOM) of 2.48 has been achieved, which is three times higher
than that of the Si waveguide. This work reveals the potential application of
graphene/Si hybrid photonic waveguides with high Kerr nonlinearity and FOM for
nonlinear all-optical signal processing.

  modelling",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Texture is an important attribute in the quality assessment of processed food
products. Youngs modulus is an indirect measure of texture. During thermal
treatment of hygroscopic foods, parameters such as moisture content
significantly affect Youngs modulus. However, the sensitivity to these
parameters has not yet been quantified in terms of the stress strain behaviour.
We have built an experimentally validated model to address this gap. This paper
presents the stress strain behaviour and its sensitivity towards various
parameters. Experiments are conducted with potato samples for stress strain
behaviour, parametric sensitivity analysis, estimation of initial and critical
values of moisture content and Youngs modulus. We found that the Youngs modulus
and the ultimate strength vary by as much as 54 percent and 29 percent
depending on the rate of applied strain, indicating the need for test
standards. Further, we propose a model to predict the local Youngs moduli as a
function of moisture content, and a relationship between these and the
effective Youngs modulus. While model results agree well for drying, they
deviate by as much as 16 percent from experiments for frying, indicating the
necessity of incorporating additional physics. We expect this work to serve as
a crucial step towards the physics based prediction modelling of local and
effective Youngs moduli during thermal processing of food products.
