recovery by using realistic simulations based on the seven-frequency Planck

with pointers from declarative specifications expressed in Separation Logic.
Our synthesis algorithm takes as input a pair of assertions---a pre- and a
postcondition---which describe two states of the symbolic heap, and derives a
program that transforms one state into the other, guided by the shape of the
heap. The program synthesis algorithm rests on the novel framework of Synthetic
Separation Logic (SSL), which generalises the classical notion of heap
entailment $\mathcal{P} \vdash \mathcal{Q}$ to incorporate a possibility of
transforming a heap satisfying an assertion $\mathcal{P}$ into a heap
satisfying an assertion $\mathcal{Q}$. A synthesized program represents a proof
term for a transforming entailment statement $\mathcal{P} \leadsto
\mathcal{Q}$, and the synthesis procedure corresponds to a proof search. The
derived programs are, thus, correct by construction, in the sense that they
satisfy the ascribed pre/postconditions, and are accompanied by complete proof
derivations, which can be checked independently.
  We have implemented a proof search engine for SSL in a form the program
synthesizer called SuSLik. For efficiency, the engine exploits properties of
SSL rules, such as invertibility and commutativity of rule applications on
separate heaps, to prune the space of derivations it has to consider. We
explain and showcase the use of SSL on characteristic examples, describe the
design of SuSLik, and report on our experience of using it to synthesize a
series of benchmark programs manipulating heap-based linked data structures.

Moreover, most of these scheduling schemes seek either fully centralized
approaches having overhead of communicating to a central entity or fully
distributed approaches requiring changes in the fabric. Motivated by these
shortcomings, we present HyLine a simple scheduling design for commodity DCNs
which is equipped with a joint load-balancing and flow scheduling (path-aware)
design exploiting the multipath nature of DCNs. HyLine takes a hybrid approach
and uses the global-awareness of centralized and agility of distributed
techniques without requiring any changes in the fabric. To that end, it
determines a threshold margin identifying flows for which using centralized

been addressed: First, how to construct a robust representation that easily
captures the spatial-temporal evolutions of motions from skeleton sequences.
Second, how to design D-CNNs capable of learning discriminative features from
the new representation in a effective manner. To address these tasks, a
skeletonbased representation, namely, SPMF (Skeleton Pose-Motion Feature) is
proposed. The SPMFs are built from two of the most important properties of a
human action: postures and their motions. Therefore, they are able to
effectively represent complex actions. For learning and recognition tasks, we
design and optimize new D-CNNs based on the idea of Inception Residual networks
to predict actions from SPMFs. Our method is evaluated on two challenging
datasets including MSR Action3D and NTU-RGB+D. Experimental results indicated
that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods whilst requiring
less computation.

  Random Demand",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the classic stochastic (dynamic) knapsack problem,
a fundamental mathematical model in revenue management, with general
time-varying random demand. Our main goal is to study the optimal policies,
which can be obtained by solving the dynamic programming formulated for the
problem, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is well-known that when the
demand size is fixed and the demand distribution is stationary over time, the
value function of the dynamic programming exhibits extremely useful first and
second order monotonicity properties, which lead to monotonicity properties of
the optimal policies. In this paper, we are able to verify that these results
still hold even in the case that the price distributions are time-dependent.
When we further relax the demand size distribution assumptions and allow them
to be arbitrary, for example in random batches, we develop a scheme for using
value function of alternative unit demand systems to provide bounds to the
value function. These results confirm some of the basic understandings of the
stochastic knapsack problem. As a natural consequence, we propose a new class
of heuristic policies, two-dimensional switch-over policies, and discuss
numerical procedures for optimizing the parameters of the policies. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that these switch-over policies can provide
performances that are in a close neighborhood of the optimum statistically.

telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to

tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of
coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from off-axis
sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that
apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC
workshop agreed that it would benefit our community to clearly define
quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems.
Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical
designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may

detection significance of the given point source in the presence of realistic

convolution operation, which is translation invariant by design. However,
location in itself can be an important cue. For example, a salient object is
more likely to be closer to the center of the image, the sky in the top part of
an image, etc. To include the location cue for feature learning, we propose to
augment the color image, the usual input to CNNs, with one or more channels
that carry location information. We test two approaches for adding location
information. In the first approach, we incorporate location directly, by
including the row and column indexes as two additional channels to the input
image. In the second approach, we add location less directly by adding distance
transform from the center pixel as an additional channel to the input image. We
perform experiments with both direct and indirect ways to encode location. We
show the advantage of augmenting the standard color input with location related
channels on the tasks of salient object segmentation, semantic segmentation,

properties of the involution, such as hyperbolicity, and isotropy up to an

also provide examples of nonisomorphic involutions on an index $2$ algebra that
yield similar quadratic forms, thus proving that the form $q_\sigma$ does not
determine the isomorphism class of $\sigma$, even when the underlying algebra

already been considered in the literature. For inhomogeneous condensate flows

directly create phonons. This more direct interaction can be more efficient and

cost robots suffer from noisy labels due to imperfect execution and calibration
errors. To handle this, we develop a framework which factors out the noise as a
latent variable. Our model is trained on 28K grasps collected in several houses
under an array of different environmental conditions. We evaluate our models by
physically executing grasps on a collection of novel objects in multiple unseen
homes. The models trained with our home dataset showed a marked improvement of
43.7% over a baseline model trained with data collected in lab. Our
architecture which explicitly models the latent noise in the dataset also
performed 10% better than one that did not factor out the noise. We hope this

based on the same limiting concept. Second, we develop a positivity-preserving

hierarchical time steps, the local time stepping scheme dynamically adjusts the
time steps of all multi-resolution levels to maintain positivity. The method is
validated and its capabilities are demonstrated by a range of test cases.

functions involving a number of sites scaling like the system size follow
different rules. We quantify the long-range correlations through the von

the backflow instability in simulations of outflow/open boundary problems for

steps: (i) devise a general form of boundary conditions that ensure the energy
stability by re-formulating the boundary contribution into a quadratic form in
terms of a symmetric matrix and computing an associated eigen problem; and (ii)
require that, upon imposing the boundary conditions from the previous step, the
scale of boundary dissipation should match a physical scale. These open
boundary conditions can be re-cast into the form of a traction-type condition,
and therefore they can be implemented numerically using the splitting-type
algorithm from a previous work. The current boundary conditions can effectively
overcome the backflow instability typically encountered at moderate and high
Reynolds numbers. These boundary conditions in general give rise to a non-zero
traction on the entire open boundary, unlike previous related methods which
only take effect in the backflow regions of the boundary. Extensive numerical
experiments in two and three dimensions are presented to test the effectiveness
and performance of the presented methods, and simulation results are compared

compatible with demonstrably realistic prebiotic chemistries: synthesis of
dilute mixtures of racemic amino acids from atmospheric gases, and
polymerization of unactivated amino acids on hot, intermittently-wetted
surfaces. Starting from a peptide/IMT-based genetics, plausible processes could
support the elaboration of genetic and metabolic complexity in an early-Earth

the galaxy obeys a standard stellar-halo mass relation are in tension with the

of quenching. We detect a powerful molecular outflow that shows a positive
velocity gradient and extends for at least ~10 kpc from the nuclear region,
about three times the projected size of the ionized wind. The molecular gas in
the outflow does not reach velocities high enough to escape the galaxy and is
therefore expected to be reaccreted. Keeping in mind the various assumptions

are dominated by the molecular phase. The AGN-driven outflow in zC400528 is
powerful enough to deplete the molecular gas reservoir on a timescale at least

quantum quench through a critical point in 1+1 dimensions. We begin with a toy
model consisting of a quantum harmonic oscillator, and show that complexity
exhibits universal scalings in both the slow and fast quench regimes. We then
generalize our results to a 1-dimensional harmonic chain, and show that
preservation of these scaling behaviours in free field theory depends on the
choice of norm. Applying our set-up to the case of two oscillators, we quantify
the complexity of purification associated to a subregion, and demonstrate that
complexity is capable of probing features to which the entanglement entropy is
insensitive. We find that the complexity of subregions is subadditive, and
comment on potential implications for holography.

bispectrum in redshift space, $B$, contains additional cosmological information
with respect to the power spectrum, $P$. We focus on a $Euclid$-like survey and
consider cosmological models dominated by dark energy and cold dark matter with
Gaussian primordial perturbations. After discussing the phenomenology of
redshift-space distortions for the bispectrum, we derive an expression for the
cross-covariance between $B$ and $P$ at leading order in perturbation theory.
Our equation generalizes previous results that did not consider binning in the
orientation of wavevector triangles with respect to the line of sight. By
considering Fourier modes with wavenumber $k<0.15 \,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we find that
$B$ and $P$ set similar constraints on the cosmological parameters. Generally,
error bars moderately improve when the two probes are combined together. For
instance, the joint 68.3 per cent credible region for the parameters that
describe a dynamical dark-energy equation of state shrinks by a factor of 2.6
with respect to only using the power spectrum. Regrettably, this improvement is
cancelled out when the clustering analysis is combined with priors based on
current studies of the cosmic microwave background. In this case, combining $B$
and $P$ does not give any appreciable benefit other than allowing a precise
determination of galaxy bias. Finally, we discuss how results depend on the
binning strategy for the clustering statistics as well as on the maximum
wavenumber. We also show that only considering the bispectrum monopole leads to
a significant loss of information.

formally any CSP as sum of disjointed Simple Stellar Populations (SSP), with
the aim to offer a more general formal setting to cast the equations of stellar

to be object of dissipation processes thus developing its dynamics in a general
non-Hamiltonian framework. Furthermore, we investigate the necessary and

identical except for random minute initial displacements to particle positions

galaxy level (while the statistical properties of the ensemble of galaxies are
unchanged). After cosmological times, the global properties of pairs of
'shadow' galaxies that are matched between the simulations differ from each
other generally at a level of ~2-25%, depending on the considered physical
quantity. We perform these experiments using cosmological volumes of
(25-50Mpc/h)^3 evolved either purely with dark matter, or with baryons and
star-formation but no feedback, or using the full feedback model of the
IllustrisTNG project. The runs cover four resolution levels spanning a factor
of 512 in mass. We find that without feedback the differences between shadow
galaxies generally become smaller as the resolution increases, but with the
IllustrisTNG model the results are mostly converging towards a 'floor'. This
hints at the role of feedback in setting the chaotic properties of galaxy
formation. Importantly, we compare the macroscopic differences between shadow
galaxies to the overall scatter in various galaxy scaling relations, and
conclude that for the star formation-mass and the Tully-Fisher relations the
butterfly effect in our simulations contributes significantly to the overall
scatter. We find that our results are robust to whether random numbers are used

MFG to extend displacement convexity methods from to MFG. In particular, we
identify a class of functions, that depend on solutions of MFG, that are convex

remarkable consequence is the log-convexity of $L^q$ norms. This convexity

accurate estimate of the pre-infall halo mass, $M_{200}$, for satellite
galaxies. To achieve this, we abundance match with the mean star formation
rate, averaged over the time when a galaxy was forming stars, $\langle {\rm
SFR}\rangle$, instead of the stellar mass, $M_*$. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, the GAMA survey and the Bolshoi simulation, we obtain a
statistical $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}_{200}$ relation in $\Lambda{\rm
CDM}$. We then compare the pre-infall halo mass, $M^{\rm abund}_{200}$, derived
from this relation with the pre-infall dynamical mass, $M^{\rm dyn}_{200}$, for
21 nearby dSph and dIrr galaxies, finding a good agreement between the two. As
a first application, we use our new $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}_{200}$
relation to empirically measure the cumulative mass function of a
volume-complete sample of bright Milky Way satellites within 280 kpc of the
Galactic centre. Comparing this with a suite of cosmological 'zoom' simulations
of Milky Way-mass halos that account for subhalo depletion by the Milky Way
disc, we find no missing satellites problem above $M_{200} \sim 10^9\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ in the Milky Way. We discuss how this empirical method can be applied
to a larger sample of nearby spiral galaxies.

errors in predicting interaction energies. Herein we propose a simple,
transferable, and computationally-efficient model (MASTIFF) whereby
atomic-level orientation dependence can be incorporated into ab initio
intermolecular force fields. MASTIFF includes anisotropic exchange-repulsion,
charge penetration, and dispersion effects, in conjunction with a standard
treatment of anisotropic long-range (multipolar) electrostatics. To validate
our approach, we benchmark MASTIFF against various sum-of-spheres models over a
large library of intermolecular interactions between small organic molecules.
MASTIFF achieves quantitative accuracy with respect to both high-level
electronic structure theory and experiment, thus showing promise as a basis for
'next-generation' force field development.

period of the planet is close to the rotation period of the star (39$-$44.5 d)

matter interaction rates in Earth-based experiments as a result of the Earth's
motion in the halo. Observation of such features can provide generic evidence
for detection of dark matter interactions. This paper reports a search for both
annual and diurnal rate modulations in the LUX dark matter experiment using
over 20 calendar months of data acquired between 2013 and 2016. This search
focuses on electron recoil events at low energies, where leptophilic dark
matter interactions are expected to occur and where the DAMA experiment has
observed a strong rate modulation for over two decades. By using the innermost
volume of the LUX detector and developing robust cuts and corrections, we
obtained a stable event rate of 2.3$\pm$0.2~cpd/keV$_{\text{ee}}$/tonne, which
is among the lowest in all dark matter experiments. No statistically
significant annual modulation was observed in energy windows up to
26~keV$_{\text{ee}}$. Between 2 and 6~keV$_{\text{ee}}$, this analysis
demonstrates the most sensitive annual modulation search up to date, with
9.2$\sigma$ tension with the DAMA/LIBRA result. We also report no observation
of diurnal modulations above 0.2~cpd/keV$_{\text{ee}}$/tonne amplitude between
2 and 6~keV$_{\text{ee}}$.

increasing complexity. First, a general discussion of non-Abelian Hermite

weights is a solution of a Sylvester type Pearson equation with coefficients
first order matrix polynomials, is given. All these is applied to the
discussion of possible scenarios leading to eigenvalue problems for second

difference equations are discussed next. Firstly, for the general Hermite
situation a general non linear relation (non trivial because the non
commutativity features of the setting) for the recursion coefficients is
gotten.
  In the next case of higher difficulty, degree two polynomials are allowed in
the Pearson equation, but the discussion is simplified by considering only a
left Pearson equation. In the case, the support of the measure is on an
appropriate branch of an hyperbola. The recursion coefficients are shown to
fulfill a non-Abelian extension of the alternate discrete Painlev\'e I

depending on the end-to-end network conditions. Further, varying network
conditions can lead to the video client running out of playback content
resulting in rebuffering events. These factors affect the user satisfaction and
cause degradation of the user quality of experience (QoE). It is important to
quantify the perceptual QoE of the streaming video users and monitor the same
in a continuous manner so that the QoE degradation can be minimized. However,
the continuous evaluation of QoE is challenging as it is determined by complex
dynamic interactions among the QoE influencing factors. Towards this end, we
present LSTM-QoE, a recurrent neural network based QoE prediction model using a
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM-QoE is a network of cascaded
LSTM blocks to capture the nonlinearities and the complex temporal dependencies
involved in the time varying QoE. Based on an evaluation over several publicly

capability to model the QoE dynamics effectively. We compare the proposed model

measurement problem and the status of state-vector collapse. In a no-collapse
approach, measurement is typically modeled as a dynamical process involving
decoherence. We describe how the minimal modal interpretation closes a gap in
this dynamical description, leading to a complete and consistent resolution to
the measurement problem and an effective form of state collapse. Our
interpretation also provides insight into the indivisible nature of
measurement--the fact that you can't stop a measurement part-way through and
uncover the underlying `ontic' dynamics of the system in question. Having
discussed the hidden dynamics of a system's ontic state during measurement, we
turn to more general forms of open-system dynamics and explore the extent to
which the details of the underlying ontic behavior of a system can be
described. We construct a space of ontic trajectories and describe obstructions
to defining a probability measure on this space.

double-octupole or $\alpha$-cluster structure of the $0^+_2$ state in

direct detection of exoplanets requires unprecedented levels of wavefront

aberrations using the scientific camera as a wavefront sensor.
  Aims. In this paper, we develop an extension of coronagraphic phase diversity
to the estimation of the complex electric field, that is, the joint estimation
of phase and amplitude.
  Methods. We introduced the formalism for complex coronagraphic phase
diversity. We have demonstrated experimentally on the Tr\`es Haute Dynamique
testbed at the Observatoire de Paris that it is possible to reconstruct phase
and amplitude aberrations with a subnanometric precision using coronagraphic
phase diversity. Finally, we have performed the first comparison between the
complex wavefront estimated using coronagraphic phase diversity (which relies
on time-modulation of the speckle pattern) and the one reconstructed by the
self-coherent camera (which relies on the spatial modulation of the speckle
pattern).
  Results. We demonstrate that coronagraphic phase diversity retrieves complex
wavefront with subnanometric precision with a good agreement with the
reconstruction performed using the self-coherent camera.
  Conclusions. This result paves the way to coronagraphic phase diversity as a
coronagraphic wave-front sensor candidate for very high contrast space
missions.

graph into at least $k$ connected components. The minimum weight $k$-cut can be
computed in $O(n^{O(k)})$ time, but when $k$ is treated as part of the input,
computing the minimum weight $k$-cut is NP-Hard [Holdschmidt and Hochbaum
1994]. For $\operatorname{poly}(m,n,k)$-time algorithms, the best possible
approximation factor is essentially 2 under the small set expansion hypothesis
[Manurangsi 2017]. Saran and Vazirani [1995] showed that a $(2 -
2/k)$-approximately minimum weight $k$-cut can be computed by $O(k)$ minimum
cuts, which implies an $\tilde{O}(mk)$ randomized running time via the nearly
linear time randomized min-cut algorithm of Karger [2000]. Nagamochi and
Kamidoi [2007] showed that the minimum weight $k$-cut can be computed
deterministically in $O(mn + n^2 \log n)$ time. These results prompt two basic
questions. The first concerns the role of randomization. Is there a
deterministic algorithm for 2-approximate $k$-cuts matching the randomized
running time of $\tilde{O}(mk)$? The second question qualitatively compares
minimum cut to 2-approximate minimum $k$-cut. Can 2-approximate $k$-cuts be
computed as fast as the (exact) minimum cut - in $\tilde{O}(m)$ randomized
time?
  We make progress on these questions with a deterministic approximation
algorithm that computes $(2 + \epsilon)$-minimum $k$-cuts in $O(m \log^3(n) /

and challenging task in medical image analysis. While many advancements have
been made, there is room for continued improvements. One hurdle is that CT
images can exhibit high noise and low contrast, particularly in lower dosages.
To address this, we focus on a preprocessing method for CT images that uses
stacked generative adversarial networks (SGAN) approach. The first GAN reduces
the noise in the CT image and the second GAN generates a higher resolution
image with enhanced boundaries and high contrast. To make up for the absence of
high quality CT images, we detail how to synthesize a large number of low- and
high-quality natural images and use transfer learning with progressively larger
amounts of CT images. We apply both the classic GrabCut method and the modern
holistically nested network (HNN) to lesion segmentation, testing whether SGAN
can yield improved lesion segmentation. Experimental results on the DeepLesion
dataset demonstrate that the SGAN enhancements alone can push GrabCut
performance over HNN trained on original images. We also demonstrate that HNN +
SGAN performs best compared against four other enhancement methods, including
when using only a single GAN.

Some amenities, such as air quality, are measurable while others, such as the
prestige or the visual impression of a neighborhood, are difficult to quantify.
Despite the well-known impacts intangible housing features have on house
prices, limited attention has been given to systematically quantifying these
difficult to measure amenities. Two issues have led to this neglect. Not only
do few quantitative methods exist that can measure the urban environment, but
that the collection of such data is both costly and subjective.
  We show that street image and satellite image data can capture these urban
qualities and improve the estimation of house prices. We propose a pipeline
that uses a deep neural network model to automatically extract visual features
from images to estimate house prices in London, UK. We make use of traditional
housing features such as age, size, and accessibility as well as visual
features from Google Street View images and Bing aerial images in estimating
the house price model. We find encouraging results where learning to
characterize the urban quality of a neighborhood improves house price
prediction, even when generalizing to previously unseen London boroughs.
  We explore the use of non-linear vs. linear methods to fuse these cues with
conventional models of house pricing, and show how the interpretability of
linear models allows us to directly extract proxy variables for visual
desirability of neighborhoods that are both of interest in their own right, and
could be used as inputs to other econometric methods. This is particularly
valuable as once the network has been trained with the training data, it can be
applied elsewhere, allowing us to generate vivid dense maps of the visual

consistent with compact binaries in a quasi-circular inspiral prior to
coalescence, eccentric inspirals are also expected to occur in Nature. Due to
their complexity, we currently lack ready-to-use, analytic waveforms in the
Fourier domain valid for sufficiently high eccentricity, and such models are
crucial to coherently extract weak signals from the noise. We here take the
first steps to derive and properly validate an analytic waveform model in the
Fourier domain that is valid for inspirals of arbitrary orbital eccentricity.
As a proof-of-concept, we build this model to leading post-Newtonian order by
combining the stationary phase approximation, a truncated sum of harmonics, and
an analytic representation of hypergeometric functions. Through comparisons
with numerical post-Newtonian waveforms, we determine how many harmonics are
required for a faithful (matches above 99%) representation of the signal up to
orbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. As a first byproduct of this analysis,
we present a novel technique to maximize the match of eccentric signals over
time of coalescence and phase at coalescence. As a second byproduct, we
determine which of the different approximations we employ leads to the largest
loss in match, which could be used to systematically improve the model because
of our analytic control. The future extension of this model to higher
post-Newtonian order will allow for an accurate and fast phenomenological
hybrid that can account for arbitrary eccentricity inspirals and mergers.

automatically classify unlabelled SPEGs identified in the full data set. To aid

postinflationary universe was radiation dominated until it was about 47000
years old. Direct evidence for the radiation dominated epoch extends back until
nucleosynthesis, which began during the first second. However there are
theoretical reasons to prefer a period of earlier matter domination, prior to
nucleosynthesis, e.g. due to late decaying massive particles needed to explain
baryogenesis. Axion cosmology is quantitatively affected by an early period of
matter domination, with a different axion mass range preferred and greater
inhomogeneity produced on small scales. In this work we show that such
increased inhomogeneity can lead to the formation of axion miniclusters in
axion parameter ranges that are different from those usually assumed. If the
reheating temperature is below $58$ MeV, axion miniclusters can form even if
the axion field is present during inflation and has been previously
homogenized. The upper bound on the typical initial axion minicluster mass is
raised from $10^{-10} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{-7} M_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ is a
solar mass. These results may have consequences for indirect detection of axion
miniclusters, and could conceivably probe the thermal history of the universe
before nucleosynthesis.

short), the goal is to schedule transmissions of packets that arrive over time
in a network switch and need to be sent across a link. Each packet has a
deadline, representing its urgency, and a non-negative weight, that represents
its priority. Only one packet can be transmitted in any time slot, so if the
system is overloaded, some packets will inevitably miss their deadlines and be
dropped. In this scenario, the natural objective is to compute a transmission
schedule that maximizes the total weight of packets that are successfully
transmitted. The problem is inherently online, with the scheduling decisions
made without the knowledge of future packet arrivals. The central problem
concerning PacketSchD, that has been a subject of intensive study since 2001,
is to determine the optimal competitive ratio of online algorithms, namely the
worst-case ratio between the optimum total weight of a schedule (computed by an
offline algorithm) and the weight of a schedule computed by a (deterministic)
online algorithm.
  We solve this open problem by presenting a $\phi$-competitive online
algorithm for PacketSchD (where $\phi\approx 1.618$ is the golden ratio),
matching the previously established lower bound.

the ejecta mass (about 1E-4 solar masses) and filling factor (0.1<=f<=0.2) are
consistent with those of classical novae but larger (by at least an order of

mechanism is expected to dominate. I will also provide a critical discussion of

subject of both theoretical and practical interest since its introduction (by
Birk and Kol, 1998). In short, the problem can be defined as follows: there is
an input $\textbf{x} \triangleq (\textbf{x}_1, \dots, \textbf{x}_n)$, a set of
$n$ clients who each desire a single symbol $\textbf{x}_i$ of the input, and a
broadcaster whose goal is to send as few messages as possible to all clients so
that each one can recover its desired symbol. Additionally, each client has
some predetermined ""side information,"" corresponding to certain symbols of the
input $\textbf{x}$, which we represent as the ""side information graph""
$\mathcal{G}$. The graph $\mathcal{G}$ has a vertex $v_i$ for each client and a
directed edge $(v_i, v_j)$ indicating that client $i$ knows the $j$th symbol of
the input. Given a fixed side information graph $\mathcal{G}$, we are
interested in determining or approximating the ""broadcast rate"" of index coding
on the graph, i.e. the fewest number of messages the broadcaster can transmit
so that every client gets their desired information.
  Using index coding schemes based on linear programs (LPs), we take a
two-pronged approach to approximating the broadcast rate. First, extending
earlier work on planar graphs, we focus on approximating the broadcast rate for
special graph families such as graphs with small chromatic number and disk
graphs. In certain cases, we are able to show that simple LP-based schemes give
constant-factor approximations of the broadcast rate, which seem extremely
difficult to obtain in the general case. Second, we provide several LP-based
schemes for the general case which are not constant-factor approximations, but
which strictly improve on the prior best-known schemes.

galaxies. It includes 177 nearby merging dwarf galaxies of stellar mass M$_{*}$
$<$ 10$^{10}$M$_{\sun}$ and redshifts z $<$ 0.02. These galaxies are selected
by visual inspection of publicly available archival imaging from two wide-field
optical surveys (SDSS III and the Legacy Survey), and they possess low surface
brightness features that are likely the result of an interaction between dwarf
galaxies. We list UV and optical photometric data which we use to estimate
stellar masses and star formation rates. So far, the study of interacting dwarf
galaxies has largely been done on an individual basis, and lacks a sufficiently
large catalog to give statistics on the properties of interacting dwarf
galaxies, and their role in the evolution of low mass galaxies. We expect that
this public catalog can be used as a reference sample to investigate the
effects of the tidal interaction on the evolution of star-formation,
morphology/structure of dwarf galaxies.
  Our sample is overwhelmingly dominated by star-forming galaxies, and they are
generally found significantly below the red-sequence in the color-magnitude
relation. The number of early-type galaxies is only 3 out of 177. We classify
them, according to observed low surface brightness features, into various
categories including shells, stellar streams, loops, antennae or simply
interacting. We find that dwarf-dwarf interactions tend to prefer the low
density environment. Only 41 out of the 177 candidate dwarf-dwarf interaction
systems have giant neighbors within a sky projected distance of 700 kpc and a
line of sight radial velocity range $\pm$700 km/s and, compared to the LMC-SMC,
they are generally located at much larger sky-projected distances from their
nearest giant neighbor.

networks due to vast spectrum availability that could boost peak rate and

massive antenna array are required to meet link budget, but their power

designs based on hybrid digital and analog array architectures and the usage of
radio frequency (RF) signal processing via phase shifters have emerged as
potential solutions to improve energy efficiency and deliver performances close

state-of-the-art mmW massive antenna array designs and comparison among three
architectures, namely digital array, sub-array, and fully-connected hybrid
array. The comparison of performance, power, and area for these three
architectures is performed for three representative 5G use cases, which cover a
range of pre-beamforming SNR and multiplexing regimes. This is the first study
to comprehensively model and analyze all design aspects and criteria including:
1) optimal linear precoder, 2) impact of quantization error in DAC and phase
shifters, 3) RF signal distribution network, 4) power and area estimation based
on state-of-the-art mmW circuits including baseband precoding, digital signal

the most power and area efficient compared against optimal design for each

multiplexing. The analysis also reveals that sub-array is limited by reduced
beamforming gain due to array partitioning, and system bottleneck of the

account a matter perfect fluid. We derive the second-order action of scalar
perturbations and resulting linear perturbation equations of motion without
fixing any gauge conditions. Depending on physical problems at hand, most
convenient gauges can be chosen to study the development of inhomogeneities in
the presence of scalar and vector fields coupled to gravity. This versatile
framework, which encompasses Horndeski and generalized Proca theories as
special cases, is applicable to a wide variety of cosmological phenomena
including nonsingular cosmology, inflation, and dark energy. By deriving
conditions for the absence of ghost and Laplacian instabilities in several
different gauges, we show that, unlike Horndeski theories, it is possible to
evade no-go arguments for the absence of stable nonsingular bouncing/genesis
solutions in both generalized Proca and SVT theories. We also apply our
framework to the case in which scalar and vector fields are responsible for
dark energy and find that the separation of observables relevant to the
evolution of matter perturbations into tensor, vector, and scalar sectors is
transparent in the unitary gauge. Unlike the flat gauge chosen in the
literature, this result is convenient to confront SVT theories with

contacts to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, a rise of electron
temperature of the graphene under a current flow has not been seriously
considered in many applications. Owing to its small electronic heat capacity
and electron-phonon coupling, electron temperature of the graphene can be
increased easily by the application of current. The heat generated within the
graphene is transferred to the contacted 2D materials through the vdW interface
and potentially influences their properties. Here, we compare the
superconducting critical currents of an NbSe2 flake for two different methods
of current application: with a Au/Ti electrode fabricated by thermal
evaporation and with a graphene electrode contacted to the NbSe2 flake through
a vdW interface. The influence of the heat transfer from the graphene to NbSe2
is detected through the change of the superconductivity of NbSe2. We found that
the critical current of NbSe2 significantly reduces when the current is applied
with the graphene electrode compared to that from the conventional Au/Ti
electrode. Further, since the electron heating in graphene exhibits ambipolar
back-gate modulation, we demonstrate the electric field modulation of the
critical current in NbSe2 when the current is applied with graphene electrode.
These results are attributed to the significant heat transfer from the graphene
electrode to NbSe2 through vdW interface.

can be detected by classifiers trained on linguistic features extracted from
narrative transcripts. However, these linguistic features are impacted in a
similar but different fashion by the normal aging process. Aging is therefore a
confounding factor, whose effects have been hard for machine learning
classifiers (especially deep neural network based models) to ignore. We show
DNN models are capable of estimating ages based on linguistic features.
Predicting dementia based on this aging bias could lead to potentially
non-generalizable accuracies on clinical datasets, if not properly
deconfounded.
  In this paper, we propose to address this deconfounding problem with fair
representation learning. We build neural network classifiers that learn
low-dimensional representations reflecting the impacts of dementia yet
discarding the effects of age. To evaluate these classifiers, we specify a
model-agnostic score $\Delta_{eo}^{(N)}$ measuring how classifier results are
deconfounded from age. Our best models compromise accuracy by only 2.56\% and
1.54\% on two clinical datasets compared to DNNs, and their $\Delta_{eo}^{(2)}$
scores are better than statistical (residulization and inverse probability
weight) adjustments.

noise by varying the concentrations of O2 and CO that feed the vacuum chamber,
while the total flux stays constant. In addition to the regime of rare
transitions between states of different CO2 reaction rate induced by intrinsic
fluctuations, we found three distinct effects of external noise depending on
its strength: small noise suppresses transitions and stabilizes the upper rate
state; medium noise induces bursting; and large noise gives rise to reversible
transitions in both directions. To explain some of the features present in the
dynamics, we propose an extended stochastic model that includes a global
coupling through the gas phase to account for the removal of CO gas caused by
the adsorption of the Pd surface. The numerical simulations based in the model
show a qualitative agreement with the noise-induced transitions found in

for the IFT assumed. Since CACC strategies entail continuous information
broadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic
networks, leading to a platoon's IFT varying dynamically. To enhance the
performance of CACC strategies, this study proposes the idea of dynamically
optimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under CACC-OIFT,
the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles
will dynamically deactivate or activate the ""send"" functionality of their V2V
communication devices to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in
terms of string stability under the ambient traffic conditions. Given the
adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller with a
two-predecessor-following scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the
platoon size just before the start of a time period, the IFT optimization model
determines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability. The
optimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller
continuously determines the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on
the unfolding degeneration scenario for each time instant within that period.
The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through numerical
experiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the
proposed CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon
control in an unreliable V2V communication context, outperforming CACCs with
fixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for IFT dynamics.

by $P_{B}$ is always less than or at most equal to one for the local realistic
model ($P_{B}^{lc}\leq1$) regardless of the specific superposition coefficients
of entangled state. Including the non-local quantum interference the maximum
violation of BI is found as $P_{B}^{\max}$ $=2$, which, however depends on
state parameters and three measuring directions as well. Our result is suitable
for entangled photon pairs.

statistics for parameter estimation, by means of solving the system of
equations that match the population and estimated moments. However, in practice
and especially for the important case of mixture models, one frequently needs
to contend with the difficulties of non-existence or non-uniqueness of
statistically meaningful solutions, as well as the high computational cost of
solving large polynomial systems. Moreover, theoretical analysis of the method
of moments are mainly confined to asymptotic normality style of results
established under strong assumptions.
  This paper considers estimating a $k$-component Gaussian location mixture
with a common (possibly unknown) variance parameter. To overcome the
aforementioned theoretic and algorithmic hurdles, a crucial step is to denoise
the moment estimates by projecting to the truncated moment space (via
semidefinite programming) before solving the method of moments equations. Not
only does this regularization ensures existence and uniqueness of solutions, it
also yields fast solvers by means of Gauss quadrature. Furthermore, by proving
new moment comparison theorems in the Wasserstein distance via polynomial
interpolation and majorization techniques, we establish the statistical
guarantees and adaptive optimality of the proposed procedure, as well as oracle
inequality in misspecified models. These results can also be viewed as provable
algorithms for Generalized Method of Moments [Han82] which involves non-convex
optimization and lacks theoretical guarantees.

dielectric constant of the bulk dielectric. In dielectric theories, screening
is assigned to the surface charge appearing from preferential orientations of
dipoles along the local field in the interface. For liquid dielectrics, such
interfacial orientations are affected by the interfacial structure
characterized by a separate interfacial dielectric susceptibility. We argue
that dielectric properties of polar liquids should be characterized by two
distinct susceptibilities responsible for local response (solvation) and
long-range response (dielectric screening). We develop a microscopic model of
screening showing that the standard bulk dielectric constant is responsible for
screening at large distances. The potential of mean force between ions in polar
liquids becomes oscillatory at short distances. Oscillations arise from the
coupling of the collective longitudinal excitations of the dipoles in the bulk
with the interfacial structure of the liquid around the solutes.

supports the idea that the jet, expanding in a clumpy medium, plays a major

VLBI and ALMA observations. The HI observations reveal that, at least part of
the gas, is distributed in clouds with sizes up to a few tens of pc and mass
~10^4 Msun. A change of the conditions in the outflow, with an increasing
fraction of diffuse components, as the radio jets grow, is suggested by the

showing that the radio plasma jet can couple well with the ISM, strongly
affecting the kinematics, but also the physical conditions of the molecular

dissipative dynamics affecting Generalised Langevin Equations and the
Fluctuation Dissipation Relations. In the following work, we investigate some
aspects of nonlinear baths with rigour relying on perturbative expansions to

from such nonlinearities are addressed and the Markovian limit is explored;
super-Ohmic corrections to the linear Ohmic spectrum is deduced. Velocity
correlations of a probe system under such approximations are studied in detail.
In a second part to the paper, a quenched initial thermal bath is modelled via
nonlinearities and Louivillean evolution is applied to evaluate subsequent
correlations out of equilibrium. In all these problems, weak system-bath
coupling is assumed and quartic baths are used for specific calculations.

ASASSN-14dq exploded in a low-luminosity/metallicity host galaxy UGC 11860, the
signatures of which are present as weak iron lines in the photospheric phase
spectra. The SN has a plateau duration of $\sim\,$90 d, with a plateau decline
rate of 1.38 $\rm mag\ (100 d)^{-1}$ in V-band which is higher than most type
II-P SNe. ASASSN-14dq is a luminous type II-P SN with a peak $V$-band absolute
magnitude of -17.7$\,\pm\,$0.2 mag. The light curve of ASASSN-14dq indicates it
to be a fast-declining type II-P SN, making it a transitional event between the
type II-P and II-L SNe. The empirical relation between the steepness parameter
and $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass for type II SNe was rebuilt with the help of
well-sampled light curves from the literature. A $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass of
$\sim\,$0.029 M$_{\odot}$ was estimated for ASASSN-14dq, which is slightly
lower than the expected $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass for a luminous type II-P SN. Using
analytical light curve modelling, a progenitor radius of $\rm
\sim3.6\times10^{13}$ cm, an ejecta mass of $\rm \sim10\ M_{\odot}$ and a total
energy of $\rm \sim\,1.8\times 10^{51}$ ergs was estimated for this event. The
photospheric velocity evolution of ASASSN-14dq resembles a type II-P SN, but
the Balmer features (H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) show relatively slow velocity
evolution. The high-velocity H$\alpha$ feature in the plateau phase, the
asymmetric H$\alpha$ emission line profile in the nebular phase and the
inferred outburst parameters indicate an interaction of the SN ejecta with the
circumstellar material (CSM).

domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. Existing methods either
attempt to align the cross-domain distributions, or perform manifold subspace
learning. However, there are two significant challenges: (1) degenerated
feature transformation, which means that distribution alignment is often
performed in the original feature space, where feature distortions are hard to
overcome. On the other hand, subspace learning is not sufficient to reduce the
distribution divergence. (2) unevaluated distribution alignment, which means
that existing distribution alignment methods only align the marginal and
conditional distributions with equal importance, while they fail to evaluate
the different importance of these two distributions in real applications. In
this paper, we propose a Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment (MEDA)
approach to address these challenges. MEDA learns a domain-invariant classifier
in Grassmann manifold with structural risk minimization, while performing
dynamic distribution alignment to quantitatively account for the relative
importance of marginal and conditional distributions. To the best of our
knowledge, MEDA is the first attempt to perform dynamic distribution alignment
for manifold domain adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEDA
shows significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art traditional and deep methods.

are discussed: the phase transition of an ITO film from metallic to dielectric
state and the modification of a film surface under the action of UV light. To
exclude the latter option, we propose an improvement in the experimental scheme
by adding a graphene sheet on top of an ITO film. The formalism is developed
allowing precise calculation of the Casimir force between an Au sphere and a
graphene sheet on top of ITO film deposited on a quartz substrate. In doing so
Au, ITO, and quartz are described by the frequency-dependent dielectric
permittivities and real graphene sheet with nonzero mass-gap parameter and
chemical potential by the polarization tensor at nonzero temperature. Numerical
computations performed both before and after the phase transition resulting
from the UV treatment show that the presence of graphene leads to only a minor
decrease in the drop of the Casimir force which remains quite measurable. At
the same time, in the presence of graphene the guess that an observed drop
originates from the modification of an ITO surface by the UV light breaks down.
Similar results are obtained for the configuration of two parallel plates

phase-space dynamics is described by the Vlasov-Poisson equation. A key
characteristic is its infinite cumulant hierarchy, a tower of coupled evolution
equations for the cumulants of the phase-space distribution. While on large
scales the matter distribution is well described as a fluid and the hierarchy
can be truncated, smaller scales are in the multi-stream regime in which all
higher-order cumulants are sourced through nonlinear gravitational collapse.
This regime is crucial for the formation of bound structures and the emergence
of characteristic properties such as their density profiles. We present a novel
closure strategy for the cumulant hierarchy that is inspired by finitely
generated cumulants and hence beyond truncation. This constitutes a
constructive approach for reducing nonlinear phase-space dynamics of
Vlasov-Poisson to a closed system of equations in position space. Using this
idea, we derive Schr\""odinger-Poisson as approximate quantal method for solving
classical dynamics of Vlasov-Poisson with cold initial conditions. Our
deduction complements the common reverse inference of the Schr\""odinger-Vlasov

structure, which means searching for a family of modules, namely node subsets
spanning each a subnetwork more densely connected than the average. This work
proposes a novel type of objective function for graph clustering, in the form
of a multilinear polynomial whose coefficients are determined by network
topology. It may be thought of as a potential function, to be maximized, taking
its values on fuzzy clusterings or families of fuzzy subsets of nodes over
which every node distributes a unit membership. When suitably parametrized,
this potential is shown to attain its maximum when every node concentrates its
all unit membership on some module. The output thus is a partition, while the
original discrete optimization problem is turned into a continuous version
allowing to conceive alternative search strategies. The instance of the problem
being a pseudo-Boolean function assigning real-valued cluster scores to node
subsets, modularity maximization is employed to exemplify a so-called quadratic
form, in that the scores of singletons and pairs also fully determine the

function has degree 2. After considering further quadratic instances, different
from modularity and obtained by interpreting network topology in alternative

analytically compared with an existing greedy agglomerative procedure for the

several local searches with different initializations.

rich physics and game-changing applications of topological phases. As one
remarkable and recently discovered feature of Floquet symmetry protected
topological (SPT) phases, in principle a simple periodically driven system can
host an arbitrary number of topological protected zero edge modes and pi edge
modes, with Majorana zero modes and Majorana pi modes as examples protected by
the particle-hole symmetry. This work advocates a new route to holonomic
quantum computation by exploiting the co-existence of many Floquet SPT edge
modes, all of which have trivial dynamical phases during a computation
protocol. As compelling evidence supporting this ambitious goal, three pairs of
Majorana edge modes, hosted by a periodically driven one-dimensional (1D)
superconducting superlattice, are shown to suffice to encode two logical
qubits, realize quantum gate operations, and execute two simple quantum
algorithms through adiabatic lattice deformation. When compared with early
studies on quantum computation based on Majorana zero modes of topological
quantum wires, significant resource saving is now made possible by use of
Floquet SPT phases. This paper is thus hoped to motivate a series of future
studies on the potential of Floquet topological matter in quantum computation.

extensively employed to map semantic properties of words into a dense vector
representation. They capture semantic and syntactic relations among words but
the vectors corresponding to the words are only meaningful relative to each
other. Neither the vector nor its dimensions have any absolute, interpretable
meaning. We introduce an additive modification to the objective function of the
embedding learning algorithm that encourages the embedding vectors of words
that are semantically related to a predefined concept to take larger values
along a specified dimension, while leaving the original semantic learning
mechanism mostly unaffected. In other words, we align words that are already
determined to be related, along predefined concepts. Therefore, we impart
interpretability to the word embedding by assigning meaning to its vector
dimensions. The predefined concepts are derived from an external lexical
resource, which in this paper is chosen as Roget's Thesaurus. We observe that
alignment along the chosen concepts is not limited to words in the Thesaurus
and extends to other related words as well. We quantify the extent of
interpretability and assignment of meaning from our experimental results.
Manual human evaluation results have also been presented to further verify that
the proposed method increases interpretability. We also demonstrate the
preservation of semantic coherence of the resulting vector space by using
word-analogy and word-similarity tests. These tests show that the
interpretability-imparted word embeddings that are obtained by the proposed
framework do not sacrifice performances in common benchmark tests.

periods of activity and quiescence. In this work we investigate the duty cycle
of the radio galaxy B2~0258+35, which was previously suggested to be a
restarted radio galaxy based on its morphology. The radio source consists of a
pair of kpc-scale jets embedded in two large-scale lobes (~240 kpc) with
relaxed shape and very low surface brightness, which resemble remnants of a
past AGN activity. We have combined new LOFAR data at 145 MHz and new SRT data
at 6600 MHz with available WSRT data at 1400 MHz to investigate the spectral
properties of the outer lobes and derive their age. Interestingly, the spectrum
of both the outer Northern and Southern lobes is not ultra-steep as expected
for an old ageing plasma with spectral index values equal to $\rm
\alpha_{1400}^{145}=0.48\pm0.11$ and $\rm \alpha_{6600}^{1400}=0.69\pm0.20$ in
the outer Northern lobe, and $\rm \alpha_{1400}^{145}=0.73\pm0.07$ in the outer
Southern lobe. Moreover, despite the wide frequency coverage available for the
outer Northern lobe (145-6600~MHz), we do not identify a significant spectral
curvature (SPC$\simeq$0.2$\pm0.2$). While mechanisms such as in-situ particle
reacceleration, mixing or compression can temporarily play a role in preventing
the spectrum from steepening, in no case seem the outer lobes to be compatible
with being very old remnants of past activity as previously suggested (with age
$\gtrsim$ 80 Myr). We conclude that either the large-scale lobes are still
fuelled by the nuclear engine or the jets have switched off no more than a few
tens of Myr ago. Our study shows the importance of combining morphological and
spectral properties to reliably classify the evolutionary stage of low surface
brightness, diffuse emission that low frequency observations are revealing
around a growing number of radio sources.

instead at a close connection between the two gas components, possibly both

a clumpy outflow where the high and the low-ionization components are closely
linked. Changes in ionization over the years are mainly driven by the different
densities of the clumps crossing the observer's line-of-sight, in which the

multi-camera re-id approach. The proposed approach can accommodate human
operator inputs and provides early gains via a monotonic improvement in target
ranking. At the heart of our approach is a fusion function which operates on
deep feature representations of query and candidate matches. We formulate an
optimization procedure custom-designed to incrementally improve query
representation. Since existing evaluation methods cannot be directly adopted to
our setting, we also propose two novel evaluation protocols. The results on two
large-scale re-id datasets (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID) demonstrate that our
multi-camera method significantly outperforms baselines and other popular
feature fusion schemes. Additionally, we conduct a comparative subject-based
study of human operator performance. The superior operator performance enabled
by our approach makes a compelling case for its integration into deployable
video-surveillance systems.

that charge accumulation is decreased in the HTL/Perovskite interface, between

capacitance (Cel), resulting in an increase to recombination resistance (Rrec),

incident fields. To characterize an absorber, one needs to deal with the
coupling that may occur between different excitations. Energy Absorption
Interferometry (EAI) is a technique that highlights the independent degrees of
freedom through which a structure can absorb energy: the natural absorption
modes of the structure. The coupling between these modes vanishes. In this
paper, we use the EAI formalism to analyse different kinds of plasmonic
periodic absorbers while rigorously accounting for the coupling: resonant
golden patches on a grounded dielectric slab, parallel free-standing silver
wires and a silver slab of finite thickness. The EAI formalism is used to
identify the physical processes that mediate absorption in the near and far
field. First, we demonstrate that the angular absorption, which is classically
used to characterize periodic absorbers in the far field and which neglects the
coupling between different plane waves, is only valid under stringent
conditions (subwavelength periodicity, far field excitation and negligible
coupling between the two possible polarizations). Using EAI, we show how the
dominant absorption channels can be identified through the signature of the
absorption modes of the structure, while rigorously accounting for the
coupling. We then exploit these channels to improve absorption. We show that
long-range processes can be exploited to enhance the spatial selectivity, while
short-range processes can be exploited to improve absorptivity over wide angles
of incidence. Lastly, we show that simply adding scatterers with the proper
periodicity on top of the absorber, the absorption can be increased by more

morphologies can also be observed in vitro on model systems such as supported
membranes or lipid vesicles. Lipid mixtures separating in liquid-ordered and
liquid-disordered phases below a demixing temperature play a pivotal role in
this context. Protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions also contribute to
membrane shaping by promoting small domains or clusters. Such phase separations
displaying characteristic length-scales falling in-between the nanoscopic,
molecular scale on the one hand and the macroscopic scale on the other hand,
are named mesophases in soft condensed matter physics. In this review, we
propose a classification of the diverse mechanisms leading to mesophase
separation in biomembranes. We distinguish between mechanisms relying upon
equilibrium thermodynamics and those involving out-of-equilibrium mechanisms,
notably active membrane recycling. In equilibrium, we especially focus on the
many mechanisms that dwell on an up-down symmetry breaking between the upper
and lower bilayer leaflets. Symmetry breaking is an ubiquitous mechanism in
condensed matter physics at the heart of several important phenomena. In the
present case, it can be either spontaneous (domain buckling) or explicit, i.e.,
due to an external cause (global or local vesicle bending properties). Whenever
possible, theoretical predictions and simulation results are confronted to
experiments on model systems or living cells, which enables us to identify the
most realistic mechanisms from a biological perspective.

most precise tool for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). The Planck
temperature data tightly constrain the amplitude of local-type NG: $f_{\rm
NL}^{\rm loc} = 2.5 \pm 5.7$. Here, we compute previously-neglected foreground
biases in temperature-based $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ measurements, due to the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, gravitational lensing, the thermal and
kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and the cosmic infrared background. While
standard analyses already subtract a significant bias on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$
due to the ISW-lensing bispectrum, many other secondary anisotropy terms are
present in the temperature bispectrum. We compute the dominant biases on
$f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ arising from these signals. Most of the biases are
non-blackbody, and are thus reduced by multifrequency component separation
methods; however, recent analyses have found that extragalactic foregrounds are
present at non-negligible levels in the Planck component-separated maps.
Moreover, the Planck FFP8 simulations do not include the foreground
correlations that generate these biases. We compute the biases for individual
frequencies; some are comparable to the statistical error bar on $f_{\rm
NL}^{\rm loc}$, even for the main CMB channels (100, 143, and 217 GHz). For
future experiments, they greatly exceed the statistical error (considering
temperature only). Alternatively, the foreground contributions can be
marginalized over, but this leads to a non-negligible increase in the error bar
on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. A full assessment will require calculations in
tandem with component separation, ideally using simulations. We also compute
these biases for equilateral and orthogonal NG, finding large effects for the
latter. We conclude that the search for primordial NG using Planck data may not
yet be over.

constructed in terms of continued fractions that depend on the pair correlation
functions of the reservoir. By performing factorizations in the Kraus map a
perturbation theory is set up that conserves in arbitrary perturbative order
both positivity and probability of the density matrix. The latter is determined
by an integral equation for a bitemporal matrix and a finite hierarchy for
Kraus matrices. In lowest perturbative order this hierarchy reduces to one
equation for one Kraus matrix. Its solution is given by a continued fraction of
a much simpler structure as compared to the non-perturbative case. In lowest
perturbative order our non-Markovian evolution equations are applied to the

analysis to switch to logarithmic measures is inapplicable. Furthermore, in
contrast to the stock market prices which are only available for trading days,
EPEX prices cover the whole year, including weekends and holidays. Accordingly,
there is a lot of underlying variability in the data which has nothing to do
with volatility, but simply reflects diurnal activity patterns. An important
distinction of the present work is the application of matrix decomposition
techniques, namely the singular value decomposition (SVD), for defining an
alternative notion of volatility. This approach is systematically more robust
toward outliers and also the diurnal patterns. Our observations show that the

directly identify (in a certain way) those in $G$. It is well-known that we may

precisely, they are subgraphs of {\em $Z$-webs}. A $Z$-web is built from planar

face is a triangle which may contain an arbitrary graph. This characterization
yields an additional consequence for multiflow problems. Fix a graph $G$ and a
subset $Z \subseteq V(G)$ of terminals. Call $(G,Z)$ {\em cut-sufficient} if
the cut condition is sufficient to characterize the existence of a multiflow

preceded by a one-year increase of the total flux density by a factor of 2.5,
then it grew by a factor of 10 over ~0.4 years and declined by a factor of 8
during the consecutive 2.4 years. The peak maser luminosity was a factor of
24.5 higher than the pre-burst quiescent value. The light curves of individual
features showed considerable diversity but indicated a general trend of
suppression of the maser emission at blueshifted (<4.7 km s$^{-1}$) velocities
when the redshifted emission rapidly grew and new emission features appeared at
velocities >5.8 km s$^{-1}$. This new emission provided a contribution of about
80% to the maser luminosity around the peak of the burst. Conclusions: The
onset of the maser burst exactly coincides with that of the infrared burst
estimated from the motion of the light echo. This strongly supports the
radiative pumping scheme of the maser transition. The growth of the maser
luminosity is the result of an increasing volume of gas where the maser
inversion is achieved.

Accepted for publication in SIAM Discrete Math",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A well-studied geometric object in combinatorial optimization is the perfect
matching polytope of a graph $G$. In any investigation concerning the perfect
matching polytope, one may assume that $G$ is matching covered --- that is, it
is a connected graph (of order at least two) and each edge lies in some perfect
matching.
  A graph $G$ is Birkhoff-von Neumann (BvN) if its perfect matching polytope is
characterized solely by non-negativity and degree constraints. A result of
Balas (1981) implies that $G$ is BvN if and only if $G$ does not contain a pair
of vertex-disjoint odd cycles $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $G-V(C_1)-V(C_2)$ has a
perfect matching. It follows immediately that the corresponding decision
problem is in co-NP. However, it is not known to be in NP. The problem is in P
if the input graph is planar --- due to a result of Carvalho, Lucchesi and
Murty (2004). These authors, along with Kothari (2018), have shown that this
problem is equivalent to the seemingly unrelated problem of deciding whether a
given graph is $\overline{C_6}$-free.
  The combinatorial diameter of a polytope is the diameter of its $1$-skeleton
graph. A graph $G$ is PM-compact (PMc) if the combinatorial diameter of its
perfect matching polytope equals one. A result of Chv\'atal (1975) implies that
$G$ is PMc if and only if $G$ does not contain a pair of vertex-disjoint even
cycles $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $G-V(C_1)-V(C_2)$ has a perfect matching. Once
again the corresponding decision problem is in co-NP, but it is not known to be
in NP. The problem is in P if the input graph is bipartite or is near-bipartite
--- due to a result of Wang, Lin, Carvalho, Lucchesi, Sanjith and Little
(2013).
  In this paper, we consider the ""intersection"" of the aforementioned problems.
We give a complete characterization of matching covered graphs that are BvN as
well as PMc. (Thus the corresponding decision problem is in P.)

Traditionally this trait is classified using the OIV descriptor 227 (berry

phenotypic data. In the present study an objective, fast and sensor-based
approach was developed to monitor berry bloom. From the technical
point-of-view, it is known that the measurement of different illumination

Mobile Light-Separation-Lab is proposed in order to capture
illumination-separated images of grapevine berries for phenotyping the
distribution of epicuticular waxes (berry bloom). For image analysis, an
efficient convolutional neural network approach is used to derive the
uniformity and intactness of waxes on berries. Method validation over six
grapevine cultivars shows accuracies up to $97.3$%. In addition, electrical
impedance of the cuticle and its epicuticular waxes (described as an indicator
for the thickness of berry skin and its permeability) was correlated to the
detected proportion of waxes with $r=0.76$. This novel, fast and non-invasive

several advantageous features: it supports arbitrary approximation orders on
general meshes including polyhedral elements and non-matching interfaces; it is
inf-sup stable; it is locally conservative; it supports both the weak and
strong enforcement of velocity boundary conditions; it is amenable to efficient
computer implementations where a large subset of the unknowns is eliminated by
solving local problems inside each element. Particular care is devoted to the
design of the convective trilinear form, which mimicks at the discrete level
the non-dissipation property of the continuous one. The possibility to add a
convective stabilisation term is also contemplated, and a formulation covering
various classical options is discussed. The proposed method is theoretically
analysed, and an energy error estimate in $h^{k+1}$ (with $h$ denoting the
meshsize) is proved under the usual data smallness assumption. A thorough
numerical validation on two and three-dimensional test cases is provided both
to confirm the theoretical convergence rates and to assess the method in more

relationship between these 2 modalities for unpaired brain data. Yet its
usefulness for DIR was not assessed.
  In this study we evaluate the DIR performance for thoracic and abdominal

differentiate the two populations (e.g. inhale vs. exhale), are readily

relies on spatial correspondences being preserved between the real and the

this problem, we investigated reducing the spatial information provided to the

representation are abstracted and thus can be easily adapted to any model
fitting task on image data, independent of image modality or model. Several
ready-to-use libraries for model fitting and use-cases, including fit
evaluation and visualization, were implemented. Their embedding into MITK
allows for easy data loading, pre- and post-processing and thus a natural
inclusion of model fitting into an overarching workflow. As an example, we
present a comprehensive set of plug-ins for the analysis of DCE MRI data, which
we validated on existing and novel digital phantoms, yielding competitive
deviations between fit and ground truth. Providing a very flexible environment,
our software mainly addresses developers of medical imaging software that
includes model fitting algorithms and tools. Additionally, the framework is of
high interest to users in the domain of perfusion MRI, as it offers
feature-rich, freely available, validated tools to perform pharmacokinetic
analysis on DCE MRI data, with both interactive and automatized batch

extended to create colloidal joints, that - in analogy to their macroscopic
counterparts - can flexibly connect colloidal particles. These novel elements
enable the assembly of structures with internal degrees of flexibility, but
rely on previously unappreciated properties: the simultaneous fluidity of the
bilayer, lateral mobility of inserted (linker) molecules and colloidal
stability. Here we characterize every step in the manufacturing of CSLBs in
view of these requirements using confocal microscopy and fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP). Specifically, we have studied the influence of
different particle properties (roughness, surface charge, chemical composition,
polymer coating) on the quality and mobility of the supported bilayer. We find
that the insertion of lipopolymers in the bilayer can affect its homogeneity
and fluidity. We improve the colloidal stability by inserting lipopolymers or
double-stranded inert DNA into the bilayer. Finally, we include surface-mobile
DNA linkers and use FRAP to characterize their lateral mobility both in their
freely diffusive and bonded state. Our work offers a collection of experimental
tools for working with CSLBs in applications ranging from controlled bottom-up
self-assembly to model membrane studies.

combine our proposed aleatoric uncertainty with model uncertainty. Experiments
with segmentation of fetal brains and brain tumors from 2D and 3D Magnetic

by thermodynamic quantities, with entanglement entropy being a well-known
example. In this paper, we study a less well-known example, capacity of
entanglement, which is the quantum information theoretic counterpart of heat
capacity. It can be defined as the second cumulant of the entanglement spectrum
and can be loosely thought of as the variance in the entanglement entropy. We
review the definition of capacity of entanglement and its relation to various
other quantities such as fidelity susceptibility and Fisher information.
  We then calculate the capacity of entanglement for various quantum systems,
conformal and non-conformal quantum field theories in various dimensions, and
examine their holographic gravity duals. Resembling the relation between
response coefficients and order parameter fluctuations in Landau-Ginzburg
theories, the capacity of entanglement in field theory is related to integrated
gravity fluctuations in the bulk. We address the question of measurability, in
the context of proposals to measure entanglement and R\'enyi entropies by
relating them to $U(1)$ charges fluctuating in and out of a subregion, for
systems equivalent to non-interacting fermions.
  From our analysis, we find universal features in conformal field theories, in
particular the area dependence of the capacity of entanglement appears to track
that of the entanglement entropy. This relation is seen to be modified under
perturbations from conformal invariance. In quenched 1+1 dimensional CFTs, we
compute the rate of growth of the capacity of entanglement. The result may be
used to refine the interpretation of entanglement spreading being carried by
ballistic propagation of entangled quasiparticle pairs created at the quench.

forming regions are found to be clumpy in nature and show a hierarchical

techniques of some previous papers by the authors showing that some very useful
phenomenological properties which can be observed to the nano-scale can be
simulated and justified mathematically by means of some homogenization
processes when a certain critical scale is used in the corresponding framework.
Here the motivating problem in consideration is formulated in the context of
the reverse osmosis. We consider, on a part of the boundary of a domain
$\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$, a set of very small periodically distributed
semipermeable membranes having an ideal infinite permeability coefficient
(which leads to Signorini type boundary conditions) on a part $\Gamma_1$ of the
boundary. We also assume that a possible chemical reaction may take place on
the membranes. We obtain the rigorous convergence of the problems to a
homogenized problem in which there is a change in the constitutive
nonlinearities. Changes of this type are the reason for the big success of the
nanocomposite materials. Our proof is carried out for membranes not necessarily
of radially symmetric shape. The definition of the associated critical scale
depends on the dimension of the space (and it is quite peculiar for the special
case of $n=2$). Roughly speaking, our result proves that the consideration of
the critical case of the scale leads to an homogenized formulation which is
equivalent to have a global semipermeable membrane, at the whole part of the
boundary $\Gamma_1$, with a ""finite permeability coefficient of this virtual
membrane"" which is the best we can get, even if the original problem involves a
set of membranes of any arbitrary finite permeability coefficients.

measured and calculated features of HFA events were compared with the results

2003, the solar wind speed was higher than the average. Here we checked whether
the higher solar wind speed is a real condition of HFA formation also in 2006

filaments in motility assays - show a large variety of motility-induced
collective behaviors, such as aggregation, clustering and phase separation. The
behavior of dense suspensions of phoretic particles and of bacteria during
biofilm formation is determined by two principle physical mechanisms: (i)
volume exclusion (short-range steric repulsion) and (ii) quorum sensing
(longer-range reduced propulsion due to alteration of the local chemical
environment). To systematically characterize such systems, we study
semi-penetrable self-propelled rods in two dimensions, with a propulsion force
that decreases with increasing local rod density, by employing Brownian
Dynamics simulations. Volume exclusion and quorum sensing both lead to phase
separation, however, the structure and rod dynamics vastly differ. Quorum
sensing enhances the polarity of the clusters, induces perpendicularity of rods
at the cluster borders, and enhances cluster formation. For systems, where the
rods essentially become passive at high densities, formation of asters and
stripes is observed. Systems of rods with larger aspect ratios show more
ordered structures compared to those with smaller aspect ratios, due to their
stronger alignment, with almost circular asters for strongly density-dependent
propulsion force. With increasing range of the quorum-sensing interaction, the
local density decreases, asters become less stable, and polar hedgehog clusters
and clusters with domains appear. Our results characterize structure formation
and dynamics due to the competition of two qualitatively different interaction
mechanisms, steric hindrance and quorum sensing, which are both relevant for
engineered phoretic microswimmers as well as for bacteria in biofilm formation.

very-high-energy (VHE; 100 GeV-100 TeV) $\gamma$-ray source by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). It is a faint VHE $\gamma$-ray emitter, though
its VHE flux exceeds both the extrapolation from early Fermi-LAT observations
as well as expectations from a (misaligned) single-zone synchrotron-self
Compton (SSC) description. The latter satisfactorily reproduces the emission
from Cen A at lower energies up to a few GeV. New observations with H.E.S.S.,
comparable in exposure time to those previously reported, were performed and
eight years of Fermi-LAT data were accumulated to clarify the spectral
characteristics of the $\gamma$-ray emission from the core of Cen A. The
results allow us for the first time to achieve the goal of constructing a
representative, contemporaneous $\gamma$-ray core spectrum of Cen A over almost
five orders of magnitude in energy. Advanced analysis methods, including the
template fitting method, allow detection in the VHE range of the core with a
statistical significance of 12$\sigma$ on the basis of 213 hours of total
exposure time. The spectrum in the energy range of 250 GeV-6 TeV is compatible
with a power-law function with a photon index
$\Gamma=2.52\pm0.13_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm0.20_{\mathrm{sys}}$. An updated
Fermi-LAT analysis provides evidence for spectral hardening by
$\Delta\Gamma\simeq0.4\pm0.1$ at $\gamma$-ray energies above
$2.8^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$ GeV at a level of $4.0\sigma$. The fact that the spectrum
hardens at GeV energies and extends into the VHE regime disfavour a single-zone
SSC interpretation for the overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
core and is suggestive of a new $\gamma$-ray emitting component connecting the
high-energy emission above the break energy to the one observed at VHE
energies.

tens of picoseconds. Molecular alignment in either one or three dimensions is
created by a slowly switched-on laser pulse, made field-free through rapid
pulse truncation, and retained thanks to the impeding effect of the helium
environment on molecular rotation. We illustrate the opportunities that
field-free aligned molecules open by measuring the alignment-dependent

cell and is an integral component of drug development, genetic engineering and
many other areas of cell biology. Traditionally, the correctness of
functionality of these systems is ascertained using paper-and-pencil proof and
computer simulation methods. However, the paper based proofs can be human-error
prone and the simulation provides an incomplete analysis due to its sampling
based nature and the inability to capture continuous behaviors in computer
based models. Model checking has been recently advocated for the analysis of
cell injection systems as well. However, it involves the discretization of the
differential equations that are used for modeling the dynamics of the system
and thus compromises on the completeness of the analysis as well. In this
paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving for the modeling
and analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the robotic cell injection systems.
The high expressiveness of the underlying logic allows us to capture the
continuous details of the model in their true form. Then, the model can be
analyzed using deductive reasoning within the sound core of a proof assistant.

incompressible viscous flow problems with moderate Reynolds number. The
proposed formulation fits within the framework of the finite cell method, where
essential boundary conditions are imposed weakly using a Nitsche-type method.
The key idea of the proposed formulation is to stabilize the jumps of
high-order derivatives of variables over the skeleton of the background mesh.
The formulation allows the use of identical finite-dimensional spaces for the
approximation of the pressure and velocity fields in immersed domains. The
stability issues observed for inf-sup stable discretizations of immersed
incompressible flow problems are avoided with this formulation. For B-spline
basis functions of degree $k$ with highest regularity, only the derivative of
order $k$ has to be controlled, which requires specification of only a single
stabilization parameter for the pressure field. The Stokes and Navier-Stokes
equations are studied numerically in two and three dimensions using various
immersed test cases. Oscillation-free solutions and high-order optimal
convergence rates can be obtained. The formulation is shown to be stable even
in limit cases where almost every elements of the physical domain is cut, and
hence it does not require the existence of interior cells. In terms of the
sparsity pattern, the algebraic system has a considerably smaller stencil than
counterpart approaches based on Lagrange basis functions. This important
property makes the proposed skeleton-stabilized technique computationally
practical. To demonstrate the stability and robustness of the method, we
perform a simulation of fluid flow through a porous medium, of which the
geometry is directly extracted from 3D $\mu{CT}$ scan data.

of the magnetic skyrmion lattice in bulk single-crystalline MnSi under electric

was observed in the SANS pattern for current densities greater than a threshold
value j_t ~ 1 MA/m^2 (10^6 A/m^2). We show this peak broadening to originate
from a spatially inhomogeneous rotation of the skyrmion lattice, with an
inverse rotation sense observed for opposite sample edges aligned with the

lattice rotations) remain finite even after switching off the electric current.
These results indicate that skyrmion lattices under current flow experience
significant friction near the sample edges, and plastic deformation due to
pinning effects, these being important factors that must be considered for the
anticipated skyrmion-based applications in chiral magnets at the nanoscale.

the atomistic approach taking account of surface anisotropy and the spin
misalignment it causes. We demonstrate that such inhomogeneous spin
configurations induce nutation in the dynamics of the particle's magnetization.
More precisely, in addition to the ordinary precessional motion with frequency
$f_{p}\sim10\,{\rm GHz}$, we find that the dynamics of the net magnetic moment
exhibits two more resonance peaks with frequencies $f_{c}$ and $f_{n}$ which
are higher than the frequency $f_{p} : f_{c}=4\times f_{p}\sim40\,{\rm GHz}$ is
related with the oscillations of the particle's magnetic moment between the
minima of the effective potential induced by weak surface anisotropy. On the
other hand, the much higher frequency $f_{n}\sim1\,{\rm THz}$ is attributed to
the magnetization fluctuations at the atomic level driven by exchange
interaction. We have compared our results on nutation induced by surface
effects with those rendered by the macroscopic approach based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by an inertial term (proportional to
the second-order time derivative of the macroscopic moment) with a
phenomenological coefficient. The good agreement between the two models have
allowed us to estimate the latter coefficient in terms of the atomistic

have interpreted the corresponding resonance peaks and their frequencies.

holomorphic isometric embeddings of the Poincar\'e disk into bounded symmetric
domains. As a first result we prove that any holomorphic curve exiting the
boundary of a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega$ must necessarily be
asymptotically totally geodesic. Assuming otherwise we derive by the method of
rescaling a hypothetical holomorphic isometric embedding of the Poincar\'e disk
with ${\rm Aut}(\Omega')$-equivalent tangent spaces into a tube domain $\Omega'
\subset \Omega$ and derive a contradiction by means of the Poincar\'e-Lelong
equation. We deduce that equivariant holomorphic embeddings between bounded
symmetric domains must be totally geodesic. Furthermore, we solve a
uniformization problem on algebraic subsets $Z \subset \Omega$. More precisely,
if $\check \Gamma\subset {\rm Aut}(\Omega)$ is a torsion-free discrete subgroup
leaving $Z$ invariant such that $Z/\check \Gamma$ is compact, we prove that $Z
\subset \Omega$ is totally geodesic. In particular, letting $\Gamma \subset{\rm
Aut}(\Omega)$ be a torsion-free cocompact lattice, and $\pi: \Omega \to
\Omega/\Gamma =: X_\Gamma$ be the uniformization map, a subvariety $Y \subset
X_\Gamma$ must be totally geodesic whenever some (and hence any) irreducible
component $Z$ of $\pi^{-1}(Y)$ is an algebraic subset of $\Omega$. For
cocompact lattices this yields a characterization of totally geodesic subsets
of $X_\Gamma$ by means of bi-algebraicity without recourse to the celebrated
monodromy result of Andr\'e-Deligne on subvarieties of Shimura varieties, and
as such our proof applies to not necessarily arithmetic cocompact lattices.

keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and
memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight
software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g.
state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this
paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the
blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates
and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We
show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel
quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data
structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the
benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the
device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction
of the amount of information transmitted in downlink (e.g., from the wireless
base station to the IoT device). A potential application of the proposed scheme
is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence
increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In
conclusion, our work is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design

improves generalization. For object detection, classical approaches for data
augmentation consist of generating images obtained by basic geometrical
transformations and color changes of original training images. In this work, we
go one step further and leverage segmentation annotations to increase the
number of object instances present on training data. For this approach to be
successful, we show that modeling appropriately the visual context surrounding
objects is crucial to place them in the right environment. Otherwise, we show
that the previous strategy actually hurts. With our context model, we achieve
significant mean average precision improvements when few labeled examples are
available on the VOC'12 benchmark.

designed to exploit small-baseline spatio-temporal consistency of events

depth-fusion strategy is also developed. The resulting method has no special

challenging task due to the concurrence of multiple sound events. Recently, SED
methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural
networks (RNN) have shown promising performance. Generally, CNN are designed
for local feature extraction while RNN are used to model the temporal
dependency among these local features. Despite their success, it is still
insufficient for existing deep learning techniques to separate individual sound
event from their mixture, largely due to the overlapping characteristic of
features. Motivated by the success of Capsule Networks (CapsNet), we propose a
more suitable capsule based approach for polyphonic SED. Specifically, several
capsule layers are designed to effectively select representative frequency
bands for each individual sound event. The temporal dependency of capsule's
outputs is then modeled by a RNN. And a dynamic threshold method is proposed
for making the final decision based on RNN outputs. Experiments on the TUT-SED

with the Monte Carlo simulated expectation in various distributions sensitive
to the effects of new physics. The significance of a deviation is quantified
using pseudo-experiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines
a signal region for a dedicated follow-up analysis with an improved background

allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect.
The sensitivity of the approach is discussed using Standard Model processes and

overall consistency of the Standard Model of particle physics. The current best
measurements of the $W$ boson mass come from single production measurements at
hadron colliders in its decay mode to a lepton (electron or muon) and a
neutrino and pair production of $W$ bosons at lepton colliders, where also the
decay mode of the $W$ boson to hadrons has been considered. In this study,
prospects for a measurement of the $W$ boson mass in the all-jet final state at
hadron colliders are presented. The feasibility of this measurement takes
advantage of numerous recent developments in the field of jet substructure.
Compared to other methods for measuring the $W$ mass, a measurement in the
all-jets final state would be complementary in methodology and have systematic
uncertainties orthogonal to previous measurements. We have estimated the main
experimental and theoretical uncertainties affecting a measurement in the
all-jet final state. With new trigger strategies, a statistical uncertainty for
the measurement of the mass difference between the $Z$ and $W$ bosons of 30 MeV
could be reached with HL-LHC data corresponding to 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity. However, in order to reach that precision, the current
understanding of non-perturbative contributions to the invariant mass of $W\to
q\bar{q}'$ and $Z\to b\bar{b}$ jets will need to be refined. Similar strategies
will also allow the reach for generic boosted resonances searches in hadronic

system that can reliably separate normals from abnormals can be invaluble
particularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this study was to develop and
validate a deep learning system to detect various abnormalities seen on a chest
X-ray. Methods: A deep learning system was trained on 2.3 million chest X-rays
and their corresponding radiology reports to identify various abnormalities
seen on a Chest X-ray. The system was tested against - 1. A three-radiologist
majority on an independent, retrospectively collected set of 2000
X-rays(CQ2000) 2. Radiologist reports on a separate validation set of 100,000
scans(CQ100k). The primary accuracy measure was area under the ROC curve (AUC),
estimated separately for each abnormality and for normal versus abnormal scans.
Results: On the CQ2000 dataset, the deep learning system demonstrated an AUC of
0.92(CI 0.91-0.94) for detection of abnormal scans, and AUC(CI) of
0.96(0.94-0.98), 0.96(0.94-0.98), 0.95(0.87-1), 0.95(0.92-0.98),

0.98(0.97-1) for the detection of blunted costophrenic angle, cardiomegaly,
cavity, consolidation, fibrosis, hilar enlargement, nodule, opacity and pleural
effusion. The AUCs were similar on the larger CQ100k dataset except for
detecting normals where the AUC was 0.86(0.85-0.86). Interpretation: Our study
demonstrates that a deep learning algorithm trained on a large, well-labelled
dataset can accurately detect multiple abnormalities on chest X-rays. As these
systems improve in accuracy, applying deep learning to widen the reach of chest
X-ray interpretation and improve reporting efficiency will add tremendous value

of the circumnuclear disk (CND) are not well constrained. We present results of
a velocity-resolved submillimeter scan (~480 to 1250 GHz}) and [CII]158um line
observations carried out with Herschel/HIFI toward Sgr A*; these results are
complemented by a ~2'x2' CO (J=3-2) map taken with the IRAM 30 m telescope at
~7'' resolution. We report the presence of high positive-velocity emission (up
to about +300 km/s) detected in the wings of CO J=5-4 to 10-9 lines. This wing
component is also seen in H2O (1_{1,0}-1_{0,1}) a tracer of hot molecular gas;
in [CII]158um, an unambiguous tracer of UV radiation; but not in [CI]492,806
GHz. This first measurement of the high-velocity CO rotational ladder toward
Sgr A* adds more evidence that hot molecular gas exists inside the cavity of
the CND, relatively close to the supermassive black hole (< 1 pc). Observed by
ALMA, this velocity range appears as a collection of CO (J=3-2) cloudlets lying
in a very harsh environment that is pervaded by intense UV radiation fields,
shocks, and affected by strong gravitational shears. We constrain the physical
conditions of the high positive-velocity CO gas component by comparing with
non-LTE excitation and radiative transfer models. We infer T_k~400 K to 2000 K
for n_H~(0.2-1.0)x10^5 cm^-3. These results point toward the important role of
stellar UV radiation, but we show that radiative heating alone cannot explain
the excitation of this ~10-60 M_Sun component of hot molecular gas inside the
central cavity. Instead, strongly irradiated shocks are promising candidates.

  Methods: The supergranular boundaries can be extracted by tracking
photospheric velocity plasma flows. The local ball-tracking method is employed
to apply on the HMI data gathered over the years 2011-2015 to estimate the
boundaries of the cells. The edge sharpening techniques are exerted on the
output of ball-tracking to precisely identify the cells borders. To study the
fractal dimensionality (FD) of supergranulation, the box counting method is

  Results: We found that both the size and eccentricity follow the log-normal
distributions with peak values about 330 Mm$^2$ and 0.85, respectively. The
five-year mean value of the cells number appeared in half-hour sequences is
obtained to be about 60 $\pm$ 6 within an area of

  Conclusions: The orientation of supergranular cells ($O$) and their size

non-roundish cells with smaller and larger sizes than 600 Mm$^2$ are aligned

arrive online. A gambler that knows the distributions must decide at each point
in time whether to stop and pick the current sample or to continue and lose
that sample forever. The goal of the gambler is to maximize the expected value
of what she picks and the performance measure is the worst case ratio between
the expected value the gambler gets and what a prophet, that sees all the
realizations in advance, gets. In the late seventies, Krengel and Sucheston,
and Gairing (1977) established that this worst case ratio is a universal
constant equal to 1/2. In the last decade prophet inequalities has resurged as
an important problem due to its connections to posted price mechanisms,
frequently used in online sales. A very interesting variant is the Prophet
Secretary problem, in which the only difference is that the samples arrive in a
uniformly random order. For this variant several algorithms achieve a constant
of 1-1/e and very recently this barrier was slightly improved. This paper
analyzes strategies that set a nonincreasing sequence of thresholds to be
applied at different times. The gambler stops the first time a sample surpasses
the corresponding threshold. Specifically we consider a class of strategies
called blind quantile strategies. They consist in fixing a function which is
used to define a sequence of thresholds once the instance is revealed. Our main
result shows that they can achieve a constant of 0.665, improving upon the best
known result of Azar et al. (2018), and on Beyhaghi et al. (2018) (order
selection). Our proof analyzes precisely the underlying stopping time
distribution, relying on Schur-convexity theory. We further prove that blind
strategies cannot achieve better than 0.675. Finally we prove that no algorithm
for the gambler can achieve better than 0.732.

paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on

video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and
robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely
synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across

the issue of a noise type mismatch between the training and testing conditions.
Such a mismatch is a critical problem in deep-learning-based SE systems. A
large mismatch may cause a serious performance degradation to the SE
performance. Because we generally use a well-trained SE system to handle
various unseen noise types, a noise type mismatch commonly occurs in real-world
scenarios. The proposed noise adaptive SE system contains an
encoder-decoder-based enhancement model and a domain discriminator model.
During adaptation, the DAT approach encourages the encoder to produce
noise-invariant features based on the information from the discriminator model
and consequentially increases the robustness of the enhancement model to unseen
noise types. Herein, we regard stationary noises as the source domain (with the
ground truth of clean speech) and non-stationary noises as the target domain

hydrogels films grafted on glass substrates in sliding contact with a glass
spherical probe. Friction experiments are carried out at various velocities and
applied normal loads with the contact fully immersed in water. In addition to
friction force measurements, a novel optical set-up is designed to image the
shape of the contact under steady-state sliding. The velocity-dependence of
both friction force $F_t$ and contact shape is found to be controlled by a
P\'eclet number Pe defined as the ratio of the time $\tau$ needed to drain the
water out of the contact region to a contact time $a/v$, where $v$ is the
sliding velocity and $a$ is the contact radius. When Pe<1, the equilibrium
circular contact achieved under static normal indentation remains unchanged
during sliding. Conversely, for Pe>1, a decrease in the contact area is
observed together with the development of a contact asymmetry when the sliding
velocity is increased. A maximum in $F_t$ is also observed at Pe~$\approx$~1.
These experimental observations are discussed in the light of a poroelastic
contact model based on a thin film approximation. This model indicates that the
observed changes in contact geometry are due to the development of a pore
pressure imbalance when Pe>1. An order of magnitude estimate of the friction
force and its dependence on normal load and velocity is also provided under the
assumption that most of the frictional energy is dissipated by poroelastic flow
at the leading and trailing edges of the sliding contact.

for cancer prevention. Here we report using LEM to analyze colonic tissues from

imaging the lasing emissions from chromatins, we discovered that, despite the
absence of observable lesions, polyps, or tumors under stereoscope, high-fat
mice exhibited significantly lower lasing thresholds than low-fat mice. The low
lasing threshold is, in fact, very similar to that of adenomas and is caused by
abnormal cell proliferation and chromatin deregulation that can potentially
lead to cancer. Our findings suggest that conventional methods, such as
colonoscopy, may be insufficient to reveal hidden or early tumors under

influenced by traffic congestion, road conditions and route geometry. Among
them route geometry at any point is not investigated enough to find a sound
spatial dynamics of timing delays and quality of public transport. This study
investigates the reliability of travel time to build a new key performance
indicator of public transport network. We have introduced a suitable point wise
clustering followed by an adapted statistical significance analysis. The
outcome is an estimation of absolute delay at geometrical points independent of
the delay at bus station. This outcome serves as an incremental delay towards
overall delay. Our investigation suggests that this novel metric of delay time
contributes around 23.56% in overall delay. The proposed methodology (here in
known as Delay Time and Quality of Service (DT QS)) is capable of providing
novel insights which attracts attention among policy makers of public transport
operators. The novel insight is coined with assignment of high value to
level-of-service attributes. Moreover, the proposed technique is independent of
any assumption of normal distribution.

These updates have to be transferred regularly from the source to the
destination. We consider scenarios in which an old packet becomes completely
obsolete, in the presence of a new packet. In this context, if a new packet
arrives at the source while it is transferring a packet, one needs to decide
the packet to be dropped. New packet has recent information, but might require
more time to transfer. Thus it is not clear as to which packet to be dis-
carded, and this is the main focus of the paper. Recently introduced
performance metrics, called average age of information (AAoI) and peak age of
information (PAoI) of the information available at the destination, are the
relevant performance measures. These type of systems do not require storage
buffers, of size more than one, at the source queue. We consider single source
/ multiple sources regularly updating information to a single destination
possibly over wireless channels to derive optimal drop policies that optimize
the AAoI. We showed that the state independent (static) policies like dropping
always the old packets or dropping always the new packets is optimal in many
scenarios, among an appropriate set of stationary Markov policies. We consider
relevant games when multiple sources compete. In many scenarios, the
non-cooperative solution almost minimizes the social objective, the sum of
AAoIs of all the sources.

virtual IP addresses, which are multiplexed to a real IP address of the host.
Multiplexing or de-multiplexing event dynamically remaps all the virtual
network addresses of the hosts. Therefore, at the end of a multiplexing event,
FRVM aims to make the attackers lose any knowledge gained through the
reconnaissance and to disturb their scanning strategy. In this work, we analyze

  fibres",,,,,"physics.optics cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimode fibres (MMF) are remarkable high-capacity information channels
owing to the large number of transmitting fibre modes, and have recently
attracted significant renewed interest in applications such as optical
communication, imaging, and optical trapping. At the same time, the optical
transmitting modes inside MMFs are highly sensitive to external perturbations
and environmental changes, resulting in MMF transmission channels being highly
variable and random. This largely limits the practical application of MMFs and
hinders the full exploitation of their information capacity. Despite great
research efforts made to overcome the high variability and randomness inside
MMFs, any geometric change to the MMF leads to completely different
transmission matrices, which unavoidably fails at the information recovery.
Here, we show the successful binary image transmission using deep learning
through a single MMF, which is stationary or subject to dynamic shape
variations. We found that a single convolutional neural network has excellent
generalisation capability with various MMF transmission states. This deep
neural network can be trained by multiple MMF transmission states to accurately
predict unknown information at the other end of the MMF at any of these states,
without knowing which state is present. Our results demonstrate that deep
learning is a promising solution to address the variability and randomness
challenge of MMF based information channels. This deep-learning approach is the
starting point of developing future high-capacity MMF optical systems and
devices, and is applicable to optical systems concerning other diffusing media.

images have limited capture range, and suffer from view dependent artefacts
such as acoustic shadows. Compounding of overlapping 3D US acquisitions into a
high-resolution volume can extend the field of view and remove image artefacts,
which is useful for retrospective analysis including population based studies.
However, such volume reconstructions require information about relative
transformations between probe positions from which the individual volumes were
acquired. In prenatal US scans, the fetus can move independently from the
mother, making external trackers such as electromagnetic or optical tracking
unable to track the motion between probe position and the moving fetus. We
provide a novel methodology for image-based tracking and volume reconstruction
by combining recent advances in deep learning and simultaneous localisation and
mapping (SLAM). Tracking semantics are established through the use of a
Residual 3D U-Net and the output is fed to the SLAM algorithm. As a proof of
concept, experiments are conducted on US volumes taken from a whole body fetal
phantom, and from the heads of real fetuses. For the fetal head segmentation,
we also introduce a novel weak annotation approach to minimise the required
manual effort for ground truth annotation. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, and quantitatively with respect to tissue discrimination
accuracy and tracking robustness.

optimal high-order spatial reconstruction wherever discontinuity is deemed to
be vanished, including at smooth critical points, and to avoid oscillations by
completely removing stencils crossing discontinuities. Moreover, the smoothness
measurement of TENO schemes is in fact acting as shock-detectors, which are
capable for distinguishing discontinuities and smooth critical points.
Following the idea of a recent improvement, i.e. TENO-NA, the shock-detection
and stencil-selection are completely separated in this work. Higher-order
polynomials using neighbouring points of the standard five-point TENO scheme
are applied for achieving higher-order accuracy without significantly
increasing computation cost, by exploring the neighbouring smoothness
measurements. In this work, seventh-order spatial accuracy is achieved, and the
computational complexity is similar to that of the five-point TENO scheme.
Especially, the presented method introduces new flexibility in constructing
high-order numerical methods. Numerical results are given to show the

computationally expensive due to the challenges involved in calculating
diffusion coefficients. Instead, mixture-averaged diffusion treatments are
typically used to avoid these costs. However, to our knowledge, the accuracy
and appropriateness of the mixture-averaged diffusion models has not been
verified for three-dimensional turbulent premixed flames. In this study we
propose a fast,efficient, low-memory algorithm and use that to evaluate the
role of multicomponent mass diffusion in reacting-flow simulations. Direct
numerical simulation of these flames is performed by implementing the
Stefan-Maxwell equations in NGA. A semi-implicit algorithm decreases the
computational expense of inverting the full multicomponent ordinary diffusion
array while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. We first verify the method by
performing one-dimensional simulations of premixed hydrogen flames and compare
with matching cases in Cantera. We demonstrate the algorithm to be stable, and
its performance scales approximately with the number of species squared. Then,
as an initial study of multicomponent diffusion, we simulate premixed,
three-dimensional turbulent hydrogen flames, neglecting secondary Soret and
Dufour effects. Simulation conditions are carefully selected to match
previously published results and ensure valid comparison. Our results show that
using the mixture-averaged diffusion assumption leads to a 15% under-prediction
of the normalized turbulent flame speed for a premixed hydrogen-air flame. This
difference in the turbulent flame speed motivates further study into using the
mixture-averaged diffusion assumption for DNS of moderate-to-high Karlovitz
number flames.
