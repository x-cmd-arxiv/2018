start and target positions: Revolving areas are regions where robots can
maneuver in order to give way to another moving robot. Given that this
assumption is fulfilled, the algorithm is complete, namely it is guaranteed to
find a solution or report that none exists. A key goal in our design is to make
the revolving areas as economical as possible and in particular to allow
different revolving areas to overlap. This makes the analysis rather involved
but in return makes the algorithm conceptually fairly simple. We show that for
the case of $m$ unit-discs moving among polygonal obstacles of total complexity
$n$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the algorithm can be executed in $O(n^2m +
m(m+n)\log(m+n))$ time. We implemented the algorithm for this case and tested

execution of the paths in decoupled algorithms that locally solve interferences
and show that finding the optimal order of execution is NP-hard. This motivated
us to develop a heuristic for choosing the order; we describe the heuristic and
demonstrate its effectiveness in certain scenarios.

$Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging in the WFC3/IR F160W and F125W filters reveals
a quadruply lensed system in a cusp configuration. We find that compared to the
central image of the cusp, the nearby, brightest image is anomalous by a factor
of $\sim7-11$. Although the source is extremely bright in the mid-infrared, a
magnification by a factor of $\sim50-120$ places an upper limit of 1.35 mJy on
the intrinsic mid-infrared brightness, well below the $WISE~W4$ detection limit
of 6 mJy. We find that this QSO is moderately reddened, with $E(B-V)=0.7$ and
that $\sim1\%$ of the intrinsic spectrum is leaked back into the line of sight
resulting in an upturn in its UV spectrum. We conclude that the QSO's reddening
is intrinsic and not due to the lens. Consistent with previous red quasar
samples, this source exhibits outflows in its spectrum as well as morphological
properties suggestive of it being in a merger-driven transitional phase.
Depending on how $L_{\rm bol}$ is computed, the quasar's accretion rate may be
as high as $0.26~L_{\rm Edd}$. We detect two Lyman limit systems, at $z=2.102$

to the QSO, and a putative lens redshift of $z=0.599$. Given the rarity of quad

shape-from-shading cues are used, assume that object appearance is
predominantly diffuse. To alleviate this restriction, we introduce S2Dnet, a
generative adversarial network for transferring multiple views of objects with
specular reflection into diffuse ones, so that multi-view reconstruction
methods can be applied more effectively. Our network extends unsupervised
image-to-image translation to multi-view ""specular to diffuse"" translation. To
preserve object appearance across multiple views, we introduce a Multi-View
Coherence loss (MVC) that evaluates the similarity and faithfulness of local
patches after the view-transformation. Our MVC loss ensures that the similarity
of local correspondences among multi-view images is preserved under the
image-to-image translation. As a result, our network yields significantly
better results than several single-view baseline techniques. In addition, we
carefully design and generate a large synthetic training data set using
physically-based rendering. During testing, our network takes only the raw
glossy images as input, without extra information such as segmentation masks or
lighting estimation. Results demonstrate that multi-view reconstruction can be
significantly improved using the images filtered by our network. We also show
promising performance on real world training and testing data.

large-sky radio surveys, namely the WENSS (325 MHz) and the ADR-TGSS (150 MHz).
These surveys offer the twin advantages of being fairly deep (typical rms $<$
10 mJy/beam) and having a sub-arcminute resolution. Their zone of overlap
spreads over 1.3$\pi$ steradian in the northern hemisphere. Radio spectra are
presented for the entire sample of 15 EISERS candidates, of which 8 spectra are

instances of k-Means and k-Median clustering in fixed dimension Euclidean
metrics (or more generally doubling metrics). The notion of stable or
perturbation resilient instances was introduced by Bilu and Linial [2010] and
Awasthi et al. [2012]. In our context we say a k-Means instance is
\alpha-stable if there is a unique OPT solution which remains unchanged if
distances are (non-uniformly) stretched by a factor of at most \alpha. Stable
clustering instances have been studied to explain why heuristics such as
Lloyd's algorithm perform well in practice. In this work we show that for any
fixed \epsilon>0, (1+\epsilon)-stable instances of k-Means in doubling metrics
can be solved in polynomial time. More precisely we show a natural multiswap
local search algorithm in fact finds the OPT solution for (1+\epsilon)-stable
instances of k-Means and k-Median in a polynomial number of iterations. We
complement this result by showing that under a plausible PCP hypothesis this is
essentially tight: that when the dimension d is part of the input, there is a
fixed \epsilon_0>0 s.t. there is not even a PTAS for (1+\epsilon_0)-stable
k-Means in R^d unless NP=RP. To do this, we consider a robust property of CSPs;
call an instance stable if there is a unique optimum solution x^* and for any
other solution x', the number of unsatisfied clauses is proportional to the
Hamming distance between x^* and x'. Dinur et al. have already shown stable
QSAT is hard to approximate for some constant Q, our hypothesis is simply that
stable QSAT with bounded variable occurrence is also hard. Given this
hypothesis, we consider ""stability-preserving"" reductions to prove our hardness
for stable k-Means. Such reductions seem to be more fragile than standard
L-reductions and may be of further use to demonstrate other stable optimization
problems are hard.

  on Information Theory (ISIT) 2018",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of identifiability of finite mixtures of finite product measures
is studied. A mixture model with $K$ mixture components and $L$ observed
variables is considered, where each variable takes its value in a finite set
with cardinality $M$.The variables are independent in each mixture component.
The identifiability of a mixture model means the possibility of attaining the
mixture components parameters by observing its mixture distribution. In this
paper, we investigate fundamental relations between the identifiability of
mixture models and the separability of their observed variables by introducing
two types of separability: strongly and weakly separable variables. Roughly
speaking, a variable is said to be separable, if and only if it has some
differences among its probability distributions in different mixture
components. We prove that mixture models are identifiable if the number of
strongly separable variables is greater than or equal to $2K-1$, independent
form $M$. This fundamental threshold is shown to be tight, where a family of
non-identifiable mixture models with less than $2K-1$ strongly separable
variables is provided. We also show that mixture models are identifiable if
they have at least $2K$ weakly separable variables. To prove these theorems, we
introduce a particular polynomial, called characteristic polynomial, which
translates the identifiability conditions to identity of polynomials and allows
us to construct an inductive proof.

theories of gravity that is indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime

show that the maximum mass that a differentially rotating neutron star can
sustain increases significantly for scalarized solutions and such stars can
reach larger angular momenta. In addition, the presence of a nontrivial scalar
field has the effect of increasing the required axis ratio for reaching a given
value of angular momentum, when compared to a corresponding model of same rest
mass in general relativity. We find that the scalar field also makes rapidly
rotating models less quasi-toroidal than their general-relativistic
counterparts. For large values of the angular momentum and values of the
coupling parameter that are in agreement with the observations, we find a
second turning point for scalarized models along constant angular momentum
sequences, which could have interesting implications for the stability of
remnants created in a binary neutron star merger.

problem in Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT). We present a detailed
study of carbon monoxide adsorption on fcc (111) surfaces of 3d, 4d and 5d
metals using nonempirical semilocal density functionals for the
exchange-correlation energy: the local-density approximation (LDA), two
generalized gradient approximations or GGAs (PBE and PBEsol), and a meta-GGA
(SCAN). The typical error pattern (as found earlier for free molecules and for
free transition metal surfaces), in which results improve from LDA to PBE or
PBEsol to SCAN, due to the satisfaction of more exact constraints, is not found
here. Instead, for CO adsorption on transition metal surfaces, we find that,
while SCAN overbinds much less than LDA, it overbinds slightly more than PBE.
Moreover, the tested functionals often predict the wrong adsorption site, as
first pointed out for LDA and GGA in the ``CO/Pt (111) puzzle"". This abnormal
pattern leads us to suspect that the errors of PBE and SCAN for this problem
are density-driven self-interaction errors associated with incorrect charge
transfer between molecule and metal surface. We point out that, by the
variational principle, overbinding by an approximate functional would be
reduced if that functional were applied not to its selfconsistent density for
the adsorbed system but to an exact or more correct density for that system.
Finally, we show for CO on Pt(111) that the site preference is corrected and
the adsorption energy is improved for the PBE functional by using not the
selfconsistent PBE density but a PBE+U density. The resulting correction to the
PBE total energy is much larger for the adsorbed system than for its desorbed
components, showing that the error is in the density of the adsorbed system.
This seems to solve the ``CO/Pt (111) puzzle"", in principle if not fully in
practice.

hydrodynamic equations of motion. Such a treatment captures the

bifurcations between primal solutions and the QC, SOCP, and SDP relaxation

fundamental to much of statistical machine learning. Thus, learning
probabilistic representations directly from data is a deep challenge, the main
computational bottleneck being inference that is intractable. Tractable
learning is a powerful new paradigm that attempts to learn distributions that
support efficient probabilistic querying. By leveraging local structure,
representations such as sum-product networks (SPNs) can capture high tree-width
models with many hidden layers, essentially a deep architecture, while still
admitting a range of probabilistic queries to be computable in time polynomial
in the network size. The leaf nodes in SPNs, from which more intricate mixtures
are formed, are tractable univariate distributions, and so the literature has
focused on Bernoulli and Gaussian random variables. This is clearly a
restriction for handling mixed discrete-continuous data, especially if the
continuous features are generated from non-parametric and non-Gaussian
distribution families. In this work, we present a framework that systematically
integrates SPN structure learning with weighted model integration, a recently
introduced computational abstraction for performing inference in hybrid
domains, by means of piecewise polynomial approximations of density functions
of arbitrary shape. Our framework is instantiated by exploiting the notion of
propositional abstractions, thus minimally interfering with the SPN structure
learning module, and supports a powerful query interface for conditioning on
interval constraints. Our empirical results show that our approach is
effective, and allows a study of the trade off between the granularity of the
learned model and its predictive power.

analyses, a fully Bayesian nearest-neighbor Gaussian process model is posed to
estimate Antarctic SMB and propose new field measurement locations. A
corresponding Antarctic SMB map is rendered using this model and is compared
with previous estimates. A prediction uncertainty map is created to identify
regions of high SMB uncertainty. The model estimates net SMB to be 2345 Gton

Overall, these results suggest lower Antarctic SMB than previously reported.

significantly promote transition in a three-dimensional boundary layer
dominated by crossflow insta- bility. This sensitive effect has not yet been
fully explained physically and mathematically. Unlike past researches focusing
on the receptivity of the boundary layer to surface roughness, or on the local
stability of the modified mean flow, this paper seeks possible inherent
mechanisms by investigating the effects of distributed surface roughness on
crossflow instability through resonant interactions with eigenmodes. A key
observation is that the perturbation induced by roughness with specific
wavenumbers can interact with two eigenmodes (travelling and stationary
vortices) through triadic resonance, or interact with one eigenmode (stationary
vortices) through Bragg scattering. Unlike the usual triadic resonance of
neutral, or nearly neutral, eigenmodes, the present triadic resonance can take
place among modes with O(1) growth rates, provided that these are equal; unlike
the usual Bragg scattering involving neutral waves, crossflow stationary
vortices can also be unstable. For these amplifying waves, the generalized
triadic resonance and Bragg scattering are put forward, and the resulting
corrections to the growth rates are derived by a multiple-scale method. The
analysis is extended to the case where up to four crossflow vortices interact
with each other in the presence of suitable roughness components. The numerical
results for Falkner-Skan-Cooke boundary layers show that roughness with a small
height (a few percent of the local boundary-layer thickness) can change growth
rates substantially (by a more-or-less O(1) amount)....

accounting for the joint degree distribution of a network within a generating
function framework, we can quantify how degree correlations affect both the
onset of global cascades and the propensity of nodes of specific degree class
to trigger large cascades. However, not all degree correlations are equally
important in a spreading process. We introduce a new measure of degree
assortativity that accounts for correlations among nodes relevant to a
spreading cascade. We show that the critical point defining the onset of global
cascades has a monotone relationship to this new assortativity measure. In
addition, we show that the choice of nodes to seed the largest cascades is
strongly affected by degree correlations. Contrary to traditional wisdom, when
degree assortativity is positive, low degree nodes are more likely to generate
largest cascades. Our work suggests that it may be possible to tailor spreading
processes by manipulating the higher-order structure of networks.

not detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s channels of around 6 mK. The
non-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of
~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local

grain surface chemistry in the parent cloud of L1544 or in the outer regions of
L1544 which are not fully shielded from the interstellar FUV radiation. The
mechanism is the most efficient at the chemical transition from atomic to
molecular nitrogen. In other words, our result suggests that the gas in the
central part of L1544 already went trough the transition from atomic to
molecular nitrogen in the earlier evolutionary stage, and that N2 is currently
the primary form of gas-phase nitrogen.

closes this gap and provides the first study of thermal conductivity of

any size effect in films as thin as 48 nm, which indicates that propagons
contribute negligibly to the thermal conductivity and that the thermal
transport is dominated by diffusons. Density-function-theory (DFT) simulations
combined with a diffuson-mediated minimum-thermal-conductivity model confirms
this finding. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity is lower than the
amorphous limit (Cahill model), which proves that the diffuson model works
better than the Cahill model to describe the thermal conduction mechanism in
the amorphous Nb2O5 thin films. Additionally, the thermal conductivity does not
change significantly with oxygen vacancy concentration. This stable and low

interaction with the gas in the host galaxy is calculated. Physical processes
such as star formation and SNe feedback are taken into account. Consistent with

introduce an inhomogeneous structure containing more than one phase, which can
reduce the local nonuniform shear deformation and hinder its percolation
throughout the system. Using thermostated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
we compare the deformation behavior between a homogeneous amorphous mixture of
bidisperse disc particles, interacting via an n-6 Lennard-Jones potential of
tunable softness, with an inhomogeneous one containing an evenly-distributed
ordered phase. We change the population ratio of large to small particles to
create a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous mixture, where the softness of a
chosen phase can be manually adjusted by specifying n of the interparticle
potential. Results of applying extensive quasistatic shear on the prepared
mixtures reveal that the inhomogeneous amorphous mixture containing a soft
ordered phase overall deforms more uniformly than the homogeneous one, which
indicates that both the structure inhomogeneity and the inter-phase softness
variance play important roles in enhancing the uniformity of the plastic

influences the dynamical and chemical evolution of a galaxy, redistributing
material throughout the circumgalatic medium. Non-thermal feedback from
galactic cosmic rays (CRs) -high-energy charged particles accelerated in
supernovae and young stars - can impact the efficiency of wind driving. The
streaming instability limits the speed at which they can escape. However, in
the presence of turbulence, the streaming instability is subject to suppression
that depends on the magnetization of turbulence given by its Alfv\'en Mach
number. While previous simulations that relied on a simplified model of CR
transport have shown that super-Alfv\'enic streaming of CRs enhances galactic
winds, in the present paper we take into account a realistic model of streaming
suppression. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a
section of a galactic disk and find that turbulent damping dependent on local
magnetization of turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) leads to more spatially
extended gas and CR distributions compared to the earlier streaming
calculations, and that scale-heights of these distributions increase for
stronger turbulence. Our results indicate that the star formation rate
increases with the level of turbulence in the ISM. We also find that the
instantaneous wind mass loading is sensitive to local streaming physics with
the mass loading dropping significantly as the strength of turbulence
increases.

\texttt{IncrePR} with several restarts can be used to find a good initial

incorporate the geometry of the posterior informed by data so that they are
capable of exploring complex probability structures. However, the required
geometric quantities are usually expensive to obtain in high dimensions. On the
other hand, most geometric information of the unknown parameter space in this
setting is concentrated in an \emph{intrinsic} finite-dimensional subspace. To
mitigate the computational intensity and scale up the applications of
infinite-dimensional geometric MCMC ($\infty$-GMC), we apply geometry-informed
algorithms to the intrinsic subspace to probe its complex structure, and
simpler methods like preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) to its geometry-flat
complementary subspace. In this work, we take advantage of dimension reduction
techniques to accelerate the original $\infty$-GMC algorithms. More
specifically, partial spectral decomposition of the (prior or posterior)
covariance operator is used to identify certain number of principal
eigen-directions as a basis for the intrinsic subspace. The combination of
dimension-independent algorithms, geometric information, and dimension
reduction yields more efficient implementation, \emph{(adaptive)
dimension-reduced infinite-dimensional geometric MCMC}. With a small amount of
computational overhead, we can achieve over 70 times speed-up compared to pCN
using a simulated elliptic inverse problem and an inverse problem involving
turbulent combustion. A number of error bounds comparing various MCMC proposals

Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and

constructing complex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image features
with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the
rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to

learning and its representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network

with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance
further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different

or transient states with static and dynamic topologically nontrivial
configurations: electronic vortices as dislocations, instantons as phase slip
centers, and ensembles of microscopic solitons. Describing and modeling these
states and processes calls for an efficient phenomenological theory which
should take into account the degenerate order parameter, various kinds of
normal carriers and the electric field. Here we notice that the commonly
employed time-depend Ginzburg-Landau approach suffers with violation of the
charge conservation law resulting in unphysical generation of particles which
is particularly strong for nucleating or moving electronic vortices. We present
a consistent theory which exploits the chiral transformations taking into
account the principle contribution of the fermionic chiral anomaly to the
effective action. The resulting equations clarify partitions of charges,
currents and rigidity among subsystems of the condensate and normal carriers.
On this basis we perform the numerical modeling of a spontaneously generated
coherent sequence of phase slips - the space-time vortices - serving for the
conversion among the injected normal current and the collective one.

of extracting latent features. When dealing with large and sparse datasets,
traditional recommendation algorithms face the problem of acquiring large,
unrestrained, fluctuating values over predictions especially for users/items
with very few corresponding observations. Although the problem has been
somewhat solved by imposing bounding constraints over its objectives, and/or
over all entries to be within a fixed range, in terms of gaining better
recommendations, these approaches have two major shortcomings that we aim to
mitigate in this work: one is they can only deal with one pair of fixed bounds
for all entries, and the other one is they are very time-consuming when applied
on large scale recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
named Magnitude Bounded Matrix Factorisation (MBMF), which allows different
bounds for individual users/items and performs very fast on large scale
datasets. The key idea of our algorithm is to construct a model by constraining
the magnitudes of each individual user/item feature vector. We achieve this by
converting from the Cartesian to Spherical coordinate system with radii set as
the corresponding magnitudes, which allows the above constrained optimisation
problem to become an unconstrained one. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
method is then applied to solve the unconstrained task efficiently. Experiments
on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that in most cases the proposed MBMF
is superior over all existing algorithms in terms of accuracy and time
complexity.

significantly the constraints on the features parameters up to $16\%$ for
models predicting a suppression of power of the quadrupole and up to $27\%$ for
models with features at $\ell \sim 22$, assuming instrumental sensitivity
similar to the $Planck$ satellite (depending on the goodness of the ISW

low-dimensional materials, has been always an exciting and fundamental subject
of research. Recent experiments on twisted bilayer graphene have revealed
reentrant unconventional superconductivity as a function of doping as well as a
Mott-like insulating phase when the two layers are twisted with respect to each
other at certain ""magic"" angles for doping corresponding to two particles per
moire unit cell. In this work we propose a microscopic model that takes into
account interactions and the van Hove singularities in the density of states of
the twisted bilayer graphene at doping corresponding to one particle ($\nu$ =1)
per moir\'{e} unit cell and study how superconductivity emerges. We identify
the possible symmetry of the order parameter as $s^{\pm}$, while if the
inter-valley coupling is negligible the symmetry is $s^{++}$. In addition, we
find and characterise the insulating region of the system, as a region with a
uniform charge instability where there is coexistence of the metallic and
insulating phases.

probability to reason and learn from data. Perhaps the most successful paradigm
in the field is probabilistic logic programming: the enabling of stochastic
primitives in logic programming, which is now increasingly seen to provide a
declarative background to complex machine learning applications. While many
systems offer inference capabilities, the more significant challenge is that of
learning meaningful and interpretable symbolic representations from data. In
that regard, inductive logic programming and related techniques have paved much
of the way for the last few decades.
  Unfortunately, a major limitation of this exciting landscape is that much of
the work is limited to finite-domain discrete probability distributions.
Recently, a handful of systems have been extended to represent and perform
inference with continuous distributions. The problem, of course, is that
classical solutions for inference are either restricted to well-known
parametric families (e.g., Gaussians) or resort to sampling strategies that
provide correct answers only in the limit. When it comes to learning, moreover,
inducing representations remains entirely open, other than ""data-fitting""
solutions that force-fit points to aforementioned parametric families.
  In this paper, we take the first steps towards inducing probabilistic logic
programs for continuous and mixed discrete-continuous data, without being
pigeon-holed to a fixed set of distribution families. Our key insight is to
leverage techniques from piecewise polynomial function approximation theory,
yielding a principled way to learn and compositionally construct density
functions. We test the framework and discuss the learned representations.

architecture, which can control multiple CCDs and can be easily expanded. The
controller has a modular backplane architecture consists of Single Board
Controller Cards (SBCs) and can control a mosaic or independent of 5 CCDs. Key
features of IDSAC contains usage of FPGA as a reconfigurable master controller,
implementation of Digital CDS to achieve low noise and ability to process upto
four CCD output at 1Mpixels/Sec/Channel with 16-bit resolution. The best
feature of IDSAC is it uses the technique of Digital Correlated Double
Sampling(DCDS). It is known that CCD video output is dominated by thermal KTC
noise contributed from the summing well capacitor of the CCD output circuitry.
To eliminate thermal KTC noise Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) is a very
standard technique. CDS performed in Digital domain (DCDS) has several
advantages over its analog counterpart, such as - less electronics, faster
readout and easier post processing. It is also flexible with sampling rate and
pixel throughput while maintaining the core circuit topology intact. The noise
characterization of the IDSAC CDS signal chain has been performed by analytical
modelling, software simulation and practical measurements. Various types of
noise such as white, pink, power supply, bias etc. has been considered while
creating a analytical noise model tool to predict noise of a controller system
like IDSAC. Standard test bench softwares like Pspice and Multisim are used to
simulate the noise performance while several tests are performed to measure the
actual noise of IDSAC.The theoretical calculation matches very well with
component level simulation as well as practical measurements within 10%
accuracy.

subclass of combinatorial auctions and has been studied extensively from both

a natural online setting in which items arrive one-by-one and should be
allocated irrevocably upon arrival. In this setting, it is well known that the
greedy algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of 1/2, and recently Kapralov et

despite this impossibility result, Korula et al. (2015) were able to show that

of online SWM in which the sets defining a (simple) partition matroid arrive

generation of perturbations in the early universe. Recently, there has been a
surge in interest in examining the issue of primordial magnetogenesis in the
context of bouncing universes. As in the case of inflation, the conformal
invariance of the electromagnetic action needs to be broken in bouncing
scenarios in order to generate primordial magnetic fields which correspond to
observed strengths today. The non-minimal coupling, which typically depends on
a scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads to a
cross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the
perturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic fields. This has been studied
in some detail in the context of inflation and, specifically, it has been
established that the three-point function satisfies the so-called consistency
relation in the squeezed limit. In this work, we study the cross-correlation
between the magnetic fields and the perturbation in an auxiliary scalar field
in a certain class of bouncing scenarios. We consider couplings that lead to
scale invariant spectra of the magnetic field and evaluate the corresponding
cross-correlation between the magnetic field and the perturbation in the scalar
field. We find that, when compared to de Sitter inflation, the dimensionless
non-Gaussianity parameter that characterizes the amplitude of the
cross-correlations proves to be considerably larger in bouncing scenarios. We
also show that the aforementioned consistency condition governing the
cross-correlation is violated in the bouncing models. We discuss the
implications of our results.

different Gaussian tracking windows (0.8arcsec and 0.2arcsec), which reveals
two types of horizontal motions for umbral features. First, a global inner
penumbra and peripheral umbra inward motion directed to the central parts is
revealed as an overall proper motion of bright peripheral fine structures.
Second, motions matching small cells inside the darkest parts of the umbra with
apparent sink and source areas are revealed, suggesting possible upflows and
downflows appearing in different bright and dark locations without a definite
answer regarding their brightness identification with a convective or a buoyant

background necessary for the rest of the thesis (with special emphasis in the
space of embeddings and the Fock construction). Chapter two is based on our
papers arXiv:1701.00735, arXiv:1611.09603, and arXiv:1501.05114. We study
carefully a system consisting of a string with two masses attached to the ends
and try to establish if we can identify degrees of freedom at the boundary both
classically and quantically (spoiler alert: it is not possible). The next
chapter is a brief introduction to the parametrized theories with the simple
example of the parametrized classical mechanics. The 4th chapter deals with the
parametrized electromagnetism with boundaries, a generalization of our paper
arXiv:1511.00826. The following chapter focuses on the parametrized scalar
field with boundaries (see arXiv:1507.05438). The 6th chapter deals with the
parametrized Maxwell-Chern-Simons and Chern-Simons theories with boundaries.
Chapter seven delves into the theory of general relativity using the GNH
algorithm, showing that the Hamiltonian formulation (ADM) can be obtained in a
more direct and simple way. The same study is performed over the unimodular
gravity. In the last chapter we gather the conclusions and some hints about the
future work. Finally, an appendix is included with some additional mathematical
topics as well as explicit computations.

nucleus. It provides an extremely useful test ground for nuclear models and is
crucial to understand energy generation in stars as well as the heavy elements
synthesized in stellar explosions. Nuclear physicists have been attempting at
developing a precise, reliable, and predictive nuclear model that is suitable
for the whole nuclear chart, while this still remains a great challenge even in
recent days. Here we employ the Fourier spectral analysis to examine the
deviations of nuclear mass predictions to the experimental data and to present
a novel way for accurate nuclear mass predictions. In this analysis, we map the
mass deviations from the space of nucleon number to its conjugate space of
frequency, and are able to pin down the main contributions to the model
deficiencies. By using the radial basis function approach we can further
isolate and quantify the sources. Taking a pedagogical mass model as an
example, we examine explicitly the correlation between nuclear effective
interactions and the distributions of mass deviations in the frequency domain.
The method presented in this work, therefore, opens up a new way for improving
the nuclear mass predictions towards a hundred kilo-electron-volt accuracy,
which is argued to be the chaos-related limit for the nuclear mass predictions.

cm global brightness temperature from cosmic dawn at $z\sim 17$, potentially
indicating new phenomena beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. A generic cosmological
model which allows conformal and disformal couplings between dark matter and
dark energy is employed to investigate the impact on the 21cm absorption signal
and understand the EDGES anomaly. After exploring a wide range of parameter
space for couplings, we find that the coupling effects can lead to a moderate
change in the Hubble parameter while a negligible change in the spin
temperature in the early Universe. Consequently, the decrease of the Hubble
parameter from the mixed conformal and disformal couplings can reproduce the
21cm absorption approximately in consistent with the EDGES result at $z=17.5$.
However, there is still tension in corresponding parameter space between EDGES
and other cosmological observations for this model.

One of the sources is the application of the results of measurements of the

suppression caused by a possibility of inelastic interaction with the spectator
partons is calculated at the amplitude level, differently from the usual
probabilistic description. It turns out, however, that interaction with the
spectator partons not only suppresses the SD cross section, but also gives rise
to the main mechanism of SD dijet production, which is another important source
of factorization failure. Our parameter-free calculations of SD-to-inclusive
cross section ratio, performed in the dipole representation, agrees with the
corresponding CDF Tevatron (Run II) data at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV in the relevant

opposite to the factorisation-based expectations, similarly to the effect
observed earlier in diffractive Abelian radiation.

extension is not continuous fail to converge uniformly due to rapid Gibbs
oscillations near the boundary. Among several approaches that have been
proposed toward the resolution of Gibbs phenomenon in recent years, a Fourier
continuation (FC) based approximation scheme has been suggested by Bruno and
collaborators in the context of certain PDE solvers where approximation grids
used are equispaced. While the practical efficacy of FC based schemes in
obtaining a high-order numerical solution of PDEs is well known, theoretical
convergence analyses largely remain unavailable. The primary objective of this
paper is to take a step in this direction where we analyze the convergence
rates of a Fourier continuation framework for approximations based on discrete
functional data coming from equispaced grids. In this context, we explore a
certain two-point Hermite interpolation strategy for constructing Fourier
continuations that, not only simplifies the implementation of such
approximations but also makes possible a rigorous analysis of its numerical
properties. In particular, we show that the approximations converge with order
$r+1$ for functions coming from a subspace of $C^{r,1}([0,1])$, the space of
$r$-times continuously differentiable function whose $r$th derivative is
Lipschitz continuous. We also demonstrate that theoretical rates are indeed
achieved in practice, through a variety of numerical experiments.

access channels (MIMO mMAC) is investigated. While joint typicality decoding is
utilized to establish the achievability of capacity region for conventional MAC
with fixed number of users, the technique is not directly applicable for MIMO
mMAC. Instead, an information-theoretic approach based on Gallager's error
exponent analysis is exploited to characterize the
\textcolor[rgb]{0,0,0}{finite dimension region} of MIMO mMAC. Theoretical
results reveal that the finite dimension region of MIMO mMAC is dominated by
sum rate constraint only, and the individual user rate is determined by a
specific factor that corresponds to the allocation of sum rate. The rate in
conventional MAC is not achievable with massive multiple access, which is due
to the fact that successive interference cancellation cannot guarantee an
arbitrary small error decoding probability for MIMO mMAC. The results further
imply that, asymptotically, the individual user rate is independent of the
number of transmit antennas, and channel hardening makes the individual user
rate close to that when only statistic knowledge of channel is available at
receiver. The finite dimension region of MIMO mMAC is a generalization of the
symmetric rate in Chen \emph{et al.} (2017).

Consequently, an effective social influence prediction for each user is
critical for a variety of applications such as online recommendation and

  Conventional social influence prediction approaches typically design various
hand-crafted rules to extract user- and network-specific features. However,
their effectiveness heavily relies on the knowledge of domain experts. As a
result, it is usually difficult to generalize them into different domains.
Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks in a wide range of

users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In
general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural
network for learning her latent social representation. We design strategies to
incorporate both network structures and user-specific features into
convolutional neural and attention networks. Extensive experiments on Open

  Process Priors",,,"10.1109/TSP.2018.2858207",,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a new sparse spatio-temporal structured Gaussian
process regression framework for online and offline Bayesian inference. This is
the first framework that gives a time-evolving representation of the
interdependencies between the components of the sparse signal of interest. A
hierarchical Gaussian process describes such structure and the
interdependencies are represented via the covariance matrices of the prior
distributions. The inference is based on the expectation propagation method and
the theoretical derivation of the posterior distribution is provided in the
paper. The inference framework is thoroughly evaluated over synthetic, real
video and electroencephalography (EEG) data where the spatio-temporal evolving
patterns need to be reconstructed with high accuracy. It is shown that it
achieves 15% improvement of the F-measure compared with the alternating
direction method of multipliers, spatio-temporal sparse Bayesian learning
method and one-level Gaussian process model. Additionally, the required memory
for the proposed algorithm is less than in the one-level Gaussian process
model. This structured sparse regression framework is of broad applicability to
source localisation and object detection problems with sparse signals.

$\gamma=2$ corresponds to isothermal] and for the members of the galaxy group.
Moreover, our mass models with and without the group find an inner mass-density
slope steeper than isothermal for the main lensing galaxy, with $\gamma_1 =
2.08 \pm 0.02$ and $\gamma_2 = 2.16 \pm 0.02$ at the 4.2$\sigma$ level and

distributed image position residuals of about 3 mas, which are much larger that
the measurement errors ($40$ $\mu$as on average). This suggests that at the mas
level, the assumption of a smooth mass distribution fails, requiring additional
structure in the model. However, given the environment of the lensing galaxy,
it is not clear whether this extra mass is in the form of sub-haloes within the
lens or along the line of sight, or from a more complex halo for the galaxy

is due to their unique feature of frequency band gaps. For example, their
capability to filter out the incoming elastic waves, which include seismic
waves, will have a significant impact on the seismic safety of nuclear
infrastructure. In order to accurately design the desired frequency band gaps,
one must pay attention on how the input parameters and the interaction of the
parameters can affect the frequency band gaps. Global sensitivity analysis can
decompose the dispersion relationship of the phononic crystals and screen the
variance attributed to each of the parameters and the interaction between them.
Prior to the application in one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystals, this paper
will first review the theory of global sensitivity analysis using variance
decomposition (Sobol sensitivity analysis). Afterwards, the sensitivity
analysis is applied to study a simple mathematical model with three input
variables for better understanding of the concept. Then, the sensitivity
analysis is utilized to study the characteristic of the first frequency band
gap in 1D phononic crystals with respect to the input parameters. This study
reveals the quantified influence of the parameters and their correlation in
determining the first frequency band gap. In addition, simple straight-forward
design equations based on reduced Sobol functions are proposed to easily
estimate the first frequency band gap. Finally, the error associated with the
proposed design equations is also addressed.
