that the emphasis on physical embodiment in some segments of the social

viable quantum information processor, but achieving both in the same system has
proved challenging for spin qubits. We propose and analyze an approach to
perform a long-distance two-qubit controlled phase (CPHASE) gate between two
singlet-triplet qubits using an electromagnetic resonator to mediate their
interaction. The qubits couple longitudinally to the resonator, and by driving
the qubits near the resonator's frequency they can be made to acquire a
state-dependent geometric phase that leads to a CPHASE gate independent of the
initial state of the resonator. Using high impedance resonators enables gate
times of order 10 ns while maintaining long coherence times. Simulations show
average gate fidelities of over 96% using currently achievable experimental
parameters and over 99% using state-of-the-art resonator technology. After
optimizing the gate fidelity in terms of parameters tuneable in-situ, we find
it takes a simple power-law form in terms of the resonator's impedance and
quality and the qubits' noise bath.

we are able to study this merger in a detailed way. We divide the whole merger
into the core and tail regions, and fit both the optical spectrum and the
multi-band spectral energy distribution (SED) to models to obtain the star
formation properties for each region respectively. We find that the color
excess of stars in the galaxy $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$ measured with the multi-band SED
fitting is consistent with that estimated both from the infrared excess (the
ratio of IR to UV flux) and from the slope of the UV continuum. Furthermore,
the reliability of the $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$ is examined with a set of mock SEDs,
showing that the dust attenuation of the stars can be well constrained by the
UV-to-IR broadband SED fitting. The dust attenuation obtained from optical
continuum $E(B-V)_s^{spec}$ is only about half of $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$. The ratio
of the $E(B-V)_s^{spec}$ to the $E(B-V)_g$ obtained from the Balmer decrement
is consistent with the local value (around 0.5). The difference between the
results from the UV-to-IR data and the optical data is consistent with the
picture that younger stellar populations are attenuated by an extra dust
component from the birth clouds compared to older stellar populations which are
only attenuated by the diffuse dust. Both with the UV-to-IR SED fitting and the
spectral fitting, we find that there is a starburst younger than 100~Myr in one
of the two core regions, consistent with the scenario that the
interaction-induced gas inflow can enhance the star formation in the center of
galaxies.

In this first step, we focus on exploring the factors that affect the
performance of such neural networks, such as the amount of training data,
number and nature of layers and the hyperparameters. We begin with a simple
experiment in which we only differentiate between two extreme morphologies,
using compact and multiple component extended sources. We found that a three
convolutional layer architecture yielded very good results, achieving a
classification accuracy of 97.4% on a test data set. The same architecture was
then tested on a four-class problem where we let the network classify sources
into compact and three classes of extended sources, achieving a test achieving
a test accuracy of 93.5%. The best-performing convolutional neural network
setup has been verified against RGZ Data Release 1 where a final test accuracy
of 94.8% was obtained, using both original and augmented images. The use of
sigma clipping does not offer a significant benefit overall, except in cases

radius of a solitonic core scales inversely with its mass, tidal stripping
results in a runaway effect and rapid tidal disruption of the core once its
central density drops below $4.5$ times the average density of the host within
the orbital radius. Additionally, we find that the core is deformed into a
tidally locked ellipsoid with increasing eccentricities until it is completely
disrupted. Using the core mass loss rate, we compute the minimum mass of cores
that can survive several orbits for different FDM particle masses and compare
it with observed masses of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.

filaments, and the field, but it is still uncertain whether such differences
are imprints of the tidal environment on galaxy formation, or if they reflect
the variation of the underlying halo mass function across the cosmic web. We
measure the dependence of galaxy clustering and quenching on the cosmic web in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, characterized by the combination of spherical
overdensity $\delta_8$ and tidal anisotropy $\alpha_5$ centred on each galaxy.
We find that galaxy clustering is a strong function of either $\delta_8$ or
$\alpha_5$, and the large-scale galaxy bias shows complex and rich behaviour on
the $\delta_8$ vs. $\alpha_5$ plane. Using the mean galaxy colour as a proxy
for the average quenched level of galaxies, we find that galaxy quenching is
primarily a function of $\delta_8$, with some subtle yet non-trivial dependence
on $\alpha_5$ at fixed $\delta_8$. The quenched galaxies generally show
stronger small-scale clustering than the star-forming ones at fixed $\delta_8$
or $\alpha_5$, while the characteristic scale at which the amplitude of
clustering becomes comparable for both galaxy populations varies with
$\delta_8$ and $\alpha_5$. We compare these observed cosmic web dependences of
galaxy clustering and quenching with a mock galaxy catalogue constructed from
the iHOD model, which places quenched and star-forming galaxies inside dark
matter haloes based on the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the halo quenching
model --- the $\delta_8$ and $\alpha_5$ dependences of iHOD galaxies are thus
solely derived from the cosmic web modulation of the halo mass function. The
main observed trends are accounted for extremely well by the iHOD model. Thus
any additional direct effect of the large-scale~(${>}5\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) tidal
field on galaxy formation must be extremely weak. [Abridged]

neutrons and X-rays. The spectral (or frequency) moments of the dynamic
structure factor define directly the sum rules of the scattering law. The
theoretical scheme formulated in this study allows one to describe the dynamics
of local density fluctuations in simple liquids and to obtain the expression of
the dynamic structure factor in terms of the spectral moments. The theory
satisfies all the sum rules, and the obtained expression for the dynamic
structure factor yields correct extrapolations into the hydrodynamic limit as
well as into the free-particle dynamics limit. We discuss correspondence of
this theory with the generalized hydrodynamics and with the viscoelastic
models, which are commonly used to analyze the data of inelastic neutron and
X-ray scattering in liquids. In particular, we reveal that the postulated

meet, for any finite value of the coupling parameters ratio there are two phase
transition: one from the paramagnetic phase to one of the two nematic-like

absorption is affected by the mass, geometry, temperature, and ionisation
conditions in the absorbing gas. Observations at the lowest radio frequencies
constrain a combination of these properties. We use LOFAR LBA observations at
30-77 MHz and L-band VLA observations to compare $u-v$-matched images with a
common resolution of 17"". We simultaneously fit, per pixel, for the emission
measure and the ratio of the emission from the unabsorbed front of the shell
versus the absorbed back of the shell. We explore the effects that low
temperatures and a high degree of clumping can have on the derived physical
properties, such as mass and density. We also compile published radio flux
measurements, fit for the absorption processes that occur in the radio band,
and consider how they affect the secular decline of the source. We find a mass
in the unshocked ejecta of $M = 2.95 \pm {0.48} \,M_{\odot}$ for an assumed gas
temperature of $T=100$ K. This estimate is reduced for colder gas temperatures
and if the ejecta are clumped. We measure the reverse shock to have a radius of
$114$"" $\pm $6"". We also find that a decrease in the amount of mass in the
unshocked ejecta (as more and more material meets the reverse shock and heats
up) cannot account for the observed low frequency behaviour of the secular
decline rate. To reconcile our low frequency absorption measurements with
models that predict little mass in the unshocked ejecta we need the ejecta to
be very clumped, or the temperature in the cold gas to be low ($\sim10$ K).
Both conditions can jointly contribute to the high absorption.

static analysis as part of the development process. However, static analysis
code itself is also prone to bugs. To ensure a consistent level of precision,
as analyzed programs grow more complex, a static analysis has to handle more
code constructs, frameworks, and libraries that the programs use. While more
complex analyses are written and used in production systems every day, the cost
of debugging and fixing them also increases tremendously.
  To better understand the difficulties of debugging static analyses, we
surveyed 115 static analysis writers. From their responses, we extracted the
core requirements to build a debugger for static analysis, which revolve around
two main issues: (1) abstracting from two code bases at the same time (the
analysis code and the analyzed code) and (2) tracking the analysis internal
state throughout both code bases. Most current debugging tools that our survey
participants use lack the capabilities to address both issues.
  Focusing on those requirements, we introduce VisuFlow, a debugging
environment for static data-flow analysis that is integrated in the Eclipse
development environment. VisuFlow features graph visualizations that enable
users to view the state of a data-flow analysis and its intermediate results at
any time. Special breakpoints in VisuFlow help users step through the analysis

we have conducted a user study on 20 static analysis writers. Using VisuFlow

scientific topic? What sort of social restructuring occurs as a new field

evolution of co-authorship networks associated with several fields of science,
each noting a characteristic shift in network structure as fields develop.
Historically, however, such studies have tended to rely on manually annotated
datasets and therefore only consider a handful of disciplines, calling into
question the universality of the observed structural signature.To overcome this
limitation and test the robustness of this phenomenon, we use a comprehensive
dataset of over 189,000 scientific articles and develop a framework for
partitioning articles and their authors into coherent, semantically-related
groups representing scientific fields of varying size and specificity. We then
use the resulting population of fields to study the structure of evolving
co-authorship networks. Consistent with earlier findings, we observe a global
topological transition as the co-authorship networks coalesce from a disjointed
aggregate into a dense giant connected component that dominates the network. We
validate these results using a separate, complimentary corpus of scientific
articles, and, overall, we find that the previously reported characteristic
structural evolution of a scientific field's associated co-authorship network
is robust across a large number of scientific fields of varying size, scope,

used in other scientometric contexts in order to extend studies to compare
across a larger range of scientific disciplines.

well-established in biochemistry, and was primarily constructed to describe
dilute aqueous solutions. Accordingly, few computational approaches have been
developed for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities in
environments other than dilute isotropic solution. Existing techniques, ranging
from simple automated docking procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based
methods, have been developed with soluble proteins in mind. Biologically and
pharmacologically relevant protein-ligand interactions often occur in complex
environments, including lamellar phases like membranes and crowded, non-dilute
solutions. Here we revisit the theoretical bases of ligand binding equilibria,
avoiding overly specific assumptions that are nearly always made when
describing receptor-ligand binding. Building on this formalism, we extend the
asymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation technique to
quantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including
phase-separated, anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a
thermodynamically consistent and easily generalized approach that resolves
several ambiguities of current frameworks. To incorporate the complex bulk
without overcomplicating the overall thermodynamic cycle, we simplify the
common approach for ligand restraints by using a single
distance-from-bound-configuration (DBC) ligand restraint during AFEP decoupling
from protein. DBC restraints should be generalizable to binding modes of most
small molecules, even those with strong orientational dependence. We apply this
approach to compute the likelihood that membrane cholesterol binds to known
crystallographic sites on 3 GPCRs at a range of concentrations. Non-ideality of
cholesterol in a binary cholesterol:POPC bilayer is characterized and
consistently incorporated into the interpretation.

star cluster of $N$-'point' stars have been conventionally discussed based on
either of collision kinetic theory (for strong two-body encounters) and wave
one (for statistical acceleration and gravitational polarization). If combining
the both theories together, one must introduce a self-consistent 'truncated'
Newtonian mean-field (m.f.) acceleration of star at position $r$ and time $t$
due to a phase-space distribution function $f\left(r', p',t\right)$ for stars
$A^{\triangle}(r,t)=-Gm\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)\int_{\mid r-r' \mid >
\triangle}\frac{r-r'}{\mid r-r' \mid^{3}}
f\left(r',p',t\right)\text{d}^{3}{r'}\text{d}^{3}{p'},$ where $G$ is the
gravitational constant and $m$ the mass of stars. The lower limit $\triangle$
of the distance between two stars is order of the Landau distance. The
truncated m.f. acceleration is a necessary consequence due to the strong
encounters and m.f. acceleration being not able to 'coexist' at specific
distance between stars.
  The present paper aims at initiating a star-cluster convergent kinetic theory
to self-consistently derive kinetic equations of star clusters, mathematically
non-divergent in distance- and wavenumber- spaces based on the truncated m.f.
acceleration, correct at time scales of the secular evolution. This will be
achieved by focusing on mathematical formulations of the Kandrup's
generalised-Landau equation including the effect of the strong encounters and
by extending the Grad's truncated distribution function and Klimontovich's
theory of non-ideal systems.

workflows that the different model types manifest and exert their scientific
usefulness by enhancing and extending different forms and degrees of
explanation. The process starts with knowledge about the phenomenon and
continues with explanatory and mathematical descriptions. Those descriptions
are transformed into software and used to perform experimental explorations by
running and examining simulation output. The credibility of inferences is thus
linked to having easy access to the scientific and technical provenance from
each workflow stage.

recent determinations of the ionizing emissivity due to stars and AGN, as well
as of the HI absorber column density distribution. Another major improvement is
a new treatment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) opacity for ionizing photons
that is able to consistently capture the transition from a neutral to an
ionized IGM. Previous synthesis models of the UVB, when used in simulations,
yield reionization and thermal histories that are inconsistent with the assumed
ionizing emissivities. With our new treatment, this discrepancy is fully
resolved. In our fiducial model, galaxies leaking $\lesssim 18\%$ of their
Lyman continuum emission drive HI reionization, while AGN drive HeII
reionization (completing at $z \simeq 6.2$ and $2.8$ respectively). Due to the
limited time available for cooling between HI and HeII reionization, higher IGM
temperatures are predicted for late reionization scenarios. In our fiducial
model, the predicted temperatures agree well with observational constraints at
$z \lesssim 4$, while being slightly high compared to (somewhat uncertain) data
above that. Models with a larger contribution of AGN are instead disfavoured by
the temperature data, as well as by measurements of the HI and HeII
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest opacities. We also present ""equivalent-equilibrium""

of H-alpha emitting star-forming galaxies within narrow redshift slices at z =

high stellar masses (M/M_sol>2x10^10), where HiZELS selects galaxies close to
the so-called star-forming main sequence, the clustering strength is observed
to increase strongly with stellar mass (in line with the results of previous
studies of mass-selected galaxy samples) and also with SFR. These two
dependencies are shown to hold independently. At lower stellar masses, however,
where HiZELS probes high specific SFR galaxies, there is little or no
dependence of the clustering strength on stellar mass, but the dependence on
SFR remains: high-SFR low-mass galaxies are found in more massive dark matter
haloes than their lower SFR counterparts. We argue that this is due to
environmentally driven star formation in these systems. We apply the same
selection criteria to the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We
find that, in EAGLE, the high-SFR low-mass galaxies are central galaxies in
more massive dark matter haloes, in which the high SFRs are driven by a
(halo-driven) increased gas content.

Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey and NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) down to the
stellar-mass completeness limit, log M / Msun > 9.0 (9.5) at z = 1.0 (2.0). We
compare the SMFs for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the highest and
lowest environments using a density estimator based on the distance to the
galaxies' third-nearest neighbors. For star-forming galaxies, at all redshifts
there are only minor differences with environment in the shape of the SMF. For
quiescent galaxies, the SMF in the lowest densities shows no evolution with
redshift, other than an overall increase in number density (phi*) with time.
This suggests that the stellar-mass dependence of quenching in relatively
isolated galaxies is both universal and does not evolve strongly. While at z >~
1.5 the SMF of quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable in the highest and
lowest densities, at lower redshifts it shows a rapidly increasing number
density of lower-mass galaxies, log M / Msun ~= 9-10. We argue this evolution
can account for all the redshift evolution in the shape of the total
quiescent-galaxy SMF. This evolution in the quiescent-galaxy SMF at higher
redshift (z > 1) requires an environmental-quenching efficiency that decreases
with decreasing stellar mass at 0.5 < z < 1.5 or it would overproduce the
number of lower-mass quiescent galaxies in denser environments. This requires a
dominant environment process such as starvation combined with rapid gas
depletion and ejection at z > 0.5 - 1.0 for galaxies in our mass range. The
efficiency of this process decreases with redshift allowing other processes
(such as galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping) to become more
important at later times, z < 0.5.

black hole binaries (MBHBs) following galaxy mergers is unavoidable. Still, due
the complex physics governing the (hydro)dynamics of the post-merger dense
environment of stars and gas in galactic nuclei, the final fate of those MBHBs
is still unclear. In gas-rich environments, it is plausible that turbulence and
gravitational instabilities feed gas to the nucleus in the form of a series of
cold incoherent clumps, thus providing a way to exchange energy and angular
momentum between the MBHB and its surroundings. Within this context, we present
a suite of smoothed-particle-hydrodynamical models to study the evolution of a
sequence of near-radial turbulent gas clouds as they infall towards equal-mass,
circular MBHBs. We focus on the dynamical response of the binary orbit to
different levels of anisotropy of the incoherent accretion events. Compared to
a model extrapolated from a set of individual cloud-MBHB interactions, we find
that accretion increases considerably and the binary evolution is faster. This
occurs because the continuous infall of clouds drags inwards circumbinary gas
left behind by previous accretion events, thus promoting a more effective
exchange of angular momentum between the MBHB and the gas. These results
suggest that sub-parsec MBHBs efficiently evolve towards coalescence during the
interaction with a sequence of individual gas pockets.

our model is more flexible, and capable of providing constraints on the main

compact sources, most of which are smaller than 5000 AU. By ruling out
alternative possibilities, we conclude that these sources consist of a mix of
hypercompact HII regions and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the
newly-detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes which, based on their
luminosities, must contain objects with stellar masses $M_*\gtrsim8$ M$_\odot$.
Their spatial distribution spread over a $\sim12\times3$ pc region demonstrates
that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended star formation event, not just an
isolated `starburst' within the protocluster regions. Using this new sample, we
examine star formation thresholds and surface density relations in Sgr B2.
While all of the YSOs reside in regions of high column density
($N(H_2)\gtrsim2\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), not all regions of high column
density contain YSOs. The observed column density threshold for star formation
is substantially higher than that in solar vicinity clouds, implying either
that high-mass star formation requires a higher column density or that any star
formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in nearby clouds. The
relation between the surface density of gas and stars is incompatible with
extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar densities in Sgr B2
follow a linear $\Sigma_*-\Sigma_{gas}$ relation, shallower than that observed
in local clouds. Together, these points suggest that a higher volume density
threshold is required to explain star formation in CMZ clouds.

Assuming that a majority of the electrons in the emitting region are

be $E\gtrsim 20$ GeV and that the Lorentz factor of the emitting material has
to be very large $10^3\lesssim \Gamma_{\rm em} \lesssim 10^4$, well in excess
of the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet inferred from GRB afterglows. A number of

relativistically, with $\Gamma'\approx 10$, relative to the bulk frame of the
jet and that the jet must be highly magnetized upstream of the emission region,
$\sigma_{\rm up}\gtrsim 30$. The emission radius is also strongly constrained
in this model to $R\gtrsim 10^{16}$cm. These values are consistent with
magnetic jet models where the dissipation is driven by magnetic reconnection

characterize Galactic dust emission as a foreground to the CMB polarization. We
present Planck EE, BB, and TE power spectra of dust polarization at 353 GHz for
six nested sky regions covering from 24 to 71 % of the sky. We present
power-law fits to the angular power spectra, yielding evidence for
statistically significant variations of the exponents over sky regions and a
difference between the values for the EE and BB spectra. The TE correlation and
E/B power asymmetry extend to low multipoles that were not included in earlier
Planck polarization papers. We also report evidence for a positive TB dust
signal. Combining data from Planck and WMAP, we determine the amplitudes and
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of polarized foregrounds, including the
correlation between dust and synchrotron polarized emission, for the six sky
regions as a function of multipole. This quantifies the challenge of the
component separation procedure required for detecting the reionization and
recombination peaks of primordial CMB B modes. The SED of polarized dust
emission is fit well by a single-temperature modified blackbody emission law
from 353 GHz to below 70 GHz. For a dust temperature of 19.6 K, the mean
spectral index for dust polarization is $\beta_{\rm d}^{P} = 1.53\pm0.02 $. By
fitting multi-frequency cross-spectra, we examine the correlation of the dust
polarization maps across frequency. We find no evidence for decorrelation. If
the Planck limit for the largest sky region applies to the smaller sky regions
observed by sub-orbital experiments, then decorrelation might not be a problem
for CMB experiments aiming at a primordial B-mode detection limit on the

oscillation, neutrinoless double beta decay and CMB observations. Our major
goal is to carefully investigate the possibility to single out one neutrino
mass ordering, Normal Ordering or Inverted Ordering, with current data. Two
possible parametrizations (three neutrino masses versus the lightest neutrino
mass plus the two oscillation mass splittings) and priors (linear versus
logarithmic) are examined. We find that the preference for NO is only driven by
neutrino oscillation data. Moreover, the values of the Bayes factor indicate
that the evidence for NO is strong only when the scan is performed over the
three neutrino masses with logarithmic priors; for every other combination of
parameterization and prior, the preference for NO is only weak. As a by-product
of our Bayesian analyses, we are able to a) compare the Bayesian bounds on the
neutrino mixing parameters to those obtained by means of frequentist
approaches, finding a very good agreement; b) determine that the lightest
neutrino mass plus the two mass splittings parametrization, motivated by the
physical observables, is strongly preferred over the three neutrino mass
eigenstates scan and c) find that there is a weak-to-moderate preference for
logarithmic priors. These results establish the optimal strategy to
successfully explore the neutrino parameter space, based on the use of the
oscillation mass splittings and a logarithmic prior on the lightest neutrino
mass. We also show that the limits on the total neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ can
change dramatically when moving from one prior to the other. These results have
profound implications for future studies on the neutrino mass ordering, as they
crucially state the need for self-consistent analyses which explore the best
parametrization and priors, without combining results that involve different

Our
analysis is carried out for several popular models including: Higgs inflation,
Starobinsky inflation, chaotic inflation, axion monodromy inflation and
non-canonical inflation. In each case we determine the set of initial
conditions which give rise to sufficient inflation, with at least $60$
e-foldings. A phase-space analysis has been performed for each of these models
and the effect of the initial inflationary energy scale on inflation has been
studied numerically. This paper discusses two scenarios of Higgs inflation: (i)
the Higgs is coupled to the scalar curvature, (ii) the Higgs Lagrangian
contains a non-canonical kinetic term. In both cases we find Higgs inflation to
be very robust since it can arise for a large class of initial conditions. One
of the central results of our analysis is that, for plateau-like potentials
associated with the Higgs and Starobinsky models, inflation can be realised
even for initial scalar field values which lie close to the minimum of the
potential. This dispels a misconception relating to plateau potentials
prevailing in the literature. We also find that inflation in all models is more
robust for larger values of the initial energy scale.

characterized by a single detection completeness, we extract an ensemble
completeness function that recovers the M dwarf planet detections from previous
work. We employ this completeness function, together with a dual-population
planet occurrence model that includes compact multiple planetary systems, to
infer anew the planet yield. We predict both the number of M dwarf planets
likely from TESS and their system architectures. We report four main findings:
first, that TESS will likely detect more planets orbiting M dwarfs that
previously predicted. Around stars with spectral types between M1V--M4V, we
predict TESS will find 990$\pm$350 planets orbiting 715$\pm$255 stars, a
1.5-fold increase over previous predictions. Secondly, TESS will find two or
more transiting planets around 20% of these host stars, a number similar to the
multiplicity yield of NASA's Kepler mission. Thirdly, TESS light curves in
which one or more planets are detected will often contain transits of
additional planets below the detection threshold of TESS. Among a typical set
of 200 TESS hosts to one or more detected planets, 116$\pm$28 transiting
planets will be missed. Transit follow-up efforts with the photometric
sensitivity to detect an Earth or larger around a mid-M dwarf, even with very
modest period completeness, will readily result in additional planet
discoveries. And fourth, the strong preference of TESS for systems of compact
multiples indicates that TESS planets will be dynamically cooler on average
than Kepler planets, with 90% of TESS-detected planets residing in orbits with
$e<0.15$.

peculiar motion of galaxies, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD). While
all the effects in RSD are accounted for by the simple mapping formula from
real to redshift spaces, accurately modeling redshift-space power spectrum is
rather difficult due to the non-perturbative properties of the mapping. Still,
however, a perturbative treatment may be applied to the power spectrum at
large-scales, and on top of a careful modeling of the Finger-of-God effect
caused by the small-scale random motion, the redshift-space power spectrum can
be expressed as a series of expansion which contains the higher-order
correlations of density and velocity fields. In our previous work [JCAP 8
(Aug., 2016) 050], we provide a perturbation-theory inspired model for power
spectrum in which the higher-order correlations are evaluated directly from the
cosmological $N$-body simulations. Adopting a simple Gaussian ansatz for
Finger-of-God effect, the model is shown to quantitatively describe the
simulation results. Here, we further push this approach, and present an
accurate power spectrum template which can be used to estimate the growth of
structure as a key to probe gravity on cosmological scales. Based on the
simulations, we first calibrate the uncertainties and systematics in the
pertrubation theory calculation in a fiducial cosmological model. Then, using
the scaling relations, the calibrated power spectrum template is applied to a
different cosmological model. We demonstrate that with our new template, the
best-fitted growth functions are shown to reproduce the fiducial values in a
good accuracy of 1 \% at $k<0.18 \hompc$ for cosmologies with different Hubble
parameters.

($M_{\bullet}$) and host galaxy properties (stellar mass, $M_{\star}$, and
velocity dispersion, $\sigma$), provide a link between the growth of black
holes (BHs) and that of their hosts. Here we investigate if and how the
BH-galaxy relations are established in the high-$z$ universe using
\textsc{BlueTides}, a high-resolution large volume cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation. We find the $M_{\bullet}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$
relations at $z=8$: $\log_{10}(M_{\bullet}) = 8.25 + 1.10 \
\log_{10}(M_{\star}/10^{11}M_{\odot})$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\bullet}) = 8.35 +
5.31 \ \log_{10}(\sigma/200kms^{-1})$ at $z=8$, both fully consistent with the
local measurements. The slope of the $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ relation is slightly
steeper for high star formation rate and $M_{\star}$ galaxies while it remains
unchanged as a function of Eddington accretion rate onto the BH. The intrinsic
scatter in $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ relation in all cases ($\epsilon \sim 0.4$) is
larger at these redshifts than inferred from observations and larger than in
$M_{\bullet}-M_{\star}$ relation ($\epsilon \sim 0.14$). We find the
gas-to-stellar ratio $f=M_{\rm gas}/M_{\star}$ in the host (which can be very
high at these redshifts) to have the most significant impact setting the
intrinsic scatter of $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$. The scatter is significantly reduced
when galaxies with high gas fractions ($\epsilon = 0.28$ as $f<10$) are
excluded (making the sample more comparable to low-$z$ galaxies); these systems
have the largest star formation rates and black hole accretion rates,
indicating that these fast-growing systems are still moving toward the relation
at these high redshifts. Examining the evolution (from $z=10$ to 8) of high
mass black holes in $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ plane confirms this trend.

star formation in dwarf galaxies is a key problem in galaxy formation. Using a
set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy embedded
in a $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ halo, we show that the momentum transferred from
resonantly scattered Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) photons is an important source of
stellar feedback which can shape the evolution of galaxies. We find that Lya
feedback suppresses star formation by a factor of two in metal-poor galaxies by
regulating the dynamics of star-forming clouds before the onset of supernova
explosions (SNe). This is possible because each Lya photon resonantly scatters
and imparts 10-300 times greater momentum than in the single scattering limit.
Consequently, the number of star clusters predicted in the simulations is
reduced by a factor of $\sim 5$, compared to the model without the early
feedback. More importantly, we find that galactic outflows become weaker in the
presence of strong Lya radiation feedback, as star formation and associated SNe
become less bursty. We also examine a model in which radiation field is
arbitrarily enhanced by a factor of up to 10, and reach the same conclusion.
The typical mass loading factors in our metal-poor dwarf system are estimated
to be $\sim5-10$ near the mid plane, while it is reduced to $\sim1$ at larger
radii. Finally, we find that the escape of ionizing radiation and hence the
reionization history of the Universe is unlikely to be strongly affected by Lya
feedback.

fast uplink grant and its advantages over conventional access schemes: i) fully
scheduled with RA process and ii) uncoordinated access, are presented. Then,
the key challenges that include the prediction of set of MTDs with data to
transmit, as well as the optimal scheduling of MTDs, are exposed. To overcome
these challenges, a two-stage approach that includes traffic prediction and
optimized scheduling is proposed. For this approach, various solutions for
source traffic prediction for periodic MTD traffic are reviewed and novel
methods for event-driven traffic prediction are proposed. For optimal
allocation of uplink grants, new solutions based on advanced machine learning
methods are presented. By using the proposed solutions, the fast uplink grant
has the potential to enable cellular networks to support massive MTCs and
effectively reduce the signaling overhead and overcome the delay and congestion

which can prevent IP piracy and illegal IC overproduction. It introduces
obfuscation by inserting some extra hardware into a design to hide its
functionality from unauthorized users. Correct functionality of an encrypted
design depends upon the application of correct keys, shared only with the
authorized users. In the recent past, extensive efforts have been devoted in
extracting the secret key of an encrypted design. At the same time, several
countermeasures have also been proposed by the research community to thwart
different state-of-the-art attacks on logic encryption. However, most of the
proposed countermeasures fail to prevent the powerful SAT attack. Although a
few researchers have proposed different solutions to withstand SAT attack,
those solutions suffer from several drawbacks such as high design overheads,
low output corruptibility, and vulnerability against removal attack. Almost all
the known logic encryption strategies are vulnerable to scan based attack. In
this paper, we propose a novel encryption technique called Encrypt Flip-Flop,
which encrypts the outputs of selected flip-flops by inserting multiplexers

New Radio (NR) is flexibility: flexible UL/DL allocation, bandwidths, or
scalable transmission time interval, and most importantly operation at
different frequency bands. In particular, 5G should exploit the spectral
opportunities in the unlicensed spectrum for expanding network capacity when
and where needed. However, unlicensed bands pose the challenge of ""coexisting
networks"", which mostly lack the means of communication for negotiation and
coordination. This deficiency is further exacerbated by the heterogeneity,
massive connectivity, and ubiquity of IoT systems and applications. Therefore,
5G needs to provide mechanisms to coexist and even converge in the unlicensed
bands. In that regard, WiFi, as the most prominent wireless technology in the
unlicensed bands, is both a key enabler for boosting 5G capacity and competitor
of 5G cellular networks for the shared unlicensed spectrum. In this work, we
describe spectrum sharing in 5G and present key coexistence solutions, mostly
in the context of WiFi. We also highlight the role of machine learning which is

studied in the Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$CrO$_3$ with $0 \leq x \leq 0.3$ compositions.
Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements show an increase of the
antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$) as Pr is substituted in the Y
sites and notable magnetic features are observed below $T_N$. Strong coupling
between magnetic and crystalline parameters is observed in a small range of Pr
compositions. A small perturbation in the lattice parameters by Pr ion is
sufficient to induce a spin reorientation transition followed by magnetization
reversal, to finally induce exchange bias effect. The spin reorientation
temperature ($T_{SR}$) is increased from 35 K to 149 K for $0.025 \leq x \leq
0.1$ compositions. It is found that the Cr spins sublattice rotates
continuously from $T_{SR}$ to a new spin configuration a lower temperature. In
addition, magnetization reversal is observed at $T^* \sim 35$ K for x= 0.05 up
to $T^* \sim 63$ K for x = 0.20 composition. The $M-H$ curves show negative
exchange bias effect induced by Pr ions, which are observed below of 100 K and
being more intense at 5 K. At 10 K, the magnetic contribution of the specific
heat, as well as the ZFC magnetization, show the rise of a peak with increasing
Pr content. The magnetic anomaly could be associated with the freezing of the
Pr magnetic moment randomly distributed at the 4c crystallographic site. A
clear correspondence between spin reorientation, magnetization reversal and
exchange bias anisotropy with the tilting and octahedral distortion is also

  Functional Connectivity","19 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Functional subnetwork extraction is commonly used to explore the brain's
modular structure. However, reliable subnetwork extraction from functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains challenging due to the
pronounced noise in neuroimaging data. In this paper, we proposed a high order
relation informed approach based on hypergraph to combine the information from
multi-task data and resting state data to improve subnetwork extraction. Our
assumption is that task data can be beneficial for the subnetwork extraction
process, since the repeatedly activated nodes involved in diverse tasks might
be the canonical network components which comprise pre-existing repertoires of
resting state subnetworks. Our proposed high order relation informed subnetwork
extraction based on a strength information embedded hypergraph, (1) facilitates
the multisource integration for subnetwork extraction, (2) utilizes information
on relationships and changes between the nodes across different tasks, and (3)
enables the study on higher order relations among brain network nodes. On real
data, we demonstrated that fusing task activation, task-induced connectivity
and resting state functional connectivity based on hypergraphs improves
subnetwork extraction compared to employing a single source from either rest or
task data in terms of subnetwork modularity measure, inter-subject
reproducibility, along with more biologically meaningful subnetwork
assignments.

(stationary and advancing) fractures along bi-material interfaces in layered

distribution of (elastic) stiffness $\boldsymbol{K}$ which is a-priori unknown.
The proposed imaging functional takes advantage of sequential wavefield
measurements for non-iterative and concurrent reconstruction of multiple
fractures in heterogeneous domains, with an exceptional spatial resolution and
with minimal sensitivity to measurement errors and uncertain elasticity of
damage zones. This is accomplished through adaptation of the
$F_\sharp$-factorization method (FM) applied to elastodynamic wavefields in a
sensing sequence i.e. a measurement campaign performed before and after the
formation (or evolution) of interfacial fractures. The direct scattering
problem is formulated in the frequency domain where the damage support is
illuminated by a set of incident P- and S-waves, and thus-induced scattered
waves are monitored at the far field. In this setting, the germane mixed
reciprocity principle is introduced, and $F_\sharp$-factorization of the
differential scattering operator is rigorously established for composite
backgrounds. These results lead to the development of an FM-based fracture
indicator whose affiliated cost functional is inherently convex, thus, its
minimizer can be computed without iterations. This attribute coupled with the
reduced sampling space, proposed in this work, remarkably expedite the data
inversion process. The performance of proposed imaging functional is
demonstrated by a set of numerical experiments.

applications, having additional semantic information per point has potential of

decade the use of Machine Learning and more specifically classification methods
have proved to be successful to create this semantic information. In this
paradigm, the goal is to classify points into a set of given classes (for
instance tree, building, ground, other). Some of these methods use descriptors
(also called feature) of a point to learn and predict its class. Designing the
descriptors is then the heart of these methods. Descriptors can be based on
points geometry and attributes, use contextual information, etc. Furthermore,
descriptors can be used by humans for easier visual understanding and sometimes
filtering. In this work we propose a new simple geometric descriptor that gives
information about the implicit local dimensionality of the point cloud at
various scale. For instance a tree seen from afar is more volumetric in nature
(3D), yet locally each leaves is rather planar (2D). To do so we build an
octree centred on the point to consider, and compare the variation of the
occupancy of the cells across the levels of the octree. We compare this
descriptor with the state of the art dimensionality descriptor and show its

that the network significantly outperforms the conventional region growing

in-depth interviews with older adults (65 and older) living in East York,
Toronto. We found Westin's typology to be a useful starting point for
understanding privacy attitudes and concerns in this demographic. We expand
Westin's typology and distinguish five categories: fundamentalist, intense
pragmatist, relaxed pragmatist, marginally concerned, and cynical expert. We
find that older adults are not a homogenous group composed of privacy
fundamentalists; rather, there is considerable variability in terms of their
privacy attitudes, with only 13 per cent being fundamentalists. We also
identify a group of cynical experts who believe that online privacy breaches
are inevitable. A large majority of older adults are marginally concerned, as
they see their online participation as limited and harmless. Older adults were
also grouped as either intense or relaxed pragmatists. We find that some
privacy concerns are shared by older adults across several categories, the most
common being spam, unauthorized access to personal information, and information
misuse. We discuss theoretical implications based on the findings for our

hexagonal boron nitride and some metal dichalcogenides: molybdenium disulfide
(MoS$_2$), tungsten selenium (WSe$_2$), and niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$). We
first find their arithmetic symmetries by using the theory of monoatomic and
diatomic 2-nets. Then, by confinement to weak transformation neighbourhoods and
by applying the Cauchy-Born rule we are able to use the symmetries continuum
mechanics utilizes: geometric symmetries. We give the complete and irreducible
representation for energies depending on an in-plane measure, the curvature
tensor and the shift vector. This is done for the symmetry hierarchies that
describe how symmetry changes at the continuum level: $\mathcal C_{6 \nu}
\rightarrow \mathcal C_{2 \nu} \rightarrow \mathcal C_1$ for monoatomic 2-nets
and $\mathcal C_{6 \nu} \rightarrow \mathcal C_{1 \nu} \rightarrow \mathcal
C_1$ for diatomic two nets. Having these energies at hand we are able to
evaluate stresses and couple stresses for each symmetry regime.

(FJ) with interfaces, supporting multiple inheritance in a restricted form,
$\lambda$-expressions, and intersection types. Our main goal is to formalise
how lambdas and intersection types are grafted on Java 8, by studying their
properties in a formal setting. We show how intersection types play a
significant role in several cases, in particular in the typecast of a
$\lambda$-expression and in the typing of conditional expressions. We also
embody interface \emph{default methods} in FJ&$\lambda$, since they increase
the dynamism of $\lambda$-expressions, by allowing these methods to be called
on $\lambda$-expressions.
  The crucial point in Java 8 and in our calculus is that $\lambda$-expressions
can have various types according to the context requirements (target types):
indeed, Java code does not compile when $\lambda$-expressions come without
target types. In particular, in the operational semantics we must record target
types by decorating $\lambda$-expressions, otherwise they would be lost in the
runtime expressions.
  We prove the subject reduction property and progress for the resulting
calculus, and we give a type inference algorithm that returns the type of a
given program if it is well typed. The design of FJ&$\lambda$ has been driven
by the aim of making it a subset of Java 8, while preserving the elegance and
compactness of FJ. Indeed, FJ&$\lambda$ programs are typed and behave the same
as Java programs.

our ability to predict toxicity. The first section provides a brief history of
empirical observations on toxicity dating back to the dawn of Sumerian
civilization. Interestingly, the concept of dose emerged very early on, leading
up to the modern emphasis on kinetic properties, which in turn encodes the
insight that toxicity is not solely a property of a compound but instead
depends on the interaction with the host organism. The next logical step is the
current conception of evaluating drugs from a personalized medicine
point-of-view. We review recent work on integrating what could be referred to
as classical pharmacokinetic analysis with emerging systems biology approaches
incorporating multiple omics data. These systems approaches employ advanced
statistical analytical data processing complemented with machine learning
techniques and use both pharmacokinetic and omics data. We find that such
integrated approaches not only provide improved predictions of toxicity but
also enable mechanistic interpretations of the molecular mechanisms
underpinning toxicity and drug resistance. We conclude the chapter by
discussing some of the main challenges, such as how to balance the inherent
tension between the predictive capacity of models, which in practice amounts to
constraining the number of features in the models versus allowing for rich
mechanistic interpretability, i.e. equipping models with numerous molecular
features. This challenge also requires patient-specific predictions on
toxicity, which in turn requires proper stratification of patients as regards
how they respond, with or without adverse toxic effects. In summary, the
transformation of the ancient concept of dose is currently successfully
operationalized using rich integrative data encoded in patient-specific models.

dimensional 2-lattice, requires specification of the components of the shift
vector that acts as an auxiliary variable. If only in-plane motions are
considered the energy depends on an in-plane strain measure and the shift
vector. The assumption of geometrical and material linearity leads to quadratic
energy terms with respect to the shift vector, the strain tensor, and their
combinations. Graphene's hexagonal symmetry reduces the number of independent
moduli then to four. We evaluate these four material parameters using molecular
calculations and the AIREBO potential and compare them with standard linear

evaluate new protocols for key-value stores and compare them with existing
protocols based on selected benchmarks. Due to limitations of CAP theorem, new
protocols must be developed that achieve the desired trade-off between
consistency and availability for the given application at hand. Hence, both
academic and industrial communities focus on developing new protocols that
identify a different (and hopefully better in one or more aspect) point on this
trade-off curve. While these protocols are often based on a simple intuition,
evaluating them to ensure that they indeed provide increased availability,
consistency, or performance is a tedious task. Our framework, DKVF, enables one
to quickly prototype a new protocol as well as identify how it performs
compared to existing protocols for pre-specified benchmarks. Our framework
relies on YCSB (Yahoo! Cloud Servicing Benchmark) for benchmarking. We
demonstrate DKVF by implementing four existing protocols --eventual
consistency, COPS, GentleRain and CausalSpartan-- with it. We compare the
performance of these protocols against different loading conditions. We find
that the performance is similar to our implementation of these protocols from
scratch. And, the comparison of these protocols is consistent with what has
been reported in the literature. Moreover, implementation of these protocols
was much more natural as we only needed to translate the pseudocode into Java
(and add the necessary error handling). Hence, it was possible to achieve this
in just 1-2 days per protocol. Finally, our framework is extensible. It is
possible to replace individual components in the framework (e.g., the storage
component).

mechanics including the study of composite materials. Here, we analytically
study an arbitrarily-shaped isotropic inhomogeneity embedded in a finite-sized
heterogeneous medium. By modal decomposition of the influence of the
inhomogeneity on the deformation of the composite, a relation is presented that
determines the variation of effective elastic stiffness caused by the presence
of the inhomogeneity. This relation indicates that the effective elastic
stiffness of a composite is always a concave function of the properties of the
inhomogeneity, embedded inside the composite. Therefore, as the heterogeneity
of elastic random composites increases, the rate of increase in effective
stiffness caused by the stiffer constituents is smaller than the rate of its
decrease due to the softer constitutions. So, weakly heterogeneous random
composites become softer and less conductive with increasing heterogeneity at
the same mean of constituent properties. We numerically evaluated the effective
properties of about ten thousand composites to empirically support these
results and extend them to conductive materials. This article presents a
generalization of our recent theoretical study on the influence of the
stiffness of a single fiber on the elastic stiffness of a network of fibers to
arbitrarily-shaped inhomogeneities and different transport phenomena.

standard siren data without redshift measurements to constrain cosmological
parameters. With successful detections of gravitational wave (GW) signals an
era of GW astronomy has begun. Unlike the electromagnetic domain, GW signals
allow direct measurements of luminosity distances to the sources, while their
redshifts remain to be measured by identifying electromagnetic counterparts.
This leads to significant technical problems for almost all possible BH-BH
systems. It is the major obstacle to cosmological applications of GW standard
sirens. In this paper, we introduce the general framework of using luminosity
distances alone for cosmological inference. The idea is to use the prior
knowledge of the redshift probability distribution for coalescing sources from
the intrinsic merger rates assessed with population synthesis codes. Then the
posterior probability distributions for cosmological parameters can be
calculated. We demonstrate the performance of our method on the simulated mock
data and show that the luminosity distance measurement would enable an accurate
determination of cosmological parameters up to $20%$ uncertainty level. We also

H$_p$ (peak field of SMP in $M(H)$), which is likely to be related with a
vortex-lattice structural phase transition, as suggested in literature for
similar sample. In addition, the magnetic relaxation measured for magnetic
fields near H$_{spt}$ show some noise which might be the signature of the
structural phase transition of the vortex lattice. Analysis of the magnetic
relaxation data using Maley's criterion and the collective pinning theory
suggests that the second magnetization peak (SMP) in the sample is due to the
collective (elastic) to plastic creep crossover, which is also accompanied with
a rhombic to square vortex lattice phase transition. Analysis of the pinning
force density suggests single dominating pinning mechanism in the sample and is
not showing the usual $\delta$l and $\delta T_c$ nature of pinning. The
critical current density ($J_c$) estimated using the Bean's critical state

recognize where they are on the return journey typically without needing to
look in their rear-view mirror or turn around to look back, despite significant
viewpoint and appearance change. Such navigation capabilities are typically
attributed to our semantic visual understanding of the environment [1] beyond
geometry to recognizing the types of places we are passing through such as
""passing a shop on the left"" or ""moving through a forested area"". Humans are in
effect using place categorization [2] to perform specific place recognition
even when the viewpoint is 180 degrees reversed. Recent advances in deep neural
networks have enabled high-performance semantic understanding of visual places
and scenes, opening up the possibility of emulating what humans do. In this
work, we develop a novel methodology for using the semantics-aware higher-order
layers of deep neural networks for recognizing specific places from within a
reference database. To further improve the robustness to appearance change, we
develop a descriptor normalization scheme that builds on the success of
normalization schemes for pure appearance-based techniques such as SeqSLAM [3].
Using two different datasets - one road-based, one pedestrian-based, we
evaluate the performance of the system in performing place recognition on
reverse traversals of a route with a limited field of view camera and no
turn-back-and-look behaviours, and compare to existing state-of-the-art
techniques and vanilla off-the-shelf features. The results demonstrate
significant improvements over the existing state of the art, especially for
extreme perceptual challenges that involve both great viewpoint change and
environmental appearance change. We also provide experimental analyses of the

between the short time measurement and the sparse spectrum. Based on the
relationship and the Lp-quasinorm feasible domain, the proposed model is
established. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted

approach. It is found that the quintuple-peak features of the light curve
provide tight constraints on the source trajectory, enabling us to precisely
and accurately measure the microlensing parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$. Furthermore,
the three resolved caustics allow us to measure the angular Einstein radius
$\thetae$. From the combination of $\pi_{\rm E}$ and $\thetae$, the physical
lens parameters are uniquely determined. It is found that the lens is a binary
composed of two M dwarfs with masses $M_1 = 0.52 \pm 0.04\ M_\odot$ and
$M_2=0.42 \pm 0.03\ M_\odot$ separated in projection by $a_\perp = 6.4 \pm 0.5$

are trained. Furthermore, this data is used for various kinds of spatial and

then they are statistically validated with existing widely adopted rankings.
Traffic perception depicts the attitude and perception of people towards the
traffic.
  It is also seen that traffic related data when visualized spatially and
temporally provides the same pattern as the actual traffic flows for various
urban areas. When visualized at the city level, it is clearly visible that the
flow of tweets is similar to flow of vehicles and that the traffic related

embedded in a (Zn,Mn)Se matrix only the holes are confined in the QDs.
Photoexcitation with photon energy 3.06 eV (2.54 eV) generates electron-hole

(PL) at 7 K in the presence of an external magnetic field exhibits an up to

should be mentioned that our method is not limited to SLMs and can be easily
applied on other devices. Thus we believe that our proposal provides another
option to perform linear operation with a simple, fixed, error-tolerant and

Engine-relevant simulation cases for two different fuels were defined. Analyses

strong expansion and the mixing of the fuel with the chamber gas. A comparison

a completely different penetration depth in contrast to single-phase injection

in which a puncturing pattern $\pv^{N}=(p_0,...,p_N)$ is applied to a
length-$N$ polar code.. We first introduce two virtual channels to
stochastically model the punctured (untransmitted) bits, which are respectively
called {\em useless channel model} (UCM) and {\em deterministic channel model}
(DCM). Under each model, we derive boolean functions in variables
$p_0,...,p_{N-1}$ that can indicate which polarized channels should carry
frozen bits. Based on this, we present an efficient method to jointly optimize
a puncturing pattern and an information set. Focusing on a fixed information
set, we show that there exist the so-called {\em catastrophic} puncturing
patterns that will surely lead to a block error and derive their weight
distributions recursively. We then propose the two construction methods of a
rate-compatible (RC) polar code which ensures that each puncturing pattern in
the family is non-catastrophic. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed RC polar code outperform the RC Turbo code adopted in LTE.

access networks (CRANs) in which multiple radio remote heads (RRHs) are
connected to a central computing unit known as the cloud. The transmit frame of
each RRH consists of multiple radio resources blocks (RRBs), and the cloud is
responsible for synchronizing these RRBS and scheduling them to users. Unlike
previous works that consider allocating each RRB to only a single user at each
time instance, this paper proposes to mix the flows of multiple users in each
RRB using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). The proposed scheme is
thus designed to jointly schedule the users to different RRBs, choose the
encoded file sent in each of them, and the rate at which each of them is
transmitted. Hence, the paper maximizes the throughput which is defined as the
number of correctly received bits. To jointly fulfill this objective, we design
a graph in which each vertex represents a possible user-RRB association,
encoded file, and transmission rate. By appropriately choosing the weights of
vertices, the scheduling problem is shown to be equivalent to a maximum weight
clique problem over the newly introduced graph. Simulation results illustrate
the significant gains of the proposed scheme compared to classical coding and
uncoded solutions.

vibration (VIV) on a side-by-side (SBS) arrangement of two circular cylinders
is numerically investigated at moderate Reynolds number 100 < Re < 800. Of
particular interest is to establish a relationship between the VIV, the gap
flow and the near-wake instability behind bluff bodies. We find that the
kinematics of the VIV regulates the streamwise vorticity concentration, which
accompanies with a recovery of two-dimensional hydrodynamic responses at the
peak lock-in stage. On the other hand, the near-wake instability may develop
around an in-determinant two-dimensional streamline saddle point along the
interfaces of a pair of imbalanced counter-signed vorticity clusters. The
vorticity concentration difference of adjacent vorticity clusters and the fluid
momentum are closely interlinked with the prominence of streamwise vortical
structures. In both SSBS and VSBS arrangements, the flip-flopping frequency is
significantly low for the three-dimensional flow, except at the VIV lock-in
stage for the VSBS arrangement. A quasi-stable deflected gap flow regime with
negligible spanwise hydrodynamic (i.e., two-dimensional) response is found at
the peak lock-in stage of VSBS arrangements. Owing to the gap-flow proximity
interference, a high streamwise vorticity concentration is observed in its
narrow near-wake region. The increase of the gap-flow proximity interference
tends to stabilize the VIV lock-in, which eventually amplifies the spanwise
correlation length and weakens the streamwise vortical structures. We employ
the dynamic mode decomposition procedure to characterize the space-time
evolution of the primary vortex wake.

enhance the connection between the CIV blueshift and quasar properties (e.g.,
EW). The variability of the MgII line center (i.e., the wavelength that bisects

equations for solid and fluid in isotropic tight oil/gas sandstone media
through volume averaging theorems (VAT). Based on the features of the media,
four physical assumptions are proposed as the foundation for our derivation.
More precisely, volume averaging theorems are applied to the micro-scale motion
equations for both the solid and the fluid as well as to the stress-strain
relations, resulting in a combined system of macro-scale equations for the
tight oil/gas sandstone media. It is worth noting that the four assumptions may
not be satisfied in the whole region. Nevertheless, since the characteristic
diameter for applying VAT ranges between $10^{-6}$ meters and dozens of meters,
we may split the entire domain into several sub-domains such that the four
physical assumptions are satisfied in each sub-domain. By choosing a proper
characteristic diameter of an averaging volume, we derive a formula for the
fluid average pressure in terms of the divergence of the average displacement
from the continuity equation of the fluid. As a result, the motion equations
derived in this paper are simpler than the Biot equations, and are more
suitable for inversion of porous medium parameters. When the fluid is gas and
the compressional wave is considered, the derived motion equations can be
simplified to the diffusive-viscous wave equation. Moreover, the explicit
relationship between the coefficients in this equation and medium parameters is
very important for gas detection in tight gas sandstone.

informativeness of an object hypothesis, which allow us to leverage active
learning to reduce the amount of annotated data needed to achieve a target
object detection performance. Our first metric measures 'localization
tightness' of an object hypothesis, which is based on the overlapping ratio
between the region proposal and the final prediction. Our second metric
measures 'localization stability' of an object hypothesis, which is based on
the variation of predicted object locations when input images are corrupted by
noise. Our experimental results show that by augmenting a conventional
active-learning algorithm designed for classification with the proposed
metrics, the amount of labeled training data required can be reduced up to 25%.
Moreover, on PASCAL 2007 and 2012 datasets our localization-stability method

disulfide monolayer, non-uniformity of the charge density distribution around
specific lattice sites on the surface of strongly correlated oxides, and
transition between different structural states of buckybowl molecules. We
further extended our method towards tracking, from one image frame to another,
minute distortions in the geometric shape of individual Si dumbbells in a
3-dimensional Si sample, which are associated with a motion of lattice defects
and impurities. Due the applicability of our framework to both scanning
tunneling microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy
measurements, it can provide a fast and straightforward way towards creating a
unified database of defect-property relationships from experimental data for
each material.

  Variance Shift","9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper first answers the question ""why do the two most powerful
techniques Dropout and Batch Normalization (BN) often lead to a worse
performance when they are combined together?"" in both theoretical and
statistical aspects. Theoretically, we find that Dropout would shift the
variance of a specific neural unit when we transfer the state of that network
from train to test. However, BN would maintain its statistical variance, which
is accumulated from the entire learning procedure, in the test phase. The
inconsistency of that variance (we name this scheme as ""variance shift"") causes
the unstable numerical behavior in inference that leads to more erroneous
predictions finally, when applying Dropout before BN. Thorough experiments on
DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and Wide ResNet confirm our findings. According to
the uncovered mechanism, we next explore several strategies that modifies
Dropout and try to overcome the limitations of their combination by avoiding
the variance shift risks.

The closed-form solution in each concentric layer is expressed in terms of a
suitably-defined inverse Laplace transform that can be evaluated numerically.

its discrete level structure, it is only sensitive to photons of certain

signal frequency and amplitude can be deduced from the higher level AC Stark
shift. The measurement accuracy is given by the signal amplitude, its detuning
from the discrete qudit energy level structure and the anharmonicity. We
demonstrate an energy sensitivity in the order of $10^{-3}$ with a measurement
range of more than $1\,\mathrm{GHz}$. Here, using a transmon qubit, we
experimentally observe shifts in the transition frequencies involving up to
three excited levels. These shifts are in good agreement with an analytic
circuit model and master equation simulations. For large detunings, we find the

  Convolutional Neural Network",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, research on decoding brain activity based on functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made remarkable achievements. However,
constraint-free natural image reconstruction from brain activity is still a
challenge. The existing methods simplified the problem by using semantic prior
information or just reconstructing simple images such as letters and digitals.
Without semantic prior information, we present a novel method to reconstruct
nature images from fMRI signals of human visual cortex based on the computation
model of convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, we extracted the units
output of viewed natural images in each layer of a pre-trained CNN as CNN
features. Secondly, we transformed image reconstruction from fMRI signals into
the problem of CNN feature visualizations by training a sparse linear
regression to map from the fMRI patterns to CNN features. By iteratively
optimization to find the matched image, whose CNN unit features become most
similar to those predicted from the brain activity, we finally achieved the
promising results for the challenging constraint-free natural image
reconstruction. As there was no use of semantic prior information of the
stimuli when training decoding model, any category of images (not constraint by
the training set) could be reconstructed theoretically. We found that the
reconstructed images resembled the natural stimuli, especially in position and
shape. The experimental results suggest that hierarchical visual features can
effectively express the visual perception process of human brain.

by means of a multiscale strategy based on computational homogenization of the
polycrystal aggregate. The mechanical behavior of each crystal is given by a
dislocation-based crystal plasticity model in which the critical resolved shear
stress follows the Taylor model. The generation and annihilation of
dislocations in each slip system during deformation is given by the
Kocks-Mecking model, which was modified to account for the dislocation storage
at the grain boundaries. Polycrystalline Cu is selected to validate the
simulation strategy and all the model parameters are obtained from dislocation
dynamics simulations or experiments at lower length scales and the simulation
results were in good agreement with experimental data in the literature. The
model is applied to explore the influence of different microstructural factors
(initial dislocation density, width of the grain size distribution, texture) on
the grain size effect. It is found that the initial dislocation density,
$\rho_i$, plays a dominant role in the magnitude of the grain size effect and
that dependence of flow stress with an inverse power of grain size ($\sigma_ y
-\sigma_\infty \propto d_g^{-x}$) breaks down for large initial dislocation
densities ($> 10^{14}$ m$^{-2}$) and grain sizes $d_g > $ 40 $\mu$m in FCC
metals. However, it was found that the grain size contribution to the strength
followed a power-law function of the dimensionless parameter $d_g\sqrt{\rho_i}$
for small values of the applied strain ($<$ 2 \%), in agreement with previous
theoretical considerations for size effects in plasticity.

that despite reducing the number of values that can be represented in the

areas often relies on experts painstakingly designing a network architecture
specific to each task. To simplify this process and make it more accessible, an
emerging research effort seeks to automate the design of neural network
architectures, using e.g. evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning or
simple search in a constrained space of neural modules.
  Considering the typical size of the search space (e.g. $10^{10}$ candidates
for a $10$-layer network) and the cost of evaluating a single candidate,
current architecture search methods are very restricted. They either rely on
static pre-built modules to be recombined for the task at hand, or they define
a static hand-crafted framework within which they can generate new
architectures from the simplest possible operations.
  In this paper, we relax these restrictions, by capitalizing on the collective
wisdom contained in the plethora of neural networks published in online code
repositories. Concretely, we (a) extract and publish GitGraph, a corpus of
neural architectures and their descriptions; (b) we create problem-specific
neural architecture search spaces, implemented as a textual search mechanism
over GitGraph; (c) we propose a method of identifying unique common subgraphs
within the architectures solving each problem (e.g., image processing,
reinforcement learning), that can then serve as modules in the newly created

$\Delta\omega\!\sim\!\sigma\,\omega\sqrt{n_q}/\sqrt{N}$, where $\sigma$ is the
strength of disorder and $N$ is the total number of particles. This theoretical
prediction is supported by extensive numerical calculations for disordered
lattices characterized by topological, mass, stiffness and positional disorder,
and for computer glasses, where disorder is self-generated, thus establishing
its universal nature. The predicted scaling leads to the identification of a
crossover frequency $\omega_\dagger\!\sim\!L^{-2/(d+2)}$ in systems of linear
size $L$ in $d\!>\!2$ dimensions, where the disorder-induced width of phonon
bands becomes comparable to the frequency gap between neighboring bands.
Consequently, phonons continuously cover the frequency range
$\omega\!>\!\omega_\dagger$, where the notion of discrete phonon bands becomes
ill-defined. Two basic applications of the theory are presented; first, we show
that the phonon scattering lifetime is proportional to $(\Delta\omega)^{-1}$
for $\omega\!<\!\omega_\dagger$. Second, the theory is applied to the basic
physics of glasses, allowing to determine the range of frequencies in which the
recently established universal density of states of non-phononic excitations
can be directly probed for different system sizes.

different signals and therefore their registration is challenging and it is not
solved by classic approaches. To that end, we developed a feature-based
approach that solves the visible (VIS) to Near-Infra-Red (NIR) registration
problem. Our algorithm detects corners by Harris and matches them by a
patch-metric learned on top of CIFAR-10 network descriptor. As our experiments

sub-pixel accuracy. Comparing to other existing methods, our approach is more

respect to state indices $n,l$, and with confinement radius ($r_c$) for the
latter. In a CHA, at small $r_{c}$, kinetic energy increases, whereas
$S_{\rvec}, R^{\alpha}_{\rvec}$ decrease with growth of $n$, signifying greater
localization in high-lying states. At moderate $r_{c}$, there exists an
interplay between two mutually opposing factors: (i) radial confinement
(localization) and (ii) accumulation of radial nodes with growth of $n$

models are obtained by discretization of partial differential equations using
the Finite Element (FE) or Finite Difference (FD) methods. The motivation for
studying this pressing problem originates from the fact that the classical
numerical tools used to solve low-dimensional optimal control problems are
computationally infeasible for large-scale systems. Furthermore, although the
matrices of large-scale FE or FD models are usually sparse banded or highly
structured, the optimal control solution computed using the classical methods
is dense and unstructured. Consequently, it is not suitable for efficient
centralized and distributed real-time implementations. We show that the a
priori (sparsity) patterns of the exact solutions of the generalized Lyapunov
equations for FE and FD models are banded matrices. The a priori pattern
predicts the dominant non-zero entries of the exact solution. We furthermore
show that for well-conditioned problems, the a priori patterns are not only
banded but also sparse matrices. On the basis of these results, we develop two
computationally efficient methods for computing sparse approximate solutions of
generalized Lyapunov equations. Using these two methods and the inexact Newton
method, we show that the solution of the generalized Riccati equation can be
approximated by a banded matrix. This enables us to develop a novel
computationally efficient optimal control approach that is able to preserve the
sparsity of the control law. We perform extensive numerical experiments that
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

this paper we propose MANN, a dynamic multiagent frequency reuse scheme, where
individual agents in charge of cells control their configurations based on

best action (i.e., cell configuration) for its current environment setup, and
attempts to maximise in turn a local metric, subject to the constraint imposed

wavelength $\lambdaM$ of electrons equals the laser wavelength $\lambda$. On
the contrary, by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of an argon

given laser pulse energy and a cluster, at each peak intensity there exists a
$\lambda$ -- shifted from the expected $\lambdaM$ -- that corresponds to a {\em

effective unification of possible resonances in various stages, including (i)
the LR in the initial time of plasma creation, (ii) the LR in the Coulomb
expanding phase in the later time and (iii) anharmonic resonance in the
marginally over-dense regime for a relatively longer pulse duration, leading to
maximum laser absorption accompanied by maximum removal of electrons from
cluster and also maximum allowed average charge states for the argon cluster.
Increasing the laser intensity, the absorption maxima is found to shift to a
higher wavelength in the band of $\lambda\approx (1-1.5)\lambdaM$ than
permanently staying at the expected $\lambdaM$. A naive rigid sphere model also
corroborates the wavelength shift of the absorption peak as found in MD and
un-equivocally proves that maximum laser absorption in a cluster happens at a

enable low complexity multi-user NOMA operations, a novel user grouping

($i\geq 76^{\circ}$), late-type spiral galaxies mostly at $1.4$ and 5 GHz,
observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, Very Large Array,
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, Effelsberg 100-m and Parkes 64-m
telescopes. All galaxies show clear evidence of radio haloes, including the
first detection in the Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 55. In 11 galaxies, we find a
thin and a thick disc that can be better fitted by exponential rather than
Gaussian functions. We fit our SPINNAKER (SPectral INdex Numerical Analysis of
K(c)osmic-ray Electron Radio-emission) 1D cosmic-ray transport models to the
vertical model profiles of the non-thermal intensity and to the non-thermal
radio spectral index in the halo. We simultaneously fit for the advection speed
(or diffusion coefficient) and magnetic field scale height. In the thick disc,
the magnetic field scale heights range from 2 to 8 kpc with an average across
the sample of $3.0\pm 1.7~\rm kpc$; they show no correlation with either
star-formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) or rotation
speed ($V_{\rm rot}$). The advection speeds range from 100 to $700~\rm
km\,s^{-1}$ and display correlations of $V\propto \rm SFR^{0.36\pm 0.06}$ and
$V\propto \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.39\pm 0.09}$; they agree remarkably well with the
escape velocities ($0.5\leq V/V_{\rm esc}\leq 2$), which can be explained by
cosmic-ray driven winds. Radio haloes show the presence of disc winds in
galaxies with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} > 10^{-3}~\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}$
that extend over several kpc and are driven by processes related to the
distributed star formation in the disc.

those with satellites) could form as a result of compression of parental
rarefied preplanetesimals. The formulas for calculating the angular momentum of
two colliding condensations with respect to their center of mass, which were
applied earlier in (Ipatov, 2010) in the comparison of such momenta with the
angular momenta of observed satellite systems, are used to estimate the angular
momenta of condensations needed to form satellite systems. It is demonstrated
that the angular velocities of condensations used in (Nesvorny et al., 2010) as
the initial data in the computer simulation of compression of rarefied
preplanetesimals and subsequent formation of trans-Neptunian satellite systems
may be obtained in collisions of preplanetesimals with their radii comparable
to the corresponding Hill radii. For example, these angular velocities are in
the range of possible values of angular velocities of a parental rarefied
preplanetesimal formed as a result of a merger of two colliding rarefied
preplanetesimals that moved in circular heliocentric orbits before a collision.
Some rarefied preplanetesimals formed as a result of collision of
preplanetesimals in the region of formation of solid small bodies acquire such
angular momenta that are sufficient to form satellite systems of small bodies.
It is likely that the ratio of the number of rarefied preplanetesimals with
such angular momenta to the total number of rarefied preplanetesimals producing
classical trans-Neptunian objects with diameters larger than 100 km was 0.45
(the initial fraction of satellite systems among all classical trans-Neptunian
objects).

walking into the next room to explore a museum evolve on the time scale of
seconds; in contrast, neuronal action potentials occur on the time scale of a
few milliseconds. Learning rules of the brain must therefore bridge the gap
between these two different time scales.
  Modern theories of synaptic plasticity have postulated that the co-activation
of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets a flag at the synapse, called an
eligibility trace, that leads to a weight change only if an additional factor
is present while the flag is set. This third factor, signaling reward,
punishment, surprise, or novelty, could be implemented by the phasic activity
of neuromodulators or specific neuronal inputs signaling special events. While
the theoretical framework has been developed over the last decades,
experimental evidence in support of eligibility traces on the time scale of
seconds has been collected only during the last few years.
  Here we review, in the context of three-factor rules of synaptic plasticity,
four key experiments that support the role of synaptic eligibility traces in
combination with a third factor as a biological implementation of neoHebbian
three-factor learning rules.

The pore fluid in the periodic structure can constitute a single connected
domain, or an array of inclusions. Also the conducting parts are represented by
several mutually separated connected domains, or by inclusions. Two of four
possible arrangements are considered for upscaling by the homogenization
method. The macroscopic model of the first type involves coefficients
responsible for interactions between the electric field and the pore pressure,
or the pore volume. For the second type, the electrodes can be used for
controlling the electric field at the pore level, so that the deformation and
the pore volume can be influenced locally. Effective constitutive coefficients
are computed using characteristic responses of the microstructure. The
two-scale modelling procedure is implemented numerically using the finite
element method. The macroscopic strain and electric fields are used to
reconstruct the corresponding local responses at the pore level. For validation
of the models, these are compared with results obtained by direct numerical
simulations of the heterogeneous structure; a good agreement is demonstrated,
showing relevance of the two-scale numerical modelling approach.

transformations in shape memory alloys, often look differently during cooling

critical exponents of energy and amplitude distributions (\epsilon and \alpha,
respectively) in acoustic emission measurements. It is illustrated that, in
accordance with empirical correlations, the above asymmetry of acoustic noises
can be classified into two groups: the relative changes of the exponents during
cooling and heating (\gamma \epsilon=(\epsilon h-\epsilon c)/\epsilon c as well

negative. For positive \gamma values the number of hits and the total energy of
acoustic emission are larger for cooling, and the situation is just the reverse
for negative asymmetry. Our interpretation is based on the different ways of
relaxation of the elastic strain energy during cooling as well as heating. It
is illustrated that if the relaxed fraction of the total elastic strain energy
(which would be stored without relaxations) during cooling is larger than the
corresponding relaxed fraction during heating, then the asymmetry is positive.
Magnetic emission noises, accompanied with martensitic phase transformations in
ferromagnetic alloys, show similar asymmetry than those observed for thermal

algorithms require extensive use of GPU computing and they hardly scale to
large environments; incremental algorithms from sparse points still represent
an effective solution when light computational effort is needed and big
sequences have to be processed in real-time. In this paper we improved and
extended the state of the art incremental manifold mesh algorithm proposed in

they embed points from SLAM or Structure from Motion only when their position

from 2003 to 2017. The data from 2003 to 2011 show coherent, long-lived
variations with a period of 702 d. These variations are consistent with the
presence of a planetary companion having m sin i = 10.7 M_Jup whose orbital
properties are typical for giant planets found around evolved stars. An
analysis of the Hipparcos photometry, Ca II S-index measurements, and
measurements of the spectral line shapes during this time show no variations
with the radial velocity of the planet which seems to ""confirm""' the presence
of the planet. However, radial velocity measurements taken 2011 -- 2017 seem to
refute this. From 2011 to 2013 the radial velocity variations virtually
disappear only to return in 2014, but with a noticeable phase shift. The total
radial velocity variations are consistent either with amplitude variations on
timescales of ~ 10.6 yr, or the beating effect between two periods of 666 d and
801 d. It seems unlikely that both these signals stem from a two-planet system.
A simple dynamical analysis indicates that there is only a 1-2 % chance that
the two-planet is stable. Rather, we suggest that this multi-periodic behavior
may represent a new form of stellar variability, possibly related to
oscillatory convective modes. If such intrinsic stellar variability is common
around K giant stars and is attributed to planetary companions, then the planet
occurrence rate among these stars may be significantly lower than thought.

areas such as image classification tasks. However, the amount of memory and
computational cost needed for CNNs inference obstructs them to run efficiently
in mobile devices because of memory and computational ability limitation. One
of the method to compress CNNs is compressing the layers iteratively, i.e. by
layer-by-layer compression and fine-tuning, with CP-decomposition in
convolutional layers. To compress with CP-decomposition, rank selection is
important. In the previous approach rank selection that is based on sensitivity
of each layer, the average rank of the network was still arbitrarily selected.
Additionally, the rank of all layers were decided before whole process of
iterative compression, while the rank of a layer can be changed after
fine-tuning. Therefore, this paper proposes selecting rank of each layer using
Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization (VBMF) which is more systematic than
arbitrary approach. Furthermore, to consider the change of each layer's rank
after fine-tuning of previous iteration, the method is applied just before
compressing the target layer, i.e. after fine-tuning of the previous iteration.
The results show better accuracy while also having more compression rate in
AlexNet's convolutional layers compression.

here we consider it in the context of disclosure risk estimation, an
increasingly relevant issue raised by the increasing demand for data collected
under a pledge of confidentiality. Two different criteria are proposed and
jointly used via a two-stage selection procedure, in a M-open view. The first
stage is devoted to identifying a path of search; then, at the second, a small
number of nonparametric models is evaluated through an application-specific
score based Bayesian information criterion. We test our method on a variety of
contingency tables based on microdata samples from the US Census Bureau and the
Italian National Security Administration, treated here as populations, and
carefully discuss its features. This leads us to a journey around different
forms and sources of bias along which we show that (i) while based on the so
called ""score+search"" paradigm, our method is by construction well protected
from the selection-induced bias, and (ii) models with good performances are
invariably characterized by an extraordinarily simple structure of fixed
effects. The complexity of model selection - a very challenging and difficult
task in a strictly parametric context with large and sparse tables - is
therefore significantly defused by our approach. An attractive collateral
result of our analysis are fruitful new ideas about modeling in small area
estimation problems, where interest is in total counts over cells with a small

often considered durability indicators of cement-based materials. However, $K$
is difficult to measure experimentally. This is due to the large pressure
requirements at low degrees of saturation resulting from the fine pore-size
distribution of cement-based materials. As a result, the commonly-used
analytical models, requiring calibration of $K$ from experimental data, are
often inaccurate at low degrees of saturation. On the other hand, measuring
$\sigma_b$ is rather straight forward. Descriptions of the relationship between
$\sigma_b$ and $K$ may therefore be particularly valuable when $K$ is required.
In this work, we use experimental data from previous works to determine the
feasibility of models employing a van Genuchten-Mualem based framework to
predict $K$ and $\sigma_b$ -- expressions for diffusivity $D$ are also
provided. We then develop analytical expressions relating $K$ and $\sigma_b$
using these models. It is then shown that $K = K(\sigma_b)$ and $\sigma_b =
\sigma_b(K)$ may be determined when either parameter is fully described.
Lastly, we propose a simplified model and discuss the roles of pore-size
distribution, saturation, pore connectivity and tortuosity in characterizing
the relationship between $K$ and $\sigma_b$.

through a suitable choice of a field-dependent value for the renormalisation

a generalisation of the standard procedure valid for the one-field case. In our
method, however, the choice of the renormalisation scale does not eliminate
individual logarithmic terms but rather the entire loop corrections to the
effective potential. It allows us to evaluate the improved effective potential
for arbitrary values of the scalar fields using the tree-level potential with
running coupling constants as long as they remain perturbative. This opens the
possibility of studying various applications which require an analysis of
multi-field effective potentials across different energy scales. In particular,
the issue of stability of the scalar potential can be easily studied beyond

equations ruling the shift vector, together with momentum and moment of
momentum equations. To introduce material linearity energy is assumed to have a
quadratic dependence on the strain tensor, the curvature tensor, the shift

analysis of simple loading histories such as axial, biaxial tension/compression

Out-of-plane motions are treated as well; we assume in-plane
tension/compression that leads to buckling/wrinkling and solve for the
components of the shift vector as well as the function present in buckling's
modeling. The assumptions of linearity adopted here simplifies the analysis and
facilitates analytical results.

  approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evaluation of sustainable development - and, in particular, rural
development - through composite indices requires taking into account a
plurality of indicators, which are related to economic, social and
environmental aspects. The points of view evaluated by these indices are
naturally interacting: thus, a bonus has to be recognized to units performing
well on synergic criteria, whereas a penalization has to be assigned on
redundant criteria. An additional difficulty of the modelization is the
elicitation of the parameters for the composite indices, since they are
typically affected by some imprecision. In most approaches, all these critical
points are usually neglected, which in turn yields an unpleasant degree of
approximation in the computation of indices. In this paper we propose a
methodology that allows one to simultaneously handle these delicate issues.
Specifically, to take into account synergy and redundancy between criteria, we
suitably aggregate indicators by means of the Choquet integral. Further, to
obtain recommendations that take into account the space of fluctuation related
to imprecision in nonadditive weights (capacity of the Choquet integral), we
adopt the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and the Stochastic Multicriteria
Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Finally, to study sustainability not only at a
comprehensive level (taking into account all criteria) but also at a local
level (separately taking into account economic, social and environmental
aspects), we apply the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP). We
illustrate the advantages of our approach in a concrete example, in which we
measure the rural sustainability of 51 municipalities in the province of
Catania, the largest city of the East Coast of Sicily (Italy).

constrain the FCNC coupling from $b\rightarrow s$ transitions, especially
$B_s\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ and $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$ processes. In
order to analyze these processes, we derive an effective Lagrangian which is
valid below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. For this purpose, we first
integrate out the VLQ field and derive an effective theory by matching Wilson
coefficients up to one-loop level. Using the effective theory, we construct the
effective Lagrangian for $b\rightarrow s\gamma^{(*)}$. It includes the effects
of the SM quarks and the violation of the CKM unitarity. We show the
constraints on the magnitude of the FCNC coupling and its phase by taking
account of the current experimental data on $\Delta M_{B_s}$,
$\mathrm{Br}[B_s\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-]$, $\mathrm{Br}[\bar{B}\rightarrow

find that the constraint from the $\mathrm{Br}[B_s\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-]$ is
more stringent than that from the $\mathrm{Br}[\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$].

representation of a given data set originates from the basic observation that
real-world objects are composed of different structures at different scales.
Hence, it's reasonable to consider learning features with image pyramids
generated by smoothing and down-sampling operations. In this paper we propose
Laplacian pyramid auto-encoders, a straightforward modification of the deep
convolutional auto-encoder architecture, for unsupervised representation
learning. The method uses multiple encoding-decoding sub-networks within a
Laplacian pyramid framework to reconstruct the original image and the low pass
filtered images. The last layer of each encoding sub-network also connects to
an encoding layer of the sub-network in the next level, which aims to reverse
the process of Laplacian pyramid generation. Experimental results showed that
Laplacian pyramid benefited the classification and reconstruction performance
of deep auto-encoder approaches, and batch normalization is critical to get
deep auto-encoders approaches to begin learning.

intractable for classical computers. Constructing a large-scale quantum
processor, however, is challenging due to errors and noise inherent in
real-world quantum systems. One approach to this challenge is to utilize
modularity--a pervasive strategy found throughout nature and engineering--to
build complex systems robustly. Such an approach manages complexity and
uncertainty by assembling small, specialized components into a larger
architecture. These considerations motivate the development of a quantum
modular architecture, where separate quantum systems are combined via
communication channels into a quantum network. In this architecture, an
essential tool for universal quantum computation is the teleportation of an
entangling quantum gate, a technique originally proposed in 1999 which, until
now, has not been realized deterministically. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate a teleported controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation made deterministic by
utilizing real-time adaptive control. Additionally, we take a crucial step
towards implementing robust, error-correctable modules by enacting the gate
between logical qubits, encoding quantum information redundantly in the states
of superconducting cavities. Such teleported operations have significant
implications for fault-tolerant quantum computation, and when realized within a
network can have broad applications in quantum communication, metrology, and
simulations. Our results illustrate a compelling approach for implementing
multi-qubit operations on logical qubits within an error-protected quantum

of MRI data is a critical step of 3D histology reconstruction. This task is
difficult due to the large differences in image contrast and resolution, as
well as the complex nonrigid distortions produced when sectioning the sample
and mounting it on the glass slide. It has been shown in brain MRI registration
that better spatial alignment across modalities can be obtained by synthesizing
one modality from the other and then using intra-modality registration metrics,
rather than by using mutual information (MI) as metric. However, such an
approach typically requires a database of aligned images from the two
modalities, which is very difficult to obtain for histology/MRI.
  Here, we overcome this limitation with a probabilistic method that
simultaneously solves for registration and synthesis directly on the target
images, without any training data. In our model, the MRI slice is assumed to be
a contrast-warped, spatially deformed version of the histological section. We
use approximate Bayesian inference to iteratively refine the probabilistic
estimate of the synthesis and the registration, while accounting for each
other's uncertainty. Moreover, manually placed landmarks can be seamlessly
integrated in the framework for increased performance.
  Experiments on a synthetic dataset show that, compared with MI, the proposed
method makes it possible to use a much more flexible deformation model in the
registration to improve its accuracy, without compromising robustness.
Moreover, our framework also exploits information in manually placed landmarks
more efficiently than MI, since landmarks inform both synthesis and
registration - as opposed to registration alone. Finally, we show qualitative
results on the public Allen atlas, in which the proposed method provides a
clear improvement over MI based registration.

result. To eliminate frequently encountered confusion, a summary of expressions
for Nye's tensor in terms of elastic and plastic deformation gradient, and for
both small and large deformations, is presented. A further question when
estimating GND density concerns the optimization technique used to solve the
under-determined set of equations linking Nye's tensor and GND density. A
systematic comparison of the densities obtained by two widely used techniques,
L1 and L2 minimisation, shows that both methods yield remarkably similar total
GND densities. Thus the mathematically simpler, L2, may be preferred over L1
except when information about the distribution of densities on specific slip
systems is required. To illustrate this, we compare experimentally measured
lattice distortions beneath nano-indents in pure tungsten, probed using
3D-resolved synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction, with those predicted by 3D
strain-gradient crystal plasticity finite element calculations. The results are
in good agreement and show that the volumetric component of the elastic strain
field has a surprisingly small effect on the determined Nye tensor. This is
important for experimental techniques, such as micro-beam Laue measurements and
HR-EBSD, where only the deviatoric strain component is measured.

offset between the peak of the CRRLs and other tracers, which is very
characteristic for photodissociation regions and that we take as evidence for
CRRLs being preferentially detected from the surfaces of molecular clouds.
Using the CRRLs we constrain the gas electron temperature and density. These
constraints on the gas conditions suggest variations of less than a factor of
two in pressure over $\sim1$ pc scales, and an average hydrogen density of
$200$-$470$ cm$^{-3}$. From the electron temperature and density maps we also
constrain the ionized carbon emission measure, column density and path length.
Based on these, the hydrogen column density is larger than $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$,
with a peak of $\sim4\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ towards the South of Cassiopeia
A. Towards the southern peak the line of sight length is $\sim40$ pc over a

$\mathcal{CP}$-odd neutral Higgs states, leading to three new loop-corrected
mass eigenstates $h_a$, $a \in \lbrace 1,2,3\rbrace$. For scenarios where a
light Higgs boson at about 125 GeV can be identified with the observed signal
and where the other Higgs states are significantly heavier, a large admixture
of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons occurs as a generic feature if
$\mathcal{CP}$-violating effects are taken into account. Including interference
contributions in the predictions for cross sections times branching ratios of
the Higgs bosons is essential in this case. As a first step, we present the
gluon-fusion and bottom-quark annihilation cross sections for $h_a$ for the
general case of arbitrary complex parameters, and we demonstrate that squark
effects strongly depend on the phases of the complex parameters. We then study
the effects of interference between $h_2$ and $h_3$ for the example of the
process $b\bar{b} \to \tau^+\tau^-$. We show that large destructive
interference effects modify LHC exclusion bounds such that parts of the
parameter space that would be excluded by MSSM Higgs searches under the
assumption of $\mathcal{CP}$-conservation open up when the possibility of
$\mathcal{CP}$-violation in the Higgs sector is accounted for.

This has taken on new interests due to the need for interpreting or verifying
neural networks. One basic form for representing stateful rules is
deterministic finite automata (DFA). Previous research shows that extracting
DFAs from trained second-order recurrent networks is not only possible but also
relatively stable. Recently, several new types of recurrent networks with more
complicated architectures have been introduced. These handle challenging
learning tasks usually involving sequential data. However, it remains an open
problem whether DFAs can be adequately extracted from these models.
Specifically, it is not clear how DFA extraction will be affected when applied
to different recurrent networks trained on data sets with different levels of
complexity. Here, we investigate DFA extraction on several widely adopted
recurrent networks that are trained to learn a set of seven regular Tomita
grammars. We first formally analyze the complexity of Tomita grammars and
categorize these grammars according to that complexity. Then we empirically
evaluate different recurrent networks for their performance of DFA extraction
on all Tomita grammars. Our experiments show that for most recurrent networks,
their extraction performance decreases as the complexity of the underlying
grammar increases. On grammars of lower complexity, most recurrent networks
obtain desirable extraction performance. As for grammars with the highest level
of complexity, while several complicated models fail with only certain
recurrent networks having satisfactory extraction performance.

applications, because of the flexibility and effectiveness in modeling
uncertainties without prior information. Besides, it has been proven that the
quantum theory has powerful capabilities of solving the decision making
problems, especially for modelling human decision and cognition. However, the
classical Dempster-Shafer evidence theory modelled by real numbers cannot be
integrated directly with the quantum theory modelled by complex numbers. So,
how can we establish a bridge of communications between the classical
Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and the quantum theory? To answer this
question, a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed in this
paper. The main contribution in this study is that, unlike the existing
evidence theory, a mass function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory is modelled by a complex number, called as a complex mass function. In
addition, compared with the classical Dempster's combination rule, the
condition in terms of the conflict coefficient between two evidences K < 1 is
released in the generalized Dempster's combination rule so that it is more
general and applicable than the classical Dempster's combination rule. When the
complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the
generalized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence
theory under the condition that the conflict coefficient between the evidences
K is less than 1. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency of
the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Finally, an application of an
evidential quantum dynamical model is implemented by integrating the
generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory with the quantum dynamical model.
From the experimental results, it validates the feasibility and effectiveness
of the proposed method.

advantages of the IB and DUGKS, i.e., the flexibility and efficiency for
treating complex flows, and the robustness and low numerical-dissipation. In
IB-DUGKS, the IB method is used to treat the fluid-solid interfaces and the
DUGKS is applied to simulate the fluid flow, making use of the Lagrangian and
Eulerian meshes, respectively. Those two meshes are fully independent, which
contributes to the avoidance of grid regeneration when a solid particle moves.
Specifically, in the present implementation of IB-DUGKS, the no-slip boundary
condition at the particle surface is accurately enforced by introducing an
efficient iterative forcing algorithm, and the IB force induced by the particle
boundary is conveniently incorporated into the DUGKS with the Strange-Splitting
scheme. The accuracy of the IB-DUGKS is first verified in the flows past a
stationary cylinder and an oscillating cylinder in a quiescent fluid. After
that, several well-established two- and three-dimensional particulate flow

inhomogeneous medium, utilize cloud densities and velocity dispersions in the
range derived from optical observations, show that free-free absorption can
account for the $\sim \rm GHz$ peak frequencies and low frequency power laws
inferred from the radio observations. These new computational models replace
the power-law model for the free-free optical depth in the \citep{bicknell97a}
model by a more fundamental model involving disrupted log-normal distributions
of warm gas. One feature of our new models is that at early stages, the low
frequency spectrum is steep but progressively flattens as a result of a broader
distribution of optical depths, suggesting that the steep low frequency spectra
discovered by \citet{callingham17a} may possibly be attributed to young
sources. We also investigate the inverse correlation between peak frequency and
size and find that the initial location on this correlation is determined by
the average density of the warm ISM. The simulated sources track this
correlation initially but eventually fall below it, indicating the need for a
more extended ISM than presently modelled. GPS and CSS sources can potentially
provide new insights into the phenomenon of AGN feedback since their peak
frequencies and spectra are indicative of the density, turbulent structure and
distribution of gas in the host galaxy.

In this paper, a new mathematical model is proposed for the population dynamics

According to the Target Theory, the tumor population is divided into m
different subpopulations based on the diverse effects of ionizing radiation on
human cells. A hybrid model con- sists of a system of differential equations
with random variable coefficients representing the transition rates between
subpopulations is proposed. This model is utilized to sim- ulate the dynamics
of cell subpopulations within a tumor. The model also describes the cell damage
heterogeneity and the repair mechanism between two consecutive dose fractions.
As such, a new definition of tumor lifespan based on population size is intro-
duced. Finally, the stability of the system is studied by using the Gershgorin
theorem. It is proven that the probability of target inactivity post radiation
plays the most important role in the stability of the system.

the RNS on the layer below. As a result, the actual arithmetic is deferred to
the bottom layer. The multiplication algorithm that we use is based on an

multiplication, and multiply-and-accumulate for very large (2000+ bits) moduli,
using only modular operations for small (for example 8-bits) moduli. A hardware
implementation of this method allows for massive parallelization.
  Our method can be applied in cryptographic algorithms such as RSA to realize

to the use of full RNS Montgomery algorithms, the system does not involve any

continuum diffusion processes through layered heterogeneous media. This
mathematical problem is motivated by several practical applications such as
heat transport in composite materials, flow in layered aquifers and drug
diffusion through the layers of the skin. In such processes, the physical
properties of the medium vary across layers and internal boundary conditions
apply at the interfaces between adjacent layers. To characterise the timescale,
we use the concept of mean action time, which provides the mean timescale at
each position in the medium by utilising the fact that the transition of the
transient solution of the underlying partial differential equation model, from
initial state to steady state, can be represented as a cumulative distribution
function of time. Using this concept, we define the characteristic timescale
for a multilayer diffusion process as the maximum value of the mean action time
across the layered medium. For given initial conditions and internal and
external boundary conditions, this approach leads to simple algebraic
expressions for characterising the timescale that depend on the physical and
geometrical properties of the medium, such as the diffusivities and lengths of
the layers. Numerical examples demonstrate that these expressions provide
useful insight into explaining how the parameters in the model affect the time
it takes for a multilayer diffusion process to reach steady state.

existence and uniqueness in terms of the shift vector for some characteristic
