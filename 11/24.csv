constraining the scope of knowledge represented by an ontology. Despite that
CQs are a part of several ontology engineering methodologies, we have observed
that the actual publication of CQs for the available ontologies is very limited
and even scarcer is the publication of their respective formalisations in terms
of, e.g., SPARQL queries. This paper aims to contribute to addressing the
engineering shortcomings of using CQs in ontology development, to facilitate
wider use of CQs. In order to understand the relation between CQs and the
queries over the ontology to test the CQs on an ontology, we gather, analyse,
and publicly release a set of 234 CQs and their translations to SPARQL-OWL for
several ontologies in different domains developed by different groups. We
analysed the CQs in two principal ways. The first stage focused on a linguistic
analysis of the natural language text itself, i.e., a lexico-syntactic analysis
without any presuppositions of ontology elements, and a subsequent step of
semantic analysis in order to find patterns. This increased diversity of CQ
sources resulted in a 5-fold increase of hitherto published patterns, to 106
distinct CQ patterns, which have a limited subset of few patterns shared across
the CQ sets from the different ontologies. Next, we analysed the relation
between the found CQ patterns and the 46 SPARQL-OWL query signatures, which
revealed that one CQ pattern may be realised by more than one SPARQL-OWL query
signature, and vice versa. We hope that our work will contribute to
establishing common practices, templates, automation, and user tools that will
support CQ formulation, formalisation, execution, and general management.

Brownian yet non-Gaussian dynamics was observed. These are processes
characterised by a linear growth in time of the mean squared displacement, yet
the probability density function of the particle displacement is distinctly
non-Gaussian, and often of exponential (Laplace) shape. This apparently
ubiquitous behaviour observed in very different physical systems has been
interpreted as resulting from diffusion in inhomogeneous environments and
mathematically represented through a variable, stochastic diffusion
coefficient. Indeed different models describing a fluctuating diffusivity have
been studied. Here we present a new view of the stochastic basis describing
time dependent random diffusivities within a broad spectrum of distributions.
Concretely, our study is based on the very generic class of the generalised
Gamma distribution. Two models for the particle spreading in such random
diffusivity settings are studied. The first belongs to the class of generalised
grey Brownian motion while the second follows from the idea of diffusing
diffusivities. The two processes exhibit significant characteristics which
reproduce experimental results from different biological and physical systems.
We promote these two physical models for the description of stochastic particle
motion in complex environments.

theoretical and computational viewpoints. In these problems, one selects a

$V(G)$ (i.e. either $V(G)\setminus C$ or $V(G)$ itself) are uniquely determined
by their neighborhoods in $C$. A typical line of attack for these problems is
to determine tight bounds for the minimum codes in various graphs classes. In
this work, we present tight lower and upper bounds for all three types of codes
for \emph{block graphs} (i.e. diamond-free chordal graphs). Our bounds are in
terms of the number of maximal cliques (or \emph{blocks}) of a block graph and
the order of the graph. Two of our upper bounds verify conjectures from the

the number of blocks and the order of the block graph. We provide examples of
families of block graphs whose minimum codes attain these bounds, thus showing
each bound to be tight.

interactions are a key ingredient for the manifestation of genuine quantum
effects. A particularly attractive switching mechanism of dynamical systems are
infinite-period bifurcations into limit cycles, as these set on with a finite
amplitude. Here we describe how to realize this switching mechanism by
combining attractive and repulsive particle interactions in a
driven-dissipative Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, such as realized in excitonic
lasers and condensates so that the system displays a nonhermitian combination
of parity and charge-conjugation (PC) symmetry. We show that this symmetry
survives in the nonlinear case and induces infinite-period and limit-cycle
bifurcations (distinct from a Hopf bifurcation) where the system switches from
a symmetry-breaking stationary state into a symmetry-protected
power-oscillating state of finite amplitude. These protected dynamical
solutions display a number of characteristic features, among which are their
finite amplitude at onset, their arbitrary long oscillation period close to
threshold, and the symmetry of their frequency spectrum which provides a
tuneable frequency comb. Phases with different transition scenarios are
separated by exceptional points in the stability spectrum, involving
nonhermitian degeneracies of symmetry-protected excitations.

for several processes such as cell motility or cell division. Each of these
networks are composed of organized actin microfilaments which are decorated
with specific sets of actin binding proteins (ABPs). The molecular mechanisms
guiding ABPs to specific actin networks are still poorly understood, but
cooperativity, the mechanism by which the binding of an ABP is positively
influenced by proximal bound ABPs, plays a crucial role in generating locally
dense stretches of ABPs. Cooperative binding is characterized by its amplitude,
but also by the range at which its effects are propagated along an actin
filament through long-range allosteric interactions. The range of these
allosteric effects is still debated, but is likely to be significant at the
lengthscale of actin filaments in cells. Here, we investigated how
cooperativity influences the clustering of ABPs, using a stochastic
computational model of binding of ABPs to actin filaments. The model reproduces
the formation of ABP clusters observed experimentally at the single filament
scale, and provides a theoretical estimation of the range of cooperativity for
proteins such as ADF/cofilin. We found that both the amplitude and the spatial
range of cooperativity dramatically impact the properties of clustering.
However, the parameters of cooperativity modulate differently the rate of
assembly, size and dynamics of the ABP clusters, suggesting that cooperativity
is an efficient mechanism to regulate precisely the recruitment of ABPs in
cells. This work provides a more general framework for future understanding of
how actin networks acquire distinct and specific protein compositions from a
common cytoplasm.

coronal jets are up to a hundred times bigger than large penumbral jets, and in
EUV/X-ray images show clear twisting motion in their spires. Here, using IRIS
\MgII\ k 2796 \AA\ SJ images and spectra in the penumbrae of two sunspots we
characterize large penumbral jets. We find redshift and blueshift next to each
other across several large penumbral jets, and interpret these as untwisting of
the magnetic field in the jet spire. Using Hinode/SOT (FG and SP) data, we also
find mixed-polarity magnetic flux at the base of these jets. Because large
penumbral jets have mixed-polarity field at their base and have twisting motion
in their spires, they might be driven the same way as QR, CH and AR coronal
jets.

stored pattern in the presence of interference due to other stored patterns and

attractor dynamics, which iteratively clean up patterns during recall. However,
incorporating attractor dynamics into modern deep learning systems poses
difficulties: attractor basins are characterised by vanishing gradients, which
are known to make training neural networks difficult. In this work, we avoid
the vanishing gradient problem by training a generative distributed memory
without simulating the attractor dynamics. Based on the idea of memory writing
as inference, as proposed in the Kanerva Machine, we show that a
likelihood-based Lyapunov function emerges from maximising the variational
lower-bound of a generative memory. Experiments shows it converges to correct

the dust-based formation mechanism of the Broad Line Region (BLR). Recent

In this work, a flexoelectric-like effect is introduced to enhance the
effective flexoelectricity of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bar. The
flexoelectric-like effect is realized by depositing a layer of net charges on
the middle plane of the bar to form an electret. Experiments show that the
enhancement of the flexoelectricity depends on the density of inserted net
charges. It is found that a charged layer with surface potential of -5723V
results in 100 times increase of the material's flexoelectric coefficient. We
also show that the enhancement is proportional to the thickness of electrets.

the exact reason of its effectiveness remains poorly understood. The direct

that $\|\nabla f\| \leq K$. In this work, we uncover an even more important
effect of Lipschitz regularization by examining its impact on the loss
function: It degenerates GAN loss functions to almost linear ones by
restricting their domain and interval of attainable gradient values. Our
analysis shows that loss functions are only successful if they are degenerated
to almost linear ones. We also show that loss functions perform poorly if they
are not degenerated and that a wide range of functions can be used as loss
function as long as they are sufficiently degenerated by regularization.
Basically, Lipschitz regularization ensures that all loss functions effectively
work in the same way. Empirically, we verify our proposition on the MNIST,

attention mechanism have achieved great progress. However, there are still
challenges, especially for Neural Machine Translation (NMT), such as lower
translation quality on long sentences. In this paper, we present a hierarchical
deep neural network architecture to improve the quality of long sentences
translation. The proposed network embeds sequence-to-sequence neural networks
into a two-level category hierarchy by following the coarse-to-fine paradigm.
Long sentences are input by splitting them into shorter sequences, which can be
well processed by the coarse category network as the long distance dependencies
for short sentences is able to be handled by network based on
sequence-to-sequence neural network. Then they are concatenated and corrected
by the fine category network. The experiments shows that our method can achieve
superior results with higher BLEU(Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores,
lower perplexity and better performance in imitating expression style and words
usage than the traditional networks.

constructs the coupled-channel equations of atomic and molecular scattering
theory, and solves them by propagating the wavefunction or log-derivative
matrix outwards from short range to the asymptotic region. It then applies
scattering boundary conditions to extract the scattering matrix (S matrix).
Built-in coupling cases include atom + rigid linear molecule, atom + vibrating
diatom, atom + rigid symmetric top, atom + asymmetric or spherical top, rigid
diatom + rigid diatom, rigid diatom + asymmetric top, and diffractive
scattering of an atom from a crystal surface. Interaction potentials may be
specified either in program input (for simple cases) or with user-supplied
routines. For the built-in coupling cases, MOLSCAT can loop over partial wave
(or total angular momentum) to calculate elastic and inelastic cross integral
sections and spectroscopic line-shape cross sections. Post-processors are
available to calculate differential cross sections, transport, relaxation and
Senftleben-Beenakker cross sections, and to fit the parameters of scattering
resonances. MOLSCAT also provides an interface for plug-in routines to specify
coupling cases (Hamiltonians and basis sets) that are not built in; plug-in
routines are supplied to handle collisions of a pair of alkali-metal atoms with
hyperfine structure in an applied magnetic field. For low-energy scattering,
MOLSCAT can calculate scattering lengths and effective ranges and can locate
and characterize scattering resonances as a function of an external variable
such as the magnetic field.

applied to the phenyl radical and compared with two more approximate approaches
based on the global harmonic approximation - the global harmonic method expands
both the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces to the second
order about the corresponding minima, while the combined global
harmonic/on-the-fly method retains the on-the-fly scheme for the excited-state
wavepacket propagation. We also compare the spectra by considering their means
and widths, and show analytically how these measures are related to the
properties of the semiclassical wavepacket. We find that the combined approach
is better than the global harmonic one in describing the vibrational structure,
while the global harmonic approximation estimates better the overall means and
widths of the spectra due to a partial cancellation of errors. Although the
full-dimensional on-the-fly ab initio result seems to reflect the dynamics of
only one mode, we show, by performing exact quantum calculations, that this
simple structure cannot be recovered using a one-dimensional model. Yet, the
agreement between the quantum and semiclassical spectra in this simple, but
anharmonic model lends additional support for the full-dimensional ab initio
thawed Gaussian calculation of the phenyl radical spectra. We conclude that the
thawed Gaussian approximation provides a viable alternative to the expensive or
unfeasible exact quantum calculations in cases, where low-dimensional models
are not sufficiently accurate to represent the full system.

painting--would appear indicative of discontinuities in cultural lineages.
However, if what evolves through culture is our worldviews--the webs of
thoughts, ideas, and attitudes that constitutes our way of seeing being in the
world--then the problem of discontinuities is solved. The state of a worldview
can be affected by information assimilated in one domain, and this
change-of-state can be expressed in another domain. In this view, the gesture,
narrative, or artifact that constitutes a specific creative act is not what is
evolving; it is merely the external manifestation of the state of an evolving
worldview. Like any evolutionary process, cultural evolution requires a balance
between novelty, via the generation of variation, and continuity, via the
preservation of variants that are adaptive. In cultural evolution, novelty is
generated through creativity, and continuity is provided by social learning
processes, e.g., imitation. Both the generative and imitative aspects of
cultural evolution are affected by social media. We discuss the trajectory from
social ideation to social innovation, focusing on the role of
self-organization, renewal, and perspective-taking at the individual and social

satisfactory precision. In the formal fast switching limit, finally, we argue
that the onset of collective synchronization is captured by the time-averaged

Considering $L_2$ norm distortions, the Carlini and Wagner attack is presently
the most effective white-box attack in the literature. However, this method is
slow since it performs a line-search for one of the optimization terms, and
often requires thousands of iterations. In this paper, an efficient approach is
proposed to generate gradient-based attacks that induce misclassifications with
low $L_2$ norm, by decoupling the direction and the norm of the adversarial
perturbation that is added to the image. Experiments conducted on the MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our attack achieves comparable
results to the state-of-the-art (in terms of $L_2$ norm) with considerably
fewer iterations (as few as 100 iterations), which opens the possibility of
using these attacks for adversarial training. Models trained with our attack
achieve state-of-the-art robustness against white-box gradient-based $L_2$

is currently still limited, the ${\rm BR}(B_c\to\tau\nu)$ constraint has a
significant impact: depending on whether one uses a limit of $60\%$, $30\%$ or
$10\%$, the pull for new physics (NP) in scalar operators changes drastically.
More specifically, for a conservative $60\%$ limit a scenario with scalar
operators gives the best fit to data, while for an aggressive $10\%$ limit this
scenario is strongly disfavored and the best fit is obtained in a scenario in
which only a left-handed vector operator is generated. We find a sum rule for
the branching ratios of $B\to D\tau\nu$, $B\to D^*\tau\nu$ and $\Lambda_b\to

nutation/precession motions. We derive a high-resolution (~ 10 pc) rotation
curve of the SMC out to R ~ 4 kpc. After correcting for asymmetric drift, the
circular velocity slowly rises to a maximum value of Vc ~ 55 km/s at R ~ 2.8
kpc and possibly flattens outwards. In spite of the SMC undergoing strong
gravitational interactions with its neighbours, its HI rotation curve is akin
to that of many isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We decompose the rotation
curve and explore different dynamical models to deal with the unknown
three-dimensional shape of the mass components (gas, stars and dark matter). We
find that, for reasonable mass-to-light ratios, a dominant dark matter halo

planet-disk interaction, have suggested that a single planet may excite
multiple spiral arms in the disk, in contrast to the previous expectations
based on linear theory (predicting a one-armed density wave). We re-assess the
origin of multiple arms in the framework of linear theory, by solving for the
global two-dimensional response of a non-barotropic disk to an orbiting planet.
We show that the formation of a secondary arm in the inner disk, at about half
of the orbital radius of the planet, is a robust prediction of linear theory.
This arm becomes stronger than the primary spiral at several tenths of the
orbital radius of the planet. Several additional, weaker spiral arms may also
form in the inner disk. On the contrary, a secondary spiral arm is unlikely to
form in the outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully accounting for the
global behavior of both the phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally
support the recently proposed WKB phase argument for the secondary arm origin
(as caused by the intricacy of constructive interference of azimuthal harmonics
of the perturbation at different radii). We provide analytical arguments
showing that the process of a single spiral wake splitting up into multiple
arms is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in differentially rotating
disks. It is not unique to planet-driven waves and occurs also in linear
calculations of spiral wakes freely propagating with no external torques. These
results are relevant for understanding formation of multiple rings and gaps in
protoplanetary disks.

of the bispectrum. Previous studies have shown that the position-dependent
power spectrum is a simple and efficient way to probe the squeezed-limit
bispectrum. In this approach, the survey is divided into subvolumes and the
correlation between the local power spectrum and the corresponding mean density
of the subvolume is computed. This correlation is equivalent to an integral of
the bispectrum in the squeezed limit, but is much simpler to implement than the
usual bispectrum estimators. It also has a clear physical interpretation: it
describes how the small-scale power spectrum of tracers such as galaxies and
the 21-cm signal respond to a large-scale environment. Reionization naturally
couples large and small scales as ionizing radiation produced by galactic
sources can travel up to tens of Megaparsecs through the intergalactic medium
during this process. Here we apply the position-dependent power spectrum
approach to fluctuations in the 21-cm background from reionization. We show
that this statistic has a distinctive evolution in time that can be understood

distinguish between simple ""inside-out"" and ""outside-in"" models of

via non-thermal freeze-in. In both cases, we take into account all production

different but well-motivated theories of gravity (metric and Palatini), discuss
multifield effects in case both fields ($s$ and $h$) were dynamical during
inflation, and take into account the non-perturbative nature of particle

in collective energy dynamics. It establishes a precise connection between
resummed, all-order hydrodynamics and the underlying microscopic chaos. In this
paper, we demonstrate the existence of pole-skipping in holographic conformal
field theories with higher-derivative gravity duals. In particular, we first
consider Einstein-Hilbert gravity deformed by curvature-squared ($R^2$)
corrections and then type IIB supergravity theory with the $\alpha'^3 R^4$
term, where $\alpha'$ is set by the length of the fundamental string. The
former case allows us to discuss the effects of leading-order $1/N_c$
corrections (with $N_c$ being the number of colours of the dual gauge group)
and phenomenological coupling constant dependence. In Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
theory, pole-skipping turns out to be valid non-perturbatively in the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling. The $\alpha'^3 R^4$ deformation enables us to study
perturbative inverse 't Hooft coupling corrections ($\alpha'^3 \sim 1 /
\lambda^{3/2}$) in $SU(N_c)$, $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory with infinite $N_c$. While the maximal Lyapunov exponent characterising
quantum chaos remains uncorrected, the butterfly velocity is shown to depend
both on $N_c$ and the coupling. Several implications of the relation between
hydrodynamics and chaos are discussed, including an intriguing similarity
between the dependence of the butterfly velocity and the ratio of shear
viscosity to entropy density on stringy corrections.

rates. Furthermore, we calculate the diffusion coefficient of quarkonium. We

core-selecting, and hence coalition-proof. In contrast to the LMP mechanism,
core-selecting mechanisms exist for a broad class of electricity markets, such
as ones involving nonconvex costs and nonconvex constraint sets. In addition,
they can approximate truthfulness without the price-taking assumption of the

bound states in string theory should be accounted for by adding the entropy of
source-free horizonless supergravity solutions to the entropy associated with
the horizons of small black holes. This would imply that the entropy arises
differently depending on the duality frame: in the D1-D5 frame one would count
source-free horizonless solutions, while in the NS1-P frame one would compute
the area of a horizon. This might lead to the belief that the microstates are
described by fuzzball solutions in the D1-D5 duality frame but by a black hole
with a horizon in the latter. We argue that this is not the case, and that the
microstates are fuzzballs in all duality frames. We observe that the scaling
argument used by Sen fails to account for the entropy in the D1-P and other
duality frames. We also note that the traditional extremal black hole solution
is not a complete string background, since finite-action paths connect the
exterior near-horizon extremal throat to the region inside the horizon,
including the singularity. The singularity of the traditional black hole
solution does not give a valid boundary condition for a fundamental string;
correcting this condition by resolving the singularity modifies the black hole
to a fuzzball with no horizon. We argue that for questions of counting states,
the traditional black hole solution should be understood through its Euclidean
continuation as a saddle point, and that the Lorentzian states being counted
are fuzzballs in all duality frames.

other brightest cluster galaxies, stimulated cooling, where X-ray cavities lift
low entropy cluster gas until it becomes thermally unstable, cannot have
produced the observed gas reservoir. Instead, the molecular gas has likely
formed as a result of sloshing motions in the intracluster medium induced by a
nearby galaxy. Sloshing can emulate uplift by dislodging gas from the galactic
center. This gas has the shortest cooling time, so will condense if disrupted
for long enough.

common in the brains of the elderly population and may be caused by ischemia or
demyelination. Lesions are biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases,
making accurate quantification of them important for both disease diagnosis and
progression. Automatic lesion detection using supervised learning requires
manually annotated images, which can often be impractical to acquire.
Unsupervised lesion detection, on the other hand, does not require any manual
delineation; however, these methods can be challenging to construct due to the
variability in lesion load, placement of lesions, and voxel intensities. Here
we present a novel approach to address this problem using a convolutional
autoencoder, which learns to segment brain lesions as well as the white matter,
gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid by reconstructing FLAIR images as conical
combinations of softmax layer outputs generated from the corresponding T1, T2,
and FLAIR images. Some of the advantages of this model are that it accurately
learns to segment lesions regardless of lesion load, and it can be used to
quickly and robustly segment new images that were not in the training set.
Comparisons with state-of-the-art segmentation methods evaluated on ground
truth manual labels indicate that the proposed method works well for generating
accurate lesion segmentations without the need for manual annotations.

important role in revealing issues in interactions among cooperating

in identifying timing issues at integration level by automatic code
instrumentation at invocation points. The code analysis engine of
IntegrationDistiller is built and automated using .NET compiler platform, known

(sub)stellar multiplicity status of exoplanet host stars, that were not
previously investigated for stellar multiplicity in the literature. For systems
with non-detections we provide detailed detection limits to make them
accessible for further statistical analysis. Methods: For this purpose we have
employed previously unpublished high-resolution imaging data taken with
VLT/NACO in a wide variety of different scientific programs and publicly
accessible in the ESO archive. We used astrometric and theoretical population
synthesis to determine whether detected companion candidates are likely to be
bound or are merely chance-projected background objects. Results: We provide
detailed detection limits for 39 systems and investigate 29 previously unknown
companion candidates around five systems. In addition, we show for the first

can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to
vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves
staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked
tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated
list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing
token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We
propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby
only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined
multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a
simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two
key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given
item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way
that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to
evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct
simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing
token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In
particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our
simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the
greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed
token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a
simplified mathematical analysis.

deep network model of the primate ATTention Network (ATTNet) that learns to
shift its attention so as to maximize the reward. Using deep reinforcement
learning, ATTNet learned to shift its attention to the visual features of a
target category in the context of a search task. ATTNet's dorsal layers also
learned to prioritize these shifts of attention so as to maximize success of
the ventral pathway classification and receive greater reward. Model behavior
was tested against the fixations made by subjects searching images for the same
cued category. Both subjects and ATTNet showed evidence for attention being
preferentially directed to target goals, behaviorally measured as oculomotor
guidance to targets. More fundamentally, ATTNet learned to shift its attention
to target like objects and spatially route its visual inputs to accomplish the
task. This work makes a step toward a better understanding of the role of
attention in the brain and other computational systems.

advent of image sharing platforms and the easy availability of advanced photo

widely, concerns on the spread of fake news and misinformation is growing.
Current state of the art methods for detecting these manipulated images suffers
from the lack of training data due to the laborious labeling process. We
address this problem in this paper, for which we introduce a manipulated image
generation process that creates true positives using currently available
datasets. Drawing from traditional work on image blending, we propose a novel
generator for creating such examples. In addition, we also propose to further
create examples that force the algorithm to focus on boundary artifacts during
training. Strong experimental results validate our proposal.

advent of modern communication media has made it an even more challenging
problem, as crowd dynamics could be driven by both human-to-human and
human-technology interactions. Here, we study the dynamics of a crowd
controlled game (Twitch Plays Pok\'emon), in which nearly a million players
participated during more than two weeks. We dissect the temporal evolution of
the system dynamics along the two distinct phases that characterized the game.
We find that players who do not follow the crowd average behavior are key to
succeed in the game. The latter finding can be well explained by an n-$th$
order Markov model that reproduces the observed behavior. Secondly, we analyze
a phase of the game in which players were able to decide between two different
modes of playing, mimicking a voting system. Our results suggest that under
some conditions, the collective dynamics can be better regarded as a swarm-like
behavior instead of a crowd. Finally, we discuss our findings in the light of
the social identity theory, which appears to describe well the observed
dynamics.

content delivery networks, and mobile networks, where per-connection
consistency (PCC) has to be met for optimal performance. Cloud-native L4 load
balancers are commonly deployed as virtual network functions (VNFs) and are a
critical forwarding element in modern cloud infrastructure. We identify load
imbalance among service instances as the main cause of additional processing
delay caused by transport-layer load balancers. Existing transport-layer load
balancers rely on one of two methods: host-level traffic redirection, which may
add as much as 12.48% additional traffic to underlying networks, or connection
tracking, which consumes a considerable amount of memory in load balancers.
Both of these methods result in inefficient usage of network resources. We
propose the in-network congestion-aware load Balancer (INCAB) to achieve even
load distribution among service instances and optimal network resources usage
in addition to meeting the PCC requirement. We show that INCAB is capable of
identifying and monitoring each instance's most-utilized resource and can
improve the load distribution among all service instances. INCAB utilizes a
Bloom filter and an ultra-compact connection table for in-network flow
distribution. Furthermore, it does not rely on end hosts for traffic
redirection. Our flow level simulations show that INCAB improves flows' average
completion time by 31.97% compared to stateless solutions.

11)\times 10^{6}$ $B\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance
with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. We first measure the
absolute branching fraction for $B^- \to \bar{\Lambda}_c^- \Xi_c^0$ using a
missing-mass technique; the result is ${\cal B}(B^- \to \bar{\Lambda}_c^-
\Xi_c^0) = (9.51 \pm 2.10 \pm 0.88) \times 10^{-4}$. We subsequently measure
the product branching fractions ${\cal B}(B^- \to \bar{\Lambda}_c^-

\bar{\Lambda}_c^- \Xi_c^0) {\cal B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Lambda K^- \pi^+)$, and ${\cal

with improved precision. Dividing these product branching fractions by the
result for $B^- \to \bar{\Lambda}_c^- \Xi_c^0$ yields the following branching
fractions: ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \pi^+)= (1.80 \pm 0.50 \pm 0.14)\%$,
${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Lambda K^- \pi^+)=(1.17 \pm 0.37 \pm 0.09)\%$, and
${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0 \to p K^- K^- \pi^+)=(0.58 \pm 0.23 \pm 0.05)\%.$ For the
above branching fractions, the first uncertainties are statistical and the
second are systematic. Our result for ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \pi^+)$ can
be combined with $\Xi_c^0$ branching fractions measured relative to $\Xi_c^0
\to \Xi^- \pi^+$ to yield other absolute $\Xi_c^0$ branching fractions.

inference: networks of neurons compute posterior beliefs over unobserved causes
given the sensory inputs. How these beliefs are computed and represented by
neural responses is much-debated (Fiser et al. 2010, Pouget et al. 2013). A
central debate concerns the question of whether neural responses represent
samples of latent variables (Hoyer & Hyvarinnen 2003) or parameters of their
distributions (Ma et al. 2006) with efforts being made to distinguish between
them (Grabska-Barwinska et al. 2013). A separate debate addresses the question
of whether neural responses are proportionally related to the encoded
probabilities (Barlow 1969), or proportional to the logarithm of those
probabilities (Jazayeri & Movshon 2006, Ma et al. 2006, Beck et al. 2012).
Here, we show that these alternatives - contrary to common assumptions - are
not mutually exclusive and that the very same system can be compatible with all
of them. As a central analytical result, we show that modeling neural responses
in area V1 as samples from a posterior distribution over latents in a linear
Gaussian model of the image implies that those neural responses form a linear
Probabilistic Population Code (PPC, Ma et al. 2006). In particular, the
posterior distribution over some experimenter-defined variable like
""orientation"" is part of the exponential family with sufficient statistics that
are linear in the neural sampling-based firing rates.

the trigger particle and the region $3 < p_{\rm{Tt}} < 15$ GeV/$c$ is explored

a rising trend suggesting increased branching for higher transverse momentum.

$s$-fractional perimeter and its minimizers, the $s$-minimal sets. We
investigate the behavior of sets having (locally) finite fractional perimeter
and we establish existence and compactness results for (locally) $s$-minimal
sets. We study the $s$-minimal sets in highly nonlocal regimes, that correspond
to small values of the fractional parameter $s$. We introduce a functional
framework for studying those $s$-minimal sets that can be globally written as
subgraphs. In particular, we prove existence and uniqueness results for
minimizers of a fractional version of the classical area functional and we show
the equivalence between minimizers and various notions of solution of the
fractional mean curvature equation. We also prove a flatness result for entire
nonlocal minimal graphs having some partial derivatives bounded from either
above or below. Moreover, we consider a free boundary problem, which consists
in the minimization of a functional defined as the sum of a nonlocal energy,
plus the classical perimeter. Concerning this problem, we prove uniform energy
estimates and we study the blow-up sequence of a minimizer---in particular
establishing a Weiss-type monotonicity formula.

that the total mass of accumulated dust particles is sensitive to the
turbulence strength in the dead zone, $\alpha_{\rm dead}$, because of the
combined effect of turbulence-induced particle fragmentation (which suppresses
particle radial drift) and turbulent diffusion. For a typical critical
fragmentation velocity of silicate dust particles of $1~{\rm m~s^{-1}}$, the
stress to pressure ratio $\alpha_{\rm dead}$ needs to be lower than $3 \times
10^{-4}$ for dust trapping to operate. The obtained dust distribution is
postprocessed using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate infrared
scattered-light images of the inner part of protoplanetary disks with a dust
pileup. We find that a dust pileup at the dead-zone inner edge, if present,
casts a shadow extending out to $\sim 10~{\rm au}$. In the shadowed region the
temperature significantly drops, which in some cases yields even multiple water
snow lines. We also find that even without a dust pileup at the dead-zone inner
edge, the disk surface can become thermally unstable, and the excited waves can
naturally produce shadows and ring-like structures in observed images. This
mechanism might account for the ring-like structures seen in the
scattered-light images of some disks, such as the TW Hya disk.

attention in recent years due to the need for compact representations
supporting efficient search/retrieval in large-scale databases such as online
images. Among many possibilities, Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as
the dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring
shortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and
utilization of hash codes: pushing a system to attain higher mAP will
inevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of
the hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples
in the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not
necessarily do a better job in retrieval. In this paper, we introduce a new
metric named Mean Local Group Average Precision (mLGAP) for better evaluation
of the performance of hashing-based retrieval. The new metric provides a
retrieval performance measure that also reconciles the utilization of hash
codes, leading to a more practically meaningful performance metric than
conventional ones like mAP. To this end, we start by mathematical analysis of
the deficiencies of mAP for hashing-based retrieval. We then propose mLGAP and
show why it is more appropriate for hashing-based retrieval. Experiments on
image retrieval are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
metric.

a promising way of performing de-novo molecular design. Although graph
generative models are currently available they either have a graph size
dependency in their number of parameters, limiting their use to only very small
graphs or are formulated as a sequence of discrete actions needed to construct
a graph, making the output graph non-differentiable w.r.t the model parameters,
therefore preventing them to be used in scenarios such as conditional graph

that is computationally efficient and enables direct optimisation of the graph.
We demonstrate favourable performance of our model on prototype-based molecular

combined with 2D materials such as graphene, it offers many opportunities for
spintronics. The origin of 2D magnetism is from magnetic insulating behaviors,
which could result in magnetic excitations and also proximity effects. However,
the phenomena were only observed at extremely low temperatures. Fe and graphene
interfaces could control spin structures in which they show a unique atomic
spin modulation and magnetic coupling through the interface. Another reason for
covering graphene on Fe is to prevent oxidation under ambient conditions. We
investigated the engineering of spin configurations by growing monolayer
graphene on an Fe(111) single crystal surface and observed the presence of
sharply branched, 3D tree-like domain structures. Magnetization by a sweeping
magnetic field (m-H) revealed that the interface showed canted magnetization in
the in-plane (IP) orientation. Moreover, graphene could completely prevent the
oxidation of the Fe surface. The results indicate possible control of the spin
structures at the atomic scale and the interface phenomena in the 2D structure.
The study introduces a new approach for room temperature 2D magnetism.

variety of systems, most of them based on kHz-MHz sound waves, with typical
wavelength of the order of the centimeter. Recently, some of these concepts

diagnosis codes on babies' records provide fine-grained information on
prematurity. Due to data de-identification, the links between mothers and
babies are not available. We developed a heuristic based on admission and
discharge times to match babies to their mothers and hence enrich mothers'
records with additional information on delivery status. The obtained additional
dataset from the matching heuristic has noisy labels and was used to leverage
the training of the deep learning model. We propose an Alternating Loss

First, the label corruption matrix is estimated using the data subset with both

correct for the label noise. The network is alternately trained on epochs with
the clean dataset with a simple cross-entropy loss and on next epoch with the

transition to the long-range ordered ferroelectric phase with the spontaneous

paradigm of evidence based conditional inference. Multi-modal techniques in
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be seen as perturbing the latent feature

they require training a specialized network which can map sparse evidence to a
high dimensional latent space vector. Designing such a network, as well as
collecting jointly labeled data for training is a non-trivial task. In this
paper, we present a novel multi-task learning (MTL) based framework to perform
evidence based conditional inference in DNNs which can overcome both these

task(s), while modeling the original problem as the primary task of interest.
During inference, we employ a novel Bayesian formulation to change the joint

evidence. Since our approach models evidence as prediction from a DNN, this can
often be achieved using standard pre-trained backbones for popular tasks,
eliminating the need for training altogether. Even when training is required,
our MTL architecture ensures the same can be done without any need for jointly
labeled data. Exploiting evidence using our framework, we show an improvement

a favorite topic in laboratory and space plasmas. An oblique electromagnetic
instability dominates the unstable spectrum. In the interaction with the
generated electromagnetic fields, the cloud electrons are entirely mixed with
the ambient ones and form a hot electron population. The velocity of the cloud
ions, however, has not changed significantly from the initial bulk velocity. As
this ion cloud propagates into the plasma, it derives an electrostatic field
which can accelerate the electrons up to energy equipartition between electrons
and ions. The electrostatic field is amplified at the expense of the kinetic
energy of ions, and its spatial scale is in order of the electron skin depth.
The electron acceleration in such an electrostatic field is, therefore, a

of individual galaxies provide high signal-to-noise composite spectra that are
essential for constraining IMF and to investigate possible radial gradients of
the IMF within individual galaxies. The large sample of ETGs also make it
possible to study how the IMF shape depends on various properties of galaxies.
We adopt a novel approach to study IMF variations in ETGs, use Bayesian
inferences based on full spectrum fitting. The Bayesian method provides a
statistically rigorous way to explore potential degeneracy in spectrum fitting,
and to distinguish different IMF models with Bayesian evidence. We find that
the IMF slope depends systematically on galaxy velocity dispersion, in that
galaxies of higher velocity dispersion prefer a more bottom-heavy IMF, but the
dependence is almost entirely due to the change of metallicity, $Z$, with
velocity dispersion. The IMF shape also depends on stellar age, $A$, but the
dependence is completely degenerate with that on metallicity through a
combination $AZ^{-1.42}$. Using independent age and metallicity estimates we
find that the IMF variation is produced by metallicity instead of age. The IMF
near the centers of massive ETGs appears more bottom-heavy than that in the
outer parts, while a weak opposite trend is seen for low-mass ETGs.
Uncertainties produced by star formation history, dust extinction,
$\alpha$-element abundance enhancement and noise in the spectra are tested.

model uncertainty, we follow a Bayesian approach, wherein, Monte Carlo (MC)
samples from the posterior distribution are generated by keeping the dropout
layers active at test time. Entropy over the MC samples provides a voxel-wise
model uncertainty map, whereas expectation over the MC predictions provides the
final segmentation. Next to voxel-wise uncertainty, we introduce four metrics
to quantify structure-wise uncertainty in segmentation for quality control. We
report experiments on four out-of-sample datasets comprising of diverse age
range, pathology and imaging artifacts. The proposed structure-wise uncertainty
metrics are highly correlated with the Dice score estimated with manual
annotation and therefore present an inherent measure of segmentation quality.
In particular, the intersection over union over all the MC samples is a
suitable proxy for the Dice score. In addition to quality control at
scan-level, we propose to incorporate the structure-wise uncertainty as a
measure of confidence to do reliable group analysis on large data repositories.
We envisage that the introduced uncertainty metrics would help assess the
fidelity of automated deep learning based segmentation methods for large-scale
population studies, as they enable automated quality control and group analyses

important representations for the braid group. Partly, because of its
connections to the Alexander polynomial which is one of the first and most
useful invariants for knots and links. In the present work, we show that
interesting representations of braid group could be achieved using a simple and
intuitive approach, where we simply analyse the path of strands in a braid and
encode the over-crossings, under-crossings or no-crossings into some
parameters. More precisely, at each crossing, where, for example, the strand
$i$ crosses over the strand $i+1$ we assign $\mathbf{t}$ to the {\bf t}op
strand and $\mathbf{b}$ to the {\bf b}ottom strand. We consider the parameter
$\mathbf{t}$ as a {\it relative weight} given to strand $i$ relative to $i+1$,
hence the position $i\ i+1$ for $\mathbf{t}$ in the matrix representation.
Similarly, the parameter $\mathbf{b}$ is a {\it relative weight} given to
strand $i+1$ relative to $i$, hence the position $i+1\ i$ for $\mathbf{b}$ in
the matrix representation. We show this simple {\it path analyzing approach}
leads us to an interesting simple representation. Next, we show that following
the same intuitive approach, only by introducing an additional parameter, we
can greatly improve the representation into the one with much smaller kernel.
This more general representation includes the unreduced Burau representation,
as a special case. Our new {\it path analyzing approach} has the advantage that
it applies a very simple and intuitive method capturing the fundamental
interactions of the strands in a braid. In this approach we intuitively follow
each strand in a braid and create a {\it history} for the strand as it
interacts with other strands via over-crossings, under-crossings or
no-crossings. This, directly, leads us to the desired representations.

the geomagnetic field have not previously been allowed for. As a result, the
components of the 'classical' $aa$ index for the southern and northern

both $aa_S$ and $aa_N$ for both these effects using the same method as used to
generate the classic $aa$ values but allowing ${\delta}$, the minimum angular
separation of each station from a nominal auroral oval, to vary as calculated
using the IGRF-12 and gufm1 models of the intrinsic geomagnetic field. Our
approach is to correct the quantized aK-values for each station, originally
scaled on the assumption that ${\delta}$ values are constant, with
time-dependent scale factors that allow for the drift in ${\delta}$. This
requires revisiting the intercalibration of successive stations used in making
the $aa_S$ and $aa_N$ composites. These intercalibrations are defined using
independent data and daily averages from 11 years before and after each station
change and it is shown that they depend on the time of year. This procedure
produces new homogenized hemispheric aa indices, $aa_{HS}$ and $aa_{HN}$, which
show centennial-scale changes that are in very close agreement. Calibration
problems with the classic $aa$ index are shown to have arisen from drifts in
${\delta}$ combined with simpler corrections which gave an incorrect temporal

structure of resonant orbits on the Galactic plane created by the bar

by two resonant families already studied in a previous analysis. We show that
the observed U--V velocity field of the stars in both groups can be naturally
explained as a result of their trapping by these two resonant families, taking
the angular rotation speed of the bar approximately in the interval 45--60
$\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$. This analysis may help to understand the
identification of other known star groups as the possible result of the
interactions produced by resonances on stars close to resonant families. For
the two groups G18-39 and G21-22 we conclude that the majority of their stars

properties of a complex financial system (e.g. the implied level of systemic
risk) requires detailed information about the structure of the underlying
network. However, since data about financial linkages are typically subject to
confidentiality, network reconstruction techniques become necessary to infer
both the presence of connections and their intensity. Recently, several ""horse
races"" have been conducted to compare the performance of the available
financial network reconstruction methods. These comparisons, however, were
based on arbitrarily-chosen similarity metrics between the real and the
reconstructed network. Here we establish a generalised maximum-likelihood
approach to rigorously define and compare weighted reconstruction methods. Our
generalization maximizes the conditional entropy to solve the problem
represented by the fact that the density-dependent constraints required to
reliably reconstruct the network are typically unobserved. The resulting
approach admits as input any reconstruction method for the purely binary
topology and, conditionally on the latter, exploits the available partial
information to infer link weights. We find that the most reliable method is
obtained by ""dressing"" the best-performing binary method with an exponential
distribution of link weights having a properly density-corrected and
link-specific mean value and propose two unbiased (in the sense of maximum
conditional entropy) variants of it. While the one named CReMA is perfectly
general (as a particular case, it can place optimal weights on a network whose
topology is known), the one named CReMB is recommended both in case of full
uncertainty about the network topology and if the existence of some links is
certain. In these cases, the CReMB is faster and reproduces empirical networks
with highest generalised likelihood.

of TBG acquired at typical TEM electron energies of 80 - 300 keV exhibit the
diffraction peaks caused by diffraction on individual layers. However,
diffraction peaks at the scattering angles related to the periodicity of the
moire structure have not been observed in such diffraction patterns. We show
that diffraction on moire structure can create intense diffraction peaks if the
energy of the probing electrons is very low, in the range of a few tens of eV.
Experimental diffraction patterns of TBG acquired with low-energy electrons of
236 eV exhibiting peaks attributed to the moire structure periodicity are
shown. In holography mode, the intensity of the wave transmitted through the
sample and measured in the far-field can be enhanced or decreased depending on
the atomic arrangement, as for example AA or AB stacking. Thus, a decrease of
intensity in the far-field must not necessarily be associated with some
absorption inside the sample but can simply be a result of a particular atomic
arrangement. We believe that our findings can be important for exploiting
graphene as a support in electron imaging.

fault-tolerant quantum computation. The surface code uses only single- and
two-qubit gates and the error threshold falls close to 1% for a large range of
errors. Among the most promising candidates to physically implement such
circuits and codes are superconducting qubits coupled by resonators. We
investigate a X and Z stabilizing circuit realized by two data qubits, two
ancillas and four resonators. The aim is to assess the consequences of unitary
evolution of the interacting system, in particular for given stable initial
states, on fidelities and error syndrome probabilities. We model the system
with a Jaynes-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and construct the low-excitation level
evolution operators. The analysis is limited to two stable input states. We
assume an ideal system with perfect gates, perfect measurements and no
decoherence or leakage. Our analysis shows that the capture probabilities after
the execution of a single stabilizer round are not equal to 100%, but vary
between 99.2% and 99.99%. This is caused solely by the unitary evolution of the
interacting system. Two consecutive rounds of stabilizer measurements result in
capture probability values that depend heavily on the duration of the
evolution, but vary between 0% and 99%. Also due to the unitary evolution, the
final state of the data qubits leaves the the four-dimensional subspace, which
results in a state fidelity oscillating between 0 and 1. Even if an error on
the qubits is captured, the correcting operation on the qubit will not bring
the qubit to the original state. The errors induced by the Hamiltonian
evolution of the system cannot be interpreted nor classified as commonly
appearing errors. Additional or augmented quantum error correction may be
required to compensate these effects of resonator-qubit interaction.

coupled degenerate Fermi gas of $^{173}$Yb atoms. Using a differential optical
Stark shift, we split the degeneracy of three hyperfine states in the ground
manifold, and independently couple consecutive spin states with the equal Raman
transitions. A relatively long-lived spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gas, readily
being realized with a narrow optical transition, allows to explore a
single-minimum dispersion where three minima of spin-1 system merge into and to
monitor collective dipole modes of fermions in the strong coupling regime. The
measured oscillation frequency of the dipole mode is compared with the
semi-classical calculation in the single-particle regime. Our work should pave
the way towards the characterization of spin-orbit-coupled fermions with large
spin $s>\frac{1}{2}$ in the strong coupling regime.

typically learn a discriminative feature mapping, using a loss function that
enforces separation of features from different classes and/or aggregation of
features within the same class. However, they may suffer from bias in the
training data such as uneven sampling density, because they optimize the
adjacency relationship of the learned features without considering the
proximity of the underlying faces. Moreover, since they only use facial images
for training, the learned feature mapping may not correctly indicate the
relationship of other attributes such as gender and ethnicity, which can be
important for some face recognition applications. In this paper, we propose a
new CNN-based face recognition approach that incorporates such attributes into
the training process. Using an attribute-aware loss function that regularizes
the feature mapping using attribute proximity, our approach learns more
discriminative features that are correlated with the attributes. We train our
face recognition model on a large-scale RGB-D data set with over 100K
identities captured under real application conditions. By comparing our
approach with other methods on a variety of experiments, we demonstrate that
depth channel and attribute-aware loss greatly improve the accuracy and
robustness of face recognition.

system composed of a monochromatic light coupled to a two-band semiconductor
with direct band gap. The model Hamiltonian includes both photon-exciton and
exciton-exciton interactions. Time evolution of the relevant bosonic operators
are obtained analytically by using a perturbative technique that provides
operator solution for the coupled Heisenberg's equations of motion
corresponding to the system Hamiltonian. The bosonic operators are subsequently
used to study the possibilities of observing single and two mode squeezing and
antibunching after interaction in the relevant modes of light and
semiconductor. Further, entanglement between the exciton and photon modes is
reported. Finally, the nonclassical effects have been studied numerically for
the open quantum system scenario. In this situation, the nonlocal correlations
between two modes are shown to violate EPR steering inequality. The observed
nonclassical features, induced due to exciton-exciton pair interaction, can be
controlled by the phase of input field and the correlations between two modes

efficiency, and conclude on the interest of this technique for SBS limited high
power Er doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). The temperature increase caused by the
pump laser in the fiber core is also addressed.

crucial applications. The bulky and costly discrete optical components used in
conventional polarimeters limit their broad adoption. A compact, low-cost
polarimeter would bring this functionality into a myriad of new scenarios and
revolutionize its exploitation. Here we present a high-performance, full-Stokes
polarimeter on a silicon chip. A surface polarization splitter and on-chip
optical interferometer circuit produce the analysis matrix of an optimally
conditioned polarimeter. This solid-state polarimeter is a system-on-a-chip
with exceptional compactness, stability, and speed that could be used singly or
in integrated arrays. Large arrays can increase the speed and resolution of
full-Stokes imaging; therefore, our design provides a scalable polarimeter
solution.
