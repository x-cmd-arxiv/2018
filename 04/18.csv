  Modified Theories of Gravity","31 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We carry out a dynamical analysis of first order perturbations for Cold Dark
Matter, $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter, and a couple of Modified Gravity models
using the Parametrized Post-Friedmann formalism. We use normalized variables to
set the proper dynamical system of equations through which we make the analysis
in order to shed some light on the dynamics of such perturbations inside these
models. For Modified Gravity models, we use the scale-independent and
-dependent parametrizations, in particular, two $f(R)$ and two Chameleon-like
models are considered within the quasi-static approximation. Given the employed
formalism, we found that the critical points and stability features of the
dynamical systems for Modified Gravity models are the same as those found in
the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model. However, the behavior around the
critical points suffers important modifications in some specific cases. We
explicitly find that signatures of these Modified Gravity models mainly arise
on the velocity perturbations, while the density contrast and the curvature
potentials turn out to be less sensitive to the parametrization taken into
consideration. We also provide a percentage estimation of the extent of
modification in the perturbations in the Modified Gravity models considered in
comparison to the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model along the expansion
history and for a couple of wavenumbers.

a characterization of $(\mathcal{P},L)$-critical hypergraphs. Those are

finding rely on the graphical analysis of the observed distribution of

piece of evidence nor their concurrent observation robustly proves that the
thermal and superthermal mixture fits the observed distribution of incomes
better than reasonable alternatives. A formal analysis using popular measures
of fit shows that while an exponential distribution with a power-law tail
provides a better fit of the IRS income data than the log-normal distribution
(often assumed by economists), the thermal and superthermal mixture's fit can
be improved upon further by adding a log-normal component. The economic
implications of the thermal and superthermal distribution of incomes, and the
expanded mixture are explored in the paper.

development mechanism of continuous material accumulation that expresses

adaptation through material accumulation remains an open challenge. In this
paper, we present a novel type of biologically inspired modularity, and an
approach to artificial growth that combines the benefits of material continuity
through braiding with a distributed and decentralised plant-inspired Vascular
Morphogenesis Controller (VMC). The controller runs on nodes that are capable
of sensing and communicating with their neighbours. The nodes are embedded
within the braided structure, which can be morphologically adapted based on
collective decision making between nodes. Human agents realise the material
adaptation by physically adding to the braided structure according to the
suggestion of the embedded controller. This work offers a novel, tangible and
accessible approach to embedding mechanisms of artificial growth and
morphological adaptation within physically embodied systems, offering radically
new functionalities, innovation potentials and approaches to continuous
autonomous or steered design that could find application within fields

can experience significant induction heating in their interiors caused by the
planet's orbital motion. For induction heating to be substantial, the planetary
orbit has to be inclined with respect to the stellar rotation and dipole axes.
Using WX~UMa, for which the rotation and magnetic axes are aligned, as an
example, we show that for close-in planets on inclined orbits, induction
heating can be stronger than the tidal heating occurring inside Jupiter's
satellite Io; namely, it can generate a surface heat flux exceeding
2\,W\,m$^{-2}$. An internal heating source of such magnitude can lead to
extreme volcanic activity on the planet's surface, possibly also to internal
local magma oceans, and to the formation of a plasma torus around the star
aligned with the planetary orbit. A strongly volcanically active planet would
eject into space mostly SO$_2$, which would then dissociate into oxygen and
sulphur atoms. Young planets would also eject CO$_2$. Oxygen would therefore be
the major component of the torus. If the O{\sc i} column density of the torus
exceeds $\approx$10$^{12}$\,cm$^{-2}$, the torus could be revealed by detecting
absorption signatures at the position of the strong far-ultraviolet O{\sc i}
triplet at about 1304\,\AA. We estimate that this condition is satisfied if the
O{\sc i} atoms in the torus escape the system at a velocity smaller than
1--10\,km\,s$^{-1}$. These estimates are valid also for a tidally heated
planet.

energetic turbulent flow whose lengthscales are similar to the wavelengths.
Advection and refraction by this flow cause the scattering of the waves,
redistributing their energy in wavevector space. As a result, initially plane
waves radiated from a source such as a topographic ridge become spatially
incoherent away from the source. To examine this process, we derive a kinetic
equation which describes the statistics of the scattering under the assumptions
that the flow is quasigeostrophic, barotropic, and well represented by a
stationary homogeneous random field. Energy transfers are quantified by
computing a scattering cross section and shown to be restricted to waves with
the same frequency and identical vertical structure, hence the same horizontal
wavelength. For isotropic flows, scattering leads to an isotropic wavefield. We
estimate the characteristic time and length scales of this isotropisation, and
study their dependence on parameters including the energy spectrum of the flow.
Simulations of internal tides generated by a planar wavemaker carried out for
the linearised shallow-water model confirm the pertinence of these scales. A
comparison with the numerical solution of the kinetic equation demonstrates the
validity of the latter and illustrates how the interplay between wave
scattering and transport shapes the wave statistics.

particles on a substrate. An important consequence of the non-equilibrium drive
is the spontaneous motility of strength +1/2 disclinations. Starting from the
hydrodynamic equations of active nematics, we derive an interacting particle
description of defects that includes active torques. We show that activity,
within perturbation theory, lowers the defect-unbinding transition temperature,
determining a critical line in the temperature-activity plane that separates
the quasi-long-range ordered (nematic) and disordered (isotropic) phases. Below
a critical activity, defects remain bound as rotational noise decorrelates the
directed dynamics of +1/2 defects, stabilizing the quasi-long-range ordered
nematic state. This activity threshold vanishes at low temperature, leading to
a re-entrant transition. At large enough activity, active forces always exceed
thermal ones and the perturbative result fails, suggesting that in this regime
activity will always disorder the system. Crucially, rotational diffusion being
a two-dimensional phenomenon, defect unbinding cannot be described by a
simplified one-dimensional model.

every fibration of $\mathcal{C}$-diagrams admits a well-behaved minimal model.
As a consequence, we establish a classification theorem for fibrations in
$\mathbf{S}^\mathcal{C}$ over a constant diagram, generalizing the
classification theorem of Barratt, Gugenheim, and Moore for simplicial
fibrations.

  Maximization without Loss in Approximation",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the adaptivity of submodular maximization. Adaptivity
quantifies the number of sequential rounds that an algorithm makes when
function evaluations can be executed in parallel. Adaptivity is a fundamental
concept that is heavily studied across a variety of areas in computer science,
largely due to the need for parallelizing computation. For the canonical
problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality
constraint, it is well known that a simple greedy algorithm achieves a $1-1/e$
approximation and that this approximation is optimal for polynomial-time
algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, despite extensive efforts on submodular
optimization for large-scale datasets, until very recently there was no known
algorithm that achieves a constant factor approximation for this problem whose
adaptivity is sublinear in the size of the ground set $n$.
  Recent work by Balkanski and Singer describes an algorithm that obtains an
approximation arbitrarily close to $1/3$ in $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ adaptive
rounds and shows that no algorithm can obtain a constant factor approximation
in $\tilde{o}(\log n)$ adaptive rounds. This approach achieves an exponential
speedup in adaptivity (and parallel running time) at the expense of
approximation quality.
  In this paper we describe a novel approach that yields an algorithm whose
approximation is arbitrarily close to the optimal $1-1/e$ guarantee in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ adaptive rounds. This algorithm therefore achieves an
exponential speedup in parallel running time for submodular maximization at the
expense of an arbitrarily small loss in approximation quality. This guarantee
is optimal in both approximation and adaptivity, up to lower order terms.

double logarithmic correction related to the zero temperature susceptibility.

tour of $n$ cities that visits each city $c$ a prescribed number $k_c$ of

incur a non-zero cost. The MV-TSP problem finds applications in scheduling,
geometric approximation, and Hamiltonicity of certain graph families.
  The fastest known algorithm for MV-TSP is due to Cosmadakis and Papadimitriou
(SICOMP, 1984). It runs in time $n^{O(n)} + O(n^3 \log \sum_c k_c )$ and
requires $n^{\Theta(n)}$ space. An interesting feature of the
Cosmadakis-Papadimitriou algorithm is its \emph{logarithmic} dependence on the
total length $\sum_c k_c$ of the tour, allowing the algorithm to handle
instances with very long tours. The \emph{superexponential} dependence on the
number of cities in both the time and space complexity, however, renders the
algorithm impractical for all but the narrowest range of this parameter.
  In this paper we improve upon the Cosmadakis-Papadimitriou algorithm, giving
an MV-TSP algorithm that runs in time $2^{O(n)}$, i.e.\
\emph{single-exponential} in the number of cities, using \emph{polynomial}
space. Our algorithm is deterministic, and arguably both simpler and easier to
analyse than the original approach of Cosmadakis and Papadimitriou. It involves
an optimization over directed spanning trees and a recursive, centroid-based
decomposition of trees.

iterative solution process, while the solution in the faulty domain is
re-constructed by an asynchronous on-line recovery. The computations in both

ability to infer textured 3D model from a single image is at the core of visual
understanding. Here, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework, Colorful
Voxel Network (CVN), to tackle this problem. Conditioned on a single 2D input,
CVN learns to decompose shape and surface color information of a 3D object into
a 3D shape branch and a surface color branch, respectively. Specifically, for
the shape recovery, we generate a shape volume with the state of its voxels
indicating occupancy. For the surface color recovery, we combine the strength
of appearance hallucination and geometric projection by concurrently learning a
regressed color volume and a 2D-to-3D flow volume, which are then fused into a
blended color volume. The final textured 3D model is obtained by sampling color
from the blended color volume at the positions of occupied voxels in the shape
volume. To handle the severe sparse volume representations, a novel loss
function, Mean Squared False Cross-Entropy Loss (MSFCEL), is designed.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant
improvement over baselines, and shows great generalization across diverse

presence of crystalline material inside its gap while the silicate feature of
CVSO-109 is characterized by a pristine profile produced by amorphous
silicates; the mechanisms creating the optically thin dust seem to depend on
disk local conditions. Using millimeter photometry we estimated dust disk

components and by the mechanism that combines them. A common way to achieve the
consensus is to enable each component to equally participate in the aggregation
process. A problem with this approach is that poor components are likely to
negatively affect the quality of the consensus result. To address this issue,
alternatives have been explored in the literature to build selective classifier
and cluster ensembles, where only a subset of the components contributes to the
computation of the consensus. Of the family of ensemble methods, outlier
ensembles are the least studied. Only recently, the selection problem for
outlier ensembles has been discussed. In this work we define a new graph-based
class of ranking selection methods. A method in this class is characterized by
two main steps: (1) Mapping the rankings onto a graph structure; and (2) Mining
the resulting graph to identify a subset of rankings. We define a specific
instance of the graph-based ranking selection class. Specifically, we map the
problem of selecting ensemble components onto a mining problem in a graph. An
extensive evaluation was conducted on a variety of heterogeneous data and
methods. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art selective outlier ensemble techniques.

metallicity bins for each of these age groups. We find significant differences
in kinematic trends of young and old, metal-poor and metal-rich, stellar
populations. In particular, we find a strong metallicity dependence in the mean
Galactocentric radial velocity as a function of radius ($\partial {V_{\rm

these findings as correlations between metallicity and the relative
contributions of the non-axisymmetries in the Galactic gravitational potential

Previous studies had correlated the occurrence of anomalous diffusion to either
the random properties of the scattering medium or to the presence of localized
disorder. In this study, we show that anomalous diffusive transport can occur
also in perfectly periodic media and in the absence of disorder. The analysis
of the fundamental physical mechanism leading to this unexpected behavior is
performed via a combination of deterministic, stochastic, and fractional-order
models in order to capture the different elements contributing to this
phenomenon. Results indicate that this anomalous transport can indeed occur in
perfectly periodic media when the dispersion behavior is characterized by
anisotropic (partial) bandgaps. In selected frequency ranges, the propagation
of acoustic waves not only becomes diffusive but its intensity distribution
acquires a distinctive L\'evy alpha-stable profile having pronounced
heavy-tails. In these ranges, the acoustic transport in the medium occurs
according to a hybrid transport mechanism which is simultaneously propagating
and anomalously diffusive. We show that such behavior is well captured by a
fractional diffusive transport model whose order can be obtained by the
analysis of the heavy tails.

observed so far in submillimetre observations of high-z QSOs. It is only 2.2
kpc distant and merging with J1015+0020, while two other [CII] emitters are
found at 8 and 17 kpc. Two strong continuum emitters are also detected at <3.5
arcsec. They are likely associated to the same overdense structure of
J1015+0020, as they exceed by a factor of 100 the number of expected sources,
considering the Log(N)-Log(S) at 850 um. The host galaxy of J1015+0020 shows a
SFR of about 100 Msun/yr while the total SFR of the QSO and its companion
galaxies is a factor of 10 higher, indicating that substantial stellar mass
assembly at early epochs may have taken place in the QSO satellites. For
J1015+0020 we compute a SMBH mass MBH~6E9 Msun and a dynamical mass Mdyn~4E10
Msun . This translates into an extreme ratio Mdyn/MBH~7. The total stellar mass
of the QSO host galaxy plus the [CII] emitters already exceeds 1E11 Msun at

1.3E12 Msun. Under the assumption of constant mass or Eddington accretion rate
equal to the observed values, we find that the growth timescale of the host
galaxy is comparable or even shorter than that inferred for the SMBH.

produces significant lensing biases, which cannot be fully controlled by
multi-frequency component separation, masking or bias hardening. In this
letter, we split the standard CMB lensing quadratic estimator into a new set of
optimal ""multipole"" estimators. On large scales, these multipole estimators
reduce to the known magnification and shear estimators, and a new shear B-mode
estimator. We leverage the different symmetries of the lensed CMB and
extragalactic foregrounds to argue that the shear-only estimator should be
approximately immune to extragalactic foregrounds. We build a new method to
compute separately and without noise the primary, secondary and trispectrum
biases to CMB lensing from foreground simulations. Using this method, we
demonstrate that the shear estimator is indeed insensitive to extragalactic
foregrounds, even when applied to a single-frequency temperature map
contaminated with CIB, tSZ, kSZ and radio point sources. This dramatic
reduction in foreground biases allows us to include higher temperature
multipoles than with the standard quadratic estimator, thus increasing the
total lensing signal-to-noise beyond the quadratic estimator. In addition,
magnification-only and shear B-mode estimators provide useful diagnostics for
potential residuals. Our Python code LensQuEst to forecast the signal-to-noise

simple theoretical framework for the chemical evolution based on the
instantaneous recycling approximation (IRA) model. We infer a CEH from a SFH

for the evolution of individual chemical elements which takes into account the

$\alpha$-element abundances of 15 star clusters derived from fitting of their

well with the observed cluster age-metallicity relation. Moreover, the present

through mergers with other sink particles, and a stiff equation of state that
leads to the formation of an adiabatic core. We impose threshold densities of
$10^8$, $10^{10}$, and $10^{12}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ for the sink particle

four two-temperature general relativistic radiative magnetohydrodynamic
(GRRMHD) simulations of Sgr A* performed with the code KORAL. These simulations
use different electron heating prescriptions, motivated by different models of
the underlying plasma microphysics. We compare the Landau-damped turbulent
cascade model used in previous work with a new prescription we introduce based
on the results of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. With
the turbulent heating model, electrons are preferentially heated in the polar
outflow, whereas with the reconnection model electrons are heated by nearly the
same fraction everywhere in the accretion flow. The spectra of the two models
are similar around the submillimetre synchrotron peak, but the models heated by
magnetic reconnection produce variability more consistent with the level
observed from Sgr A*. All models produce 230~GHz images with distinct black
hole shadows which are consistent with the image size measured by the Event
Horizon Telescope, but only the turbulent heating produces an anisotropic
`disc-jet' structure where the image is dominated by a polar outflow or jet at
frequencies below the synchrotron peak. None of our models can reproduce the
observed radio spectral slope, the large near-infrared and X-ray flares, or the
near-infrared spectral index, all of which suggest non-thermal electrons are

often referred to as the Humphreys-Davidson limit, is thought to encode
information on the general mass-loss behaviour of massive stars. Further, it
delineates the boundary at which single stars will end their lives stripped of
their hydrogen-rich envelope, which in turn is a key factor in the relative
rates of Type-II to Type-Ibc supernovae from single star channels. In this
paper we have revisited the issue of $L_{\rm max}$ by studying the luminosity
distributions of cool supergiants (SGs) in the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds (LMC/SMC). We assemble samples of cool SGs in each galaxy which are
highly-complete above $\log L/L_{\odot}$=5.0, and determine their spectral
energy distributions from the optical to the mid-infrared using modern
multi-wavelength survey data. We show that in both cases $L_{\rm max}$ appears
to be lower than previously quoted, and is in the region of $\log
L/L_{\odot}$=5.5. There is no evidence for $L_{\rm max}$ being higher in the
SMC than in the LMC, as would be expected if metallicity-dependent winds were
the dominant factor in the stripping of stellar envelopes. We also show that
$L_{\rm max}$ aligns with the lowest luminosity of single nitrogen-rich
Wolf-Rayet stars, indicating of a change in evolutionary sequence for stars
above a critical mass. From population synthesis analysis we show that the
Geneva evolutionary models greatly over-predict the numbers of cool SGs in the
SMC. We also argue that the trend of earlier average spectral types of cool SGs
in lower metallicity environments represents a genuine shift to hotter
temperatures. Finally, we use our new bolometric luminosity measurements to
provide updated bolometric corrections for cool supergiants.

direction is proven. A particle system is introduced, its interaction with the
fluid is modelled and tightness is proved, in a suitable topology, for the
family of laws of the pair composed by solution of Navier-Stokes equations and
empirical measure of the particles. Moreover, it is proved that every limit law
is supported on weak solutions of the Vlasov-Navier- Stokes system. Open
problems, like weak-strong uniqueness for this system and its relevance for the
convergence of the particle system, are outlined.

in the group of a large elliptical galaxy, NGC1052. Compared to expectations
from abundance matching models, the dark matter mass contained in NGC1052-DF2
is smaller by a factor of $\sim 400$. We utilize controlled $N$-body
simulations of the tidal interaction between NGC1052 and a smaller satellite
galaxy, that we suppose as the progenitor of NGC1052-DF2, to test if tidal
stripping can explain dark-matter deficiency at such levels. We find that when
assuming a tightly bound and quite radial orbit and cored density structure for
the dark halo of the satellite, our simulations reproduce well both the mass
profile and the effective radius inferred from the observations of NGC1052-DF2.
Orbital parameters are in the tail, but still consistent with measurements of
their distributions from cosmological simulations. Such strongly dark-matter
deficient galaxies, in our scenario, are thus expected to be relatively rare in

waves are produced here by gravity waves from nonlinear wave interactions.
Using a spatio-temporal measurement of the free-surface, we characterize
statistically the random regimes of capillary waves in the spatial and temporal
Fourier spaces. For a significant wave steepness ($0.2-0.3$), power-law spectra
are observed both in space and time, defining a turbulent regime of capillary
waves transferring energy from large scale to small scale. Analysis of temporal
fluctuations of spatial spectrum demonstrates that the capillary power-law
spectra result from the temporal averaging over intermittent and strong
nonlinear events transferring energy to small scale in a fast time scale, when
capillary wave trains are generated in a way similar to the parasitic capillary
wave generation mechanism. The frequency and wavenumber power-law exponents of
wave spectrum are found to be in agreement with those of the weakly nonlinear
Wave Turbulence Theory. However, the energy flux is not constant through the
scales and the wave spectrum scaling with this flux is not in good agreement
with Wave Turbulence Theory. These results suggest that theoretical
developments beyond the classic Wave Turbulence Theory are necessary to
describe the dynamics and statistics of capillary waves in natural environment.
In particular, in presence of broad scale viscous dissipation and strong
nonlinearity, the role of non-local and non-resonant interactions could be
reconsidered.

evidence for warping, and significant truncation on the side facing the SMC.
Large diffuse stellar substructures are present both to the north and south of
the LMC, and in the inter-Cloud region. At least one of these features appears
co-spatial with the bridge of RR Lyrae stars that connects the Clouds. The SMC
is highly disturbed -- we confirm the presence of tidal tails, as well as a
large line-of-sight depth on the side closest to the LMC. Young,
intermediate-age, and ancient stellar populations in the SMC exhibit strikingly
different spatial distributions. In particular, those with ages $\sim$ 1.5-4
Gyr exhibit a spheroidal distribution with a centroid offset from that of the
oldest stars by several degrees towards the LMC. We speculate that the
gravitational influence of the LMC may already have been perturbing the gaseous
component of the SMC several Gyr ago. With careful modeling, the variety of
substructures and tidal distortions evident in the Magellanic periphery should
tightly constrain the interaction history of the Clouds.

exchange of baryonic number with the vacuum condensate engenders what may be
observed as neutron-antineutron oscillation. The convergence between the

oscillations is shown by the calculation of the anomalous (baryon-number

and their combination, to distinguish between language samples from AD and
control patients. We achieve a new independent benchmark accuracy for the AD
classification task. More importantly, we next interpret what these neural
models have learned about the linguistic characteristics of AD patients, via
analysis based on activation clustering and first-derivative saliency
techniques. We then perform novel automatic pattern discovery inside activation
clusters, and consolidate AD patients' distinctive grammar patterns.
Additionally, we show that first derivative saliency can not only rediscover
previous language patterns of AD patients, but also shed light on the
limitations of neural models. Lastly, we also include analysis of
gender-separated AD data.

anchor important secondary stellar age indicators. Recent studies have shown
that main sequence turn off-based ages for these clusters may depend on the
degree of rotation in the underlying stellar models. Rotation induces
structural instabilities that can enhance the chemical mixing of a star,
extending its fuel supply. In addition, rotation introduces a modulation of the
star's observed magnitude and color due to the effects of gravity darkening. We
aim to investigate the extent to which stellar rotation affects the age
determination of star clusters. We utilize the MESA stellar evolution code to
create models that cover a range of rotation rates corresponding to
$\Omega/\Omega_c=0.0$ to $0.6$ in $0.1$ dex steps, allowing the assessment of
variations in this dimension. The statistical analysis package, MATCH, is
employed to derive ages and metallicities by fitting our MESA models to Tycho
$B_T$, $V_T$ and 2MASS $J$, $K_s$ color-magnitude diagrams. We find that the
derived ages are relatively insensitive to the effects of rotation. For the
Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades, we derive ages based on synthetic populations
that model a distribution of rotation rates or a fixed rate. Across each case,
derived ages tend to agree roughly within errors, near $680$, $590$, and
$110-160$ Myr for the Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades, respectively. These ages
are in agreement with Li depletion boundary-based ages and previous analyses
that used non-rotating isochrones. Our methods do not provide a strong
constraint on the metallicities of these clusters.

that the solidification process can be decomposed into multiple time regimes,

the space elevator, is the unavailability of materials with sufficient tensile
strength. The presumed necessity of very strong materials stems from a design
paradigm which requires structures to operate at a small fraction of their
maximum tensile strength (usually, 50% or less). This criterion limits the
probability of failure by giving structures sufficient leeway in handling
stochastic components, such as variability in material strength and/or external
forces. While reasonable for typical engineering structures, low working stress
ratios --- defined as operating stress as a fraction of ultimate tensile
strength --- in the case of megastructures are both too stringent and unable to
adequately control the failure probability. We draw inspiration from natural
biological structures, such as bones, tendons and ligaments, which are made up
of smaller substructures and exhibit self-repair, and suggest a design that
requires structures to operate at significantly higher stress ratios, while
maintaining reliability through a continuous repair mechanism. We outline a
mathematical framework for analysing the reliability of structures with
components exhibiting probabilistic rupture and repair that depend on their
time-in-use (age). Further, we predict time-to-failure distributions for the
overall structure. We then apply this framework to the space elevator and find
that a high degree of reliability is achievable using currently existing
materials, provided it operates at sufficiently high working stress ratios,
sustained through an autonomous repair mechanism, implemented via, e.g.,
robots.

design and improves data efficiency by performing multiple epochs of
\emph{clipped policy optimization} from sampled data. Although clipping in PPO
stands for an important new mechanism for efficient and reliable policy update,
it may fail to adaptively improve learning performance in accordance with the
importance of each sampled state. To address this issue, a new surrogate
learning objective featuring an adaptive clipping mechanism is proposed in this
paper, enabling us to develop a new algorithm, known as PPO-$\lambda$.
PPO-$\lambda$ optimizes policies repeatedly based on a theoretical target for
adaptive policy improvement. Meanwhile, destructively large policy update can
be effectively prevented through both clipping and adaptive control of a
hyperparameter $\lambda$ in PPO-$\lambda$, ensuring high learning reliability.
PPO-$\lambda$ enjoys the same simple and efficient design as PPO. Empirically

by using emissions taxes or other regulatory interventions to reduce greenhouse

Weighted Sum Bisection method to determine the lowest emission tax rate that
can reduce the anticipated emissions of the power sector below a prescribed,
regulatorily-defined target. This bi-level method accounts for a variety of
operating conditions via stochastic programming and remains computationally
tractable for realistically large planning test systems, even when binary
commitment decisions and multi-period constraints on conventional generators
are considered.
  Case studies on a modified ISO New England test system demonstrate that this
method reliably finds the minimum tax rate that meets emissions targets. In
addition, it investigates the relationship between system investments and the
tax-setting process. Introducing GHG emissions taxes increases the value
proposition for investment in new cleaner generation, transmission, and energy
efficiency; conversely, investing in these technologies reduces the tax rate
required to reach a given emissions target.

Fredholm integral eigenvalue problem, enabling random field discretization by
means of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. The method involves a Galerkin
projection onto a finite-dimensional subspace of a Hilbert space, basis splines
(B-splines) and non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) spanning the subspace,
and standard methods of eigensolutions. Compared with the existing Galerkin
methods, such as the finite-element and mesh-free methods, the NURBS-based
isogeometric method upholds exact geometrical representation of the physical or
computational domain and exploits regularity of basis functions delivering
globally smooth eigensolutions. Therefore, the introduction of the isogeometric
method for random field discretization is not only new; it also offers a few
computational advantages over existing methods. In the big picture, the use of
NURBS for random field discretization enriches the isogeometric paradigm. As a
result, an uncertainty quantification pipeline of the future can be envisioned
where geometric modeling, stress analysis, and stochastic simulation are all
integrated using the same building blocks of NURBS. Three numerical examples,
including a three-dimensional random field discretization problem, illustrate
the accuracy and convergence properties of the isogeometric method for
obtaining eigensolutions.

properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), an extremely hot and dense state of
fluid-like matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
  The QGP cannot be directly observed -- it is extraordinarily tiny and
ephemeral, about $10^{-14}$ meters in size and living $10^{-23}$ seconds before
freezing into discrete particles -- but it can be indirectly characterized by
matching the output of a computational collision model to experimental
observations. The model, which takes the QGP properties of interest as input
parameters, is calibrated to fit the experimental data, thereby extracting a
posterior probability distribution for the parameters.
  In this dissertation, I construct a specific computational model of heavy-ion
collisions and formulate the Bayesian parameter estimation method, which is
based on general statistical techniques. I then apply these tools to estimate
fundamental QGP properties, including its key transport coefficients and
characteristics of the initial state of heavy-ion collisions.
  Perhaps most notably, I report the most precise estimate to date of the
temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$, the measurement of
which is a primary goal of heavy-ion physics. The estimated minimum value is
$\eta/s = 0.085_{-0.025}^{+0.026}$ (posterior median and 90% uncertainty),
remarkably close to the conjectured lower bound of $1/4\pi \simeq 0.08$. The
analysis also shows that $\eta/s$ likely increases slowly as a function of
temperature.
  Other estimated quantities include the temperature-dependent bulk viscosity
$\zeta/s$, the scaling of initial state entropy deposition, and the duration of
the pre-equilibrium stage that precedes QGP formation.

X-ray and MIR selected clusters display very similar surface brightness
distributions of galaxy MIR light. In addition, the average location and
amplitude of the galaxy red sequence as measured from stacked colour histograms
is very similar in the X-ray and MIR-selected samples. The sub-sample of X-ray
faint, MIR bright clusters displays a distribution of BCG-barycentre position
offsets which extends to higher values than all other samples. This observation
indicates that such clusters may exist in a more disturbed state compared to
the majority of the distant cluster population sampled by XMM-LSS and SpARCS.
This conclusion is supported by stacked X-ray images for the X-ray faint, MIR

into intermediate or, in rare cases, possibly supermassive black holes. We use
the Renaissance simulation suite to follow the growth of over 15,000 black
holes born into mini-haloes in the early Universe. We compute the evolution of
the black holes by post-processing individual remnant Population III star
particles in the Renaissance simulation snapshots. The black holes populate
haloes from 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ up to 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find that all
of the black holes display very inefficient growth. On average the black holes
increase their initial mass by a factor 10$^{-5}$, with the most active black
holes increasing their mass by approximately 10%. Only a single black hole
experiences any period of super-Eddington accretion, but the duration is very
short and not repeated. Furthermore, we find no correlation of black hole
accretion with halo mass in the mass range sampled. Within most haloes, we
identify clumps of cool, dense gas for which accretion rates would be high, but
instances of black holes encountering these clumps are rare and short-lived.
Star formation competes with black hole growth by consuming available gas and
driving down accretion rates through feedback. We conclude that the black holes
born from Population III remnants do not form a significant population of
intermediate mass black holes in the early Universe and will need to wait until
later times to undergo significant accretion, if at all.

Previous
ALMA observations revealed a CO belt at $\sim$85 au with a distinct clump,
interpreted as a location of enhanced gas production. Photodissociation
converts CO into C and O within $\sim$50 years. We resolve CI emission at 492
GHz using ALMA and study its spatial distribution. CI shows the same clump as
seen for CO. This is surprising, as C is expected to quickly spread in azimuth.
We derive a low C mass (between $5\times10^{-4}$ and $3.1\times10^{-3}$
M$_\oplus$), indicating that gas production started only recently (within
$\sim$5000 years). No evidence is seen for an atomic accretion disk inwards of
the CO belt, perhaps because the gas did not yet have time to spread radially.
The fact that C and CO share the same asymmetry argues against a previously
proposed scenario where the clump is due to an outward migrating planet
trapping planetesimals in an resonance; nor can the observations be explained
by an eccentric planetesimal belt secularly forced by a planet. Instead, we
suggest that the dust and gas disks should be eccentric. Such a configuration,
we further speculate, might be produced by a recent tidal disruption event.
Assuming that the disrupted body has had a CO mass fraction of 10%, its total

existing works in crowdsourcing mainly focus on label inference and incentive
design. In this paper, we address a different problem of adaptive crowd
teaching, which is a sub-area of machine teaching in the context of
crowdsourcing. Compared with machines, human beings are extremely good at
learning a specific target concept (e.g., classifying the images into given
categories) and they can also easily transfer the learned concepts into similar
learning tasks. Therefore, a more effective way of utilizing crowdsourcing is
by supervising the crowd to label in the form of teaching. In order to perform
the teaching and expertise estimation simultaneously, we propose an adaptive
teaching framework named JEDI to construct the personalized optimal teaching
set for the crowdsourcing workers. In JEDI teaching, the teacher assumes that
each learner has an exponentially decayed memory. Furthermore, it ensures
comprehensiveness in the learning process by carefully balancing teaching
diversity and learner's accurate learning in terms of teaching usefulness.
Finally, we validate the effectiveness and efficacy of JEDI teaching in
comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques on multiple data sets with both

G328.2551-0.5321. It exhibits a bolometric luminosity of 1.3$\times$10$^4$
L$_{\odot}$ corresponding to a current protostellar mass of $\sim$11 and 16
M$_{\odot}$. We analyze high angular-resolution observations with ALMA at
$\sim$0.17"" corresponding a physical scale of $\sim$400 au in dust continuum
and molecular lines. The dust continuum emission reveals a single high-mass
protostellar envelope and shows evidence for a marginally resolved continuum
source. We detect a rotational line of CH$_3$OH within its $v_{\rm t}$=1
torsionally excited state revealing two bright peaks of emission spatially
offset from the dust continuum peak, and exhibiting a distinct velocity
component $\pm$4.5 km s$^{-1}$ offset compared to the source $v_{\rm lsr}$.
Local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis suggests
N(CH$_3$OH)=1.2$-$2$\times$10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and kinetic temperatures of
160$-$200 K at the position of these peaks. Their velocity shifts correspond
well to the expected Keplerian velocity around a central object with
15M$_{\odot}$ consistent with the mass estimate based on the source's
bolometric luminosity. We propose a picture where the CH$_3$OH emission peaks
trace the accretion shocks around the centrifugal barrier, pinpointing the
interaction region between the collapsing envelope and an accretion disk.
Because the HC$_3$N $v_{\rm 7}$=1e ($J$=38-37) line shows compact emission, and
a velocity pattern consistent with models of Keplerian rotation, we suggest
that this could be a new tracer for compact accretion disks around high-mass
protostars. The estimated physical properties of the accretion disk suggest a
specific angular momentum several times larger than typically observed towards
low-mass protostars.

Young Cluster Survey. Existing membership catalogs span limited portions of the
OSFC, reflecting the difficulty of selecting targets homogeneously across this
extended, highly structured region. We have used data from wide field
photometric surveys to produce a less biased parent sample of young stellar
objects (YSOs) with infrared (IR) excesses indicative of warm circumstellar
material or photometric variability at optical wavelengths across the full 420
square degrees extent of the OSFC. When restricted to YSO candidates with H <
12.4, to ensure S/N ~100 for a six visit source, this uniformly selected sample
includes 1307 IR excess sources selected using criteria vetted by Koenig &
Liesawitz and 990 optical variables identified in the Pan-STARRS1 3$\pi$
survey: 319 sources exhibit both optical variability and evidence of
circumstellar disks through IR excess. Objects from this uniformly selected
sample received the highest priority for targeting, but required fewer than
half of the fibers on each APOGEE-2 plate. We fill the remaining fibers with
previously confirmed and new color-magnitude selected candidate OSFC members.
Radial velocity measurements from APOGEE-1 and new APOGEE-2 observations taken
in the survey's first year indicate that ~90% of the uniformly selected targets
have radial velocities consistent with Orion membership.The APOGEE-2 Orion
survey will include >1100 bona fide YSOs whose uniform selection function will
provide a robust sample for comparative analyses of the stellar populations and
properties across all sub-regions of Orion.

in order to accommodate simultaneous access by multiple users as well as
increase the fault tolerance of the system. Recent cloud storage research has
proposed using availability codes, which is a special class of erasure codes,
as a more storage efficient way to store hot data. These codes enable data
recovery from multiple, small disjoint groups of servers. The number of the
recovery groups is referred to as the availability and the size of each group
as the locality of the code. Until now, we have very limited knowledge on how
code locality and availability affect data access time. Data download from
these systems involves multiple fork-join queues operating in-parallel, making
the analysis of access time a very challenging problem. In this paper, we
present an approximate analysis of data access time in storage systems that
employ simplex codes, which are an important and in certain sense optimal class
of availability codes. We consider and compare three strategies in assigning
download requests to servers; first one aggressively exploits the storage
availability for faster download, second one implements only load balancing,
and the last one employs storage availability only for hot data download
without incurring any negative impact on the cold data download.

field reconstruction based on the field's measurements collected at two
different scales, the coarse and fine scales. The proposed approach treats the
parameter field defined at fine and coarse scales as a bivariate Gaussian
process with a parameterized multiscale covariance model. We employ a full
bivariate Mat\'{e}rn kernel as multiscale covariance model, with shape and
smoothness hyperparameters that account for the coarsening relation between
fine and coarse fields. In contrast to similar multiscale kriging approaches
that assume a known coarsening relation between scales, the hyperparameters of
the multiscale covariance model are estimated directly from data via
pseudo-likelihood maximization.
  We illustrate the proposed approach with a predictive simulation application
for saturated flow in porous media. Multiscale Gaussian process regression is
employed to estimate two-dimensional log-saturated hydraulic conductivity
distributions from synthetic multiscale measurements. The resulting stochastic
model for coarse saturated conductivity is employed to quantify and reduce
uncertainty in pressure predictions.

other star-forming galaxies on the SFR-MH2 plot (051022, 060505, 080207, and

GRB hosts are not deep enough to judge whether they are molecule deficient
(000418, 030329, 031203, and 090423). The median value of the molecular gas
depletion time, MH2/SFR, of GRB hosts is ~0.3 dex below that of other
star-forming galaxies, but this result has low statistical significance. A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed on MH2/SFR shows an only ~2sigma difference
between GRB hosts and other galaxies. This difference can partly be explained
by metallicity effects, since the significance decreases to ~1sigma for MH2/SFR
versus~metallicity. We found that any molecular gas deficiency of GRB hosts has
low statistical significance and that it can be attributed to their lower
metallicities; and thus the sample of GRB hosts has molecular properties that
are consistent with those of other galaxies, and they can be treated as
representative star-forming galaxies. Given the concentration of atomic gas
recently found close to GRB and supernova sites, indicating recent gas inflow,
our results about the weak molecular deficiency imply that such an inflow does
not enhance the SFRs significantly, or that atomic gas converts efficiently
into the molecular phase, which fuels star formation.

the machine learning community, with applications including Neyman-Pearson
classification, robust optimization, and fair machine learning. A natural
approach to constrained optimization is to optimize the Lagrangian, but this is
not guaranteed to work in the non-convex setting, and, if using a first-order
method, cannot cope with non-differentiable constraints (e.g. constraints on
rates or proportions).
  The Lagrangian can be interpreted as a two-player game played between a
player who seeks to optimize over the model parameters, and a player who wishes
to maximize over the Lagrange multipliers. We propose a non-zero-sum variant of
the Lagrangian formulation that can cope with non-differentiable--even
discontinuous--constraints, which we call the ""proxy-Lagrangian"". The first
player minimizes external regret in terms of easy-to-optimize ""proxy
constraints"", while the second player enforces the original constraints by
minimizing swap regret.
  For this new formulation, as for the Lagrangian in the non-convex setting,
the result is a stochastic classifier. For both the proxy-Lagrangian and
Lagrangian formulations, however, we prove that this classifier, instead of
having unbounded size, can be taken to be a distribution over no more than m+1
models (where m is the number of constraints). This is a significant
improvement in practical terms.

Moreover, the problem is even harder when outliers have strong structure.
Departing from problem-tailored heuristics for robust estimation of parametric

objects via sharing attributes. The generalization performance of ZSL is
governed by the attributes, which transfer semantic information from seen
classes to unseen classes. To take full advantage of the knowledge transferred
by attributes, in this paper, we introduce the notion of complementary
attributes (CA), as a supplement to the original attributes, to enhance the
semantic representation ability. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that
complementary attributes can improve the PAC-style generalization bound of
original ZSL model. Since the proposed CA focuses on enhancing the semantic
representation, CA can be easily applied to any existing attribute-based ZSL
methods, including the label-embedding strategy based ZSL (LEZSL) and the
probability-prediction strategy based ZSL (PPZSL). In PPZSL, there is a strong
assumption that all the attributes are independent of each other, which is
arguably unrealistic in practice. To solve this problem, a novel rank
aggregation framework is proposed to circumvent the assumption. Extensive
experiments on five ZSL benchmark datasets and the large-scale ImageNet dataset

significantly and robustly improve existing ZSL methods and achieve the

computations are made up of multi-dimensional dot products between weight and
input vectors. This paper studies how weight repetition ---when the same weight
occurs multiple times in or across weight vectors--- can be exploited to save
energy and improve performance during CNN inference. This generalizes a popular
line of work to improve efficiency from CNN weight sparsity, as reducing
computation due to repeated zero weights is a special case of reducing
computation due to repeated weights.
  To exploit weight repetition, this paper proposes a new CNN accelerator
called the Unique Weight CNN Accelerator (UCNN). UCNN uses weight repetition to
reuse CNN sub-computations (e.g., dot products) and to reduce CNN model size
when stored in off-chip DRAM ---both of which save energy. UCNN further
improves performance by exploiting sparsity in weights. We evaluate UCNN with
an accelerator-level cycle and energy model and with an RTL implementation of
the UCNN processing element. On three contemporary CNNs, UCNN improves
throughput-normalized energy consumption by 1.2x - 4x, relative to a similarly
provisioned baseline accelerator that uses Eyeriss-style sparsity
optimizations. At the same time, the UCNN processing element adds only 17-24%
area overhead relative to the same baseline.

of NRSfM, our method exploits the property of shape recurrency (i.e., many
deforming shapes tend to repeat themselves in time). We show that recurrency is
in fact a generalized rigidity. Based on this, we reduce NRSfM problems to
rigid ones provided that certain recurrency condition is satisfied. Given such
a reduction, standard rigid-SfM techniques are directly applicable (without any
change) to the reconstruction of non-rigid dynamic shapes. To implement this

groups is proposed. The emphasize is on the $B_p$--models. The cases of $B_1$
and its infinite graded-symmetric product $sym\,(\times B_1)^\infty$ correspond
to the usual higher-spin theory and its multi-particle extension, respectively.
The multi-particle $B_2$--higher-spin theory is conjectured to be associated
with String Theory. $B_p$--higher-spin models with $p>2$ are anticipated to be
dual to the rank-$p$ boundary tensor sigma-models. $B_p$ higher-spin models
with $p\geq 2$ possess two coupling constants responsible for higher-spin
interactions in $AdS$ background and stringy/tensor effects, respectively. The
brane-like idempotent extension of the Coxeter higher-spin theory is proposed
allowing to unify in the same model the fields supported by space-times of
different dimensions. Consistency of the holographic interpretation of the
boundary matrix-like model in the $B_2$-higher-spin model is shown to demand
$N\geq 4$ SUSY, suggesting duality with the $N=4$ SYM upon spontaneous breaking
of higher-spin symmetries. The proposed models are shown to admit unitary
truncations.

is typically weakened by the temperature. We here study the effects of
environmental temperature on the non-Markovianity of an open quantum system by
virtue of collision models. The environment is simulated by a chain of
ancillary qubits that are prepared in thermal states with a finite temperature
$T$. Two distinct non-Markovian mechanisms are considered via two types of
collision models, one where the system $S$ consecutively interacts with the
ancillas and a second where $S$ collides only with an intermediate system $S'$
which in turn interacts with the ancillas. We show that in both models the
relation between non-Markovianity and temperature is non-monotonic. In
particular, revivals of non-Markovianity may occur as temperature increases. We
find that the physical reason behind this behavior can be revealed by examining
a peculiar system-environment coherence exchange, leading to ancillary qubit
coherence larger than system coherence which triggers information backflow from
the environment to the system. These results provide insights on the mechanisms
underlying the counterintuitive phenomenon of temperature-enhanced quantum
memory effects.

lifting their legs during gait cycles over uneven terrain. The robot Laika is
under development as a quadruped with a flexible, actuated spine designed to
assist with foot movement and balance during these gaits. This paper presents
the first set of hardware designs for the spine of Laika, a physical prototype
of those designs, and tests in both hardware and simulations that show the
prototype's capabilities. Laika's spine is a tensegrity structure, used for its
advantages with weight and force distribution, and represents the first working
prototype of a tensegrity spine for a quadruped robot. The spine bends by
adjusting the lengths of the cables that separate its vertebrae, and twists
using an actuated rotating vertebra at its center. The current prototype of
Laika has stiff legs attached to the spine, and is used as a test setup for
evaluation of the spine itself. This work shows the advantages of Laika's spine
by demonstrating the spine lifting each of the robot's four feet, both as a
form of balancing and as a precursor for a walking gait. These foot motions,
using specific combinations of bending and rotation movements of the spine, are
measured in both simulation and hardware experiments. Hardware data are used to
calibrate the simulations, such that the simulations can be used for control of
balancing or gait cycles in the future. Future work will attach actuated legs

on the p-wave contacts, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the momentum
distribution in large momentum region in a one-component Fermi gas with a
tunable p-wave interaction. Including p-wave pairing fluctuations within a
strong-coupling theory, we calculate the p-wave contacts above the superfluid
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ from the adiabatic energy relations. We show
that while the p-wave contacts related to the scattering volume monotonically
increases with increasing the interaction strength, one related to the
effective range non-monotonically depends on interaction strength and its sign
changes in the intermediate-coupling regime. The non-monotonic interaction
dependence of these quantities is shown to originate from the competition
between the increase of the cutoff momentum and the decrease of the coupling
constant of the p-wave interaction with increasing the effective range. We also
analyze the asymptotic form of the momentum distribution in large momentum
region. In contrast to the conventional s-wave case, we show that the
asymptotic behavior cannot be completely described by only the p-wave contacts,
and the extra terms, which is not related to the thermodynamic properties,
appear. Furthermore, in high temperature region, we find that the extra terms
dominate the sub-leading term of the large-momentum distribution. We also
directly compare our results with the recent experimental measurement, by
including the effects of a harmonic trap potential within the local density
approximation. We show that our model explains the dependence on the
interaction strength of the p-wave contacts.

use with propositional and first-order logic in modern theorem provers. In
these cases, resolution proof production is a key feature of such tools;
however, the proofs that they produce are not necessarily as concise as
possible. For propositional resolution proofs, there are a wide variety of
proof compression techniques. There are fewer techniques for compressing
first-order resolution proofs generated by automated theorem provers. This
paper describes an approach to compressing first-order logic proofs based on
lifting proof compression ideas used in propositional logic to first-order
logic. One method for propositional proof compression is partial
regularization, which removes an inference $\eta$ when it is redundant in the
sense that its pivot literal already occurs as the pivot of another inference
in every path from $\eta$ to the root of the proof. This paper describes the
generalization of the partial-regularization algorithm
RecyclePivotsWithIntersection [10] from propositional logic to first-order
logic. The generalized algorithm performs partial regularization of resolution
proofs containing resolution and factoring inferences with unification. An
empirical evaluation of the generalized algorithm and its combinations with the

solvers, making the SCvx algorithm well suited for real-time applications.
Analysis is presented to show that the algorithm converges both globally and
superlinearly, guaranteeing i) local optimality recovery: if the converged
solution is feasible with respect to the original problem, then it is also a
local optimum; ii) strong convergence: if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL)
inequality holds at the converged solution, then the solution is unique. The
superlinear rate of convergence is obtained by exploiting the structure of
optimal control problems, showcasing that faster rate of convergence can be
achieved by leveraging specific problem properties when compared to generic
nonlinear programming methods. Numerical simulations are performed for a
non-convex quad-rotor motion planning problem, and corresponding results
obtained using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and general purpose
Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers are provided for comparison. The results
show that the convergence rate of the SCvx algorithm is indeed superlinear, and
that SCvx outperforms the other two methods by converging in less number of
iterations.

maximizing the information centrality $I_v$ of a given node $v$ in a network
with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, by creating $k$ new edges incident to $v$. Since
$I_v$ is the reciprocal of the sum of resistance distance $\mathcal{R}_v$
between $v$ and all nodes, we alternatively consider the problem of minimizing
$\mathcal{R}_v$ by adding $k$ new edges linked to $v$. We show that the
objective function is monotone and supermodular. We provide a simple greedy
algorithm with an approximation factor $\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)$ and
$O(n^3)$ running time. To speed up the computation, we also present an

We here investigate this phenomenon by taking into account the effects beyond
the mean-field approximation. To this end, we employ the microscopic
particle-rotor model based on the covariant density functional theory. We show
that the deformation of $^{30}$Si does not completely disappear, even though it
is somewhat reduced, after a $\Lambda$ particle is added if the
beyond-mean-field effect is taken into account. We also discuss the impurity
effect of $\Lambda$ particle on the electric quadrupole transition, and show
that an addition of a $\Lambda$ particle leads to a reduction in the $B(E2)$
value, as a consequence of the reduction in the deformation parameter.

KONUS instrument onboard WIND spacecraft, and Anti-Coincidence System (ACS)
onboard the INTERGRAL space observatory, we investigate spatio-temporal
dynamics of photospheric emission sources, identify sources of helioseismic
waves and compare the flare photospheric dynamics with the hard X-ray (HXR)
temporal profiles. The results show that the photospheric flare impacts started
to develop in compact regions in close vicinity of the magnetic polarity
inversion line (PIL) in the pre-impulsive phase before detection of the HXR
emission. The initial photospheric disturbances were localized in the region of
strong horizontal magnetic field of the PIL, and, thus, are likely associated
with a compact sheared magnetic structure elongated along the PIL. The acoustic
egression power maps revealed two primary sources of generation of sunquakes,
which were associated with places of the strongest photospheric impacts in the
pre-impulsive phase and the early impulsive phase. This can explain the two
types of helioseismic waves observed in this flare. Analysis of the
high-cadence HMI filtergrams suggests that the flare energy release developed
in the form of sequential involvement of compact low-lying magnetic loops that

  State-of-the-art decentralized algorithms use communications between either
all pairs of adjacent agents or a random subset of them at each iteration.
Another class of algorithms uses a random walk incremental strategy, which
sequentially activates a succession of nodes; these incremental algorithms
require diminishing step sizes to converge to the solution, so their
convergence is relatively slow.
  In this work, we propose a random walk algorithm that uses a fixed step size
and converges faster than the existing random walk incremental algorithms. Our
algorithm is also communication efficient. Each iteration uses only one link to
communicate the latest information for an agent to another. Since this
communication rule mimics a man walking around the network, we call our new
algorithm Walkman. We establish convergence for convex and nonconvex
objectives. For decentralized least squares, we derive a linear rate of
convergence and obtain a better communication complexity than those of other
decentralized algorithms. Numerical experiments verify our analysis results.

Harrington and Collins [2] modeled another way of breaking the symmetry and
producing net polarization - the distortion of a rapidly rotating hot star.

from +42 parts-per-million (ppm) at a wavelength of 741 nm to -22 ppm at 395

Currently galactic exploration is being revolutionized by a flow of
new data: Gaia provides measurements of stellar distances and kinematics;
growing numbers of spectroscopic surveys provide values of stellar atmospheric
parameters and abundances of elements; and Kepler and K2 missions provide
asteroseismic information for an increasing number of stars. Aims. In this work
we aim to determine stellar distances and ages using Gaia and
spectrophotometric data in a consistent way. We estimate precisions of age and
distance determinations with Gaia end-of-mission and TGAS parallax precisions.
Methods. To this end we incorporated parallax and extinction data into the
isochrone fitting method used in the Unified tool to estimate Distances, Ages,
and Masses (UniDAM). We prepared datasets that allowed us to study the
improvement of distance and age estimates with the inclusion of TGAS and Gaia
end-of-mission parallax precisions in isochrone fitting. Results. Using TGAS
parallaxes in isochrone fitting we are able to reduce distance and age estimate
uncertainties for TGAS stars for distances up to 1 kpc by more than one third,
compared to results based only on spectrophotometric data. With Gaia
end-of-mission parallaxes in isochrone fitting we will be able to further
decrease our distance uncertainties by about a factor of 20 and age
uncertainties by a factor of two for stars up to 10 kpc away from the Sun.
Conclusions. We demonstrate that we will be able to improve our distance
estimates for about one third of stars in spectroscopic surveys and to decrease
log(age) uncertainties by about a factor of two for over 80% of stars as
compared to the uncertainties obtained without parallax priors using Gaia
end-of-mission parallaxes consistently with spectrophotometry in isochrone
fitting .

pre-selection of candidate style patches. Projective features are then encoded

carried out under the framework of partially shared latent factor (PSLF)
learning, a multi-view feature learning scheme. PSLF achieves effective
multi-view feature fusion by distilling and exploiting consistent and
complementary feature information from multiple views, while also selecting
style patches from the candidates. Our style analysis approach supports both
unsupervised and semi-supervised analysis. For the latter, our method accepts
both user-specified shape labels and style-ranked triplets as clustering

localization as well as improvements over state-of-the-art methods. We also
present several applications enabled by our style analysis.

substantial computational resources are necessary to compensate for incomplete

higher the exit rate for low population size. For simple social systems, it is
likely that the individual representations are not redundant and large group
sizes ensure that this non--redundant information is actually available to a
substantial number of individuals. For complex social systems information
redundancy makes information evaluation and transfer inefficient and, as such,
group size becomes a drawback rather than a benefit. The effect of group sizes
on outgoing fluxes, evacuation times and wall effects are carefully studied
with a Monte Carlo framework accounting also for the presence of an internal
obstacle.

and vertical line segments in the plane. A $k$-bend path is a path made up of
at most $k + 1$ line segments. A $B_k$-VPG representation of a graph is a
collection of $k$-bend paths such that each path in the collection represents a
vertex of the graph and two such paths intersect if and only if the vertices
they represent are adjacent in the graph. The graphs that have a $B_k$-VPG
representation are called $B_k$-VPG graphs. It is known that the poset
dimension $dim(G)$ of a cocomparability graph $G$ is greater than or equal to
its bend number $bend(G)$. Cohen et al. ({\textsc{order 2015}}) asked for
examples of cocomparability graphs with low bend number and high poset
dimension. We answer this question by proving that for each $m, t \in
\mathbb{N}$, there exists a cocomparability graph $G_{t,m}$ with $t <
bend(G_{t,m}) \leq 4t+29$ and $dim(G_{t,m})-bend(G_{t,m})>m$. Techniques used
to prove the above result, allows us to partially address the open question
posed by Chaplick et al. ({\textsc{wg 2012}}) who asked whether
$B_k$-VPG-chordal $\subsetneq$ $B_{k+1}$-VPG-chordal for all $k \in
\mathbb{N}$. We address this by proving that there are infinitely many $m \in
\mathbb{N}$ such that $B_m$-VPG-split $\subsetneq$ $B_{m+1}$-VPG-split which
provides infinitely many positive examples. We use the same techniques to prove
that, for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $B_t$-VPG-$Forb(C_{\geq 5})$ $\subsetneq$
$B_{4t+29}$-VPG-$Forb(C_{\geq 5})$, where $Forb(C_{\geq 5})$ denotes the family
of graphs that does not contain induced cycles of length greater than 4.
Furthermore, we show that for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $PB_t$-VPG-split
$\subsetneq PB_{36t+80}$-VPG-split, where $PB_t$-VPG denotes the class of
graphs with proper bend number at most $t$.

situations where the electric current induced by an external bias voltage
competes with the electric current excited by the temperature difference of the

of Majorana fermions in strongly nonequilibrium quantum dots via noise of the
thermoelectric transport beyond linear response. It is demonstrated that
whereas mean thermoelectric quantities are only universal at large bias
voltages, the noise of the electric current excited by an external bias voltage

from some $\mu$ a second local minimum will show up. As $\mu$ increases

equation beyond chiral limit. Employing a Gaussian gluon model and rainbow
truncation, we find that the quasi-Wigner solution exists in a limited region
of current quark mass, $m<43.1$ MeV, at zero temperature $T$ and zero chemical
potential $\mu$. The difference between Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT)
effective actions of quasi-Wigner and Nambu-Goldstone solutions shows that the
Nambu-Goldstone solution is chosen by physics. Moreover, the quasi-Wigner
solution is studied at finite temperature and chemical potential, the far
infrared mass function of quasi-Wigner solution is negative and decrease along
with $T$ at $\mu=0$. Its susceptibility is divergent at certain temperature
with small $m$, and this temperature decreases along with $m$. Taking $T=80$
MeV as an example, the quasi-Wigner solution is shown at finite chemical
potential upto $\mu=350$ MeV as well as Nambu solution, the coexistence of
these two solutions indicates that the QCD system suffers the first order phase
transition. The first order chiral phase transition line is determined by the
difference of CJT effective actions.

with GW170817 opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of double neutron
star (NS) mergers. We argue that the standard interpretation of AT2017gfo as
being powered by radioactive decays of r-process elements faces the challenge
of simultaneously accounting for the peak luminosity and peak time of the
event, as it is not easy to achieve the required high mass, and especially the
low opacity of the ejecta required to fit the data. A plausible solution would
be to invoke an additional energy source, which is probably provided by the
merger product. We consider energy injection from two types of the merger
products: (1) a post-merger black hole powered by fallback accretion; and (2) a
long-lived NS remnant. The former case can only account for the early emission
of AT2017gfo, with the late emission still powered by radioactive decay. In the
latter case, both early- and late-emission components can be well interpreted
as due to energy injection from a spinning-down NS, with the required mass and
opacity of the ejecta components well consistent with known numerical
simulation results. We suggest that there is a strong indication that the
merger product of GW170817 is a long-lived (supramassive or even permanently
stable), low magnetic field NS. The result provides a stringent constraint on
the equations of state of NSs.

several original papers, which demonstrates suppression of the collapse caused
by this potential, and the creation of the otherwise missing ground state in a
3D gas of bosonic dipoles pulled by the same potential to the central charge,
with repulsive contact interactions between them, represented by the cubic term
in the respective Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). In two dimensions (2D),
quintic self-repulsion is necessary for the suppression of the collapse;
alternatively, this may be provided by the effective quartic repulsion,
produced by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the GPE. 3D states carrying
angular momentum are constructed in the model with the symmetry reduced from
spherical to cylindrical by an external polarizing field. Interplay of the
collapse suppression and miscibility-immiscibility transition is considered in
a binary condensate. The consideration of the 3D setting in the form of the
many-body quantum system, with the help of the Monte Carlo method, demonstrates
that, although the quantum collapse cannot be fully suppressed, the
self-trapped states, predicted by the GPE, exist in the many-body setting as
metastable modes protected against the collapse by a tall potential barrier.

study of edge states in the quantum Hall effect, including the prediction of
multiple counter-propagating modes in the fractional quantum Hall regime, the
prediction of edge mode renormalization due to disorder, and studies of how the
sample confining potential affects the edge state structure (edge
reconstruction), among others. In this paper, we study edge transport for the
$\nu_{\text{bulk}}=2/3$ edge in the disordered, fully incoherent transport
regime. To do so, we use a hydrodynamic approximation for the calculation of
voltage and temperature profiles along the edge of the sample. Within this
formalism, we study two different bare mode structures with tunneling: the
original edge structure predicted by Wen [2] and MacDonald [3], and the more
complicated edge structure proposed by Meir [4], whose renormalization and
transport characteristics were discussed by Wang, Meir and Gefen (WMG) [5]. We
find that in the fully incoherent regime, the topological characteristics of
transport (quantized electrical and heat conductance) are intact, with finite
size corrections which are determined by the extent of equilibration. In
particular, our calculation of conductance for the WMG model in a double QPC
geometry reproduce conductance results of a recent experiment by R. Sabo, et
al. [17], which are inconsistent with the model of MacDonald. Our results can
be explained in the charge/neutral mode picture, with incoherent analogues of

scheduling algorithm on multicast precoding, which is typically assumed random.
In this paper, we focus on this aspect by showing that, although the overall
system performance is improved, a random scheduler does not properly tackle
specific scenarios in which the precoding algorithm can poorly perform. Based
on these considerations, we design a Geographical Scheduling Algorithm (GSA)
aimed at improving the precoding performance in these critical scenarios and,
consequently, the performance at system level as well. Through extensive
numerical simulations, we show that the proposed GSA provides a significant
performance improvement with respect to the legacy random scheduling.

walls are studied in cylindrical nanowires consisting of alternating segments

sites, are utilized in combination with current pulses, to control the position

Magnetic force microscopy results further confirm the occurrence of current
assisted domain wall depinning. Data bits are therefore shifted along the
nanowire by sequentially pinning and depinning a domain wall between successive
interfaces, a requirement necessary for race-track type memory devices. We
demonstrate that the direction, amplitude and duration of the applied current
pulses determine the propagation of the domain wall across pinning sites. These
results demonstrate a multi-bit cylindrical nanowire device, utilizing current
assisted data manipulation. The prospect of sequential pinning and depinning in
these nanowires allows the bit density to increase by several Tbs, depending on

algebraically closed field $K$. Denote by $A=X(K)$ the set of $K$-points of
$X$. We study a class of endomorphisms of pro-algebraic groups, namely
algebraic group cellular automata over $(G,X,K)$. They are cellular automata
$\tau \colon A^G \to A^G$ whose local defining map is induced by a homomorphism
of algebraic groups $X^M \to X$ where $M\subset G$ is a finite memory set of
$\tau$. Our first result is that when $G$ is sofic, such an algebraic group
cellular automaton $\tau$ is invertible whenever it is injective and
$\text{char}(K)=0$. As an application, we prove that if $G$ is sofic and the
group $X$ is commutative then the group ring $R[G]$, where $R=\text{End}(X)$ is
the endomorphism ring of $X$, is stably finite. When $G$ is amenable, we show
that an algebraic group cellular automaton $\tau$ is surjective if and only if
it satisfies a weak form of pre-injectivity called $(\bullet)$-pre-injectivity.
This yields an analogue of the classical Moore-Myhill Garden of Eden theorem.
We also introduce the near ring $R(K,G)$ which is $K[X_g: g \in G]$ as an
additive group but the multiplication is induced by the group law of $G$. The
near ring $R(K,G)$ contains naturally the group ring $K[G]$ and we extend
Kaplansky's conjectures to this new setting. Among other results, we prove that
when $G$ is an orderable group, then all one-sided invertible elements of
$R(K,G)$ are trivial, i.e., of the form $aX_g+b$ for some $g\in G$, $a\in K^*$,
$b\in K$. This allows us to show that when $G$ is locally residually finite and
orderable (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}^d$ or a free group), and $\text{char}(K)=0$, all
injective algebraic cellular automata $\tau \colon \mathbb{C}^G \to
\mathbb{C}^G$ are of the form $\tau(x)(h)= a x(g^{-1}h) +b$ for all $x\in

stellar mass $J_{\rm *}=3.4M_{\rm *}^{\rm1.26\pm0.06}$, in very good agreement
with the prediction based on the empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation in the
same mass range, and show a strong correlation between maximum `observed'
rotation velocity and dark matter halo circular velocity $v_{\rm c}=6.4v_{\rm
max}^{0.64\pm0.04}$. Tracing back in time these structures' progenitors, we
find all to lose a fraction $1-f_j$ of their maximum angular momentum. Thin
discs are significantly better at retaining their high-redshift spins
($f_j\sim0.70$) than thick ones ($f_j\sim0.40$). Stellar haloes have their
progenitor baryons assembled the latest ($z_{\rm~1/2}\sim1.1$) and over the
longest timescales ($\tau\sim6.2$~Gyr), and have the smallest fraction of stars
born in-situ ($f_{\rm in-situ}=0.35\pm0.14$). All other structures have
$1.5\lesssim z_{\rm1/2}\lesssim3$, $\tau=4\pm2$~Gyr and $f_{\rm
in-situ}\gtrsim0.9$.

demand for their formal verification, not only due to stronger certification

However, the complex nature of such systems, for example, the intricate

verification is often infeasible. This motivates the need for novel analysis
approaches that modularise the problem, allowing us to restrict our analysis to
one particular aspect of the system while abstracting away from others. For
instance, while verifying the real-time properties of an autonomous system we
might hide the details of the internal decision-making components. In this
paper we describe verification of a range of properties across distinct
dimesnions on a practical hybrid agent architecture. This allows us to verify
the autonomous decision-making, real-time aspects, and spatial aspects of an
autonomous vehicle platooning system. This modular approach also illustrates
how both algorithmic and deductive verification techniques can be applied for

error correction still being out of reach with present-day technology, a
non-vanishing error rate is inevitable. We study the influence of gate errors
on simulations of the Trotterized time evolution of the quantum system with
focus on the fermionic Hubbard model. Specifically, we consider the effect of
stochastic over-rotations in the applied gates. Depending on the particular
algorithm implemented such gate errors may lead to a time evolution that
corresponds to a disordered fermionic system, or they may correspond to
unphysical errors, e.g., violate particle number conservation. We substantiate
our analysis by numerical simulations of model systems. In addition we
establish the relation between the gate fidelity and the strength of the
over-rotations in a Trotterized quantum simulation. Based on this we provide
estimates for the maximum number of Trotter steps which can be performed with
sufficient accuracy for a given algorithm. This in turn implies, apart from
obvious limitations on the maximum time of the simulation, also limits on the
system size which can be handled.

to accurately predict the occurrence and efficiency of mixing processes beyond
convective boundaries, one can use the luminosity of the bump --- a diagnostic
of the maximum extension of the convective envelope during the first-dredge up
--- as a calibrator for such processes. By combining asteroseismic and
spectroscopic constraints, we expand the analysis of the bump to masses and
metallicities beyond those previously accessible using globular clusters. Our
dataset comprises nearly 3000 red-giant stars observed by {\it Kepler} and with
APOGEE spectra. Using statistical mixture models, we are able to detect the
bump in the average seismic parameters $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\langle \Delta \nu
\rangle$, and show that its observed position reveals general trends with mass
and metallicity in line with expectations from models. Moreover, our analysis
indicates that standard stellar models underestimate the depth of efficiently
mixed envelopes. The inclusion of significant overshooting from the base of the
convective envelope, with an efficiency that increases with decreasing
metallicity, allows to reproduce the observed location of the bump.
Interestingly, this trend was also reported in previous studies of globular
clusters.

metabolic flux analysis that models the reactions of the whole genome-scale
cellular system in probabilistic terms, and can infer the full flux vector
distribution of genome-scale metabolic systems based on exchange and
intracellular (e.g. 13C) flux measurements, steady-state assumptions, and

together in a simple truncated multivariate posterior distribution, which
reveals informative flux couplings. Our model is a plug-in replacement to
conventional metabolic balance methods, such as flux balance analysis (FBA).

crucial problems for robotics and network analysis. Therefore, it received a
lot of attention in the last decades and was analyzed in many different
settings. The graph exploration problem is a theoretical and abstract model,
where an algorithm has to decide how the agent, also called explorer, moves
through a network such that every point of interest is visited at least once.
For its decisions, the knowledge of the algorithm is limited by the perception
of the explorer.
  There are different models regarding the perception of the explorer. We look
at the fixed graph scenario proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs (Proc. of
ICALP, 1993), where the explorer starts at a vertex of the network and sees all
reachable vertices, their unique names and their distance from the current
position. Therefore, the algorithm recognizes already seen vertices and can
adapt its strategy during exploring, because it does not forget anything.
  Because the algorithm only learns the structure of the graph during
computation, it cannot deterministically compute an optimal tour that visits
every vertex at least once without prior knowledge. Therefore, we are
interested in the amount of crucial a-priori information needed to solve the
problem optimally, which we measure in terms of the well-studied model of
advice complexity. [..]
  We look at different variations of the graph exploration problem and
distinguish between directed or undirected edges, cyclic or non-cyclic
solutions, unit costs or individual costs for the edges and different amounts
of a-priori structural knowledge of the explorer. [..] In this work, we present
algorithms with an advice complexity of $\mathcal{O}(m+n)$, thus improving the
classical bound for sparse graphs.

ablating neurons in networks trained on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our

However, looking at individual layers separately, both mutual information and
class selectivity are positively correlated with classification performance, at
least for networks with ReLU activation functions. We provide explanations for
this phenomenon and conclude that it is ill-advised to compare the proposed
information-theoretic quantities across layers. Furthermore, we show that
cumulative ablation of neurons with ascending or descending

the joint behavior of multiple neurons, such as redundancy and synergy, with
comparably low computational cost. We also draw connections to the information

Here we investigate contact interactions that generalize the delta function
potential and corresponding generalizations of the Kronig-Penney model within
conventional and parity-time symmetric quantum mechanics (PTQM). In
conventional quantum mechanics we determine the most general contact
interaction compatible with self-adjointness; in PTQM we consider interactions
that are symmetric under the combined transformation PT. In both cases we find
that the most general interaction has four independent real parameters;
depending on the parameter values the interaction can support more bound states
than the conventional delta function. In the PT case the two bound state
energies can be both real or a complex conjugate pair, with the transition
corresponding to the breaking of PT-symmetry. The scattering states for the PT
case are also found to exhibit spontaneous breaking of PT-symmetry. We
investigate the energy bands when the generalized contact interactions are
repeated periodically in space in one dimension. In the Hermitian case we find
that the two bound states result in two narrow bands generically separated by a
gap. These bands intersect at a single point in the Brillouin zone as the
interaction parameters are varied. Near the intersection the bands form a
massless Dirac cone. In the PT-symmetric case, as the parameters of the contact
interaction are varied the two bound state bands undergo a PT-symmetry breaking
transition wherein the two band energies go from being real to being a complex
conjugate pair. The PT-symmetric Kronig-Penney model provides a simple soluble
example of the transition which has the same form as in other models of

centrosymmetric $AB$I$_3$ perovskite iodides (where $A$ = Cs, Rb, K and $B$ =

three types of $A$- and $B$-site cation ordering schemes and three different

that 15 produce polar space groups and display spontaneous electric
polarizations ranging from 0.26 to 23.33 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Furthermore, we find
that a layered $A$-site/rock salt $B$-site ordering, in the presence of an
$a^0a^0c^+$ rotation pattern, produces a chiral ""vortex-like"" $A$-site
displacement pattern. We then investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on one
of these systems, (CsRb)(SnGe)I$_6$, in layered and rock salt ordered
configurations. In both phases, we find strong competition between the cation
ordering schemes as well as an enhancement of the spontaneous polarization
magnitude under tensile strain. Finally, using advanced functionals, we

nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming. This work is
motivated by an application in statistics to the problem of multidimensional

metric manifolds, with two guiding ideas in mind: first, what geometric objects
are best suited for capturing the key properties of almost 3-contact metric
manifolds, and second, the newly defined classes should admit 'good' metric
connections with skew torsion. In particular, we introduce the Reeb commutator
function and the Reeb Killing function, we define the new classes of canonical
almost 3-contact metric manifolds and of 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds
(including as special cases 3-Sasaki manifolds, quaternionic Heisenberg groups,
and many others) and prove that the latter are hypernormal, thus generalizing a
seminal result by Kashiwada. We study their behaviour under a new class of
deformations, called $\mathcal{H}$-homothetic deformations, and prove that they
admit an underlying quaternionic contact structure, from which we deduce the
Ricci curvature. For example, a 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifold is Einstein
either if $\alpha=\delta$ (the 3-$\alpha$-Sasaki case) or if
$\delta=(2n+3)\alpha$, where $\dim M=4n+3$.
  The second part is actually devoted to finding these adapted connections. We
start with a very general notion of $\varphi$-compatible connections, where
$\varphi$ denotes any element of the associated sphere of almost contact
structures, and make them unique by a certain extra condition, thus yielding
the notion of canonical connection (they exist exactly on canonical manifolds,
hence the name). For 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, we compute the
torsion of this connection explicitly and we prove that it is parallel, we
describe the holonomy, the $\nabla$-Ricci curvature, and we show that the
metric cone is a HKT-manifold. In dimension 7, we construct a cocalibrated
$G_2$-structure inducing the canonical connection and we prove the existence of
four generalized Killing spinors.

collision avoidance and traffic jam detection. However, broadcast authenticity
is not sufficient to guarantee message correctness. The goal of misbehavior
detection is to analyze application data and knowledge about physical processes
in these cyber-physical systems to detect incorrect messages, enabling local
revocation of vehicles transmitting malicious messages. Comparative studies
between detection mechanisms are rare due to the lack of a reference dataset.
We take the first steps to address this challenge by introducing the Vehicular
Reference Misbehavior Dataset (VeReMi) and a discussion of valid metrics for
such an assessment. VeReMi is the first public extensible dataset, allowing
anyone to reproduce the generation process, as well as contribute attacks and
use the data to compare new detection mechanisms against existing ones. The
result of our analysis shows that the acceptance range threshold and the simple
speed check are complementary mechanisms that detect different attacks. This
supports the intuitive notion that fusion can lead to better results with data,
and we suggest that future work should focus on effective fusion with VeReMi as
an evaluation baseline.

$W^{2,p}$ in space. This improves known results in the literature to a large
extend. For instance, in [21, Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 3] it is proved that
the Laplace and the Stokes operator in the underlying setting have maximal
regularity. In that result the range of p admitting $W^{2,p}$ regularity,
however, is restricted to the interval $1<p<1+\delta$ for small $\delta>0$,
depending on the opening angle of the wedge. This note gives a detailed answer
to the question, whether the optimal Sobolev regularity extends to the full
range $1<p<\infty$. We will show that for the Laplacian this does only hold on
a suitable subspace, but, depending on the opening angle of the wedge domain,
not for every $p\in(1,\infty)$ on the entire $L^p$-space. On the other hand,
for the Stokes operator in the space of solenoidal fields $L^p_{\sigma}$ we
obtain optimal Sobolev regularity for the full range $1<p<\infty$ and for all
opening angles less that $\pi$. Roughly speaking, this relies on the fact that
an existing $ bad$ part of $L^p$ for the Laplacian is complementary to the
space of solenoidal vector fields.

numerical simulation to study the phase transition dynamics in the context of

This device is made of nematic liquid crystals confined in a shallow square
well, and is described by the planar Lebwohl-Lasher model. The stochastic phase
transition processes of the system in the presence of a weak oscillating
potential is simulated using an over-damped Langevin dynamics. Our simulation
results reveal that, depending on system size, the phase transition may follow
two distinct pathways: in small systems the pre-existing defect structures at
the corners hold until the last stage and there is no newly formed defect point
in the bulk during the phase transition, In large systems new defect points
appear spontaneously in the bulk and eventually merge with the pre-existing
defects at the corners. For both transition pathways stochastic resonance can
be observed, but show dramatic difference in their responses to the boundary
anchoring strength. In small systems we observe a ""sticky-boundary"" effect for
a certain range of anchoring strength in which the phase transition gets stuck
and stochastic resonance becomes de-activated. Our work demonstrates the
dynamical interplay among defects, noises, and boundary conditions in confined
liquid crystals.

obtain effective temperatures and metallicities for both stars. A Bayesian
framework is used to explore a grid of stellar evolution models, where both
helium abundance and mixing length are free to vary, and use observed
parameters (mass, density, temperature and metallicity) for each star to obtain
the age and constrain the helium abundance of the system. The masses and radii

order formalism which treats the graviton and its dual on the same footing at
the level of the action. This generalizes previous work by other authors in two
directions: 1) we work in arbitrary space-time dimension, and 2) the gravitino
field and supersymmetry are also considered. This requires the construction of
conformally invariant curvatures (the Cotton fields) for a family of mixed
symmetry tensors and tensor-spinors, whose properties we prove (invariance;
completeness; conformal Poincar\'e lemma). We use these geometric tools to
solve the Hamiltonian constraints appearing in the first order formalism of the
graviton and gravitino: the constraints are solved through the introduction of
prepotentials enjoying (linearized) conformal invariance. These new variables
(two tensor fields for the graviton, one tensor-spinor for the gravitino) are
injected into the action and equations of motion, which take a geometrically
simple form in terms of the Cotton tensor(-spinors) of the prepotentials. In
particular, the equations of motion of the graviton are equivalent to twisted

advent of more and more online social media, the information available and its
utilization have come under the threat of several anomalies. Anomalies are the
major cause of online frauds which allow information access by unauthorized
users as well as information forging. One of the anomalies that act as a silent
attacker is the horizontal anomaly. These are the anomalies caused by a user
because of his/her variable behaviour towards different sources. Horizontal
anomalies are difficult to detect and hazardous for any network. In this paper,
a self-healing neuro-fuzzy approach (NHAD) is used for the detection, recovery,
and removal of horizontal anomalies efficiently and accurately. The proposed
approach operates over the five paradigms, namely, missing links, reputation
gain, significant difference, trust properties, and trust score. The proposed
approach is evaluated with three datasets: DARPA'98 benchmark dataset,
synthetic dataset, and real-time traffic. Results show that the accuracy of the
proposed NHAD model for 10% to 30% anomalies in synthetic dataset ranges
between 98.08% and 99.88%. The evaluation over DARPA'98 dataset demonstrates
that the proposed approach is better than the existing solutions as it provides
99.97% detection rate for anomalous class. For real-time traffic, the proposed
NHAD model operates with an average accuracy of 99.42% at 99.90% detection
rate.

with state-of-the-art performance across numerous applications. The main
premise of ResNets is that they allow the training of each layer to focus on
fitting just the residual of the previous layer's output and the target output.
Thus, we should expect that the trained network is no worse than what we can
obtain if we remove the residual layers and train a shallower network instead.
However, due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, it is not at all
clear that ResNets indeed achieve this behavior, rather than getting stuck at
some arbitrarily poor local minimum. In this paper, we rigorously prove that
arbitrarily deep, nonlinear residual units indeed exhibit this behavior, in the
sense that the optimization landscape contains no local minima with value above
what can be obtained with a linear predictor (namely a 1-layer network).
Notably, we show this under minimal or no assumptions on the precise network
architecture, data distribution, or loss function used. We also provide a
quantitative analysis of approximate stationary points for this problem.
Finally, we show that with a certain tweak to the architecture, training the
network with standard stochastic gradient descent achieves an objective value

probabilistic inference framework. However, standard probabilistic inference
algorithms work at a propositional level, and thus cannot capture the
symmetries and redundancies that are present in these tasks. Algorithms that
exploit those symmetries have been devised in different research fields, for
example by the lifted inference-, multiple object tracking-, and modeling and
simulation-communities. The common idea, that we call state space abstraction,
is to perform inference over compact representations of sets of symmetric
states. Although they are concerned with a similar topic, the relationship
between these approaches has not been investigated systematically. This survey
provides the following contributions. We perform a systematic literature review
to outline the state of the art in probabilistic inference methods exploiting
symmetries. From an initial set of more than 4,000 papers, we identify 116
relevant papers. Furthermore, we provide new high-level categories that
classify the approaches, based on common properties of the approaches. The
research areas underlying each of the categories are introduced concisely.
Researchers from different fields that are confronted with a state space
explosion problem in a probabilistic system can use this classification to
identify possible solutions. Finally, based on this conceptualization, we
identify potentials for future research, as some relevant application domains
are not addressed by current approaches.

missing countermeasures or because their default configurations ignores such
attacks. The pressure to secure network services against such attacks is
shifting more and more from the service operators to the network operators of
the servers under attack. Recent technologies such as software-defined
networking offer the flexibility and extensibility to analyze and influence
network flows without the assistance of the target operator. Based on our
previous work on a network-based mitigation, we have extended a framework to
detect and mitigate slow-running DDoS attacks within the network
infrastructure, but without requiring access to servers under attack. We
developed and evaluated several identification schemes to identify attackers in
the network solely based on network traffic information. We showed that by
measuring the packet rate and the uniformity of the packet distances, a
reliable identificator can be built, given a training period of the deployment

large body of research has however shown the strong limits of the
de-identification release-and-forget model, where data is anonymized and
shared. This has led to the development of privacy-preserving query-based
systems. Based on the idea of ""sticky noise"", Diffix has been recently proposed
as a novel query-based mechanism satisfying alone the EU Article~29 Working
Party's definition of anonymization. According to its authors, Diffix adds less
noise to answers than solutions based on differential privacy while allowing
for an unlimited number of queries.
  This paper presents a new class of noise-exploitation attacks, exploiting the
noise added by the system to infer private information about individuals in the
dataset. Our first differential attack uses samples extracted from Diffix in a
likelihood ratio test to discriminate between two probability distributions. We
show that using this attack against a synthetic best-case dataset allows us to
infer private information with 89.4% accuracy using only 5 attributes. Our
second cloning attack uses dummy conditions that conditionally strongly affect
the output of the query depending on the value of the private attribute. Using
this attack on four real-world datasets, we show that we can infer private
attributes of at least 93% of the users in the dataset with accuracy between
93.3% and 97.1%, issuing a median of 304 queries per user. We show how to
optimize this attack, targeting 55.4% of the users and achieving 91.7%
accuracy, using a maximum of only 32 queries per user.
  Our attacks demonstrate that adding data-dependent noise, as done by Diffix,
is not sufficient to prevent inference of private attributes. We furthermore
argue that Diffix alone fails to satisfy Art. 29 WP's definition of
anonymization. [...]

that although the fluctuation of traffic (reflected by the variance of total

soft phonon modes associated with [Se$_2$]$^{2-}$ dimers lead to ultra-low
lattice thermal conductivities in Pd$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ monolayers (1.5 and 2.9
Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ along the $a$- and $b$-axes at 300\,K respectively), which
are comparable to those of high-performance bulk thermoelectric materials such

in the regime of large interaction coefficients. We consider the dynamics
described by a mean-field model given by a nonlinear evolution partial
differential equation representing the probability distribution of one given
neuron in a large network. The case of weak connectivity previously studied
displays a unique, exponentially stable, stationary solution. Here, we consider
the case of strong connectivities, and exhibit the presence of possibly
non-unique stationary behaviors or non-stationary behaviors. To this end, using
Hopf-Cole transformation, we demonstrate that the solutions exponentially
concentrate around a singular Dirac measure as the connectivity parameter
diverges, centered at the zeros of a time-dependent continuous function. We
next characterize the points at which this measure concentrates, and exhibit a
particular solution corresponding to a Dirac measure concentrated on a
time-dependent point satisfying an ordinary differential equation identical to
the original FitzHugh-Nagumo system. This solution may thus feature multiple
stable fixed points or periodic orbits, respectively corresponding to a
clumping of the whole system at rest, or a synchronization of cells on a
periodic solution. We illustrate these results with numerical simulations of
neural networks with a relatively modest number of neurons and finite coupling
strength, and show that away from the bifurcations of the limit system, the
asymptotic equation recovers the main properties of more realistic networks.

is a widespread problem that threatens free discussion and has negative
physical and mental health consequences for victims and communities. While
prior work has proposed automated methods to identify hostile comments in
online discussions, these methods work retrospectively on comments that have
already been posted, making it difficult to intervene before an interaction
escalates. In this paper we instead consider the problem of forecasting future
hostilities in online discussions, which we decompose into two tasks: (1) given
an initial sequence of non-hostile comments in a discussion, predict whether
some future comment will contain hostility; and (2) given the first hostile
comment in a discussion, predict whether this will lead to an escalation of
hostility in subsequent comments. Thus, we aim to forecast both the presence
and intensity of hostile comments based on linguistic and social features from
earlier comments. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a corpus of over 30K
annotated Instagram comments from over 1,100 posts. Our approach is able to
predict the appearance of a hostile comment on an Instagram post ten or more
hours in the future with an AUC of .82 (task 1), and can furthermore
distinguish between high and low levels of future hostility with an AUC of .91
(task 2).

This leads to both direct decay of the excited level population to the ground

(infrared fluorescence). It has been shown that the behavior of these two
fluorescence profiles is different: increasing the atomic density, the violet
fluorescence profile exhibits a well-pronounced self-absorption dip, while the
infrared line does not show any narrow-width reduced absorption structure.
Moreover, the profiles of the infrared line have a higher signal-to-noise ratio
than that of the violet line. Our investigations show that beside atomic
population, atomic polarization is also transferred by the cascade transitions.
This is evidenced by registration of coherent magneto-optical resonances at the
two fluorescence lines. The signal-to-noise ratio of these resonances
registered at the first resonance line is significantly higher than at those
obtained at the second resonance line. The proposed study makes it possible to
examine cascade transitions in alkali atoms, particularly the preservation of

contrast to the matrix factorization based cross-domain techniques, our method
is deep transfer learning, which can learn complex user-item interaction
relationships. We assume that hidden layers in two base networks are connected
by cross mappings, leading to the collaborative cross networks (CoNet). CoNet
enables dual knowledge transfer across domains by introducing cross connections
from one base network to another and vice versa. CoNet is achieved in
multi-layer feedforward networks by adding dual connections and joint loss
functions, which can be trained efficiently by back-propagation. The proposed
model is thoroughly evaluated on two large real-world datasets. It outperforms
baselines by relative improvements of 7.84\% in NDCG. We demonstrate the
necessity of adaptively selecting representations to transfer. Our model can
reduce tens of thousands training examples comparing with non-transfer methods
and still has the competitive performance with them.

finite correlation length in the disorder. At the same time the current may
resurrect when the field is modulated in time, also discontinuously: a little

between particles postpones or even avoids the current from dying, while
attraction may enhance it. We present simple models that illustrate those

collectively and its dynamics is well described by hydrodynamic models. A
significant emission asymmetry between pions and kaons, coming from collective
flow, enhanced by contribution from flowing resonances is predicted. We present
calculations within the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic model coupled to
statistical hadronization code Therminator 2, corresponding to Pb--Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We obtain femtoscopic radii and
emission asymmetry for pion-kaon pairs as a function of collision centrality.
The radii grow linearly with cube root of particle multiplicity density. The
emission asymmetry is negative and comparable to the radius, indicating that
pions are emitted closer to the center of the system and/or later than kaons.
Recent ALICE Collaboration measurements of identical kaon femtoscopy shows that
kaons are emitted, on average, 2.1~fm/$c$ later than pions. We modify our
calculation by introducing such delay and find that the system source size is
only weakly affected. In contrast the pion-kaon emission asymmetry is directly
sensitive to such delays and the modified calculation shows significantly lower
values of asymmetry. Therefore we propose the measurement of the pion-kaon
femtoscopic correlation function as a sensitive probe of the time delays in
particle emission.

assuming a thermal cosmological history this model is ruled out over most of
parameter space by collider and direct detection constraints. We show that in
theories with a non-thermal cosmological history Higgs portal dark matter is
viable for a wide range of dark matter masses and values of the portal
coupling, evading existing limits. In particular, we focus on the string theory
motivated scenario of a period of late time matter domination due to a light
modulus with a decay rate that is suppressed by the Planck scale. Dark matter
with a mass < GeV is possible without additional hidden sector states, and this
can have astrophysically relevant self-interactions. We also study the
signatures of such models at future direct, indirect, and collider experiments.
Searches for invisible Higgs decays at the high luminosity LHC or an e+ e-

complementary role.

Mexico, we construct a geography of its Lagrangian circulation within the
1500--2500-m layer. This is done by building a Markov-chain representation of
the Lagrangian dynamics. The geography is composed of weakly interacting
provinces that constrain the connectivity at depth. The main geography includes
two provinces of near equal areas and separated by a roughly meridional
boundary. The residence time is about 4.5 (3.5) years in the western (eastern)
province. The exchange between these provinces is effected through a slow
cyclonic circulation, which is well constrained in the western basin by
preservation of $f/H$, where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter and $H$ is depth.
Secondary provinces of varied shapes covering smaller areas are identified with
residence times ranging from about 0.4 to 1.2 years or so. Except for the main
provinces, the deep Lagrangian geography does not resemble the surface
Lagrangian geography recently inferred from satellite-tracked drifter
trajectories. This implies disparate connectivity characteristics with
potential implications for pollutant (e.g., oil) dispersal at the surface and
depth. A ventilation conduit through the southeastern corner of the domain from
the Caribbean Sea balanced by weak vertical exchange is also inferred. This is
supported by the inspection of satellite-tracked profiling (Argo) floats,
which, while forming a smaller dataset and having seemingly different
water-following characteristics than the RAFOS floats, replicate the main

of the learned joint representation to depict features from topology and
attributes simultaneously. Recent research on the joint embedding has exhibited
a promising performance on a variety of tasks by jointly embedding the two
spaces. However, due to the indispensable requirement of globality based
information, present approaches contain a flaw of in-scalability. Here we
propose \emph{SANE}, a scalable attribute-aware network embedding algorithm
with locality, to learn the joint representation from topology and attributes.
By enforcing the alignment of a local linear relationship between each node and
its K-nearest neighbors in topology and attribute space, the joint embedding
representations are more informative comparing with a single representation
from topology or attributes alone. And we argue that the locality in
\emph{SANE} is the key to learning the joint representation at scale. By using
several real-world networks from diverse domains, We demonstrate the efficacy
of \emph{SANE} in performance and scalability aspect. Overall, for performance
on label classification, SANE successfully reaches up to the highest F1-score
on most datasets, and even closer to the baseline method that needs label
information as extra inputs, compared with other state-of-the-art joint
representation algorithms. What's more, \emph{SANE} has an up to 71.4\%
performance gain compared with the single topology-based algorithm. For
scalability, we have demonstrated the linearly time complexity of \emph{SANE}.
In addition, we intuitively observe that when the network size scales to

Since the Mediterranean basin is one of the highly impacted regions, both by

Our study area covers the central Mediterranean crossing that connects the
western and eastern Mediterranean and is one of the areas impacted by a high

use Leeway model for lower windage small-size particles. We perform numerical

intelligent condition monitoring and diagnosis as well as prognostics used for
mechanical systems and structures has been observed. In the previous studies,
however, a major assumption accepted by default, is that the training and
testing data are taking from same feature distribution. Unfortunately, this
assumption is mostly invalid in real application, resulting in a certain lack
of applicability for the traditional diagnosis approaches. Inspired by the idea
of transfer learning that leverages the knowledge learnt from rich labeled data
in source domain to facilitate diagnosing a new but similar target task, a new
intelligent fault diagnosis framework, i.e., deep transfer network (DTN), which
generalizes deep learning model to domain adaptation scenario, is proposed in
this paper. By extending the marginal distribution adaptation (MDA) to joint
distribution adaptation (JDA), the proposed framework can exploit the
discrimination structures associated with the labeled data in source domain to
adapt the conditional distribution of unlabeled target data, and thus guarantee
a more accurate distribution matching. Extensive empirical evaluations on three
fault datasets validate the applicability and practicability of DTN, while
achieving many state-of-the-art transfer results in terms of diverse operating
conditions, fault severities and fault types.

(MIR) systems in recent years. Yet, the complex hierarchical arrangement of
music makes end-to-end learning hard for some MIR tasks - a very deep and
flexible processing chain is necessary to model some aspect of music audio.
Representations involving tones, chords, and rhythm are fundamental building
blocks of music. This paper discusses how these can be used as intermediate
targets and priors in MIR to deal with structurally complex learning problems,
with learning modules connected in a directed acyclic graph. It is suggested
that this strategy for inference, referred to as deep layered learning (DLL),
can help generalization by (1) - enforcing the validity and invariance of
intermediate representations during processing, and by (2) - letting the
inferred representations establish the musical organization to support
higher-level invariant processing. A background to modular music processing is
provided together with an overview of previous publications. Relevant concepts
from information processing, such as pruning, skip connections, and performance
supervision are reviewed within the context of DLL. A test is finally
performed, showing how layered learning affects pitch tracking. It is indicated
that especially offsets are easier to detect if guided by extracted framewise
fundamental frequencies.

  Dynamics of Networks","Version 3: Accepted version in press in Neural Computation",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe the construction and theoretical analysis of a framework derived
from canonical neurophysiological principles that model the competing dynamics
of incident signals into nodes along directed edges in a network. The framework
describes the dynamics between the offset in the latencies of propagating
signals, which reflect the geometry of the edges and conduction velocities, and
the internal refractory dynamics and processing times of the downstream node
receiving the signals. This framework naturally extends to the construction of
a perceptron model that takes into account such dynamic geometric
considerations. We first describe the model in detail, culminating with the
model of a geometric dynamic perceptron. We then derive upper and lower bounds
for a notion of optimal efficient signaling between vertex pairs based on the
structure of the framework. Efficient signaling in the context of the framework
we develop here means that there needs to be a temporal match between the
arrival time of the signals relative to how quickly nodes can internally
process signals. These bounds reflect numerical constraints on the compensation
of the timing of signaling events of upstream nodes attempting to activate
downstream nodes they connect into that preserve this notion of efficiency.
When a mismatch between signal arrival times and the internal states of
activated nodes occurs, it can cause a break down in the signaling dynamics of
the network. In contrast to essentially all the current state of the art in
machine learning, this work provides a theoretical foundation for machine
learning and intelligence architectures based on the timing of node activations
and their abilities to respond, rather than necessary changes in synaptic
weights. At the same time, this work is guiding the discovery of experimentally
testable new structure-function principles in the biological brain.
