special-relativistic Lagrangian hydrodynamics computation with simplified

exhibit hierarchical modularity: smaller modules, each of them providing a
certain function, are used within larger modules that perform more complex
functions. What is not well understood however is how this hierarchical
structure (which is fundamentally a network property) emerges, and how it
evolves over time. We propose a modeling framework, referred to as Evo-Lexis,
that provides insight to some fundamental questions about evolving hierarchical
systems. Evo-Lexis models the most elementary modules of the system as symbols
(""sources"") and the modules at the highest level of the hierarchy as sequences
of those symbols (""targets""). Evo-Lexis computes the optimized adjustment of a
given hierarchy when the set of targets changes over time by additions and
removals (a process referred to as ""incremental design""). In this paper we use
computation modeling to show that:
  - Low-cost and deep hierarchies emerge when the population of target
sequences evolves through tinkering and mutation. - Strong selection on the
cost of new candidate targets results in reuse of more complex (longer) nodes
in an optimized hierarchy. - The bias towards reuse of complex nodes results in
an ""hourglass architecture"" (i.e., few intermediate nodes that cover almost all
source-target paths). - With such bias, the core nodes are conserved for
relatively long time periods although still being vulnerable to major
transitions and punctuated equilibria. - Finally, we analyze the differences in
terms of cost and structure between incrementally designed hierarchies and the

this paper proposes a data unification framework based on traffic primitives
with ability to automatically unify and label heterogeneous traffic data. This
is achieved by two steps: 1) Carefully arrange raw multidimensional time series
driving data into a relational database and then 2) automatically extract
labeled and indexed traffic primitives from traffic data through a Bayesian
nonparametric learning method. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
developed framework using the collected real vehicle data.

billions of degrees of freedom, don't we also need billions of samples to train
it? Of course, the success of deep learning indicates that reliable models can
be learned with reasonable amounts of data. Similar questions arise in protein

adding structure to the neural network that enforces higher mutual information

an energy measurement. In the present design, the signal of the Th-229m IC
electrons is masked by low-energy electrons emitted from the surface of the
metallic stopping layer. We perform reference measurements with U-232 and U-234

correlation component and aims to facilitate concurrent descriptions of both
covalent and non-covalent molecular interactions. The vdW-DF-cx0 design mixes a
fixed ratio, $a$, of Fock exchange into the consistent-exchange van der Waals
density functional, vdW-DF-cx. The mixing value $a$ is sometimes taken as a
semi-empirical parameter in hybrid formulations. Here, instead, we assert a
plausible optimum average $a$ value for the vdW-DF-cx0 design from a formal
analysis; A new, independent determination of the mixing $a$ is necessary since
the Becke fit, yielding $a'=0.2$, is restricted to semilocal correlation and
does not reflect non-covalent interactions. To proceed, we adapt the so-called
two-legged hybrid construction to a starting point in the vdW-DF-cx functional.
For our approach, termed vdW-DF-tlh, we estimate the properties of the
adiabatic-connection specification of the exact exchange-correlation
functional, by combining calculations of the Fock exchange and of the
coupling-constant variation in vdW-DF-cx. We find that such vdW-DF-tlh hybrid
constructions yield accurate characterizations of molecular. The accuracy
motivates trust in the vdW-DF-tlh determination of system-specific values of
the Fock-exchange mixing. We find that an average value $a'=0.2$ best
characterizes the vdW-DF-tlh description of covalent and non-covalent
interactions, although there exists some scatter. This finding suggests that
the original Becke value, $a'=0.2$, also represents an optimal average
Fock-exchange mixing for the new, truly nonlocal-correlation hybrids. To enable
self-consistent calculations, we furthermore define and test a zero-parameter
hybrid functional vdW-DF-cx0p (having fixed mixing $a'=0.2$) and document that
this truly nonlocal correlation hybrid works for general molecular
interactions.

ferromagnetic insulator, is investigated under an applied hydrostatic pressure
up to 2 GPa. The easy axis direction of the magnetization is inferred from the
AMR saturation feature in the presence and absence of the applied pressure. At
zero applied pressure, the easy axis is along the c-direction or perpendicular
to the layer. Upon application of a hydrostatic pressure>1 GPa, the uniaxial
anisotropy switches to easy-plane anisotropy which drives the equilibrium
magnetization from the c-axis to the ab-plane at zero magnetic field, which
amounts to a giant magnetic anisotropy energy change (>100%). As the
temperature is increased across the Curie temperature, the characteristic AMR
effect gradually decreases and disappears. Our first-principles calculations
confirm the giant magnetic anisotropy energy change with moderate pressure and
assign its origin to the increased off-site spin-orbit interaction of Te atoms
due to a shorter Cr-Te distance. Such a pressure-induced spin reorientation
transition is very rare in three-dimensional ferromagnets, but it may be common
to other layered ferromagnets with similar crystal structures to CGT, and
therefore offers a unique way to control magnetic anisotropy.

was confirmed by fabricating a chiral sculptured thin film and measuring the

Signatures of the circular Bragg phenomenon are evident in the spectra of all
reflectances, transmittances, absorptances, and dichroisms. Reversal of the

propose a unified framework to tackle these two problems simultaneously. The
uniqueness of our design is a sensor fusion scheme which integrates camera
videos, motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and a 3D semantic map in order to achieve
robustness and efficiency of the system. Specifically, we first have an initial
coarse camera pose obtained from consumer-grade GPS/IMU, based on which a label
map can be rendered from the 3D semantic map. Then, the rendered label map and
the RGB image are jointly fed into a pose CNN, yielding a corrected camera
pose. In addition, to incorporate temporal information, a multi-layer recurrent
neural network (RNN) is further deployed improve the pose accuracy. Finally,
based on the pose from RNN, we render a new label map, which is fed together
with the RGB image into a segment CNN which produces per-pixel semantic label.
In order to validate our approach, we build a dataset with registered 3D point
clouds and video camera images. Both the point clouds and the images are
semantically-labeled. Each video frame has ground truth pose from highly
accurate motion sensors. We show that practically, pose estimation solely
relying on images like PoseNet may fail due to street view confusion, and it is
important to fuse multiple sensors. Finally, various ablation studies are
performed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. In
particular, we show that scene parsing and pose estimation are mutually
beneficial to achieve a more robust and accurate system.

the remaining nine are systems already analyzed by our team for which we

eclipsing binaries in the Magellanic Clouds suitable for high-precision
determination of distances (the Araucaria project). The V-band brightnesses of
the systems range from 15.4 mag to 17.7 mag and their orbital periods range
from 49 days to 773 days. Six systems have favorable geometry showing total
eclipses. The absolute dimensions of all eclipsing binary components are
calculated with a precision of better than 3% and all systems are suitable for
a precise distance determination. The measured stellar masses are in the range
1.4 to 4.6 M_sun and comparison with the MESA isochrones gives ages between 0.1

have components with very different masses: OGLE LMC-ECL-05430 and OGLE
LMC-ECL-18365. Neither system can be fitted by single stellar evolution
isochrone, explained by a past mass transfer scenario in the case of ECL-18365
and a gravitational capture or a hierarchical binary merger scenario in the
case of ECL-05430. The longest period system OGLE LMC SC9 230659 shows a
surprising apsidal motion which shifts the apparent position of the eclipses.
In one spectrum of OGLE LMC-ECL-12669 we noted a peculiar dimming of one of the
components by 65% well outside of the eclipses. We interpret this observation
as arising from an extremely rare occultation event as a foreground Galactic
object covers only one component of an extragalactic eclipsing binary.

remember observations and actions across sizable time intervals. This is
especially true during the initial learning stages, when exploratory behaviour
can increase the delay between specific actions and their effects. Many new or
popular approaches for learning these distant correlations employ
backpropagation through time (BPTT), but this technique requires storing
observation traces long enough to span the interval between cause and effect.
Besides memory demands, learning dynamics like vanishing gradients and slow
convergence due to infrequent weight updates can reduce BPTT's practicality;
meanwhile, although online recurrent network learning is a developing topic,
most approaches are not efficient enough to use as replacements. We propose a
simple, effective memory strategy that can extend the window over which BPTT
can learn without requiring longer traces. We explore this approach empirically
on a few tasks and discuss its implications.

change unless there is a legitimate deliberate modification. Classical fault
attacks show that this assumption does not hold if the attacker has physical
access. Rowhammer attacks showed that local code execution is already
sufficient to break this assumption. Rowhammer exploits parasitic effects in
DRAM to modify the content of a memory cell without accessing it. Instead,
other memory locations are accessed at a high frequency. All Rowhammer attacks
so far were local attacks, running either in a scripted language or native
code. In this paper, we present Nethammer. Nethammer is the first truly remote
Rowhammer attack, without a single attacker-controlled line of code on the
targeted system. Systems that use uncached memory or flush instructions while
handling network requests, e.g., for interaction with the network device, can
be attacked using Nethammer. Other systems can still be attacked if they are
protected with quality-of-service techniques like Intel CAT. We demonstrate
that the frequency of the cache misses is in all three cases high enough to
induce bit flips. We evaluated different bit flip scenarios. Depending on the
location, the bit flip compromises either the security and integrity of the
system and the data of its users, or it can leave persistent damage on the
system, i.e., persistent denial of service. We investigated Nethammer on
personal computers, servers, and mobile phones. Nethammer is a security
landslide, making the formerly local attack a remote attack.

media. The Langevin equation is converted to the Fokker--Planck (FP) equation
for the probability distribution by employing the technique of functional
integral on the assumption of the Gaussian white noise for the random
fluctuation. The specific application is considered for the optical rotation,
which is described by the ellipticity (third component of the Stokes
parameters) alone: (i) The asymptotic analysis is given for the functional
integral, which leads to the transition rate on the Poincar{'e} sphere. (ii)
The FP equation is analyzed in the strong coupling approximation, by which the
diffusive behavior is obtained for the linear and nonlinear birefringence.
These would provide with a basis of statistical analysis for the polarization
phenomena in nonlinear birefringent media.

much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of
individual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not
rigorously quantified the distortions in brain geometry from in-vivo to ex-vivo
brains due to the tissue processing, which will be important when computing
properties such as local cell and process densities at the voxel level in
creating reference brain maps. Further, existing approaches focus on
registering uni-modal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest
in the marmoset model for neuroscience research, it is necessary to
cross-register multi-modal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological
series that can help address individual variations in brain architecture. Here
we present a computational approach for same-subject multimodal MRI guided
reconstruction of a histological series, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to
a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during the different stages of
histological processing of the brains using the Jacobian determinant of the
diffeomorphic transformations involved. There are two major steps in the
histology process with associated scale distortions (a) brain perfusion (b)
histological sectioning and reassembly. By mapping the final image stacks to
the ex-vivo post fixation MRI, we show that tape-transfer histology can be
reassembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 $\pm$
0.4% per axis dimension. In contrast, the perfusion step, as assessed by
mapping the in-vivo MRIs to the ex-vivo post fixation MRIs, shows a larger
local scale change of 6.9 $\pm$ 2.1% per axis dimension. This is the first
systematic quantification of the local metric distortions associated with
whole-brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will
generalize to other species.

that the proposed supervised classification method can reliably distinguish

we seek insight into the impact of the choice of the multiple access scheme by
developing solutions to the mobile energy minimization problem in the two-user
case with plentiful shared computational resources. In that setting, the
allocation of communication resources is constrained by the latency constraints
of the applications, the computational capabilities and the transmission power
constraints of the devices, and the achievable rate region of the chosen
multiple access scheme. For both indivisible tasks and the limiting case of
tasks that can be infinitesimally partitioned, we provide a closed-form and
quasi-closed-form solution, respectively, for systems that can exploit the full
capabilities of the multiple access channel, and for systems based on
time-division multiple access (TDMA). For indivisible tasks, we also provide
quasi-closed-form solutions for systems that employ sequential decoding without
time sharing or independent decoding. Analyses of our results show that when
the channel gains are equal and the transmission power budgets are larger than
a threshold, TDMA (and the suboptimal multiple access schemes that we have
considered) can achieve an optimal solution. However, when the channel gains of
each user are significantly different and the latency constraints are tight,
systems that take advantage of the full capabilities of the multiple access

(b) the unstructured semantic content (e.g., text) associated with nodes; and
(c) online updates due to incoming new nodes in growing network. We address
these challenges by developing a Content-Aware Representation Learning model
(CARL). CARL performs joint optimization of heterogeneous SkipGram and deep
semantic encoding for capturing both heterogeneous structural closeness and
unstructured semantic relations among all nodes, as function of node content,
that exist in the network. Furthermore, an additional online update module is
proposed for efficiently learning representations of incoming nodes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CARL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link prediction, document
retrieval, node recommendation and relevance search. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of the CARL's online update module through a category
visualization study.

range of values associated with each cluster's elements. In clustering or
classification the objective is to partition a set of objects into subsets,
called clusters or classes, consisting of similar objects so that different
clusters are as dissimilar as possible. We propose a number of objective
functions that employ the range of the clusters as part of the objective
function. Several of the proposed objectives mimic objectives based on sums of
similarities. These objective functions are motivated by image segmentation
problems, where the diameter, or range of values associated with objects in
each cluster, should be small. It is demonstrated that range-based problems are
in general easier, in terms of their complexity, than the analogous
similarity-sum problems. Several of the problems we present could therefore be
viable alternatives to existing clustering problems which are NP-hard, offering
the advantage of efficient algorithms.

conventional online motor imagery with feedback (such as rewarding sounds and

participated in BCI-FES rehabilitation training for 4 weeks.The average motor
imagery accuracies of the ten patients in the last week were 71.3%, which has
improved 3% than that in the first week. Five patients' Fugl-Meyer Assessment

over two years, achieved the greatest improvement after rehabilitation training

that the properties picked out by base nouns tend to be related to shape, while
prenominal adjectives tend to refer to other properties such as color. We show
that children applying such inductive biases are accurately reflecting the

statistical signal and image processing, drawing on linear algebra and
stochastic process theory. However, digitized neuroanatomical data sets
containing labelled neurons, either individually or in groups labelled by
tracer injections, do not fully fit into this classical framework. The
tree-like shapes of neurons cannot mathematically be adequately described as
points in a vector space. There is therefore a need for new approaches. Methods
from computational topology and geometry are naturally suited to the analysis
of neuronal shapes. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse Theory to
extract tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data,
or to summarize collections of neurons labelled by localized anterograde tracer
injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to
summarize the collection of neurons labelled by a localized anterograde tracer
injection using a consensus tree-shape. The algorithmic procedure includes an
initial pre-processing step to extract a density field from the raw volumetric
image data, followed by initial skeleton extraction from the density field
using a discrete version of a 1-(un)stable manifold of the density field.
Heuristically, if the density field is regarded as a mountainous landscape,
then the 1-(un)stable manifold follows the ""mountain ridges"" connecting the
maxima of the density field. We then simplify this skeleton-graph into a tree
using a shortest-path approach and methods derived from persistent homology.
The advantage of this approach is that it uses global information about the
density field and is therefore robust to local fluctuations and non-uniformly
distributed input signals. To be able to handle large data sets, we use a
divide-and-conquer approach. The resulting software DiMorSC is available on

precision data. However these high-quality, resolved observations are only
possible for handful of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Future HI surveys
are unlikely to improve the current situation. We therefore explore a method
for estimating the surface density of the atomic gas from global HI parameters,
which are conversely widely available. We perform empirical tests using
galaxies with resolved HI maps, and find that our approximation produces values
for the surface density of atomic hydrogen within typically 0.5dex of the true
value. We apply this method to a sample of 147 galaxies drawn from modern
near-infrared stellar photometric surveys. With this sample we confirm a strict
correlation between the atomic gas surface density and the star formation rate
surface density, that is vertically offset from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
by a factor of 10-30, and significantly steeper than the classical N=1.4 of
Kennicutt (1998). We further infer the molecular fraction in the sample of low
surface brightness, predominantly dwarf galaxies by assuming that the star
formation relationship with molecular gas observed for spiral galaxies also
holds in these galaxies, finding a molecular-to-atomic gas mass fraction within
the range of 5-15%. Comparison of the data to available models shows that a
model in which the thermal pressure balances the vertical gravitational field
captures better the shape of the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}-\Sigma_{\rm gas}$
relationship. However, such models fail to reproduce the data completely,
suggesting that thermal pressure plays an important role in the disks of dwarf
galaxies.

is a significant difference between the ratio of label change due to the
perturbations. Observing this, we design a statistical adversary detection

two specific morphologies, {\it viz.} compact and string-like aggregates. We
focus on the temporal evolution of the mobility of an individual particle and
the dynamic change in its nearest neighbourhood, measured in terms of the
Debye-Waller factor ($\bar{u}_i^2$) and the non-affine parameter ($\chi$),
respectively (defined in the text), and their interrelation over several
lengths of observation time $\tau_w$. The distribution for both measures are
found to follow the relation: $P(x;\tau_w) \sim \tau_w^{-\gamma}x$ for the

respectively, for the compact and string-like morphologies following the ideal
fractal dimension of these aggregates. A functional dependence between these
two observables is determined from a detailed statistical analysis of their
joint and conditional distributions. The results obtained can readily be used
and verified by experiments on aggregate forming systems such as globular
proteins, nanoparticle self-assembly etc. Further, the insights gained from
this study might be useful to understand the evolution of collective dynamics

fluctuations depend on the underlying geometry. We consider in details two
examples of 2D systems for which imposed external constraints force the
underlying stationary stochastic process to stay in an atypical regime with
anomalous statistics. The first example deals with the fluctuations of a
stretched 2D random walk above a semicircle or a triangle. In the second

heuristic derivations of scaling exponents $\gamma$ for different geometries,

pharmacokinetics (PK) is typically analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effect models
(NLMM). Applying NLMM to large-scale data, such as those generated by
genome-wide studies, raises several issues related to the assumption of random
effects, as follows: (i) Computation time: it takes a long time to compute the
marginal likelihood. (ii) Convergence of iterative calculation: an adaptive
Gauss-Hermite quadrature is generally used to estimate NLMM; however, iterative
calculations may not converge in complex models. (iii) Random-effects
misspecification leads to slightly inflated type-I error rates. As an
alternative effective approach to resolving these issues, in this article we
propose a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach for analyzing
population PK data. In general, GEE analysis does not account for
inter-individual variability in PK parameters; therefore, the usual GEE
estimators cannot be interpreted straightforwardly, and their validities have
not been justified. Here, we propose valid inference methods for using GEE even
under conditions of inter-individual variability, and provide theoretical
justifications of the proposed GEE estimators for population PK data. In
numerical evaluations by simulations, the proposed GEE approach exhibited high
computational speed and stability relative to the NLMM approach. Furthermore,
the NLMM analysis was sensitive to the misspecification of the random-effects
distribution, and the proposed GEE inference is valid for any distributional
form. An illustration is provided using data from a genome-wide pharmacogenomic

of $e^2/2\pi\hbar$, which is associated with edge currents of electrons or
quasiparticles with fractional charges, respectively. Here we discover a novel
type of quantization of the Hall effect in an insulating 2D quantum magnet. In
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with dominant Kitaev interaction on 2D honeycomb lattice, the
application of a parallel magnetic field destroys the long-range magnetic
order, leading to a field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state with
massive entanglement of local spins. In the low-temperature regime of the QSL
state, we report that the 2D thermal Hall conductance $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}$
reaches a quantum plateau as a function of applied magnetic field.
$\kappa_{xy}^{2D}/T$ attains a quantization value of $(\pi/12)(k_B^2/\hbar)$,
which is exactly half of $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}/T$ in the integer QHE. This
half-integer thermal Hall conductance observed in a bulk material is a direct
signature of topologically protected chiral edge currents of charge neutral
Majorana fermions, particles that are their own antiparticles, which possess
half degrees of freedom of conventional fermions. These signatures demonstrate
the fractionalization of spins into itinerant Majorana fermions and $Z_2$
fluxes predicted in a Kitaev QSL. Above a critical magnetic field, the
quantization disappears and $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}/T$ goes to zero rapidly,
indicating a topological quantum phase transition between the states with and
without chiral Majorana edge modes. Emergent Majorana fermions in a quantum
magnet are expected to have a major impact on strongly correlated topological
quantum matter.

topologies via topology control (TC) algorithms is an important cross-cutting
research area. Network topologies are usually modeled using attributed graphs
whose nodes and edges represent the network nodes and their interconnecting
links. A key requirement of TC algorithms is to fulfill certain consistency and
optimization properties to ensure a high quality of service. Still, few
attempts have been made to constructively integrate these properties into the
development process of TC algorithms. Furthermore, even though many TC
algorithms share substantial parts (such as structural patterns or tie-breaking
strategies), few works constructively leverage these commonalities and
differences of TC algorithms systematically. In previous work, we addressed the
constructive integration of consistency properties into the development
process. We outlined a constructive, model-driven methodology for designing
individual TC algorithms. Valid and high-quality topologies are characterized
using declarative graph constraints; TC algorithms are specified using
programmed graph transformation. We applied a well-known static analysis
technique to refine a given TC algorithm in a way that the resulting algorithm
preserves the specified graph constraints.
  In this paper, we extend our constructive methodology by generalizing it to
support the specification of families of TC algorithms. To show the feasibility
of our approach, we reneging six existing TC algorithms and develop e-kTC, a
novel energy-efficient variant of the TC algorithm kTC. Finally, we evaluate a

demonstrated two-qubit fidelities near the fault-tolerant threshold.
Silicon-based quantum dot qubits are also amenable to large-scale manufacture
and can achieve high single-qubit gate fidelities (exceeding 99.9%) using
isotopically enriched silicon. However, while two-qubit gates have been
demonstrated in silicon, it has not yet been possible to rigorously assess
their fidelities using randomized benchmarking, since this requires sequences
of significant numbers of qubit operations ($\gtrsim 20$) to be completed with
non-vanishing fidelity. Here, for qubits encoded on the electron spin states of
gate-defined quantum dots, we demonstrate Bell state tomography with fidelities
ranging from 80% to 89%, and two-qubit randomized benchmarking with an average
Clifford gate fidelity of 94.7% and average Controlled-ROT (CROT) fidelity of

times employed here compared with the decoherence times $T_2^*$ of the qubits.
Silicon qubit designs employing fast gate operations based on high Rabi
frequencies, together with advanced pulsing techniques, should therefore enable
significantly higher fidelities in the near future.

many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the

representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to

integrity of our InSb quantum wells is solely determined by the growth
conditions at the GaSb/InAlSb transition and the InAlSb barrier growth. The
two-dimensional electron gas samples show high mobilities of up to 349 000
cm$^2$/Vs at cryogenic temperatures and 58 000 cm$^2$/Vs at room temperature.
With the calculated Dingle ratio and a transport lifetime model, ionized
impurities predominantly remote from the quantum well are identified as the
dominant source of scattering events. The analysis of the well pronounced
Shubnikov$-$de Haas oscillations reveals a high spin-orbit coupling with an
effective $g$-factor of $-38.4$ in our samples. Along with the smooth surfaces
and long mean free paths demonstrated, our InSb quantum wells are increasingly
competitive for nanoscale implementations of Majorana mode devices.

information-theoretically secure key shared by two legitimate parties. QKD
consists of two parts: quantum and classical. The latter is referred to as
classical post-processing (CPP). Information reconciliation is a part of CPP in
which parties are given correlated variables and attempt to eliminate the
discrepancies between them while disclosing a minimum amount of information.
The elegant reconciliation protocol known as \emph{Cascade} was developed
specifically for QKD in 1992 and has become the de-facto standard for all QKD
implementations. However, the protocol is highly interactive. Thus, other
protocols based on linear block codes such as Hamming codes, low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes, and polar codes have been researched. In particular,
reconciliation using LDPC codes has been mainly studied because of its
outstanding performance. Nevertheless, with small block size, the bit error
rate performance of polar codes under successive-cancellation list (SCL)
decoding with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is comparable to state-of-the-art
turbo and LDPC codes. In this study, we demonstrate the use of polar codes to
improve the performance of information reconciliation in a QKD system with
small block size. The best decoder for polar codes, a CRC-aided SCL decoder,
requires CRC-precoded messages. However, messages that are sifted keys in QKD
are obtained arbitrarily as a result of a characteristic of the QKD protocol
and cannot be CRC-precoded. We propose a method that allows arbitrarily
obtained sifted keys to be CRC precoded by introducing a virtual string. Thus
the best decoder can be used for reconciliation using polar codes and improves
the efficiency of the protocol.

effect of a fermionic field confined a three-dimensional rectangular box. The
analytic expressions of the Casimir energy and Casimir force are derived for
arbitrary temperature and edge sizes. The low and high temperature limits and
finite temperature cases are considered for the entire parameter space spanned
by edge sizes and/or temperature. In the low temperature limit, it is found
that for typical rectangular box, the effective 2-dimensional parameter space
spanned by the two edge size ratios can be split into four regions according to
the nature of the forces. For the waveguide under low temperature, the Casimir
force along the longer side of the waveguide cross-section transforms from
attractive to repulsive when the aspect ratio of the cross-section exceed a
critical value. For the parallel plate scenario under low temperature, our
results agrees with previous works. For the finite temperature case, we
separate the parameter space into four subcases and various edge size and
temperature effects are analyzed. In general, we found that in all cases the
Casimir energy is always negative, while the Casimir force at any finite or low
temperature can be either repulsive or attractive depending on the sizes of the
edges. Finally, for any fixed temperature, there exist a boundary in the
parameter space of edge sizes separating the attractive and repulsive regions.
Besides, the Casimir energy for an electromagnetic field confined in a
three-dimensional box is also derived.

close to the BCG. In this particular image, an intrinsically compact region in
one of the spiral arms is lensed into an arc that curves towards the BCG
center. This arc has a radius of curvature of only $\sim$0.""6, betraying the
presence of a local compact deflector. Its curvature is most simply reproduced
by a point-like object with a mass of $8.4^{+4.3}_{-1.8}\times10^{9}M_\odot$,
similar to SMBH masses in local elliptical galaxies having comparable
luminosities. The SMBH is noticeably offset by $4.4\pm0.3$ kpc from the BCG
light centre, plausibly the result of a kick imparted $\sim2.0\times10^7$ years
ago during the merger of two SMBHs, placing it just beyond the stellar core. A
similar curvature can be produced by replacing the offset SMBH with a compact
galaxy having a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ within a cutoff radius of
$<4$ kpc, and an unusually large $M/L>50(M/L)_\odot$ to make it undetectable in

such a lensing galaxy, however, perturbs the adjacent lensed images in an
undesirable way.

human lives at unprecedented pace and scale. This book portrays ML as the
combination of three basic components: data, model and loss. ML methods combine
these three components within computationally efficient implementations of the
basic scientific principle ""trial and error"". This principle consists of the
continuous adaptation of a hypothesis about a phenomenon that generates data.
ML methods use a hypothesis to compute predictions for future events. We
believe that thinking about ML as combinations of three components given by
data, model, and loss helps to navigate the steadily growing offer for
ready-to-use ML methods. Our three-component picture of ML allows a unified
treatment of a wide range of concepts and techniques which seem quite unrelated
at first sight. The regularization effect of early stopping in iterative
methods is due to the shrinking of the effective hypothesis space.
Privacy-preserving ML is obtained by particular choices for the features of
data points. Explainable ML methods are characterized by particular choices for
the hypothesis space. To make good use of ML tools it is instrumental to
understand its underlying principles at different levels of detail. On a lower

areas of life science. Of particular interest are homeostasis mechanisms, which
buffer growth and division from accumulating fluctuations over multiple cycles.
These mechanisms operate within single cells, possibly extending over several
division cycles. However, all experimental studies to date have relied on
measurements pooled from many distinct cells. Here, we disentangle long-term
measured traces of individual cells from one another, revealing subtle
differences between temporal and pooled statistics. By analyzing correlations
along up to hundreds of generations, we find that the parameter describing
effective cell-size homeostasis strength varies significantly among cells. At
the same time, we find an invariant cell size which acts as an attractor to all
individual traces, albeit with different effective attractive forces. Despite
the common attractor, each cell maintains a distinct average size over its
finite lifetime with suppressed temporal fluctuations around it, and
equilibration to the global average size is surprisingly slow (> 150 cell
cycles). To demonstrate a possible source of variable homeostasis strength, we
construct a mathematical model relying on intracellular interactions, which
integrates measured properties of cell size with those of highly expressed
proteins. Effective homeostasis strength is then influenced by interactions and
by noise levels, and generally varies among cells. A predictable and measurable
consequence of variable homeostasis strength appears as distinct oscillatory
patterns in cell size and protein content over many generations. We discuss the
implications of our results to understanding mechanisms controlling division in
single cells and their characteristic timescales

a projected separation using a photometric reference sample, N_neighbour(<r_p).
We compare the results with the measurements of control samples matched in

the bulge type is related to intermediate-to-large scale environments. On

strong excess in close neighbour count when compared to control galaxies, at

described ""an odd kind of sympathy"" between two pendulums mounted side by side
on a wooden beam, which inspired the modern studies of synchronization in
coupled nonlinear oscillators. Despite the blooming of synchronization study in
a variety of disciplines, the original phenomenon described by Huygens remains
a puzzle to researchers. Here, by placing two mechanical metronomes on top of a
freely moving plastic board, we revisit the synchronization experiment
conducted by Huygens. Experimental results show that by introducing a small
mismatch to the natural frequencies of the metronomes, the probability for
generating the anti-phase synchronization (APS) state, i.e., the ""odd sympathy""
described by Huygens, can be clearly increased. By numerical simulations of the
system dynamics, we conduct a detailed analysis on the influence of frequency
mismatch on APS. It is found that as the frequency mismatch increases from $0$,
the attracting basin of APS is gradually enlarged and, in the meantime, the
basin of in-phase synchronization (IPS) is reduced. However, as the frequency
mismatch exceeds some critical value, both the basins of APS and IPS are
suddenly disappeared, resulting in the desynchronization states. The impacts of
friction coefficient and synchronization precision on APS are also studied, and
it is found that with the increases of the friction coefficient and the
precision requirement of APS, the critical frequency mismatch for
desynchronization will be decreased. Our study indicates that, instead of luck,
Huygens might have introduced, deliberately and elaborately, a small frequency
mismatch to the pendulums in his experiment for generating the ""odd sympathy"".

provided strategies achieving such a bi-optimality in the parametric case of

equity issuance at any point in time. The value is characterized as the fixed
point of an optimal control problem with periodic initial and terminal
conditions. We prove the regularity and uniqueness of the corresponding dynamic
programming equation, and the convergence of an efficient numerical algorithm
that we use to study the problem. The model enables us to find the loss caused
by infrequent dividend payments. We show that under realistic parameter values
this loss varies from around 1% to 24% depending on the state of the system,
and that using the optimal policy from the continuous problem further increases
the loss.

to the next-nearest-neighbors and broken time-reversal symmetry, which exhibits
edge states in the absence of an external magnetic field. The question of
chiral edge states is approached in the ribbon and plaquette geometries with
different atomic connectivities at the boundaries. Insulating and semi-metallic
phases are revealed, the resulting phase diagram being richer than in Haldane's
model. The transmission coefficients and the Hall resistance $R_H$ are
calculated for the finite size system in the Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism.
The quantized values $R_H=\pm h/e^2$, specific to the Chern insulator, are
manifest in the energy range occupied by the chiral edge states, corresponding
to the unique gap existing in the energy spectrum. Our second aim is to examine
the disorder-induced properties of the model, and, as a novelty, we prove the
disorder-driven AQHE in the semi-metallic phase.

capability of event prediction. To remedy this, we propose constructing an
event graph to better utilize the event network information for script event
prediction. In particular, we first extract narrative event chains from large
quantities of news corpus, and then construct a narrative event evolutionary
graph (NEEG) based on the extracted chains. NEEG can be seen as a knowledge
base that describes event evolutionary principles and patterns. To solve the
inference problem on NEEG, we present a scaled graph neural network (SGNN) to
model event interactions and learn better event representations. Instead of
computing the representations on the whole graph, SGNN processes only the
concerned nodes each time, which makes our model feasible to large-scale
graphs. By comparing the similarity between input context event representations
and candidate event representations, we can choose the most reasonable
subsequent event. Experimental results on widely used New York Times corpus
demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline
methods, by using standard multiple choice narrative cloze evaluation.

social web service account of a visitor to an attacker's website. Our attack
leverages the widely adopted user-blocking mechanism, abusing its inherent
property that certain pages return different web content depending on whether a
user is blocked from another user. Our key insight is that an account prepared
by an attacker can hold an attacker-controllable binary state of
blocking/non-blocking with respect to an arbitrary user on the same service;
provided that the user is logged in to the service, this state can be retrieved
as one-bit data through the conventional cross-site timing attack when a user
visits the attacker's website. We generalize and refer to such a property as
visibility control, which we consider as the fundamental assumption of our
attack. Building on this primitive, we show that an attacker with a set of
controlled accounts can gain a complete and flexible control over the data
leaked through the side channel. Using this mechanism, we show that it is
possible to design and implement a robust, large-scale user identification
attack on a wide variety of social web services. To verify the feasibility of
our attack, we perform an extensive empirical study using 16 popular social web
services and demonstrate that at least 12 of these are vulnerable to our
attack. Vulnerable services include not only popular social networking sites
such as Twitter and Facebook, but also other types of web services that provide
social features, e.g., eBay and Xbox Live. We also demonstrate that the attack
can achieve nearly 100% accuracy and can finish within a sufficiently short

research, current approaches still fall short of natural intelligences in one
important regard: they require external supervision, such as explicit access to
physical states, at training and sometimes even at test times. Some authors
have relaxed such requirements by supplementing the model with an handcrafted
physical simulator. Still, the resulting methods are unable to automatically
learn new complex environments and to understand physical interactions within
them. In this work, we demonstrated for the first time learning such predictors
directly from raw visual observations and without relying on simulators. We do
so in two steps: first, we learn to track mechanically-salient objects in
videos using causality and equivariance, two unsupervised learning principles
that do not require auto-encoding. Second, we demonstrate that the extracted
positions are sufficient to successfully train visual motion predictors that
can take the underlying environment into account. We validate our predictors on
synthetic datasets; then, we introduce a new dataset, ROLL4REAL, consisting of
real objects rolling on complex terrains (pool table, elliptical bowl, and
random height-field). We show that in all such cases it is possible to learn
reliable extrapolators of the object trajectories from raw videos alone,
without any form of external supervision and with no more prior knowledge than
the choice of a convolutional neural network architecture.

optimal stopping theory. In a typical prophet or secretary problem, selection
decisions are assumed to be immediate and irrevocable. However, many online
settings accommodate some degree of revocability. To study such scenarios, we
introduce the $\ell-out-of-k$ setting, where the decision maker can select up
to $k$ elements immediately and irrevocably, but her performance is measured by
the top $\ell$ elements in the selected set. Equivalently, the decision makes
can hold up to $\ell$ elements at any given point in time, but can make up to
$k-\ell$ returns as new elements arrive.
  We give upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of $\ell$-out-of-$k$
prophet and secretary scenarios. These include a single-sample prophet
algorithm that gives a competitive ratio of $1-\ell\cdot
e^{-\Theta\left(\frac{\left(k-\ell\right)^2}{k}\right)}$, which is
asymptotically tight for $k-\ell=\Theta(\ell)$. For secretary settings, we
devise an algorithm that obtains a competitive ratio of $1-\ell
e^{-\frac{k-8\ell}{2+2\ln \ell}} - e^{-k/6}$, and show that no secretary
algorithm obtains a better ratio than $1-e^{-k}$ (up to negligible terms). In
passing, our results lead to an improvement of the results of Assaf et al.

results have implications to mechanism design. In particular, we use our
prophet algorithms to derive {\em overbooking} mechanisms with good welfare and

develops rapidly and is applied to many tasks, such as image classification,
face recognition, image segmentation, and human detection. Due to its superior
performance, DL-based models have a wide range of application in many areas,
some of which are extremely safety-critical, e.g. intelligent surveillance and
autonomous driving. Due to the latency and privacy problem of cloud computing,
embedded accelerators are popular in these safety-critical areas. However, the
robustness of the embedded DL system might be harmed by inserting
hardware/software Trojans into the accelerator and the neural network model,
since the accelerator and deploy tool (or neural network model) are usually
provided by third-party companies. Fortunately, inserting hardware Trojans can
only achieve inflexible attack, which means that hardware Trojans can easily
break down the whole system or exchange two outputs, but can't make CNN
recognize unknown pictures as targets. Though inserting software Trojans has
more freedom of attack, it often requires tampering input images, which is not
easy for attackers. So, in this paper, we propose a hardware-software
collaborative attack framework to inject hidden neural network Trojans, which
works as a back-door without requiring manipulating input images and is
flexible for different scenarios. We test our attack framework for image
classification and face recognition tasks, and get attack success rate of 92.6%
and 100% on CIFAR10 and YouTube Faces, respectively, while keeping almost the
same accuracy as the unattacked model in the normal mode. In addition, we show
a specific attack scenario in which a face recognition system is attacked and
gives a specific wrong answer.

B-mode images is delay and sum (DAS) beamforming. However, DAS often results in
limited image resolution and contrast, which are governed by the center
frequency and the aperture size of the ultrasound transducer. A large number of
elements leads to improved resolution but at the same time increases the data
size and the system cost due to the receive electronics required for each
element. Therefore, reducing the number of receiving channels while producing
high quality images is of great importance. In this paper, we introduce a
nonlinear beamformer called COnvolutional Beamforming Algorithm (COBA), which
achieves significant improvement of lateral resolution and contrast. In
addition, it can be implemented efficiently using the fast Fourier transform.
Based on the COBA concept, we next present two sparse beamformers with closed
form expressions for the sensor locations, which result in the same beam
pattern as DAS and COBA while using far fewer array elements. Optimization of
the number of elements shows that they require a minimal number of elements
which is on the order of the square root of the number used by DAS. The
performance of the proposed methods is tested and validated using simulated
data, phantom scans and in vivo cardiac data. The results demonstrate that COBA
outperforms DAS in terms of resolution and contrast and that the suggested
beamformers offer a sizable element reduction while generating images with an
equivalent or improved quality in comparison to DAS.

scenario where a colloidal particle is kept at an elevated temperature than the
ambient fluid. Due to the time scale separation between heat diffusion and
particle motion, a stationary halo of hot fluid is carried along with the
particle, resulting in a spatially varying comoving temperature and viscosity
profile. The resultant Brownian motion in the overdamped limit can be well
described by a Langevin equation with effective parameters such as effective
temperature $T_{\rm HBM}$ and friction coefficient $\zeta_{\rm HBM}$ that
quantifies the thermal fluctuations and the diffusivity of the particle. These
parameters can exactly be calculated using the framework of fluctuating
hydrodynamics. Additionally, it was also observed that configurational and the
kinetic degrees of freedom admits to different effective temperatures,
$T^{\mathbf{x}}_{\rm HBM}$ and $T^{\mathbf{v}}_{\rm HBM}$, respectively, with
the former predicted accurately from fluctuating hydrodynamics. A more rigorous
calculation by Falasco et. al. Physical Review E , 90, $032131(2014)$ extends
the overdamped description to a generalized Langevin equation where the
effective temperature becomes frequency dependent and consequently, for any
temperature measurement from a Brownian trajectory requires the knowledge of
this frequency dependence. We use this framework to expand on this earlier work
and look at the first order correction to the effective temperature. The
effective temperature is calculated from the weighted average of the
temperature field with the dissipation function. Further, we provide a closed
form analytical result for effective temperature in the small as well high
frequency limit and using this we determine the kinetic temperature from the
generalized Langevin equation and the Wiener-Khinchine theorem.

corresponding to a fractional increase of $\Delta \nu / \nu = 0.516 \times
10^{-6}$ making this event the largest glitch ever observed in this source. Due
to our high-cadence and long-dwell time observations of the Crab pulsar we are
able to partially resolve a fraction of the total spin-up of the star. This
delayed spin-up occurred over a timescale of $\sim$1.7 days and is similar to
the behaviour seen in the 1989 and 1996 large Crab pulsar glitches. The
spin-down rate also increased at the glitch epoch by $\Delta \dot{\nu} /
\dot{\nu} = 7 \times 10^{-3}$. In addition to being the largest such event
observed in the Crab, the glitch occurred after the longest period of glitch
inactivity since at least 1984 and we discuss a possible relationship between
glitch size and waiting time. No changes to the shape of the pulse profile were
observed near the glitch epoch at 610 MHz or 1520 MHz, nor did we identify any
changes in the X-ray flux from the pulsar. The long-term recovery from the
glitch continues to progress as $\dot{\nu}$ slowly rises towards pre-glitch

persistent change to $\dot{\nu}$. We continue to monitor the long-term recovery

operating cost benefits of grid-scale energy storage decline as installed
storage capacity increases? We use a 240-bus model based on the US Western
Interconnection, first optimally locating storage in the network and then
dispatching it in a unit commitment model with DC load flow. The model uses
storage to provide frequency regulation, load following, and arbitrage for each
hour of a study year, and we investigate a range of scenarios for fuel price
and renewables penetration. We find that value from long-term energy shifting
is negligible at all penetrations we investigate, but also that displacing
fossil-fueled generators from providing reserves is initially very valuable.
However, in most scenarios the value is negligible beyond 10 GWh of storage, or
the equivalent of roughly 6 minutes of average demand in the system. Above
penetrations of 4-8 GWh, storage operating cost benefits are less than
estimated capacity values for storage. We also show that storage has the
potential to increase overall carbon emissions in the electricity sector, even
when it is not providing significant amounts of arbitrage and is preferentially
providing regulation and load following services.

that applies to bianisotropic metasurfaces that are embedded in symmetric or
asymmetric environments. Specifically, we use general zero-thickness sheet
transition conditions to relate the propagation constants of surface-wave modes
to the bianisotropic susceptibility components of the metasurface, which can
themselves be directly related to its scattering parameters. It is then
possible to either obtain the metasurface dispersion diagram from its known
susceptibilities or, alternatively, compute the susceptibilities required to
achieve a desired surface-wave propagation. The validity of the method is
demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained with exact dispersion
relations of well known structures such as the propagation of surface plasmons
on thin metallic films. In particular, this work reveals that it is possible to
achieve surface-wave propagation only on one side of the metasurface either by
superposition of symmetric and asymmetric modes in the case of anisotropic
metasurfaces or by completely forbidding the existence of the surface wave on
one side of the structure using bianisotropic metasurfaces.

unsteady gust interacting with a semi-infinite flat plate with a serrated
leading edge in a background steady uniform flow. Viscous and non-linear
effects are neglected. The Wiener-Hopf method is used in conjunction with a
non-orthogonal coordinate transformation and separation of variables to permit
analytical progress. The solution is obtained in terms of a modal expansion in
the spanwise coordinate, however for low- and mid-range incident frequencies
only the zeroth order mode is seen to contribute to the far-field acoustics,
therefore the far-field noise can be quickly evaluated. The solution gives
insight into the potential mechanisms behind the reduction of noise for plates
with serrated leading edges compared to those with straight edges, and predicts
a logarithmic dependence between the tip-to-root serration height and the
decrease of far-field noise. The two mechanisms behind the noise reduction are
proposed to be an increased destructive interference in the far field, and a
redistribution of acoustic energy from low cuton modes to higher cutoff modes
as the tip-to-root serration height is increased. The analytic results show
good agreement in comparison with experimental measurements. The results are
then compared against numerical predictions for the sound generated by a
spanwise invariant line vortex interacting with a flat plate with serrated
leading edge. Good agreement is also seen between the analytical and numerical
results as frequency and tip-to-root ratio are varied.

McMaster University, we have developed both general computer literacy
activities and specific programming activities. Integration of these activities
is made easy as they each support existing curricular goals. In this paper, we
focus on programming in the functional language Elm and the graphics library
GraphicSVG. Elm is in the ML (Meta Language) family, with a lean syntax and
easy inclusion of Domain Specific Languages. This allows children to start
experimenting with GraphicSVG as a language for describing shape, and pick up
the core Elm language as they grow in sophistication. Teachers see children
making connections between computer graphics and mathematics within the first
hour. Graphics are defined declaratively, and support aggregation and
transformation, i.e., Algebra. Variables are not needed initially, but are
introduced as a time-saving feature, which is immediately accepted. Since
variables are declarative, they match students' expectations. Advanced students
are also exposed to State by making programs that react to user taps or clicks.
The syntax required to do so closely follows the theoretical concepts, making
it easy for them to grasp. For each of these concepts, we explain how they fit
into the presentations we make to students, like the 5200 children taught in
2016.
  Finally, we describe ongoing work on a touch-based Elm editor for iPad, which
features (1) type highlighting (as opposed to syntax highlighting), (2)
preservation of correct syntax and typing across transformations, (3) context
information (e.g. displaying parameter names for GraphicSVG functions), and (4)
immediate feedback (e.g. restarting animations after every program change).

  The algorithm displaces the positions of neighbor Voronoi subdomains in

Convergence to a well-balanced decomposition from imbalanced one is improved by

speckle pattern obtained at the output of the fiber and the phase or amplitude
at the input of the fiber. Effectively the network performs a non-linear
inversion task. We obtained image fidelity (correlation) of ~98% compared with
the image obtained using the measured matrix of the system. We further show
that the network can be trained for transfer learning, i.e. it can transmit

problems numerically is the non-symmetric coupling of finite elements (FEM) and
boundary elements (BEM) analyzed in [Egger, Erath, Schorr, arXiv:1711.08487,

not appropriate since FEM in general lacks conservation of numerical fluxes and
in case of convection dominance also stability.
  A possible remedy to guarantee both is the use of the vertex-centered finite
volume method (FVM) with an upwind stabilization option. Thus we propose a
(non-symmetric) coupling of FVM and BEM for a semi-discretization of the
underlying problem. For the subsequent time discretization we introduce two
options: a variant of the backward Euler method which allows us to develop an
analysis under minimal regularity assumptions and the classical backward Euler
method. We analyze both, the semi-discrete and the fully discrete system, in
terms of convergence and error estimates. Some numerical examples illustrate
the theoretical findings and give some ideas for practical applications.

present upstream and downstream of a shock then Turbulent Reconnection (TR)
will set in and will participate not only in the elastic scattering of
particles but also in their heating and acceleration. We demonstrate that large
amplitude magnetic disturbances and Unstable Current Sheets (UCS),
spontaneously formed in the strong turbulence in the vicinity of a shock, can
accelerate particles as efficiently as DSA in {\bf large scale systems and on
long time scales}. We start our analysis with ""elastic"" scatterers upstream and
downstream and estimate the energy distribution of particles escaping from the
shock, recovering the well known results from the DSA theory. Next we analyze
the additional interaction of the particles with active scatterers (magnetic
disturbances and UCS) upstream and downstream of the shock. We show that the
asymptotic energy distribution of the particles accelerated by DSA/TR has very
similar characteristics with the one due to DSA alone, but the synergy of DSA
with TR is much more efficient: The acceleration time is an order of magnitude
shorter and the maximum energy reached two orders of magnitude higher. We claim
that DSA is the dominant acceleration mechanism in a short period before TR is
established, and then strong turbulence will dominate the heating and
acceleration of the particles. In other words, the shock serves as the
mechanism to set up a strongly turbulent environment, in which the acceleration
mechanism will ultimately be the synergy of DSA and TR.

additional medium-induced radiation at a large angle from the jet axis.
However, no modification of the groomed mass of the core of the jet is observed

direct gravitational wave detections. Degeneracies among the standard model

and future surveys and to unveil the nature of dark energy. We propose various
higher-order statistics in the weak-lensing signal as a new set of observables
able to break degeneracies between massive neutrinos and MG parameters. We have
tested our methodology on so-called $f(R)$ models, which constitute a class of
viable models that can explain the accelerated universal expansion by a
modification of the fundamental gravitational interaction. We have explored a
range of these models that still fit current observations at the background and
linear level, and we show using numerical simulations that certain models which
include massive neutrinos are able to mimic $\Lambda$CDM in terms of the 3D
power spectrum of matter density fluctuations. We find that depending on the
redshift and angular scale of observation, non-Gaussian information accessed by
higher-order weak-lensing statistics can be used to break the degeneracy
between $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM. In particular, peak counts computed in
aperture mass maps outperform third- and fourth-order moments.

method in a single quantum dot and a Pauli spin blockade method in a double

photon polarization and the hole state, heavy- or light-hole, indicating a

  stabilization time and asymptotically optimal number of states",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A population protocol can be viewed as a sequence of pairwise interactions of
$n$ agents (nodes). During one interaction, two agents selected uniformly at
random update their states by applying a specified deterministic transition
function. In a long run, the whole system should stabilize at the correct
output property. The main performance objectives in designing population
protocols are small number of states per agent and fast stabilization time.
  We present a fast population protocol for the exact-majority problem which
uses $\Theta(\log n)$ states (per agent) and stabilizes in $O(\log^{5/3} n)$
parallel time (i.e., $O(n\log^{5/3} n)$ interactions) in expectation and with
high probability. Alistarh et al. [SODA 2018] showed that any exact-majority
protocol which stabilizes in expected $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ parallel time, for
any constant $\epsilon > 0$, requires $\Omega(\log n)$ states. They also showed
an $O(\log^2 n)$-time protocol with $O(\log n)$ states, the currently fastest
exact-majority protocol with polylogarithmic number of states. The standard
design framework for majority protocols is based on $O(\log n)$ phases and
requires that all nodes are well synchronized within each phase, leading
naturally to upper bounds of the order of at least $\log^2 n$ because of
$\Theta(\log n)$ synchronization time per phase. We show how this framework can
be tightened with {\em weak synchronization} to break the $O(\log^2 n)$ upper
bound of previous protocols.

a free cylindrical liquid jet coated with insoluble surfactant, extending the
results of Timmermans & Lister (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 459, 2002, pp. 289-306).
Our development requires, in particular, deriving the correct expressions for
the normal and tangential stress boundary conditions at a general axisymmetric
interface when surface viscosity is modelled with the Boussinesq-Scriven
constitutive equation. These stress conditions are applied to obtain a new
dispersion relation for the liquid thread, which is solved to describe its
temporal stability as a function of four governing parameters, namely the
capillary Reynolds number, the elasticity parameter, and the shear and
dilatational Boussinesq numbers. It is shown that both surface viscosities have
a stabilising influence for all values of the capillary Reynolds number and
elasticity parameter, the effect being more pronounced at low capillary
Reynolds numbers. The wavenumber of maximum amplification depends
non-monotonically on the Boussinesq numbers, especially for very viscous
threads at low values of the elasticity parameter. Finally, two different
lubrication approximations of the equations of motion are derived. While the
validity of the leading-order model is limited to small enough values of the
elasticity parameter and of the Boussinesq numbers, a higher-order parabolic
model is able to accurately capture the linearised behaviour for the whole
range of values of the four control parameters.

and we calculate exactly the radiation emission using first-order perturbation
theory. We compare the results obtained to that obtained via the semi-classical
method of Baier and Katkov which includes quantum effects due to photon recoil
in the radiation emission but ignores the quantum nature of the electron
motion. On the one hand, we confirm a prediction of the semi-classical method
that the emission spectrum should coincide with that in the case of a linearly
polarized monochromatic wave. On the other hand, however, we find that the
semi-classical method does not yield the exact result when the quantum number
describing the transverse motion becomes small. In this way, we address
quantitatively the problem of the limits of validity of the semi-classical

cracking under sharp contact loading compared to other oxide glasses. However,
due to the high content of hygroscopic B2O3, it is expected that applications
of these glasses could be hindered by poor chemical durability in aqueous
solutions. Indeed, the compositional and structural dependence of their
dissolution kinetics remains unexplored. In this work, we correlate the
dissolution rates of aluminoborate glasses in acidic, neutral, and basic
solutions with the structural changes induced by varying the aluminum-to-boron
ratio. In detail, we investigate a total of seventeen magnesium, lithium, and
sodium aluminoborate glasses with fixed modifier content of 25 mol%. We show
that the structural changes induced by alumina depend on the network modifier.
We also demonstrate a correlation between the chemical durability at various pH
values and the structural changes in Mg-, Li- and Na- aluminoborate glasses.
The substitution of alumina by boron oxide leads to a general decrease of
chemical corrosion in neutral and acidic solutions. The lowest dissolution rate
value is observed in Mg-aluminoborate glasses, as a consequence of the
intermediate character of magnesium which can increase the network
cross-linking. For basic solutions, the chemical durability is almost constant
for the different amount of alumina in the three series, likely because B2O3 is
susceptible to nucleophilic attack, which is favored in high-OH- solutions.

been made to build and scale such systems, it is challenging to rigorously
characterize their throughput performance at scale theoretically. What further
complicates the study is the presence of heavy-tailed delays that have been
widely documented therein. To this end, we introduce two fundamental concepts
for networks of arbitrary topology (scaling dimension and extended metric
dimension) and utilize an infinite sequence of growing FJQN/Bs to study the
throughput limit. The throughput is said to be scalable if the throughput limit
infimum of the sequence is strictly positive as the network size grows to
infinity. We investigate throughput scalability by focusing on heavy-tailed
service times that are regularly varying (with index $\alpha>1$) and featuring
the network topology described by the two aforementioned dimensions. In
particular, we show that an infinite sequence of FJQN/Bs is throughput scalable
if the extended metric dimension $<\alpha-1$ and only if the scaling dimension
$\le\alpha-1$. These theoretical results provide new insights on the
scalability of a rich class of FJQN/Bs with various structures, including

has reported widely varying channel response much of which has been attributed
to the variation in measurement setup. This calls for the development of a
unifying bio physical model of HBC supported by in depth analysis and an
understanding of the effect of excitation, termination modality on HBC
measurements. This paper characterizes the human body channel up to 1MHz
frequency to evaluate it as a medium for broadband communication. A lumped bio
physical model of HBC is developed, supported by experimental validations that
provides insight into some of the key discrepancies found in previous studies.
Voltage loss measurements are carried out both with an oscilloscope and a
miniaturized wearable prototype to capture the effects of non common ground.
Results show that the channel loss is strongly dependent on the termination
impedance at the receiver end, with up to 4dB variation in average loss for
different termination in an oscilloscope and an additional 9 dB channel loss
with wearable prototype compared to an oscilloscope measurement. The measured
channel response with capacitive termination reduces low frequency loss and
allows flat band transfer function down to 13 KHz, establishing the human body
as a broadband communication channel. Analysis of the measured results and the
simulation model shows that (1) high impedance (2) capacitive termination
should be used at the receiver end for accurate voltage mode loss measurements

disk shadowing. N2H+ and N2D+, also tracing cold gas, show low abundances

factors in determining the chemical structure of protostars as seen in gaseous

complexity out to larger distances than colder protostars, such as VLA1623.
Additionally, disks in the embedded phase have a crucial role in controlling
both the gas and dust temperature of the envelope, and consequently the

trained models. Using an inadequate test dataset, DL models that have achieved
high test accuracy may still lack generality and robustness. In traditional
software testing, mutation testing is a well-established technique for quality
evaluation of test suites, which analyzes to what extent a test suite detects

traditional software and deep learning-based software, traditional mutation
testing techniques cannot be directly applied to DL systems. In this paper, we
propose a mutation testing framework specialized for DL systems to measure the

testing in traditional software, we first define a set of source-level mutation
operators to inject faults to the source of DL (i.e., training data and
training programs). Then we design a set of model-level mutation operators that
directly inject faults into DL models without a training process. Eventually,
the quality of test data could be evaluated from the analysis on to what extent
the injected faults could be detected. The usefulness of the proposed mutation
testing techniques is demonstrated on two public datasets, namely MNIST and

individuals responding with preventive measures in an attempt to avoid getting
infected. This leads to changes in contact patterns. However, as we show in
this paper, rational behaviour at the individual level, such as social
distancing from infectious contacts, may not always be beneficial for the
population as a whole. We use epidemic network models to demonstrate the
potential negative consequences at the population level. We take into account
the social structure of the population through several network models. As the
epidemic evolves, susceptible individuals may distance themselves from their
infectious contacts. Some individuals replace their lost social connections by
seeking new ties. We show that social distancing can worsen the disease outcome
both in the initial phase of an outbreak and the final epidemic size. Moreover,
the same negative effect can arise in real-world networks. Our results suggest
that one needs to be careful when targeting behavioural changes as they could
potentially worsen the epidemic outcome. Furthermore, network structure
crucially influences the way that individual-level measures impact the epidemic
at the population level. These findings highlight the importance of careful
analysis of preventive measures in epidemic models.

using the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) by comparing the measured

independent nucleon-nucleon collisions obtained from a Glauber model. At large
transverse momenta ($8<p_{\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$), the average $R_{\rm AA}$ is
found to increase from about $0.15$ in 0-5% central to a maximum value of about
$0.8$ in 75-85% peripheral collisions, beyond which it falls off strongly to
below $0.2$ for the most peripheral collisions. Furthermore, $R_{\rm AA}$
initially exhibits a positive slope as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ in the
$8$-$20$ GeV/$c$ interval, while for collisions beyond the 80% class the slope
is negative. To reduce uncertainties related to event selection and
normalization, we also provide the ratio of $R_{\rm AA}$ in adjacent centrality
intervals. Our results in peripheral collisions are consistent with a
PYTHIA-based model without nuclear modification, demonstrating that biases
caused by the event selection and collision geometry can lead to the apparent
suppression in peripheral collisions. This explains the unintuitive observation
that $R_{\rm AA}$ is below unity in peripheral Pb-Pb, but equal to unity in

independently by rotational and mirror symmetries. We show that a particular
lattice distortion can single out the newly proposed topological protection by
the rotational symmetry. As a result, the Dirac points of the topological
surface states are moved to generic locations in momentum space away from any
high symmetry lines. Such topological surface states have not been seen before.
Moreover, the other family members, including Ca$_2$Sb, Ca$_2$Bi and Sr$_2$Sb,
feature different topological surface states due to their distinct topological

outperforms the CIMs on MAX-CUT on regular graphs of degree 3. On denser

roughly uniform, and weak emission with a size of ~0.5"", (2) a component
elongated approximately along the East-West direction peaking at ~0.13"" and
0.17"" at both sides of the central star, and (3) two blue- and red-shifted
compact components peaking around 0.07"" to the NW of the star. We have modeled
the emission with a 3D radiation transfer code finding that the observations
cannot be explained only by thermal emission. Several maser clumps and one
arc-shaped maser feature arranged from 5 to 20R* from the central star, in
addition to a thin shell-like maser structure at ~13R* are required to explain
the observations. This maser emitting set of structures accounts for 75% of the
total emission while the other 25% is produced by thermally excited molecules.
About 60% of the maser emission comes from the extended emission and the rest
from the set of clumps and the arc. The analysis of a time monitoring of these

flow $v_1$, in forward two-particle production in peripheral proton-nucleus
($pA$) collisions can arise simply from the radial nuclear profile of a large
nucleus. This requires consideration of the C-odd part of the gluonic
generalized transverse momentum dependent (GTMD) correlator of nucleons in the
nucleus. The gluonic GTMD correlator is the Fourier transform of an off-forward
hadronic matrix element containing gluonic field strength tensors that are
connected by gauge links. It is parametrized in terms of various gluon GTMD
distribution functions (GTMDs). We show (in a gauge invariant way) that for the
relevant dipole-type gauge link structure in the small-$x$ limit the GTMD
correlator reduces to a generalized Wilson loop correlator. The Wilson loop
correlator is parametrized in terms of a single function, implying that in the
region of small $x$ there is only one independent dipole-type GTMD, which can
have a C-odd part. We show that the odderon Wigner distribution, which is
related to this C-odd dipole GTMD by a Fourier transform, generates odd
harmonics in the two-particle azimuthal correlations in peripheral $pA$
collisions. We calculate the first odd harmonic $v_1$ for forward production
within the color glass condensate framework in the limit of a large number of
colors. We find that nonzero odd harmonics are present without breaking the
rotational symmetry of the nucleus, arising just from its inhomogeneity in the
radial direction. Using a CGC model with a cubic action, we illustrate that
percent level $v_1$ can arise from this C-odd mechanism. In contrast, we show
that only even harmonics arise in diffractive dijet production in
ultra-peripheral $pA$ collisions where this gluon dipole GTMD also appears.

computer to perform a task that cannot also be done by a classical computer,
typically require some sort of computational assumption related to the
limitations of classical computation. One common assumption is that the
polynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the
statement that P $\neq$ NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical
simulation of certain families of quantum circuits requires time scaling worse
than any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic nature
of this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these
quantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on
modern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational
supremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained
versions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a

input size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic
algorithm. Then, we choose a specific value of $a$ for each version that we
argue makes the assumption plausible, and based on these conjectures we
conclude that Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-Time (IQP) circuits with 208
qubits, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits with 420
qubits and boson sampling circuits (i.e. linear optical networks) with 98
photons are large enough for the task of producing samples from their output
distributions up to constant multiplicative error to be intractable on current
technology. In the first two cases, we extend this to constant additive error
by introducing an average-case fine-grained conjecture.

giving rise to a fifth force can noticeably alter dynamics on galactic scales.
Such a fifth force must be screened in the Solar System but if unscreened it
can have a similar observational effects as a component of non-baryonic matter.
We consider this possibility in the context of the vertical motions of local
stars in the Milky Way disk by reframing a methodology used to measure the
local density of dark matter. By attempting to measure the properties of the
symmetron field required to support vertical velocities we can test it as a
theory of modified gravity and understand the behaviour of screened scalar
fields in galaxies. In particular this relatively simple setup allows the
symmetron field profile to be solved for model parameters where the equation of
motion becomes highly nonlinear and difficult to solve in other contexts. We
update the existing Solar System constraints for this scenario and find a
region of parameter space not already excluded that can explain the vertical
motions of local stars out to heights of 1 kpc. At larger heights the force due
to the symmetron field profile exhibits a characteristic turn over which would
allow the model to be distinguished from a dark matter halo.

Eulerian paths on de Bruijn graphs is one of the dominant approaches to it. In
most of the cases, there may be no one order for the de Bruijn graph that works
well for assembling all of the reads. For this reason, some de Bruijn-based
assemblers try assembling on several graphs of increasing order, in turn.
Boucher et al. (2015) went further and gave a representation making it possible
to navigate in the graph and change order on the fly, up to a maximum $K$, but
they can use up to $\lg K$ extra bits per edge because they use an LCP array.
In this paper, we replace the LCP array by a succinct representation of that
array's Cartesian tree, which takes only 2 extra bits per edge and still lets
us support interesting navigation operations efficiently. These operations are
not enough to let us easily extract unitigs and only unitigs from the graph but
they do let us extract a set of safe strings that contains all unitigs. Suppose
we are navigating in a variable-order de Bruijn graph representation, following
these rules: if there are no outgoing edges then we reduce the order, hoping
one appears; if there is exactly one outgoing edge then we take it (increasing
the current order, up to $K$); if there are two or more outgoing edges then we
stop. Then we traverse a (variable-order) path such that we cross edges only
when we have no choice or, equivalently, we generate a string appending
characters only when we have no choice. It follows that the strings we extract
are safe. Our experiments show we extract a set of strings more informative
than the unitigs, while using a reasonable amount of memory.

render massive and dynamic transactions susceptible to security risks. Given
huge potential financial loss caused by vulnerabilities, existing research
lacks a comprehensive empirical study on the security risks of global banking
apps to provide useful insights and improve the security of banking apps.
  Since data-related weaknesses in banking apps are critical and may directly
cause serious financial loss, this paper first revisits the state-of-the-art
available tools and finds that they have limited capability in identifying
data-related security weaknesses of banking apps. To complement the capability
of existing tools in data-related weakness detection, we propose a three-phase
automated security risk assessment system, named AUSERA, which leverages static
program analysis techniques and sensitive keyword identification. By leveraging
AUSERA, we collect 2,157 weaknesses in 693 real-world banking apps across 83
countries, which we use as a basis to conduct a comprehensive empirical study
from different aspects, such as global distribution and weakness evolution
during version updates. We find that apps owned by subsidiary banks are always
less secure than or equivalent to those owned by parent banks. In addition, we
also track the patching of weaknesses and receive much positive feedback from
banking entities so as to improve the security of banking apps in practice. To
date, we highlight that 21 banks have confirmed the weaknesses we reported. We
also exchange insights with 7 banks, such as HSBC in UK and OCBC in Singapore,
via in-person or online meetings to help them improve their apps. We hope that
the insights developed in this paper will inform the communities about the gaps
among multiple stakeholders, including banks, academic researchers, and

translocation of biopolymers like DNA through nanopores in cells in the
presence of chaperones on the trans side of the pore. Chaperones can bind to
the polymer and prevent it from sliding back through the pore. First, we study
a simple model that describes the translocation in terms of an asymmetric
random walk. It serves as an introductory example but already captures the main
features of a Brownian ratchet. We then provide an analytical expression for
the diffusion constant in the classical model of a translocation ratchet that
was first proposed by Peskin et al. . This model is based on the assumption
that the binding and unbinding of the chaperones is much faster than the
diffusion of the DNA strand. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose a modified
model that is also applicable if the (un)binding rates are finite. We calculate
the force dependent mean velocity and diffusivity for this new model and
compare the results to the original one. Our analysis shows that for large
pulling forces the predictions of both models can differ strongly even if the
(un)binding rates are large in comparison to the diffusion time-scale but still
finite. Furthermore, implications of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation on

over its surface, and infer the major material composition of its surface
materials. In addition, the effective diameter and geometric albedo are derived
to be $D_{\rm eff}=1.13\pm0.03\rm~km$, $p_{\rm v}=0.042\pm0.003$, respectively,
and the average thermal inertia is estimated to be about $(300\pm50)\rm~J\cdot
m^{-2}\cdot s^{-0.5}\cdot K^{-1}$. According to the derived thermal inertia
distribution, we infer that the major area on the surface of the target
asteroid may be covered by loose materials, such as rock debris, sands, and so
on, but few bare rocks may exist in a very small region. In this sense, the
sample return mission of Hayabusa 2 is feasible, when it is performed
successfully, it will certainly bring significant scientific information to the
research of asteroids.

are of tremendous impact and have attracted huge amounts of research effort.
The biomedical research that seeks cures for these conditions has been
dominated by a qualitative, inductive mindset. Although the inductive approach
has not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough
information to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute
cell injury. In this work we develop a modeling approach by extending an
autonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that offered new ways
to conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its
effectiveness. Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory
using a nonautonomous formulation. Different from the standard scenario in
nonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed points of
the model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point,
the system property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding
dynamic processes. The model gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical
patterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells after clinical acute
injuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress
response capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a
theoretical explanation of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell
death after lethal injuries. The nonautonomous theory of acute cell injury
provides an improved quantitative framework for understanding cell death and
recovery and lays a foundation for developing effective therapeutics for acute
injury.

at estimating the errors caused by the specifying method used in OpenSim as
well as the influence of these errors on dynamic analysis. A 3D scan is used to
construct subject's 3D geometric model, according to which segment masses are
determined. The determined segment masses data is taken as the yardstick to
assess the errors of OpenSim scaled model. Then influence of these errors on
the dynamic calculation is evaluated in the simulation of a motion in which the
subject walks in an ordinary gait. Result shows that the mass error in one
segment can be as large as 5.31\% of overall body weight. The mean influence on
calculated joint moment varies from 0.68\% to 12.68\% in 18 joints. In
conclusion, a careful specification of segment masses will increase the
accuracy of the dynamic simulation. As far as estimating human segment masses,
the use of segment volume and density data can be an economical choice apart
from referring to population mass distribution data.

region AR12673 aroused great interest in the solar physics community. It
produced four X class flares, more than 20 CMEs and an intense geomagnetic
storm, for which the peak value of the Dst index reached up to -142nT at 2017
September 8 02:00 UT. In this work, we check the interplanetary and solar
source of this intense geomagnetic storm. We find that this geomagnetic storm
was mainly caused by a shock-ICME complex structure, which was formed by a
shock driven by the 2017 September 6 CME propagating into a previous ICME which
was the interplanetary counterpart of the 2017 September 4 CME. To better
understand the role of this structure, we conduct the quantitative analysis
about the enhancement of ICME's geoeffectiveness induced by the shock
compression. The analysis shows that the shock compression enhanced the
intensity of this geomagnetic storm by a factor of two. Without shock
compression, there would be only a moderate geomagnetic storm with a peak Dst
value of -79 nT. In addition, the analysis of the proton flux signature inside
the shock-ICME complex structure shows that this structure also enhanced the
solar energetic particles (SEPs) intensity by a factor of ~ 5. These findings
illustrate that the shock-ICME complex structure is a very important factor in
solar physics study and space weather forecast.

the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) for metal crystalline
materials from 0K to the melting point. The motion of metal atomic clusters is
decomposed into structural deformation and thermal vibration. Then thermal
vibration equations are established by the fourth-order Taylor expansion of
Hamiltonian at the transient structural deformation position
$\bar{\mathbf{x}}$. As a result, the thermal vibration frequencies dynamically
change with the structural deformation positions and temperatures. A parameter
$\bar\delta (\bar{\mathbf{x}}, T)$ is newly introduced to illustrate how the
thermal vibration frequencies vary with the temperature $T$. Besides, the
modified temperature-dependent Gr\""uneisen parameter $\bar \gamma
(\bar{\mathbf{x}}, T)$ is given. Finally, the formulae of heat capacity and TEC
for metal crystalline materials are derived from the dynamic thermal vibration
frequencies and $\bar \delta (\bar{\mathbf{x}}, T)$ as well as $\bar \gamma
(\bar{\mathbf{x}}, T)$. The numerical results of heat capacity and TEC for
metals Cu, Al, Au, Ag, Ni, Pd, Pt and Pb show a temperature dependence and
agree well with the experimental data from 0K to the melting point. This work
suggests an efficient approach to calculate thermodynamic properties of metal
materials for a wide range of temperatures, up to the melting point.

$A$ is unknown, but the set of vectors $\{A^{i-1}v_1\}_{i=1}^{N-1}$ are known.
The modified FOA is the kernel for the proposed projected DMD algorithm termed,
FOA based DMD. The proposed algorithm to compute DMD modes and eigenvalues i)
does not require Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for snapshot matrices $X$
with $\kappa_2(X) \ll 1/\epsilon_m$, where $\kappa_2(X)$ is the 2-norm
condition number of the snapshot matrix and $\epsilon_m$ is the relative
round-off error or machine epsilon, ii) has an optional rank truncation step
motivated by round off error analysis for snapshot matrices $X$ with
$\kappa_2(X) \approx 1/\epsilon_m$, iii) requires only one snapshot at a time,
thus making it a 'streaming' method even with the optional rank truncation
step, iv) consumes less memory and requires less floating point operations to
obtain the projected matrix than existing projected DMD methods and v) lends
itself to easy parallelism as the main computational kernel involves only
vector additions, dot products and matrix vector products. The new technique is
therefore well-suited for DMD of large datasets on parallel computing
platforms. We show both theoretically and using numerical examples that for FOA
based DMD without rank truncation, the finite precision error in the computed
projection of the linear mapping is $O(\epsilon_m\kappa_2(X))$. The proposed
method is also compared to existing projected DMD methods for computational
cost, memory consumption and relative round off error. Error indicators are
presented that are useful to decide when to stop acquiring new snapshots. The
proposed method is applied to several examples of numerical simulations of
fluid flow.

detailed information about the origin of this spectacular phenomena. The model
that is most commonly used to extract physical properties of the event from the
observations is the relativistic fireball model, where ejected material moving
at relativistic speeds creates a shock wave when it interacts with the
surrounding medium. Electrons are accelerated in the shock wave, generating the
observed synchrotron emission through interactions with the magnetic field in
the downstream medium. It is usually assumed that the accelerated electrons
follow a simple power-law distribution in energy between specific energy
boundaries and that no electron exists outside these boundaries. This work
explores the consequences of adding a low-energy power-law segment to the
electron distribution whose energy contributes insignificantly to the total
energy budget of the distribution. The low-energy electrons have a significant
impact on the radio emission, providing synchrotron absorption and emission at
these long wavelengths. Shorter wavelengths are affected through the
normalization of the distribution. The new model is used to analyze the light
curves of GRB 990510 and the resulting parameters compared to a model without
the extra electrons. The quality of the fit and the best fit parameters are
significantly affected by the additional model component. The new component is
in one case found to strongly affect the X-ray light curves showing how changes
to the model at radio frequencies can affect light curves at other frequencies
through changes in best fit model parameters.

The ability to control the way how data is processed is however crucial for
enterprises to guarantee (and provide evidence of) compliant processing of
critical data, as well as for users who need to control if their private data
may be analyzed or linked with additional information - a major concern in IoT
applications processing personal information. In this paper, we introduce
LUCON, a data-centric security policy framework for distributed systems that
considers data flows by controlling how messages may be routed across services
and how they are combined and processed. LUCON policies prevent information
leaks, bind data usage to obligations, and enforce data flows across services.
Policy enforcement is based on a dynamic taint analysis at runtime and an
upfront static verification of message routes against policies. We discuss the
semantics of these two complementing enforcement models and illustrate how
LUCON policies are compiled from a simple policy language into a first-order
logic representation. We demonstrate the practical application of LUCON in a
real-world IoT middleware and discuss its integration into Apache Camel.
Finally, we evaluate the runtime impact of LUCON and discuss performance and
scalability aspects.

For the face stimuli generated by a pre-trained active appearance model (AAM),
the responses of neurons in the areas of the primate brain that are responsible
for face recognition exhibit strong linear relationship with the shape
variables and appearance variables of the AAM that generates the face stimuli.
In this paper, we show that this behavior can be replicated by a deep
generative model called the generator network, which assumes that the observed
signals are generated by latent random variables via a top-down convolutional
neural network. Specifically, we learn the generator network from the face
images generated by a pre-trained AAM model using variational auto-encoder, and
we show that the inferred latent variables of the learned generator network
have strong linear relationship with the shape and appearance variables of the
AAM model that generates the face images. Unlike the AAM model that has an
explicit shape model where the shape variables generate the control points or
landmarks, the generator network has no such shape model and shape variables.
Yet the generator network can learn the shape knowledge in the sense that some
of the latent variables of the learned generator network capture the shape
variations in the face images generated by AAM.

capacity of associative memory, i.e. a large number of synchronous states

determined as the ratio of harmonics number at the common synchronization
frequency. The modelling demonstrates attainment of $N_s$ of several orders

$N_s$~260. A number of regularities are obtained, in particular, an optimal
strength of oscillator coupling is revealed when $N_s$ has a maximum. A general
tendency toward information capacity decrease is shown when the coupling
strength and switch inner noise amplitude increase. An algorithm of pattern

building. Knowledge on the best evacuation practice is commonly delivered by
traditional training approaches such as videos, posters, or evacuation drills,
but they may become ineffective in terms of knowledge acquisition and
retention. Serious games (SGs) are an innovative approach devoted to training
and educating people in a gaming environment. Recently, increasing attention
has been paid to immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based SGs for evacuation
knowledge delivery and behavior assessment because they are highly engaging and
promote greater cognitive learning.
  This paper aims to understand the development and implementation of IVR SGs
in the context of building evacuation training and research, applied to various
indoor emergencies such as fire and earthquake. Thus, a conceptual framework
for effective design and implementation through the systematic literature
review method was developed. As a result, this framework integrates critical
aspects and provides connections between them, including pedagogical and
behavioral impacts, gaming environment development, and outcome and
participation experience measures.

  and Optimal Deployment","8 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud Computing (CC) serves to be a key driver for fulfilling the store and
compute requirements of a modern Smart Grid (SG). However, since the
datacenters are deployed in concentrated and far remote areas, it fails to
guarantee the quality of experience (QoE) attributes for the SG services, viz.
latency, bandwidth, energy consumption, and network cost. Fog Computing (FC)
extends the processing capabilities into the edge of the network, offering
location-awareness, low latency, and latency-sensitive analytics for mission
critical requirements of SG. In this work, we first examine the current state
of cloud based SG architectures and highlight the motivation(s) for adopting FC
as technology enabler for sustainable and real-time SG analytics. Then we
present a hierarchical FC architecture for supporting integration of massive
number of IoT devices into future SG. Following this architecture we proposed a
cost optimization framework that jointly investigates data consumer
association, workload distribution, virtual machine placement and QoS
constraints towards viable deployment of FC model over SG networks. The
formulated MINLP problem is then solved using Modified Differential Evolution
(MDE) algorithm. Comprehensive evaluation of proposed framework on real world
parameters shows that for an infrastructure with nearly 50% applications
requesting real-time services, the overall service latency for fog computing
get reduced to almost half of that of generic cloud paradigm. It is also
observed that the fog assisted cloud framework lowers the aggregated
electricity consumption of the pure cloud computing paradigm by more than 40%.

a finite list x_1, ...., x_k of points such that each of the x_i, as a function
of x, is a measure preserving transformation. We ask two questions about a
colouring rule (1) does there exist a finitely additive extension of the
probability measure for which the x_i remain measure preserving and also a
colouring obeying the rule almost everywhere that is measurable with respect to
this extension?, and (2) does there exist any colouring obeying the rule almost
everywhere? if the answer to the first question is no and to the second
question yes, we say that the colouring rule is paradoxical. A paradoxical
colouring rule not only allows for a paradoxical partition of the space, it
requires one. We pay special attention to generalizations of the Hausdorff
paradox.

beams on a compact platform. Infrared nanophotonic devices are widely used in
data communications to overcome traditional bandwidth limitations of electrical
interconnects. Nanophotonic devices also hold promise for use in biological
applications that require visible light, but this has remained technically
elusive due to the challenges of reconfiguring and guiding light at these
smaller dimensions. In neuroscience, for example, there is a need for
implantable optical devices to optogenetically stimulate neurons across deep
brain regions with the speed and precision matching state-of-the-art recording
probes. Here we demonstrate the first platform for reconfigurable nanophotonic
devices in the visible wavelength range and show its application in vivo in the
brain. We demonstrate an implantable probe endowed with the ability to rapidly
switch and route multiple optical beams using a nanoscale switching network.
Each switch consists of a silicon nitride waveguide structure that can be
reconfigured by electrically tuning the phase of light and is designed for
robustness to fabrication variation, enabling scalable devices. By implanting
our probe in mouse visual cortex, we demonstrate in vivo the ability to
stimulate identified sets of neurons across layers to produce multi-neuron
spike patterns and record them simultaneously with sub-millisecond temporal
precision. This nanophotonic platform can be scaled up and integrated with
high-density neural recording technologies, opening the door to implantable
probe technologies that are able to simultaneously record and stimulate the
activity of large neural populations at distant regions of the brain with
sub-millisecond precision. We expect this platform will enable researchers to
gain a deeper understanding into the spatio-temporal precision of the neural
code.

optical and magnetic properties. However, they cannot be as efficiently doped
as silicon or gallium arsenide, which limits their practical applicability.
Here, we report a superinjection effect in diamond p-i-n diodes, which gives
the possibility to inject orders of magnitude more electrons into the i-region
of the diode than the doping of the n-type injection layer allows. Moreover, we
show that the efficiency of electron injection can be further improved using an
i-p grating implemented in the i-region. The predicted superinjection effect
enables to overcome fundamental limitations related to the high activation
energy of donors in diamond and gives the possibility to design
high-performance devices.
