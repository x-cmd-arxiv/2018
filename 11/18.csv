  distances","41 pages, 9 figures, some prelimiary results presented at SIS 2018",,,,"stat.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The paper deals with a Batch Self Organizing Map algorithm (DBSOM) for data
described by distributional-valued variables. This kind of variables is
characterized to take as values one-dimensional probability or frequency
distributions on a numeric support. The objective function optimized in the
algorithm depends on the choice of the distance measure. According to the
nature of the date, the $L_2$ Wasserstein distance is proposed as one of the
most suitable metrics to compare distributions. It is widely used in several
contexts of analysis of distributional data. Conventional batch SOM algorithms
consider that all variables are equally important for the training of the SOM.
However, it is well known that some variables are less relevant than others for
this task. In order to take into account the different contribution of the
variables we propose an adaptive version of the DBSOM algorithm that tackles
this problem with an additional step: a relevance weight is automatically
learned for each distributional-valued variable. Moreover, since the $L_2$
Wasserstein distance allows a decomposition into two components: one related to
the means and one related to the size and shape of the distributions, also
relevance weights are automatically learned for each of the measurement
components to emphasize the importance of the different estimated parameters of
the distributions. Examples of real and synthetic datasets of distributional
data illustrate the usefulness of the proposed DBSOM algorithms.

hydrothermal fields of moderately active volcanoes have an unpredictable and
hazardous behavior that may endanger human beings. Steam blasts can expel
devastating ejecta and create craters of several tens of meters. The management
of such hydrothermal hazards in populated areas is problematic because of their
very short time constants. At present no precursory signal is clearly
identified as a potential warning of imminent danger. Here we show how the
combination of seismic noise monitoring and muon density tomography allows to
detect, with an unprecedented space and time resolution, the increase of
activity of a hydrothermal focus located 50 to 100 m below the summit of an
active volcano, the La Soufri\`ere of Guadeloupe, in the Lesser Antilles. The
present study deals with hydrothermal activity events at timescales of few
hours to few days. We show how the combination of those two methods improves
the risk evaluation of short-term hazards and the localization of the involved

various sensors including temperature probes, seismic antennas and cosmic muon
telescopes around such volcanoes could valuably contribute to early warning

spin-dependent many body ground state correlation energy. Because the tunneling
process is spin-conserving, the 2D (two-dimensional) to 2D tunneling current
$I$ at a given bias voltage $V$ in a spin-polarized system is a sum of majority
and minority spin contributions. The sum rules can be used to define
spin-dependent gaps that we associate with peaks in 2D to 2D tunneling $I-V$
curves. We discuss different scenarios of tunneling between layers at different
fillings in relation to our sum rules. We comment on what recent tunneling
experiments say about spin-dependent correlations in light of our sum rules,
and propose additional measurements that could provide more specific
experimental estimates of spin-dependent correlation energies.

we present an inherently discrete physical model of light propagation that
naturally forms a causal space-time scattering network (STSN). STSN has the

readily implemented in a variety of software and hardware that are optimized
for deep learning. Also, STSN inherently includes the physics of light

We show this property leads to orders of magnitude smaller number of unknown
weights, and a much faster convergence, compared with inverse design methods

complexity of the problem precludes formulation of a unifying and commonly

framework of a multi-agent reinforcement learning model. When the network of
interactions between agents is a complete graph or a sufficiently dense random
graph, a global consensus is typically reached with the emerging language being
a nearly unique object-word mapping or containing some synonyms and homonyms.
On finite-dimensional lattices, the model gets trapped in disordered
configurations with a local consensus only. Such a trapping can be avoided by
introducing a population renewal, which in the presence of superlinear
reinforcement restores an ordinary surface-tension driven coarsening and
considerably enhances formation of efficient signaling.

Specifically, we estimate the probability of the event that the property is

verification framework in that when the property can be violated, it provides
an informative notion of how robust the network is, rather than just the
conventional assertion that the network is not verifiable. Furthermore, it
provides an ability to scale to larger networks than formal verification
approaches. Though the framework still provides a formal guarantee of
satisfiability whenever it successfully finds one or more violations, these
advantages do come at the cost of only providing a statistical estimate of
unsatisfiability whenever no violation is found. Key to the practical success
of our approach is an adaptation of multi-level splitting, a Monte Carlo
approach for estimating the probability of rare events, to our statistical
robustness framework. We demonstrate that our approach is able to emulate
formal verification procedures on benchmark problems, while scaling to larger
networks and providing reliable additional information in the form of accurate
estimates of the violation probability.

adversarial examples that effectively fool those same deep learning models. We
demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that the robustness of deep
sparse coding models to adversarial examples arises from two key properties.
First, because deep sparse coding models learn general features corresponding
to generators of the dataset as a whole, rather than highly discriminative
features for distinguishing specific classes, the resulting classifiers are
less dependent on idiosyncratic features that might be more easily exploited.
Second, because deep sparse coding models utilize fixed point attractor
dynamics with top-down feedback, it is more difficult to find small changes to
the input that drive the resulting representations out of the correct attractor
basin.

a factor of proportionality, then from the current prices of power-payoff

rare social Q&A sites that allow users to explicitly post anonymous questions
and such activity in this forum has become normative rather than a taboo.
Through an analysis of 5.1 million questions, we observe that at a global scale
almost no difference manifests between the linguistic structure of the
anonymous and the non-anonymous questions. We find that topical mixing at the
global scale to be the primary reason for the absence. However, the differences
start to feature once we ""deep dive"" and (topically) cluster the questions and
compare the clusters that have high volumes of anonymous questions with those
that have low volumes of anonymous questions. In particular, we observe that
the choice to post the question as anonymous is dependent on the user's
perception of anonymity and they often choose to speak about depression,
anxiety, social ties and personal issues under the guise of anonymity. We
further perform personality trait analysis and observe that the anonymous group
of users has positive correlation with extraversion, agreeableness, and
negative correlation with openness. Subsequently, to gain further insights, we
build an anonymity grid to identify the differences in the perception on
anonymity of the user posting the question and the community of users answering
it. We also look into the first response time of the questions and observe that
it is lowest for topics which talk about personal and sensitive issues, which
hints toward a higher degree of community support and user engagement.

solutions is one way to incorporate IL in PEM. In addition to quantifying the
IL uptake in PEM, physical characterization of the swollen PEM is essential for
their potential applications and to uncover the underlying molecular process of
the swelling. In this article, thickness and viscoelasticity of
PEI(PSS/PADMAC)4PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)4PSS multilayers were determined upon
uptake of aqueous solutions of 1-Ethyl-3methylimidazolium chloride, a
water-soluble IL. This was done by employing the Kelvin-Voigt model in
combination with the frequency and dissipation shifts measured using quartz
crystal microbalance with dissipation technique. The modeled thickness and
viscoelasticity of the multilayers change in two phases with increasing IL
concentration. In the first phase, a small increase in PEM thickness
accompanies a two to three-fold increase in PEM viscoelasticity, whereas the
changes are other ways around in the second phase. Two phenomenon contributes
to the two-phase changes: 1) the exchange between hydrated ions of IL and
in-situ water of PEM influencing the overall ion and water content in PEM and
2) the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between incorporated IL and
PEM influencing the structural integrity of PEM.

not one but multiple instances of a planning domain. Recently, it has been
shown that generalized plans can be expressed as mappings of feature values
into actions, and that they can often be computed with fully observable
non-deterministic (FOND) planners. The actions in such plans, however, are not
the actions in the instances themselves, which are not necessarily common to
other instances, but abstract actions that are defined on a set of common
features. The formulation assumes that the features and the abstract actions
are given. In this work, we address this limitation by showing how to learn
them automatically. The resulting account of generalized planning combines
learning and planning in a novel way: a learner, based on a Max SAT
formulation, yields the features and abstract actions from sampled state
transitions, and a FOND planner uses this information, suitably transformed, to
produce the general plans. Correctness guarantees are given and experimental

covariate-adaptive randomization has been used in survival analysis for a long

practitioners would simply adopt a conventional test such as the log-rank test

derived under simple randomization may not be valid under other randomization
schemes. In this article, we prove that the log-rank test valid under simple
randomization is conservative in terms of type I error under covariate-adaptive

is no longer robust under covariate-adaptive randomization. We then propose a

function performed by code, as it can benefit the software maintenance, code
categorization and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, most
state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework which encodes
the code into a hidden space and then decode it into natural language space,
suffering from two major drawbacks: a) Their encoders only consider the
sequential content of code, ignoring the tree structure which is also critical
for the task of code summarization, b) Their decoders are typically trained to
predict the next word by maximizing the likelihood of next ground-truth word
with previous ground-truth word given. However, it is expected to generate the
entire sequence from scratch at test time. This discrepancy can cause an
\textit{exposure bias} issue, making the learnt decoder suboptimal. In this
paper, we incorporate an abstract syntax tree structure as well as sequential
content of code snippets into a deep reinforcement learning framework (i.e.,
actor-critic network). The actor network provides the confidence of predicting
the next word according to current state. On the other hand, the critic network
evaluates the reward value of all possible extensions of the current state and
can provide global guidance for explorations. We employ an advantage reward
composed of BLEU metric to train both networks. Comprehensive experiments on a
real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed model when compared

an elegant model that is able to capture the balance between quality and
diversity within sets. DPPs are parameterized by a positive semi-definite
kernel matrix. While DPPs have substantial expressive power, they are
fundamentally limited by the parameterization of the kernel matrix and their
inability to capture nonlinear interactions between items within sets. We
present the deep DPP model as way to address these limitations, by using a deep
feed-forward neural network to learn the kernel matrix. In addition to allowing
us to capture nonlinear item interactions, the deep DPP also allows easy
incorporation of item metadata into DPP learning. Since the learning target is
the DPP kernel matrix, the deep DPP allows us to use existing DPP algorithms
for efficient learning, sampling, and prediction. Through an evaluation on
several real-world datasets, we show experimentally that the deep DPP can
provide a considerable improvement in the predictive performance of DPPs, while
also outperforming strong baseline models in many cases.

are irregular and unordered, hence applying convolution on them can be

operation, named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build
deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear
functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density
functions. With respect to a given point, the weight functions are learned with
multi-layer perceptron networks and density functions through kernel density
estimation. The most important contribution of this work is a novel
reformulation proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions, which
allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its
performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute
translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in
the 3D space. Besides, PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to
propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original
resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanNet show that deep
convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve
state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point

that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional

hadrons can be quantitatively characterized, among others, using a basis of
universal non-perturbative functions: parton distribution functions (PDFs),
generalized parton distributions (GPDs), transverse-momentum dependent
distributions (TMDs) and distribution amplitudes (DAs). For more than half a
century, there has been a joint experimental and theoretical effort to obtain
these partonic functions. However, the complexity of the strong interactions
has placed severe limitations, and first-principle results on the distributions
was extracted mostly from their moments computed in Lattice QCD. Recently,
breakthrough ideas changed the landscape and several approaches were proposed
to access the distributions themselves on the lattice.
  In this paper, we review in considerable detail approaches directly related
to partonic distributions. We highlight a recent idea proposed by X. Ji on
extracting quasi-distributions that spawned renewed interest in the whole field
and sparked the largest amount of numerical studies of Lattice QCD. We discuss
theoretical and practical developments, including challenges that had to be
overcome, with some yet to be handled. We also review numerical results,
including a discussion based on evolving understanding of the underlying
concepts and theoretical and practical progress. Particular attention is given
to important aspects that validated the quasi-distribution approach, such as
renormalization, matching to light-cone distributions and lattice techniques.
  In addition to a thorough discussion of quasi-distributions, we consider
other approaches: hadronic tensor, auxiliary quark methods, pseudo-PDFs, OPE
without OPE and good lattice cross sections. In closing, we provide prospects
of the field, with emphasis on the necessary conditions to obtain results with
controlled uncertainties.

illuminate the eye from two different directions. Each iris image in the pair
is captured under near-infrared illumination at a different angle relative to
the eye. Photometric stereo is used to estimate surface normal vectors in the
non-occluded portions of the iris region. The variability of the normal vectors
is used as the presentation attack detection score. This score is larger for a
texture that is irregularly opaque and printed on a convex contact lens, and is
smaller for an authentic iris texture. Thus the problem is formulated as binary
classification into (a) an eye wearing textured contact lens and (b) the
texture of an actual iris surface (possibly seen through a clear contact lens).
Experiments were carried out on a database of approx. 2,900 iris image pairs

over 98% of samples when the contact lens brand was seen during training. The

assumptions, yet has marked effects on the dynamics in evolutionary games. One
particularly important aspect is whether or not competitors also interact.
Population structures naturally affect sampling such that in a microscopic
interpretation of the replicator dynamics in well-mixed populations competing
individuals do not interact but do interact in structured populations. In
social dilemmas interactions with competitors invariably inhibit cooperation
while limited local interactions in structured populations support cooperation
by reducing exploitation through cluster formation. These antagonistic effects
of population structures on cooperation affect interpretations and the
conclusions depend on the details of the comparison. For example, in the
Snowdrift game, spatial structure may inhibit cooperation when compared to the
replicator dynamics. However, modifying the replicator dynamics to include
interactions between competitors lowers the equilibrium frequency of
cooperators, which changes the conclusions and space is invariably beneficial,
just as in the Prisoner's Dilemma. These conclusions are confirmed by
comparisons with random matching models, which mimic population structures but
randomly reshuffle individuals to inhibit spatial correlations. Finally, the
differences in the dynamics with and without interactions among competing
individuals underlies the differences between death-birth and birth-death
updating in the spatial Moran process: death-birth supports cooperation because
competitors tend not to interact whereas they tend to do for birth-death
updating and hence cooperators provide direct support to competitors to their
own detriment.

in their plane wave expansions have positive helicity, thereby determine a
subspace of phase space. We will show that this subspace consists of initial
gauge potentials which lie in the positive spectral subspace of the operator
curl together with initial electric fields conjugate to such potentials.
Similarly for negative helicity. Helicity is thereby characterized by the
spectral subspaces of curl in configuration space. A gauge potential on
three-space has a Poisson extension to a four dimensional Euclidean half space,
defined as the solution to the Maxwell-Poisson equation whose initial data is
the given gauge potential. We will show that the extension is anti-self dual if

Similarly for self dual extension and negative spectral subspace. Helicity is
thereby characterized for a normalizable electromagnetic field by the canonical
formalism and (anti-)self duality.
  For a non-abelian gauge field on Minkowski space a plane wave expansion is
not gauge invariant. Nor is the notion of positive spectral subspace of curl.
But if one replaces the Maxwell-Poisson equation by the Yang-Mills-Poisson
equation then (anti-)self duality on the Euclidean side induces a decomposition
of (now non-linear) configuration space similar to that in the electromagnetic

properties. To probe this hypothesis, in situ transmission electron microscopy
fatigue cycling is performed on Cu-1 at.% Zr thin films thermally treated to
have either only ordered grain boundaries or to contain amorphous intergranular
films. The sample with only ordered grain boundaries experienced grain
coarsening at crack initiation followed by unsteady crack propagation and
extensive nanocracking, whereas the sample containing amorphous intergranular
films had no grain coarsening at crack initiation followed by steady crack
propagation and distributed plastic activity. Microstructural design for
control of these behaviors through simple thermal treatments can allow for the
improvement of nanocrystalline metal fatigue toughness.

the scaled Hipparcos-Gaia DR2 positional differences and the Hipparcos proper

The catalog is constructed with an eye toward completeness; it contains nearly
98\% of the Hipparcos stars. It also includes a handful of spurious entries and
a few stars with poor Hipparcos reductions that the user must vet by hand.

liquids on a completely wettable spherical substrate is theoretically studied.
Both convex spherical substrates and concave spherical cavities with smooth or
rough surfaces are considered. The droplet on a rough substrate is modeled by
either the Wenzel or the Cassie-Baxter model. The two sources of driving force
of spreading by the surface-tension and the line tension are considered. Also,
the two channels of energy dissipation by the viscous dissipation within the
bulk and the frictional dissipation at the contact line are considered. A
combined theory of spreading on a spherical substrate is constructed by
including those four factors. The spreading process is divided into four
stages, each of which is governed by one of two driving forces and one of two
dissipations. It is found that the dynamic contact angle $\theta$ has a
characteristic time ($t$) dependence at each stage. It does not necessarily
follow the standard power law $\theta \sim t^{-\alpha}$. Instead, the
relaxation can be a power-law with the exponent $\alpha$ different from that on
a flat substrate, or it can be exponential or it can finish within a finite
time. Therefore, various spreading scenarios on a spherical substrate and in a
spherical cavity are predicted.

of the host stars' ages. Two of our objects, HD 4747B and HR 7672B, already
have precise dynamical masses near the stellar/substellar boundary and are used
to validate our approach. For Gl 758B, we obtain a mass of
$m=38.1_{-1.5}^{+1.7}$ $M_{Jup}$, the most precise mass measurement of this
companion to date. Gl 758B is the coldest brown dwarf with a dynamical mass,
and the combination of our low mass and slightly older host-star age resolves
its previously noted discrepancy with substellar evolutionary models. HD
68017B, a late-M dwarf, has a mass of $m=0.147\pm 0.003$ $M_\odot$, consistent
with stellar theory and previous empirical estimates based on its absolute
magnitude. The progenitor of the white dwarf Gl 86B has been debated in the
literature, and our dynamical measurement of $m=0.595 \pm 0.010$ $M_\odot$ is
consistent with a higher progenitor mass and younger age for this
planet-hosting binary system. Overall, these case studies represent only five
of the thousands of accelerating systems identified by combining Hipparcos and
Gaia. Our analysis could be repeated for many of them to build a large sample

corrections to its spectral properties included, plays an essential role for
the description of the scalar susceptibility $\chi_S$, signaling chiral
symmetry restoration. First, we use the $O(4)$ Linear Sigma Model as a testbed
to derive the connection between $\chi_S$ and the $\sigma$ propagator and to
check the validity and reliability of the approach where $\chi_S$ is saturated
by the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ inverse self-energy, which we calculate at finite $T$
to one loop. A more accurate phenomenological description is achieved by
considering the saturation approach as given by the thermal $f_0(500)$ state
generated in Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory. Such approach allows to
describe fairly well recent lattice data within the uncertainty range given by
the UChPT parameters. Finally, we compare the UChPT saturated description with
one based on the Hadron Resonance Gas, for which the hadron mass dependences
are extracted from recent theoretical analysis. Several fits to lattice data
are performed, which confirm the validity of the thermal $f_0(500)$ saturated
approach and hence the importance of that thermal state for chiral symmetry
restoration.

interested in designing a higher-order uncertainty metric for deep neural

assumes there exists an underlying higher-order distribution $\mathbb{P}(z)$,
which controls label-wise categorical distribution $\mathbb{P}(y)$ over classes
on the K-dimension simplex, and then approximate such higher-order distribution
via parameterized posterior function $p_{\theta}(z|x)$ under variational
inference framework, finally we use the entropy of learned posterior
distribution $p_{\theta}(z|x)$ as uncertainty measure to detect
out-of-distribution examples. Further, we propose an auxiliary objective
function to discriminate against synthesized adversarial examples to further
increase the robustness of the proposed uncertainty measure. Through
comprehensive experiments on various datasets, our proposed framework is
demonstrated to consistently outperform competing algorithms.

the highest degree of ballisticity from both single-walled and double-walled

single-walled Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor has been considered and
the diameter dependence on degree of ballisticity has been simulated. The
effects of drain voltage, gate voltage and channel length have been
investigated for such characteristics followed by a comparison with
double-walled CNT-FET structure. First of all, it has been found that degree of
ballisticity along with the optimum diameter increases with the increase of
(VDS VGS). The increase of channel length, however, degrades the ballistic
performance demanding a higher diameter to reach the optimum point. Finally, it
can be concluded that optimum diameter for DWCNT-FET reaches earlier than
SWCNT-FET but at lower degree of ballisticity.

its nodes, that is, a matching-$k$-cover? A first, easy polynomial solution
from matroid union is possible, as already observed by Wang, Song and Yuan
(Mathematical Programming, 2014). However, it was not satisfactory neither from
the algorithmic viewpoint nor for proving graphic theorems, since the
corresponding matroid ignores the edges of the graph.
  We prove here, simply and algorithmically: all nodes of a graph can be
covered with $k\ge 2$ matchings if and only if for every stable set $S$ we have
$|S|\le k\cdot|N(S)|$. When $k=1$, an exception occurs: this condition is not
enough to guarantee the existence of a matching-$1$-cover, that is, the
existence of a perfect matching, in this case Tutte's famous matching theorem
(J. London Math. Soc., 1947) provides the right `good' characterization. The
condition above then guarantees only that a perfect $2$-matching exists, as
known from another theorem of Tutte (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 1953).
  Some results are then deduced as consequences with surprisingly simple
proofs, using only the level of difficulty of bipartite matchings. We give some
generalizations, as well as a solution for minimization if the edge-weights are
non-negative, while the edge-cardinality maximization of matching-$2$-covers
turns out to be already NP-hard.
  We have arrived at this problem as the line graph special case of a model
arising for manufacturing integrated circuits with the technology called
`Directed Self Assembly'.

waves have been explored on curved surfaces. Here we consider Wolf effect, a
phenomenon of spectral shift due to the fluctuating nature of light fields, on
an arbitrary surface of revolution (SOR). The general expression of the
propagation of partially coherent beams propagating on arbitrary SOR is derived
and the corresponding evolution of light spectrum is also obtained. We
investigate the extra influence of surface topology on spectral shift by
defining two quantities, effective propagation distance and effective
transverse distance, and compare them with longitudinal and transverse proper
lengths. Spectral shift is accelerated when the defined effective quantities
are greater than real proper lengths, and vice versa. We also employ some
typical SORs, cylindrical surfaces, conical surfaces, SORs generated by power
function and periodic peanut-shell shapes, as examples to provide concrete
analyses. This work generalizes the research of Wolf effect to arbitrary SORs,
and provides a universal method for analyzing properties of propagation

healthcare without affecting the detection of critical events in the biomedical

effectively the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and to achieve low bit error

wide bandwidth to be transmitted in the practical channel, which is difficult
for the practical transducer or antenna to convert such a broad band signal. To
solve this problem, in this work, the chaotic signal is applied to a radio-wave
communication system, and the corresponding coding and decoding algorithms are
proposed. A hybrid chaotic system is used as the pulse-shaping filter to obtain
the baseband signal, and the corresponding matched filter is used at the
receiver, instead of the conventional low-pass filter, to maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio. At the same time, the symbol judgment threshold
determined by the chaos property is used to reduce the Inter-Symbol
Interference (ISI) effect. Simulations and virtual channel experiments show

isotope scattering has only a small effect on thermal conduction in MoS$_2$ and
the in-plane thermal conductivity decreases with increasing layer number and
saturates beyond about three layers. We identify the REBO potential as a
transferable empirical potential for MD simulations of MoS$_2$ which can be

discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform and discrete wavelet
transform. Due to the nonlinearity of these transformations, $\mathcal{L}$-MLDS
is able to capture the nonlinear correlations within the data unlike the MLDS

a node's final opinion in the first phase acts as its initial biased opinion in
the second phase. In this setting, we study the problem of two camps aiming to
maximize adoption of their respective opinions, by strategically investing on
nodes in the two phases. A node's initial opinion in the second phase naturally
plays a key role in determining the final opinion of that node, and hence also
of other nodes in the network due to its influence on them. More importantly,
this bias also determines the effectiveness of a camp's investment on that node
in the second phase. To formalize this two-phase investment setting, we propose
an extension of Friedkin-Johnsen model, and hence formulate the utility
functions of the camps. There is a tradeoff while splitting the budget between
the two phases. A lower investment in the first phase results in worse initial
biases for the second phase, while a higher investment spares a lower available
budget for the second phase. We first analyze the non-competitive case where
only one camp invests, for which we present a polynomial time algorithm for
determining an optimal way to split the camp's budget between the two phases.
We then analyze the case of competing camps, where we show the existence of
Nash equilibrium and that it can be computed in polynomial time under
reasonable assumptions. We conclude our study with simulations on real-world
network datasets, in order to quantify the effects of the initial biases and
the weightage attributed by nodes to their initial biases, as well as that of a
camp deviating from its equilibrium strategy. Our main conclusion is that, if
nodes attribute high weightage to their initial biases, it is advantageous to
have a high investment in the first phase, so as to effectively influence the
biases to be harnessed in the second phase.

schemes, so-called $\mathrm{P}_{n}\mathrm{T}_{m}-\mathrm{BVD}$ (polynomial of
$n$-degree and THINC function of $m$-level reconstruction based on BVD
algorithm), are designed by employing high-order linear-weight polynomials and
THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) functions with adaptive
steepness as the reconstruction candidates. The final reconstruction function
in each cell is determined with a multi-stage BVD (Boundary Variation
Diminishing) algorithm so as to effectively control numerical oscillation and
dissipation. We devise the new schemes up to eleventh order in an efficient way
by directly increasing the order of the underlying upwind scheme using
linear-weight polynomials. The analysis of the spectral property and accuracy
tests show that the new reconstruction strategy well preserves the
low-dissipation property of the underlying upwind schemes with high-order
linear-weight polynomials for smooth solution over all wave numbers and
realizes $n+1$ order convergence rate. The performance of new schemes is
examined through widely used benchmark tests, which demonstrate that the
proposed schemes are capable of simultaneously resolving small-scale flow
features with high resolution and capturing discontinuities with low
dissipation. With outperforming results and simplicity in algorithm, the new
reconstruction strategy shows great potential as an alternative numerical
framework for computing nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that have
discontinuous and smooth solutions of different scales.

however, that this mechanism is usually considered separately for photon and
graviton, though in reality they appear in fact together. In this connection,
we recently develop the common emergent electrogravity model which would like
to present here. This model incorporates the ordinary QED and tensor field
gravity mimicking linearized general relativity. The SLIV is induced by
length-fixing constraints put on the vector and tensor fields, $A_{\mu

symmetry then the model Lagrangian itself. As a result, the twelve Goldstone
modes are produced in total and they are collected into the vector and tensor
field multiplets. While photon is always the true vector Goldstone boson,
graviton contain pseudo-Goldstone modes as well. In terms of the appearing zero
modes, theory becomes essentially nonlinear and contains many Lorentz and CPT

and continental margin environments using R programming language and
mathematical algorithms of correlation methods written on R code. To record the
system of geological, tectonic, geographic, oceanological and bathymetric

which factors are the most influencing for the Mariana trench morphology, and
to what extend do they affect its development? Is sedimental thickness of the
ocean trench basement more important factors for the trench formation comparing
to the steepness slope angle and aspect degree? Three methods of computing were
tested: Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Kendall correlation,
numerical correlogram, correlation matrix and cross-correlatios to analyze
environmental impact factors. The correlogram matrices are computed and
visualized by R scripting libraries. Complex usage of programming tools,
mathematical statistics and geospatial analysis enabled to get a differentiated

revealed following three types of factors having the highest score: geometric

of four fundamental interactions, which are relevant to the classical mechanics
and quantum mechanics, in the curved spaces. J. C. Maxwell was the first to
utilize the quaternions to describe the property of electromagnetic fields.
Nowadays the scholars introduce the complex-octonions to depict the
electromagnetic and gravitational fields. And the complex-sedenions can be
applied to study the field equations of the four interactions in the classical
mechanics and quantum mechanics. Further, it is able to extend the field
equations from the flat space into the curved space described with the
complex-sedenions, by means of the tangent-frames and tensors. The research
states that a few physical quantities will make a contribution to certain
spatial parameters of the curved spaces. These spatial parameters may exert an
influence on some operators (such as, divergence, gradient, and curl),
impacting the field equations in the curved spaces, especially the field
equations of the four quantum-fields in the quantum mechanics. Apparently the
paper and General Relativity both confirm and succeed to the Cartesian academic
thought of `the space is the extension of substance'.

  Australian Parliament in 2016",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After the 2016 double dissolution election, the 45th Australian Parliament
was formed. At the time of its swearing in, the Senate of the 45th Australian
Parliament consisted of nine political parties, the largest number in the
history of the Australian Parliament. Due to the breadth of the political
spectrum that the Senate represented, the situation presented an interesting
opportunity for the study of political interactions in the Australian context.
Using publicly available Senate voting data in 2016, we quantitatively analyzed
two aspects of the Senate. Firstly, we analyzed the degree to which each of the
non-government parties of the Senate are pro- or anti-government. Secondly, we
analyzed the degree to which the votes of each of the non-government Senate
parties are in concordance or discordance with one another. We utilized the
fully-visible Boltzmann machine (FVBM) model in order to conduct these
analyses. The FVBM is an artificial neural network that can be viewed as a
multivariate generalization of the Bernoulli distribution. Via a maximum
pseudolikelihood estimation approach, we conducted parameter estimation and
constructed hypotheses test that revealed the interaction structures within the
Australian Senate. The conclusions that we drew are well-supported by external
sources of information.
