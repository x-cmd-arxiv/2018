an $L^2$-normalized sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions, $-\Delta_g\phi_\lambda
=\lambda^2 \phi_\lambda$. Given a smooth submanifold $H \subset M$ of
codimension $k\geq 1$, we find conditions on the pair $(M,H)$, even when
$H=\{x\}$, for which $$ \Big|\int_H\phi_\lambda
d\sigma_H\Big|=O\Big(\frac{\lambda^{\frac{k-1}{2}}}{\sqrt{\log

conditions require no global assumption on the manifold $M$ and instead relate
to the structure of the set of recurrent directions in the unit normal bundle
to $H$. Our results extend all previously known conditions guaranteeing
improvements on averages, including those on sup-norms. For example, we show
that if $(M,g)$ is a surface with Anosov geodesic flow, then there are
logarithmically improved averages for any $H\subset M$. We also find weaker
conditions than having no conjugate points which guarantee $\sqrt{\log

are obtained using geodesic beam techniques, which yield a mechanism for
obtaining general quantitative improvements for averages and sup-norms.

assumption in theoretical and computational neuroscience. Specific
computational models, anchored in biophysics, for generating different types of
network dynamics, and with a relation to psychiatric symptoms, will be briefly
reviewed, as well as methodological approaches for reconstructing the system
dynamics from observed time series (like fMRI or EEG recordings). We then
attempt to outline how psychiatric phenomena, associated with schizophrenia,
depression, PTSD, ADHD, phantom pain, and others, could be understood in
dynamical systems terms. Most importantly, we will try to convey that the
dynamical systems level may provide a central, hub-like level of convergence
which unifies and links multiple biophysical and behavioral phenomena, in the
sense that diverse biophysical changes can give rise to the same dynamical
phenomena and, vice versa, similar changes in dynamics may yield different
behavioral symptoms depending on the brain area where these changes manifest.
If this assessment is correct, it may have profound implications for the
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of psychiatric conditions, as it puts the
focus on dynamics. We therefore argue that consideration of dynamics should
play an important role in the choice and target of interventions.

using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. One of the aims is to compare our
results with those from Korsaga et al. (2018), which used mid-infrared (MIR)
WISE W1 (3.4 $\mu$m) photometric data. For the analysis, the same tools were
used for both bands. Pseudo-Isothermal (ISO) core and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
cuspy models have been used. We test Best Fit Models (BFM), Maximum Disc Models
(MDM) and models for which M/L is fixed using the B - V colors. Similarly to
what was found in the MIR 3.4 $\mu$m band, most of the observed rotation curves
are better described by a central core density profile (ISO) than a cuspy one
(NFW) when using the optical R$_c$-band. In both bands, the dispersion in the
(M/L) values is smaller for the fixed M/L fits. As for the W1 photometry, the
derived DM halos' parameters depend on the morphological types. We find similar
relations than those in the literature, only when we compare our results for
the bulge-poor sub-sample because most of previous results were mainly based on
late-type spirals. Because the dispersion in the model parameters is smaller
and because stellar masses are better defined in that band, MIR photometry
should be preferred, when possible, to the optical bands. It is shown that for
high-z galaxies, sensible results can still be obtained without full profile
decomposition.

requires understanding implicit relations, which humans resolve via external,

that uses a multi-attention mechanism to perform multiple hops of reasoning and
a pointer-generator decoder to synthesize the answer. This model performs
substantially better than previous generative models, and is competitive with
current state-of-the-art span prediction models. We next introduce a novel
system for selecting grounded multi-hop relational commonsense information from
ConceptNet via a pointwise mutual information and term-frequency based scoring
function. Finally, we effectively use this extracted commonsense information to
fill in gaps of reasoning between context hops, using a selectively-gated
attention mechanism. This boosts the model's performance significantly (also
verified via human evaluation), establishing a new state-of-the-art for the

molecular-level experimental observations of the catalytic process are scarce,
and most existing catalysts tend to rely on empirically optimized, expensive

catalyze methanol from volatile organic compounds in ambient conditions. Using
single-molecule resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid, we directly
observe the formation and evolution of methanol-water nanostructures at the
surface of graphite. These molecularly ordered structures nucleate near
catalytically active surface features such as atomic step edges and grow
progressively as further methanol is being catalyzed. Complementary nuclear
magnetic resonance analysis of the liquid confirms the formation of methanol
and quantifies its concentration. We also show that electric fields
significantly enhance the catalysis rate, even when as small as that induced by
the natural surface potential of the silicon AFM tip. These findings could have
a significant impact on the development of organic catalysts and on the

Unfortunately, it leads to highly intractable mixed-integer nonlinear
programming problems. Existing solutions typically rely on convex relaxation,
which yield performance gaps that are difficult to quantify. Meanwhile, global
optimization algorithms such as branch-and-bound can find optimal solutions but
with prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, to obtain
near-optimal solutions at affordable complexity, we propose to approximate the
branch-and-bound algorithm via machine learning. Specifically, the pruning
procedure in branch-and-bound is formulated as a sequential decision problem,
followed by learning the oracle's action via imitation learning. A unique
advantage of this framework is that the training process only requires a small
dataset, and it is scalable to problem instances with larger dimensions than
the training setting. This is achieved by identifying and leveraging the
problem-size independent features. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the
learning based framework significantly outperforms competing methods, with
computational complexity much lower than the traditional branch-and-bound
algorithm.

  Aims. We modify and improve the dynamical self-consistency of the
Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model in the case of a stationary and axisymmetric
gravitational potential.
  Methods. Each stellar orbit is modelled by determining a Staeckel approximate
integral of motion. Generalised Shu distribution functions with three integrals
of motion are used to model the stellar distribution functions.
  Results. This new version of the Besan\c{c}on model is compared with the
previous axisymmetric BGM2014 version and we find that the two versions have
similar densities for each stellar component. The dynamically self-consistency
is improved and can be tested by recovering the forces and the potential
through the Jeans equations applied to each stellar distribution function.
Forces are recovered with an accuracy better than one per cent over most of the
volume of the Galaxy.

Yang-Mills dynamics is a positively curved (infinite dimensional) Riemannian
manifold. Expanding on this result I.M. Singer proposed that strict positivity
of the corresponding Ricci tensor (computable through zeta function
regularization) could play a fundamental role in establishing that the
associated Schroedinger operator admits a spectral gap. His argument was based
on representing the (regularized) kinetic term in the Schroedinger operator as
a Laplace-Beltrami operator on this positively curved orbit space. We revisit
Singer's proposal and show how, when the contribution of the Yang-Mills
potential energy is taken into account, the role of the original orbit space
Ricci tensor is instead played by a Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor computable from
the ground state wave functional of the quantum theory. We next review our
ongoing Euclidean-signature-semi-classical program for deriving asymptotic
expansions for such wave functionals and discuss how, by keeping the dynamical
nonlinearities and non-abelian gauge invariances intact at each level of the
analysis, our approach surpasses that of conventional perturbation theory for
the generation of approximate wave functionals. Though our main focus is on
Yang-Mills theory we derive the orbit space curvature for scalar
electrodynamics and prove that, whereas the Maxwell factor remains flat, the
interaction naturally induces positive curvature in the (charged) scalar factor
of the resulting orbit space. This has led us to the conjecture that such orbit
space curvature effects could furnish a source of mass for ordinary
Klein-Gordon type fields provided the latter are (minimally) coupled to gauge
fields, even in the abelian case. Finally we discuss the potential
applicability of our Euclidean-signature program to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation
of canonical quantum gravity.

to its simplicity and convenience since all rf photocathode guns are equipped
with an emittance compensation solenoid. This paper shows that the solenoid
scan measurement overestimates the thermal emittance in the ordinary
measurement configuration due to a weak quadrupole field (present in either the
rf gun or gun solenoid) followed by a rotation in the solenoid. This coupled
transverse dynamics aberration introduces a correlation between the beam's
horizontal and vertical motion leading to an increase in the measured 2D
transverse emittance, thus the overestimation of the thermal emittance. This
effect was systematically studied using both analytic expressions and numerical
simulations. These studies were experimentally verified using an L-band
1.6-cell rf photocathode gun with a cesium telluride cathode, which shows a
thermal emittance overestimation of 35% with a rms laser spot size of 2.7 mm.
The paper concludes by showing that the accuracy of the solenoid scan can be
improved by using a quadrupole magnet corrector, consisting of a pair of normal

particles in the ground state. By explicit calculation, we show that no
Hamiltonian up to (and including) four particle interactions produces this
state as the exact ground state, and speculate that this remains true even when
interaction terms involving greater number of particles are included.
Surprisingly, we can identify an interaction, which imposes an energetic
penalty for a specific entangled configuration of four particles with relative
angular momentum of $6\hbar$, that produces a unique zero energy solution (as
we have confirmed for up to 12 particles). This state, referred to as the
$\lambda$-state, is not identical to the projected composite-fermion state, but
the following facts suggest that the two might be topologically equivalent: the
two sates have a high overlap; they have the same root partition; the quantum
numbers for their neutral excitations are identical; and the quantum numbers
for the quasiparticle excitations also match. On the quasihole side, we find
that even though the quantum numbers of the lowest energy states agree with the
prediction from the composite-fermion theory, these states are not separated
from the others by a clearly identifiable gap. This prevents us from making a
conclusive claim regarding the topological equivalence of the $\lambda$ state

reflect our expectation how scientific theories should provide an intuitive
understanding about the foundations underlying the observed phenomena.
Recently, the absence of new physics at the LHC and the theoretical evidence
for a multiverse of alternative physical realities, predicted by our best
fundamental theories, have casted doubts about the validity of these concepts.
In this essay we argue that the discussion about Finetuning should not
predominantly concentrate on the desired features a fundamental theory is
expected to have, but rather on the question what a theory needs to qualify as
fundamental in the first place. By arguing that a fundamental description of
the Universe should possess zero entropy, we develop a 'holistic' concept for
the most fundamental layer of reality: The fundamental description of the
Universe is the Universe itself, understood as an entangled quantum state.
Adopting a universal applicability of quantum mechanics, in this framework the
behavior of subsystems can be understood as the perspectival experience of an
entangled quantum Universe perceived through the ""lens of decoherence"". In this
picture the fundamental reality is non-local, and finetuned coincidences in
effective theories may be understood in a way similar to EPR-correlations. This
notion provides a fresh view on the topic of Naturalness and Finetuning since
it suggests that Finetuning problems and hints for anthropic explanations are
an artefact of theories building up on subsystems rather than on the
fundamental description. Recent work in quantum gravity aiming at an
understanding of spacetime geometry from entanglement entropy could be
interpreted as a first sign of such a paradigm shift.

FabSearch utilizes meta-data about each part, such as material specification,

at intermediate driving forces the disks separate into bands of high and low

some cases there is a fractionation of the disk species, particularly when the
disk size ratio is large. The species phase separated regimes form a variety of

show that the formation of laning states can be enhanced by tuning the ratio of
disk radius of the two species, due to the clumping of small disks in the
interstitial regions between the large disks.

Sitter Einstein $4$-metrics from Bach-flat spacetimes by imposing simple
principles and data choices. We cast this problem in a conformally compact
Riemannian setting. Following an approach pioneered by Fefferman and Graham for
the Einstein equation, we find formal power series for conformally
compactifiable, asymptotically hyperbolic Bach-flat 4-metrics expanded about
conformal infinity. We also consider Bach-flat metrics in the special case of
constant scalar curvature and in the special case of constant $Q$-curvature.
This allows us to determine the free data at conformal infinity, and to select
those choices that lead to Einstein metrics. Interestingly, the mass is part of
that free data, in contrast to the pure Einstein case. We then choose a
convenient generalization of the Bach tensor to (bulk) dimensions $n>4$ and
consider the higher dimensional problem. We find that the free data for the
expansions split into low-order and high-order pairs. The former pair consists
of the metric on the conformal boundary and its first radial derivative, while
the latter pair consists of the radial derivatives of order $n-2$ and $n-1$.
Higher dimensional generalizations of the Bach tensor lack some of the
geometrical meaning of the 4-dimensional case. This is reflected in the
relative complexity of the higher dimensional problem, but we are able to
obtain a relatively complete result if conformal infinity is not scalar flat.

{\omega}-regular property can be represented by a Deterministic Rabin Automata
(DRA) with acceptance conditions expressed by Rabin pairs. Previous works on
Markov Chains have shown that computing the probability of satisfying a given

between the Markov Chain and the corresponding DRA. We similarly define the
notion of a product between an IMC and a DRA. Then, we show that in a product
IMC, there exists a particular assignment of the transition values that
generates a largest set of non-accepting states. Subsequently, we prove that a
lower bound is found by solving a reachability problem in that refined version

satisfiability upper bound in a product IMC with one Rabin pair. For product
IMCs with more than one Rabin pair, we establish that computing a
satisfiability upper bound is equivalent to lower-bounding the satisfiability
of the complement of the original property. A search algorithm for finding the
largest accepting and non-accepting sets of states in a product IMC is

trees must be removed early in the growing season. The proportion to be removed
is determined by the bloom intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in
the orchard. Several automated computer vision systems have been proposed to
estimate bloom intensity, but their overall performance is still far from
satisfactory even in relatively controlled environments. With the goal of
devising a technique for flower identification which is robust to clutter and
to changes in illumination, this paper presents a method in which a pre-trained
convolutional neural network is fine-tuned to become specially sensitive to
flowers. Experimental results on a challenging dataset demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms three approaches that represent the state of
the art in flower detection, with recall and precision rates higher than
$90\%$. Moreover, a performance assessment on three additional datasets
previously unseen by the network, which consist of different flower species and
were acquired under different conditions, reveals that the proposed method
highly surpasses baseline approaches in terms of generalization capability.

concentrations, like in single phase Newtonian fluids, turbulence only sets in
when triggered by sufficiently large perturbations and, as characteristic for
this transition localized turbulent regions (puffs) co-exist with laminar flow.
In agreement with earlier studies this transition point initially moves to
lower Reynolds number (Re) as the particle concentration increases. At higher
concentrations however the nature of the transition qualitatively changes:
Laminar flow gives way to a globally fluctuating state following a continuous,
non-hysteretic transition. A further increase in Re results in a secondary
instability where localized puff-like structures arise on top of the uniformly
fluctuating background flow. At even higher concentration only the uniformly
fluctuating flow is found and signatures of Newtonian type turbulence are no

considering galaxy groups or linear if they are excluded, but we argue that
most likely the behavior is sublinear. When systematically studying the

Riccati recursion, allowing for super-fast solutions to the LQR problem while
still generating feedback control policies. We demonstrate empirically that our

originally selected from radio-continuum observations at 3 GHz, and includes
about 1800 radio AGN identified via ($>2\sigma$) radio-excess relative to the

the average s-BHAR in each $L^{\rm AGN}_{\rm 1.4}$-$z$ bin. We find that the

of the environment, meaning that the agent can only know the reward of a state
if it encounters that state in a trial run. However, we argue that this is an
unnecessary limitation and instead, the reward function should be provided to
the learning algorithm. The advantage is that the algorithm can then use the
reward function to check the reward for states that the agent hasn't even
encountered yet. In addition, the algorithm can simultaneously learn policies
for multiple reward functions. For each state, the algorithm would calculate
the reward using each of the reward functions and add the rewards to its
experience replay dataset. The Hindsight Experience Replay algorithm developed
by Andrychowicz et al. (2017) does just this, and learns to generalize across a
distribution of sparse, goal-based rewards. We extend this algorithm to
linearly-weighted, multi-objective rewards and learn a single policy that can
generalize across all linear combinations of the multi-objective reward.
Whereas other multi-objective algorithms teach the Q-function to generalize
across the reward weights, our algorithm enables the policy to generalize, and
can thus be used with continuous actions.

allow us to prove that, at any fixed time, the spatial decay of quantum

a new light-cone for power-law interacting quantum systems, which captures the
region of the system where changing the Hamiltonian can affect the evolution of

quintessential ingredients of quantum phase transitions can be probed directly
with quench dynamics in integrable and nearly integrable systems. As a
paradigmatic example, we study global quench dynamics in a transverse-field
Ising model with either short-range or long-range interactions. When the model
is integrable, we discover a new dynamical critical point with a non-analytic
signature in the short-range correlators. The location of the dynamical
critical point matches that of the quantum critical point and can be identified
using a finite-time scaling method. We extend this scaling picture to systems
near integrability and demonstrate the continued existence of a dynamical
critical point detectable at prethermal time scales. Therefore, our method can
be used to approximately locate the quantum critical point. The scaling method
is also relevant to experiments with finite time and system size, and our
predictions are testable in near-term experiments with trapped ions and Rydberg

on the density at shock emergence. We present 26 rising optical light curves of
SN II candidates discovered shortly after explosion by the High cadence
Transient Survey (HiTS) and derive physical parameters based on hydrodynamical
models using a Bayesian approach. We observe a steep rise of a few days in 24
out of 26 SN II candidates, indicating the systematic detection of shock
breakouts in a dense circumstellar matter consistent with a mass loss rate
$\dot{M} > 10^{-4} M_\odot yr^{-1}$ or a dense atmosphere. This implies that
the characteristic hour timescale signature of stellar envelope SBOs may be
rare in nature and could be delayed into longer-lived circumstellar material
shock breakouts in most Type II SNe.

expand on the work of Weisz et al. 2012 to consider a wider range of SFHs and
stellar metallicities, and show that there are large degeneracies in a
periodic, top-hat burst model. We argue that all galaxies of a given mass have
similar SFHs and we can therefore include the $L_{H\alpha}$ distributions
(subtracting the median trend with stellar mass, referred to as $\Delta
\text{log}(L_{H\alpha})$) in our analyses. $\Delta \text{log}(L_{H\alpha})$
traces the amplitude of the bursts, and log($L_{H\alpha}/L_{UV}$) is a function
of timescale, amplitude, and shape of the bursts. We examine the 2-dimensional
distribution of these two indicators constrain the SFHs. We use exponentially
rising/falling bursts to determine timescales ($e$-folding time, $\tau$). We
find that galaxies below $10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ undergo large (amplitudes of
$\sim 100$) and rapid ($\tau < 30$ Myr) bursts, while galaxies above $10^{8.5}$
M$_{\odot}$ experience smaller (maximum amplitudes $\sim 10$), slower ($\tau
\gtrsim 300$ Myr) bursts. We compare to the FIRE-2 hydrodynamical simulations
and find that the burst amplitudes agree with observations, but they are too
rapid in more massive galaxies ($M_* > 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$). Finally, we confirm
that stochastic sampling of the stellar mass function can not reproduce the
observed distributions unless the standard assumptions of cluster and stellar
mass functions are changed. With the next generation of telescopes,
measurements of $L_{UV}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$ will become available for dwarf

extinction corrections. We investigate to what degree the so-called

We estimate the intrinsic scatter in the luminosity-decline-rate relation, and
find it ranges from $\pm 0.13$ mag to $\pm 0.18$ mag with no obvious dependence
on wavelength. Using the Cepheid variable star data from the SH0ES project
(Riess et al., 2016), the SNIa distance scale is calibrated and the Hubble

results are compared to those determined exclusively from a near-infrared

investigated as a function of wavelength and is found to decrease toward redder
wavelengths, suggesting this effect may be due to dust properties of the host.
Using estimates of the dust extinction derived from optical and NIR
wavelengths, and applying these to H band, we derive a Hubble constant $H_0 =

occurs in models where long-lived dark-sector particles are produced along with
the neutrinos in a beam-dump environment and interact with neutrino detectors
downstream, producing an on-shell boson which decays into a pair of charged

with the standard model exclusively through a dark photon, and concentrate on
the region of parameter space where the dark photon mass is smaller than twice
that of the dark matter particle and hence decays exclusively into
standard-model particles. We compute event rates and discuss search strategies

detectors aligned with the Booster beam at Fermilab -- MicroBooNE, SBND, and

exploring the implications of measured non-gravitational acceleration for the

rapid evolution of 'Oumuamua's spin (on a timescale of a few days), assuming
torque asymmetry typical for the Solar System comets. However, given the highly
elongated shape of the object, its torque asymmetry is likely higher, implying
even faster evolution. This would have resulted in rapid rotational fission of
'Oumuamua during its journey through the Solar System and is clearly
incompatible with the relative stability of its rotational state inferred from

questionable.

source detections makes absolute image alignment at the necessary accuracy
impossible, we can measure the change in the diameter and the area of the
remnant, and find that it has expanded by an average velocity of 4170 (2860,
5450) km s$^{-1}$. This supports the picture of this being a young remnant;
this expansion velocity corresponds to an undecelerated age of 850 yr, making
the real age somewhat younger, consistent with results from light echo studies.
Previous infrared observations have revealed high densities in the western half
of the remnant, likely from circumstellar material, so it is likely that the
real expansion velocity is lower on that side of the remnant and higher on the

In this paper, we describe a method based on level sets and specifically

of using a level sets approach on large image volumes for root segmentation,
and track active regions of the front using an occupancy grid. This method
allows for straightforward modifications to a narrow-band algorithm such that
excessive forward and backward movements of the front can be avoided, distance
map computations in a narrow band context can be done in linear time through
modification of Meijster et al.'s distance transform algorithm, and regions of
the image volume are iteratively used to estimate distributions for root versus
non-root classes. Results are shown of three plant species of different
maturity levels, grown in three different media. Our method compares favorably
to a state-of-the-art method for root segmentation in X-ray CT image volumes.

the depth of each quadrant of a patient's lung. The resultant videos are
outsourced to an online community of non-expert users who, after a brief

crowdsourcing workflow, we achieved a lung nodule detection sensitivity of over
90% for 20 patient CT datasets (containing 178 lung nodules with sizes between

heavy (charm and bottom) quarks, thereby producing higher transverse momentum
final particles, that could explain several anomalies observed in the data. The
electromagnetic, hadronic, and muonic properties of EAS generated with various

generators. The only exceptions are the muonic components at large transverse
distances from the shower axis, where PYTHIA predicts more activity than the

solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical for understanding and
controlling interfacial degradation mechanisms in lithium containing battery
systems. To study these critical battery materials and interfaces X ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a widely used technique that provides
quantitative chemical insights. However, due to the fact that a majority of
chemical phases relevant to battery interfaces are poor electronic conductors,
phase identification that relies primarily on absolute XPS core level
binding-energies (BEs) can be problematic. Charging during XPS measurements
leads to BE shifts that can be difficult to correct. These difficulties are
often exacerbated by the coexistence of multiple Li containing phases in the
SEI with overlapping XPS core levels. To facilitate accurate phase
identification of battery relevant phases, we propose a straightforward
approach for removing charging effects from XPS data sets. We apply this
approach to XPS data sets acquired from six battery relevant inorganic phases
including lithium metal (Li0), lithium oxide (Li2O), lithium peroxide (Li2O2),
lithium hydroxide (LiOH), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), and lithium nitride
(Li3N). Specifically, we demonstrate that BE separations between core levels
present in a particular phase (e.g. BE separation between the O 1s and Li 1s
core levels in Li2O) provide an additional constraint that can significantly
improve reliability of phase identification. Finally, as an exemplary case we
apply the charge-correction methodology to XPS data acquired from a symmetric
cell based on a Li2S P2S5 solid electrolyte. This analysis demonstrates that
accurately accounting for XPS BE shifts as a function of current-bias
conditions can provide a direct probe of ionic conductivities associated with
battery materials.

magnetar formed at the moment of the explosion. While this scenario has mostly
been applied to hydrogen-free events, it may be possible also for hydrogen-rich
objects. Aims: We explore the effect of including a magnetar on the light
curves of supernovae with H-rich progenitors. Methods: We have applied a
version of our one-dimensional LTE radiation hydrodynamics code that takes into
account the relativistic motion of the ejecta caused by the extra energy
provided by the magnetar. For a fixed red supergiant (RSG) progenitor, we have
obtained a set of light curves that corresponds to different values of the
magnetar initial rotation energy and the spin-down timescale. The model is
applied to SN~2004em and OGLE-2014-SN-073, two peculiar Type II SNe with
long-rising SN1987A-like light curves, although with much larger luminosities.
Results: The presence of a plateau phase in either normal or superluminous
supernovae is one possible outcome, even if a magnetar is continuously
injecting energy into the ejecta.In other cases, the light curve shows a peak
but not a plateau. Also, there are intermediate events with a first peak
followed by a slow decline and a late break of the declining slope. Our models
show that bright and long rising morphologies are possible even assuming RSG
structures. Conclusions: A large number of supernova discoveries per year

because it requires successive applications of magnetic field gradients to
encode for spatial location. Parallel MRI accelerates imaging by permitting
undersampling of k-space using multiple detectors, each with a unique spatial
sensitivity to the radio field emitted by the object. This is called spatial
sensitivity encoding. A fourfold undersampling means a fourfold acceleration,
however a five-fold undersampling cannot be reconstructed. This is because too
much reliance is placed on spatial sensitivity encoding, and spatial
sensitivity encoding is less efficient than gradient encoding when the
detectors are large.
  On the contrary, we hypothesized that when very large numbers of very small
detectors are deployed, it would render spatial sensitivity encoding efficient,
and would allow complete elimination of gradient reversals and therefore
extremely rapid MR imaging. Since each detector receives all of the signal from
all of the object all of the time, signal is expected to be high, and each
detector is predicted to receive signal of the same order of magnitude as one
large detector in conventional MRI. Moreover, the elimination of gradients
removes the major source of electrical noise. Unexpectedly, therefore, we
anticipate that signal-to-noise (SNR) will be high.
  By means of a detailed simulation, in which the exact Hertzian radio field is
simulated for each of 32x32x32 voxels interacting with each of 1024 detector
loops, we demonstrate that 3-dimensional MR images can indeed be acquired very
quickly. Nevertheless, we also simulated imaging in the presence of unforeseen
sources of noise, and found that image reconstruction is resistant to noise,
even with unrealistically low SNR values.
  In summary, high quality volumetric MRI is likely to be achievable in
milliseconds.

elastic constants and vibrational modes for BCC/HCP elements, while those

design of NOMA schedulers. A successful NOMA scheduler has to carefully balance
the following three objectives: maximizing average system utility, satisfying
desired fairness constraints among the users and enabling real-time, and low
computational cost implementations. In this paper, scheduling for NOMA systems
under temporal fairness constraints is considered. Temporal fair scheduling
leads to communication systems with predictable latency as opposed to
utilitarian fair schedulers for which latency can be highly variable. It is
shown that optimal system utility is achieved using a class of opportunistic
scheduling schemes called threshold based strategies (TBS). One of the
challenges in temporal fair scheduling for heterogeneous NOMA scenarios - where
only specific users may be activated simultaneously - is to determine the set
of feasible temporal shares. In this work, a variable elimination algorithm is
proposed to accomplish this task. Furthermore, an (online) iterative algorithm
based on the Robbins-Monro method is proposed to construct a TBS by finding the
optimal thresholds for a given system utility metric. Various numerical
simulations of practical scenarios are provided to illustrate the effectiveness

Contact-implicit trajectory optimization methods offer a solution to this by
allowing the optimization to make or break contacts as needed, but thus far

understanding of how brain function differs across time, individual, and

is the identification of reliable features that describe the function of the
brain, while accounting for individual heterogeneity. Our work is motivated by
two particularly important challenges in this area: first, how can one analyze
functional connectivity data over populations of individuals, and second, how
can one use these analyses to infer group similarities and differences.
Motivated by these challenges, we model population connectivity data as a
multilayer network and develop the multi-node2vec algorithm, an efficient and
scalable embedding method that automatically learns continuous node feature
representations from multilayer networks. We use multi-node2vec to analyze
resting state fMRI scans over a group of 74 healthy individuals and 60 patients

used to visualize, cluster, and classify functional regions of the brain for
these individuals. We furthermore compare the multilayer network embeddings of
the two groups. We identify significant differences between the groups in the
default mode network and salience network - findings that are supported by the
triple network model theory of cognitive organization. Our findings reveal that
multi-node2vec is a powerful and reliable method for analyzing multilayer

reliable and drift-less pose estimation. Extensive experiments show that our

poorly in the presence of contaminating sources of similar or smaller spatial
scale than the desired signal, especially if signal and contaminants are
spatially correlated. We introduce new multicomponent MF and matched

Using microwave mock data, we show that our method allows for unbiased

spatial resolution to reach a competitive noise level after filtering. A
comparison of various MF and MMF techniques is given by applying them to Planck
multifrequency data of the Perseus galaxy cluster, whose brightest cluster
galaxy hosts a powerful radio source known as Perseus A. We also give a brief
outline how the constrained MF (CMF) introduced in this work can be used to

(1957) conjectured that for any $p \geq q \geq d+1$ there exists $c=c_d(p,q)$,
such that any family of compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfies
the $(p,q)$ property, can be pierced by at most $c$ points. In a celebrated
result from 1992, Alon and Kleitman proved the conjecture. However, obtaining
sharp bounds on $c_d(p,q)$, called `the Hadwiger-Debrunner numbers', is still a
major open problem in discrete and computational geometry. The best currently
known lower bound on the Hadwiger-Debrunner numbers in the plane is $c_2(p,q) =
\Omega( \frac{p}{q}\log(\frac{p}{q}))$ while the best known upper bound is
$O(p^{(1.5+\delta)(1+\frac{1}{q-2})})$.
  In this paper we improve the lower bound significantly by showing that
$c_2(p,q) \geq p^{1+\Omega(1/q)}$. Furthermore, the bound is obtained by a
family of lines, and is tight for all families that have a bounded
VC-dimension. Unlike previous bounds on the Hadwiger-Debrunner numbers which
mainly used the weak epsilon-net theorem, our bound stems from a surprising
connection of the $(p,q)$ problem to an old problem of Erd\H{o}s on points in
general position in the plane. We use a novel construction for the Erd\H{o}s'
problem, obtained recently by Balogh and Solymosi using the hypergraph
container method, to get the lower bound on $c_2(p,3)$. We then generalize the
bound to $c_2(p,q)$ for any $q \geq 3$.

the Lie algebra of the exceptional Lie group G_2 was realized as the symmetry

each twisted cubic. We study the local geometry of the resulting structures
(M,C,S,s), which we call marked contact Engel structures. Equivalently, our
study can be viewed as a study of foliations of M by curves whose tangent

trajectory when the longitudinal data are sparsely and irregularly observed and
noise-contaminated. Such data are popularly analyzed with functional principal
component analysis via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE)
method. The PACE method may sometimes be numerically unstable because it
involves the inverse of the covariance matrix. We propose a sparse orthonormal
approximation (SOAP) method as an alternative. It estimates the optimal
empirical basis functions in the best approximation framework rather than
eigen-decomposing the covariance function. The SOAP method avoids estimating
the mean and covariance function, which is challenging when the assembled time
points with observations for all subjects are not sufficiently dense. The SOAP
method avoids the inverse of the covariance matrix, hence the computation is
more stable. It does not require the functional principal component scores to
follow the Gaussian distribution. We show that the SOAP estimate for the
optimal empirical basis function is asymptotically consistent. The finite
sample performance of the SOAP method is investigated in simulation studies in
comparison with the PACE method. Our method is demonstrated by recovering the

neural networks with a quadratic cost function one layer at a time starting
from the input layer. The algorithm is based on the fact that for any layer to
be trained, the effect of a direct connection to an optimized linear output
layer can be computed without the connection being made. Thus, starting from
the input layer, we can train each layer in succession in isolation from the
other layers. Once trained, the weights are kept fixed and the outputs of the
trained layer then serve as the inputs to the next layer to be trained. The
result is a very fast algorithm. The simplicity of this training arrangement
allows the activation function and step size in weight adjustment to be
adaptive and self-adjusting. Furthermore, the stability of the training process
allows relatively large steps to be taken and thereby achieving in even greater
speeds. Finally, in our context configuring the network means determining the
number of outputs for each layer. By decomposing the overall cost function into
separate components related to approximation and estimation, we obtain an
optimization formula for determining the number of outputs for each layer. With
the ability to self-configure and set parameters, we now have more than a fast

atmospheres of brown dwarfs (BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets
(EGPs). In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-IR brightness
variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings of
atmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous
studies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to
seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the
thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large
opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this
work, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a
self-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing,
cloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show
that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in
both temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and
directly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are one to tens of
hours with typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of Kelvins in
effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range
of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to
model parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important
implications for the observed flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs,
especially those evolve in short timescales. It is also a promising mechanism
for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L/T transition of
brown dwarfs.

the dyadic square function operator $S$, and Davis found the sharp values of

more subtle characteristic of the above estimate. This quantity is called the
Bellman function of the problem, and it seems to us that it was never proved
that the confluent hypergeometric function from Davis' paper (second page)
basically gives this Bellman function. Here we fill out this gap by finding the
exact Bellman function of the unweighted $L^p$ estimate for operator $S$. We

Facets are definable aspects that make up a subject or an object. Contributions
are shareable and formal evidence, carrying specific properties, and produced
as a result of a crowd-based scientific investigation. Constraints of data are
restrictions defining domain-specific rules of association between entities and
relationships. A computational representation serves as a layer of abstraction
that is required in order to define domain-specific concepts in computers, in a
way these concepts can be shared in a crowd for the purposes of a controlled
scientific investigation in large-scale by crowds. Facets, contributions, and
constraints of data are defined for any domain of knowledge by the application
of a generic set of inputs, procedural steps, and products called a
representational process. The application of this generic process to our domain

this paper in terms of its three elements: facets (streaming, reactives,
distribution, and simulation), contributions (financial models, processors, and
endpoints), and constraints of data (configuration, execution, and simulation
meta-model). Each element of the generic representational process and the Sigma

To handle constrained optimization, we first propose generalizations of the

stochastic gradient algorithm using only zeroth-order information. To
facilitate zeroth-order optimization in high-dimensions, we explore the
advantages of structural sparsity assumptions. Specifically, (i) we highlight
an implicit regularization phenomenon where the standard stochastic gradient
algorithm with zeroth-order information adapts to the sparsity of the problem
at hand by just varying the step-size and (ii) propose a truncated stochastic
gradient algorithm with zeroth-order information, whose rate of convergence
depends only poly-logarithmically on the dimensionality. We next focus on
avoiding saddle-points in non-convex setting. Towards that, we interpret the
Gaussian smoothing technique for estimating gradient based on zeroth-order

we provide a novel linear-(in dimension) time estimator of the Hessian matrix

We compare our BLFQ results with the limiting case of a single BLFQ basis state

applications related to classical and quantum frequency conversion, which have
attracted significant interest recently in on-chip implementation. These
processes rely on phase matching among the interacting guided modes, and
refractive index engineering has been a primary approach for this purpose.
Unfortunately, the modal phase matching approaches developed so far only
produce parametric generation with fairly low efficiencies, due to the
intrinsic modal mismatch of spatial symmetries. Here we propose a universal
design and operation principle for highly efficient optical parametric
generation on integrated photonic platforms. By introducing spatial symmetry
breaking into the optical nonlinearity of the device, we are able to
dramatically enhance the nonlinear parametric interaction to realize an
extremely high efficiency. We employ this approach to design and fabricate a
heterogeneous titanium oxide/lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide that is
able to offer second-harmonic generation with a theoretical conversion
efficiency as high as 2900% W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, which enables us to
experimentally achieve a conversion efficiency of 36.0% W$^{-1}$ in a waveguide
only 2.35 mm long, corresponding to a recorded normalized efficiency of 650%
W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ that is significantly beyond the reach of conventional modal
phase matching approaches. Unlike nonlinearity domain engineering that is
material selective, the proposed operation principle can be flexibly applied to
any other on-chip quadratic nonlinear platform to support ultra-highly
efficient optical parametric interactions, thus opening up a great avenue
towards extreme nonlinear and quantum optics with great potentials for broad
applications in energy efficient nonlinear and quantum photonic signal
processing.

Comments and suggestions are most welcome",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that a quantum phase transition can occur in a phonon system in the
presence of dislocations. Due to the competing nature between the topological
protection of the dislocation and anharmonicity, phonons can reach a quantum
critical point at a frequency determined by dislocation density and the
anharmonic constant, at zero temperature. In the symmetry-broken phase, a novel
phonon state is developed with a dynamically-induced dipole field. We carry out
a renormalization group analysis and show that the phonon critical behavior
differs wildly from any electronic system. In particular, at the critical
point, a single phonon mode dominates the density of states and develops an
exotic logarithmic divergence in thermal conductivity. This phonon quantum
criticality provides a completely new avenue to tailor phonon transport at the
single-mode level without using phononic crystals.

realized such a regime of light-matter interaction by coupling the cyclotron
motion of a collection of electrons on the surface of liquid helium to the
microwave field in a semi-confocal Fabry-Perot resonator. For the co-rotating
component of the microwave field, the strong coupling is pronouncedly
manifested by the normal-mode splitting in the spectrum of coupled
field-particle motion. We present a complete description of this phenomenon
based on classical electrodynamics, as well as show that the full quantum
treatment of this problem results in mean-value equations of motion that are
equivalent to our classical result. For the counter-rotating component of the
microwave field, we observe a strong resonance when the microwave frequency is
close to both the cyclotron and cavity frequencies. We show that this
surprising effect, which is not expected to occur under the rotating-wave
approximation, results from the mixing between two polarization components of
the microwave field in our cavity.

to use hash functions with a certain locality-preserving property to transform
samples to enhance the robustness of DNNs in malware classification. The
framework further uses a Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) regularizer to
reconstruct the hash representations of samples, making the resulting DNN
classifiers capable of attaining the locality information in the latent space.
We experiment with two concrete instantiations of the HashTran-DNN framework to
classify Android malware. Experimental results show that four known attacks can
render standard DNNs useless in classifying Android malware, that known
defenses can at most defend three of the four attacks, and that HashTran-DNN
can effectively defend against all of the four attacks.

  Rapids",,"10.1017/jfm.2018.980",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current global ocean models rely on ad-hoc parameterizations of diapycnal
mixing, in which the efficiency of mixing is globally assumed to be fixed at
$20\%$, despite increasing evidence that this assumption is questionable. As an
ansatz for small-scale ocean turbulence, we may focus on stratified shear flows
susceptible to either Kelvin-Helmholtz (KHI) or Holmboe wave (HWI) instability.
Recently, an unprecedented volume of data has been generated through direct
numerical simulation (DNS) of these flows. In this paper, we describe the
application of deep learning methods to the discovery of a generic
parameterization of diapycnal mixing using the available DNS dataset. We
furthermore demonstrate that the proposed model is far more universal compared
to recently published parameterizations. We show that a neural network
appropriately trained on KHI- and HWI-induced turbulence is capable of
predicting mixing efficiency associated with unseen regions of the parameter
space well beyond the range of the training data. Strikingly, the high-level
patterns learned based on the KHI and weakly stratified HWI are `transferable'
to predict HWI-induced mixing efficiency under much more strongly stratified
conditions, suggesting that through the application of appropriate networks,
significant universal abstractions of density stratified turbulent mixing have
been recognized.

temporal complexity analysis of real-world phenomena. However, their
relationship with the Hurst exponent as a measure of self-similarity is not
widely studied. Additionally, ApEn and SampEn are susceptible to signal
amplitude changes. A common practice for addressing this issue is to correct
their input signal amplitude by its standard deviation. In this study, we first
show, using simulations, that ApEn and SampEn are related to the Hurst exponent
in their tolerance r and embedding dimension m parameters. We then propose a
modification to ApEn and SampEn called range entropy or RangeEn. We show that
RangeEn is more robust to nonstationary signal changes, and it has a more
linear relationship with the Hurst exponent, compared to ApEn and SampEn.
RangeEn is bounded in the tolerance r-plane between 0 (maximum entropy) and 1
(minimum entropy) and it has no need for signal amplitude correction. Finally,
we demonstrate the clinical usefulness of signal entropy measures for
characterisation of epileptic EEG data as a real-world example.

dependent variable and want to include fixed effects (group specific
intercepts) in the specification, is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in any way
superior to a (conditional) logit form? In particular, what are the
consequences of using OLS instead of a fixed effects logit model with respect
to the latter dropping all units which show no variability in the dependent
variable while the former allows for estimation using all units. First, we show
that the discussion of fthe incidental parameters problem is based on an
assumption about the kinds of data being studied; for what appears to be the
common use of fixed effect models in political science the incidental
parameters issue is illusory. Turning to linear models, we see that OLS yields
a linear combination of the estimates for the units with and without variation
in the dependent variable, and so the coefficient estimates must be carefully
interpreted. The article then compares two methods of estimating logit models
with fixed effects, and shows that the Chamberlain conditional logit is as good
as or better than a logit analysis which simply includes group specific
intercepts (even though the conditional logit technique was designed to deal
with the incidental parameters problem!). Related to this, the article
discusses the estimation of marginal effects using both OLS and logit. While it
appears that a form of logit with fixed effects can be used to estimate
marginal effects, this method can be improved by starting with conditional
logit and then using the those parameter estimates to constrain the logit with
fixed effects model. This method produces estimates of sample average marginal
effects that are at least as good as OLS, and much better when group size is
small or the number of groups is large. .

consider scene text recognition as a sequence prediction problem. Though
achieving excellent performance, these methods usually neglect an important
fact that text in images are actually distributed in two-dimensional space. It
is a nature quite different from that of speech, which is essentially a
one-dimensional signal. In principle, directly compressing features of text
into a one-dimensional form may lose useful information and introduce extra
noise. In this paper, we approach scene text recognition from a two-dimensional
perspective. A simple yet effective model, called Character Attention Fully
Convolutional Network (CA-FCN), is devised for recognizing the text of
arbitrary shapes. Scene text recognition is realized with a semantic
segmentation network, where an attention mechanism for characters is adopted.
Combined with a word formation module, CA-FCN can simultaneously recognize the
script and predict the position of each character. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm outperforms previous methods on both regular and
irregular text datasets. Moreover, it is proven to be more robust to imprecise
localizations in the text detection phase, which are very common in practice.

quasiparticle energies and accounting for excitonic effects by solving the

Proof-of-Work, in which users must solve a computationally hard cryptopuzzle to
authorize transactions (`one unit of computation, one vote'). This leads to
enormous expenditure on hardware and electricity in order to collect the
rewards associated with transaction authorization. Proof-of-Stake is an
alternative concept that instead selects users to authorize transactions
proportional to their wealth (`one coin, one vote'). Some aspects of the two
paradigms are the same. For instance, obtaining voting power in Proof-of-Stake
has a monetary cost just as in Proof-of-Work: a coin cannot be freely
duplicated any more easily than a unit of computation. However some aspects are
fundamentally different. In particular, exactly because Proof-of-Stake is
wasteless, there is no inherent resource cost to deviating (commonly referred
to as the `Nothing-at-Stake' problem).
  In contrast to prior work, we focus on incentive-driven deviations (any
participant will deviate if doing so yields higher revenue) instead of
adversarial corruption (an adversary may take over a significant fraction of
the network, but the remaining players follow the protocol). The main results
of this paper are several formal barriers to designing incentive-compatible
proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (that don't apply to proof-of-work).

operation and the surge in video streaming demands, Streaming Service Providers
(SSPs) are becoming reliant on cloud services to guarantee Quality of Service
(QoS) of streaming for their viewers. Cloud providers offer heterogeneous
computational services in form of different types of Virtual Machines (VMs)
with diverse prices. Effective utilization of cloud services for video
transcoding requires detailed performance analysis of different video
transcoding operations on the heterogeneous cloud VMs. In this research, for
the first time, we provide a thorough analysis of the performance of the video
stream transcoding on heterogeneous cloud VMs. Providing such analysis is
crucial for efficient prediction of transcoding time on heterogeneous VMs and
for the functionality of any scheduling methods tailored for video transcoding.
Based upon the findings of this analysis and by considering the cost difference
of heterogeneous cloud VMs, in this research, we also provide a model to
quantify the degree of suitability of each cloud VM type for various
transcoding tasks. The provided model can supply resource (VM) provisioning
methods with accurate performance and cost trade-offs to efficiently utilize

human and much current research attempts to explain this fact. We draw upon
social, cultural, and psychological aspects of human uniqueness to present an
integrated theory of human cooperation that explains aspects of human
cooperation that are problematic for other theories (e.g., defector invasion
avoidance, preferential assortment to exclude free riders, and the second order
free rider problem). We propose that the evolution of human cooperative
behavior required (1) a capacity for self-sustained, self-referential thought
manifested as an integrated worldview, including a sense of identity and point
of view, and (2) the cultural formation of kinship-based social organizational
systems within which social identities can be established and transmitted
through enculturation. Human cooperative behavior arose, we argue, through the
acquisition of a culturally grounded social identity that included the
expectation of cooperation among kin. This identity is linked to basic survival
instincts by emotions that are mentally experienced as culture laden feelings.
As a consequence, individuals are motivated to cooperate with those perceived
culturally as kin, while deviations from expected social behavior are
experienced as threatening to one's social identity, leading to punishment of
those seen as violating cultural expectations regarding socially proper
behavior.

the abrupt torque generated by LKAS. This kind of unpleasant experience can
lead to prolonged negative feelings such as irritation, anxiety, and distrust

underperform in comparison with STL methods. In this paper, we propose a
privacy-preserving MTL framework to prevent information from each model leaking

the equality holds for any $k\ge r$. In this paper, we mainly prove the
following results:
  (1) For every positive integer $k\ge 6$, we have $$\mathsf

ultrasmall grains of a few Angstroms to micrometer-size grains. While the
presence of nanometer-size dust grains in the Galactic interstellar medium was
speculated six decades ago and was previously suggested based on early infrared
observations, systematic and direct analysis of their properties over a wide
range of environments has been lacking. Here we report the detection of
nanometer-size dust grains that appear to be universally present in a wide
variety of astronomical environments, from Galactic high-latitude clouds to
nearby star-forming galaxies and galaxies with low levels of nuclear activity.
The prevalence of such a grain population is revealed conclusively as prominent
mid-infrared continuum emission at wavelength short than 10\mu m seen in the
Spitzer/IRS data, characterized by temperatures of ~300-400K that are
significantly higher than the equilibrium temperatures of common,
submicron-size grains in typical galactic environments. We propose that the
optimal carriers of this pervasive, featureless hot dust component are very
small carbonaceous (e.g., graphite) grains of nanometer size that are
transiently heated by single-photon absorption. This grain population accounts
for ~1.4% of the total infrared emission at ~5-3000\mu m and ~0.4% of the total

The novelty of the formulation is the method for temporal integration which
results in preserving the SCL property and retaining the higher order accuracy
at the same time. Once the time derivative is discretized (based on integration
or differentiation formula), the common approach for terms in differential
equation which do not involve temporal derivative is classified to be a kind of
""time averaging"" between time steps. In the spirit of classical approaches,
this involves evaluating these terms in several points in time between the
current and the previous time step ($[t_n,t_{n+1}]$), and then averaging them
in order to provide the satisfaction of discrete SCL. Here, we fully use the
polynomial in time form of mapping through which evolution of domain is
realized -- the so called ALE map -- in order to avoid the problematics arising
due to the moving grids. We give a general recipe on temporal schemes that have
to be employed once the discretization for the temporal derivative is chosen.
Numerical investigations on stability, accuracy and convergence are performed

existing theoretical and experimental results. Application of an external field
to the AB bilayer alters the electronic spectrum, with the bands changing under

a semi-metal-to-semiconductor phase transition, with the size of the induced
electronic band-gap being tuneable through the field strength. A reduction of
continuous symmetry from a hexagonal to a triangular lattice is also evidenced
through in-plane electronic charge inhomogeneities between the sublattices.
When spin-orbit coupling is turned on for the AB system, we find that the bulk
gap decreases, gradually increasing for larger intensities of the bias. Under
large bias the energy dispersion recovers the Mexican hat structure, since the
energy interaction between the layers balances the coupling interaction. We
find that external bias perturbs the harmonic phonon spectra and leads to
anomalous behaviour of the out-of-plane flexural ZA and layer-breathing ZO'
modes. For the AA system, the electronic and phonon dispersions both remain
stable under bias, but the phonon spectrum exhibits zone-center imaginary modes
due to layer-sliding dynamical instabilities.

With respect to a downsampled low resolution image, we model a high resolution
image as a combination of two components, a deterministic component and a
stochastic component. The deterministic component can be recovered from the
low-frequency signals in the downsampled image. The stochastic component, on
the other hand, contains the signals that have little correlation with the low
resolution image. We adopt two complementary methods for generating these two
components. While generative adversarial networks are used for the stochastic
component, deterministic component reconstruction is formulated as a regression
problem solved using deep neural networks. Since the deterministic component
exhibits clearer local orientations, we design novel loss functions tailored
for such properties for training the deep regression network. These two methods
are first applied to the entire input image to produce two distinct
high-resolution images. Afterwards, these two images are fused together using
another deep neural network that also performs local statistical rectification,
which tries to make the local statistics of the fused image match the same
local statistics of the groundtruth image. Quantitative results and a user

the simplest type of user information (location and time) on ATIS benchmark

0.31% for slot filling using standard training data. When using smaller

giving up finding an exact solution, we restrict the solution space to its most

find the exact optimum efficiently within the subset. Specifically, the

aggregated into a smaller number of clusters, in which the states behave {\em

Markov chain with this structure is called {\em quasi-lumpable}. This property
allows the {\em aggregation} of states (nodes) into clusters. Our main
contribution is a rigorously proved bound on the rate at which the aggregated

also demonstrate numerically that in certain cases this can indeed lead to a

can be a useful tool in the analysis of complex networks, whenever they have a

constructions and hundreds of further references therein. In many cases it is
not at all clear how the modeling strength of differently generated random
graph model classes relate to each other. We would like to systematically
investigate such issues. Our approach was originally motivated to capture
properties of the random network topology of wireless communication networks.
We started some investigations, but here we elevate it to a more general level
that makes it possible to compare the strength of different classes of random
network models. Specially, we introduce various classes of random graph models
that are significantly more general than the ones that are usually treated in
the literature, and show relationships among them. One of our main results is
that no random graph model can fall in the following three classes at the same
time: (1) random graph models with bounded expected degrees; (2) random graph
models that are asymptotically almost connected; (3) an abstracted version of
geometric random graph models with two mild restrictions that we call locality
and name invariance. In other words, in a mildly restricted, but still very
general, class of generalized geometric-style models the requirements of
bounded expected degrees and asymptotic almost connectivity are incompatible.

applied to various CNN architectures to reduce their model size. MBS adaptively
reduces each CNN macroblock depending on its information redundancy measured by
our proposed effective flops. Empirical studies conducted with ImageNet and
CIFAR-10 attest that MBS can reduce the model size of some already compact CNN
models, e.g., MobileNetV2 (25.03% further reduction) and ShuffleNet (20.74%),
and even ultra-deep ones such as ResNet-101 (51.67%) and ResNet-1202 (72.71%)
with negligible accuracy degradation. MBS also performs better reduction at a
much lower cost than the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods do. MBS's
simplicity and efficiency, its flexibility to work with any CNN model, and its
scalability to work with models of any depth make it an attractive choice for
CNN model size reduction.

covariance matrix of a noise distribution and did not consider the direction of
the noise vector and its correlation. In addition, fast updates of the noise
distribution are required to facilitate policy learning. We propose a method
that deforms the noise distribution according to the accumulated returns and
the noises that have led to the returns. Moreover, this method switches
isotropic exploration and directional exploration in parameter space with
regard to obtained rewards. We validate our exploration strategy in the OpenAI
Gym continuous environments and modified environments with sparse rewards. The
proposed method achieves results that are competitive with a previous method at
baseline tasks. Moreover, our approach exhibits better performance in sparse

a common approach is to integrate $f$ over the inactive, i.e. non-dominant,

be done with a finite Monte Carlo sum, making not only the resulting
approximation random in the inactive variable for each fixed input from the

Form (BNF) which is annotated by constraints typical for labeled acyclic
directed graphs (DAG). The BNF induction begins from a collection of neural
unit symbols with extra (up to five) decoration fields (including tensor depth
and sharing fields). The inductive rules provide not only the general graph
structure but also the specific shortcuts for residual blocks of units. A
syntactic mechanism for network fragments modularization is introduced via user
defined units and their instances. Moreover, the dual BNF rules are specified
in order to generate the Dual Symbolic Tensor Neural Network (DSTNN). The
joined interpretation of STNN and DSTNN provides the correct flow of gradient
tensors, back propagated at the training stage. The proposed symbolic
representation of CNNs is illustrated for six generic digital media
applications (CREAMS): Compression, Recognition, Embedding, Annotation, 3D
Modeling for human-computer interfacing, and data Security based on digital
media objects. In order to make the CNN description and its gradient flow
complete, for all presented applications, the symbolic representations of
mathematically defined loss/gain functions and gradient flow equations for all
used core units, are given. The tutorial is to convince the reader that STNN is

  Autoencoder","EMNLP 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to learn universal sentence representations, previous methods focus
on complex recurrent neural networks or supervised learning. In this paper, we
propose a mean-max attention autoencoder (mean-max AAE) within the
encoder-decoder framework. Our autoencoder rely entirely on the MultiHead
self-attention mechanism to reconstruct the input sequence. In the encoding we
propose a mean-max strategy that applies both mean and max pooling operations
over the hidden vectors to capture diverse information of the input. To enable
the information to steer the reconstruction process dynamically, the decoder
performs attention over the mean-max representation. By training our model on a
large collection of unlabelled data, we obtain high-quality representations of
sentences. Experimental results on a broad range of 10 transfer tasks
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised single
methods, including the classical skip-thoughts and the advanced
skip-thoughts+LN model. Furthermore, compared with the traditional recurrent
neural network, our mean-max AAE greatly reduce the training time.

encodes the local smoothness prior structure underlying a hyper-spectral image
(HSI), for general HSI processing tasks. This term is calculated by assuming
identical and independent sparsity structures on all bands of gradient maps
calculated along spatial and spectral HSI modes. This, however, is always
largely deviated from the real cases, where the gradient maps are generally
with different while correlated sparsity structures across all their bands.
Such deviation tends to hamper the performance of the related method by
adopting such prior term. To this is- sue, this paper proposes an enhanced 3DTV
(E-3DTV) regularization term beyond conventional 3DTV. Instead of imposing
sparsity on gradient maps themselves, the new term calculated sparsity on the
subspace bases on the gradient maps along their bands, which naturally encode
the correlation and difference across these bands, and more faithfully reflect
the insightful configurations of an HSI. The E-3DTV term can easily replace the
previous 3DTV term and be em- bedded into an HSI processing model to ameliorate
its performance. The superiority of the proposed methods is substantiated by
extensive experiments on two typical related tasks: HSI denoising and
compressed sensing, as compared with state-of-the-arts designed for both tasks.

estimating the right tail probability of a sum of continuous random variables
based on a change of variables to $L^1$ polar coordinates in which the radial
and angular components of the IS distribution are considered separately.
  When the asymptotic behaviour of the sum is known we exploit it for the
radial change of measure, and the resulting estimator has the appealing form of
the (known) asymptotic multiplied by a random multiplicative correction factor.
Given we assume knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of the sum in this
framework, traditional notions of efficiency that appear in the rare-event
literature hold little practical meaning here. Instead, we focus on the
practical behaviour of the proposed estimator in the pre-asymptotic regime for
right tail probabilities between roughly $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-7}$.
  The proposed estimator and procedure are applicable in both the heavy- and
light-tailed settings, as well as for independent and dependent summands. In
the case of independent summands, we find that our estimator compares
favourably with exponential tilting (iid light-tailed summands) and the
Asmussen--Kroese method (independent subexponential summands).
  However, for dependent subexponential summands using the same simple angular
distribution as for the independent case, the performance of our estimator
rapidly degenerates with increasing dimension, suggesting an open avenue for
further research.

shock. While previous work suggested this mechanism can reproduce the observed
Larson relation between velocity dispersion and size scale ($\sigma \propto
L^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma \approx 0.5$), the effects of self-gravity and
magnetic fields were not considered. We run a series of smoothed particle
magnetohydrodynamics experiments, passing clumpy gas through a shock in the
presence of a combination of self-gravity and magnetic fields. We find powerlaw
relations between $\sigma$ and $L$ throughout, with indices ranging from
$\Gamma=0.3-1.2$. These results are relatively insensitive to the strength and
geometry of magnetic fields, provided that the shock is relatively strong.
$\Gamma$ is strongly sensitive to the angle between the gas' bulk velocity and
the shock front, and the shock strength (compared to the gravitational
boundness of the pre-shock gas). If the origin of the $\sigma-L$ relation is in
clumpy shocks, deviations from the standard Larson relation constrain the
strength and behaviour of shocks in spiral galaxies.

Settling effects are seen at the lowest bulk Reynolds number $Re_{2H}\approx$

significantly larger than that of single-phase duct flow at the lower $Re_{2H}$

trade-off between the relative fluctuation of arbitrary currents and the
dissipation, has been found for various Markovian systems. However, this
relation has not been revealed for non-Markovian systems. Thus, we investigate
the thermodynamic uncertainty relation for time-delayed Langevin systems.
First, we demonstrate numerically that the conventional uncertainty relation
does not hold in certain delayed systems, which suggests that the lower bound
should be refined to sustain the validity of the inequality. By introducing
generalized total dissipation equal to the total entropy production in the
absence of time delay, we find that an analogous uncertainty relation exists
for such systems. Specifically, we prove that the fluctuation of arbitrary
currents at a steady state is constrained by the generalized total dissipation
for a finite observation time. The rate of this generalized quantity is always
positive and bounded from below by the square of arbitrary currents in the
system. This uncertainty relation can be considered generalized one, which
reduces to a conventional inequality for non-delayed Langevin systems. We
verify the derived uncertainty relation numerically and demonstrate its
validity in the Brusselator system, periodic Brownian motion, and a simple
two-dimensional model.

collisions, and their number is preserved throughout the subsequent evolution
of the system. Therefore, they constitute ideal probes for characterising the
Quark--Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium and for the study of its transport properties.
In particular, heavy quarks interact with the partonic constituents of the
plasma, losing energy, and are expected to be sensitive to the medium
collective motion induced by its hydrodynamical evolution. In pp collisions,
the measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides a reference for
heavy-ion studies, and allows also testing perturbative QCD calculations in a
wide range of collision energies. Similar studies in p--Pb collisions help in
disentangling cold nuclear matter effects from modifications induced by the
presence of a QGP medium, and are also useful to investigate the possible
existence of collective phenomena also in this system. The ALICE detector
provides excellent performances in terms of particle identification and
vertexing capabilities. Hence, it is fully suited for the reconstruction of
charmed mesons and baryons and of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at
central rapidity. Furthermore, the ALICE muon spectrometer allows
reconstructing heavy-flavour decay muons at forward rapidity. A review of the
main ALICE results on open heavy flavour production in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb
collisions is presented. Recent, more differential measurements are also shown,
including azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavour particles with charged
hadrons in p--Pb collisions, and D-meson tagged-jet production in p--Pb and
Pb--Pb collisions.

Lagrangian by a generalized CP transformation (labeled by a mixing parameter
$\theta$) on the left-chiral flavor neutrino fields. We investigate its
implications for leptonic CP violation and neutrino phenomenology in general.
Interestingly, the $\mu\tau$ mixing parameter $\theta$ gets correlated with the
Dirac CP phase $\delta$ and the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ through
an analytical relation. In general, for arbitrary $\theta$, both $\theta_{23}$
and $\delta$ are nonmaximal. We discuss the corresponding results for the CP
asymmetry parameter $A_{\mu e}$ in neutrino oscillation experiments. For a
nonmaximal $\delta$, one of the two Majorana phases is different from $0$ or
$\pi$, thereby leading to nonvanishing Majorana CP violation with observable
consequences for the neutrinoless double beta ($\beta\beta0\nu$) decay process.
We numerically work out in detail the predictions for that process in relation
to various ongoing and forthcoming experiments. We also work out the
predictions of our scheme on flavor flux ratios at neutrino telescopes. While
exact CP transformed $\mu\tau$ interchange antisymmetry ($\theta=\pi/2$) leads
to an exact equality among those ratios, taking a value $0.5$, a tiny deviation
can cause a drastic change in them. Careful measurement of these flux ratios in
future will further constrain the parameter $\theta$.

regions containing few tens of thousands stars with known phase space
coordinates. The central idea of the method is to calculate orbital arcs for
each star within a given region for a certain parametrised potential
(gravitational acceleration) and to assume that position of each star on its
orbital arc is a random variable with a uniform probability density in time.
Thereafter, by combining individual probability densities of stars it is
possible to calculate the overall probability density distribution and
likelihood for a given region as a function of gravitational acceleration
parameters. The likelihood has a maximum if the calculated probability
distribution and the observed distribution of stars in phase space are
consistent. This allows us to constrain gravitational accelerations and
potential gradient values. The method assumes that phases of stars are mixed
within the regions where stellar orbits are calculated. We tested the method
for 12 small rectangular regions within simulated disc galaxy from Gaia Wiki.
Tests show that even with a rather simple acceleration form the calculated
accelerations in galactic plane coincide with their true values from simulation
about 5 per cent, misalignment between the calculated and true acceleration
vector directions is less than 1 degree (median values). The model can be used
with the Milky Way Gaia complete solution data.

of the two most promising explanations is based upon the different effects of
the strong Lorentz scalar and vector mean fields known to exist in a nucleus on
the internal structure of the nucleon-like clusters which occupy shell model
states. The second links the effect to the modification of the structure of
nucleons involved in short-range correlations, which are far off their mass

complementary information on this puzzle, especially the spin-dependent EMC
effect and the isovector EMC effect, both proposed by Cloet, Bentz and Thomas.
It is shown that the predictions for the spin dependent EMC effect, in
particular, differ substantially within the mean-field and short-range
correlation approaches. Hence the measurement of the spin dependent EMC effect
at Jefferson Lab should give us a deeper understanding of the origin of the EMC
effect and, indeed, of the structure of atomic nuclei.

(IIoT) scenarios. Within 6TiSCH, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been
identified as means of providing centralized control in a number of key
situations. However, implementing a centralized SDN architecture in a Low Power
and Lossy Network (LLN) faces considerable challenges: not only is controller
traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention, but
the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other
traffic. This paper proposes using 6TiSCH tracks, a Layer-2 slicing mechanism
for creating dedicated forwarding paths across TSCH networks, in order to
isolate the SDN control overhead. Not only does this prevent control traffic
from affecting the performance of other data flows, but the properties of
6TiSCH tracks allows deterministic, low-latency SDN controller communication.
Using our own lightweight SDN implementation for Contiki OS, we firstly
demonstrate the effect of SDN control traffic on application data flows across
a 6TiSCH network. We then show that by slicing the network through the
allocation of dedicated resources along a SDN control path, tracks provide an
effective means of mitigating the cost of SDN control overhead in IEEE

handle cooperative problems in continuous action cooperative Markov games
effectively. The effectiveness of SCC-rFMQ is experimentally demonstrated on

novo protein design and in fitting electron microscopy maps. Here, we present a
tool for performing this modular decomposition using the Infomap community
detection algorithm. The protein structure is abstracted into a network in
which its amino acids are the nodes, and where the edges are generated using a
simple proximity test. Infomap can then be used to identify highly
intra-connected regions of the protein. We perform this decomposition
systematically across 4000 distinct protein structures, taken from the Protein
Data Bank. The decomposition obtained correlates well with existing PFAM
sequence classifications, but has the advantage of spanning the full protein,
with the potential for novel domains. The coarse-grained network formed by the
communities can also be used as a proxy for protein topology at the
single-chain level; we demonstrate that grouping these proteins by their
coarse-grained network results in a functionally significant classification.

matter power spectrum at intermediate and small scales which could be probed by
galaxy clustering and/or weak lensing observables. This effect happens at
scales that are also influenced by baryon feedback, i.e. galactic winds or
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback, which in realistic hydrodynamic
simulations has also been shown to produce a suppression of power. Leaving
aside, for the moment, the complex issue of galaxy bias, we focus here on
matter clustering and tomographic weak lensing, we investigate the possible
degeneracy between baryon feedback and neutrinos showing that it is not likely
to degrade significantly the measurement of neutrino mass in future surveys. To
do so, we generate mock data sets and fit them using the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) technique and explore degeneracies between feedback parameters and
neutrino mass. We model baryon feedback through fitting functions, while
massive neutrinos are accounted for, also in the non-linear regime, using
Halofit calibrated against accurate N-body neutrino simulations. In the error
budget, we include the uncertainty in the modelling of non-linearities. For
both matter clustering and weak lensing, we always recover the input neutrino
mass within $\sim 0.25\sigma$ confidence level. Finally, we also take into
account the intrinsic alignment effect in the weak lensing mock data. Even in
this case, we are able to recover the right parameters: in particular, we find
a significant degeneracy pattern between $M_\nu$ and the intrinsic alignment
parameter $A_\mathrm{IA}$ .

usual Bayesian generalized linear model to multiple dependent variables through
the factorisation of the joint probability distribution of the underlying

is of crucial importance. If an inadequate prior - like a too weakly
informative one - is used, data separation and data sparsity lead to issues in
the model selection process. In this work a simulation study between two weakly

use a zero mean Gaussian prior with a large variance, currently implemented in
the R-package abn. The second prior belongs to the Student's t-distribution,
specifically designed for logistic regressions and, finally, the strongly
informative prior is again Gaussian with mean equal to true parameter value and
a small variance. We compare the impact of these priors on the accuracy of the
learned additive Bayesian network in function of different parameters. We
create a simulation study to illustrate Lindley's paradox based on the prior

addressed in previous works is whether neural network decoders can handle 2D

answer for the toric code. The structure of our neural network decoder is
inspired by the renormalization group decoder. With a fairly strict policy on
training time, when the bit-flip error rate is lower than $9\%$ and syndrome
extraction is perfect, the neural network decoder performs better when code
distance increases. With a less strict policy, we find it is not hard for the
neural decoder to achieve a performance close to the minimum-weight perfect

$d=64$. Last but not least, we describe and analyze a few failed approaches.

dense gas in molecular clouds have quasi-universal properties on star
formation, and observational studies of extra galaxies have shown a
galactic-scale correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and surface
density of molecular gas. To reach a comprehensive understanding of both
properties, it is important to quantify the fractional mass of the dense gas in
molecular clouds f_DG. In particular, for the Milky Way (MW), there are no
previous studies resolving the f_DG disk over a scale of several kpc. In this
study, the f_DG was measured over 5kpc in the first quadrant of the MW, based
on the CO J=1-0 data in l=10-50 deg obtained as part of the FOREST Unbiased
Galactic Plane Imaging Survey with the Nobeyama 45-m Telescope (FUGIN) project.
The total molecular mass was measured using 12CO, and the dense gas mass was
estimated using C18O. The fractional masses including f_DG in the region within
~30% of the distances to the tangential points of the Galactic rotation (e.g.,
the Galactic Bar, Far-3kpc Arm, Norma Arm, Scutum Arm, Sagittarius Arm, and
inter-arm regions) were measured. As a result, an averaged f_DG of
2.9^{+2.6}_{-2.6} % was obtained for the entirety of the target region. This
low value suggests that dense gas formation is the primary factor of
inefficient star formation in galaxies. It was also found that the f_DG shows
large variations depending on the structures in the MW disk. The f_DG in the
Galactic arms were estimated to be ~4-5%, while those in the bar and inter-arm
regions were as small as ~0.1-0.4%. These results indicate that the
formation/destruction processes of the dense gas and their timescales are
different for different regions in the MW, leading to the differences in SFRs.

tenor versus lending at a longer tenor (""roll-over risk""), we construct a
stochastic model framework for the term structure of interest rates in which a
frequency basis (i.e. a spread applied to one leg of a swap to exchange one
floating interest rate for another of a different tenor in the same currency)
arises endogenously. This rollover risk consists of two components, a credit
risk component due to the possibility of being downgraded and thus facing a
higher credit spread when attempting to roll over short-term borrowing, and a
component reflecting the (systemic) possibility of being unable to roll over
short-term borrowing at the reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) due to an absence of
liquidity in the market. The modelling framework is of ""reduced form"" in the
sense that (similar to the credit risk literature) the source of credit risk is
not modelled (nor is the source of liquidity risk). However, the framework has
more structure than the literature seeking to simply model a different term
structure of interest rates for each tenor frequency, since relationships
between rates for all tenor frequencies are established based on the modelled
roll-over risk. We proceed to consider a specific case within this framework,
where the dynamics of interest rate and roll-over risk are driven by a
multifactor Cox/Ingersoll/Ross-type process, show how such model can be
calibrated to market data, and used for relative pricing of interest rate
derivatives, including bespoke tenor frequencies not liquidly traded in the

abundances for a sample of eight early-type slow rotators in Cygnus OB2 in
order to check possible inhomogeneities across the whole association and
whether there exists a correlation of chemical composition with Galactic
longitude. We have performed a spectroscopic analysis of a sample of late O and
early B stars with low rotational velocity, which have been chosen so as to
cover the whole association area. We have carried out an analysis based on
equivalent widths of metal lines, the wings of the H Balmer lines and FASTWIND
stellar atmosphere models to determine their stellar fundamental parameters as
well as the silicon and oxygen surface abundances. We derive a rather
homogeneous distribution of silicon and oxygen abundances across the region,
with average values of 12+log(Si/H)=7.53$\pm$0.08 dex and
12+log(O/H)=8.65$\pm$0.12 dex. We find a homogeneous chemical composition in
Cygnus OB2 with no clear evidence for significant chemical self-enrichment,
despite indications of strong stellar winds and possible supernovae during the
history of the region. Comparison with different scenarios of chemical
enrichment by stellar winds and supernovae point to star forming efficiencies
not significantly above 10%. The degree of homogeneity that we find is
consistent with the observed Milky Way oxygen gradient based on HII regions. We
also find that the oxygen scatter within Cygnus OB2 is at least of the same
order than among HII regions at similar Galactocentric distance.

during consecutive process executions under optimal control via reinforcement
learning, using the measured product quality as reward after each process

algorithms from model predictive control and approximate dynamic programming,
is therefore obsolete. This avoids several difficulties namely in system

Instead of using pre-created process and observation models, value
function-based reinforcement learning algorithms build functions of expected

expectation functions are learned online, by interacting with the process. The
proposed algorithm takes stochastic variations of the process conditions into
account and is able to cope with partial observability. A Q-learning-based
method for adaptive optimal control of partially observable episodic
fixed-horizon manufacturing processes is developed and studied. The resulting

classification with application to home security, medical diagnosis,
rehabilitation and assisted living. Aiming at identifying changes in gait
patterns based on radar micro-Doppler signatures, this work is concerned with
solving the intra motion category classification problem of gait recognition.
Methods: New gait classification approaches utilizing physical features,
subspace features and sum-of-harmonics modeling are presented and their
performances are evaluated using experimental K-band radar data of four test
subjects. Five different gait classes are considered for each person, including
normal, pathological and assisted walks. Results: The proposed approaches are
shown to outperform existing methods for radar-based gait recognition which
utilize physical features from the cadence-velocity data representation domain
as in this paper. The analyzed gait classes are correctly identified with an
average accuracy of 93.8%, where a classification rate of 98.5% is achieved for
a single gait class. When applied to new data of another individual a
classification accuracy on the order of 80% can be expected. Conclusion: Radar
micro-Doppler signatures and their Fourier transforms are well suited to
capture changes in gait. Five different walking styles are recognized with high
accuracy. Significance: Radar-based sensing of human gait is an emerging
technology with multi-faceted applications in security and health care
industries. We show that radar, as a contact-less sensing technology, can
supplement existing gait diagnostic tools with respect to long-term monitoring
and reproducibility of the examinations.

promising performance on abstractive document summarization. However, they
still have some issues that limit their performance, especially while deal-ing
with long sequences. One of the issues is that, to the best of our knowledge,
all current models employ a unidirectional decoder, which reasons only about
the past and still limited to retain future context while giving a prediction.
This makes these models suffer on their own by generating unbalanced outputs.
Moreover, unidirec-tional attention-based document summarization can only
capture partial aspects of attentional regularities due to the inherited
challenges in document summarization. To this end, we propose an end-to-end
trainable bidirectional RNN model to tackle the aforementioned issues. The
model has a bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture; in which the encoder
and the decoder are bidirectional LSTMs. The forward decoder is initialized
with the last hidden state of the backward encoder while the backward decoder
is initialized with the last hidden state of the for-ward encoder. In addition,
a bidirectional beam search mechanism is proposed as an approximate inference
algo-rithm for generating the output summaries from the bidi-rectional model.
This enables the model to reason about the past and future and to generate
balanced outputs as a result. Experimental results on CNN / Daily Mail dataset
show that the proposed model outperforms the current abstractive
state-of-the-art models by a considerable mar-gin.

rapid acquisition and improved image quality but require iterative
reconstruction schemes with regularization to enforce sparsity. Regardless of
the difficulty in obtaining a fast numerical solution, the total variation (TV)
regularization is a preferred choice due to its edge-preserving and structure
recovery capabilities. While many approaches have been proposed to overcome the
non-differentiability of the TV cost term, an iterative shrinkage based
formulation allows recovering an image through recursive application of linear
filtering and soft thresholding. However, providing an optimal setting for the
regularization parameter is critical due to its direct impact on the rate of
convergence as well as steady state error. In this paper, a regularizer
adaptively varying in the derivative space is proposed, that follows the
generalized discrepancy principle (GDP). The implementation proceeds by
adaptively reducing the discrepancy level expressed as the absolute difference
between TV norms of the consistency error and the sparse approximation error. A
criterion based on the absolute difference between TV norms of consistency and
sparse approximation errors is used to update the threshold. Application of the
adaptive shrinkage TV regularizer to CS recovery of parallel MRI (pMRI) and
temporal gradient adaptation in dynamic MRI are shown to result in improved
image quality with accelerated convergence. In addition, the adaptive TV-based
iterative shrinkage (ATVIS) provides a significant speed advantage over the
fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA).

There exist theories beyond general relativity (GR) which modify gravity in the

holes are believed to be described by the Kerr metric and serve as suitable
candidates to test strong gravity with electromagnetic radiation. We perform
such a test by fitting one Suzaku dataset of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
galaxy Mrk 335 with X-ray reflection spectroscopy, using the Johannsen metric
to model the black hole spacetime and test for deviations from Kerr. We find
the data is best modeled with a hybrid model that includes both partial
covering absorption and a reflection component. This is the first time such a
model has been proposed for a high-flux (low reflection) Mrk 335 dataset. We
constrain the Johannsen deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ to
$-1.5<\alpha_{13}<0.6$ with spin parameter $a_{*}>0.8$, and the $\alpha_{22}$
parameter to $-0.4<\alpha_{22}<2.1$ with $a_{*}>0.7$, both at the 99%
confidence level. Although additional solutions at large deviations from the
Kerr metric show statistical similarity with the ones above, further analysis
suggests these solutions may be manifestations of uncertainties beyond our

models predict bacterial cell death for physiologically high light intensities.
To resolve this discrepancy, we consider a unified framework to describe three
stages of photosynthesis in natural conditions, namely light absorption,
exciton transfer and charge separation dynamics, to investigate the
relationship between the statistical features of thermal light and the Quinol
production in bacterial photosynthesis. This approach allows us to identify a
mechanism of photoprotection that relies on charge recombination facilitated by
the photon bunching statistics characteristic of thermal sunlight. Our results
suggest that the flexible design underpinning natural photosynthesis may
therefore rely on exploiting the temporal correlations of thermal light,
manifested in photo-bunching patterns, which are preserved for excitations
reaching the reaction center.

driver's reaction time (RT) in response to the appearance of a potential hazard
warrants urgent research. In the last two decades, the electric field that is
generated by the activities in the brain, monitored by an electroencephalogram
(EEG), has been proven to be a robust physiological indicator of human
behavior. However, mapping the human brain can be extremely challenging,
especially owing to the variability in human beings over time, both within and
among individuals. Factors such as fatigue, inattention and stress can induce
homeostatic changes in the brain, which affect the observed relationship
between brain dynamics and behavioral performance, and thus make the existing
systems for predicting RT difficult to generalize. To solve this problem, an
ensemble-based weighted prediction system is presented herein. This system
comprises a set of prediction submodels that are individually trained using
groups of data with similar EEG-RT relationships. To obtain a final prediction,
the prediction outcomes of the sub-models are then multiplied by weights that
are derived from the EEG alpha coherences of 10 channels plus theta band powers
of 30 channels, whose changes were found to be indicators of variations in the
EEG-RT relationship. The results thus obtained reveal that the proposed system
with a time-varying adaptive weighting mechanism significantly outperforms the
conventional system in modeling a driver's RT. The adaptive design of the
proposed system demonstrates its feasibility in coping with the variability in
the brain-behavior relationship. In this contribution surprisingly simple
EEG-based adaptive methods are used in combination with an ensemble scheme to
significantly increase system performance.

a strong increase in expected quality of life of patients.

fundamental understanding of these effects becomes increasingly important for
clinical applications. The phenomenon-based MultiScale Approach to the physics
of radiation damage with ions (MSA) provides a tool for a molecular-level
understanding of physical and chemical mechanisms of radiation biodamage and
allows to quantify macroscopic biological effects caused by ion irradiation.
This study reports the first application of the MSA for the analysis of RBE of
ion beams. As a case study, we quantify the response of human normal tissue
cell lines to carbon-ion irradiation at different values of linear energy
transfer. RBE corresponding to different biological endpoints as well as other
radiobiological parameters, such as clonogenic cell survival as a function of
dose and inactivation cross section, are analyzed and compared with
experimental data. Good agreement with an extensive data set emphasizes the
predictive power of the MSA. The method is also used to make predictions of RBE
at high values of LET where RBE decreases due to the ""overkill"" effect. In this
regime, the dose needed to achieve a given biological effect is deposited by a
few ions. The fact that a given number of ions may produce more damage than
needed for a given effect leads to a significant (up to 20%) variation in RBE.
This effect should be taken into consideration in the analysis of experimental

interest in genetic population and comparative genomics research. Bubbles
discovery in multi-genomes coloured de bruijn graph for de novo genome assembly
is a problem that can be translated to cycles enumeration in graph theory.
Cycle enumerations algorithms in big and complex de Bruijn graphs are time
consuming. Specialised fast algorithms for efficient bubble search are needed
for coloured de bruijn graph variant calling applications. In coloured de
Bruijn graphs, bubble paths coverages are used in downstream variants calling
analysis. Results: In this paper, we introduce a fast parallel graph search for
different K-mer cycle sizes. Coloured path coverages are used for SNP
prediction. The graph search method uses a combined multi-node and multi-core
design to speeds up cycles enumeration. The search algorithm uses an index
extracted from the raw assembly of a coloured de Bruijn graph stored in a hash
table. The index is distributed across different CPU-cores, in a shared memory
HPC compute node, to build undirected subgraphs then search independently and
simultaneously specific cycle sizes. This same index can also be split between
several HPC compute nodes to take advantage of as many CPU-cores available to
the user. The local neighbourhood parallel search approach reduces the graph's
complexity and facilitate cycles search of a multi-colour de Bruijn graph. The
search algorithm is incorporated into $\Pi$-cyc application and tested on a
number of Schizosaccharomyces Pombe genomes. Availability: $\Pi$-cyc is an

flat region or shallow minimum at its center surrounded by potential walls and
multiple symmetry related index one saddle points that allow entrance and exit
from this intermediate region.We have discovered four qualitatively distinct
cases of the structure of the phase space that govern phase space transport.
These cases are categorized according to the total energy and the stability of
the periodic orbits associated with the family of the central minimum, the
bifurcations of the same family, and the energetic accessibility of the index
one saddles. In each case we have computed the invariant manifolds of the
unstable periodic orbits of the central region of the potential and the
invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits of the families of periodic
orbits associated with the index one saddles. We have found that there are
three distinct mechanisms determined by the invariant manifold structure of the
unstable periodic orbits govern the phase space transport. The first mechanism
explains the nature of the entrance of the trajectories from the region of the
low energy saddles into the caldera and how they may become trapped in the
central region of the potential. The second mechanism describes the trapping of
the trajectories that begin from the central region of the caldera, their
transport to the regions of the saddles, and the nature of their exit from the

better than the most common alternatives when all the attributes are
real-valued. Rotation forest is a tree based ensemble that performs transforms
on subsets of attributes prior to constructing each tree. We present an
empirical comparison of classifiers for problems with only real-valued
features. We evaluate classifiers from three families of algorithms: support
vector machines; tree-based ensembles; and neural networks tuned with a large
grid search. We compare classifiers on unseen data based on the quality of the
decision rule (using classification error) the ability to rank cases (area
under the receiver operating characteristic) and the probability estimates
(using negative log likelihood). We conclude that, in answer to the question
posed in the title, yes, rotation forest is significantly more accurate on
average than competing techniques when compared on three distinct sets of
datasets. Further, we assess the impact of the design features of rotation
forest through an ablative study that transforms random forest into rotation
forest. We identify the major limitation of rotation forest as its scalability,
particularly in number of attributes. To overcome this problem we develop a
model to predict the train time of the algorithm and hence propose a contract
version of rotation forest where a run time cap is imposed {\em a priori}. We
demonstrate that on large problems rotation forest can be made an order of
magnitude faster without significant loss of accuracy. We also show that there
is no real benefit (on average) from tuning rotation forest. We maintain that
without any domain knowledge to indicate an algorithm preference, rotation
forest should be the default algorithm of choice for problems with continuous
attributes.

the motion model between image pairs. These constraints can be roughly divided
into two categories: geometric constraints and photometric constraints. In this
paper, geometric and photometric constraints are combined to improve the
alignment quality, which is based on the observation that these two kinds of
constraints are complementary. On the one hand, geometric constraints (e.g.,
point and line correspondences) are usually spatially biased and are
insufficient in some extreme scenes, while photometric constraints are always
evenly and densely distributed. On the other hand, photometric constraints are
sensitive to displacements and are not suitable for images with large
parallaxes, while geometric constraints are usually imposed by feature matching
and are more robust to handle parallaxes. The proposed method therefore
combines them together in an efficient mesh-based image warping framework. It
achieves better alignment quality than methods only with geometric constraints,
and can handle larger parallax than photometric-constraint-based method.
Experimental results on various images illustrate that the proposed method
outperforms representative state-of-the-art image stitching methods reported in
the literature.

constructed with sub-linear complexity by the use of partial orderings. In this

maintained. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of noise strength and
measurement strength on the degree of precise quantum control. Crucially, the
measurement-feedback scheme is quite universal in that it can be applied to
precise quantum control for any dimension systems. Thus, it naturally finds
extensive applications in quantum information processing.

However, the interplay between the adhesion interactions, dynamical shape

understanding of cell motility and morphology, we develop a theory using
stochastic quantization method that describes the role of biophysical cues in
regulating diverse cell motility. We show that the cumulative effect of time
dependent adhesion interactions that determine the structural rearrangements
and self-generated force due to actin remodeling, dictate the super-diffusive
motion of mesenchymal phenotype in the absence of flow. Interstitial flows
regulate cell motility phenotype and promote the amoeboid over mesenchymal
motility through adhesion interactions. Cells exhibit a dynamical slowing down
of collective migration, with a decreasing degree of super-diffusion.
Mesenchymal cells are more persistent and diffusive compared to amoeboid cells.
Our findings, suggest a mechanism of Interstitial flow induced directed motion

  proceedings of ICALP 2019",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM cs.MA math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A classical multi-agent fence patrolling problem asks: What is the maximum
length $L$ of a line that $k$ agents with maximum speeds $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ can
patrol if each point on the line needs to be visited at least once every unit
of time. It is easy to see that $L = \alpha \sum_{i=1}^k v_i$ for some
efficiency $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2},1)$. After a series of works giving better
and better efficiencies, it was conjectured that the best possible efficiency
approaches $\frac{2}{3}$. No upper bounds on the efficiency below $1$ were
known. We prove the first such upper bounds and tightly bound the optimal
efficiency in terms of the minimum ratio of speeds $s = {v_{\max}}/{v_{\min}}$
and the number of agents $k$. Guided by our upper bounds, we construct a scheme
whose efficiency approaches $1$, disproving the conjecture of Kawamura and
Soejima. Our scheme asymptotically matches our upper bounds in terms of the
maximal speed difference and the number of agents used, proving them to be
asymptotically tight.
  A variation of the fence patrolling problem considers a circular fence
instead and asks for its circumference to be maximized. We consider the
unidirectional case of this variation, where all agents are only allowed to
move in one direction, say clockwise. At first, a strategy yielding $L =
\max_{r \in [k]} r \cdot v_r$ where $v_1 \geq v_2 \geq \dots \geq v_k$ was
conjectured to be optimal by Czyzowicz et al. This was proven not to be the
case by giving constructions for only specific numbers of agents with marginal
improvements of $L$. We give a general construction that yields $L =
\frac{1}{33 \log_e\log_2(k)} \sum_{i=1}^k v_i$ for any set of agents, which in
particular for the case $1, 1/2, \dots, 1/k$ diverges as $k \rightarrow

present study shows that they indeed develop the multifractal features, but
these features evolve through a variety of shapes, most often strongly

in the very early stage such as the disk formation stage because the growth
timescale of dust is shorter than the disk formation timescale if there is no
process to suppress the collisional growth of dust. We investigate the
possibility of planetesimal formation via direct collisional growth in the very
early stage of a protoplanetary disk. We show that, in the very early stage of
protoplanetary disks, icy dust aggregates suffer radial drift and deplete
without forming planetesimal-sized objects. This is because as the disk
temperature easily increases by the viscous heating in the disk formation
stage, the area where the dust can break through the radial drift barrier is
restricted only to the inside the snowline. This suggests that in the disk

autonomous robots use a receding-horizon strategy to plan trajectories, wherein
they execute a short plan while creating the next plan. However, creating safe,
dynamically-feasible trajectories in real time is challenging; and, planners
must ensure persistent feasibility, meaning a new trajectory is always
available before the previous one has finished executing. Existing approaches
make a tradeoff between model complexity and planning speed, which can require
sacrificing guarantees of safety and dynamic feasibility. This work presents
the Reachability-based Trajectory Design (RTD) method for trajectory planning.
RTD begins with an offline Forward Reachable Set (FRS) computation of a robot's
motion when tracking parameterized trajectories; the FRS provably bounds
tracking error. At runtime, the FRS is used to map obstacles to parameterized
trajectories, allowing RTD to select a safe trajectory at every planning
iteration. RTD prescribes an obstacle representation to ensure that obstacle
constraints can be created and evaluated in real time while maintaining safety.
Persistent feasibility is achieved by prescribing a minimum sensor horizon and
a minimum duration for the planned trajectories. A system decomposition
approach is used to improve the tractability of computing the FRS, allowing RTD
to create more complex plans at runtime. RTD is compared in simulation with
Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees and Nonlinear Model-Predictive Control. RTD is
also demonstrated in randomly-crafted environments on two hardware platforms: a
differential-drive Segway, and a car-like Rover. The proposed method is safe
and persistently feasible across thousands of simulations and dozens of
real-world hardware demos.

local-realistic model. Although being stronger than classical correlations,
quantum correlations are limited by the Tsirelson bound. This bound, however,
applies for Hermitian, commutative operators corresponding to non-signaling
observables in Alice's and Bob's spacelike-separated labs. As an attempt to
explore theories beyond quantum mechanics and analyze the uniqueness of the
latter, we examine in this work the extent of non-local correlations when
relaxing these fundamental assumptions, which allows for theories with
non-local signaling. We prove that, somewhat surprisingly, the Tsirelson bound
in the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenario, and similarly other related
bounds on non-local correlations, remain effective as long as we maintain the
Hilbert space structure of the theory. Furthermore, in the case of Hermitian
observables we find novel relations between non-locality, local correlations,
and signaling. We demonstrate that such non-local signaling theories are
naturally simulated by quantum systems of parafermionic zero modes. We
numerically study the derived bounds in parafermionic systems, confirming the
bounds' validity yet finding a drastic difference between correlations of
'signaling' and 'non-signaling' sets of observables. We also propose an
experimental procedure for measuring the relevant correlations.

sliding window across each series, discretising the window to form a word,
forming a histogram of word counts over the dictionary, then constructing a
classifier on the histograms. A recent evaluation of two of this type of
algorithm, Bag of Patterns (BOP) and Bag of Symbolic Fourier Approximation
Symbols (BOSS) found a significant difference in accuracy between these
seemingly similar algorithms. We investigate this phenomenon by deconstructing
the classifiers and measuring the relative importance of the four key
components between BOP and BOSS. We find that whilst ensembling is a key
component for both algorithms, the effect of the other components is mixed and
more complex. We conclude that BOSS represents the state of the art for
dictionary based TSC. Both BOP and BOSS can be classed as bag of words
approaches. These are particularly popular in Computer Vision for tasks such as
image classification. Converting approaches from vision requires careful
engineering. We adapt three techniques used in Computer Vision for TSC: Scale
Invariant Feature Transform; Spatial Pyramids; and Histrogram Intersection. We
find that using Spatial Pyramids in conjunction with BOSS (SP) produces a
significantly more accurate classifier. SP is significantly more accurate than
standard benchmarks and the original BOSS algorithm. It is not significantly
worse than the best shapelet based approach, and is only outperformed by
HIVE-COTE, an ensemble that includes BOSS as a constituent module.

control, several examples of electronic devices based on Dirac fermion dynamics
have been demonstrated, including Klein tunneling, negative refraction and

analogous Dirac-fermion-optics (DFO), in which the angle dependence of Klein
tunneling is explicitly utilized to build tunable collimators and reflectors

device, separating the classical contribution from that of any disorder in the
channel. Since the DFO quantum switch demonstrated in this work requires no
explicit energy gap, the switching operation is expected to be robust against
thermal fluctuations and inhomogeneity length scales comparable to the Fermi
wavelength. We find our quantum switch works at an elevated temperature up to
230 K and large bias current density up to 102 A/m, over a wide range of

conditional on vertex degrees in unweighted graphs, and sampling conditional on

the presence or absence of an arbitrary number of edges. The resulting
conditional distributions provide the basis for exact tests. Existing samplers
based on MCMC or sequential importance sampling are generally not scalable;
their efficiency degrades in sparse graphs. MCMC methods usually require
explicit computation of a Markov basis to navigate the complex state space;
this is computationally intensive even for small graphs. We use state-dependent
kernel selection to develop new MCMC samplers. These do not require a Markov
basis, and are efficient both in sparse and dense graphs. The key idea is to
intelligently select a Markov kernel on the basis of the current state of the
chain. We apply our methods to testing hypotheses on a real network and
contingency table. The algorithms appear orders of magnitude more efficient

noise in the form of a symmetric Gaussian $p$-tensor for $p\geq 3$ and signal
in the form of a symmetric low-rank random tensor. The latter is defined as a
linear combination of $k$ independent symmetric rank-one random tensors,
referred to as spikes, with weights referred to as signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). The entries of the vectors that determine the spikes are i.i.d. sampled
from general probability distributions supported on bounded subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$. This work focuses on the problem of detecting the presence of
these spikes, and establishes the phase transition of this detection problem
for any fixed $k \geq 1$. In particular, it shows that for a set of relatively
low SNRs it is impossible to distinguish between the spiked and non-spiked
Gaussian tensors. Furthermore, in the interior of the complement of this set,
where at least one of the $k$ SNRs is relatively high, these two tensors are
distinguishable by the likelihood ratio test. In addition, when the total
number of low-rank components, $k$, of the $p$-tensor of size $N$ grows in the
order $o(N^{(p-2)/4})$ as $N$ tends to infinity, the problem exhibits an
analogous phase transition. This theory for spike detection is also shown to
imply that recovery of the spikes by the minimum mean square error exhibits the
same phase transition. The main methods used in this work arise from the study
of mean field spin glass models, where the phase transition thresholds are
identified as the critical inverse temperatures distinguishing the high and
low-temperature regimes of the free energies. In particular, our result
formulates the first full characterization of the high temperature regime for
vector-valued spin glass models with independent coordinates.

Under some circumstances, enlarging a few couplings of a Hamiltonian can
effectively detach a (possibly disjoint) block within the ground state. This
detachment is characterized by a sharp decrease in the entanglement entropy
between block and environment, and leads to an increase of the internal
correlations between the (possibly distant) sites of the block. We provide some
examples of this detachment in free fermionic systems. The first example is an
edge-dimerized chain, where the second and penultimate hoppings are increased.
In that case, the two extreme sites constitute a block which disentangles from
the rest of the chain. Further examples are given by (a) a superlattice which
can be detached from a 1D chain, and (b) a star-graph, where the extreme sites
can be detached or not depending on the presence of an external magnetic field,
in analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We characterize these detached blocks
by their reduced matrices, specially through their entanglement spectrum and
entanglement Hamiltonian.

computationally infeasible for large-scale problems. Although the existing

additional regularization yields tedious algorithmic parameters and pessimistic
convergence rates with conservative step sizes. To address the limitations of
existing methods, we thus develop a provable nonconvex demixing procedure
viaWirtinger flow, much like vanilla gradient descent, to harness the benefits
of regularization-free fast convergence rate with aggressive step size and

trilinear scalar couplings) as well as the dimensionless quartic scalar
couplings. There are two sources for these discrepancies. Firstly, the known
expressions for the scalar couplings assume a diagonal wave-function
renormalisation which is not appropriate for models with mixing in the scalar
sector. Secondly, the dimensionful parameters have been derived in the
literature using a dummy field method which we critically re-examine, obtaining
revised expressions for the $\beta$-function of the fermion mass. We perform an
independent cross-check using well-tested supersymmetric RGEs which confirms
our results. The numerical impact of the changes in the $\beta$-function for
the fermion mass terms is illustrated using a toy model with a heavy
vector-like fermion pair coupled to a scalar gauge singlet. Unsurprisingly, the
correction to the running of the fermion mass becomes sizeable for large Yukawa
couplings of the order of O(1). Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of
the correction to the $\beta$-functions of the scalar quartic couplings using a

refraction has the potential to contaminate Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power
spectra of the 21~cm emission line of neutral hydrogen. The alteration of the
spatial and spectral structure of foreground measurements due to total electron
content (TEC) gradients in the ionosphere create a departure from the expected
sky signal. We present a general framework for understanding the signatures of
ionospheric behaviour in the two-dimensional (2D) neutral hydrogen power
spectrum measured by a low-frequency radio interferometer. Two primary classes
of ionospheric behaviour are considered, corresponding to dominant modes
observed in Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) EoR data; namely, anisotropic
structured wave behaviour, and isotropic turbulence. Analytic predictions for
power spectrum bias due to this contamination are computed, and compared with
simulations. We then apply the ionospheric metric described in Jordan et al.
(2017) to study the impact of ionospheric structure on MWA data, by dividing
MWA EoR datasets into classes with good and poor ionospheric conditions, using
sets of matched 30-minute observations from 2014 September. The results are
compared with the analytic and simulated predictions, demonstrating the
observed bias in the power spectrum when the ionosphere is active (displays
coherent structures or isotropic turbulence). The analysis demonstrates that
unless ionospheric activity can be quantified and corrected, active data should
not be included in EoR analysis in order to avoid systematic biases in
cosmological power spectra. When data are corrected with a model formed from
the calibration information, bias reduces below the expected 21~cm signal
level. Data are considered `quiet' when the median measured source position
offsets are less than 10-15~arcseconds.

pattern resembling the autocorrelation (we call it R-autocorrelation) of the
hidden object can be extracted. By performing numerical simulations and
experiments, we demonstrate that comparing with true autocorrelation, the
pattern of R-autocorrelation has a significantly lower background and higher
contrast, which enables better reconstructions of hidden objects, especially in
the case of broadband illumination, or even with white-light.

  Unstructured Meshes",,,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an extension of previous fourth-order compact gas kinetic scheme (GKS) on
structured meshes (Ji et al. 2018), this work is about the development of a
third-order compact GKS on unstructured meshes for the compressible Euler and
Navier-Stokes solutions. Based on the time accurate high-order gas-kinetic
evolution solution at a cell interface, the time dependent gas distribution
function in GKS provides not only the flux function and its time derivative at
a cell interface, but also the time accurate flow variables there at next time
level. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables inside
each control volume through the interface fluxes, the cell averaged first-order
spatial derivatives of flow variables in the cell can be also obtained using
the updated flow variables at the cell interfaces around that cell through the
divergence theorem.
  Therefore, with the flow variables and their first-order spatial derivatives
inside each cell, the Hermite WENO (HWENO) techniques can be naturally
implemented for the compact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of a new
time step.
  Following the reconstruction method in (Zhu et al. 2018), a new HWENO
reconstruction on triangular meshes is designed in the current scheme. Combined
with a two-stage temporal discretization and second-order gas-kinetic flux
function, a third-order spatial and temporal accuracy in the current compact
scheme can be achieved. Accurate solutions can be obtained for both inviscid
and viscous flows without sensitive dependence on the quality of triangular
meshes. The robustness of the scheme has been validated as well through the
cases with strong shocks in the hypersonic viscous flow simulations.

Then, this paper proves that the Chow-Liu algorithm finds the topology by
utilizing power flow equations and the conditional independence relationships
implied by the radial multi-phase structure of distribution grids with the
presence of incorrect bus phase labels. At last, by utilizing Carson's

Lagrangian of the field theory envisaged in our scenario contains a second
field $\chi$, for simplicity assumed to be a scalar, too. For fixed values of
$\chi$, the potential term decays exponentially at large positive values of
$\varphi$. While $\varphi$ is not coupled to Standard Model fields, $\chi$ is
assumed to be coupled to them, and the Green functions of $\chi$ depend on the
cosmological redshift in the expanding universe. We assume that the term in the
Lagrangian coupling $\chi$ to $\varphi$ is such that, at redshifts $z$ larger
than some critical redshift $z_c$, $\varphi$ is trapped near $\varphi=0$, and
oscillations of $\varphi$ about $\varphi=0$ describing massive scalar particles
give rise to Dark Matter. At redshifts below $z_c$, the field $\varphi$ is no
longer trapped near the origin and starts to `roll' towards large field values.
A homogenous component of $\varphi$ emerges that acts as Dark Energy. Within
over-dense regions, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, the redshifting of
$\chi$ stops, and $\varphi$ therefore remains trapped near $\varphi=0$ as long
as $z_c$ is smaller than the redshift when structures on galactic scales
decouple from the Hubble flow. Thus, at the present time, $\varphi$ describes
both Dark Energy and Dark Matter.

with a direct cascade of energy and an explosive inverse cascade of wave
action. In the latter case, we show numerically by computing the second-order
diffusion model that the non-stationary regime exhibits an anomalous scaling
which is understood as a self-similar solution of the second kind with a front
propagation following the law $k_f \sim (t_*-t)^{3.296}$, with $t<t_*$. These
results are relevant to better understand the dynamics of the primordial
universe where potent sources of gravitational waves may produce space-time

flows elucidate the balance between diffusion and segregation that can lead to

indicate that the collisional diffusion is essentially independent of
overburden pressure. Because the rate of segregation diminishes with overburden
pressure, the tendency for particles to segregate weakens relative to the
re-mixing of particles due to collisional diffusion as the overburden pressure
increases. Using a continuum approach that includes a pressure dependent
segregation velocity and a pressure independent diffusion coefficient, the
interplay between diffusion and segregation is accurately predicted for both
size and density bidisperse mixtures over a wide range of flow conditions when
compared to simulation results. Additional simulations with initially
segregated conditions demonstrate that applying a high enough overburden
pressure can suppress segregation to the point that collisional diffusion mixes

  Fluids",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A rest fluid displaced by a less viscous fluid in a porous medium triggers
the so-called Saffman-Taylor instability at their contact front and hence forms
complicated finger-like patterns. When the two fluids are miscible, the surface
tension at their contact front vanishes, leaving the variation in viscosity
dominant the contribution to the instability. The phenomena, named viscous
fingering, can be studied by the analogy of a single-phase flow in the
Hele-Shaw cell, a quasi-two-dimensional rectilinear plane. Viscous fingering
produces complex geometrical patterns. They are important not only in industry
but also in mathematics. Theoretical analyses on the evolution of the
finger-like patterns in miscible fluids are still expanding (it is referred to
the morphology of the flow patterns). Here we study the morphology of the
finger-like patterns within some simple concepts in differential geometry, in
which surfaces and curves are analog to the profiles of the concentration and
its contours, respectively. We thus can investigate the fingering phenomena
through the geometrical perspective in which various results in differential
geometry are immediately applicable.

recently demonstrated its potential for accurate diagnosis of human cervical

learning curve clinicians need to overcome to interpret OCM images. Developing
an intelligent technique for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to accurately
interpret OCM images will facilitate clinical adoption of the technology and
improve patient care. Methods: 497 high-resolution 3-D OCM volumes (600
cross-sectional images each) were collected from 159 ex vivo specimens of 92
female patients. OCM image features were extracted using a convolutional neural
network (CNN) model, concatenated with patient information (e.g., age, HPV
results), and classified using a support vector machine classifier. Ten-fold
cross-validations were utilized to test the performance of the CADx method in a
five-class classification task and a binary classification task. Results: An
88.3 plus or minus 4.9% classification accuracy was achieved for five
fine-grained classes of cervical tissue, namely normal, ectropion, low-grade
and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL), and cancer. In
the binary classification task (low-risk [normal, ectropion and LSIL] vs.
high-risk [HSIL and cancer]), the CADx method achieved an area-under-the-curve

method outperformed three human experts. It was also able to identify
morphological characteristics in OCM images that were consistent with
histopathological interpretations. Significance: Label-free OCM imaging,
combined with deep-learning based CADx methods, hold a great promise to be used
in clinical settings for the effective screening and diagnosis of cervical

modeled as rotlets, are non Hamiltonian in the bounded domain and produce
chaotic advection of fluid tracers in subsets of the domain. A complete
parametric investigation of the fluid mixing as a function of the initial
locations of the rotlets is performed based on pseudo phase portraits. The
mixing of fluid tracers as a function of relative positions of micro-rotors is
studied using finite time entropy and locational entropy. The finite time
locational entropy is used to identify regions of the fluid that produce good
vs poor mixing and this is visualized by the stretching and folding of blobs of
tracer particles. Unlike the case of the classic blinking vortex dynamics, the
velocity field of the flow modeled using rotlets inside a circular boundary is
smooth in time and satisfies the no slip boundary condition. This makes the
considered model a more realistic case for studies of mixing in microfluidic
devices using magnetic actuated microspheres.

artificial intelligence communities are facing at the moment, both in terms of
difficulty and potential societal impact. Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are
expected to prevent road accidents and save millions of lives while improving
the livelihood and life quality of many more. However, despite large interest
and a number of industry players working in the autonomous domain, there still
remains more to be done in order to develop a system capable of operating at a
level comparable to best human drivers. One reason for this is high uncertainty
of traffic behavior and large number of situations that an SDV may encounter on
the roads, making it very difficult to create a fully generalizable system. To
ensure safe and efficient operations, an autonomous vehicle is required to
account for this uncertainty and to anticipate a multitude of possible
behaviors of traffic actors in its surrounding. We address this critical
problem and present a method to predict multiple possible trajectories of
actors while also estimating their probabilities. The method encodes each
actor's surrounding context into a raster image, used as input by deep
convolutional networks to automatically derive relevant features for the task.
Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to state-of-the-art
baselines, the method was successfully tested on SDVs in closed-course tests.

voltammetry yielded significantly more accurate parameter values than the
equivalent dc approach. In this paper we build on this work to show that this
approach allows us, for the first time, to separate the effects of random
experimental noise and inherent system variability in voltammetric experiments.
We analyse ten repeated experimental data sets for the $[$Fe(CN)$_6]^{3-/ 4-}$
process, again using large-amplitude ac cyclic voltammetry. In each of the ten
cases we are able to obtain an extremely good fit to the experimental data and
obtain very narrow distributions of the recovered parameters governing both the
faradaic (the reversible formal faradaic potential, $E_0$, the standard
heterogeneous charge transfer rate constant $k_0$, and the charge transfer
coefficient $\alpha$) and non-faradaic terms (uncompensated resistance, $R_u$,
and double layer capacitance, $C_{dl}$). We then employ hierarchical Bayesian
methods to recover the underlying ""hyperdistribution"" of the faradaic and
non-faradaic parameters, showing that in general the variation between the
experimental data sets is significantly greater than suggested by individual
experiments, except for $\alpha$ where the inter-experiment variation was
relatively minor. Correlations between pairs of parameters are provided, and
for example, reveal a weak link between $k_0$ and $C_{dl}$ (surface activity of
a glassy carbon electrode surface). Finally, we discuss the implications of our
findings for voltammetric experiments more generally.
