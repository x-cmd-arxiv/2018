a local window function, $\phi(s-t)$, is a common model for a measurement
device whose resolution is substantially lower than that of the objects being
observed. Super-resolution concerns localising the point sources
$\{a_i,t_i\}_{i=1}^k$ with an accuracy beyond the essential support of
$\phi(s-t)$, typically from $m$ samples $y(s_j)=\sum_{i=1}^k
a_i\phi(s_j-t_i)+\eta_j$, where $\eta_j$ indicates an inexactness in the sample
value. We consider the setting of $x$ being non-negative and seek to
characterise all non-negative measures approximately consistent with the
samples. We first show that $x$ is the unique non-negative measure consistent
with the samples provided the samples are exact, i.e. $\eta_j=0$, $m\ge 2k+1$
samples are available, and $\phi(s-t)$ generates a Chebyshev system. This is
independent of how close the sample locations are and {\em does not rely on any
regulariser beyond non-negativity}; as such, it extends and clarifies the work
by Schiebinger et al. and De Castro et al., who achieve the same results but
require a total variation regulariser, which we show is unnecessary.
  Moreover, we characterise non-negative solutions $\hat{x}$ consistent with
the samples within the bound $\sum_{j=1}^m\eta_j^2\le \delta^2$. Any such
non-negative measure is within ${\mathcal O}(\delta^{1/7})$ of the discrete
measure $x$ generating the samples in the generalised Wasserstein distance,
converging to one another as $\delta$ approaches zero. We also show how to make
these general results, for windows that form a Chebyshev system, precise for
the case of $\phi(s-t)$ being a Gaussian window. The main innovation of these
results is that non-negativity alone is sufficient to localise point sources
beyond the essential sensor resolution.

equation failure at small lengthscales is a result of the failure of the
Poiseuille flowrate closure (the Reynolds equation is derived from a statement
of mass conservation, which is valid at all scales); second, averaging across
the film thickness eliminates the need for a constitutive relation providing
spatial resolution of flow profiles in this direction. In other words, the
constitutive information required to extend the classical Reynolds lubrication
equation to small lengthscales is limited to knowledge of the flowrate as a
function of the gap height, which is significantly less complex than a general
constitutive relation, and can be obtained by experiments and/or offline
molecular simulations of pressure driven flow under fully developed conditions.

Every real-world
system interacts with and is dependent on other systems, and this
interdependency affects their performance. In particular, interdependencies
among networks make them vulnerable to failure cascades, the effects of which
are often catastrophic. Failure propagation fragments network components,
disconnects them, and may cause complete systemic failure. We propose a
strategy of avoiding or at least mitigating the complete destruction of a
system of interdependent networks experiencing a failure cascade. Starting with
a fraction $1-p$ of failing nodes in one network, we reconnect with a
probability $\gamma$ every isolated component to a functional giant component
(GC), the largest connected cluster. We find that as $\gamma$ increases the
resilience of the system to cascading failure also increases. We also find that
our strategy is more effective when it is applied in a network of low average
degree. We solve the problem theoretically using percolation theory, and we
find that the solution agrees with simulation results.

performance when interconnected in deep networks. Arguably, the Tsetlin
Automaton is an even simpler and more versatile learning mechanism, capable of
solving the multi-armed bandit problem. Merely by means of a single integer as
memory, it learns the optimal action in stochastic environments through
increment and decrement operations. In this paper, we introduce the Tsetlin
Machine, which solves complex pattern recognition problems with propositional
formulas, composed by a collective of Tsetlin Automata. To eliminate the
longstanding problem of vanishing signal-to-noise ratio, the Tsetlin Machine
orchestrates the automata using a novel game. Further, both inputs, patterns,
and outputs are expressed as bits, while recognition and learning rely on bit
manipulation, simplifying computation. Our theoretical analysis establishes
that the Nash equilibria of the game align with the propositional formulas that
provide optimal pattern recognition accuracy. This translates to learning
without local optima, only global ones. In five benchmarks, the Tsetlin Machine
provides competitive accuracy compared with SVMs, Decision Trees, Random
Forests, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. We
further demonstrate how the propositional formulas facilitate interpretation.
In conclusion, we believe the combination of high accuracy, interpretability,
and computational simplicity makes the Tsetlin Machine a promising tool for a
wide range of domains.

extensively studied in existing works for computation resource scarcity.
However, most of them failed to jointly consider the two techniques together,

the group-buying mechanism, this paper proposes three-stage auction schemes by
combining cloudlet placement and resource assignment, to improve the social
welfare subject to the economic properties. We first divide all MUs into some
small groups according to the associated APs. Then the MUs in same group can
trade with cloudlets in a group-buying way through the APs. Finally, the MUs
pay for the cloudlets if they are the winners in the auction scheme. We prove
that our auction schemes can work in polynomial time. We also provide the
proofs for economic properties in theory. For the purpose of performance
comparison, we compare the proposed schemes with HAF, which is a centralized
cloudlet placement scheme without auction. Numerical results confirm the
correctness and efficiency of the proposed schemes.

the global solar magnetic field on localised chromospheric jets, the
macrospicules (MS). To find a connection between the long-term variation of
properties of MS and other solar activity proxies, including e.g. the temporal
variation of the frequency shift of solar global oscillations, sunspot area,
etc., a database overarching seven years of observations was built up. This
database contains 362 MS, based on observations at the 30.4 nm of the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). Three of the five investigated physical properties of MS show a clear
long-term temporal variation after smoothing the raw data. Wavelet analysis of
the temporal variation of maximum length, maximum area and average velocity is
carried out. The results reveal a strong pattern of periodicities at around
2-year (also referred to as Quasi-Biennial Oscillations -- QBOs). Comparison to
solar activity proxies, that also possess the properties of QBOs, provides some
interesting features: the minima and maxima of QBOs of MS properties occur at
around the same epoch as the minima and maxima of these activity proxies. For
most of the time span investigated, the oscillations are out-of-phase. This
out-of-phase behaviour was also corroborated by a cross-correlation analysis.
These results suggest that the physical processes, that generate and drive the
long-term evolution of the global solar activity proxies, may be coupled to the
short-term local physical processes driving the macrospicules, and, therefore
modulate the properties of local dynamics.

determined by means of uniaxial cyclic deformation tests under fully-reversed
deformation ($R_\varepsilon$ = -1) at 400$^\circ$C in the low cycle fatigue
regime. The model was based in the determination of the fatigue indicator
parameter (based on the local crystallographic strain energy dissipated per
cycle) by means of computational homogenization of a representative volume
element of the microstructure. The mechanical response of the single crystal
within the polycrystal was modelled through a phenomenological crystal
plasticity model which was modified to account for the effect of grain size on
the monotonic and cyclic hardening/softening mechanisms. The
microstructure-based crack initiation model parameters were calibrated from the
experimental tests of the material with fine grain size. The results of the
fatigue simulations were in good agreement with the experimental results in
terms of the cyclic stress-strain curves and of the number of cycles for
fatigue crack initiation. The model did not show any grain size effect on the
fatigue life for the largest cyclic strain ranges while the predicted fatigue
life predicted was considerably longer in the case of the microstructure with
fine grain size for the lowest strain ranges, in quantitative agreement with

results. We then show how de Rham's theory of currents, and Sullivan's theory

begins with their definition and an exploration of some of their basic

generalization of a theorem by Mal'cev. The original theorem characterizes the
local Lie groups that are part of a (global) Lie group. We give the
corresponding result for local Lie groupoids. The second result is the
generalization of a theorem by Olver which classifies local Lie groups in terms
of Lie groups. Our generalization classifies, in terms of Lie groupoids, those
local Lie groupoids that have integrable algebroids. The third and final result
demonstrates a relationship between the associativity of a local Lie groupoid,
and the integrability of its algebroid. In a certain sense, the monodromy

comparable to PbTe and Bi$_2$Te$_3$, despite its low density and simple
structure. The excellent thermoelectric performance ($zT$ $\sim$ 1.5) in

conduction band, while its anomalous thermal properties have been largely
overlooked. To explain the origin of the low lattice thermal conductivity of
Mg$_3$Sb$_2$, we have used both experimental methods and ab initio phonon
calculations to investigate trends in the elasticity, thermal expansion and
anharmonicity of $A$Mg$_2Pn_2$ Zintl compounds with $A$ = Mg, Ca, Yb, and $Pn$
= Sb and Bi. Phonon calculations within the quasi-harmonic approximation reveal
large mode Gr\""uneisen parameters in Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ compared with isostructural
compounds, in particular in transverse acoustic modes involving shearing of
adjacent anionic layers. Measurements of the elastic moduli and sound velocity
as a function of temperature using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy provide a
window into the softening of the acoustic branches at high temperature,
confirming their exceptionally high anharmonicity. We attribute the anomalous
thermal behavior of Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ to the diminutive size of Mg, which may be too
small for the octahedrally-coordinated site, leading to weak, unstable
interlayer Mg-Sb bonding. This suggests more broadly that soft shear modes

variations on the luminosity distance and on the peak luminosity of Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). For this, we consider the change of each fundamental
constant separately and discuss a dipole model for its variation. Elaborating
upon our previous work, we take into account the variation of the peak
luminosity of Type Ia supernovae resulting from the variation of each of these
fundamental constants. Furthermore, we also include the change of the energy
release during the explosion, which was not studied before in the literature.
We perform a statistical analysis to compare the predictions of the dipole
model for {\alpha} and c variation with the Union2.1 and JLA compilations of
SNe Ia. For this, we also allow the nuisance parameters of the distance
estimator $\mu_0$ and the cosmological density matter $\Omega_m$ to vary. As a
result of our analysis we obtain a first estimate of the possible spatial
variation of the speed of light c. On the other hand, we find that there is no
significant difference between the several phenomenological models studied here
and the standard cosmological model, in which fundamental constants do not vary
at all. Thus, we conclude that the actual set of data of Type Ia supernovae

\mathbb{E}[X] + 1] \geq \alpha > 0,\] for some $\alpha \geq 1/13$. This bound
was later improved to $1/8$ by He, Zhang, and Zhang. By a finer consideration
of the first four moments, we further improve the bound to approximately $.14$.
The conjectured true bound is $1/e \simeq .368$, so there is still (possibly)
quite a gap left to fill.

determination of numerous stellar labels from observed spectra, based on
fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines a number of important
methodological aspects: it exploits the information from much of the available
spectral range; it fits all labels (stellar parameters and element abundances)
simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the atmosphere structure and the
radiative transport are consistently calculated to reflect the stellar labels.
At its core The Payne has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and
prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label-space, which is flexible
and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of ab initio models (O(1000)
for 25 labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a suitable
choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a spectral flux prediction
good to $10^{-3}$ rms across a wide range of $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g (including
dwarfs and giants). We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to
the APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently improved line
lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically sensible stellar parameters
as well as 15 element abundances that appear to be more precise than the
published APOGEE DR14 values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the
first time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress towards
optimal modelling of survey spectra; and it leads to both precise and accurate
estimates of stellar labels, based on physical models and without
re-calibration. Both the codes and catalog are made publicly available online.

$p+id$ pairing on an ordinary spin-degenerate Fermi sruface realizes
second-order topological superconductivity as well. In the latter case we find
that the topological invariants describing the system can be written using
simple formulae involving only the low-energy properties of the Fermi surfaces

superconducting states can be intrinsically realized in a metallic system with

proximity effect in a heterostructure of cuprate and topological

young method which only became important in recent years because of the rapid

of statistical observational constraints. With planetary population synthesis,
the theory of planet formation and evolution can be put to the test against
these constraints. In this review of planetary population synthesis, we first
briefly list key observational constraints. Then, the work flow in the method
and its two main components are presented, namely global end-to-end models that
predict planetary system properties directly from protoplanetary disk
properties and probability distributions for these initial conditions. An
overview of various population synthesis models in the literature is given. The
sub-models for the physical processes considered in global models are
described: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, the planets' accretion of
solids and gas, orbital migration, and N-body interactions among concurrently
growing protoplanets. Next, typical population synthesis results are
illustrated in the form of new syntheses obtained with the latest generation of
the Bern model. Planetary formation tracks, the distribution of planets in the
mass-distance and radius-distance plane, the planetary mass function, and the
distributions of planetary radii, semimajor axes, and luminosities are shown,
linked to underlying physical processes, and compared with their observational
counterparts. We finish by highlighting the most important predictions made by
population synthesis models and discuss the lessons learned from these
predictions - both those later observationally confirmed and those rejected.

discoveries have thus far increased the substellar census in Taurus by $\approx
40\%$ and added three more L-type members ($\approx 5-10$ M$_{\rm Jup}$). Most
notably, our discoveries reveal an older ($>$10 Myr) low-mass population in

at the centers of dark matter haloes using the EAGLE suite of hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations. We find that at redshifts $z{\le}2$ the accretion
rate onto the galaxy increases with halo mass in the halo mass range
$10^{10}-10^{11.7}M_{\odot}$, flattens between the halo masses
$10^{11.7}-10^{12.7}M_{\odot}$, and increases again for higher-mass haloes.
However, the galaxy gas accretion does not flatten at intermediate halo masses
when AGN feedback is switched off. To better understand these trends, we
develop a physically motivated semi-analytic model of galaxy gas accretion. We
show that the flattening is produced by the rate of gas cooling from the hot
halo. The ratio of the cooling radius and the virial radius does not decrease
continuously with increasing halo mass as generally thought. While it decreases
up to ${\sim}10^{13}M_{\odot}$ haloes, it increases for higher halo masses,
causing an upturn in the galaxy gas accretion rate. This may indicate that in
high-mass haloes AGN feedback is not sufficiently efficient. When there is no
AGN feedback, the density of the hot halo is higher, the ratio of the cooling
and virial radii does not decrease as much and the cooling rate is higher.
Changes in the efficiency of stellar feedback can also increase or decrease the
accretion rates onto galaxies. The trends can plausibly be explained by the
re-accretion of gas ejected by progenitor galaxies and by the suppression of
black hole growth, and hence AGN feedback, by stellar feedback.

time distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties.
We use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial
conditions and physical processes. In particular we consider different
common-envelope evolution models and different NS natal kick distributions. We
provide detailed predictions arising from each of the models considered. We
find that the majority of NS-WD mergers are born in systems in which
mass-transfer played an important role, and the WD formed before the NS. For
the majority of the mergers the WDs have a carbon-oxygen composition (60-80%)
and most of the rest are with oxygen-neon WDs. The rates of NS-WD mergers are
in the range of 3-15% of the type Ia supernovae (SNe) rate. Their delay time
distribution is very similar to that of type Ia SNe, but slightly biased
towards earlier times. They typically explode in young 0.1-1Gyr environments,
but have a tail distribution extending to long, Gyrs-timescales. Models
including significant kicks give rise to relatively wide offset distribution
extending to hundreds of kpcs. The demographic and physical properties of NS-WD
mergers suggest they are likely to be peculiar type Ic-like SNe, mostly
exploding in late type galaxies. Their overall properties could be related to a
class of rapidly evolving SNe recently observed, while they are less likely to
be related to the class of Ca-rich SNe.

can exist only when the ratios of the electron recombination rate to the
photoionization rate and the electron impact ionization rate to the
recombination rate lie in certain ranges. These ratios are computed for several
ionization states of nitrogen. Photoionization fronts are found to exist for
laser driven models with moderate nitrogen densities ($\sim$10$^{21}$

lower nitrogen densities are preferred ($<$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$). We conclude

constraints. Of the ~10,000-40,000 BHs that accumulate in the central parsec
over the age of the Galaxy, we predict that ~60 - 200 currently exist as
BH-XRBs formed from tidal capture, consistent with the population seen by
Hailey et al. A somewhat lower number of tidal capture NS-XRBs is also
predicted. We also use our observationally calibrated models for the NSC to

rotating black string can be obtained from a static one by means of an
`illegitimate coordinate transformation', a local boost in the compact
direction. On the basis of the gauge/gravity duality, these black strings are
dual to rotating thermal states of a strongly interacting conformal field
theory (CFT) that lives on a cylinder. In this work, we obtain the complete
quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the gravitational perturbations of rotating
black strings. Analytic solutions for the dispersion relations are found in the
hydrodynamic limit, characterized by fluctuations with wavenumber and frequency
much smaller than the Hawking temperature of the string (or the temperature in
the CFT dual description). We obtain these dispersion relations both by
studying the gravitational perturbations of rotating black strings and by
investigating the hydrodynamic fluctuations of a moving fluid living on the
boundary of the AdS spacetime. Relativistic effects like the Doppler shift of
the frequencies, wavelength contraction, and dilation of the thermalization
time are shown explicitly in such a regime. We also investigate the behavior of
a sound wave propagating in a viscous fluid for several values of the rotation
parameter. The numerical solutions for the fundamental QNMs show a crossover (a
transition) from a hydrodynamic-like behavior to a linear relativistic scaling
for large wavenumbers. Additionally, we find a new family of QNMs which are
purely damped in the zero wavenumber limit and that does not follow as a
continuation of QNMs of the static black string, but that appears to be closely

the nature of this phenomena is not yet understood. In this paper, we explore
the truncations in two nearby (D ~15 Mpc) Milky Way-like galaxies: NGC 4565 and
NGC 5907. We cover a wide wavelength range from the NUV and optical, to 3.6
{\mu}m. We find that the radius of the truncation (26+/-0.5 kpc) is independent
of wavelength. Surprisingly, we identify (at all wavelengths) the truncation at
altitudes as high as 3 kpc above the mid-plane, which implies that the thin
disc in those outer regions has a width of at least this value. We find the
characteristic U-shape radial colour profile associated with a star formation
threshold at the location of the truncation. Further supporting such an origin,
the stellar mass density at the position of the truncation is ~1-2 M_sun pc^-2,
in good agreement with the critical gas density for transforming gas into
stars. Beyond the truncation, the stellar mass in the mid-plane of the disc
drops to just 0.1-0.2% of the total stellar mass of the galaxies. The detection
of the truncation at high altitude in combination with the U shape of the
radial colour profile allows us to establish, for the first time, an upper
limit to the present-day growth rate of galactic discs. We find that, if the
discs of the galaxies are growing inside-out, their growth rate is less than
0.6-0.9 kpc Gyr^-1.

Fermi points, motivated by topological phase transitions between Dirac and Weyl
semi-metals. A Dirac point in Dirac semi-metals may be split into two Weyl
points by breaking a lattice symmetry or time reversal symmetry, and the
Lifshitz transition is commonly used to describe the phase transitions. Here,
we show that the Lifshitz description is fundamentally incorrect in QPTs with
splitting nodal Fermi points. We argue that correlations between fermions,
order parameter, and the long range Coulomb interaction { must} be incorporated
from the beginning. One of the most striking correlation effects we find is
{\it infinite anisotropy} of physical quantities, which cannot appear in a
Lifshitz transition. By using the standard renormalization group (RG) method,
two types of infinitely anisotropic quantum criticalities are found in three
spatial dimensions varying with the number of the Dirac points ($N_f$). For
$N_f = 1$, the ratio of the fermion velocity to the velocity of order parameter
excitations becomes universal ($\sqrt{2}-1$) along the Dirac point splitting
direction . For $N_f >1$, we find that fermions are parametrically faster than
order parameter excitations in all directions. Our RG analysis is fully
controlled by the fact that order parameter and fermion fluctuations are at the
upper critical dimension, and thus our stable fixed points demonstrate the
presence of weakly coupled quantum criticalities with infinite anisotropy.

cosmological purposes due to limited localisation will accumulate with the
advent of new facilities and continued efforts by, e.g., the SUPERB
collaboration, which may require afterglows or multi-wavelength counterparts
for sub-arcsecond localisation. It is important to exploit these sources to
their maximum scientific potential. We perform analysis of FRB dispersion
measures (DMs), considering different theoretical FRB progenitors with view to
place more rigorous constraints on FRB redshifts, in particular for large
statistical samples, via their DMs. We review FRB DM components, and build
redshift-scalable probability distributions corresponding to different
progenitor scenarios. We combine these components into a framework for
obtaining FRB DM probabilities given their redshifts. Taking into account
different possibilities for the evolution of progenitors across cosmic time we
invert this model, thus deriving redshift constraints. Effects of varying FRB
progenitor models are illustrated. While, as expected, host galaxy DM
contributions become decreasingly important with increasing redshift, for
AGN-like progenitor scenarios they could remain significant out to redshift 3.
Constraints are placed on redshifts of catalogued FRBs with various models and
increasingly realistic models may be employed as general understanding of FRBs
improves. For localised FRBs, we highlight future prospects for disentangling
host and intergalactic medium DM components using their respective redshift
scaling. We identify a use for large samples of unlocalised FRBs resulting from
upcoming flux-limited surveys, such as with CHIME, in mapping out the Milky Way

decision making (ADM) is used in crime forecasting. In America forecasting
tools are widely used by judiciary systems for making decisions about risk
offenders based on criminal justice for risk offenders. By making use of such
tools, the judiciary relies on ADM in order to make error free judgement on
offenders. For this purpose, one of the quality measures for machine learning
techniques which is widly used, the $AUC$ (area under curve), is compared to
and contrasted for results with the $PPV_k$ (positive predictive value).
Keeping in view the criticality of judgement along with a high dependency on
tools offering ADM, it is necessary to evaluate risk tools that aid in decision
making based on algorithms. In this methodology, such an evaluation is
conducted by implementing a common machine learning approach called binary
classifier, as it determines the binary outcome of the underlying juristic
question. This thesis showed that the $PPV_k$ (positive predictive value)
technique models the decision of judges much better than the $AUC$. Therefore,
this research has investigated whether there exists a classifier for which the
$PPV_k$ deviates from $AUC$ by a large proportion. It could be shown that the
deviation can rise up to 0.75. In order to test this deviation on an already in
used Classifier, data from the fourth generation risk assement tool COMPAS was
used. The result were were quite alarming as the two measures derivate from
each other by 0.48. In this study, the risk assessment evaluation of the
forecasting tools was successfully conducted, carefully reviewed and examined.
Additionally, it is also discussed whether such systems used for the purpose of
making decisions should be socially accepted or not.

emission lines. Their ratios are consistent with photoionization in normal H II
regions, by modest numbers of OB stars; they must be obscured along our line of
sight. The location raises the question of whether this star-forming episode
was enhanced or triggered by an outflow from the central parts of Centaurus A.
Optical emission-line ratios and line widths limit the role of shocks on the
gas, so any interaction with an outflow, either from the radio source or star
formation in the gas-rich disk, can at most have compressed the gas weakly. We
speculate that the presence of similar star-forming regions on both sides of
the galaxy, contrasted with the difference in the character of the
emission-line clouds, reflects the presence of a collimated radio jet to the
northeast and perhaps anisotropic escape of ionizing radiation from the AGN.
Star formation on the southwestern side of Cen A could be enhanced by a broad
outflow, distinct from the radio jet and lobes. (abridged)

image registration; however, the metrics are currently constructed from aligned
image pairs in the training data. In this paper, we propose a strategy for
learning such metrics from roughly aligned training data. Symmetrizing the data
corrects bias in the metric that results from misalignment in the data (at the
expense of increased variance), while random perturbations to the data, i.e.
dithering, ensures that the metric has a single mode, and is amenable to
registration by optimization. Evaluation is performed on the task of
registration on separate unseen test image pairs. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of learning a useful deep metric from substantially misaligned
training data, in some cases the results are significantly better than from
Mutual Information. Data augmentation via dithering is, therefore, an effective
strategy for discharging the need for well-aligned training data; this brings
deep metric registration from the realm of supervised to semi-supervised
machine learning.

possible to define and to analyze anisotropy in elastic media from first
principles in thin films. Therefore, the constitutive relation between strain

A new equation for the stress of the film-substrate system is proposed based on
Newton's laws and energy conservation. As an application, it use the technique
and data developed by Faurie et al (2005) in fiber-textured gold film deposited
onto Kapton substrate by combining synchrotron X-Ray diffraction in situ

transversely isotropic, therefore, is firstly required a texture analysis with
the purpose of determining the possible Euler angles ($\phi$) and ($\psi$) for
each crystallographic direction that can be used in the model equations. With
the data, it is possible to make graphics, $\varepsilon$ (strain) X F, for

fluid hydrocarbon mixture containing methane and n-dodecane is studied. The AA
considered is a surface-active compound with a complex hydrophilic head that
contains both amide and tertiary ammonium cation groups and hydrophobic tails.
At sufficiently high AA density, the interplay between the surfactant layer and
the liquid hydrocarbon excludes methane from the interfacial region. In this
scenario, we combine metadynamics and umbrella sampling frameworks to study
accurately the free-energy landscape and the equilibrium rates associated with
the transport of one methane molecule across the AA film. We observe that local
configurational changes of the liquid hydrocarbon packed within the AA film are
associated with high free-energy barriers for methane transport. The time
scales estimated for the transport of methane across the AA film can be, in
some cases, comparable to those reported in the literature for the growth of
the hydrates, suggesting that one possible mechanism by which AAs delay the
formation of hydrate plugs could be providing a barrier to methane transport.
Considering the interplay between structural design and collective properties
of AAs might be of relevance to improve their performance in flow assurance.

With
further computation, methods exist to reason about richer models with inputs,
nonlinear differential equations, and hybrid dynamics. As such, the scalability
of affine systems verification is a prerequisite to scalable analysis for more
complex systems. In this paper, we improve the scalability of affine systems
verification, in terms of the number of dimensions (variables) in the system.
  The reachable states of affine systems can be written in terms of the matrix
exponential, and safety checking can be performed at specific time steps with
linear programming. Unfortunately, for large systems with many state variables,
this direct approach requires an intractable amount of memory while using an
intractable amount of computation time. We overcome these challenges by
combining several methods that leverage common problem structure. Memory is
reduced by exploiting initial states that are not full-dimensional and safety
properties (outputs) over a few linear projections of the state variables.
Computation time is saved by using numerical simulations to compute only
projections of the matrix exponential relevant for the verification problem.
Since large systems often have sparse dynamics, we use Krylov-subspace
simulation approaches based on the Arnoldi or Lanczos iterations. Our method
produces accurate counter-examples when properties are violated and, in the
extreme case with sufficient problem structure, can analyze a system with one
billion real-valued state variables.

$\mathcal{N}$, with positive and negative values indicating repulsion and
attraction of magnons, respectively. In thin magnetic films with easy-plane
magnetic anisotropy, magnon attraction is typically achieved for an in-plane
magnetization. At sufficient stimulus, e.g. via application of spin transfer
torque, the attraction can give rise to self-localized magnetic solitons, such
as spin wave bullets, which shrink as their amplitude increases. In contrast,
for an oblique magnetization above a certain critical angle, the repulsion of
magnons only allows for propagating modes, which expand when pumped more
strongly. Here we demonstrate, both analytically and using micromagnetic
simulations, that such a dichotomic description is inadequate for magnonic edge
modes, which naturally appear in confined magnetic systems. In particular, we
demonstrate that the confinement potential of such modes is nonlinear in nature

strength. Dislocations experience a drag due to their interaction with the

dependence of this effect has eluded a good theoretical understanding. In a
previous paper, dislocation drag from phonon wind as a function of velocity was
computed from first principles in the isotropic limit, in part for simplicity,
but also arguing that macroscopically, a polycrystalline metal looks isotropic.
However, since the single crystal grains are typically a few microns up to a
millimeter in size, dislocations travel in single crystals and cross
boundaries, but never actually see an isotropic material. In this work we
therefore highlight the effect of crystal anisotropy on dislocation drag by
accounting for the crystal and slip plane geometries. In particular, we keep
the phonon spectrum isotropic for simplicity, but dislocations are modeled
according to the crystal symmetry (bcc, fcc, hcp, etc.). We then compare to the
earlier purely isotropic results, as well as to experimental data and MD

in our PTAS is a construction of a nearly light subset $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner

a necessary and sufficient condition given by \emph{sparse spanner oracles}:
light subset spanners exist if and only if sparse spanner oracles exist. This
relationship allows us to obtain two new results: _ An $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner
with lightness $O(\epsilon^{-d+2})$ for any doubling metric of constant
dimension $d$. This improves the earlier lightness bound $\epsilon^{-O(d)}$
obtained by Borradaile, Le and Wulff-Nilsen. _ An $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with
sublinear lightness for any metric of constant correlation dimension.

of ridge functions $f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^m g_i(a_i\cdot x)$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$,
representing a general form of a shallow feed-forward neural network, from a
small number of query samples. Higher order differentiation, as used in our
constructive approximations, of sums of ridge functions or of their

second order differentiation and tensors of order two (i.e., matrices) suffice
as we prove in this paper. We use two sampling schemes to perform approximate
differentiation - active sampling, where the sampling points are universal,
actively, and randomly designed, and passive sampling, where sampling points
were preselected at random from a distribution with known density. Based on
multiple gathered approximated first and second order differentials, our
general approximation strategy is developed as a sequence of algorithms to
perform individual sub-tasks. We first perform an active subspace search by
approximating the span of the weight vectors $a_1,\dots,a_m$. Then we use a
straightforward substitution, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem
from $d$ to $m$. The core of the construction is then the stable and efficient
approximation of weights expressed in terms of rank-$1$ matrices $a_i \otimes
a_i$, realized by formulating their individual identification as a suitable
nonlinear program. We prove the successful identification by this program of
weight vectors being close to orthonormal and we also show how we can
costructively reduce to this case by a whitening procedure, without loss of any

(RBF) interpolation for numerically simulating transport on a sphere. The
methods are mesh-free and are formulated entirely in Cartesian coordinates,
thus avoiding any irregular clustering of nodes at artificial boundaries on the
sphere and naturally bypassing any apparent artificial singularities associated
with surface-based coordinate systems. For problems involving tracer transport
in a given velocity field, the semi-Lagrangian framework allows these new
methods to avoid the use of any stabilization terms (such as hyperviscosity)

rotation and deformational flow are used to compare and contrast the methods in
terms of their accuracy, efficiency, conservation properties, and

scenes. The task is to fuse multiple images obtained by exposure bracketing to
create an image which comprises a high level of details. Typically, such images
are not possible to obtain directly from a camera due to hardware limitations,
e.g., a limited dynamic range of the sensor. A major problem of such tasks is
that the images may not be spatially aligned due to scene motion or camera
motion. It is known that the required alignment by image registration problems
is ill-posed. In this case, the images to be aligned vary in their intensity
range, which makes the problem even more difficult.
  To address the mentioned problems, we propose an end-to-end
\emph{Convolutional Neural Network} (CNN) based approach to learn to estimate
exposure fusion from $2$ and $3$ Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images depicting
different scene contents. To the best of our knowledge, no efficient and robust
CNN-based end-to-end approach can be found in the literature for this kind of
problem. The idea is to create a dataset with perfectly aligned LDR images to
obtain ground-truth exposure fusion images. At the same time, we obtain
additional LDR images with some motion, having the same exposure fusion
ground-truth as the perfectly aligned LDR images. This way, we can train an
end-to-end CNN having misaligned LDR input images, but with a proper ground
truth exposure fusion image. We propose a specific CNN-architecture to solve
this problem. In various experiments, we show that the proposed approach yields
excellent results.

then at least one box has no more than $n / m$ items. It is utilized to solve
many data management problems, especially for thresholded similarity searches.
Despite many pigeonhole principle-based solutions proposed in the last few
decades, the condition stated by the principle is weak. It only constrains the
number of items in a single box. By organizing the boxes in a ring, we propose
a new principle, called the pigeonring principle, which constrains the number
of items in multiple boxes and yields stronger conditions. To utilize the new
principle, we focus on problems defined in the form of identifying data objects
whose similarities or distances to the query is constrained by a threshold.
Many solutions to these problems utilize the pigeonhole principle to find
candidates that satisfy a filtering condition. By the new principle, stronger
filtering conditions can be established. We show that the pigeonhole principle
is a special case of the new principle. This suggests that all the pigeonhole
principle-based solutions are possible to be accelerated by the new principle.
A universal filtering framework is introduced to encompass the solutions to
these problems based on the new principle. Besides, we discuss how to quickly
find candidates specified by the new principle. The implementation requires
only minor modifications on top of existing pigeonhole principle-based
algorithms. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the applicability
of the new principle as well as the superior performance of the algorithms
based on the new principle.

Since they can easily adapt to dynamic environments, soft robotic systems have
the potential of changing the status-quo of bulky robotics. A crucial component
of soft robotics is a soft actuator that is activated by external stimuli to
generate desired motions. Unfortunately, there is a lack of powerful soft
actuators that operate through lightweight power sources. To that end, we
recently designed a highly scalable, flexible, biocompatible Electromagnetic
Soft Actuator (ESA). With ESAs, artificial muscles can be designed by
integrating a network of ESAs. The main research gap addressed in this work is
in the absence of system-theoretic understanding of the impact of the realtime
control and actuator selection algorithms on the performance of networked
soft-body actuators and ESAs. The objective of this paper is to establish a
framework that guides the analysis and robust control of networked ESAs. A
novel ESA is described, and a configuration of soft actuator matrix to resemble
artificial muscle fiber is presented. A mathematical model which depicts the
physical network is derived, considering the disturbances due to external
forces and linearization errors as an integral part of this model. Then, a
robust control and minimal actuator selection problem with logistic constraints

are proposed with numerical case studies.

persistent homology, and, more specifically, the persistence diagram.
Persistence diagrams have also become objects of interest in topological data
analysis. However, persistence diagrams do not naturally lend themselves to
statistical goals, such as inferring certain population characteristics,
because their complicated structure makes common algebraic operations--such as
addition, division, and multiplication-- challenging (e.g., the mean might not
be unique). To bypass these issues, several functional summaries of persistence
diagrams have been proposed in the literature (e.g. landscape and silhouette
functions). The problem of analyzing a set of persistence diagrams then becomes
the problem of analyzing a set of functions, which is a topic that has been
studied for decades in statistics. First, we review the various functional
summaries in the literature and propose a unified framework for the functional
summaries. Then, we generalize the definition of persistence landscape
functions, establish several theoretical properties of the persistence
functional summaries, and demonstrate and discuss their performance in the

learning algorithm can be decomposed into training error and generalization
error. While the former is controlled by its convergence analysis, the latter
can be tightly handled by algorithmic stability. The machine learning community
has a rich history investigating convergence and stability separately. However,
the question about the trade-off between these two quantities remains open. In
this paper, we show that for any iterative algorithm at any iteration, the
overall performance is lower bounded by the minimax statistical error over an
appropriately chosen loss function class. This implies an important trade-off
between convergence and stability of the algorithm -- a faster converging
algorithm has to be less stable, and vice versa. As a direct consequence of
this fundamental tradeoff, new convergence lower bounds can be derived for
classes of algorithms constrained with different stability bounds. In
particular, when the loss function is convex (or strongly convex) and smooth,
we discuss the stability upper bounds of gradient descent (GD) and stochastic
gradient descent and their variants with decreasing step sizes. For Nesterov's
accelerated gradient descent (NAG) and heavy ball method (HB), we provide
stability upper bounds for the quadratic loss function. Applying existing
stability upper bounds for the gradient methods in our trade-off framework, we
obtain lower bounds matching the well-established convergence upper bounds up
to constants for these algorithms and conjecture similar lower bounds for NAG
and HB. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the tightness of our stability
bounds in terms of exponents in the rate and also illustrate via a simulated
logistic regression problem that our stability bounds reflect the
generalization errors better than the simple uniform convergence bounds for GD

abilities based on the computing and data storage capabilities of cloud virtual
machines, which makes protecting virtual machine filesystem very important for
the whole system security. Agentless periodic filesystem monitors are optimal
solutions to protect cloud virtual machines because of the secure and
low-overhead features. However, most of the periodic monitors usually scan all
of the virtual machine filesystem or protected files in every scanning poll, so
lots of secure files are scanned again and again even though they are not
corrupted. In this paper, we propose a novel agentless periodic filesystem
monitor framework for virtual machines with different image formats to improve
the performance of agentless periodic monitors. Our core idea is to minimize
the scope of the scanning files in both file integrity checking and virus
detection. In our monitor, if a file is considered secure, it will not be
scanned when it has not been modified. Since our monitor only scans the newly
created and modified files, it can check fewer files than other filesystem
monitors. To that end, we propose two monitor methods for different types of
virtual machine disks to reduce the number of scanning files. For virtual
machine with single disk image, we hook the backend driver to capture the disk
modification information. For virtual machine with multiple copy-onwrite
images, we leverage the copy-on-write feature of QCOW2 images to achieve the
disk modification analysis. In addition, our system can restore and remove the
corrupted files. The experimental results show that our system is effective for
both Windows and Linux virtual machines with different image formats and can
reduce the number of scanning files and scanning time.

sensitivity they will inevitably encounter an irreducible background arising
from coherent neutrino scattering. This so-called ""neutrino floor"" may
significantly reduce the sensitivity of an experiment to DM-nuclei
interactions, particularly if the recoil spectrum of the neutrino background is
approximately degenerate with the DM signal. This occurs for the conventionally
considered spin-independent (SI) or spin-dependent (SD) interactions. In such
case, an increase in the experiment's exposure by multiple orders of magnitude
may not yield any significant increase in sensitivity. The typically considered
SI and SD interactions, however, do not adequately reflect the whole landscape
of the well-motivated DM models, which includes other interactions. Since
particle DM has not been detected yet in laboratories, it is essential to
understand and maximize the detection capabilities for a broad variety of
possible models and signatures. In this work we explore the impact of the
background arising from various neutrino sources on the discovery potential of
a DM signal for a large class of viable DM-nucleus interactions and several
potential futuristic experimental settings, with different target elements. For
some momentum suppressed cross sections, large DM particle masses and heavier
targets, we find that there is no suppression of the discovery limits due to

mathematics as only a calculational tool, isolating it from their rich
knowledge of the physical world. We are interested in cases where students
break that pattern by reading, manipulating, and building equations
meaningfully rather than purely formally. To find examples of this and explore
the diversity of ways students combine formal and intuitive resources, we
conducted problem-solving interviews with students in an introductory physics
for life sciences class. During the interviews, we scaffolded student use of
strategies which call for both formal and intuitive reasoning, such as ""examine
the extreme cases"". We use the analytic framework of epistemic games to model
how students used the strategies and how they accessed problem-solving
resources, and we present evidence that novice students using these strategies
accessed more expert-like conceptual systems than those typically described in
problem-solving literature. They blended physical intuition with mathematical
symbolic templates, reconceptualized the nature of equations, and distinguished
similar functional forms. Once introduced to a strategy, students applied it to
new scenarios and found new types of uses for it, acknowledging it as a useful,
general purpose problem-solving technique. Our data suggests that these
strategies can potentially help novice students learn to develop and apply
their physical intuition more effectively.

employed to explore the underlying structures of the relation graph, and obtain
the communities of malapps. We evaluate our community detection method with
3996 malapp samples. Extensive experimental results show that our method
outperforms the traditional clustering methods and achieves the best
performance with rand statistic of 94.93% and accuracy of 79.53%.

this problem with constant probability of success, using
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}+\log n)$ bits of space, was given by Kane,
Nelson and Woodruff in 2010.
  The standard approach used in order to achieve low failure probability
$\delta$ is to take the median of $\log \delta^{-1}$ parallel repetitions of
the original algorithm. We show that such a multiplicative space blow-up is
unnecessary: we provide an optimal algorithm using $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log

bounds for this problem. That is, the $\log\delta^{-1}$ factor does not
multiply the $\log n$ term. This settles completely the space complexity of the

the Maxwell's equations and continuity equation. In particular, non-uniformity

exceeding characteristic dimensions of the pulses makes it possible to consider

However, CIRF cannot be applied to large-scale biometric identification, since

Furthermore, existing biometric indexing schemes cannot be used in conjunction

of the unattainability of zero temperature from the second law was proven more
than 80 years ago, yet this assertion was repeated in the literature. This
assertion naturally leads to a doubt that the unattainability of zero
temperature is not equivalent to the Nernst heat theorem. The apparent
contradiction between the Nernst heat theorem and residual entropy further
complicates the problems of the third law. Totally, the validity of the third
law seems to lose, giving an impression of somewhat ambiguous hypothesis to it.
The author has recently settled the apparent contradiction between residual
entropy and the Nernst heat theorem by refining the statement of the third law.
Based on this refinement, two controversial problems, the independence of the
unattainability of zero temperature from the second law and the equivalence of
the unattainability with the Nernst heat theorem, have been solved.

the systemic velocity of $\VLSR$ $=$ $-$11.5 {\kms}, that coincides with the
H${_2}$O masers seen in earlier radio observations two arcseconds southwest of

speeds well over the dissociation velocity ($>$ 40 {\kms}), the emission must
originate from the jet itself rather than H${_2}$ gas in the ambient medium.

from knot C in HH 167 come from two different phenomena, shocks and

confidence region for $\beta$ under restrictions on the error distribution. In
particular, we handle the following cases: (a) the measurement error is
bounded, (b) it is a normally distributed random vector, and (c) it has
independent components which are shifted Poisson random variables.

bootstrapping the classifier. The process of training, classifying, enhancing

challenging task in low-level computer vision community. The difficulty is
particularly pronounced for the limited information, for which the
corresponding reference for comparison is typically absent. Although various
feature extraction mechanisms have been leveraged from natural scene statistics
to deep neural networks in previous methods, the performance bottleneck still
exists. In this work, we propose a hallucination-guided quality regression
network to address the issue. We firstly generate a hallucinated reference
constrained on the distorted image, to compensate the absence of the true
reference. Then, we pair the information of hallucinated reference with the
distorted image, and forward them to the regressor to learn the perceptual
discrepancy with the guidance of an implicit ranking relationship within the
generator, and therefore produce the precise quality prediction. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, comprehensive experiments are evaluated on
four popular image quality assessment benchmarks. Our method significantly
outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The

activities for these manufacturing processes are difficult. Thus, the managers
need more proactive approaches to deal with this variability. In this study, a
proactive quality monitoring and control approach based on classifiers to
predict defect occurrences and provide optimal values for factors critical to
the quality processes is proposed. In a previous work (Noyel et al. 2013), the
classification approach had been used in order to improve the quality of a
lacquering process at a company plant; the results obtained are promising, but
the accuracy of the classification model used needs to be improved. One way to
achieve this is to construct a committee of classifiers (referred to as an
ensemble) to obtain a better predictive model than its constituent models.
However, the selection of the best classification methods and the construction
of the final ensemble still poses a challenging issue. In this study, we focus
and analyze the impact of the choice of classifier types on the accuracy of the
classifier ensemble; in addition, we explore the effects of the selection
criterion and fusion process on the ensemble accuracy as well. Several fusion
scenarios were tested and compared based on a real-world case. Our results show
that using an ensemble classification leads to an increase in the accuracy of
the classifier models. Consequently, the monitoring and control of the

because of its capability for material differentiation. However, material
decomposition suffers from magnified noise from two CT images of independent
scans, leading to severe degradation of image quality. Existing algorithms
achieve suboptimal decomposition performance since they fail to accurately
depict the mapping relationship between DECT and the basis material images.
Inspired by the impressive potential of CNN, we developed a new Butterfly
network to perform the image domain dual material decomposition due to its
strong approximation ability to the mapping functions in DECT. The Butterfly
network is derived from the image domain DECT decomposition model by exploring
the geometric relationship between mapping functions of data model and network
components. The network is designed as the double-entry double-out crossover
architecture based on the decomposition formulation. It enters a pair of
dual-energy images as inputs and defines the ground true decomposed images as
each label. The crossover architecture, which plays an important role in
material decomposition, is designed to implement the information exchange
between the two material generation pathways in the network. Network components
exhibit different sensitivity to basis materials in the visualization. By
analyzing their sensitivity to different basis materials, we determined the
roles of network components in material decomposition. This visualization
evaluation reveals what the network can learn and verifies the rationality of
network design. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations in material
decomposition of patient data indicate that the proposed network outperforms
its counterpart.

spatial resolution ($\sim$ 1.0 $\mu$m) in both lateral and axial directions,
using a simple and robust experimental arrangement. Line-field OCT (LF-OCT) is
a recent evolution of FF-OCT with line illumination and line detection using a
broadband spatially coherent light source and a line-scan camera in an

penetration depth due to the confocal gate achieved by line illumination and

en face images, which usually prevents in vivo applications. B-scan imaging
using LF-OCT can be considerably faster due to the possibility of using a
spatially coherent light source with much higher brightness along with a
high-speed line camera. Applied in the field of dermatology, the LF-OCT images
reveal a comprehensive morphological mapping of skin tissues in vivo at a

The subband which connects to the two zeroth LLs is spin-polarized and chiral.
In particular, when the electron transports along the side surface, the
electron spin direction can be manipulated arbitrarily by gate voltage. And no
reflection occurs even if the electron spin direction is changed. This provides
a fascinating avenue to control the electron spin easily and coherently. In
addition, regarding the subbands with high LL index, there exist spin-momentum
locking helical states and the quantum spin Hall effect can appear.

generating synthetic genes coding for antimicrobial peptides, and 2) optimizing
synthetic genes for the secondary structure of their resulting peptides. A

formed. In many instances, these structures need to exhibit a high degree of
order to be functional, although many of their constituents are intrinsically
stochastic. Hence, it has been suggested that biological robustness ultimately
must rely on complex gene regulatory networks and clean-up mechanisms. Here we
explore developmental processes that have evolved inherent robustness against
stochasticity. In the context of the Drosophila eye disc, multiple optical
units, ommatidia, develop into crystal-like patterns. During the larva-to-pupa
stage of metamorphosis, the centers of the ommatidia are specified initially
through the diffusion of morphogens, followed by the specification of R8 cells.
Establishing the R8 cell is crucial in setting up the geometric, and
functional, relationships of cells within an ommatidium and among neighboring
ommatidia. Here we study a mathematical model of these spatio-temporal
processes in the presence of stochasticity, defining and applying measures that
quantify order within the resulting spatial patterns. We observe a universal
sigmoidal response to increasing transcriptional noise. Ordered patterns
persist up to a threshold noise level in the model parameters. As the noise is
further increased past a threshold point of no return, these ordered patterns
rapidly become disordered. Such robustness in development allows for the
accumulation of genetic variation without any observable changes in phenotype.
We argue that the observed sigmoidal dependence introduces robustness allowing
for sizable amounts of genetic variation and transcriptional noise to be
tolerated in natural populations without resulting in phenotype variation.

kinematic association with M51, and the high NII/H$\alpha$, SII/H$\alpha$, and
OI/H$\alpha$ line ratios we measure imply a hard ionization source such as AGN
photoionization or shock heating rather than photoionization due to young
stars. Given the strong NII emission, we infer roughly solar metallicity for
the cloud, ruling out an origin due to infall of primordial gas. Instead we
favor models where the gas has been expelled from the inner regions of the M51
system due to tidal stripping or starburst/AGN winds and has been subsequently
ionized either by shocks or a fading AGN. This latter scenario raises the
intriguing possibility that M51 may be the nearest example of an AGN fossil

solution in a string-inspired model involving global spontaneous breaking of a

antisymmetric tensor field in the massless string multiplet. These axions carry
a charge, which, in our model, also plays the r\^ole of the magnetic charge.
The resulting geometry is close to that of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om (RN) black
hole with charge proportional to the KR-axion charge. We proposed the existence
of a thin shell structure inside a (large) core radius as the dominant mass
contribution to the energy functional. The resulting energy was finite, and
proportional to the KR-axion charge; however, the size of the shell was not
determined and left as a phenomenological parameter. In the current article, we
can calculate the mass-shell size, on proposing a regularisation of the black
hole singularity via a matching procedure between the RN metric in the outer
region and, in the inner region, a de Sitter space with a (positive)
cosmological constant proportional to the scale of the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of $SO(3)$ . The matching, which involves the Israel junction
conditions for the metric and its first derivatives at the inner surface of the
shell, determines the inner mass-shell radius. The axion charge plays an
important r\^ole in guaranteeing positivity of the ""mass coefficient"" of the
gravitational potential term appearing in the metric component; so the KR
electromagnetic monopole shows normal attractive gravitational effects. This is
to be contrasted with the global monopole case (in the absence of KR axions)
where such a matching is known to yield a negative ""mass coefficient"" (and,
hence, repulsive gravitational effects). The total energy of the monopole
within the shell is calculated.

Hove singularity. It is shown that this system can be consistently described by
an effective field theory whose Fermi surface is subdivided into regions as
defined by a factorization scale, and that the theory is renormalizable in the
sense that all of the counterterms are well defined in the IR limit. The theory
has the unusual feature that the renormalization group equation for the
coupling has an explicit dependence on the renormalization scale, much as in
theories of Wilson lines. In contrast to the case of a round Fermi surface,
there are multiple marginal interactions with nontrivial RG flow. The Cooper
instability remains strongest in the BCS channel. We also show that the
marginal Fermi liquid scenario for the quasiparticle width is a robust
consequence of the van Hove singularity. Our results are universal in the sense
that they do not depend on the detailed properties of the Fermi surface away

analysis and verification method in agile development. Objective: In this
paper, we investigate the use of Behavior Driven De- velopment (BDD) instead of
standard User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for safety verification with
System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) for safety analysis in agile
development. Method: We evaluate the effect of this combination in a controlled
experiment with 44 students in terms of productivity, test thoroughness, fault
detection effectiveness and com- munication effectiveness. Results: The results
show that BDD is more effective for safety verification regarding the impact on
communication effectiveness than standard UAT, whereas productivity, test
thorough- ness and fault detection effectiveness show no statistically
significant difference in our controlled experiment. Conclusion: The
combination of BDD and STPA seems promising with an enhancement on communica-
tion, but its impact needs more research.

the coupled-cluster method we go beyond singles and doubles excitations and
include leading-order three-particle-three-hole (3p-3h) excitations for the
ground state, excited states, and the similarity transformed operator. We study
electromagnetic sum rules, such as the bremsstrahlung sum rule m_0 and the
polarizability sum rule alpha_D using interactions from chiral effective field
theory. To gauge the quality of our coupled-cluster approximations we perform
several benchmarks with the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics
approach in 4He and with self consistent Green's function in 16O. We compute
the dipole polarizability of 48Ca employing the chiral interaction N2LOsat
[Ekstroem et al., Phys. Rev. C 91, 051301 (2015)] and the 1.8/2.0 (EM) [Hebeler

excitations in the ground state is small for 1.8/2.0 (EM) but non-negligible
for N2LOsat. The addition of these new correlations allows us to improve the
precision of our 48Ca calculations and reconcile the recently reported
discrepancy between coupled-cluster results based on these interactions and the
experimentally determined alpha_D from proton inelastic scattering in 48Ca

generic geometric orbifolds in the sense of Campana, with only one component

marker-free method to determine the refractive index of single, spherical cells
in suspension. The refractive index is a conclusive measure in a biological
context. Cell conditions, such as differentiation or infection, are known to
yield significant changes in the refractive index. Furthermore, the refractive
index of biological tissue determines the way it interacts with light. Besides
the biological relevance of this interaction in the retina, a lot of methods
used in biology, including microscopy, rely on light-tissue or light-cell
interactions. Hence, determining the refractive index of cells using DHM is
valuable in many biological applications. This chapter covers the main topics
which are important for the implementation of DHM: setup, sample preparation
and analysis. First, the optical setup is described in detail including notes
and suggestions for the implementation. Following that, a protocol for the
sample and measurement preparation is explained. In the analysis section, an
algorithm for the determination of the quantitative phase map is described.
Subsequently, all intermediate steps for the calculation of the refractive
index of suspended cells are presented, exploiting their spherical shape. In
the last section, a discussion of possible extensions to the setup, further
measurement configurations and additional analysis methods are given.
Throughout this chapter, we describe a simple, robust, and thus easily
reproducible implementation of DHM. The different possibilities for extensions
show the diverse fields of application for this technique.

quantity that translates the payoff derived from game interactions into
reproductive success, is usually assumed to be a specific function of the
payoff. Meanwhile, the effect of different function forms of effective payoff
on evolutionary dynamics is always left in the basket. With introducing a
generalized mapping that the effective payoff of individuals is a non-negative
function of two variables on selection intensity and payoff, we study how
different effective payoff functions affect evolutionary dynamics in a
symmetrical mutation-selection process. For standard two-strategy two-player
games, we find that under weak selection the condition for one strategy to
dominate the other depends not only on the classical {\sigma}-rule, but also on
an extra constant that is determined by the form of the effective payoff
function. By changing the sign of the constant, we can alter the direction of
strategy selection. Taking the Moran process and pairwise comparison process as
specific models in well-mixed populations, we find that different fitness or
imitation mappings are equivalent under weak selection. Moreover, the sign of
the extra constant determines the direction of one-third law and risk-dominance
for sufficiently large populations. This work thus helps to elucidate how the
effective payoff function as another fundamental ingredient of evolution affect
evolutionary dynamics.

used in the stochastic ferrimagnetic LLB to simulate a $5\times10$ nm$^2$

Cartesian product of discretised spheres) entanglement. Unlike Meyer's earlier
discretisation of the Bloch Sphere, there are no orthonormal triples, hence the
Kocken-Specker theorem is not nullified. A physical interpretation of points on
the discretised Bloch sphere is given in terms of ensembles of trajectories on
a dynamically invariant fractal set in state space, where states of physical
reality correspond to points on the invariant set. This deterministic
construction provides a new way to understand the violation of the Bell

these conditions are defined solely from states on the invariant set. In this

this galaxy contains two dominant stellar populations of different age and
kinematics. The co-existence of multiple populations provides new constraints
on the dark halo structure of the galaxy, because different populations should
be in equilibrium in the same dark matter potential well. We develop
non-spherical dynamical models including such multiple stellar components and
attempt to constrain the properties of the non-spherical dark halo of Carina.
We find that Carina probably has a larger and denser dark halo than found in
previous works and a less cuspy inner dark matter density profile, even though
the uncertainties of dark halo parameters are still large due to small volume
of data sample. Using our fitting results, we evaluate astrophysical factors
for dark matter annihilation and decay and find that Carina should be one of
the most promising detectable targets among classical dSph galaxies. We also
calculate stellar velocity anisotropy profiles for both stellar populations and
find that they are both radially anisotropic in the inner regions, while in the
outer regions the older population becomes more tangentially biased than the
intermediate one. This is consistent with the anisotropy predicted from tidal
effects on the dynamical structure of a satellite galaxy and thereby can be
considered as kinematic evidence for the tidal evolution of Carina.

redshift, whereas the cosmological assembly of mass proceeds vice versa means
that radio sources have their strongest impact in the early Universe. Our
simulations suggest that radio sources heat hot halo gas, boost star formation
in disc galaxies and other cold gas in the vicinity, possibly filaments, by a
surround and squash mechanism. They might cause gaseous outflows in connection
with stellar feedback. This might be an important mode of star formation for
forming massive galaxies. Analysis of the jet-environment interaction may
provide insights into black-hole physics and jet formation, e.g., rotational
energy extraction (Blandford-Znajek) or how frequent black-hole binaries or
multiple systems are. The former relates to fundamental questions about the
nature of black holes. The latter is expected from hierarchical cosmology.

the telecommunications operators, not only in terms of cost, but also in terms
of operational reliability. A relation between the energy consumption and the
weather conditions would indicate that weather forecast models could be used
for predicting energy consumption of DCs. A reliable forecast would result in a
more efficient management of the available energy and would make it easier to
take advantage of the modern types of power-grid based on renewable energy
resources. In this ,paper, we exploit the capabilities provided by the
FIESTA-IoT platform in order to investigate the correlation between the weather
conditions and the energy consumption in DCs. Then, by using multi-variable
linear regression process, we model this correlation between the energy
consumption and the dominant weather conditions parameters in order to
effectively forecast the energy consumption based on the weather forecast. We
have validated our results through live measurements from the RealDC testbed.
Results from our proposed approach indicate that forecasting of energy
consumption based on weather conditions could help not only DC operators in
managing their cooling systems and power usage, but also electricity companies
in optimizing their power distribution systems.

turbulent flow is investigated. A channel flow simulation campaign involving
systematic variation of the streamwise ($\Delta x$) and spanwise ($\Delta z$)
grid resolution is used for this purpose. The main friction-velocity based
Reynolds number investigated is 300. Near the walls, the grid cell size is
determined by the frictional scaling, $\Delta x^+$ and $\Delta z^+$, and
strongly anisotropic cells, with first $\Delta y^+ \sim 1$, thus aiming for
wall-resolving LES. Results are compared to direct numerical simulations (DNS)
and several quality measures are investigated, including the error in the
predicted mean friction velocity and the error in cross-channel profiles of
flow statistics. To reduce the total number of channel flow simulations,
techniques from the framework of uncertainty quantification (UQ) are employed.
In particular, generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) is used to create
meta models for the errors over the allowed parameter ranges. The differing
behavior of the different quality measures is demonstrated and analyzed. It is
shown that friction velocity, and profiles of velocity and the Reynolds stress
tensor, are most sensitive to $\Delta z^+$, while the error in the turbulent
kinetic energy is mostly influenced by $\Delta x^+$. Recommendations for grid
resolution requirements are given, together with quantification of the
resulting predictive accuracy. The sensitivity of the results to subgrid-scale
(SGS) model and varying Reynolds number is also investigated. All simulations
are carried out with second-order accurate finite-volume based solver. The
choice of numerical methods and SGS model is expected to influence the
conclusions, but it is emphasized that the proposed methodology, involving
gPCE, can be applied to other modeling approaches as well.

influence the equilibrium shapes of precipitates. Additionally, mechanical
properties of the alloys are also dependent on the shapes of the precipitates.
Therefore, in order to investigate the mechanical response of a material which
undergoes precipitation during heat treatment, it is important to derive the
range of precipitate shapes that evolve. In this regard, several studies have
been conducted in the past using sharp interface approaches where the influence
of elastic energy anisotropy on the precipitate shapes has been investigated.
In this paper, we propose a diffuse interface approach which allows us to
minimize grid-anisotropy related issues applicable in sharp-interface methods.
In this context, we introduce a novel phase-field method where we minimize the
functional consisting of the elastic and surface energy contributions while
preserving the precipitate volume. Using this method we reproduce the
shape-bifurcation diagrams for the cases of pure dilatational misfit that have
been studied previously using sharp interface methods and then extend them to
include interfacial energy anisotropy with different anisotropy strengths which
has not been a part of previous sharp-interface models. While we restrict
ourselves to cubic anisotropies in both elastic and interfacial energies in
this study, the model is generic enough to handle any combination of
anisotropies in both the bulk and interfacial terms. Further, we have examined
the influence of asymmetry in dilatational misfit strains along with
interfacial energy anisotropy on precipitate morphologies.

$\mathcal L$ for the Calogero--Moser systems associated to an arbitrary Weyl
group $W$ (or an arbitrary finite reflection group in the rational case). This
interpretation also provides a companion matrix $\mathcal A$ so that $\mathcal
L, \mathcal A$ form a quantum Lax pair. Moreover, such an $\mathcal A$ can be
associated to any of the higher commuting quantum Hamiltonians of the system,
so we obtain a family of quantum Lax pairs. These Lax pairs can be of various
sizes, matching the sizes of orbits in the reflection representation of $W$,
and in the elliptic case they contain a spectral parameter. This way we
reproduce universal classical Lax pairs by D'Hoker-Phong and
Bordner-Corrigan-Sasaki, and complement them with quantum Lax pairs in all
cases (including the elliptic case, where they were not previously known). The
same method, with the Dunkl operators replaced by the Cherednik operators,
produces quantum Lax pairs for the generalised Ruijsenaars systems for
arbitrary root systems. As one of the main applications, we calculate a Lax
matrix for the elliptic $BC_n$ case with nine coupling constants (van Diejen
system), thus providing an answer to a long-standing open problem.

amplitudes at two epochs, however, we carried out investigation for amplitude
variability for only the MOST data. Amplitude variability was found for one of
three frequencies that satisfy the necessary frequency criteria for
linear-combination or resonant-mode coupling. Checking the criteria of beating
and resonant-mode coupling we excluded them as possible reason for amplitude
variability. The two recently developed methods of rotational-splitting and
sequence-search were applied to find regular spacings based only on
frequencies. Doublets or incomplete multiplets with l=1, 2 and 3 were found in
the rotational splitting search. In the sequence search method we identified
four sequences. The averaged spacing, probably a combination of the large
separation and the rotational frequency, is 1.724+/-0.092 d-1. Using the
spacing and the scaling relation $\bar\rho = [0.0394, 0.0554]$ gcm$^{-3}$ was
derived. The shift of the sequences proved to be the integer multiple of the

researched for several decades. One of the main challenges in tracking is to
adapt to object appearance changes over time and avoiding drifting to
background clutter. We address this challenge by proposing a deep neural
network composed of different parts, which functions as a society of tracking
parts. They work in conjunction according to a certain policy and learn from
each other in a robust manner, using co-occurrence constraints that ensure
robust inference and learning. From a structural point of view, our network is
composed of two main pathways. One pathway is more conservative. It carefully
monitors a large set of simple tracker parts learned as linear filters over
deep feature activation maps. It assigns the parts different roles. It promotes
the reliable ones and removes the inconsistent ones. We learn these filters
simultaneously in an efficient way, with a single closed-form formulation, for
which we propose novel theoretical properties. The second pathway is more
progressive. It is learned completely online and thus it is able to better
model object appearance changes. In order to adapt in a robust manner, it is
learned only on highly confident frames, which are decided using co-occurrences
with the first pathway. Thus, our system has the full benefit of two main
approaches in tracking. The larger set of simpler filter parts offers
robustness, while the full deep network learned online provides adaptability to
change. As shown in the experimental section, our approach achieves state of

published methods both on the general EAO metric and in the number of fails, by

publications for the intelligent processing of scientific texts extracted from
SciGraph. We compare the performance of domain-specific embeddings with
existing pre-trained vectors generated from very large and general purpose
corpora. Our results suggest that there is a trade-off between corpus
specificity and volume. Embeddings from domain-specific scientific corpora
effectively capture the semantics of the domain. On the other hand, obtaining
comparable results through general corpora can also be achieved, but only in
the presence of very large corpora of well formed text. Furthermore, We also
show that the degree of overlapping between knowledge areas is directly related
to the performance of embeddings in domain evaluation tasks.

each link having a capacity upper bound. Each sensor observes a discrete random
variable in private and one sensor serves as a cluster header or sink. Here, we
formulate the problem of how to let the sensors encode their observations such
that the direction of compressed data is a feasible flow towards the sink. We
demonstrate that this problem can be solved by an existing maximum independent
flow (MIF) algorithm in polynomial time. Further, we reveal that this algorithm
in fact determines an optimal solution by recursively pushing the remaining
randomness in the sources via unsaturated communication links towards the sink.
We then show that the MIF algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner.
For those networks with integral communication capacities, we propose an
integral MIF algorithm which completes much faster than MIF. Finally, we point
out that the nature of the data compression problem in a sensor cluster is to
seek the maximum independent information flow in the intersection of two
submodular polyhedra, which can be further utilized to improve the MIF
algorithm in the future.

the goal locations using a Markov decision process framework. Those

Solving the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, we consider a particularized

discuss some important properties of the charged sphere such as total electric
charge, mass-radius relation, surface redshift, and the speed of sound are
analyzed. Obtained solutions are presented by the graphical representation that
provides strong evidence for a more realistic and viable stellar structure.

cosmological solutions: a self-accelerating branch, which, except for the mass
of tensor modes has exactly the same behavior of linear perturbations as
$\Lambda$CDM in general relativity (GR), and a normal branch with nontrivial
behavior. We explore the influence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy
correlation constraints on the normal branch of MTMG, which, in its simplest
implementation, has one free parameter more than $\Lambda$CDM in GR (or the
self-accelerating branch of MTMG): $\theta$. This parameter is related to the
graviton mass and only affects the behavior of the cosmological linear
perturbation dynamics. Using 2d-mass and SDSS data, we check which values of
$\theta$ lead to a positive or negative cross-correlation. We find that
positive cross-correlation is achieved for a large parameter-space interval.
Within this allowed region of parameter space, we perform a $\chi^2$ analysis
in terms of the parameter $\theta$, while keeping the other background
parameters fixed to the best-fit values of Planck. We then infer that the
normal branch of MTMG fits the data well in a nontrivial portion of the

processes such as excitation and propagation of long wave packets in
dispersive, dissipative, bianisotropic media with weak and slow nonlinearity is
developed. The time-dependent EM fields associated with such processes are
expressed as products of two functions: the slowly varying complex amplitude
(SVCA) and the quickly oscillating carrier. The material parameters are treated
as operators acting on time-dependent EM fields. By expanding these operators
in the Maxwell equations in a series with respect to a small time scale
parameter a system of equations for the SVCAs of the EM fields in such media is
formulated. In the linear case, the dynamic equations for the SVCAs that
correspond to the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields
resemble the vector transmission line equations. The obtained system of
equations is used to derive the dyadic Green functions for the SVCAs of the EM
fields in bianisotropic media. This framework is applied for modeling
propagation of partially coherent EM radiation in a material whose parameters
may depend on the amount of the EM energy that has passed through it. The same
framework can be used in studying propagation of modulated EM waves through a
waveguiding system that includes bianisotropic metamaterial components.

smart grid, the application of fog computing can greatly facilitate the
collection of consumer's fine-grained energy consumption data, which can then
be used to draw the load curve and develop a plan or model for power
generation. However, such data may also reveal customer's daily activities.
Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) can monitor an electrical circuit that
powers a number of appliances switching on and off independently. If an
adversary analyzes the meter readings together with the data measured by an
NILM device, the customer's privacy will be disclosed. In this paper, we
propose an effective privacy-preserving scheme for electric load monitoring,
which can guarantee differential privacy of data disclosure in smart grid. In
the proposed scheme, an energy consumption behavior model based on Factorial
Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) is established. In addition, noise is added to the
behavior parameter, which is different from the traditional methods that
usually add noise to the energy consumption data. The analysis shows that the
proposed scheme can get a better trade-off between utility and privacy compared
with other popular methods.

form of insertion or deletion of edges or vertices. Such rapidly changing
graphs motivate us to study dynamic graph algorithms. However, three important
graph problems that are perhaps not sufficiently addressed in the literature
include independent sets, maximum matching (exact) and maximum flows.
  Maximal Independent Set (MIS) is one of the most prominently studied problems
in the distributed setting. Recently, the first dynamic MIS algorithm for
distributed networks was given by Censor-Hillel et al. [PODC16], requiring
expected $O(1)$ amortized rounds with $O(\Delta)$ messages per update, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph. They suggested an open
problem to maintain MIS in fully dynamic centralized setting more efficiently.
Assadi et al. [STOC18] presented a deterministic centralized fully dynamic MIS
algorithm requiring $O(\min\{\Delta,m^{3/4}\})$ amortized time per update. This
result is quite complex involving an exhaustive case analysis. We report a
surprisingly simple deterministic centralized algorithm which improves the
amortized update time to $O(\min\{\Delta,m^{2/3}\})$.
  Additionally, we present some other minor results related to dynamic MIS,
Maximum Flow, and Maximum Matching. A common trait of all our results is that
despite improving state of the art upper bounds or matching state of the art
lower bounds, they are surprisingly simple and are analysed using simple
amortization arguments. Further, they use no complicated data structures or
black box algorithms for their implementation.

Siamese similarity matching to account for actor deformations. Second, we

equation to describe the problem, while the parabolic dispersion of its
conduction and valence bands would invite a simpler Schr\""odinger equation
description. Here, we contrast the scattering of massive Dirac particles and
Schr\""odinger electrons, in order to assess different asymptotic regimes (low

regime of validity or transition. At low energies, where the dispersion is
approximately parabolic, the scattering processes are dominated by low angular
momentum channels, which results in nearly isotropic scattering amplitudes. On
the other hand, the differential cross section at high Fermi energies exhibits
clear signatures of the linear band dispersion, as the partial phase shifts
approach a non-zero value. We analyze the electronic dynamics by presenting
differential cross sections for both attractive and repulsive scattering
centers. The dissimilar behavior between Dirac and Schr\""odinger carriers

of hard X-ray radiation from a putative central source on the optically thick
walls of the accretion disk ""funnel""; and 2) due to scattering of the radiation

fluorescent line at 6.4 keV, for the relative nickel overabundance $Z_{Ni}/Z =
10$, as observed in the jets of SS 433. For the continuum model without the
absorption edge of neutral iron, we set a 90 per cent upper limit on the flux

(Stokes V) signal in its line profiles, interpreted in terms of a surface
magnetic field.
  The weak circular polarization signal has been monitored over 7.5 years in
order to follow its evolution on different timescales, and eventually to
determine its physical origin. Linear polarization measurements have also been
obtained regularly in the last few years.
  We used both the ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters to obtain high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra, which were processed by means of the
least-squares deconvolution (LSD) method. In order to ensure the reality of the
very weak circular polarization, special care has been taken to limit
instrumental effects. In addition, several tests were performed on the Stokes V
signal to establish its stellar and Zeeman origin.
  We confirm the magnetic nature of the circular polarization, pointing to a
surface magnetic field of the order of 1G. The Stokes V profiles present
variations over different timescales, the most prominent one being close to the
long secondary period (LSP; around 2000d for Betelgeuse) often invoked in red
evolved stars. This long period is also dominant for all the other Stokes
parameters. The circular polarization is tentatively modeled by means of
magnetic field concentrations mimicking spots, showing in particular that the
velocity associated with each ""spot"" also follows the long timescale, and that
this signal is nearly always slightly redshifted.
  From the coupled variations of both linear and circular polarization
signatures in amplitude, velocity and timescale, we favour giant convection
cells as the main engine at the origin of polarization signatures and
variations in all the Stokes parameters. This strengthens support for the
hypothesis that large convective cells are at the origin of the LSP.

of $\mathcal{O}_2$ are proved to be unitarily equivalent to one another.
Irreducible permutative representations of $\mathcal{Q}_2$ are classified in
terms of irreducible permutative representations of the Cuntz algebra. Apart
from the canonical representation of $\mathcal{Q}_2$, every irreducible
representation of $\mathcal{Q}_2$ is the unique extension of an irreducible
permutative representation of $\mathcal{O}_2$. Furthermore, a permutative
representation of $\mathcal{Q}_2$ will decompose into a direct sum of
irreducible permutative subrepresentations if and only if it restricts to
$\mathcal{O}_2$ as a regular representation in the sense of Bratteli-Jorgensen.
As a result, a vast class of pure states of $\mathcal{O}_2$ is shown to enjoy
the unique pure extension property with respect to the inclusion
$\mathcal{O}_2\subset\mathcal{Q}_2$.

rotations in space, we use previous results derived from Le Bihan and Mars
(2004) to prove that a Rayleigh-wave mode recorded by an array of
vector-sensors can be approximated by a sum of trace-by-trace rotating time
signals. Our method decomposes the signal into narrow-frequency bands, which
undergo both a velocity correction and a polarisation correction. The aim of
these corrections is to reduce the mode of interest to a quasi-monochromatic
wave packet with infinite apparent velocity and quasi-circular polarisation.
Once written in quaternion notation, we refer to this wave packet as
""quaternion brick"". Based on theoretical considerations, we prove that this
quaternion brick maps into the first quaternion eigenimage of the Quaternion
Singular Value Decomposition. We apply this method to synthetic datasets
derived from two vertically-heterogeneous models to extract the fundamental
mode and we prove that it is correctly separated from either a higher mode of
propagation or body waves with negligible residual. Results are presented in
both time-offset and frequency-phase slowness domains.

nonrotating black hole. The metric is presented as an expansion in powers of
r/b << 1, in which r is the distance to the black hole and b the characteristic
length scale of the tidal field --- the typical distance to the remote bodies
responsible for the tidal environment. The metric is expanded through order
(r/b)^4 and written in terms of a number of tidal multipole moments, the
gravitoelectric moments E_{ab}, E_{abc}, E_{abcd} and the gravitomagnetic
moments B_{ab}, B_{abc}, B_{abcd}. It differs from the similar construction of
Poisson and Vlasov in that the tidal perturbation is presented in Regge-Wheeler
gauge instead of the light-cone gauge employed previously. In the second part
of the paper we determine the tidal moments by matching the black-hole metric
to a post-Newtonian metric that describes a system of bodies with weak mutual
gravity. This extends the previous work of Taylor and Poisson (paper I in this
sequence), which computed only the leading-order tidal moments, E_{ab} and
B_{ab}. The matching is greatly facilitated by the Regge-Wheeler form of the
black-hole metric, and this motivates the work carried out in the first part of
the paper. The tidal moments are calculated accurately through the first
post-Newtonian approximation, and at this order they are independent of the
precise nature of the compact body. The moments therefore apply equally well to
a rotating black hole, or to a (rotating or nonrotating) neutron star. As an
application of this formalism, we examine the intrinsic geometry of a tidally
deformed event horizon, and describe it in terms of a deformation function that
represents a quadrupolar and octupolar tidal bulge.

known to harbour two massive giant planets: [...] Here we present new radial
velocity (RV) measurements secured over more than two years with the SOPHIE
spectrograph, where both planets are clearly detected. The RV data is modelled
together with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion
of velocity information breaks the $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy inherent in timing data
alone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and
masses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet
radii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c
respectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host
star system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at
better precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial
velocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting
planets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without
being limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and
eccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as
many transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been
measured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is
discussed. We show that the system is near a coplanar high-eccentricity secular
fixed point, related to the alignment of the orbits, which has prevented the
inner orbit from circularising. For most other relative apsidal orientations,
planet b's orbit would be circular with a semi-major axis of 0.03 au. This
suggests a mechanism for forming hot Jupiters in multiplanetary systems without
the need of high mutual inclinations.

the analysis of parametrised probabilistic systems is still in its infancy.
This is partly because it is much harder: while there are beautiful cut-off
results for non-stochastic systems that allow to focus only on small instances,
there is little hope that such approaches extend to the quantitative analysis
of probabilistic systems, as the probabilities depend on the size of a system.
The unicorn would be an automatic transformation of a parametrised system into
a formula, which allows to plot, say, the likelihood to reach a goal or the
expected costs to do so, against the parameters of a system. While such
analysis exists for narrow classes of systems, such as waiting queues, we aim
both lower---stepwise exploring the parameter space---and higher---considering
general systems.
  The novelty is to heavily exploit the similarity between instances of
parametrised systems. When the parameter grows, the system for the smaller
parameter is, broadly speaking, present in the larger system. We use this
observation to guide the elegant state-elimination method for parametric Markov
chains in such a way, that the model transformations will start with those
parts of the system that are stable under increasing the parameter. We argue
that this can lead to a very cheap iterative way to analyse parametric systems,
show how this approach extends to reconfigurable systems, and demonstrate on
two benchmarks that this approach scales.

After excitation, collective coupling gives rise to an intriguing many-body
quantum phenomenon, resulting in short, intense bursts of light: so-called
superfluorescence. Because it requires a fine balance of interaction between
the emitters and their decoupling from the environment, together with close
identity of the individual emitters, superfluorescence has thus far been
observed only in a limited number of systems, such as atomic and molecular

For colloidal nanocrystals, however, which are of increasing relevance in a

strength, and fast exciton dephasing. Using caesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X =

work in Weyl gauge, which fixes the rescaling invariance of the models, and
derive the linearized fourth-order equation of motion for the metric, which
describes massless and massive modes of propagation. In the limit of a large
graviton mass, MCG reduces to general relativity (GR), whereas CG does not.
Coordinates are fixed by Teyssandier gauge to show that for a conserved
energy-momentum tensor the gravitational radiation is due to the time-dependent
quadrupole moment of a non-relativistic source and we derive the gravitational
energy-momentum tensor for both models. We apply our findings to the case of
close binaries on circular orbits, which have been used to indirectly infer the
existence of gravitational radiation prior to the direct observation of
gravitational waves. As an example, we analyze the binary system PSR
J1012+5307, chosen for its small eccentricity. When fixing the graviton mass in
CG such that observed galaxy rotation curves could be explained without dark
matter, the gravitational radiation of a binary system is much smaller than in
GR. The same holds for MCG for small masses of the graviton. Thus gravitational
radiation cannot explain the orbital decay of binary systems and replace dark
matter simultaneously. We also analyse MCG for large graviton masses and
conclude that MCG can describe the orbital periods of compact binaries in
agreement with data, as it reduces to GR in that limit.

singularity theorems fail to give any information on the type or location of
the incomplete geodesics. Here, using recent results of Minguzzi, we prove a
new singularity theorem, specifically designed to apply to black holes, which
enables locating null incomplete geodesics within the black hole interior, all
the while allowing certain forms of chronology violation in the interior.

novel approximate analytical methodology to assess the performance of

characteristic time approximation and provides predictions that are
surprisingly accurate (hardly distinguishable from the simulations) in most of
the scenarios. Both synthetic and trace-driven results show that the our

to be the best performing polynomial algorithm under static and perfectly-known

pattern recognition, and data mining algorithms, which leads to the emergence
of metric learning field. Many metric learning algorithms learn a global
distance function from data that satisfy the constraints of the problem.
However, in many real-world datasets that the discrimination power of features
varies in the different regions of input space, a global metric is often unable
to capture the complexity of the task. To address this challenge, local metric
learning methods are proposed that learn multiple metrics across the different
regions of input space. Some advantages of these methods are high flexibility
and the ability to learn a nonlinear mapping but typically achieves at the
expense of higher time requirement and overfitting problem. To overcome these
challenges, this research presents an online multiple metric learning
framework. Each metric in the proposed framework is composed of a global and a
local component learned simultaneously. Adding a global component to a local
metric efficiently reduce the problem of overfitting. The proposed framework is
also scalable with both sample size and the dimension of input data. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first local online similarity/distance
learning framework based on PA (Passive/Aggressive). In addition, for
scalability with the dimension of input data, DRP (Dual Random Projection) is
extended for local online learning in the present work. It enables our methods
to be run efficiently on high-dimensional datasets, while maintains their
predictive performance. The proposed framework provides a straightforward local
extension to any global online similarity/distance learning algorithm based on
PA.

responsible for more deaths than breast, prostate, colon and pancreas cancer
combined and it has been recently demonstrated that low-dose computed
tomography (CT) screening of the chest can significantly reduce this death
rate.
  Objective: To compare the performance of a deep learning model to
state-of-the-art automated algorithms and radiologists as well as assessing the
robustness of the algorithm in heterogeneous datasets.
  Design, Setting, and Participants: Three low-dose CT lung cancer screening
datasets from heterogeneous sources were used, including National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST, n=3410), Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (LHMC,
n=3174) data, Kaggle competition data (from both stages, n=1595+505) and the
University of Chicago data (UCM, a subset of NLST, annotated by radiologists,
n=197). Relevant works on automated methods for Lung Cancer malignancy
estimation have used significantly less data in size and diversity. At the
first stage, our framework employs a nodule detector; while in the second
stage, we use both the image area around the nodules and nodule features as
inputs to a neural network that estimates the malignancy risk for the entire CT
scan. We trained our two-stage algorithm on a part of the NLST dataset, and
validated it on the other datasets.
  Results, Conclusions, and Relevance: The proposed deep learning model: (a)
generalizes well across all three data sets, achieving AUC between 86% to 94%;
(b) has better performance than the widely accepted PanCan Risk Model,
achieving 11% better AUC score; (c) has improved performance compared to the
state-of-the-art represented by the winners of the Kaggle Data Science Bowl

of many OB associations relies only on a relatively small number of massive
members. We study here the Sco OB1 association, with the aim of a better
characterization of its properties such as global size and shape, member
clusters and their morphology, age and formation history, and total mass. We
use deep optical and NIR photometry from the VPHAS+ and VVV surveys, over a
wide area (2.6 x 2.6 sq.deg.), complemented by Spitzer IR data, and Chandra and
XMM-Newton X-ray data. A new technique is developed to find clusters of
pre-main-sequence M-type stars using suitable color-color diagrams, which
complements existing selection techniques using narrow-band H-alpha photometry
or NIR and UV excesses, and X-ray data. We find a large population of
approximately 4000 candidate low-mass Sco OB1 members, net of field-star
contaminations, whose spatial properties correlate well with those of
H-alpha-emission, NIR-excess, UV-excess, and X-ray detected members, and
unresolved X-ray emission. The low-mass population is spread among several
interconnected subgroups: they coincide with the HII regions G345.45+1.50 and
IC4628, and the rich clusters NGC 6231 and Trumpler 24, with an additional
subcluster intermediate between these two. The total mass of Sco OB1 is
estimated to be 8500 Msun. Indication of a sequence of star-formation events is
found, from South (NGC 6231) to North (G345.45+1.50). We suggest that the
diluted appearance of Trumpler 24 indicates that the cluster is now dissolving
into the field, and that tidal stripping by NGC 6231 nearby contributes to the
process.

barrier, finding mobilities as high as 70,000 cm$^2$/Vs, compared to 100,000
cm$^2$/Vs measured in samples with no Ge layer. Activation energy measurements
in quantum Hall states corresponding to Fermi levels in the gap between
different valley states reveal energy gaps ranging from 30 to over 200 $\mu$eV,
and we extract a surprisingly strong dependence of the energy gap on electron
density. We interpret our results using tight binding theory and argue that our
results are evidence that atomic scale disorder at the quantum well interface
dominates the behavior of the valley splittings of these modified
heterostructures.

in the Solar neighbour disc stars, is still under debate. Recent accurate
measurements of position, velocity, and metallicity provided by Tycho Gaia
Astrometric Solution (TGAS) and RAdial Velocity Experiments (RAVE) have
revealed that the Hercules stream is most clearly seen in the metal-rich region
([Fe/H] > 0), while it is not clearly seen in lower metallicity region ([Fe/H]
< -0.25). By using a large number of chemo-dynamical 2D test-particle
simulations with a rotating bar and/or spiral arms, we find that the observed
[Fe/H] dependence of the Hercules stream is a natural consequence of the
inside-out formation of the stellar disc and the existence of highly non-closed
orbits in the rotating frame of the bar or spiral arms. Our successful models
that reproduce the observed properties of the Hercules stream include not only
fast-bar-only and fast-bar+spiral models, but also slow-bar+spiral models. This
indicates that it is very difficult to estimate the pattern speed of the bar or
spiral arms based only on the observations of the Hercules stream in the Solar
neighbourhood. As a by-product of our simulations, we make some predictions
about the locations across the Galactic plane where we can observe velocity
bimodality that is not associated with the Hercules stream. These predictions
can be tested by the Gaia Data Release 2, and such a test will improve our
understanding of the evolution of the Milky Way stellar disc.

paper we point out that magical explanations mean the end of the science.
Magical explanations are misleading and counterproductive. We explain how a
simple probabilistic locally causal model is able to reproduce quantum
correlations in Bell tests. We also discuss difficulties of mathematical
modelling of the physical reality and dangers of incorrect mental images. We
examine in detail when and how a probabilistic model may describe completely a
random experiment. We give some arguments in favor of contextual statistical
interpretation of quantum mechanics. We conclude that we still do not know
whether the quantum theory provides a complete description of physical
phenomena and we explain how it may be tested. We also point out that there
remain several open questions and challenges which we discuss in some detail.
In particular there is still no consensus about how to reconcile quantum theory
with general relativity and cosmology.

as American style options in most cases, which require a backward induction
valuation. To correct a common mistake in the literature, we emphasize that the
market value of a defaultable derivative is actually a risky value rather than
a risk-free value. Credit value adjustment (CVA) is also elaborated. A
practical framework is developed for pricing defaultable derivatives and
calculating their CVAs at a portfolio level.

infinite-dimensional manifold of diffeomorphisms. We present a new class of
optimization methods, valid for any optimization problem setup on the space of
diffeomorphisms by generalizing Nesterov accelerated optimization to the
manifold of diffeomorphisms. While our framework is general for infinite
dimensional manifolds, we specifically treat the case of diffeomorphisms,
motivated by optical flow problems in computer vision. This is accomplished by
building on a recent variational approach to a general class of accelerated
optimization methods by Wibisono, Wilson and Jordan, which applies in finite
dimensions. We generalize that approach to infinite dimensional manifolds. We
derive the surprisingly simple continuum evolution equations, which are partial
differential equations, for accelerated gradient descent, and relate it to
simple mechanical principles from fluid mechanics. Our approach has natural
connections to the optimal mass transport problem. This is because one can
think of our approach as an evolution of an infinite number of particles
endowed with mass (represented with a mass density) that moves in an energy
landscape. The mass evolves with the optimization variable, and endows the
particles with dynamics. This is different than the finite dimensional case
where only a single particle moves and hence the dynamics does not depend on
the mass. We derive the theory, compute the PDEs for accelerated optimization,
and illustrate the behavior of these new accelerated optimization schemes.

a rank 2 Kac--Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Our description is computationally
efficient, even in the rank 2 hyperbolic case where the coefficients of roots
on the root lattice grow exponentially with height. Our approach is to extend
Carter's method of finding structure constants from those on extraspecial pairs
to the rank 2 Kac--Moody case. We also determine all commutator relations
involving only real root vectors in all rank 2 Kac-Moody algebras. The
generalized Cartan matrix of $\mathfrak{g}$ is of the form $H(a,b)=
\left(\begin{smallmatrix} ~2 & -b\\ -a & ~2 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ where
$a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $ab\geq 4$. If $ab=4$, then $\mathfrak{g}$ is of affine
type. If $ab>4$, then $\mathfrak{g}$ is of hyperbolic type. Explicit knowledge
of the root strings is needed, as well as a characterization of the pairs of
real roots whose sums are real. We prove that if $a$ and $b$ are both greater
than one, then no sum of real roots can be a real root. We determine the root
strings between real roots $\beta,\gamma$ in $H(a,1)$, $a\geq 5$ and we
determine the sets $(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\alpha+\mathbb{Z}_{\geq
0}\beta)\cap\Delta^{\text{re}}(H(a,b))$. One of our tools is a characterization
of the root subsystems generated by a subset of roots. We classify these
subsystems in rank 2 Kac--Moody root systems. We prove that every rank two
infinite root system contains an infinite family of non-isomorphic symmetric
rank 2 hyperbolic root subsystems $H(k,k)$ for certain $k\geq 3$, generated by
either two short or two long simple roots. We also prove that a non-symmetric
hyperbolic root systems $H(a,b)$ with $a\ne b$ and $ab>5$ also contains an
infinite family of non-isomorphic non-symmetric rank 2 hyperbolic root
subsystems $H(a\ell,b\ell)$, for certain positive integers $\ell$.

Using these data, five parameters of the VTT model, defining the mold

satisfactory. Then the sensitivity of the numerical results of the VTT model is
analyzed by varying an input parameter. These investigations show that the VTT

An improved model is proposed with a new mathematical formulation. It is
inspired by the logistic equation whose parameters are estimated using the

conversion efficiency of the core/shell quantum dot nanocrystal (QDNC) solar
cells have been investigated in a detail manner. For this purpose, the
conventional, i.e original, detailed balance model, developed by Shockley and
Queisser to calculate an upper limit for conversion efficiency of silicon p-n
junction solar cells, is modified in a simple and an effective way and
calculated the conversion efficiency of core/shell QDNC solar cells. Since the
existing model relies on the gap energy ($E_g$) of the solar cell, it does not
make an estimation about the effect of QDNC materials on the efficiency of the
solar cells and gives the same efficiency values for several QDNC solar cells
with the same $E_g$. The proposed modification, however, estimates a conversion
efficiency in relation to the material properties and also confinement type of
the QDNCs. The results of the modified model show that, in contrast to the
original one, the conversion efficiencies of different QDNC solar cells, even
if they have the same $E_g$, become different depending upon the confinement
type and shell material of the core/shell QDNCs and this is crucial in design
and fabrication of the new generation solar cells to predict the confinement
type and also appropriate QDNC materials for better efficiency.

regions in the presence of a dynamical massless quantum matter scalar field
$\psi(r)$ and calculate canonical supper hamiltonian constraint on $t-$constant
hypersurface near the horizon $r=M(r)$. In this case $M(r)$ become geometrical
degrees of freedom while $\psi(r)$ is matter degrees of freedom of the apparent

oscillator which defined against the well known hermit polynomials. In the
latter case we obtain quantized mass of the SdS quantum black hole as
$\sqrt{\Lambda}M(n)=\big(\frac{2n+1}{12\sqrt{2}}\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ in which
$\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant and $n=0,1,2,\cdots $ are quantum
