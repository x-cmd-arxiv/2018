accuracy is often considered as a triumph of inflation. In this work, we
explore an alternative explanation for the power spectrum based on
nonperturbative quantum field-theoretical methods applied to Einstein's
gravity, instead of ones based on inflation models. In particular the power
spectral index, which governs the slope on the $P(k)$ graph, can be related to
critical scaling exponents derived from the Wilson renormalization group
analysis. We find that the derived value fits favorably with the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey telescope data. We then make use of the transfer functions, based
only on the Boltzmann equations which describe states out of equilibrium, and
Einstein's General Relativity, to extrapolate the power spectrum to the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) regime. We observe that the results fit rather well
with current data. Our approach contrasts with the conventional explanation
which uses inflation to generate the scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich
spectrum on CMB scales, and uses the transfer function to extrapolate it to
galaxy regime. The results we present here only assume quantum field theory and
Einstein's Gravity, and hence provide a competing explanation of the power
spectrum, without relying on the assumptions usually associated with
inflationary models. At the end, we also outline several testable predictions
in this picture that deviate from the conventional picture of inflation, and
which hopefully will become verifiable in the near future with increasingly
accurate measurements.

ranging from crystallization, melting and evaporation to the formation of

a challenging process to study in experiments especially in the early stage
when several atoms/molecules start to form a new phase from its parent phase.
Here, we advance atomic electron tomography to study early stage nucleation at
4D atomic resolution. Using FePt nanoparticles as a model system, we reveal
that early stage nuclei are irregularly shaped, each has a core of one to few
atoms with the maximum order parameter, and the order parameter gradient points
from the core to the boundary of the nucleus. We capture the structure and
dynamics of the same nuclei undergoing growth, fluctuation, dissolution,
merging and/or division, which are regulated by the order parameter
distribution and its gradient. These experimental observations differ from
classical nucleation theory (CNT) and to explain them we propose the order
parameter gradient (OPG) model. We show the OPG model generalizes CNT and
energetically favours diffuse interfaces for small nuclei and sharp interfaces
for large nuclei. We further corroborate this model using molecular dynamics
simulations of heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation in liquid-solid phase
transitions of Pt. We anticipate that the OPG model is applicable to different
nucleation processes and our experimental method opens the door to study the
structure and dynamics of materials with 4D atomic resolution.

Feynman integrands in between the recursion steps for the amplitude
construction. This method significantly reduces the complexity of scattering
amplitude calculations for multi-particle processes, leading to a major
increase in CPU efficiency and numerical stability. The unification of the
reduction to scalar integrals with the amplitude construction in a single

numerical instabilities in single recursion steps. A simple permutation trick
in combination with a one-parameter expansion for a single topology, which is
now implemented to any order, eliminate rank-two Gram determinant instabilities
altogether. Due to this any-order expansion, the numerical accuracy of the
algorithm can be determined with a rescaling test. The on-the-fly algorithm is
fully implemented for double and quadruple precision, which allows for true
quadruple precision benchmarks with up to 32 correct digits as well as a

At the theoretical level, we start from a general Lagrangian dynamically
capturing the evolution of a vortex ring and not only consider its spectrum of
linearized excitations, but also explore the full nonlinear dynamical evolution
of the ring as a vortical filament. The theory predicts that the ring is stable
for $1 \leq \lambda \leq 2$, where $\lambda=\omega_z/\omega_r$ is the ratio of
the trapping frequencies along the $z$ and $r$ axes, i.e., for spherical to
slightly oblate condensates. We compare this prediction with direct numerical
simulations of the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) capturing the
linearization spectrum of the ring for different values of the chemical
potential and as a function of the anisotropy parameter $\lambda$. We identify
this result as being only asymptotically valid as the chemical potential $\mu
\rightarrow \infty$, revealing how the stability interval narrows and, in
particular, its upper bound decreases for finite $\mu$. Finally, we compare at

learning the parameters of neural networks usually demands a large amount of
labeled data. The algorithms of deep learning, therefore, encounter
difficulties when applied to supervised learning where only little data are
available. This specific task is called few-shot learning. To address it, we
propose a novel algorithm for few-shot learning using discrete geometry, in the
sense that the samples in a class are modeled as a reduced simplex. The volume
of the simplex is used for the measurement of class scatter. During testing,
combined with the test sample and the points in the class, a new simplex is
formed. Then the similarity between the test sample and the class can be
quantized with the ratio of volumes of the new simplex to the original class
simplex. Moreover, we present an approach to constructing simplices using local
regions of feature maps yielded by convolutional neural networks. Experiments
on Omniglot and miniImageNet verify the effectiveness of our simplex algorithm
on few-shot learning.

components has been a central problem in large-scale data mining. While many
known algorithms have been developed for this problem, they are either not
scalable in practice or lack strong theoretical guarantees on the parallel
running time, that is, the number of communication rounds. So far, the best
proven guarantee is $\Oh(\log n)$, which matches the running time in the PRAM
model.
  In this paper, we aim to design a distributed algorithm for this problem that
works well in theory and practice. In particular, we present a simple algorithm
based on contractions and provide a scalable implementation of it in MapReduce.
On the theoretical side, in addition to showing $\Oh(\log n)$ convergence for
all graphs, we prove an $\Oh(\log \log n)$ parallel running time with high
probability for a certain class of random graphs. We work in the MPC model that
captures popular parallel computing frameworks, such as MapReduce, Hadoop or
Spark.
  On the practical side, we show that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art MapReduce algorithms. To confirm its scalability, we report
empirical results on graphs with several trillions of edges.

about data distribution, where data may represent stochastic observations in
robotics, transition state pairs in reinforcement learning or any other
empirically acquired modality. Inferring data pdf is of prime importance,
allowing to analyze various model hypotheses and perform smart decision making.
However, most density estimation techniques are limited in their representation
expressiveness to specific kernel type or predetermined distribution family,
and have other restrictions. For example, kernel density estimation (KDE)
methods require meticulous parameter search and are extremely slow at querying
new points. In this paper we present a novel non-parametric density estimation
approach, DeepPDF, that uses a neural network to approximate a target pdf given
samples from thereof. Such a representation provides high inference accuracy
for a wide range of target pdfs using a relatively simple network structure,
making our method highly statistically robust. This is done via a new
stochastic optimization algorithm, \emph{Probabilistic Surface Optimization}
(PSO), that turns to advantage the stochastic nature of sample points in order
to force network output to be identical to the output of a target pdf. Once
trained, query point evaluation can be efficiently done in DeepPDF by a simple
network forward pass, with linear complexity in the number of query points.
Moreover, the PSO algorithm is capable of inferring the frequency of data
samples and may also be used in other statistical tasks such as conditional
estimation and distribution transformation. We compare the derived approach
with KDE methods showing its superior performance and accuracy.

general equation for the Hubble parameter is obtained with the presence of a
cosmological constant. The existence of de Sitter solutions is discussed, where
a wider range of solutions is found in comparison to the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Also the conditions for the near thermodynamical equilibrium of the fluid is
analysed. Finally, a qualitative analysis provides some constraints on the

idea that having a more accurate shape and appearance model leads to more
accurate image registration, which in turn leads to a more accurate shape and
appearance model. This leads naturally to an iterative scheme, which is based
on a probabilistic generative model that is fit using Gauss-Newton updates
within an EM-like framework. It was developed with the aim of enabling
distributed privacy-preserving analysis of brain image data, such that shared
information (shape and appearance basis functions) may be passed across sites,
whereas latent variables that encode individual images remain secure within
each site. These latent variables are proposed as features for
privacy-preserving data mining applications.
  The approach is demonstrated qualitatively on the KDEF dataset of 2D face
images, showing that it can align images that traditionally require shape and
appearance models trained using manually annotated data (manually defined
landmarks etc.). It is applied to MNIST dataset of handwritten digits to show
its potential for machine learning applications, particularly when training
data is limited. The model is able to handle ``missing data'', which allows it
to be cross-validated according to how well it can predict left-out voxels. The
suitability of the derived features for classifying individuals into patient
groups was assessed by applying it to a dataset of over 1,900 segmented
T1-weighted MR images, which included images from the COBRE and ABIDE datasets.

the mean longitudinal magnetic field in stars (H_ eff) from polarized spectra
of high resolution, through the inversion of the so-called multi-line profiles.
  Using synthetic data, we tested the performance of our technique considering
different noise levels: In an ideal scenario of noise-free multi-line profiles,
the inversion results are excellent; however, the accuracy of the inversions
diminish considerably when noise is taken into account. In consequence, we
propose a data pre-process in order to reduce the noise impact, which consists
in a denoising profile process combined with an iterative inversion
methodology.
  Applying this data pre-process, we have found a considerable improvement of
the inversions results, allowing to estimate the errors associated to the

curve (2D), or a surface (3D), matching the volume fractions and finding the
curvature by differentiation. Here, a different approach is examined. A
synthetic data set, relating curvature to volume fractions, is generated using
well-defined shapes where the curvature and volume fractions are easily found
and then machine learning is used to fit the data (training). The resulting
function is used to find the curvature for shapes not used for the training and
implemented into a code to track moving interfaces. The results suggest that
using machine learning to generate the relationship is a viable approach that
results in reasonably accurate predictions.

behaviour of natural and forced separating/reattaching flows developing behind
bluff bodies, potentially paving the way to new, scalable separation control
strategies. In this perspective, we propose a new interpretative framework for
separated flows, based on mass entrainment. The cornerstone of the approach is
an original model of the mean flow, representing it as a stationary vortex
scaling with the mean recirculation length. We test our model on a set of mean
separated topologies, obtained by forcing the flow over a descending ramp with
a rack of synthetic jets. Our results show that both the circulation of the
vortex and its characteristic size scale simply with the intensity of the
backflow (i.e. the amount of mass going through the recirculation region). This
suggests that the vortex model captures the essential functioning of mean mass
entrainment, and that it could be used to model and/or predict the mean
properties of separated flows. In addition, we use the vortex model to show
that the backflow (i.e. an integral quantity) can be estimated from a single
wall-pressure measurement (i.e. a pointwise quantity). Since the backflow also
appears to be anticorrelated to the characteristic velocity of the synthetic
jets, this finding suggests that industrially deployable, closed-loop control
systems based on mass entrainment might be within reach.

simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we
estimate that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million
dollars. Scaling the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities needed for

combinatorial optimization problems such as max/min-cut, max-flow problems etc.
Due to the vast number of elements typically found in this problem domain,
these problems are computationally intractable leading to the use of
approximate solutions. In this work, we explore the Ising spin glass model as a
solution methodology for hard combinatorial optimization problems using the
general purpose GPU (GPGPU). The Ising model is a mathematical model of
ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. Ising computing finds a minimum energy
state for the Ising model which essentially corresponds to the expected optimal
solution of the original problem. Many combinatorial optimization problems can
be mapped into the Ising model. In our work, we focus on the max-cut problem as
it is relevant to many VLSI physical design problems. Our method is inspired by
the observation that Ising annealing process is very amenable to fine-grain
massive parallel GPU computing. We will illustrate how the natural randomness
of GPU thread scheduling can be exploited during the annealing process to

Furthermore, the proposed GPU-based Ising computing can handle any general
Ising graph with arbitrary connections, which was shown to be difficult for
existing FPGA and other hardware based implementation methods. Numerical
results show that the proposed GPU Ising max-cut solver can deliver more than
2000X speedup over the CPU version of the algorithm on some large examples,
which shows huge performance improvement for addressing many hard optimization
algorithms for practical VLSI physical design.

segmentation of cardiac MR (CMR) images in patients with pulmonary hypertension
(PH). The proposed method explicitly takes into account the image features
learned from a deep neural network. To this end, we estimate simultaneous
probability maps over region and edge locations in CMR images using a fully
convolutional network. Due to the distinct morphology of the heart in patients
with PH, these probability maps can then be incorporated in a single nested
level set optimisation framework to achieve multi-region segmentation with high
efficiency. The proposed method uses an automatic way for level set
initialisation and thus the whole optimisation is fully automated. We
demonstrate that the proposed deep nested level set (DNLS) method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods for CMR segmentation in PH patients.

Molecules such as water and carbon monoxide have been unambiguously identified
in hot gas giants through cross- correlation techniques. A maximum in the
cross-correlation function (CCF) is found when the molecular absorption lines
in a binary mask or model template match those contained in the planet. Here,
we demonstrate how the CCF method can be used to diagnose broad-band
spectroscopic features such as scattering by aerosols in high-resolution
transit spectra. The idea consists in exploiting the presence of multiple water
bands from the optical to the near-infrared. We produced a set of models of a
typical hot Jupiter spanning various conditions of temperature and aerosol
coverage. We demonstrate that comparing the CCFs of individual water bands for
the models constrains the presence and the properties of the aerosol layers.
The contrast difference between the CCFs of two bands can reach about 100 ppm,
which could be readily detectable with current or upcoming high-resolution
stabilized spectrographs spanning a wide spectral range, such as ESPRESSO,
CARMENES, HARPS-N+GIANO, HARPS+NIRPS, SPIRou or CRIRES+.

by transforming the single-particle orbitals in a configuration-dependent way.
NNB uses a feed-forward neural network to find the optimal transformation. NNB
directly dresses a mean-field state, can be systematically improved and
directly alters the sign structure of the wave-function. It generalizes the
standard backflow which we show how to explicitly represent as a NNB. We
benchmark the NNB on a Hubbard model at intermediate doping finding that it
significantly decreases the relative error, restores the symmetry of both

density. Finally, we illustrate interesting patterns in the weights and bias of

disordered semiconductors - and arises from considerations of spatially
inhomogeneous solutions of the gap equation. So long as the clean-limit
superconducting coherence length, $\xi_0$, is large compared to disorder
correlation length, $a$, when fluctuations about mean-field theory are
considered, the effects of such rare events are small (typically exponentially
in $[\xi_0/a]^d$); however, when this ratio is $\sim 1$, these considerations
are important. The linearized gap equation is solved numerically for various

that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential
reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore,
stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and
evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters,
ranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations
can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers,
certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This
UBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and
estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities
create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common
isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters
using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the
photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes
find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older (>100 Myr) clusters,
like the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium
depletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within
~10% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the
Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with
lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly
diverge to become 30% to 80% younger. This illustrates the importance of
rotation for deriving ages in the youngest (<100 Myr) clusters.

photons in the magnetosphere, giving rise to novel features in the X-ray
spectrum. Since ALPs only mix with the parallel mode of the photon, the
polarization of the soft and hard X-ray spectra is predicted to have an O-mode
component, in addition to the mainly X-mode component given by most
astrophysical models. The relative strength of the O-mode component depends on
the intensity of ALPs produced in the core and the probability of conversion.
We quantify our results by considering X-ray emission produced both by
astrophysical processes and by ALP-photon conversion, in an uncorrelated
fashion, and in different relative proportions, which we parametrize by the
angle $\chi_0$. We then define a normalized astrophysics-subtracted Stokes
parameter $R$ which only acquires non-zero values in the presence of ALP-photon
conversion. We find, remarkably, that the parameter $R$ factorizes into a
product of the ALP-to-photon conversion probability and $\cos(2\chi_0)$ and
display $R$, as well as the usual Stokes parameter $Q$, as a function of the
photon energy and relative fractions of ALP and photon intensities. For
benchmark points currently allowed by the CAST experiment, the O-mode
prediction can be tested in future X-ray polarimeters and used either to
constrain ALPs or find evidence for them.

in the NUV LFs for clusters having low and high X-ray luminosities and for
sparse and dense clusters, though none are particularly well fitted by the

When splitting clusters into two subsamples by X-ray luminosity, the ratio of
low to high NUV luminosity galaxies is higher in the high X-ray luminosity
subsample (i.e the luminosity function is steeper across the sampled luminosity
range). In subsamples split by surface density, when characterised by Schechter

Three mechanisms have been proposed for such polarized emission: grain
alignment with magnetic fields, grain alignment with radiation gradients, and
self-scattering of thermal dust emission. Aiming to observationally identify
the polarization mechanisms, we present ALMA polarization observations of the
0.87 mm dust continuum emission toward the circumstellar disk around HD 142527
with high spatial resolution. We confirm that the polarization vectors in the
northern region are consistent with self-scattering. Furthermore, we show that
the polarization vectors in the southern region are consistent with grain
alignment by magnetic fields, although self-scattering cannot be ruled out. To
understand the differences between the polarization mechanisms, we propose a
simple grain size segregation model: small dust grains ($\lesssim$ 100 microns)
are dominant and aligned with magnetic fields in the southern region, and
middle-sized ($\sim100$ microns) grains in the upper layer emit self-scattered
polarized emission in the northern region. The grain size near the middle plane
in the northern region cannot be measured because the emission at 0.87 mm is
optically thick. However, it can be speculated that larger dust grains
($\gtrsim$ cm) may accumulate near this plane. These results are consistent
with those of a previous analysis of the disk, in which large grain
accumulation and optically thick emission from the northern region were found.
This model is also consistent with theories where smaller dust grains are
aligned with magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are toroidal, at least in the
southern region.

used to build optoelectronic devices. However, as a hygroscopic water-based
acidic material, it brings major concerns for stability and degradation,
resulting in an intense effort to replace it in organic photovoltaic (OPV)
devices. In this work, we focus on the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) polymeric
additive to PEDOT:PSS. We demonstrate that it can reduce the relative amplitude
of OPV device burn-in, and find two distinct regimes of influence. At low
concentrations there is a subtle effect on wetting and work function, for
instance, with a detrimental impact on the device characteristics, and above a
threshold it changes the electronic and device properties. The abrupt threshold
in the conducting polymer occurs for PFI concentrations greater than or equal
to the PSS concentration and was revealed by monitoring variations in
transmission, topography, work-function, wettability and OPV device
characteristics. Below this PFI concentration threshold, the power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of OPVs based on
poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
(P3HT:PCBM) are impaired largely by low fill-factors due to poor charge
extraction. Above the PFI concentration threshold, we recover the PCE before it
is improved beyond the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer based OPV devices.
Supplementary to the performance enhancement, PFI improves OPV device stability
and lifetime. Our degradation study leads to the conclusion that PFI prevents
water from diffusing to and from the hygrosopic PEDOT:PSS layer, which slows
down the deterioration of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the aluminum electrode. These
findings reveal mechanisms and opportunities that should be taken into
consideration when developing components to inhibit OPV degradation.

supervised learning would require an impractically large amount of

tested on unseen problems. Deviation of the student's solutions from the
optimality conditions is quantified, and used for choosing new data points to
learn from. We call this learning mechanism ""theory-driven"", as it explicitly
uses domain-specific theories to guide the learning, thus distinguishing itself
from purely data-driven supervised learning. We show through a compliance

number of a flexible sphere cluster in $\mathbb{R}^3$, using a definition of
symmetry that arises naturally when calculating the equilibrium probability of
a cluster of spheres in the sticky-sphere limit. We define the sticky symmetry
group of the cluster as the set of permutations and inversions of the spheres
which preserve adjacency and can be realized by continuous deformations of the
cluster that do not change the set of contacts or cause particles to overlap.
The symmetry number is the size of the sticky symmetry group. We introduce a
numerical algorithm to compute the sticky symmetry group and symmetry number,
and show it works well on several test cases. Furthermore we show that once the
sticky symmetry group has been calculated for indistinguishable spheres, the
symmetry group for partially distinguishable spheres (those with non-identical
interactions) can be efficiently obtained without repeating the laborious parts
of the computations. We use our algorithm to calculate the partition functions
of every possible connected cluster of 6 identical sticky spheres, generating
data that may be used to design interactions between spheres so they
self-assemble into a desired structure.

in recent works, ${\it viz.}$ (case 1) the QCD lagrangian evaluated via lattice

lagrangian makes use of the gluon content of the nucleon entering in terms of
the gluon trace-anomaly and ignores the effects of $q{\bar q}$ vacuum
polarization, whereas in spontaneous symmetry breaking masses are formed by
attaching $q{\bar q}$ pairs to the valence quarks, thus giving them a definite
mass which is named the constituent mass. By the same process the $q{\bar q}$
pairs of the vacuum polarization acquire mass and in this form are the elements
of the quark condensate, having an up-quark and a down-quark component. A
linear combination of these two components in the form
$\sigma=1/\sqrt{2}(u{\bar u} + d{\bar d})$ shows up as the $\sigma$ field. It
is shown that (case i) corresponds to an unstable nucleon configuration whereas
(case ii) corresponds to a stable nucleon configuration as observed in
low-energy photo-nuclear and pion-nuclear reactions.

inversion symmetry associated with distortions of the metal-halide octahedra,
the Rashba effect (used \textit{e.g.} in spin field-effect transistors and spin
filters) has been predicted to be much larger in these materials than in
traditional III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, supported by the recent
observation of a near record Rashba spin splitting in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). More experimental
studies are needed to confirm and quantify the presence of Rashba effects in
the organic-inorganic perovskite family of materials. Here we apply
time-resolved circular dichroism techniques to the study of carrier spin
dynamics in a 2D perovskite thin film [(BA)$_2$MAPb$_2$I$_7$; BA =
CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_3$NH$_3$, MA = CH$_3$NH$_3$]. Our findings confirm the presence
of a Rashba spin splitting via the dominance of precessional spin relaxation
induced by the Rashba effective magnetic field. The size of the Rashba spin
splitting in our system was extracted from simulations of the measured spin
dynamics incorporating LO-phonon and electron-electron scattering, yielding a
value of 10 meV at an electron energy of 50 meV above the band gap,

authors. Publishing in prestigious journal plays a decisive role for authors in
hiring and promotions. In last decade, citation pressure has become intact for
all scientific entities more than ever before. Unethical publication practices
has started to manipulate widely used performance metric such as ""impact
factor"" for journals and citation based indices for authors. This threatens the
integrity of scientific quality and takes away deserved credit of legitimate
authors and their authentic publications.
  In this paper we extract all possible anomalous citation patterns between
journals from a Computer Science bibliographic dataset which contains more than
2,500 journals. Apart from excessive self-citations, we mostly focus on finding
several patterns between two or more journals such as bi-directional mutual
citations, chains, triangles, mesh, cartel relationships. On a macroscopic
scale, the motivation is to understand the nature of these patterns by modeling
how journals mutually interact through citations. On microscopic level, we
differentiate between possible intentions (good or bad) behind such patterns.
We see whether such patterns prevail for long period or during any specific
time duration. For abnormal citation behavior, we study the nature of sudden
inflation in impact factor of journals on a time basis which may occur due to
addition of irrelevant and superfluous citations in such closed pattern
interaction. We also study possible influences such as abrupt increase in paper
count due to the presence of self-referential papers or duplicate manuscripts,
author self-citation, author co-authorship network, author-editor network,
publication houses etc. The entire study is done to question the reliability of
existing bibliometrics, and hence, it is an urgent need to curtail their usage

source. Images captured by moving or still cameras are inevitably affected by
motion blur due to relative movements between sensors and objects. In this

We propose a deep gated fusion convolution neural network to generate a clear

decomposing the feature extraction step into two task-independent streams, the
dual-branch design can facilitate the training process by avoiding learning the
mixed degradation all-in-one and thus enhance the final high-resolution

measure an average sky background of 20 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the 579-642 nm
bandpass. We built the lightcurves of 6000 stars and developed a model to infer
the photometric quality of Dome C from the lightcurves themselves. The weather
is photometric $67.1\pm4.2$ % of the time and veiled $21.8\pm2.0$ % of the

analyzed the lightcurves of $\sigma$ Oct and HD 184465 and find that the
amplitude of their main frequency varies by a factor of 3.5 and 6.7 over the

each interval there is an increasing sequence of eigenvalues that are indexed
by the number of roots of the associated eigenfunction. One consequence of this
is that it guarantees that the spectrum of these operator pencils has finite
accumulation points, implying that the operators do not have compact

several species dispersal models arising in biology.

the optimization of deep learning segmentation or detection models on data sets
with extreme class imbalance. We evaluate the CASED learning framework on the
task of lung nodule detection in chest CT. In contrast to two-stage solutions,
wherein nodule candidates are first proposed by a segmentation model and
refined by a second detection stage, CASED improves the training of deep nodule
segmentation models (e.g. UNet) to the point where state of the art results are
achieved using only a trivial detection stage. CASED improves the optimization
of deep segmentation models by allowing them to first learn how to distinguish
nodules from their immediate surroundings, while continuously adding a greater
proportion of difficult-to-classify global context, until uniformly sampling
from the empirical data distribution. Using CASED during training yields a
minimalist proposal to the lung nodule detection problem that tops the LUNA16
nodule detection benchmark with an average sensitivity score of 88.35%.
Furthermore, we find that models trained using CASED are robust to nodule
annotation quality by showing that comparable results can be achieved when only
a point and radius for each ground truth nodule are provided during training.
Finally, the CASED learning framework makes no assumptions with regard to
imaging modality or segmentation target and should generalize to other medical
imaging problems where class imbalance is a persistent problem.

standard Young tableaux and were introduced by Assaf and Searles to tighten
Gessel's fundamental quasisymmetric expansion of Schur functions. The descent
set and descent statistic of standard Young tableaux repeatedly prove
themselves useful to consider, and as a result, quasi-Yamanouchi tableaux make
appearances in many ways outside of their original purpose. Some examples,

Frobenius image of the coinvariant algebra. While it would be nice to have a
product formula enumeration of quasi-Yamanouchi tableaux in the way that
semistandard and standard Young tableaux do, it has previously been shown by
the author that there is little hope on that front. The goal of this paper is
to address a handful of the numerous alternative enumerative approaches. In

different morphological phenotypes corresponding to different migration modes.
As a result, cell morphodynamics is mapped into temporal evolution of
morphological phenotypes. We systematically characterize the phenotype
evolutions including occurrence probability, dwell time, transition flux, and
3D migrational characteristics. We find that manipulating Rho-signaling
enhances the morphodynamics and phenotype transitions. Using a tumor organoid

the phenotype homeostasis. Overall invasion of a tumor organoid is facilitated
by individual cells searching for and committing to phenotypes of higher
invasive potential. In conclusion, we show that 3D migrating cancer cells

divergence term and a TV regularizer, subject to nonnegativity and possibly
other constraints, such as flux conservation. ACQUIRE is a line-search method
that considers a smoothed version of TV, based on a Huber-like function, and
computes the search directions by minimizing quadratic approximations of the
problem, built by exploiting some second-order information. A classical
second-order Taylor approximation is used for the Kullback-Leibler term and an
iteratively reweighted norm approach for the smoothed TV term. We prove that
the sequence generated by the method has a subsequence converging to a
minimizer of the smoothed problem and any limit point is a minimizer.
Furthermore, if the problem is strictly convex, the whole sequence is
convergent. We note that convergence is achieved without requiring the exact
minimization of the quadratic subproblems; low accuracy in this minimization
can be used in practice, as shown by numerical results. Experiments on
reference test problems show that our method is competitive with
well-established methods for TV-based Poisson image restoration, in terms of
both computational efficiency and image quality.

  Variance Bounds on the Estimated Canonical Volume Form",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anatomy is undergoing a renaissance driven by availability of large digital
data sets generated by light microscopy. A central computational task is to map
individual data volumes to standardized templates. This is accomplished by
regularized estimation of a diffeomorphic transformation between the coordinate
systems of the individual data and the template, building the transformation
incrementally by integrating a smooth flow field. The canonical volume form of
this transformation is used to quantify local growth, atrophy, or cell density.
While multiple implementations exist for this estimation, less attention has
been paid to the variance of the estimated diffeomorphism for noisy data.
Notably, there is an infinite dimensional un-observable space defined by those
diffeomorphisms which leave the template invariant. These form the stabilizer
subgroup of the diffeomorphic group acting on the template. The corresponding
flat directions in the energy landscape are expected to lead to increased
estimation variance. Here we show that a least-action principle used to
generate geodesics in the space of diffeomorphisms connecting the subject brain
to the template removes the stabilizer. This provides reduced-variance
estimates of the volume form. Using simulations we demonstrate that the
asymmetric large deformation diffeomorphic mapping methods (LDDMM), which
explicitly incorporate the asymmetry between idealized template images and
noisy empirical images, provide lower variance estimators than their
symmetrized counterparts (cf. ANTs). We derive Cramer-Rao bounds for the
variances in the limit of small deformations. Analytical results are shown for
the Jacobian in terms of perturbations of the vector fields and divergence of
the vector field.

resonances with their neighbors. Prior to the measurement of 1h's period, Luger
et al. (2017) showed that six possible and highly precise periods for 1h were
expected, assuming it also participated in the resonant chain. We show here
that combining this argument with a Titius-Bode law fit of the inner six worlds
narrows the choices down to a single precise postdiction for 1h's period, which
is ultimately the correct period. But a successful postdiction is never as
convincing as a successful prediction, and so we take the next step and apply
this argument to a hypothetical TRAPPIST-1i. We find two possible periods
predicted by this argument, either 25.345 or 28.699 days. If successful, this
may provide the basis for planet prediction in compact resonant chain systems.
If falsified, this would indicate that the argument lacks true predictive power

a superposition of delta-shell potentials sampling the interaction with the

bifurcations of bound dark solitons are bound solitonic vortices. Among them,
both two-open and two-ring vortex lines are demonstrated to exist with both

evolve, for high chemical potential, into a stationary 3D-chain-shaped vortex

molecule (Shin-Metiu model) in which nuclear, electronic and photonic degrees
of freedom are treated on the same footing. This simplified model allows the
comparison of exact quantum reaction rate calculations with predictions
emerging from transition state theory based on the cavity Born-Oppenheimer

modify activation barriers in chemical reactions and, as a consequence,
reaction rates. The critical physical parameter controlling this effect is the
permanent dipole of the molecule and how this magnitude changes along the
reaction coordinate. We show that the effective coupling can lead to
significant single-molecule energy shifts in an experimentally available
nanoparticle-on-mirror cavity. We then apply the validated theory to a
realistic case (internal rotation in the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule), showing
how reactions can be inhibited or catalyzed depending on the profile of the
molecular dipole. Furthermore, we discuss the absence of resonance effects in
this process, which can be understood through its connection to Casimir-Polder
forces. Finally, we treat the case of many-molecule strong coupling, and find
collective modifications of reaction rates if the molecular permanent dipole
moments are oriented with respected to the cavity field. This demonstrates that
collective coupling can also provide a mechanism for modifying ground-state
chemical reactivity of an ensemble of molecules coupled to a cavity mode.

sophisticated cognitive capabilities and a naturally tunable level of

maximizing objectives (such as a predator always chasing after the closest
prey). However, random behavior is too simplistic in many circumstances and
greedy algorithms, as well as classic AI planning techniques, can be brittle in
the context of the unpredictable and emergent situations in which agents may
find themselves. Our method, called agent-centric Monte Carlo cognition
(ACMCC), centers around using a separate agent-based model to represent the
agents' cognition. This model is then used by the agents in the primary model
to predict the outcomes of their actions, and thus guide their behavior. To
that end, we have implemented our method in the NetLogo agent-based modeling
platform, using the recently released LevelSpace extension, which we developed
to allow NetLogo models to interact with other NetLogo models. As an
illustrative example, we extend the Wolf Sheep Predation model (included with
NetLogo) by using ACMCC to guide animal behavior, and analyze the impact on
agent performance and model dynamics. We find that ACMCC provides a reliable
and understandable method of controlling agent intelligence, and has a large
impact on agent performance and model dynamics even at low settings.

measures electron density information for x-ray photons, MR images convey
information about the magnetic properties of tissues. Therefore, with the
advent of PET-MR systems, the attenuation coefficients need to be indirectly
estimated from MR images. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional
neural network (CNN) based method to synthesize head CT from ultra-short
echo-time (UTE) dual-echo MR images. Unlike traditional $T_1$-w images which do
not have any bone signal, UTE images show some signal for bone, which makes it
a good candidate for MR to CT synthesis. A notable advantage of our approach is
that accurate results were achieved with a small training data set. Using an
atlas of a single CT and dual-echo UTE pair, we train a deep neural network
model to learn the transform of MR intensities to CT using patches. We compared
our CNN based model with a state-of-the-art registration based as well as a
Bayesian model based CT synthesis method, and showed that the proposed CNN
model outperforms both of them. We also compared the proposed model when only

for many applications including automatic parallelization, race detection,
computation and communication overlap, verification, and shape analysis. For
sparse matrix codes, array data dependence analysis is made more difficult by
the use of index arrays that make it possible to store only the nonzero entries
of the matrix (e.g., in A[B[i]], B is an index array). Here, dependence
analysis is often stymied by such indirect array accesses due to the values of
the index array not being available at compile time. Consequently, many
dependences cannot be proven unsatisfiable or determined until runtime.
Nonetheless, index arrays in sparse matrix codes often have properties such as
monotonicity of index array elements that can be exploited to reduce the amount
of runtime analysis needed. In this paper, we contribute a formulation of array
data dependence analysis that includes encoding index array properties as
universally quantified constraints. This makes it possible to leverage existing
SMT solvers to determine whether such dependences are unsatisfiable and
significantly reduces the number of dependences that require runtime analysis
in a set of eight sparse matrix kernels. Another contribution is an algorithm
for simplifying the remaining satisfiable data dependences by discovering
equalities and/or subset relationships. These simplifications are essential to
make a runtime-inspection-based approach feasible.

that vacancy defects and the inclusion of relativistic spin-orbit coupling in

assimilation approach based on two nested ensemble Kalman filters is proposed
for inferring parameters associated with a stochastic parameterization. The
proposed technique is based on the Rao-Blackwellization of the parameter
estimation problem. The technique consists in using an ensemble of ensemble
Kalman filters, each of them using a different set of stochastic parameter
values. We show the ability of the technique to infer parameters related to the
covariance structure of stochastic representations of model error in the
Lorenz-96 dynamical system. The evaluation is conducted with stochastic twin
experiments and imperfect model experiments with unresolved physics in the
forecast model. The proposed technique performs successfully under different

among competing agents that are coupled through such shared resources and are
constrained --- either through limitations of communication infrastructure or
privacy considerations. We propose a distributed algorithm to solve such
distributed multi-resource allocation problems with no direct inter-agent
communication. We do so by extending a recently introduced additive-increase
multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm, which only uses very little
communication between the system and agents. Namely, a control unit broadcasts
a one-bit signal to agents whenever one of the allocated resources exceeds
capacity. Agents then respond to this signal in a probabilistic manner. In the
proposed algorithm, each agent makes decision of its resource demand locally
and an agent is unaware of the resource allocation of other agents. In
empirical results, we observe that the average allocations converge over time
to optimal allocations.

  Structural Models",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When making causal inferences, post-treatment confounders complicate analyses
of time-varying treatment effects. Conditioning on these variables naively to
estimate marginal effects may inappropriately block causal pathways and may
induce spurious associations between treatment and the outcome, leading to
bias. To avoid such bias, researchers often use marginal structural models
(MSMs) with inverse probability weighting (IPW). However, IPW requires models
for the conditional distributions of treatment and is highly sensitive to their
misspecification. Moreover, IPW is relatively inefficient, susceptible to
finite-sample bias, and difficult to use with continuous treatments. We
introduce an alternative method of constructing weights for MSMs, which we call
""residual balancing."" In contrast to IPW, it requires modeling the conditional
means of the post-treatment confounders rather than the conditional
distributions of treatment, and it is therefore easier to use with continuous
exposures. Numeric simulations suggest that residual balancing is both more
efficient and more robust to model misspecification than IPW and its variants.
We illustrate the method by estimating (a) the cumulative effect of negative
advertising on election outcomes and (b) the controlled direct effect of shared
democracy on public support for war. Open source software is available for
implementing the proposed method.

stars synoptically observed in the Mount Wilson Observatory HK Project.
However, this object is in fact a binary system, raising the question as to
which of the components is responsible for the observed cyclic activity and
what are the properties of that active component. The Hipparcos spacecraft
obtained resolved two-color photometry for this system that indicates that both
components are near the solar temperature. Combined with the precise Gaia
parallax and empirical bolometric corrections we derive component luminosities
of L_A = 5.8 +/- 0.3 Lsun and L_B = 1.025 +/- 0.055 Lsun, and radii R_A = 2.42
+/- 0.08 Rsun and R_B = 1.04 +/- 0.04 Rsun, confirming that the primary
component is a subgiant. We perform an independent estimate of the rotation
period of the A component based on vsini and find that it agrees with the 40.2
d period previously measured from the Ca HK time series. We explore plausible
scenarios for the deconvolved S-index and find that a cycling A component would
have an activity level within the bounds of ensemble activity-rotation trends,
while a cycling B component likely does not. Based on the available rotation
and activity evidence, we find the most likely characterization of the system
is a subgiant primary component responsible for the smooth cyclic behavior in
Ca HK with log(R'_HK) ~ -4.89, while the secondary component has relatively
flat activity at log(R'_HK) ~ -5.02.

explained by theoretical predictions. In order to reconcile this inconsistency,
we investigate evolution of gas giants with a new type II migration formula by
Kanagawa et al. (2018), by comparing the migration, growth timescales of gas
giants, and disk lifetime and by population synthesis simulation. While the
classical migration model assumes that a gas giant opens up a clear gap in the
protoplanetary disk and the planet migration tied to the disk gas accretion,
recent high-resolution simulations show that the migration of gap-opening
planets is decoupled from the disk gas accretion and Kanagawa et al. (2018)
proposed that type II migration speed is no other than type I migration speed
with the reduced disk gas surface density in the gap. We show that with this
new formula, type II migration is significantly reduced for super-jupiter-mass
planets, if the disk accretion is driven by the disk wind as suggested by
recent MHD simulations. Population synthesis simulations show that
super-jupiter-mass planets remain at > 1 au without any additional ingredient
such as disk photoevaporation. Therefore, the mystery of the pile-up of gas
giants at > 1 au would be theoretically solved, if the new formula is confirmed
and wind-driven disk accretion dominates.

peaks near system energy barriers. This implies a minimum-dissipation protocol
that proceeds rapidly when the system is overwhelmingly in a single macrostate,
but slows significantly near energy barriers, thereby harnessing thermal
fluctuations to kick the system over energy barriers with minimal work input.
This model also manifests a phenomenon not seen in otherwise similar

lattice dynamics in 2H-MoTe2 bulk crystals were carried out to understand the
carrier-phonon interactions that govern electronic transport properties. An
unusually long lifetime coherent A1g phonon mode was observed even in the
presence of very large density of photo-excited carriers at room temperature.
The decay rate was observed to decrease with increasing excitation laser
fluence. Based on the laser fluence dependence including the inducement of
significant phonon softening and a peculiar decrease in phonon decay rate, we
attribute the long lifetime lattice dynamics to weak anharmonic phonon-phonon
coupling and a carrier-density-dependent deformation potential electron-phonon
coupling.

detectors available in the scientific and commercial markets. The
photosensitive bandpass is set by material and engineered properties with

traditional infrared materials (like HgCdTe) allowing comparable photometric
sensitivity at higher detector temperatures, easing cooling requirements.
Conversely, at equal cryogenic temperatures the SLS detector will have lower

  with Feedback","Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory in Sept. 2019",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A general time-varying feedback coding scheme is proposed for $M$-user fully
connected symmetric Gaussian interference channels. Based on the analysis of
the general coding scheme, we prove a theorem which gives a criterion for
designing good time-varying feedback codes for Gaussian interference channels.
The proposed scheme improves the Suh-Tse and Kramer inner bounds of the channel
capacity for the cases of weak and not very strong interference when $M=2$.
This capacity improvement is more significant when the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) is not very high. In addition, our coding scheme can be proved
mathematically and numerically to outperform the Kramer code for $M\geq 2$ when
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is equal to Interference to Noise Ratio (INR).
Besides, the generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF) of our proposed coding
scheme can be proved to be optimal in the all network situations (very weak,
weak, strong, very strong) for any $M$. The numerical results show that our
coding scheme can attain better performance than the Suh-Tse coding scheme for
$M=2$ or the Mohajer-Tandon-Poor lattice coding scheme for $M>2$. Furthermore,
the simplicity of the encoding/decoding algorithms is another strong point of
our proposed coding scheme compared with the Suh-Tse coding scheme when $M=2$
and the Mohajer-Tandon-Poor lattice coding scheme when $M>2$. More importantly,
our results show that an optimal coding scheme for the symmetric Gaussian
interference channels with feedback can be achieved by only using marginal
posterior distributions under a better cooperation strategy between
transmitters.

processes for the first time. In particular for exclusive production of vector
mesons, such as the J/$\psi$. In this paper we investigate the underlying
assumptions commonly made when phenomenologically investigating this process
from a shadowing and saturation perspective respectively. We use the bSat model
which is commonly used to describe saturation physics, and a calculation by
M.G. Ryskin which is commonly used when describing nuclear shadowing at leading
twist. It is expected that the bSat model is equivalent to Ryskin's result in
the hard scattering and non-relativistic limits. By explicitly taking these
limits we show that the bSat model does indeed become equivalent to Ryskin's
result. However, two more approximations are needed for this result. Firstly,
the factorisation and renormalisation scales in the bSat model has to be
independent of the dipole radius, and secondly, we need to omit a term in the
overlap between the vector meson and virtual photon wave functions. We show
that for the typical dipole radius of the J/$\psi$, the different
approximations off-set each other and the bSat model agrees very well with
Ryskin's calculation in hard-scattering and non-relativistic limits.

of the mean opinion score (MOS) calibrated by humans in subjective experiments.
However, they cannot predict the satisfied user ratio (SUR) of an aggregated

parameter selection, e.g. the Quantization Parameter (QP) of a set of
consecutive frames, in practical video streaming services. To overcome these
shortcomings, the just-noticeable-difference (JND) based VQA methodology has
been proposed as an alternative. It is observed experimentally that the JND
location is a normally distributed random variable. In this work, we explain
this distribution by proposing a user model that takes both subject
variabilities and content variabilities into account. This model is built upon
user's capability to discern the quality difference between video clips encoded
with different QPs. Moreover, it analyzes video content characteristics to
account for inter-content variability. The proposed user model is validated on
the data collected in the VideoSet. It is demonstrated that the model is

  Theory",,,,,"econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The principle that rational agents should maximize expected utility or
choiceworthiness is intuitively plausible in many ordinary cases of
decision-making under uncertainty. But it is less plausible in cases of
extreme, low-probability risk (like Pascal's Mugging), and intolerably
paradoxical in cases like the St. Petersburg and Pasadena games. In this paper
I show that, under certain conditions, stochastic dominance reasoning can
capture most of the plausible implications of expectational reasoning while
avoiding most of its pitfalls. Specifically, given sufficient background
uncertainty about the choiceworthiness of one's options, many
expectation-maximizing gambles that do not stochastically dominate their
alternatives ""in a vacuum"" become stochastically dominant in virtue of that
background uncertainty. But, even under these conditions, stochastic dominance
will not require agents to accept options whose expectational superiority
depends on sufficiently small probabilities of extreme payoffs. The sort of
background uncertainty on which these results depend looks unavoidable for any
agent who measures the choiceworthiness of her options in part by the total
amount of value in the resulting world. At least for such agents, then,
stochastic dominance offers a plausible general principle of choice under
uncertainty that can explain more of the apparent rational constraints on such
choices than has previously been recognized.

which routes packets based on the destination Public Key (PK). SPB eliminates
the need for TTP by introducing atomic meta-transactions. The two transactions
that form a meta-transaction are visible to the blockchain participants only
after both of them are generated. Thus, if one of the participants does not
commit to its tasks in a pre-defined time, then the energy trade expires and
the corresponding transaction is treated as invalid. The smart meter of the
consumer confirms receipt of energy by generating an Energy Receipt

meter, SPB supports authentication of anonymous smart meters which in turn
enhances the privacy of the meter owner. Qualitative security analysis shows
the resilience of SPB against a range of attacks.

statistical physics. As a network of binary variables with the probability of
becoming 'active' depending only on direct neighbours, the Ising model appears
appropriate for many other processes. For instance, it was recently applied in
psychology to model co-occurrences of mental disorders. It has been shown that
the connections between the variables (nodes) in the Ising network can be
estimated with a series of logistic regressions. This naturally leads to
questions of how well such a model predicts new observations and how well
parameters of the Ising model can be estimated using logistic regressions. Here
we focus on the high-dimensional setting with more parameters than observations
and consider violations of assumptions of the lasso. In particular, we
determine the consequences for both prediction and estimation when the sparsity
and restricted eigenvalue assumptions are not satisfied. We explain by using
the idea of connected copies (extreme multicollinearity) the fact that
prediction becomes better when either sparsity or multicollinearity is not

exploiting the sparsity embedded in the user signals, we can recover the user

pilot signals for channel estimation and/or active user identification. To this

associated quasars at z ~ 2.24 (r ~ 19-20, separation of 3.6 arcsec). Although
this system might be a binary quasar, there is evidence of a collision or

projected pairs of active galactic nuclei: SDSS J1642+3200 (separation of ~ 3
arcsec) comprises a distant quasar (r ~ 18) at z = 2.263 and the active nucleus

these two systems, the background quasar only suffers a weak gravitational
lensing effect by the host galaxy of the foreground active nucleus, so the host
galaxy mass is constrained to be less than (2.9-3) x 10^{11} solar masses

second-order topological insulators based on first-principles calculations,
while topological hinge states have been shown to emerge based on the
associated tight-binding model. The model is equivalent to the one constructed
from a loop-nodal semimetal by adding mass terms and spin-orbit interactions.
We propose to study a chiral-symmetric model obtained from the original
Hamiltonian by simplifying it but keeping almost identical band structures and
topological hinge states. A merit is that we are able to derive various
analytic formulas because of chiral symmetry, which enables us to reveal basic
topological properties of transition metal dichalcogenides. We find a linked
loop structure where a higher linking number (even 8) is realized. We construct
second-order topological semimetals and two-dimensional second-order
topological insulators based on this model. It is interesting that topological
phase transitions occur without gap closing between a topological insulator, a
topological crystalline insulator and a second-order topological insulator. We
propose to characterize them by symmetry detectors discriminating whether the
symmetry is preserved or not. They differentiate topological phases although
the symmetry indicators yield identical values to them. We also show that
topological hinge states are controllable by the direction of magnetization.
When the magnetization points the $z$ direction, the hinges states shift, while
they are gapped when it points the in-plane direction. Accordingly, the
quantized conductance is switched by controlling the magnetization direction.
Our results will be a basis of future topological devices based on transition
metal dichalcogenides.

prediction. Due to the hardness of predicting the flow for a single station,
recent research works often predict the bike flow at cluster-level. While such
studies gain satisfactory prediction accuracy, they cannot directly guide some
fine-grained bike sharing system management issues at station-level. In this
paper, we revisit the problem of the station-level bike flow prediction, aiming
to boost the prediction accuracy leveraging the breakthroughs of deep learning
techniques. We propose a new multi-graph convolutional neural network model to
predict the bike flow at station-level, where the key novelty is viewing the
bike sharing system from the graph perspective. More specifically, we construct
multiple inter-station graphs for a bike sharing system. In each graph, nodes
are stations, and edges are a certain type of relations between stations. Then,
multiple graphs are constructed to reflect heterogeneous relationships (e.g.,
distance, ride record correlation). Afterward, we fuse the multiple graphs and
then apply the convolutional layers on the fused graph to predict station-level
future bike flow. In addition to the estimated bike flow value, our model also
gives the prediction confidence interval so as to help the bike sharing system
managers make decisions. Using New York City and Chicago bike sharing data for

Inferring what causes the motion of a group of objects can even be a
challenging task for experts, e.g., in forensics science. Most of the work in
the literature relies on physics simulation to draw such infer- ences. The
simulation requires a precise model of the under- lying domain to work well and
is essentially a black-box from which one can hardly obtain any useful
explanation. By contrast, qualitative reasoning methods have the advan- tage in
making transparent inferences with ambiguous infor- mation, which makes it
suitable for this task. However, there has been no suitable qualitative theory
proposed for object motion in three-dimensional space. In this paper, we take
this challenge and develop a qualitative theory for the motion of rigid
objects. Based on this theory, we develop a reasoning method to solve a very
interesting problem: Assuming there are several objects that were initially at

ineffective due to lack of training data, on a significantly increased amount
of CS speech and monolingual Dutch speech. Moreover, we improve the language
model (LM) by creating code-switching text, which is in practice almost
non-existent, by (1) generating text using recurrent LMs trained on the
transcriptions of the training CS speech data, (2) adding the transcriptions of
the automatically transcribed CS speech data and (3) translating Dutch text

significantly improved CS ASR performance due to the increase in the acoustic

cross-section. Besides numerous applications where this generic configuration
is found, its main fundamental interest resides in the co-existence of a
recirculation bubble in the outlet and a pair of Dean vortices driven from
within the turning part of the bend, and how their interaction may drive the
flow dynamics. A critical point analysis first shows that the complex flow
topology that results from this particular configuration can be reduced to
three pairs of critical points in the symmetry plane of the bend (with a focus
and a half-saddle each). These pairs respectively generate the first
recirculation bubble, the pair of Dean vortex tubes and a third pair of vortex
tubes located in the upper corner of the bend, akin to the Dean vortices but of
much lower intensity and impact on the rest of the flow. The Dean flow by
contrast drives a strong vertical jet that splits the recirculation bubble into
two symmetric lobes. Unsteadiness sets in at $Re\lesssim800$ through a
supercritical bifurcation, as these lobes start oscillating antisymmetrically.
These initially periodic oscillations grow in amplitude until the lobes break
away from the main recirculation. The system then settles into a second
periodic state where streamwise vortices driven by the Dean flow are
alternatively formed and shed on the left and right part of the outlet. This
novel mechanism of periodic vortex shedding results from the subtle interaction
between the recirculation bubble in the outlet and the pair of Dean vortices
generated in the turning part, and in this sense, they are expected to be a
unique feature of the 180$^o$ bend with sufficiently close side walls.

injective mappings $\varphi: \{0,1\}^m \to {\cal B}(n,w)$ with the following
domination property: every position $j \in [n]$ is dominated by some position
$i \in [m]$, in the sense that ""switching off"" position $i$ in $x \in
\{0,1\}^m$ necessarily switches off position $j$ in its image $\varphi(x)$.
This property may be described more precisely in terms of a bipartite
\emph{domination graph} $G = ([m] \cup [n], E)$ with no isolated vertices, for
all $(i,j) \in E$ and all $x \in \{0,1\}^m$, we require that $x_i = 0$ implies
$y_j = 0$, where $y = \varphi(x)$. Although such domination mappings recently
found applications in the context of coding for high-performance interconnects,
to the best of our knowledge, they were not previously studied.
  In this paper, we begin with simple necessary conditions for the existence of
an $(m,n,w)$-domination mapping $\varphi: \{0,1\}^m \to {\cal B}(n,w)$. We then
provide several explicit constructions of such mappings, which show that the
necessary conditions are also sufficient when $w=1$, when $w=2$ and $m$ is odd,
or when $m \le 3w$. One of our main results herein is a proof that the trivial
necessary condition $|{\cal B}(n,w)| \ge 2^m$ for the existence of an injection
is, in fact, sufficient for the existence of an $(m,n,w)$-domination mapping
whenever $m$ is sufficiently large. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm
that, given any $m$, $n$, and $w$, determines whether an $(m,n,w)$-domination
mapping exists for a domination graph with an equitable degree distribution.

computer vision problems, in order to yield good results they often require
time-consuming architecture search. To combat the complexity of design choices,
prior work has adopted the principle of modularized design which consists in
defining the network in terms of a composition of topologically identical or
similar building blocks (a.k.a. modules). This reduces architecture search to
the problem of determining the number of modules to compose and how to connect
such modules. Again, for reasons of design complexity and training cost,
previous approaches have relied on simple rules of connectivity, e.g.,
connecting each module to only the immediately preceding module or perhaps to
all of the previous ones. Such simple connectivity rules are unlikely to yield
the optimal architecture for the given problem.
  In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to
learn the connections between modules in the network. Instead of being chosen a
priori by the human designer, the connectivity is learned simultaneously with
the weights of the network by optimizing the loss function of the end task
using a modified version of gradient descent. We demonstrate our connectivity
learning method on the problem of multi-class image classification using two
popular architectures: ResNet and ResNeXt. Experiments on four different
datasets show that connectivity learning using our approach yields consistently
higher accuracy compared to relying on traditional predefined rules of
connectivity. Furthermore, in certain settings it leads to significant savings
in number of parameters.

but observational data show that $n \neq 3$, indicating a limitation of the
model. In this work we present a new approach to study the frequency decay of
the rotation of a pulsar, based on an adaptation of the canonical one. We
consider the pulsar a star that rotates in vacuum and has a strong magnetic
field but, differently from the canonical model, we assume that its moment of
inertia changes in time due to a uniform variation of a displacement parameter
in time. We found that the braking index results smaller than the canonical
value as a consequence of an increase in the star's displacement parameter,
whose variation is small enough to allow plausible physical considerations that
can be applied to a more complex model for pulsars in the future. In
particular, this variation is of the order of neutron vortices' creep in
rotating superfluids. When applied to pulsar data our model yielded values for
the stars' braking indices close to the observational ones. The application of
this approach to a more complex star model, where pulsars are assumed to have
superfluid interiors, is the next step in probing it. We hypothesize that the
slow expansion of the displacement parameter might mimic the motion of core
superfluid neutron vortices in realistic models.

picking sequences) is a natural way to allocate the objects. The idea is as
follows: at each stage, a designated agent picks one object among those that
remain. Another intuitive way to obtain an allocation is to give objects to
agents in the first place, and to let agents exchange them as long as such
""deals"" are beneficial. This paper investigates these notions, when agents have
additive preferences over objects, and unveils surprising connections between
them, and with other efficiency and fairness notions. In particular, we show
that an allocation is sequenceable iff it is optimal for a certain type of
deals, namely cycle deals involving a single object. Furthermore, any
Pareto-optimal allocation is sequenceable, but not the converse. Regarding
fairness, we show that an allocation can be envy-free and non-sequenceable, but

complete the picture, we show how some domain restrictions may affect the

intelligent energy networks. It has been well recognized that periodicity is
one of the important characteristics of heat demand. Seasonal-trend
decomposition based on LOESS (STL) algorithm can analyze the periodicity of a
heat demand series, and decompose the series into seasonal and trend
components. Then, predicting the seasonal and trend components respectively,
and combining their predictions together as the heat demand prediction is a
possible way to predict heat demand. In this paper, STL-ENN-ARIMA (SEA), a
combined model, was proposed based on the combination of the Elman neural
network (ENN) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model,
which are commonly applied to heat demand prediction. ENN and ARIMA are used to
predict seasonal and trend components, respectively. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed SEA model has a promising performance.

Frisian, is under-resourced. Recently, we have explored how the acoustic
modeling (AM) can benefit from monolingual speech data belonging to the
high-resourced mixed language. For this purpose, we have trained
state-of-the-art AMs on a significantly increased amount of CS speech by
applying automatic transcription and monolingual Dutch speech. Moreover, we
have improved the language model (LM) by creating CS text in various ways
including text generation using recurrent LMs trained on existing CS text.
Motivated by the significantly improved CS ASR performance, we delve into the
CS detection performance of the same ASR system in this work by reporting CS
detection accuracies together with a detailed detection error analysis.

related to the magnitude of internal heat in rocky planets. A critical value of
internal heat may require in these planets to sustain volcanic activity and the
decline of volcanic activity since their formation of these planets is inferred
to be governed by radioactive decay laws. We find that major volcanic activity
in Mars, Moon, Mercury and Venus has ceased when their respective surface heat
flux values are within ten percentage of the current surface heat flux value of
Earth. The reduction in spatial extent of recent volcanic activity in Venus
compared to the geological past is inferred to be part of significant reduction
in volcanic activity in this twin planet of Earth. We suggest that the volcanic
activity in Earth is also declining significantly since the period of mass
extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago. It may cease completely within a
time span between 19 to 65 million years from now with possible implications in
Earth's interior, climate and biosphere.

topography because the reconstructed phase image can visualize the nanometer
unevenness in a sample. However, the axial range of this method is limited to
the range of the optical wavelength due to the phase wrapping ambiguity.
Although the use of two different wavelengths of light and the resulting
synthetic wavelength, i.e., synthetic wavelength DH, can expand the axial range
up to a few tens of microns, this method is still insufficient for practical
applications. In this article, a tunable external cavity laser diode
phase-locked to an optical frequency comb, namely, an optical-comb-referenced
frequency synthesizer, is effectively used for multiple synthetic wavelengths
within the range of 32 um to 1.20 m. A multiple cascade link of the phase
images among an optical wavelength (= 1.520 um) and 5 different synthetic
wavelengths (= 32.39 um, 99.98 um, 400.0 um, 1003 um, and 4021 um) enables the
shape measurement of a reflective millimeter-sized stepped surface with the
axial resolution of 34 nm. The axial dynamic range, defined as the ratio of the
maximum axial range (= 0.60 m) to the axial resolution (= 34 nm), achieves
1.7*10^8, which is much larger than that of previous synthetic wavelength DH.
Such a wide axial dynamic range capability will further expand the application
field of DH for large objects with meter dimensions.
