space of feasible solutions (e.g. all proper ($\Delta+1$)-list-colorings of the

solution using local information.
  We study distributed sampling and counting problems, in which each instance
specifies a joint distribution of feasible solutions. The task of distributed
algorithm is to sample from this joint distribution, or to locally measure the
volume of the probability space via the marginal probabilities. The latter task
is also known as inference, which is a local counterpart of counting.
  For self-reducible classes of instances, the following equivalences are
established in the LOCAL model up to polylogarithmic factors:
  $\bullet$ For all joint distributions, approximate inference and approximate
sampling are computationally equivalent.
  $\bullet$ For all joint distributions defined by local constraints, exact
sampling is reducible to either one of the above tasks.
  $\bullet$ If further, sequentially constructing a feasible solution is
trivial locally, then all above tasks are easy if and only if the joint
distribution exhibits strong spatial mixing.
  Combining with the state of the arts of strong spatial mixing, we obtain
efficient sampling algorithms in the LOCAL model for various important sampling
problems, including: an $O(\sqrt{\Delta}\log^3n)$-round algorithm for exact
sampling matchings in graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, and an
$O(\log^3n)$-round algorithm for sampling according to the hardcore model

security challenges. For example, software attackers perform code injection and
code-reuse attacks on their remote interfaces, and physical access to IoT
devices allows to tamper with code in memory, steal confidential Intellectual
Property (IP), or mount fault attacks to manipulate a CPU's control flow.
  In this work, we present Sponge-based Control Flow Protection (SCFP). SCFP is
a stateful, sponge-based scheme to ensure the confidentiality of software IP
and its authentic execution on IoT devices. At compile time, SCFP encrypts and
authenticates software with instruction-level granularity. During execution, an
SCFP hardware extension between the CPU's fetch and decode stage continuously
decrypts and authenticates instructions. Sponge-based authenticated encryption
in SCFP yields fine-grained control-flow integrity and thus prevents
code-reuse, code-injection, and fault attacks on the code and the control flow.
In addition, SCFP withstands any modification of software in memory. For
evaluation, we extended a RISC-V core with SCFP and fabricated a real System on
Chip (SoC). The average overhead in code size and execution time of SCFP on
this design is 19.8% and 9.1%, respectively, and thus meets the requirements of
embedded IoT devices.

Linear Energy Transfer (LET) remain one of the largest sources of uncertainty
in proton radiotherapy. This work seeks to identify physics-based metrics which
can be applied to reduce this biological uncertainty.
  Materials and Methods: Three different physical metrics - dose, dose $\times$
LET and a complexity-weighted dose (CWD, Dose $\times$ (1+$\kappa LET_D$) )
were compared with in vitro experimental studies of proton RBE and clinical
treatment plans analysed using RBE models. The biological effects of protons in
each system were plotted against these metrics to quantify the degree of
biological uncertainty introduced by RBE variations in each case.
  Results: When the biological effects of protons were plotted against dose
alone, significant biological uncertainty was introduced as the LET-dependence
of RBE was neglected. Plotting biological effects against dose $\times$ LET
significantly over-estimated the impact of LET on cell survival, leading to
similar or greater levels of biological uncertainty. CWD, by contrast,
significantly reduced biological uncertainties in both experiments and clinical
plans. For prostate and medulloblastoma treatment plans, biological
uncertainties were reduced from $\pm$ 5% to less than 1%.
  Conclusions: While not a replacement for full RBE models, physics-based
metrics such as CWD have the potential to significantly reduce the
uncertainties in proton planning which result from variations in RBE. These
metrics may be used to identify regions in normal tissues which may see
unexpectedly high effects due to end-of-range elevations of RBE, or as a tool
in optimisation to deliver uniform biological effects.

essential for predicting nonlinear optical and magnetic properties of

electronic diradical character requires accurate bond-length patterns, in
addition to accurate absolute bond lengths. We therefore introduce structural
diradical character, which we suggest as an additional measure for comparing
first-principles calculations with experimental data. We employ this measure to
identify suitable exchange-correlation functionals for predicting the bond
length patterns and electronic diradical character of a biscobaltocene with the
potential for photoswitchable nonlinear optical activity. Out of four popular
approximate exchange-correlation functionals with different exact-exchange
admixtures (BP86, TPSS, B3LYP, TPSSh), the two hybrid functionals TPSSh and
B3LYP perform best for diradical bond length patterns, with TPSSh being best
for the organometallic validation systems and B3LYP for the organic ones.
Still, none of the functionals is suitable for correctly describing relative
bond lengths across the range of molecules studied, so that none can be
recommended for predictive studies of (potential) diradicals without
reservation.

dynamics of lattice gauge theories, in particular in regimes that are difficult
to compute on classical computers. Future progress towards scalable quantum
simulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the
efficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the
fundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian,
the lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up
to now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice
quantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the
formulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the
previously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly
simplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of
freedom required to simulate dynamical gauge fields. Exploiting the optimal
representation, we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms
trapped in a tilted optical lattice. Using numerical benchmark simulations, we
demonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum simulator may access the Schwinger
mechanism and map out its non-perturbative onset.

performed using several detectors. The differences among them lie on the
shapes, the site sizes, and the material. Coin-shaped solid-state detectors
made of silicon or diamond with thickness varying from 0.3 to 10 microns, as
well as proportional counters with spherical and cylindrical sensitive volumes
filled with tissue-equivalent gas are the microdosimeters used in therapeutic
proton and carbon-ion beams. One goal of microdosimetry in the clinical
environment is providing repeatable specification of the radiation quality of
the radiation field. A methodology should be developed to provide,
independently from the heterogeneous information collected with the different
detectors, a detector-independent specification of the radiation quality.
Historically the specification of the radiation quality is provided either, in
terms of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) or in terms of lineal energy, y. First
this study focuses on identifying the correlation between the distributions of
LET and the lineal energy spectra as well as the correspondence between their
mean values calculated in frequency and in dose. The evaluation is based on the
method of LET analysis described by Kellerer making the adaptation to the
peculiarities of the therapeutic ion-beam where the pristine irradiation is
unidirectional and made of a single type of mono-energetic ions. The second
objective of this study is to interpret the spectrum collected by a slab and
estimate what the spectrum would be if it was collected by a detector different
in shape, material, or size. An example confirms the method starting from the
simulated lineal energy spectrum obtained for carbon ions in a slab detector of
graphite and converting it to the spectruma that would be obtained in the same
radiation field for spherical, cylindrical, and slab detector made of water.

significantly increases mortality. As regulatory actions are becoming
prohibitively expensive, robust evidence to guide the development of targeted
interventions to reduce air pollution exposure is needed. In this paper, we
introduce a novel statistical method that splits the data into two subsamples:
(a) Using the first subsample, we consider a data-driven search for $\textit{de

the population mean; and then (b) using the second subsample, we quantify
evidence of effect modification among the subgroups with nonparametric
randomization-based tests. We also develop a sensitivity analysis method to
assess the robustness of the conclusions to unmeasured confounding bias. Via
simulation studies and theoretical arguments, we demonstrate that since we
discover the subgroups in the first subsample, hypothesis testing on the second

statistical power of the test. We apply our method to the data of 1,612,414

outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are unmeasured confounding
and censoring by death, i.e., the outcome is only observed when subjects
survive. In randomized experiments with noncompliance, instrumental variable
methods can be used to control for the unmeasured confounding without censoring
by death. But when there is censoring by death, the average causal treatment
effect cannot be identified under usual assumptions, but can be studied for a
specific subpopulation by using sensitivity analysis with additional
assumptions. However, in observational studies, evaluation of the local average
treatment effect (LATE) in censoring by death problems with unmeasured
confounding is not well studied. We develop a novel sensitivity analysis method
based on instrumental variable models for studying the LATE. Specifically, we
present the identification results under an additional assumption, and propose
a three-step procedure for the LATE estimation. Also, we propose an improved
two-step procedure by simultaneously estimating the instrument propensity score
(i.e., the probability of instrument given covariates) and the parameters
induced by the assumption. We have shown with simulation studies that the
two-step procedure can be more robust and efficient than the three-step

such QFT make sense on any globally causal space-times. It is proved that on
the flat Minkowski spacetime realistic QFT, including QED, lead to the
scattering operator and interacting fields understood as generalized operators
in the white noise theory of Hida-Obata-Sait\^o with the perturbative series
equal to the Fock expansion of these operators in the sense of the white noise
calculus and make perfect sense in the adiabatic limit as the generalized
operators. But in case of the flat Minkowski space-time the realistic QFT,
including QED, can be applied only to the scattering phenomena with the
many-particle plane wave generalized states as the \emph{in} and \emph{out}
states. Theory is mathematically consistent without any infrared or ultraviolet
infinities. Feynman rules are replaced with other much more effective
recurrence rules for the higher order contributions to the scattering operator.
It is shown that realistic QFT, e.g. QED, are quite singular on the flat
Minkowski spacetime with the interacting fields as generalized operators, which
are quite singular, which after smearing with test function are not equal to
ordinary operators. Bound state problems cannot be treated entirely within QED
on the Minkowski space-time. It is proved that on space-times with compact
Cauchy surfaces and non-zero curvature realistic causal perturbative QFT,
including QED, behave much better. Perturbative series for some realistic QFT
are proved to be convergent on the globally causal space-times with nonzero

recognize different categories of third-person videos efficiently. Our
motivation is to achieve a light model that could be trained with insufficient
training data. With this intuition, the processing of the 3-dimensional video
input is broken to 1D in temporal dimension on top of the 2D in spatial. The
processes related to 2D spatial frames are being done by utilizing pre-trained
networks with no training phase. The only step which involves training is to
classify the 1D time series resulted from the description of the 2D signals. As
a matter of fact, optical flow images are first calculated from consecutive
frames and described by pre-trained CNN networks. Their dimension is then
reduced using PCA. By stacking the description vectors beside each other, a
multi-channel time series is created for each video. Each channel of the time
series represents a specific feature and follows it over time. The main focus
of the proposed method is to classify the obtained time series effectively.
Towards this, the idea is to let the machine learn temporal features. This is
done by training a multi-channel one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network
(1D-CNN). The 1D-CNN learns the features along the only temporal dimension.
Hence, the number of training parameters decreases significantly which would
result in the trainability of the method on even smaller datasets. It is
illustrated that the proposed method could reach the state-of-the-art results

after the explosion, at an absolute magnitude of -16.82 $\pm$ 0.18 mag. At
$\sim$ 75 days after the explosion, its spectrum transitions from that of a SN

root flipping and state degeneracies, it is more economical when computing
large manifolds of states, and it simplifies evaluation of transition-specific

intensive research interests due to their elegant theoretical foundation and
excellent empirical performance as generative models. These tools provide a
promising direction in the studies where data availability is limited. One
common issue in GANs is that the density of the learned generative distribution
could concentrate on the training data points, meaning that they can easily
remember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks.
This becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to private or sensitive data
such as patient medical records, and the concentration of distribution may
divulge critical patient information. To address this issue, in this paper we
propose a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model, in which we achieve
differential privacy in GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradients
during the learning procedure. We provide rigorous proof for the privacy
guarantee, as well as comprehensive empirical evidence to support our analysis,
where we demonstrate that our method can generate high quality data points at a

  We introduce the notion of distributed recoloring: The input graph represents
a network of computers that needs to be recolored. Initially, each node is
aware of its own input color and target color. The nodes can exchange messages
with each other, and eventually each node has to stop and output its own

recoloring schedules have to be globally consistent so that the graph remains
properly colored at each point, and we require that adjacent nodes do not
change their colors simultaneously.
  We are interested in the following questions: How many communication rounds
are needed (in the LOCAL model of distributed computing) to find a recoloring
schedule? What is the length of the recoloring schedule? And how does the
picture change if we can use extra colors to make recoloring easier?

of Langer's theory in the intermediate-to-high damping (IHD) regime. For a
N\'eel skyrmion, a Bloch skyrmion, and an antiskyrmion, we look at two possible
paths to annihilation: collapse and escape through a boundary. We also study
the effects of a curved vs. a flat boundary, a second skyrmion and a
non-magnetic defect. We find that the skyrmion's internal modes play a dominant
role in the thermally activated transitions compared to the spin-wave
excitations and that the relative contribution of internal modes depends on the
nature of the transition process. Our calculations for a small skyrmion
stabilized at zero-field show that collapse on a defect is the most probable
path. In the absence of a defect, the annihilation is largely dominated by
escape mechanisms, even though in this case the activation energy is higher
than that of collapse processes. Escape through a flat boundary is found more
probable than through a curved boundary. The potential source of stability of
metastable skyrmions is therefore found not to lie in high activation energies,
nor in the dynamics at the transition state, but comes from entropic narrowing
in the saddle point region which leads to lowered attempt frequencies. This
narrowing effect is found to be primarily associated with the skyrmion's
internal modes.

this cooperation supporting mechanism offers lonely defectors a high surviving

  Strongly Sublinear Memory",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, studying fundamental graph problems in the \emph{Massively Parallel
Computation (MPC) framework, inspired by the MapReduce paradigm, has gained a
lot of attention. An assumption common to a vast majority of approaches is to
allow $\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ memory per machine, where $n$ is the number of
nodes in the graph and $\widetilde{\Omega}$ hides polylogarithmic factors.
However, as pointed out by Karloff et al. [SODA'10] and Czumaj et al.
[STOC'18], it might be unrealistic for a single machine to have linear or only
slightly sublinear memory.
  In this paper, we thus study a more practical variant of the MPC model which
only requires substantially sublinear or even subpolynomial memory per machine.
In contrast to the linear-memory MPC model and also to streaming algorithms, in
this low-memory MPC setting, a single machine will only see a small number of
nodes in the graph. We introduce a new and strikingly simple technique to cope
with this imposed locality.
  In particular, we show that the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem can be
solved efficiently, that is, in $O(\log^3 \log n)$ rounds, when the input graph
is a tree. This constitutes an almost exponential speed-up over the low-memory
MPC algorithm in $O(\sqrt{\log n})$-algorithm in a concurrent work by Ghaffari
and Uitto [SODA'19] and substantially reduces the local memory from
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ required by the recent $O(\log \log n)$-round MIS
algorithm of Ghaffari et al. [PODC'18] to $n^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha>0$,
without incurring a significant loss in the round complexity. Moreover, it
demonstrates how to make use of the all-to-all communication in the MPC model
to almost exponentially improve on the corresponding bound in the
$\mathsf{LOCAL}$ and $\mathsf{PRAM}$ models by Lenzen and Wattenhofer
[PODC'11].

given, but the response for each point is hidden unless explicitly requested.
The goal is to sample only a small number $k \ll n$ of the responses, and then
produce a weight vector whose sum of squares loss over all points is at most
$1+\epsilon$ times the minimum. When $k$ is very small (e.g., $k=d$), jointly
sampling diverse subsets of points is crucial. One such method called volume
sampling has a unique and desirable property that the weight vector it produces
is an unbiased estimate of the optimum. It is therefore natural to ask if this
method offers the optimal unbiased estimate in terms of the number of responses
$k$ needed to achieve a $1+\epsilon$ loss approximation.
  Surprisingly we show that volume sampling can have poor behavior when we
require a very accurate approximation -- indeed worse than some i.i.d. sampling
techniques whose estimates are biased, such as leverage score sampling. We then
develop a new rescaled variant of volume sampling that produces an unbiased
estimate which avoids this bad behavior and has at least as good a tail bound
as leverage score sampling: sample size $k=O(d\log d + d/\epsilon)$ suffices to
guarantee total loss at most $1+\epsilon$ times the minimum with high
probability. Thus, we improve on the best previously known sample size for an
unbiased estimator, $k=O(d^2/\epsilon)$.
  Our rescaling procedure leads to a new efficient algorithm for volume
sampling which is based on a determinantal rejection sampling technique with
potentially broader applications to determinantal point processes. Other
contributions include introducing the combinatorics needed for rescaled volume
sampling and developing tail bounds for sums of dependent random matrices which
arise in the process.

problem due to several reasons: 1) it is a nonconvex fractional programming
problem, 2) the transmission rate functions are characterized by

power consumption may depend on the transmission rate. We tackle this problem
by the successive pseudoconvex approximation approach, and we argue that
pseudoconvex optimization plays a fundamental role in designing novel iterative
algorithms, not only because every locally optimal point of a pseudoconvex
optimization problem is also globally optimal, but also because a descent
direction is easily obtained from every optimal point of a pseudoconvex
optimization problem. The proposed algorithms have the following advantages: 1)
fast convergence as the structure of the original optimization problem is
preserved as much as possible in the approximate problem solved in each
iteration, 2) easy implementation as each approximate problem is suitable for
parallel computation and its solution has a closed-form expression, and 3)
guaranteed convergence to a stationary point or a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. The
advantages of the proposed algorithm are also illustrated numerically.

unstable mass transfer. Although stable mass transfer predicts the formation of
ELM WDs with thick hydrogen (H) envelopes, and hence characterized by dominant
residual nuclear burning along the cooling branch, the formation of ELM WDs
with thinner H envelopes from unstable mass loss cannot be discarded. We
compute new evolutionary sequences for helium (He) core WD stars with thin H
envelope with the main aim of assessing the lowest $T_{\rm eff}$ that could be
reached by this type of stars. We generate a new grid of evolutionary sequences
of He core WD stars with thin H envelope in the mass range from $0.1554$ to
$0.2025 M_{\odot}$, and assess the changes in both the cooling times and
surface gravity induced by a reduction of the H envelope. We also determine,
taking into account the predictions of progenitor evolution, the lowest $T_{\rm
eff}$ reached by the resulting ELM WDs. We find that a slight reduction in the
H envelope yields a significant increase in the cooling rate of ELM WDs.
Because of this, ELM WDs with thin H envelope could cool down to $\sim 2500\
$K, in contrast with their canonical counterparts that cool down to $\sim 7000\
$K. In addition, we find that a reduction of the thickness of the H envelope
increases markedly the surface gravity ($g$) of these stars. If ELM WDs are
formed with thin H envelopes, they could be detected at very low $T_{\rm eff}$.
The detection of such cool ELM WDs would be indicative that they were formed
with thin H envelopes, thus opening the possibility of placing constraints to
the possible mechanisms of formation of this type of stars. Last but not least,
the increase in $g$ due to the reduction of the H envelope leads to
consequences in the spectroscopic determinations of these stars.

thermodynamics. Such an ""anomalous"" heat current was observed in a recent
experiment (arXiv:1711.03323), by employing two spin systems initially quantum
correlated. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between this intriguing

energy transfer between two microscopic systems, for arbitrary initial
bipartite states. Using these theorems, we obtain an analytical bound showing
that certain type of quantum coherence can optimize such a process,
outperforming incoherent states. This genuine quantum advantage is corroborated
through a characterization of the energy transfer between two qubits. For this
system, it is shown that a large enough amount of coherence is necessary and
sufficient to revert the thermodynamic arrow of time. As a second crucial
consequence of the presented theorems, we introduce a class of nonequilibrium

squeezed-limit bispectrum and collapsed trispectrum of matter and halos. We
describe these statistics in terms of long-wavelength $2$-point functions
involving the matter/halo density and position-dependent power spectrum. This
allows us to derive simple, analytic expression for the information content,
treating constraints from scale-dependent bias in the halo power spectrum on
the same footing as those from higher order statistics. In particular, we
include non-Gaussian covariance due to long-short mode-coupling from non-linear
evolution, which manifests itself as long-mode cosmic variance in the
position-dependent power spectrum. We find that bispectrum forecasts that
ignore this cosmic variance may underestimate $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})$ by up to a
factor $\sim 3$ for the matter density (at $z=1$) and commonly a factor $\sim
2$ for the halo bispectrum. Constraints from the bispectrum can be improved by
combining it with the power spectrum and trispectrum. The reason is that, in
the position-dependent power spectrum picture, the bispectrum and trispectrum
intrinsically incorporate multitracer cosmic variance cancellation, which is
optimized in a joint analysis. For halo statistics, we discuss the roles of
scale-dependent bias, matter mode-coupling, and non-linear, non-Gaussian
biasing ($b_{11}^{(h)}$). While scale-dependent bias in the halo power spectrum
is already very constraining, higher order halo statistics are competitive in
the regime where stochastic noise in the position-dependent halo power spectrum
is low enough for cosmic variance cancellation to be effective, i.e.~for large
halo number density and large $k_{\rm max}$. This motivates exploring this
regime observationally.

exists for stellar $\alpha$-enhancement, implying that present-day specific
SFRs are correlated with long time-scale star formation histories. Between
$z=0$ and 1, the $\alpha$-enhancement plane is even more insensitive to
redshift than the plane using metallicity. However, it evolves at $z>1$ due to
lagging iron yields. At fixed mass, galaxies with higher SFRs have star
formation histories shifted toward late times, are more $\alpha$-enhanced and
this $\alpha$-enhancement increases with redshift as observed. These findings
suggest that relations between physical properties inferred from observations

discontinuity in X-ray observations. To search for diffuse radio emission

independent sets of stellar isochrones, PARSEC-COLIBRI and MIST, to assess the
uncertainties related to stellar evolution modelling. Irrespective of the
adopted stellar models, all the three dwarfs are found to have had almost
constant star formation rates (SFRs) in the last 100-200 Myr, with modest
enhancements (a factor of $\sim$2) above the 100 Myr-averaged-SFR. Significant
differences among the three dwarfs are found in the overall SFR, the timing of
the most recent peak and the SFR$/$area. The Initial Mass Function (IMF) of
NGC1705 and Holmberg II is consistent with a Salpeter slope down to $\approx$ 5
M$_{\odot}$, whereas it is slightly flatter, s$=-2.0$, in NGC4449. The SFHs
derived with the two different sets of stellar models are consistent with each
other, except for some quantitative details, attributable to their input
assumptions. They also share the drawback that all synthetic diagrams predict a
clear separation in color between upper main sequence and helium burning stars,
which is not apparent in the data. Since differential reddening, significant in
NGC4449, or unresolved binaries don't appear to be sufficient to fill the gap,
we suggest this calls for a revision of both sets of stellar evolutionary

invokes a time-dependent metal outflow loading factor with stronger outflows at
early times. The other scenario uses a time-dependent IMF slope with a steeper
IMF at early times. In this work, we extend our study to investigate the radial
profile of gas and stellar metallicity in local star-forming galaxies using
spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We find
that most galaxies show negative gradients in both gas and stellar metallicity
with steeper gradients in stellar metallicity. The stellar metallicity gradient
tend to be mass dependent with steeper gradients in more massive galaxies while
no clear mass dependence is found for the gas metallicity gradient. Then we
compare the observations with the predictions from a chemical evolution model
of the radial profiles of gas and stellar metallicities. We confirm that the
two scenarios proposed in our previous work are also required to explain the
metallicity gradients. Based on these two scenarios we successfully reproduce
the radial profiles of gas metallicity, stellar metallicity, stellar mass
surface density, and star formation rate (SFR) surface density simultaneously.
The origin of the negative gradient in stellar metallicity turns out to be
driven by either radially dependent metal outflow or IMF slope. In contrast,
the radial dependence of the gas metallicity is less constrained because of the
degeneracy in model parameters.

Jupiter (Jupiter analogues) are unknown. Using spectroscopic metallicities, we
show that stars hosting Jupiter analogues have an average metallicity close to
solar, in contrast to their hot-Jupiter and eccentric cool Jupiter
counterparts, which orbit stars with super-solar metallicities. Furthermore,
the eccentricities of Jupiter analogues increase with host star metallicity,
suggesting that planet-planet scatterings producing highly eccentric cool
Jupiters could be more common in metal-rich environments. To investigate a
possible explanation for these metallicity trends, we compare the observations
to numerical simulations, which indicate that metal-rich stars typically form
multiple Jupiters, leading to planet-planet interactions and, hence, a
prevalence of either eccentric cool Jupiters or hot-Jupiters with circularized
orbits. Although the samples are small and exhibit variations in their
metallicities, suggesting that numerous processes other than metallicity affect
the formation of planetary systems, the data in hand suggests that Jupiter
analogues and terrestrial-sized planets form around stars with average
metallicities close to solar, whereas high metallicity systems preferentially
host eccentric cool Jupiter or hot-Jupiters, indicating higher metallicity
systems may not be favorable for the formation of planetary systems akin to the

orbits. Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on
these orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three
main categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs. Respective TDEs are
characterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower
critical eccentricity is the one below which the stars on eccentric orbits
cause the finite, intense accretion, and the higher critical eccentricity above
which the stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that
the parabolic TDEs are divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic,
marginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We analytically derive
that the mass fallback rate of the marginally eccentric TDEs can be flatter and
slightly higher than the standard fallback rate proportional to $t^{-5/3}$,

stellar population across a large volume- and mass-selected sample of galaxies
at large lookback time. We measure the 4000\AA\ break (D$_n$4000) and Balmer
absorption line strengths (probed by H$\delta$) from 1019 high-quality spectra
of $z=0.6 - 1.0$ galaxies with $M_\ast = 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot - 3 \times
10^{11} M_\odot$. Our analysis serves as a first illustration of the power of
high-resolution, high-S/N continuum spectroscopy at intermediate redshifts as a
qualitatively new tool to constrain galaxy formation models. The observed
D$_n$4000-EW(H$\delta$) distribution of our sample overlaps with the
distribution traced by present-day galaxies, but $z\sim 0.8$ galaxies populate
that locus in a fundamentally different manner. While old galaxies dominate the
present-day population at all stellar masses $> 2\times10^{10} M_\odot$, we see
a bimodal D$_n$4000-EW(H$\delta$) distribution at $z\sim0.8$, implying a
bimodal light-weighted age distribution. The light-weighted age depends
strongly on stellar mass, with the most massive galaxies
$>1\times10^{11}M_\odot$ being almost all older than 2 Gyr. At the same time we
estimate that galaxies in this high mass range are only $\sim3$ Gyr younger
than their $z\sim0.1$ counterparts, at odd with pure passive evolution given a
difference in lookback time of $>5$ Gyr; younger galaxies must grow to
$>10^{11}M_\odot$ in the meantime, and/or small amounts of young stars must
keep the light-weighted ages young. Star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0.8$ have
stronger H$\delta$ absorption than present-day galaxies with the same
D$_n$4000, implying larger short-term variations in star-formation activity.

black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN), yet this technique is not
universally accepted. Indeed, complex reprocessing (absorption, scattering) of
the intrinsic spectra along the line of sight can mimic the relativistic
effects on which the spin measure is based. In this work, we test the
reliability of SMBH spin measurements that can currently be achieved through
the simulations of high-quality XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra. Each member of
our group simulated ten spectra with multiple components that are typically
seen in AGN, such as warm and (partial-covering) neutral absorbers,
relativistic and distant reflection, and thermal emission. The resulting
spectra were blindly analysed by the other two members. Out of the 60 fits, 42
turn out to be physically accurate when compared to the input model. The SMBH
spin is retrieved with success in 31 cases, some of which (9) are even found
among formally inaccurate fits (although with looser constraints). We show
that, at the high signal-to-noise ratio assumed in our simulations, neither the
complexity of the multi-layer, partial-covering absorber nor the input value of
the spin are the major drivers of our results. The height of the X-ray source
(in a lamp-post geometry) instead plays a crucial role in recovering the spin.
In particular, a success rate of 16 out of 16 is found among the accurate fits
for a dimensionless spin parameter larger than 0.8 and a lamp-post height lower
than five gravitational radii.

significantly complicate the construction of a galaxy UV luminosity function at

provide the most stringent bounds on supersymmetric effects and will continue
to do so in the future. Radiative $\ell\to\ell^\prime\gamma$ decays and
leptonic three-body decays $\ell\to 3\ell^\prime$ show an interesting

of $0.8^\circ$. Despite the uncertainty in the retrieved albedo map, we
robustly identify a high albedo region (the Sahara desert) and a large

vanishing of the bulk cosmological constant appears as the zero velocity of
light limit. This sets how Carrollian geometry emerges in flat holography. The
new boundary data are a two-dimensional spatial surface, identified with the
null infinity of the bulk Ricci-flat spacetime, accompanied with a Carrollian

of a conformal Carrollian fluid. These are the energy, the viscous stress

conducted with a flat derivative expansion, resummed in a closed form in

we identify 4 member stars, from which we calculate a systemic velocity of

systemic velocities, $\sim200$ km/s, indicates that they are unlikely to be a
bound pair. One or both systems are likely associated with the Large Magellanic

since $z\sim1$ up to the present time. Combining the ALHAMBRA multi-filter
photo-spectra with the SED-fitting code MUFFIT, we build a complete catalogue
of quiescent galaxies via the dust-corrected stellar mass vs colour diagram.
This catalogue includes stellar population properties, such as age,
metallicity, extinction, stellar mass and photometric redshift, retrieved from
the analysis of composited populations based on two independent sets of SSP
models. We develop and apply a novel methodology to provide, for the first
time, the analytic probability distribution functions (PDFs) of mass-weighted
age, metallicity, and extinction of quiescent galaxies as a function of
redshift and stellar mass. We adopt different star formation histories to
discard potential systematics in the analysis. The number density of quiescent
galaxies is found to increase since $z\sim1$, with a more substantial variation
at lower mass. Quiescent galaxies feature extinction $A_V<0.6$, with median
values in the range $A_V = 0.15\mathrm{-}0.3$. At increasing stellar mass,
quiescent galaxies are older and more metal rich since $z\sim1$. A detailed
analysis of the PDFs reveals that the evolution of quiescent galaxies is not
compatible with passive evolution and a slight decrease is hinted at median
metallicity $0.1\mathrm{-}0.2$~dex. The intrinsic dispersion of the age and
metallicity PDFs show a dependence with stellar mass and/or redshift. These
results are consistent with both sets of SSP models and the alternative SFH
assumptions explored. Consequently, the quiescent population must undergo an
evolutive pathway including mergers and/or remnants of star formation to
reconcile the observed trends, where the `progenitor' bias should also be taken
into account.

a search for candidate substructures in the GC population around the Virgo cD
galaxy M87 through the analysis of the spatial distribution of the GC
colors.~The study is based on a sample of $\sim\!1800$ bright GCs with
high-quality $u,g,r,i,z,K_s$ photometry, selected to ensure a low contamination
by foreground stars or background galaxies.~The spectral energy distributions
of the GCs are associated with formal estimates of age and metallicity, which
are representative of its position in a 4-D color-space relative to standard
single stellar population models.~Dividing the sample into broad bins based on
the relative formal ages, we observe inhomogeneities which reveal signatures of
GC substructures.~The most significant of these is a spatial overdensity of GCs
with relatively young age labels, of diameter $\sim\!0.1$\,deg
($\sim\!30\,$kpc), located to the south of M87.~The significance of this
detection is larger than about 5$\sigma$ after accounting for estimates of
random and systematic errors.~Surprisingly, no large Virgo galaxy is present in
this area, that could potentially host these GCs.~But candidate substructures
in the M87 halo with equally elusive hosts have been described based on
kinematic studies in the past.~The number of GC spectra available around M87 is
currently insufficient to clarify the nature of the new candidate substructure.

that many attack strategies aim to perturb image pixels in ways that are

introduced by compression, Shield ""vaccinates"" a model by re-training it with
compressed images, where different compression levels are applied to generate
multiple vaccinated models that are ultimately used together in an ensemble
defense. On top of that, Shield adds an additional layer of protection by
employing randomization at test time that compresses different regions of an

estimate the transformation performed. This novel combination of vaccination,

will show in this scenario that we can achieve lower word error rates by
developing a deep learning based encoder and decoder. While the approach of
separate source and channel coding would minimize bit error rates, our approach
preserves semantic information of sentences by first embedding sentences in a
semantic space where sentences closer in meaning are located closer together,
and then performing joint source and channel coding on these embeddings.

web analytics task. The basic idea is to use the frequencies of queries in web

estimating current ILI activity. It has been noted that since influenza is
seasonal, this approach can lead to spurious correlations with features/queries
that also exhibit seasonality, but have no relationship with ILI. Spurious
correlations can, in turn, degrade performance. To address this issue, we
propose modeling the seasonal variation in ILI activity and selecting queries

parametrised by a curve is the generating series of the classes, in the
Grothendieck ring of varieties, of moduli spaces of sections of this family

zeta function associated to a family of varieties with generic fiber having the
structure of an equivariant compactification of a vector group. Our main
theorem describes the convergence of this motivic height zeta function with
respect to a topology on the Grothendieck ring of varieties coming from the
theory of weights in cohomology. We deduce from it the asymptotic behaviour, as
the degree goes to infinity, of a positive proportion of the coefficients of
the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of the above moduli spaces: in particular, we get
an estimate for their dimension and the number of components of maximal
dimension. The main tools for this are a notion of motivic Euler product for
series with coefficients in the Grothendieck ring of varieties, an extension of
Hrushovski and Kazhdan's motivic Poisson summation formula, and a motivic
measure on the Grothendieck ring of varieties with exponentials constructed

rich signal set that contains the necessary information to pinpoint both the

modalities in how light is guided through our elastomer. This method results in
a low cost, easy to manufacture sensor. We believe this approach can be adapted
to cover non-planar surfaces, simplifying future integration in robot skin
applications.

configurations: laminar Couette flow at $Re=740$ and turbulent channel flow at
$Re_{\tau}=180$, where $\tau$ is the shear stress at the wall. The top wall is
smooth and the bottom wall is a realistically rough superhydrophobic surface
(SHS), generated from a three-dimensional surface profile measurement. The
air-water interface, which is assumed to be flat, is simulated using the
volume-of-fluid (VOF) approach. The laminar Couette flow is studied with
varying interface heights $h$ to understand the effect on slip and drag
reduction ($DR$). The presence of the surface roughness is felt up to $40\%$ of
the channel height in the wall-normal direction. A nonlinear dependence of $DR$
on $h$ is observed with three distinct regions. The DNS results are used to
obtain a nonlinear curve fit for gas fraction $\phi_g$ as a function of $h$,
where $\phi_g$ determines the amount of slip area exposed to the flow. A power
law linear regression fit is used to obtain $b_{eff}$ as a function of
$\phi_g$. For the turbulent channel flow, statistics of the flow field are
compared to that of a smooth wall to understand the effects of roughness and
$h$. Two interface heights, $h=h_{rms}$ and $h=h_{max}$ are simulated to study
their effect on the behaviour of the flow, where $h_{rms}$ and $h_{max}$ are
the rms and maximum peak of the roughness heights respectively. Results show
that the presence of trapped air in the cavities significantly alters near wall
flow physics. The fully wetted roughness increases the peak value in turbulent
intensities, whereas the presence of the interface suppresses them. Overall,
there exists a competing effect between the interface and the asperities, where
the interface suppresses turbulence whereas the asperities enhance them.

by as much as an order of magnitude depending on the computational methods and
assumed properties of the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In this work,
we study the origin of these discrepancies, and seek to determine the correct
momentum budget for a homogeneous ISM. We carry out 3D hydrodynamic (HD) and
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of clustered supernova explosions, using
a Lagrangian method and checking for convergence with respect to resolution. We
find that the terminal momentum of a shell driven by clustered supernovae is
dictated primarily by the mixing rate across the contact discontinuity between
the hot and cold phases, and that this energy mixing rate is dominated by
numerical diffusion even at the highest resolution we can complete, 0.03
$M_\odot$. Magnetic fields also reduce the mixing rate, so that MHD simulations
produce higher momentum yields than HD ones at equal resolution. As a result,
we obtain only a lower limit on the momentum yield from clustered supernovae.
Combining this with our previous 1D results, which provide an upper limit
because they allow almost no mixing across the contact discontinuity, we
conclude that the momentum yield per supernova from clustered supernovae in a
homogeneous ISM is bounded between $2\times 10^5$ and $3\times 10^6$ $M_\odot$
km s$^{-1}$. A converged value for the simple homogeneous ISM remains elusive.

an adapted analysis of a self-organizing process of oscillatory dynamics. This

explain and understand the rate of black hole feeding. The aim of this work is
to investigate the influence of stellar bars in spiral galaxies on the thin

multi-scale simulations simultaneously resolving the galactic disk and the
accretion disk around the central black-hole. We vary in all simulations the
initial gas disk mass. As additional parameter we choose either the gas
temperature for isothermal simulations or the cooling timescale in case of
non-isothermal simulations. Accretion is either driven by a gravitationally
unstable or clumpy accretion disk or by energy dissipation in strong shocks.
Most simulations show a strong dependence of the accretion rate at the outer

well-known 120$^{\circ}$ magnetic ordering, experimental observations have
revealed a strong quantum character of the excitation spectrum. We conjecture
that this phenomenon arises from the proximity of the ground state of the TLHM
to the quantum melting point separating the magnetically ordered and spin
liquid states. Within this scenario, magnons are described as collective modes
(two spinon-bound states) of a spinon condensate (Higgs phase) that
spontaneously breaks the SU(2) symmetry of the TLHM. Crucial to our results is
the proper account of this spontaneous symmetry breaking. The main qualitative
difference relative to semi-classical treatments ($1/S$ expansion) is the
presence of a high-energy spinon continuum extending up to about three times
the single-magnon bandwidth. In addition, the magnitude of the ordered moment
($m=0.224$) agrees very well with numerical results and the low energy part of
the single-magnon dispersion is in very good agreement with series expansions.
Our results indicate that the Schwinger boson approach is an adequate starting
point for describing the excitation spectrum of some magnetically ordered
compounds that are near the quantum melting point separating this Higgs phase
from the {\it deconfined} spin liquid state.

up-scattering from the lower mass state may be kinematically forbidden, at
which point the thermalisation process effectively stops. A larger evaporation
rate is also expected due to down-scattering. In this work, we perform a
numerical simulation of the capture and thermalisation process in order to
study the evolution of the dark matter distribution. We then calculate and
compare the annihilation rate with that of the often assumed Maxwell--Boltzmann

observation records, which are often required for identification. The new
algorithm is particularly suitable for cases where the available sample size is
large enough to accurately estimate second-order output probabilities, but not
higher-order ones. We show that if one is only able to obtain a reliable
estimate of the pairwise co-occurrence probabilities of the emissions, it is
still possible to uniquely identify the HMM if the emission probability is
\emph{sufficiently scattered}. We apply our method to hidden topic Markov
modeling, and demonstrate that we can learn topics with higher quality if
documents are modeled as observations of HMMs sharing the same emission (topic)
probability, compared to the simple but widely used bag-of-words model.

one pixel is added to pixels that are read out one, two and/or three pixels
later. One result of this effect is the introduction of a differential offset
in the background when comparing regions with and without flux from science
targets. Conventional data reduction methods do not correct for this offset. We
find this effect in 16 of 22 instruments investigated, covering a variety of
telescopes and many different front-end electronics systems. The affected
instruments include LRIS and DEIMOS on the Keck telescopes, WFC3-UVIS and STIS
on HST, MegaCam on CFHT, SNIFS on the UH88 telescope, GMOS on the Gemini
telescopes, HSC on Subaru, and FORS on VLT. The amplitude of the introduced
offset is up to 4.5 ADU per pixel, and it is not directly proportional to the
measured ADU level. We have developed a model that can be used to detect this
""binary offset effect"" in data and correct for it. Understanding how data are
affected and applying a correction for the effect is essential for precise
astronomical measurements.

extinctions using both adaptive and fixed resolution techniques, and correlate
these maps with neutral HI and CO gas maps from literature, including The HI
Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and the HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey

dust-to-gas ratio with galaxy metallicity. We find a power law relationship
between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, consistent with other studies of
dust-to-gas ratio compared to metallicity. We find a change in the relation
when H$_2$ is not included. This implies that underestimation of $N_{H_2}$ in
low-metallicity dwarfs from a too-low CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor $X_{CO}$
could have produced too low a slope in the derived relationship between
dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity. We also compare our extinctions to those

collaboration among a team rather than a pair of coauthors, or biological

a state where the net flux through every vertex of the graph is zero. In

Implementation on neuromorphic systems may help to reduce energy demand.
Conventional ANNs must be converted into equivalent Spiking Neural Networks

to perform this translation. We map the ANN weights to SNN synapses
layer-by-layer by forming a least-square-error approximation problem at each

  An optimal set of synapse weights may then be found for a given choice of ANN

simple linear program solver was used. The experiments show that the resulting
networks maintain agreement with the original ANN and excellent performance on
the evaluation tasks. The networks were also reduced in size with little loss

properties that one may leverage to compute efficiently a wide range of hard
problems. In this perspective we discuss how to employ one such property,
memory (time non-locality), in a novel physics-based approach to computation:
Memcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)
that are scalable. DMMs can be realized with non-linear dynamical systems with
memory. The latter property allows the realization of a new type of Boolean
logic, one that is self-organizing. Self-organizing logic gates are
""terminal-agnostic"", namely they do not distinguish between input and output
terminals. When appropriately assembled to represent a given
combinatorial/optimization problem, the corresponding self-organizing circuit
converges to the equilibrium points that express the solutions of the problem
at hand. In doing so, DMMs take advantage of the long-range order that develops
during the transient dynamics. This collective dynamical behavior, reminiscent
of a phase transition, or even the ""edge of chaos"", is mediated by families of
classical trajectories (instantons) that connect critical points of increasing
stability in the system's phase space. The topological character of the
solution search renders DMMs robust against noise and structural disorder.
Since DMMs are non-quantum systems described by ordinary differential
equations, not only can they be built in hardware with available technology,
they can also be simulated efficiently on modern classical computers. As an
example, we will show the polynomial-time solution of the subset-sum problem

Voltage imbalance among series connected thyristors during steady state as well
as in transients is one of the major concerns. This voltage imbalance is
mitigated by using static and dynamic balancing network. Dynamic balancing
networks are typically designed based on reverse recovery charge of the
thyristor during turn-off, which suits many applications. But this is not the
case for a crowbar application, where turn-off of the thyristor is not a major
circuit constraint. This paper proposes the design method for dynamic balancing
network considering gate turn-on delay time and the balancing network component
tolerances. The paper derives two models for the dynamic balancing network
based on its charge-discharge cycle. The importance of charge-discharge cycle
in the design of dynamic balancing network during high di/dt operation is
emphasized. Influence of dynamic balancing resistance and crowbar current
limiting inductance on voltage imbalance, charging current and discharging
current is studied using the analytical model. The proposed design method also
offers flexibility to incorporate differences in propagation delays among the
thyristor drivers that are used to trigger individual thyristors. Such delays
cannot be directly incorporated in the conventional balancing network design
method based on reverse recovery. Further, it is also analytically shown that
designing the dynamic balancing network based on reverse recovery charge makes
the balancing network lossy and bulky for crowbar application. Simulation
studies and experimental results on a 12kV , 1kA crowbar consisting of six
series connected thyristors confirms the theoretical analysis and validates the
proposed approach for crowbar applications.

Components Analysis (PCA) - are widely used for inferring and summarizing
structure in multivariate data. Many matrix factorization methods exist,
corresponding to different assumptions on the elements of the underlying matrix
factors. For example, many recent methods use a penalty or prior distribution
to achieve sparse representations (""Sparse FA/PCA""). Here we introduce a
general Empirical Bayes approach to matrix factorization (EBMF), whose key
feature is that it uses the observed data to estimate prior distributions on
matrix elements. We derive a correspondingly-general variational fitting
algorithm, which reduces fitting EBMF to solving a simpler problem - the
so-called ""normal means"" problem. We implement this general algorithm, but
focus particular attention on the use of sparsity-inducing priors that are
uni-modal at 0. This yields a sparse EBMF approach - essentially a version of
sparse FA/PCA - that automatically adapts the amount of sparsity to the data.
We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through both numerical comparisons
with competing methods and through analysis of data from the GTEx (Genotype
Tissue Expression) project on genetic associations across 44 human tissues. In
numerical comparisons EBMF often provides more accurate inferences than other
methods. In the GTEx data, EBMF identifies interpretable structure that

that adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and hybrid automatic repeat request

conventional combination of HARQ with AMC is counterproductive from the
throughput point of view, we adopt the so-called layer-coded HARQ (L-HARQ).
L-HARQ allows consecutive packets to share the channel and preserves a great
degree of separation between AMC and HARQ; this makes the encoding and decoding
very simple and allows us to use the available/optimized codes. Numerical
examples shown in the paper indicate that L-HARQ can provide significant
throughput gains compared to the conventional HARQ. The L-HARQ is also
implemented using turbo codes indicating that the throughput gains also

hidden message and the cover medium need to be recovered without loss. Among
many RDH approaches is prediction-error expansion (PEE), containing two steps:
i) prediction of a target pixel value, and ii) embedding according to the value
of prediction-error. In general, higher prediction performance leads to larger
embedding capacity and/or lower signal distortion. Leveraging on recent
advances in graph signal processing (GSP), we pose pixel prediction as a
graph-signal restoration problem, where the appropriate edge weights of the
underlying graph are computed using a similar patch searched in a semi-local
neighborhood. Specifically, for each candidate patch, we first examine
eigenvalues of its structure tensor to estimate its local smoothness. If
sufficiently smooth, we pose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem using either
a quadratic Laplacian regularizer or a graph total variation (GTV) term as
signal prior. While the MAP problem using the first prior has a closed-form
solution, we design an efficient algorithm for the second prior using
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with nested proximal
gradient descent. Experimental results show that with better quality GSP-based
prediction, at low capacity the visual quality of the embedded image exceeds
state-of-the-art methods noticeably.

fix is to submit a query several times, but this is not applicable in many
situations due to its prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of
independent noise in different repetitions of the same query.
  In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious
user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about
the answer. This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human in noise-prone
regions. We also consider the application of this weak oracle model to the
problem of content search (a variant of the nearest neighbor search problem)
through comparisons. More specifically, we aim at devising efficient algorithms
to locate a target object in a database equipped with a dissimilarity metric
via invocation of the weak comparison oracle. We propose two algorithms termed
WORCS-I and WORCS-II (Weak-Oracle Comparison-based Search), which provably
locate the target object in a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the
target distribution. While WORCS-I provides better theoretical guarantees,
WORCS-II is applicable to more technically challenging scenarios where the
algorithm has limited access to the ranking dissimilarity between objects. A

with TensorFlow that enables users to seamlessly compress models at different
granularities. We evaluate DeepThin on two state-of-the-art acoustic models,
TFKaldi and DeepSpeech, comparing it to previous compression work (Pruning,
HashNet, and Rank Factorization), empirical limit study approaches, and
hand-tuned models. For TFKaldi, our DeepThin networks show better word error

achieving an average of 60% relative improvement over rank factorization, 57%

problem has mixing time $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and
thus provides a nearly linear time sampling algorithm for this problem. A
natural question is the extent to which this algorithm can be parallelized.

First, a residual unit helps when training deep architecture. Second, feature
accumulation with recurrent residual convolutional layers ensures better
feature representation for segmentation tasks. Third, it allows us to design
better U-Net architecture with same number of network parameters with better
performance for medical image segmentation. The proposed models are tested on
three benchmark datasets such as blood vessel segmentation in retina images,

results show superior performance on segmentation tasks compared to equivalent

processes of the two DM species that was assumed to evolve independently.
Moreover, the heterogeneous self-scattering enhances the number of DM being
captured in the Sun mutually. This effect significantly exists in a broad range
of DM mass spectrum. We have studied this phenomena and its implication for the
solar-captured DM annihilation rate. It would be crucial to the DM indirect
detection when the two masses are close. General formalism of the 2DM evolution

Amulet) for salient object detection. The Agile Amulet builds on previous works
to predict saliency maps using multi-level convolutional features. Compared to
previous works, Agile Amulet employs some key innovations to improve training
and testing speed while also increase prediction accuracy. More specifically,
we first introduce a contextual attention module that can rapidly highlight
most salient objects or regions with contextual pyramids. Thus, it effectively
guides the learning of low-layer convolutional features and tells the backbone
network where to look. The contextual attention module is a fully convolutional
mechanism that simultaneously learns complementary features and predicts
saliency scores at each pixel. In addition, we propose a novel method to
aggregate multi-level deep convolutional features. As a result, we are able to
use the integrated side-output features of pre-trained convolutional networks
alone, which significantly reduces the model parameters leading to a model size
of 67 MB, about half of Amulet. Compared to other deep learning based saliency
methods, Agile Amulet is of much lighter-weight, runs faster (30 fps in
real-time) and achieves higher performance on seven public benchmarks in terms
of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

transfer a valuable inferred label to the unlabeled data, we propose a
re-alignment method based on co-occurrence matrix analysis that takes into
account one-hot-vector encoding of the estimated label and the correlation
between the objects in the image. We used an MS-COCO detection dataset to
verify the performance of the proposed SSL method and deformable neural
networks (D-ConvNets) as an object detector for basic training. The performance
of the existing state-of-the-art detectors (DConvNets, YOLO v2, and single shot

different algorithms can be used across different parts of the domain, and
approximations can be used to reduce the computational requirements. We show
here that straight forward implementation incurs accuracy loss for sample sizes

reflectance. Among these groups, the one belonging to the L-class in the
taxonomic classification based on visible and near-infrared spectra exhibit
several peculiar properties. First, their near-infrared spectrum is
characterized by a strong absorption band interpreted as the diagnostic of a
high content of the FeO bearing spinel mineral. This mineral is one of the main
constituents of Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAI) the oldest mineral
compounds found in the solar system. In polarimetry, they possess an uncommonly
large value of the inversion angle incompatible with all known asteroid
belonging to other taxonomical classes. Asteroids found to possess such a high
inversion angle are commonly called Barbarians based on the first asteroid on
which this property was first identified, (234)~Barbara. In this paper we
present the results of an extensive campaign of polarimetric and spectroscopic
observations of L-class objects. We have derived phase-polarization curves for
a sample of 7 Barbarians, finding a variety of inversion angles ranging between
25 and 30$^{\circ}$. Spectral reflectance data exhibit variations in terms of
spectral slope and absorption features in the near-infrared. We analyzed these
data using a Hapke model to obtain some inferences about the relative abundance
of CAI and other mineral compounds. By combining spectroscopic and polarimetric
results, we find evidence that the polarimetric inversion angle is directly
correlated with the presence of CAI, and the peculiar polarimetric properties
of Barbarians are primarily a consequence of their anomalous composition.

images. Rich band information provides more favorable conditions for the
tremendous applications. However, significant increase in the dimensionality of
spectral bands may lead to the curse of dimensionality, especially for
classification applications. Furthermore, there are a large amount of redundant
information among the raw image cubes due to water absorptions, sensor noises
and other influence factors. Band selection is a direct and effective method to
remove redundant information and reduce the spectral dimension for decreasing
computational complexity and avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In this
paper, we present a novel learning framework for band selection based on the
idea of sparse representation. More specifically, first each band is
approximately represented by the linear combination of other bands, then the
original band image can be represented by a multi-dictionary learning
mechanism. As a result, a group of weights can be obtained by sparse
optimization for all bands. Finally, the specific bands will be selected, if
they get higher weights than other bands in the representation of the original
image. Experimental results on three widely used hyperspectral datasets show
that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance in hyperspectral image
classification, when compared with other state-of-art band selection methods.

the variances or the sample sizes in the different groups. Because of time

a substantial loss of power. It is the aim of the present paper, to give an
overview of different methods without such restrictive assumptions and to
identify situations in which one method is superior compared to others. In
particular, after summarizing their underlying assumptions, the different

memory in a double-lambda-type solid ensemble whose spin states are
inhomogeneously broadened. Unlike typical atomic media whose spin decay is
homogeneous, a spin inhomogeneously broadened solid ensemble requires a
counter-intuitive access in the quantum coherence control to avoid spontaneous
emission-caused quantum noises. Such quantum coherence control in a solid
ensemble results in a near perfect retrieval efficiency and is applicable to
ultralong photon storage up to the spin phase relaxation time. Here, the basic
physics of the counter-intuitive quantum coherence control is presented not
only for two-photon (Raman) coherent transients, but also for a detailed
coherence transfer mechanism resulting in frequency up-/down-conversion. This
work sheds light on potential applications of quantum optical memories
satisfying noise free, near perfect, ultralong, and multimode photon storage,
where quantum repeaters, scalable entangled qubits, and magnetometry would be
imminent beneficiaries.

manual annotation of 4,226 README file sections from 393 randomly sampled

features that can categorize these sections automatically. We find that
information discussing the `What' and `How' of a repository is very common,
while many README files lack information regarding the purpose and status of a

in GitHub README files using badges and showed files with and without these
badges to twenty software professionals. The majority of participants perceived
the automated labeling of sections based on our classifier to ease information

that the expansion of the target front surface caused by the first pulse
significantly enhances the hot-electron generation by the second pulse arriving
after a few hundreds of fs time delay. This enhancement, however, does not
suffice to further accelerate the fastest protons driven by the first pulse
once three-dimensional quenching effects have set in. This implies a limit to
the maximum time delay that leads to proton energy enhancement, which we

argon gas within nanoscale confinement is investigated by three-dimensional
molecular dynamics simulations. Utilizing thermalized channel walls, it is
observed that regardless of the channel height and the gas density, the wall
force field affects the density and temperature distributions within
approximately 1 nm from each channel wall. As the gas density is increased for
constant channel height, the relative effect of the wall force field on the
motion of argon gas atoms and, consequently, the maximum normalized gas density
near the walls is decreased. Therefore, for the same Knudsen number, the
temperature jump for this case is higher than what is observed for the case in
which the channel height changes at a constant gas density. The normalized
effective thermal conductivity of the argon gas based on the heat flux that is
obtained by implementation of the Irving-Kirkwood method reveals that the two
cases give the same normalized effective thermal conductivity. For the constant
density case, the total thermal resistance increases as the Knudsen number
decreases while for the constant height case, it reduces considerably.
Meanwhile, it is observed that regardless of the method used to change the
Knudsen number, a considerable portion of the total thermal resistance refers
to interfacial and wall force field thermal resistance even for near micrometer

noncommutative and nonassociative deformations of geometry in non-geometric

in discrete channels with or without memory. In it, the receiver rank orders
noise sequences from most likely to least likely. Subtracting noise from the
received signal in that order, the first instance that results in a member of
the code-book is the ML decoding. We name this algorithm GRAND for Guessing
Random Additive Noise Decoding.
  We establish that GRAND is capacity-achieving when used with random
code-books. For rates below capacity we identify error exponents, and for rates
beyond capacity we identify success exponents. We determine the scheme's
complexity in terms of the number of computations the receiver performs. For
rates beyond capacity, this reveals thresholds for the number of guesses by
which if a member of the code-book is identified it is likely to be the
transmitted code-word.
  We introduce an approximate ML decoding scheme where the receiver abandons
the search after a fixed number of queries, an approach we dub GRANDAB, for
GRAND with ABandonment. While not an ML decoder, we establish that the
algorithm GRANDAB is also capacity-achieving for an appropriate choice of
abandonment threshold, and characterize its complexity, error and success
exponents. Worked examples are presented for Markovian noise that indicate
these decoding schemes substantially out-perform the brute force decoding
approach.

a mean free path of $4\pm2\,\text{nm}$, which is on the order of the average

show that the asymmetric transmission undergoes a dramatic enhancement if the

inclination X-ray binary systems, indicating the presence of an equatorial disc
wind. This launch mechanism is under debate, but thermal driving should be
ubiquitous. X-ray irradiation from the central source heats disc surface,
forming a wind from the outer disc where the local escape velocity is lower
than the sound speed. The mass loss rate from each part of the disc is
determined by the luminosity and spectral shape of the central source. We use
these together with an assumed density and velocity structure of the wind to
predict the column density and ionisation state, then combine this with a Monte
Carlo radiation transfer to predict the detailed shape of the absorption (and
emission) line profiles. We test this on the persistent wind seen in the bright
neutron star binary GX 13+1, with luminosity L/LEdd ~ 0.5. We approximately
include the effect of radiation pressure because of high luminosity, and
compute line features. We compare these to the highest resolution data, the
Chandra third order grating spectra, which we show here for the first time.
This is the first physical model for the wind in this system, and it succeeds
in reproducing many of the features seen in the data, showing that the wind in
GX13+1 is most likely a thermal-radiation driven wind. This approach, combined
with better streamline structures derived from full radiation hydrodynamic
simulations, will allow future calorimeter data to explore the detail wind
structure.

collisions at intermediate energies is a subject of contemporary interest.
Phase transition is usually characterized by the specific behaviour of state
variables like pressure, density, energy etc. In heavy ion collisions there is
no direct way of accessing these state variables and hence unambiguous
detection of phase transition becomes difficult. This work establishes that
signatures of phase transition can be extracted from the observables which are
easily accessible in experiments and these have similar behaviour as the state
variables. The temperature dependence of the first order derivative of the
order parameters related to the largest and second largest cluster size
(produced in heavy ion collisions) exhibit similar behavior as that of the
variation of specific heat at constant volume Cv which is an established
signature of first order phase transition. This motivates us to propose these
derivatives as confirmatory signals of liquid-gas phase transition. The
measurement of these signals in easily feasible in most experiments as compared
to the other signatures like specific heat, caloric curve or bimodality. This
temperature where the peak appears is designated to be the transition
temperature and the effect of certain parameters on this has also been
examined.

approach of Kandasamy et al. (2015), in which the high-dimensional function
decomposes as a sum of lower-dimensional functions on subsets of the underlying
variables. In particular, we significantly generalize this approach by lifting
the assumption that the subsets are disjoint, and consider additive models with
arbitrary overlap among the subsets. By representing the dependencies via a
graph, we deduce an efficient message passing algorithm for optimizing the
acquisition function. In addition, we provide an algorithm for learning the
graph from samples based on Gibbs sampling. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world data.

controlled by the non-equilibrium interplay between colloid-wall interactions

dispersion flow in a confined system is proposed. A momentum and mass balance
founded framework implementing the colloid-interface interactions is
introduced. The framework allows us to depict how interfacial forces drive the
particles and the liquid flows. The interfacially driven flow (osmotic or
Marangoni flows for repulsive or attractive colloid-wall interactions
respectively) can be directly simulated in two-dimensional domains. The ability
of the model to describe the physics of transport in a narrow channel is
discussed in detail. The hydrodynamic nature of osmosis and the associated
counter-pressure are mechanically related to the colloid-interface
interactions. The simulation shows an unexpected transition from axial plug to
pillar accumulation for colloidal accumulation at a channel bottleneck. This
transition has important consequences in transport efficiencies. Existing
limiting cases, such as diffusio-osmosis, are recovered from the simulations,
showing that the framework is physically well-founded. The model generalizes
the existing approaches and proves the hydrodynamic character of osmosis, which
cannot be fully described by purely thermodynamic considerations.

construction of non-trivial anomaly free constraint commutators for the model
exists, that work suffers from two defects. First, Smolin's remarks on the
inability of the quantum dynamics to generate propagation effects apply.
Second, the construction only yields the action of a single Hamiltonian
constraint together with the action of its commutator through a continuum limit
of corresponding discrete approximants; the continuum limit of a product of 2
or more constraints does not exist. Here, we incorporate changes in the quantum
dynamics through structural modifications in the choice of discrete
approximants to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint. The new structure is
motivated by that responsible for propagation in an LQG like quantization of
Paramaterized Field Theory and significantly alters the space of physical
states. We study the off shell constraint algebra of the model in the context
of these structural changes and show that the continuum limit action of
multiple products of Hamiltonian constraints is (a) supported on an appropriate
domain of states (b) yields anomaly free commutators between pairs of

strong upper limits to the actual value of $\mathcal{M}$, further strengthening
our findings of narrow line widths. This finding calls for a reevaluation of
the role of turbulent dissipation and subsonic regions in massive-star and

the coarser spectral resolution used in the previous VLA NH$_3$ studies may
have inhibited the detection of subsonic turbulence in IRDCs. The reduced

Sikorav.
  We offer several applications: we reprove Thurston's theorem on the existence
of a polytope controlling the BNS invariants of a $3$-manifold group; we extend
this result to free-by-cyclic groups, and the more general descending HNN
extensions of free groups. We also show that the BNS invariants of Poincar\'e
duality groups of type $\mathtt{F}$ in dimension $3$ and groups of deficiency
one are determined by a polytope, when the groups are assumed to be agrarian,
that is their integral group rings embed in skew-fields. The latter result
partially confirms a conjecture of Friedl.
  We also deduce the vanishing of the Newton polytopes associated to elements
of the Whitehead groups of many groups satisfying the Atiyah conjecture. We use
this to show that the $L^2$-torsion polytope of Friedl-L\""uck is invariant
under homotopy. We prove the vanishing of this polytope in the presence of
amenability, thus proving a conjecture of Friedl-L\""uck-Tillmann.

are due to strong anharmonic coupling such that all resonances have major

  117",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider the problem of learning, from non-experimental data, the causal
(Markov equivalence) structure of the true, unknown causal Bayesian network
(CBN) on a given, fixed set of (categorical) variables. This learning problem
is known to be so hard that there is no learning algorithm that converges to
the truth for all possible CBNs (on the given set of variables). So the
convergence property has to be sacrificed for some CBNs---but for which? In
response, the standard practice has been to design and employ learning
algorithms that secure the convergence property for at least all the CBNs that
satisfy the famous faithfulness condition, which implies sacrificing the
convergence property for some CBNs that violate the faithfulness condition
(Spirtes et al. 2000). This standard design practice can be justified by
assuming---that is, accepting on faith---that the true, unknown CBN satisfies
the faithfulness condition. But the real question is this: Is it possible to
explain, without assuming the faithfulness condition or any of its weaker
variants, why it is mandatory rather than optional to follow the standard
design practice? This paper aims to answer the above question in the
affirmative. We first define an array of modes of convergence to the truth as
desiderata that might or might not be achieved by a causal learning algorithm.
Those modes of convergence concern (i) how pervasive the domain of convergence
is on the space of all possible CBNs and (ii) how uniformly the convergence
happens. Then we prove a result to the following effect: for any learning
algorithm that tackles the causal learning problem in question, if it achieves
the best achievable mode of convergence (considered in this paper), then it
must follow the standard design practice of converging to the truth for at
least all CBNs that satisfy the faithfulness condition---it is a requirement,
not an option.

inter-domain isolation because the physical memory owned by each domain is
adjacent to each other. To mitigate these attacks, physical domain isolation,
introduced by CATT, physically separates each domain by dividing the physical
memory into multiple partitions and keeping each partition occupied by only one
domain. CATT implemented physical kernel isolation as the first generic and
practical software-only defense to protect kernel from being rowhammered as
kernel is one of the most appealing targets.
  In this paper, we develop a novel exploit that could effectively defeat the
physical kernel isolation and gain both root and kernel privileges. Our exploit
can work without exhausting the page cache or the system memory, or relying on
the information of the virtual-to-physical address mapping. The exploit is
motivated by our key observation that the modern OSes have double-owned kernel
buffers (e.g., video buffers and SCSI Generic buffers) owned concurrently by
the kernel and user domains. The existence of such buffers invalidates the
physical kernel isolation and makes the rowhammer-based attack possible again.
Existing conspicuous rowhammer attacks achieving the root/kernel privilege
escalation exhaust the page cache or even the whole system memory. Instead, we
propose a new technique, named memory ambush. It is able to place the
hammerable double-owned kernel buffers physically adjacent to the target
objects (e.g., page tables) with only a small amount of memory. As a result,
our exploit is stealthier and has fewer memory footprints. We also replace the
inefficient rowhammer algorithm that blindly picks up addresses to hammer with
an efficient one. Our algorithm selects suitable addresses based on an existing
timing channel.

with the analysis of the susceptibility, the nearest-neighbor exchange is found
to be antiferromagnetic at low temperatures, while at temperature of the

amount of kernel code is used. Within the used code, a certain part is invoked
only at runtime while the rest are executed at startup and/or shutdown phases

practical system, named KASR, which transparently reduces attack surfaces of

system, residing in a trusted hypervisor, achieves the attack surface reduction
through a two-step approach: (1) reliably depriving unused code of executable

activating them. We implement a prototype of KASR on Xen-4.8.2 hypervisor and
evaluate its security effectiveness on Linux kernel-4.4.0-87-generic. Our
evaluation shows that KASR reduces the kernel attack surface by 64% and trims
off 40% of CVE vulnerabilities. Besides, KASR successfully detects and blocks
all 6 real-world kernel rootkits. We measure its performance overhead with
three benchmark tools (i.e., SPECINT, httperf and bonnie++). The experimental
results indicate that KASR imposes less than 1% performance overhead (compared

cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not
exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills,
efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain
degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material
success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the
importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well
known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the
population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success
- follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a
Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant
distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind
the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we
suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show
that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in
life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success,
being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our

Kerr-Newmann-(anti-)de Sitter metrics are considered. It is shown how the

that the possibility of introducing a regular frame is indirectly related to
the constancy of a black hole angular velocity and the rate with which the

modulation are represented by a wave--packet of cylindrical symmetry in which
rotons with positive group velocity have a dominant role: The vortex density
modulation can be viewed as a cloud of virtual excitations, mainly rotons,
sustained by the phase of the vortex wave function. This suggests that in a
vortex reconnection some of these rotons become real so that a vortex tangle is
predicted to be a source of non-thermal rotons. The presence of such vorticity
induced rotons can be verified by measurements at low temperature of quantum
evaporation of $^4$He atoms. We estimate the rate of evaporation and this turns
out to be detectable by current instrumentation. Additional information on the

the vicinity of a null point, forming a current sheet and initiating magnetic
reconnection. We consider, for the first time, the case of collapsing 3D
magnetic null points in nonlinear, resistive MHD using numerical simulation,
exploring key physical aspects of the system as well as performing a detailed
parameter study. We find that within a particular plane containing the 3D null,
the plasma and current density enhancements resulting from the collapse are
quantitatively and qualitatively as per the 2D case in both the linear and
nonlinear collapse regimes. However, the scaling with resistivity of the 3D
reconnection rate - which is a global quantity - is found to be less favourable
when the magnetic null point is more rotationally symmetric, due to the action
of increased magnetic back-pressure. Furthermore, we find that with increasing
ambient plasma pressure the collapse can be throttled, as is the case for 2D
nulls. We discuss this pressure-limiting in the context of fast reconnection in
the solar atmosphere and suggest mechanisms by which it may be overcome. We
also discuss the implications of the results in the context of null collapse as
a trigger mechanism of Oscillatory Reconnection, a time-dependent reconnection
mechanism, and also within the wider subject of wave-null point interactions.
We conclude that, in general, increasingly rotationally-asymmetric nulls will

flow-aligning LCPs are the focus in this paper. In the shear flow of monodomain
LCPs it is usually assumed that the spatial distribution of the velocity is
uniform. This is in contrast to polymer solutions, where highly non-uniform
spatial velocity profiles have been observed in experiments. We analyse the ND
model, with an additional gradient term in the constitutive model, using a
linear stability analysis. We investigate the separate cases of constant
applied shear stress, and constant applied shear rate. We find that the ND
model has a transient flow instability to the formation of a spatially
inhomogeneous flow velocity for certain starting orientations of the director.
We calculate the spatially resolved flow profile in both constant applied
stress and constant applied shear rate in start up from rest, using a model
with one spatial dimension to illustrate the flow behaviour of the fluid. For
low shear rates flow reversal can be seen as the director realigns with the
flow direction, whereas for high shear rates the director reorientation occurs
simultaneously across the gap. Experimentally, this inhomogeneous flow is

Arc-Disjoint Cycle Packing problem is to determine whether $D$ has $k$

graphs. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study on the parameterized
complexity of the problem restricted to tournaments. We show that the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable and admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized
by the solution size $k$. In particular, we show that it can be solved in
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k \log k)} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time and has a kernel with
$\mathcal{O}(k)$ vertices. The primary ingredient in both these results is a
min-max theorem that states that every tournament either contains $k$
arc-disjoint triangles or has a feedback arc set of size at most $6k$. Our
belief is that this combinatorial result is of independent interest and could
be useful in other problems related to cycles in tournaments.

paper, motivated by applications in sensor and in transportation networks, we
introduce and study two natural temporal extensions of the classical problem
Vertex Cover. In both cases we wish to minimize the total number of ""vertex

will be discussed in a forthcoming paper. We apply the Richardson-Lucy
deprojection algorithm to data on a two-dimensional (2D) grid. We first test
the 2D deprojection algorithm on a $\beta$-profile. Assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium, we further reconstruct the gravitational potential of a simulated
galaxy cluster based on synthetic SZ and X-ray data. We then reconstruct the
projected gravitational potential of the massive and dynamically active cluster
Abell 2142, based on the X-ray observations collected with XMM-Newton and the
SZ observations from the Planck satellite. Finally, we compute the covariance
matrix of the projected reconstructed potential of the cluster Abell 2142 based

potentials of the simulated cluster recovered from synthetic X-ray and SZ data
are consistent, even though the potential reconstructed from X-rays shows
larger deviations from the true potential. Regarding Abell 2142, the projected

of the best prospects for forming Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones.
To this end, we study the nature of the disc around the very low mass star V410
X-ray 1, whose SED is indicative of an optically thick and very truncated dust
disc, with our modelling suggesting an outer radius of only 0.6 au. We
investigate two scenarios that could lead to such a truncation, and find that
the observed SED is compatible with both. The first scenario involves the
truncation of both the dust and gas in the disc, perhaps due to a previous
dynamical interaction or the presence of an undetected companion. The second
scenario involves the fact that a radial location of 0.6 au is close to the
expected location of the H$_2$O snowline in the disc. As such, a combination of
efficient dust growth, radial migration, and subsequent fragmentation within
the snowline leads to an optically thick inner dust disc and larger, optically
thin outer dust disc. We find that a firm measurement of the CO $J=2$--1 line
flux would enable us to distinguish between these two scenarios, by enabling a
measurement of the radial extent of gas in the disc. Many models we consider
contain at least several Earth-masses of dust interior to 0.6 au, suggesting
that V410 X-ray 1 could be a precursor to a system with tightly-packed inner
planets, such as TRAPPIST-1.

Each cell will then carry an identical (up to parity) configuration which can
however have an arbitrarily random distribution. The dynamics of such models is
compared to that of previous works on regularly distributed black holes as well
as with the standard isotropic dust models of the FLRW type. The irregular
models are shown to have richer dynamics than that of the regular models. The
randomization of the distribution of the black holes is done both without bias

the space-time continuum when deformed from its (A)dS ground state to a flat

Donder-Weyl (DW) Hamiltonian formulation. That framework modifies the
Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian of the free gravitational field by a quadratic
Riemann-Cartan concomitant. The theory predicts a total energy-momentum of the
system of space-time and matter to vanish, in line with the conjecture of a
""Zero-Energy-Universe"" going back to Lorentz (1916) and Levi-Civita (1917).
Consequently a flat geometry can only exist in presence of matter where the
bulk vacuum energy of matter, regardless of its value, is eliminated by the
vacuum energy of space-time.% $\lambda_0$. The observed cosmological constant
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$ is found to be merely a small correction %of the order
$10^{-120} \,\lambda_0$ attributable to deviations from a flat geometry and
effects of complex dynamical geometry of space-time, namely torsion and
possibly also vacuum fluctuations. That quadratic extension of General
Relativity, anticipated already in 1918 by Einstein \cite{einstein18}, thus
provides a significant and natural contribution to resolving the ""cosmological

coinductive predicates. Such recursive proofs allow one to discover proof goals
in the construction of a proof of a coinductive predicate, while still allowing
the use of up-to techniques. This approach lifts the burden to guess
invariants, like bisimulation relations, beforehand. Rather, they allow one to
start with the sought-after proof goal and develop the proof from there until a
point is reached, at which the proof can be closed through a recursion step.
Proofs given in this way are both easier to construct and to understand,
similarly to proofs given in cyclic proof systems or by appealing parameterised
coinduction.
  In this paper, we develop a framework for recursive proofs of coinductive
predicates that are given through fibrational predicate liftings. This
framework is built on the so-called later modality, which has made its
appearance in type theoretic settings before. In particular, we show the
soundness and completeness of recursive proofs, we prove that compatible up-to

reaction rate constants governing stochastic kinetic models (SKMs) is
considered. Given the challenges underlying this problem, the Markov jump
process representation is routinely replaced by an approximation based on a
suitable time discretisation of the system of interest. Improving the accuracy
of these schemes amounts to using an ever finer discretisation level, which in
the context of the inference problem, requires integrating over the uncertainty
in the process at a predetermined number of intermediate times between
observations. Pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings schemes are increasingly
used, since for a given discretisation level, the observed data likelihood can
be unbiasedly estimated using a particle filter. When observations are
particularly informative an auxiliary particle filter can be implemented, by
employing an appropriate construct to push the state particles towards the
observations in a sensible way. Recent work in state-space settings has shown
how the pseudo-marginal approach can be made much more efficient by correlating
the underlying pseudo-random numbers used to form the likelihood estimate at
the current and proposed values of the unknown parameters. We extend this
approach to the time-discretised SKM framework by correlating the innovations
that drive the auxiliary particle filter. We find that the resulting approach
offers substantial gains in efficiency over a standard implementation.

flow over a concave wall, and excited by a row of roughness elements with
span-wise separation in the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer

utilized, wherein the Navier-Stokes equations are reduced to the boundary

appropriate Prandtl transformation. In the optimal control strategy, the wall
displacement or the wall transpiration velocity serve as control variables,
while the cost functional is defined in terms of the wall shear stress. Our

turbulent systems containing a large number of positive Lyapunov exponents
results in a rapid growth of small uncertainties, requiring naturally a
probabilistic characterization for the evolution of the turbulent system.
Uncertainty quantification in turbulent dynamical systems is a grand challenge
where the goal is to obtain statistical estimates such as the change in mean
and variance for key physical quantities in their nonlinear responses to
changes in external forcing parameters or uncertain initial data. One central
issue in contemporary research is the development of a systematic methodology
that can recover the crucial features of the natural system in statistical
equilibrium (model fidelity) and improve the imperfect model prediction skill
in response to various external perturbations (model sensitivity). A general
mathematical framework to construct statistically accurate reduced-order models
that have skill in capturing the statistical variability in the principal
directions with largest energy of a general class of damped and forced complex
turbulent dynamical systems is discussed here. The methods are developed under
a universal class of turbulent dynamical systems with quadratic nonlinearity
that is representative in many applications in applied mathematics and

demonstrated on instructive stochastic triad models. Recent applications to

specific parameters. The selection of the physical schemes and the choice of
the corresponding physical parameters during model configuration can
significantly impact the accuracy of model forecasts. There is no combination
of physical schemes that works best for all times, at all locations, and under
all conditions. It is therefore of considerable interest to understand the
interplay between the choice of physics and the accuracy of the resulting
forecasts under different conditions. This paper demonstrates the use of
machine learning techniques to study the uncertainty in numerical weather
prediction models due to the interaction of multiple physical processes. The
first problem addressed herein is the estimation of systematic model errors in
output quantities of interest at future times, and the use of this information
to improve the model forecasts. The second problem considered is the
identification of those specific physical processes that contribute most to the
forecast uncertainty in the quantity of interest under specified meteorological
conditions.
  The discrepancies between model results and observations at past times are
used to learn the relationships between the choice of physical processes and
the resulting forecast errors. Numerical experiments are carried out with the
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The output quantity of interest
is the model precipitation, a variable that is both extremely important and
very challenging to forecast. The physical processes under consideration
include various micro-physics schemes, cumulus parameterizations, short wave,

particularly useful in practice, as many applications involve a seasonal

also give sufficient conditions for the strong consistency of the maximum

the tube during internal arcing events. Crowbar is used to protect the MWT by
diverting the energy during fault. To compute the energy released into the MWT,
the dc fault current model and the MWT model are essential. An equivalent fuse
wire model is utilized for the MWT for the crowbar applications. The paper
proposes a model for the dc fault current, the analysis for which is based on
Joules Integral energy concept. The model provides flexibility to choose a
range of practically observed reactance to resistance ratio (X/R) of
transformer and also allows the use of a range of dc current limiting
resistances that are utilized in the High Voltage (HV) power supply circuits in
Microwave applications. The non-linearity of the system due to the multipulse
diode rectifier is also considered by introducing a correction factor in the
model. This paper shows that the same correction factor can be applied for both
dc side parallel and series connected rectifier circuits. Both dc fault current

  Things",,,"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2813429",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new energy harvesting strategy that uses a dedicated energy
source (ES) to optimally replenish energy for radio frequency (RF) energy
harvesting powered Internet of Things. Specifically, we develop a two-step dual
tunnel energy requesting (DTER) strategy that minimizes the energy consumption
on both the energy harvesting device and the ES. Besides the causality and
capacity constraints that are investigated in the existing approaches, DTER
also takes into account the overhead issue and the nonlinear charge
characteristics of an energy storage component to make the proposed strategy
practical. Both offline and online scenarios are considered in the second step
of DTER. To solve the nonlinear optimization problem of the offline scenario,
we convert the design of offline optimal energy requesting problem into a
classic shortest path problem and thus a global optimal solution can be
obtained through dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. The online suboptimal
transmission strategy is developed as well. Simulation study verifies that the
online strategy can achieve almost the same energy efficiency as the global
optimal solution in the long term.

  Communications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1802.03908",,,,"eess.SP cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cognitive radio (CR) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been
deemed two promising technologies due to their potential to achieve high
spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. This paper studies a
multiple-input single-output NOMA CR network relying on simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) conceived for supporting a massive
population of power limited battery-driven devices. In contrast to most of the
existing works, which use an ideally linear energy harvesting model, this study
applies a more practical non-linear energy harvesting model. In order to
improve the security of the primary network, an artificial-noise-aided
cooperative jamming scheme is proposed. The artificial-noise-aided beamforming
design problems are investigated subject to the practical secrecy rate and
energy harvesting constraints. Specifically, the transmission power
minimization problems are formulated under both perfect channel state
information (CSI) and the bounded CSI error model. The problems formulated are
non-convex, hence they are challenging to solve. A pair of algorithms either
using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or a cost function are proposed for solving
these problems. Our simulation results show that the proposed cooperative
jamming scheme succeeds in establishing secure communications and NOMA is
capable of outperforming the conventional orthogonal multiple access in terms
of its power efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that the cost function
algorithm outperforms the SDR-based algorithm.

method to correct the LED misalignment of FPM, termed as misalignment
correction for FPM (mcFPM). Although different regions in the FOV have
different sensitivity to the LED misalignment, the experimental results show
that mcFPM is robust to eliminate the degradation in each region. Compared with
the state-of-the-art methods, mcFPM is much faster.
