  Optimizations","17 pages",,,,"cs.CE econ.GN math.OC q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that demand response can improve the system efficiency as
well as lower consumers' (prosumers') electricity bills. However, it is not
clear how we can either qualitatively identify the prosumer with the most
impact potential or quantitatively estimate each prosumer's contribution to the
total social welfare improvement when additional resource capacity/flexibility
is introduced to the system with demand response, such as allowing net-selling
behavior. In this work, we build upon existing literature on the electricity
market, which consists of price-taking prosumers each with various appliances,
an electric utility company and a social welfare optimizing distribution system
operator, to design a general sensitivity analysis approach (GSAA) that can
estimate the potential of each consumer's contribution to the social welfare
when given more resource capacity. GSAA is based on existence of an efficient
competitive equilibrium, which we establish in the paper. When prosumers'
utility functions are quadratic, GSAA can give closed forms characterization on
social welfare improvement based on duality analysis. Furthermore, we extend
GSAA to a general convex settings, i.e., utility functions with strong
convexity and Lipschitz continuous gradient. Even without knowing the specific
forms the utility functions, we can derive upper and lower bounds of the social
welfare improvement potential of each prosumer, when extra resource is
introduced. For both settings, several applications and numerical examples are
provided: including extending AC comfort zone, ability of EV to discharge and
net selling. The estimation results show that GSAA can be used to decide how to
allocate potentially limited market resources in the most impactful way.

  shallow tents of fluids",,,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hydrodynamics and confinement dominate bacterial mobility near solid or
air-water boundaries, causing flagellated bacteria to move in circular
trajectories. This phenomenon results from the counter-rotation between the
bacterial body and flagella and lateral drags on them in opposite directions
due to their proximity to the boundaries. Numerous experimental techniques have
been developed to confine and maneuver motile bacteria. Here, we report
observations on Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp. when they are confined
within a thin layer of water around dispersed micrometer-sized particles
sprinkled over a semi-solid agar gel. In this setting, the flagellated bacteria
orbit around the dispersed particles akin to planetary systems. The liquid
layer is shaped like a shallow tent with its height at the center set by the
seeding particle and the meniscus profile set by the strong surface tension of
water. The tent-shaped constraint and the left handedness of the flagellar
filaments result in exclusively clockwise circular trajectories. The thin fluid
layer is resilient due to a balance between evaporation and reinforcing fluid
pumped out of the agar. The latter is driven by the Laplace pressure caused by
the curved meniscus. This novel mechanism to entrap bacteria within a minimal
volume of fluid is relevant to near surface bacterial accumulation, adhesion,
biofilm growth, development of bio-microdevices, and cleansing hygiene.

Estimating
the relative angles, delays, and Doppler shifts from the received signals
allows to determine the locations and velocities of objects. However, due to
practical constraints, the probing signals have finite bandwidth B, the
received signals are observed over a finite time interval of length T only, and
a radar typically has only one or a few transmit and receive antennas. These
constraints fundamentally limit the resolution up to which objects can be
distinguished. Specifically, a radar can not distinguish objects with delay and
Doppler shifts much closer than 1/B and 1/T, respectively, and a radar system
with N_T transmit and N_R receive antennas cannot distinguish objects with
angels closer than 1/(N_T N_R). As a consequence, the delay, Doppler, and
angular resolution of standard radars is proportional to 1/B and 1/T, and
1/(N_T N_R). In this chapter, we show that the continuous angle-delay-Doppler
triplets and the corresponding attenuation factors can be resolved at much
finer resolution, using ideas from compressive sensing. Specifically, provided
the angle-delay-Doppler triplets are separated either by factors proportional

be recovered a significantly smaller scale or higher resolution.

back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. We introduce a simple
stochastic algorithm (\textit{h}-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization
and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, we show that when
the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path
(cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed. Based on the
hypothesis that these components carry information about long term dependencies
(which we show empirically), their suppression can prevent LSTMs from capturing
them. Our algorithm\footnote{Our code is available at
https://github.com/bhargav104/h-detach.} prevents gradients flowing through
this path from getting suppressed, thus allowing the LSTM to capture such

the angular momentum of stars seen in distant galaxies, and that this could be
interpreted as an additional mass inside the orbit of the star. It is tempting
to identify this with the modifications of Newtonian dynamics that have been
claimed [1] to eliminate the necessity for dark matter. Simple estimates of the
effect show that it is very small and does not have the right functional form
to explain the Tully-Fisher relation. The effect does grow with the age of the
universe, but if our universe is indeed dominated by a cosmological constant,
then most galaxies will disappear beyond the cosmological horizon before the
effect is observable. We conjecture that this effect can be thought of as a new
kind of gravitational memory: a rotation of frames at infinity, relative to
those near the galaxy. One of the conclusions of our work is that at very large
times the linearized classical treatment of this problem is inadequate, and
should be replaced by Weinberg's soft photon resummation. However, these times
are so long that they do not appear relevant to the universe in which we live.

affects the performance of DL applications. In this work, we characterize the
I/O performance and scaling of TensorFlow, an open-source programming framework

measure TensorFlow I/O performance, we first design a micro-benchmark to
measure TensorFlow reads, and then use a TensorFlow mini-application based on
AlexNet to measure the performance cost of I/O and checkpointing in TensorFlow.
To improve the checkpointing performance, we design and implement a burst
buffer. We find that increasing the number of threads increases TensorFlow
bandwidth by a maximum of 2.3x and 7.8x on our benchmark environments. The use
of the tensorFlow prefetcher results in a complete overlap of computation on
accelerator and input pipeline on CPU eliminating the effective cost of I/O on
the overall performance. The use of a burst buffer to checkpoint to a fast
small capacity storage and copy asynchronously the checkpoints to a slower
large capacity storage resulted in a performance improvement of 2.6x with

structure with respect to some ranking function that is mandated by a
scheduling policy. It is the core component in many recent innovations to
optimize network performance and utilization. Our focus in this paper is on the
design and deployment of packet scheduling in software. Software schedulers
have several advantages over hardware including shorter development cycle and
flexibility in functionality and deployment location. We substantially improve
current software packet scheduling performance, while maintaining flexibility,
by exploiting underlying features of packet ranking; namely, packet ranks are
integers and, at any point in time, fall within a limited range of values. We
introduce Eiffel, a novel programmable packet scheduling system. At the core of
Eiffel is an integer priority queue based on the Find First Set (FFS)
instruction and designed to support a wide range of policies and ranking
functions efficiently. As an even more efficient alternative, we also propose a
new approximate priority queue that can outperform FFS-based queues for some
scenarios. To support flexibility, Eiffel introduces novel programming
abstractions to express scheduling policies that cannot be captured by current,
state-of-the-art scheduler programming models. We evaluate Eiffel in a variety
of settings and in both kernel and userspace deployments. We show that it
outperforms state of the art systems by 3-40x in terms of either number of
cores utilized for network processing or number of flows given fixed processing
capacity.

expected to significantly improve quality of service delivered by Application
Service Providers (ASPs) in a flexible and economic way. However, placing edge
service in every possible edge site by an ASP is practically infeasible due to
the ASP's prohibitive budget requirement. In this paper, we investigate the
edge service placement problem of an ASP under a limited budget, where the ASP
dynamically rents computing/storage resources in edge sites to host its
applications in close proximity to end users. Since the benefit of placing edge
service in a specific site is usually unknown to the ASP a priori, optimal
placement decisions must be made while learning this benefit. We pose this
problem as a novel combinatorial contextual bandit learning problem. It is
""combinatorial"" because only a limited number of edge sites can be rented to
provide the edge service given the ASP's budget. It is ""contextual"" because we
utilize user context information to enable finer-grained learning and decision
making. To solve this problem and optimize the edge computing performance, we
propose SEEN, a Spatial-temporal Edge sErvice placemeNt algorithm. Furthermore,
SEEN is extended to scenarios with overlapping service coverage by
incorporating a disjunctively constrained knapsack problem. In both cases, we
prove that our algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound when it is compared
to an oracle algorithm that knows the exact benefit information. Simulations
are carried out on a real-world dataset, whose results show that SEEN
significantly outperforms benchmark solutions.

Pendulum (WIP) Humanoids. WIP Humanoids are redundant manipulators dynamically
balancing themselves on wheels. Characterized by several degrees of freedom,
they have the ability to perform several tasks simultaneously, such as
balancing, maintaining a body pose, controlling the gaze, lifting a load or
maintaining end-effector configuration in operation space. The problem of
whole-body control is to enable simultaneous performance of these tasks with
optimal participation of all degrees of freedom at specified priorities for
each objective. The control also has to obey constraint of angle and torque
limits on each joint. The proposed approach is hierarchical with a low level
controller for body joints manipulation and a high-level controller that
defines center of mass (CoM) targets for the low-level controller to control
zero dynamics of the system driving the wheels. The low-level controller plans
for shorter horizons while considering more complete dynamics of the system,
while the high-level controller plans for longer horizon based on an
approximate model of the robot for computational efficiency.

significant tasks in biomedical research and clinical practice. In this paper,
we design a new cell detection and localization algorithm that combines deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) and compressed sensing (CS) or sparse coding
(SC) for end-to-end training. We also derive, for the first time, a
backpropagation rule, which is applicable to train any algorithm that
implements a sparse code recovery layer. The key observation behind our
algorithm is that cell detection task is a point object detection task in
computer vision, where the cell centers (i.e., point objects) occupy only a
tiny fraction of the total number of pixels in an image. Thus, we can apply
compressed sensing (or, equivalently sparse coding) to compactly represent a
variable number of cells in a projected space. Then, CNN regresses this
compressed vector from the input microscopy image. Thanks to the SC/CS recovery
algorithm (L1 optimization) that can recover sparse cell locations from the
output of CNN. We train this entire processing pipeline end-to-end and
demonstrate that end-to-end training provides accuracy improvements over a
training paradigm that treats CNN and CS-recovery layers separately. Our
algorithm design also takes into account a form of ensemble average of trained
models naturally to further boost accuracy of cell detection. We have validated
our algorithm on benchmark datasets and achieved excellent performances.

For an
undirected graph, 3-node graphlets include close triangle and open triangle.
When k = 4, there are six types of graphlets, e.g., tailed-triangle and clique
are two possible 4-node graphlets. The number of each graphlet, called graphlet
count, is a signature which characterizes the local network structure of a
given graph. Graphlet count plays a prominent role in network analysis of many
fields, most notably bioinformatics and social science.
  However, computing exact graphlet count is inherently difficult and
computational expensive because the number of graphlets grows exponentially
large as the graph size and/or graphlet size k grow. To deal with this
difficulty, many sampling methods were proposed to estimate graphlet count with
bounded error. Nevertheless, these methods require large number of samples to
be statistically reliable, which is still computationally demanding. Moreover,
they have to repeat laborious counting procedure even if a new graph is similar
or exactly the same as previous studied graphs.
  Intuitively, learning from historic graphs can make estimation more accurate
and avoid many repetitive counting to reduce computational cost. Based on this
idea, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework and two
preprocessing techniques to estimate graphlet count. Extensive experiments on
two types of random graphs and real world biochemistry graphs show that our
framework can offer substantial speedup on estimating graphlet count of new
graphs with high accuracy.

Neighborhood Construction by Apollonius Region Density (NCARD). In this study,
the neighbors of data points are determined using not only the geometric

survival challenge so lethal that it prevents virtually all species from
evolving to an advanced stage. This paper argues that the Great Filter would be
not one single factor, but rather simply the statistics of survival in an
always-dangerous universe. The frequency of species that survive multiple
existential threats would likely obey a power law such as Lotka's Law, such
that the frequency of survivors would diminish as an inverse power of the
number of threats. Since any species that advances to the point at which it is
detectable on an interstellar scale likely must survive a large number of
existential threats, by Lotka's Law the number of such survivors would be a
very small fraction of the candidate species that evolve on various planets.

acceleration discrepancies in regions of system-parameter space that are not
accessible in well-studied galactic systems, such as galaxies, galaxy clusters,
and dwarf-spheroidal satellites of galaxies. Groups are typically the size of
galaxy-cluster cores, but have masses typically only a few times that of a
single galaxy. Accelerations in groups get far below those in galaxies, and far
below the MOND acceleration. So much so, that many groups might be affected by
the external-field effect, which is unique to MOND, due to background
accelerations. Here, I analyze the MOND dynamics of 53 galaxy groups, recently
catalogued in 3 lists. Their Newtonian, K-band, dynamical $M/L$ ratios are a
few tens to several hundreds solar units, with $\langle{M_d/L_K}\rangle= (56,
25, 30)~M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$, respectively for the 3 lists; thus evincing very
large acceleration discrepancies. I find here that MOND requires dynamical
$M_M/L_K$ values of order $1~M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$, with
$\langle{M_M/L_K}\rangle=(0.8, 0.56, 1.0) ~M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$, for the 3
lists, which are in good agreement with population-synthesis stellar values,
and with those found in individual galaxies. MOND thus accounts for the
observed dynamics in those groups with baryons alone, and no need for dark
matter -- an important extension of MOND analysis from galaxies to galactic
systems, which, to boot, have characteristic sizes of several hundred
kiloparsecs, and accelerations much lower than probed before -- only a few
percent of MOND's $a_0$. The acceleration discrepancies evinced by these groups
thus conform to the deep-MOND prediction: $g\approx (g_Na_0)^{1/2}$, down to
these very low accelerations ($g$ is the measured, and $g_N$ the baryonic,
Newtonian acceleration).

equation for quantum gas mixtures with generalized differential cross-sections.
Spatially-homogeneous relaxation problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM
conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine and spectral accuracy,
respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such
as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by
the FSM, which compare well with analytical solutions. Then, we apply the FSM
to find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the
linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal
conductivity of the three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting
through hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative
difference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients
increases with the fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in the
thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical
to the degenerate limits, but that in the shear viscosity decreases. Finally,
the shear viscosity and diffusion coefficient have also been calculated for a
two-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases. When the molecular mass of
the two components are the same, our numerical results agree well with the
variational solution. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large
discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our
results are reliable because (i) the method relies on no assumption and (ii)
the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density satisfies the minimum
bound predicted by the string theory.

including polar molecules with large electric dipole moments, have led to
vigorous theoretical activities. Recent reporting of observation of roton
feature in dipolar erbium has provided added impetus to theoretical and
experimental work. Here we discuss our mean-field theory work on 2D and
quasi-2D dipolar bosons with dipoles oriented at an angle to the direction
perpendicular to the confining 2D plane, i.e. for {\it non-zero tilt angles}.
Using Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we present results on a number of T=0
properties of both 2D and quasi-2D systems, such as excitation spectra,
structure functions, sound velocities, quantum depletion, etc. We explore
instabilities at varying tilt angle, density and dipolar coupling. We map out
phase diagrams as a function of tilt angle, dipole strength and density. We
find the development of maxon-roton behavior leading to roton instabilities at
large densities for small tilt angles, and at low densities for large tilt
angles. The behavior is anisotropic in k-space; accordingly the roton
instabilities occur first in the $k_y$ direction, suggestive of inhomogeneity
and stripe phase, with density mode becoming soft in the $y$-direction. Beyond
a critical tilt angle, at any density, the dipolar system collapses owing to a
phonon instability. We discuss similarities and differences between the
properties of 2D and quasi-2D dipolar systems at non-zero tilt angles.

statistics of anyon. This knot lattice model bears abelian and non-abelian
anyons as well as integral and fractional filling states that is similar to
quantum Hall system. The fusion rules of anyon are explicitly demonstrated by
braiding on crossing states of the multi-knot lattice. The statistical
character of anyon is quantified by topological linking number of multi-knot
link. Long-range coupling interaction is a fundamental character of this knot
lattice model. The short range coupling models, such as Ising model, fermion
paring model, Kitaev honeycomb lattice model and so on, appears as the short
range coupling case of the knot lattice model. We introduced link lattice
pattern as geometric representation of the eigenstate of quantum many body
model to explore the topological nature of quantum eigen-states. For example, a
convection flow loop is introduced into the well-know BCS fermions pairing
model to show the Pseudo-gap state in unconventional super-conducting state.
The integral and fractional filling numbers in quantum Hall system is directly
quantized by topological linking number. The quantum phase transition between
different quantum states in quantum spin model is also directly quantified by
the change of topological linking number, which revealed topological character
of phase transition. This multi-knot lattice has a promising physical
implementation by circularized photons in optical firbre network. It may also
provide another different path to topological quantum computation.

accuracy (in terms of the wavenumber-diffusion properties) for several popular
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) viscous flux formulations. The considered methods
include the symmetric interior penalty formulation (SIPG), the first and second
approaches of Bassi and Rebay (BR1, BR2), and the local discontinuous Galerkin
method (LDG). For the purpose of stability, we consider the von Neumann
stability analysis method for uniform grids with a periodic boundary condition.
In addition, the combined-mode analysis approach previously introduced for the
wave equation is utilized to analyze the dissipative error. This new approach
can be used to study the performance of a particular DG and Runge-Kutta DG
(RKDG) scheme for the entire extended wavenumber range. Thus, more insights
into the robustness as well as accuracy and efficiency can be obtained. For
instance, the LDG method provides larger dissipation for high-wavenumber
components than the BR1 and BR2 approaches for short time simulations in
addition to a lower error bound for long time simulations. The BR1 approach
with added dissipation can have desirable properties and stability similar to
BR2. For BR2, the penalty parameter can be adjusted to enhance the performance
of the scheme. The results are verified through canonical numerical tests.

investigated different experimental conditions. Materials and methods: AuNPs
(30 nm) were functionalized by conjugation of the antibody cetuximab against
EGFR. Selective binding of the particles was demonstrated by silver staining,
multiphoton imaging, and fluorescence-lifetime imaging. After laser
irradiation, membrane permeability of OVCAR-3 cells was studied under different
conditions of AuNP concentration, cell-incubation medium, and cell - AuNP
incubation time. Membrane permeability and cell viability were evaluated by
flow cytometry, measuring propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate -
dextran uptake. Results: Adherently growing OVCAR-3 cells can be effectively
targeted with EGFR-AuNP. Laser irradiation led to successful permeabilization,
and 150 kDa dextran was successfully delivered into cells with about 70%

used to deliver molecules into adherent cells. Efficacy depends not only on
laser parameters but also on AuNP:cell ratio, cell-incubation medium, and cell

form the streamwise velocity energy spectrum from the viscosity- to the
inertia-dominated range of scales. Definite scaling-trends for streamwise
spectra have remained empirically elusive, although a prominent school of
thought stems from the works of Perry and Abell (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 79, 1977,
pp. 785-799) and Perry et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 165, 1986, pp. 163-199),
which were greatly inspired by the attached-eddy hypothesis of Townsend (The
Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, Cambridge University Press, 1976). In this
paper, we re-examine the turbulence kinetic energy of the streamwise velocity
component in the context of the spectral decompositions of Perry and coworkers.
Two universal spectral filters are derived via spectral coherence analysis of
two-point velocity signals, spanning a Reynolds number range $Re_\tau \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and form the basis for our
decomposition of the logarithmic-region turbulence into stochastically
wall-detached and wall-attached portions of energy. The latter is composed of
scales larger than a streamwise/wall-normal ratio of $\lambda_x/z \approx 14$.
If the decomposition is accepted, a $k_x^{-1}$ scaling region can only appear
for $Re_\tau \geq 80\,000$, at a wall-normal position of $z^+ = 100$. Following
Perry and co-workers, it is hypothesized that spectral contributions from
turbulence structures other than attached eddies obscure a $k_x^{-1}$ scaling.
When accepting the idea of different spectral contributions it is furthermore
shown that a broad outer-spectral peak is present even at low $Re_\tau$.

would split the eight-fold degeneracy (including valley and physical spin) of
these zeroth pseudo Landau levels, and may lead to insulating phases with
non-vanishing Chern numbers at integer fillings. Besides, we show that all the
high-energy bands below or above the flat bands are also topologically
nontrivial in the sense that for each valley the sum of their Berry phases is
quantized as $\pm\pi$. Such quantized Berry phases give rise to nearly flat
edge states, which are dependent on truncations on the moir\'e length scale.
Our work provides a complete and clear picture for the electronic structure and
topological properties of TBG, and has significant implications on the natrue
of the correlated insulating phase observed in experiments.

scaling of the turbulence intensity in more depth, in comparison to evaluating
the total streamwise turbulence intensity. Based on universal trends across all
Reynolds numbers considered, some evidence is given for a Townsend--Perry

decay of the turbulence intensity per Townsend's attached-eddy hypothesis. It
is also demonstrated how this constant can be consistent with the
Reynolds-number increase of the streamwise turbulence intensity in the

with a weak $^{56}$Ni mixing is characterized by three different phases:
initial rapid reddening, blueward evolution due to the delayed effect of
$^{56}$Ni heating, and redward evolution thereafter until the transition to the
nebular phase. With a strong $^{56}$Ni mixing, the second phase disappears. We
compare our models with the early-time color evolution of several SNe Ib/Ic

distinct from SN Ic progenitors in terms of helium content and that $^{56}$Ni
mixing is generally stronger in the carbon-oxygen core and weaker in the

bacteria-inspired uniflagellar robot in a fluid medium at low Reynolds number.
Inspired by the mechanism behind the locomotion of flagellated bacteria, we
consider a robot comprised of a flagellum -- a flexible helical filament --
attached to a spherical head. The flagellum rotates about the head at a
controlled angular velocity and generates a propulsive force that moves the
robot forward. When the angular velocity exceeds a threshold value, the
hydrodynamic force exerted by the fluid can cause the soft flagellum to buckle,
characterized by a dramatic change in shape. In this computational study, a
fluid-structure interaction model that combines Discrete Elastic Rods (DER)
algorithm with Lighthill's Slender Body Theory (LSBT) is employed to simulate
the locomotion and deformation of the robot. We demonstrate that the robot can
follow a prescribed path in three dimensional space by exploiting buckling of
the flagellum. The control scheme involves only a single (binary) scalar input
-- the angular velocity of the flagellum. By triggering the buckling
instability at the right moment, the robot can follow an arbitrary path in
three dimensional space. We also show that the complexity of the dynamics of
the helical filament can be captured using a deep neural network, from which we
identify the input-output functional relationship between the control inputs
and the trajectory of the robot. Furthermore, our study underscores the
potential role of buckling in the locomotion of natural bacteria.

vehicles (AUVs) localization under the assumption that the sound propagates
straightly underwater at a constant speed. Considering that the underwater
acoustic waves propagate along bent curves at varying speeds in practice, it
becomes much more challenging to determine a proper anchor deployment
configuration. In this paper, taking the practical variability of underwater
sound speed into account, we investigate the anchor-AUV geometry problem in a
3-D time-of-flight (ToF) based underwater scenario from the perspective of
localization accuracy. To address this problem, we first rigorously derive the
Jacobian matrix of measurement errors to quantify the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) with a widely-adopted isogradient sound speed profile (SSP). We then
formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the CRLB subject
to the angle and range constraints to figure out the anchor-AUV geometry, which
is multivariate and nonlinear and thus generally hard to handle. For
mathematical tractability, by adopting tools from the estimation theory, we
interestingly find that this problem can be equivalently transformed into a
more explicit univariate optimization problem. By this, we obtain an
easy-to-implement anchor-AUV geometry that yields satisfactory localization
performance, referred to as the uniform sea-surface circumference (USC)
deployment. Extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and
show that our proposed USC scheme outperforms both the cube and the random
deployment schemes in terms of localization accuracy under the same parameter

simultaneously then rendezvous is impossible. What happens for symmetric
initial positions with non-simultaneous start? Can symmetry between the agents

  In order to answer these questions, we consider {\em space-time initial

$[(u,v),\delta]$, where $u$ and $v$ are initial nodes of the agents in some
graph and $\delta$ is a non-negative integer that represents the difference

accomplishes rendezvous for all of them without {\em any } a priori knowledge

samples in advance, and reuse the result in each iteration, which is practical.
Experiments are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

system, namely, the supersymmetric states. We investigate the problem whether
they admit the symmetrically separable decomposition, i.e., each term in this
decomposition is a supersymmetric pure product state $|x,x\rangle\langle x,x|$,
which are called S-separable. We conjecture that any supersymmetric states are
S-separable and we prove that this conjecture holds when the rank is less than
or equal to 3 or $N$. Moreover, we propose another weaker conjecture that any
separable supersymmetric states are S-separable. It was proved to be true when
the rank is less than or equal to $4$ or $N+1$. We also propose a numerical
algorithm which is able to detect S-separability. Besides, we analysis the
convergence behavior of this algorithm. Some numerical examples are tested to
show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

(GRBs). Several previous studies have suggested that the prompt emission
spectrum of GRBs is likely to consist of a few components that may arise from
different jet compositions. Here we present a systematic analysis to search for
the GRBs that seem to show the transition from a fireball to the
Poynting-flux-dominated outflow between well-separated pulses within a single
burst, like the GRB 160626B, using the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the
\emph{Fermi} satellite. We obtain 43 GRBs with clear multiple pulses and find
that 9/43 (21\%) bursts may exhibit such a transition based on the
time-integrated spectral analysis. We then select a further four bursts with
the data of adequate quality to perform a detailed time-resolved spectral
analysis, and we find that in three bursts the thermal-like pulse is a
precursor. Furthermore, based on the time-resolved spectra, we constrain the
outflow properties for those thermal pulses and find them consistent with the
typical properties of the photosphere emission. Also, the later pulses with the
softer low-energy spectral index are compatible with the optically thin
synchrotron emission model. Our analysis indicates that a good fraction of the
multipulse {\it Fermi} bursts may obtain the transition from fireball to the
Poynting-flux-dominated outflow.

techniques are often used to construct sparse (predictive) models. Most
regularization strategies only work for data where all predictors are treated
identically, such as Lasso regression for (continuous) predictors treated as
linear effects. However, many predictive problems involve different types of
predictors and require a tailored regularization term. We propose a multi-type
Lasso penalty that acts on the objective function as a sum of subpenalties, one
for each type of predictor. As such, we allow for predictor selection and level
fusion within a predictor in a data-driven way, simultaneous with the parameter
estimation process. We develop a new estimation strategy for convex predictive
models with this multi-type penalty. Using the theory of proximal operators,
our estimation procedure is computationally efficient, partitioning the overall
optimization problem into easier to solve subproblems, specific for each
predictor type and its associated penalty. Earlier research applies
approximations to non-differentiable penalties to solve the optimization
problem. The proposed SMuRF algorithm removes the need for approximations and
achieves a higher accuracy and computational efficiency. This is demonstrated
with an extensive simulation study and the analysis of a case-study on
insurance pricing analytics.

dynamics of area-preserving homeomorphisms. We will show that the barcode of a
Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a surface depends continuously on the
diffeomorphism, and furthermore define barcodes for Hamiltonian homeomorphisms.
  Our main dynamical application concerns the notion of {\it weak conjugacy},
an equivalence relation which arises naturally in connection to $C^0$
continuous conjugacy invariants of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms. We show that for
a large class of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms with a finite number of fixed
points, the number of fixed points, counted with multiplicity, is a weak
conjugacy invariant. The proof relies, in addition to the theory of barcodes,
on techniques from surface dynamics such as Le Calvez's theory of transverse
foliations.
  In our exposition of barcodes and persistence modules, we present a proof of
the Isometry Theorem which incorporates Barannikov's theory of simple Morse
complexes.

strength and various degrees of persistence. Variable selection in such a
context is of great importance. In this paper, we explore the pitfalls and
possibilities of the LASSO methods in this predictive regression framework. In
the presence of stationary, local unit root, and cointegrated predictors, we
show that the adaptive LASSO cannot asymptotically eliminate all cointegrating
variables with zero regression coefficients. This new finding motivates a novel
post-selection adaptive LASSO, which we call the twin adaptive LASSO (TAlasso),
to restore variable selection consistency. Accommodating the system of
heterogeneous regressors, TAlasso achieves the well-known oracle property. In
contrast, conventional LASSO fails to attain coefficient estimation consistency
and variable screening in all components simultaneously. We apply these LASSO
methods to evaluate the short- and long-horizon predictability of S\&P 500
excess returns.

family, such as Li, Be, B, are expected to have significant implications on our
understanding of the cosmic ray origin and propagation. Here we employ the
recent very precise measurements of those species by the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer on the International Space Station, together with their parent
species (C and O), as well as the data collected by the Voyager-1 spacecraft
outside the heliosphere and the Advanced Composition Explorer, to investigate
the propagation of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. We consider the diffusion of
cosmic rays plus reacceleration or convection effect during the propagation,
and find that the reacceleration model can fit the data significantly better
than the convection model. We further find that for the reacceleration model,
the spectral hardenings of both the primary and secondary particles can be well
described by the injection hardening without including additional propagation
hardening. This is due to that the reacceleration effect results in a steeper
secondary-to-primary ratio at low energies, and can thus naturally reproduce
the fact that the secondary spectra harden more than the primary spectra found
by AMS-02.

are irreducible over $K$. In this paper we study the stability of trinomials
over finite fields. Specially, we show that if $f(x)$ is a trinomial of even
degree over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, then $f(x)$ is not stable. We
prove a similar result for some families of monic trinomials over finite fields
of odd characteristic. These results are obtained towards the resolution of a
conjecture on the instability of polynomials over finite fields whose degrees
are divisible by the characteristic of the underlying field.

  CNN-Based Orientation Classifier","Accepted in Medical Image Analysis",,"10.1016/j.media.2018.10.005",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronary artery centerline extraction in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) images
is a prerequisite for evaluation of stenoses and atherosclerotic plaque. We
propose an algorithm that extracts coronary artery centerlines in CCTA using a
convolutional neural network (CNN).
  A 3D dilated CNN is trained to predict the most likely direction and radius
of an artery at any given point in a CCTA image based on a local image patch.
Starting from a single seed point placed manually or automatically anywhere in
a coronary artery, a tracker follows the vessel centerline in two directions
using the predictions of the CNN. Tracking is terminated when no direction can
be identified with high certainty.
  The CNN was trained using 32 manually annotated centerlines in a training set
consisting of 8 CCTA images provided in the MICCAI 2008 Coronary Artery
Tracking Challenge (CAT08). Evaluation using 24 test images of the CAT08
challenge showed that extracted centerlines had an average overlap of 93.7%
with 96 manually annotated reference centerlines. Extracted centerline points
were highly accurate, with an average distance of 0.21 mm to reference
centerline points. In a second test set consisting of 50 CCTA scans, 5,448
markers in the coronary arteries were used as seed points to extract single
centerlines. This showed strong correspondence between extracted centerlines
and manually placed markers. In a third test set containing 36 CCTA scans,
fully automatic seeding and centerline extraction led to extraction of on
average 92% of clinically relevant coronary artery segments.
  The proposed method is able to accurately and efficiently determine the
direction and radius of coronary arteries. The method can be trained with
limited training data, and once trained allows fast automatic or interactive
extraction of coronary artery trees from CCTA images.

increasing focus on integrating more linguistic elements into Machine
Translation (MT). While significant progress has been achieved, especially
recently with neural models, automatically evaluating the output of such
systems is still an open problem. Current practice in MT evaluation relies on a
single reference translation, even though there are many ways of translating a
particular text, and it tends to disregard higher level information such as
discourse. We propose a novel approach that assesses the translated output
based on the source text rather than the reference translation, and measures
the extent to which the semantics of the discourse elements (discourse
relations, in particular) in the source text are preserved in the MT output.
The challenge is to detect the discourse relations in the source text and
determine whether these relations are correctly transferred crosslingually to
the target language -- without a reference translation. This methodology could
be used independently for discourse-level evaluation, or as a component in
other metrics, at a time where substantial amounts of MT are online and would
benefit from evaluation where the source text serves as a benchmark.

the success of these approaches strongly depends on population awareness and
the degree of engagement with disease control and prevention programs. In this
paper we derive and analyse a mathematical model of mosaic disease of {\it

depends on the level of population awareness. Two contributions to disease

awareness from observing infected plants. All steady states of the model are
found, and their stability is analysed in terms of system parameters. We
identify parameter regions associated with eradication of disease, stable
endemic infection, and periodic oscillations in the level of infection.
Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations that illustrate the

multiple symbol streams to multiple single-antenna users via precoding.
However, unlike conventional multiuser precoding, the transmitted signals are
subjected to binary, unit-modulus, or even discrete unit-modulus constraints.
Such constraints arise in the one-bit and constant-envelope (CE) massive MIMO
scenarios, wherein high-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are
replaced by one-bit DACs and phase shifters, respectively, for cutting down
hardware cost and energy consumption. Multiuser precoding under one-bit and CE
restrictions poses significant design difficulty. In this paper we establish a
framework for designing multiuser precoding under the one-bit, continuous CE
and discrete CE scenarios---all within one theme. We first formulate a
precoding design that focuses on minimizations of symbol-error probabilities
(SEPs), assuming quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. We then
devise an algorithm for our SEP-based design. The algorithm combines i) a novel
penalty method for handling binary, unit-modulus and discrete unit-modulus
constraints; and ii) a first-order non-convex optimization recipe custom-built
for the design. Specifically, the latter is an inexact
majorization-minimization method via accelerated projected gradient, which, as
shown by simulations, runs very fast and can handle a large number of decision
variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed design offers
significantly better bit-error rate performance than the existing designs.

electric and thermal conductance and thermopower as a function of gate voltage

motility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells can be described as a persistent random
walk with a persistence length that exceeds the mean pili length. Moreover, the
persistence length increases for a higher number of pili per cell. With the
help of a simple, tractable stochastic model, we test whether a tug-of-war

emerges naturally in the model, a tug-of-war alone is not capable of explaining
the motility of microcolonies, which becomes weaker with increasing colony

in the conventional expression for the holographic dark energy in a FLRW curved

By exploring the slowly varying condition for the $c^{2}$ term, we obtain a
range of validity for this holographic proposal. Under these considerations can
be found that this holographic cut-off is adequate to describe the late cosmic
evolution. Additionally, by considering some values constrained with the use of
observational data for some cosmological parameters in the context of dark
energy models, such as the deceleration parameter or the parameter state, can
be shown that this holographic model remains {\it close} to the $\Lambda$CDM

quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for
distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability. We have

decomposed to $7$ blocks of $(n-1)$-bit RBF, where $7$ is a constant

Critical to the development of this ideal laser source is the necessity for the

nonlinearity presents a powerful combination that enables the ability to lase

homogeneous nucleation occurs via random fluctuations within the supercooled
liquid, that the structure of the growing clusters resembles the most stable
bulk phase, and that the nucleus size is the sole reaction coordinate (RC) of
the process. Many materials are, however, known to exhibit multiple steps
during crystallization, forming different polymorphs. As a consequence, more
complex RCs are often required to capture all relevant information about the
process. In this work, we employ transition path sampling together with a
maximum likelihood analysis of candidate order parameters to identify suitable
reaction coordinates for the nucleation mechanism during solidification in Ni.
In contrast to CNT, the analysis of the reweighted path ensemble shows that a
pre-structured liquid region that surrounds the crystal cluster is a relevant
order parameter that enhances the RC and therefore plays a key role in the
description of the growing nucleus and the interfacial free energy. We
demonstrate that pre-structured liquid clusters that emerge within the liquid
act as precursors of the crystallization in a non-classical two-step mechanism
which predetermines the coordination of the polymorphs that are being selected.

employed in integrated optics are opening the path towards the implementation
of circuits with increasing degree of complexity. In addition to the more
conventional Application Specific Photonic Circuit (ASPIC) paradigm the
Programmable Multifunctional Nanophotonics (PMN) approach is a transversal
concept inspired by similar approaches, which are already employed in other
technology fields. For instance, in electronics Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) devices enable a much more flexible universal operation as compared to
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).In photonics, the (PMN)
concept is enabled by two dimensional (2D) waveguide meshes for which, the
number of possible input and output ports quickly builds up and furthermore,
internal signal flow paths make the computation of transfer functions an
intractable problem. Here we report a scalable method based on mathematical
induction that allows one to obtain the scattering matrix of any 2D integrated
photonic waveguide mesh circuit composed of an arbitrary number of cells and
which is easily programmable. To our knowledge this is the first report of the
kind and our results open the path to unblock this important design bottleneck.

  Spectroscopic Experiments","Title changed, references added. Enhanced and improved version. 12
  pages, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The explanation of the nature of superconducting gap in high temperature
superconductors (HTSC) is a fundamental task which solution can lead to the
understanding of superconducting mechanism. However, it has not been fully
solved yet. From the mid of the twentieth century when Bardeen, Cooper and
Schrieffer constructed their theory it has been believed that a superconducting
gap is a collective phenomenon of electron excitations. In this work it is
demonstrated that according to translation-invariant bipolaron theory of HTSC
the different types of experiments measure for the gap different values. Thus
tunneling experiments determine the bipolaron energy for a superconducting gap.
On the other hand, the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy method
measures the phonon frequency for which the electron-phonon interaction is
maximum. Such effects as kinks in spectral measurements of gap, its angular
dependence, existence of pseudogap and others have got natural explanations.

material surfaces in aqueous media are central to many technological, natural,
and geochemical processes. Cation adsorption/desorption is often proposed to
occur in concert with proton-transfer on hydroxyl-covered mineral surfaces, but
so far this cooperative effect has been inferred indirectly. This work applies
Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based molecular dynamics simulations of
explicit liquid water/mineral interfaces to calculate metal ion desorption free
energies. Monodentate adsorption of Na(+), Mg(2+), and Cu(2+) on partially
deprotonated silica surfaces are considered. Na(+) is predicted to be unbound,
while Cu(2+) exhibits larger binding free energies to surface SiO(-) groups
than Mg(2+). The predicted trends agree with competitive adsorption
measurements on fumed silica surfaces. As desorption proceeds, Cu(2+)
dissociates one of the H2O molecules in its first solvation shell, turning into
Cu(2+)O(-)(H2O)(3), while Mg remains Mg(2+)(H2O)(6). The protonation state of
the SiO(-) group at the initial binding site does not vary monotonically with
cation desorption.

synthetically-generated networks of human activity, in comparison with several
stylized network models as well as a collection of empirical networks from the
literature. The synthetic networks are generated by integrating data about
human populations from several sources, including the Census, transportation
surveys, and geographical data. The resulting networks represent an
approximation of daily or weekly human interaction. Our results indicate that
the synthetically generated graphs according to our methodology are closer to
the real world graphs, as measured across multiple structural measures, than a
range of stylized graphs generated using common network models from the
literature.
