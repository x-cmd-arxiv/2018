environment in terms of a spectral density function. This simplicity has led to
a variety of numerically exact quantum methods for reduced density matrix
propagation. When using these methods, a spectral density has to be computed
from dynamical properties of system and environment, which is commonly done
using classical molecular dynamics simulations. However, there are situations,
where quantum effects could play a role. Therefore, we reformulate our recently
developed Fourier method in order to enable spectral density calculations from
semiclassical simulations which approximately consider quantum effects. We
propose two possible protocols based on either correlation functions or
expectation values. These protocols are tested for the linearized semiclassical
initial-value representation (LSC-IVR), the thawed Gaussian wave packet
dynamics (TGWD) and hybrid schemes combining the two with the more accurate
Herman-Kluk (HK) formula. Surprisingly, spectral densities from the LSC-IVR
method, based on a completely classical propagation, are extremely accurate
whereas those from the single-trajectory TGWD are of poor quality in the
anharmonic regime. The hybrid methods provide reasonable quality when the
system is close to the classical regime, although, at finite temperature, the
computation protocol from expectation values turns out to be more robust. If
stronger quantum effects are observed, both hybrid methods turn out as too
inaccurate.

depth-based recognition methods can be trained on an uncountable number of
synthetically rendered images. However, discrepancies with the real data
acquired from various depth sensors still noticeably impede progress. Previous
works adopted unsupervised approaches to generate more realistic depth data,
but they all require real scans for training, even if unlabeled. This still
represents a strong requirement, especially when considering
real-life/industrial settings where real training images are hard or impossible
to acquire, but texture-less 3D models are available. We thus propose a novel
approach leveraging only CAD models to bridge the realism gap. Purely trained
on synthetic data, playing against an extensive augmentation pipeline in an
unsupervised manner, our generative adversarial network learns to effectively
segment depth images and recover the clean synthetic-looking depth information
even from partial occlusions. As our solution is not only fully decoupled from
the real domains but also from the task-specific analytics, the pre-processed
scans can be handed to any kind and number of recognition methods also trained
on synthetic data. Through various experiments, we demonstrate how this
simplifies their training and consistently enhances their performance, with
results on par with the same methods trained on real data, and better than
usual approaches doing the reverse mapping.

The strong deflection in the vicinity of atomic resonances is further used to

the correlation between multilinear forms and lower degree polynomials, and the
rank of tensors over $GF(2)= \{0,1\}$. We show the following results for
multilinear forms and tensors.
  1. Correlation bounds : We show that a random $d$-linear form has
exponentially low correlation with low-degree polynomials. More precisely, for
$d \ll 2^{o(k)}$, we show that a random $d$-linear form $f(X_1,X_2, \dots, X_d)
: \left(GF(2)^{k}\right)^d \rightarrow GF(2)$ has correlation $2^{-k(1-o(1))}$
with any polynomial of degree at most $d/10$. This result is proved by giving
near-optimal bounds on the bias of random $d$-linear form, which is in turn
proved by giving near-optimal bounds on the probability that a random rank-$t$
$d$-linear form is identically zero.
  2. Tensor-rank vs Bias : We show that if a $d$-dimensional tensor has small
rank, then the bias of the associated $d$-linear form is large. More precisely,
given any $d$-dimensional tensor $$T :\underbrace{[k]\times \ldots
[k]}_{\text{$d$ times}}\to GF(2)$$ of rank at most $t$, the bias of the
associated $d$-linear form $$f_T(X_1,\ldots,X_d) := \sum_{(i_1,\dots,i_d) \in
[k]^d} T(i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_d) X_{1,i_1}\cdot X_{1,i_2}\cdots X_{d,i_d}$$ is at
least $\left(1-\frac1{2^{d-1}}\right)^t$.
  The above bias vs tensor-rank connection suggests a natural approach to
proving nontrivial tensor-rank lower bounds for $d=3$. In particular, we use
this approach to prove that the finite field multiplication tensor has tensor
rank at least $3.52 k$ matching the best known lower bound for any explicit
tensor in three dimensions over $GF(2)$.

sufficient planar spin squeezing implies EPR steering, between the two groups

experiments, we show that the two-mode entanglement and EPR steering criteria
are predicted to be satisfied for realistic parameters. The reported
observation of spin squeezing in these parameter regimes suggests it is very
likely that the criteria can be used to infer an EPR steering between
mesoscopic groups of atoms, provided the total atom number can be determined to
sub-Poissonian uncertainty. The criteria also apply to a photonic Mach-Zehnder

Boolean functions are required for applications of quantum annealing or the
quantum approximate optimization algorithm to combinatorial optimization
problems. We show how such functions are naturally represented by Hamiltonians
given as sums of Pauli $Z$ operators (Ising spin operators) with the terms of
the sum corresponding to the function's Fourier expansion. For many classes of
functions which are given by a compact description, such as a Boolean formula
in conjunctive normal form that gives an instance of the satisfiability
problem, it is #P-hard to compute its Hamiltonian representation. On the other
hand, no such difficulty exists generally for constructing Hamiltonians
representing a real function such as a sum of local Boolean clauses. We give
composition rules for explicitly constructing Hamiltonians representing a wide
variety of Boolean and real functions by combining Hamiltonians representing
simpler clauses as building blocks. We apply our results to the construction of
controlled-unitary operators, and to the special case of operators that compute
function values in an ancilla qubit register. Finally, we outline several
additional applications and extensions of our results.
  A primary goal of this paper is to provide a $\textit{design toolkit for
quantum optimization}$ which may be utilized by experts and practitioners alike
in the construction and analysis of new quantum algorithms, and at the same
time to demystify the various constructions appearing in the literature.

also inspected: 5,000 random samples were drawn from two populations containing

including the most common options to correct rANOVA and MLM-results: The
Huynh-Feldt-correction for rANOVA (rANOVA-HF) and the Kenward-Roger-correction
for MLM (MLM-KR), which could help to correct progressive bias of MLM with an
unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN). Moreover, uncorrected rANOVA and MLM
assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure (MLM-CS) were also taken into

correction for Type I error via rANOVA-HF and an insufficient correction by

degraded availability, and has revenue ramifications. Detecting performance
degradation a posteriori helps the system take corrective action, but does not
avoid the QoS violations. Detecting QoS violations after the fact is even more
detrimental when a service consists of hundreds of thousands of loosely-coupled
microservices, since performance hiccups can quickly propagate across the
dependency graph of microservices. In this work we focus on anticipating QoS
violations in cloud settings to mitigate performance unpredictability to begin
with. We propose Seer, a cloud runtime that leverages the massive amount of
tracing data cloud systems collect over time and a set of practical learning
techniques to signal upcoming QoS violations, as well as identify the
microservice(s) causing them. Once an imminent QoS violation is detected Seer
uses machine-level hardware events to determine the cause of the QoS violation,
and adjusts the resource allocations to prevent it. In local clusters with 10
40-core servers and 200-instance clusters on GCE running diverse cloud
microservices, we show that Seer correctly anticipates QoS violations 91% of
the time, and attributes the violation to the correct microservice in 89% of
cases. Finally, Seer detects QoS violations early enough for a corrective
action to almost always be applied successfully.

  Prediction of Large-Scale Geostatistics Simulations",,,"10.1109/CLUSTER.2018.00089",,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximum likelihood estimation is an important statistical technique for
estimating missing data, for example in climate and environmental applications,
which are usually large and feature data points that are irregularly spaced. In
particular, the Gaussian log-likelihood function is the \emph{de facto} model,
which operates on the resulting sizable dense covariance matrix. The advent of
high performance systems with advanced computing power and memory capacity have
enabled full simulations only for rather small dimensional climate problems,
solved at the machine precision accuracy. The challenge for high dimensional
problems lies in the computation requirements of the log-likelihood function,
which necessitates ${\mathcal O}(n^2)$ storage and ${\mathcal O}(n^3)$
operations, where $n$ represents the number of given spatial locations. This
prohibitive computational cost may be reduced by using approximation techniques
that not only enable large-scale simulations otherwise intractable but also
maintain the accuracy and the fidelity of the spatial statistics model. In this
paper, we extend the Exascale GeoStatistics software framework (i.e.,
ExaGeoStat) to support the Tile Low-Rank (TLR) approximation technique, which
exploits the data sparsity of the dense covariance matrix by compressing the
off-diagonal tiles up to a user-defined accuracy threshold. The underlying
linear algebra operations may then be carried out on this data compression
format, which may ultimately reduce the arithmetic complexity of the maximum
likelihood estimation and the corresponding memory footprint. Performance
results of TLR-based computations on shared and distributed-memory systems
attain up to 13X and 5X speedups, respectively, compared to full accuracy
simulations using synthetic and real datasets (up to 2M), while ensuring
adequate prediction accuracy.

classical machine learning: a generator tries to create statistics for data
that mimics those of a true data set, while a discriminator tries to
discriminate between the true and fake data. The learning process for generator
and discriminator can be thought of as an adversarial game, and under
reasonable assumptions, the game converges to the point where the generator
generates the same statistics as the true data and the discriminator is unable

the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks (QuGANs), where the data
consists either of quantum states, or of classical data, and the generator and

the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the

perturbative series can be extended to a transseries including nonperturbative
terms. The latter converges to the exact result well beyond the range of
validity of perturbation theory. The crucial role of the divergences induced by
shell-crossing is discussed. They provide constraints on the structure of the
transseries and act as a bridge between the perturbative and the
nonperturbative sectors. Then, we show that the dynamics in the deep
multistreaming regime is governed by attractors. In the case of simple initial
conditions, these attractors coincide with the asymptotic configurations of the
adhesion model, but in general they may differ. These results are applied to a
cosmological setting, and an algorithm to build the attractor solution starting

Mechanics (QM) and quantum measurement [1-6]. It is shown that the standard and
quantum relative entropies are tools designed for the purpose of updating
probability distributions and density matrices, respectively [1]. The
derivation of the standard and quantum relative entropies are completed in
tandem and follow from the same inferential principle - the principle of
minimal updating [21,66]. As the quantum maximum entropy method is derived
using the standard quantum mechanical formalism, the quantum maximum entropy
method may be appended to the standard quantum mechanical formalism and remove
collapse as a required postulate, in agreement with [11]. The quantum maximum
entropy method is found to be a ""universal method of density matrix inference""
as it can process information about data and moments simultaneously (giving
joint generalized quantum inference solutions), which when processed separately
gives the Quantum Bayes Rule [2,39] or a canonical quantum (von Neumann)
maximum entropy solution [10], respectively, as special cases.
  The second part of this thesis revolves around a foundational theory of QM
called Entropic Dynamics (ED) [13]. Rather than appending an interpretation to
QM, ED states its interpretation, ""that particles have definite, yet unknown,
positions and that entropic probability updating works"" - only then does ED
derive QM as an application of inference consistent with these assumptions.
This shift in interpretation allows one to solve the quantum measurement
problem [3,14] and avoid being ruled out by quantum no-go theorems [4].
Observables are divvied-up into two classes in ED: they are the ontic ""beables""
[15] (particle position), and the epistemic ""inferables"" [3], which are not
predisposed to be part of the ontology as they are inferred in general from
position detections.

to analyze how price impact affects optimal policies, as well as both pricing
rules and demand schedules for contingent claims. For exponential market makers
preferences, we establish two effects due to price impact: constrained trading,
and non-linear hedging costs. To the former, wealth processes in the impact
model are identified with those in a model without impact, but with constrained
trading, where the (random) constraint set is generically neither closed nor
convex. Regarding hedging, non-linear hedging costs motivate the study of
arbitrage free prices for the claim. We provide three such notions, which
coincide in the frictionless case, but which dramatically differ in the
presence of price impact. Additionally, we show arbitrage opportunities, should
they arise from claim prices, can be exploited only for limited position sizes,
and may be ignored if outweighed by hedging considerations. We also show that
arbitrage inducing prices may arise endogenously in equilibrium, and that
equilibrium positions are inversely proportional to the market makers'
representative risk aversion. Therefore, large positions endogenously arise in
the limit of either market maker risk neutrality, or a large number of market
makers.

functions layered over the surface. Given an initial set of seeds or regions,
the partition emerges as the solution of a time dependent set of partial
differential equations describing concurrently evolving fronts on the surface.
Our solution does not require geodesic estimation, elaborate numerical solvers,
or complicated bookkeeping data structures. The cost per time-iteration is
dominated by the multiplication and addition of two sparse matrices. Extension
of our approach in a Lloyd's algorithm fashion can be easily achieved and the
extraction of the dual mesh can be conveniently preformed in parallel through
matrix algebra. As our approach relies mainly on basic linear algebra kernels,
it lends itself to efficient implementation on modern graphics hardware.

the agents, although they have an underlying true strict linear order, are
allowed to specify partial orders. Specifically, we focus on the case where the
agents are allowed to submit strict weak orders and we try to address the
following questions from the perspective of a market-designer: i) How can a
designer generate matchings that are robust? ii) What is the trade-off between
the amount of missing information and the ""quality"" of solution one can get?
With the goal of resolving these questions through a simple and prior-free
approach, we suggest looking at matchings that minimize the maximum number of
blocking pairs with respect to all the possible underlying true orders as a
measure of ""quality"", and subsequently provide results on finding such
matchings.
  In particular, we first restrict our attention to matchings that have to be
stable with respect to at least one of the completions and show that in this
case arbitrarily filling-in the missing information and computing the resulting
stable matching can give a non-trivial approximation factor for our problem in
certain cases. We complement this result by showing that, even under severe
restrictions on the preferences of the agents, the factor obtained is
asymptotically tight in many cases. We then investigate a special case, where
only agents on one side provide strict weak orders and all the missing
information is at the bottom of their preference orders, and show that here the
negative result mentioned above can be circumvented in order to get a much
better approximation factor; this result, too, is tight in many cases. Finally,
we move away from the restriction mentioned above and show a general hardness
of approximation result and also discuss one possible approach that can lead us
to a near-tight approximation bound.

show that this pre-processing step has to compose its cycle avoidance condition

propose several techniques by which the number of cycles is exponentially
increased with respect to the number of inserted feedbacks. We further
illustrate that when the number of feedbacks is increased, the pre-processing
step of CycSAT faces an exponential increase in complexity and runtime,
preventing the correct composition of loop avoidance clauses in a reasonable
time before invoking the SAT solver. On the other hand, if the pre-processing
is not completed properly, the SAT solver will get stuck or return incorrect

complexity with respect to the number of inserted feedback, even when the

functions or dynamic structure factors of translation-invariant systems, the
response for some range $|x-y|<\ell$ is needed. We demonstrate how the number
of required time-evolution runs can be reduced substantially: (a) If
finite-system simulations are employed, the number of time-evolution runs can
be reduced from $\ell$ to $2\sqrt{\ell}$. (b) To go beyond, one can employ
infinite MPS (iMPS) such that two evolution runs suffice. To this purpose, iMPS
that are heterogeneous only around the causal cone of the perturbation are
evolved in time, i.e., the simulation is done with infinite boundary
conditions. Computing overlaps of these states, spatially shifted relative to
each other, yields the response functions for all distances $|x-y|$. As a
specific application, we compute the dynamic structure factor for ground states
of bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chains with very high resolution and explain the
underlying low-energy physics. To determine the initial uniform iMPS for such
simulations, infinite-system density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) can
be employed. We discuss that, depending on the system and chosen bond

which physical processes leave a clear imprint and may therefore be constrained
observationally and (3) provide a suite of publicly available model
predictions. We find that $22_{-8}^{+26}$% of all massive binary systems merge
prior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder,
$86_{-9}^{+11}$% become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this
rarely produce runaway stars (i.e., stars with velocities above 30 km/s). These
are outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by slower unbound
companions, or ""walkaway stars"". This is a robust outcome of our simulations
and is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and
widening of the orbit, as we show analytically and numerically. We estimate a
$10^{+5}_{-8}$% of massive stars to be walkaways and only $0.5^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$%
to be runaways, nearly all of which have accreted mass from their companion.
Our findings are consistent with earlier studies, however the low runaway
fraction we find is in tension with observed fractions 10%. If Gaia confirms
these high fractions of massive runaway stars resulting from binaries, it would
imply that we are currently missing physics in the binary models. Finally, we
show that high end of the mass distributions of runaway stars is very sensitive
to the assumed black hole natal kicks and propose this as a potentially
stringent test for the explosion mechanism. We discuss companions remaining
bound which can evolve into X-ray and gravitational wave sources.

simplest version L\'evy walks move with a finite speed. Here, we present an
extension of the L\'evy walk scenario for the case when external force fields
influence the motion. The resulting motion is a combination of the response to
the deterministic force acting on the particle, changing its velocity according
to the principle of total energy conservation, and random velocity reversals
governed by the distribution of waiting times. For the fact that the motion
stays conservative, that is, on a constant energy surface, our scenario is
fundamentally different from thermal motion in the same external potentials. In
particular, we present results for the velocity and position distributions for
single well potentials of different steepness. The observed dynamics with its

underlying Poisson algebra leads to a noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory which
arguably describes a quantized K\""ahler geometry. The Hilbert space
representation of quantized K\""ahler geometry eventually ends in a
zero-dimensional matrix model. We then play with the zero-dimensional matrix
model to examine how to recover our starting point--K\""ahler geometry--from the
background-independent formulation. The round-trip journey suggests many
remarkable pictures for quantum gravity that will open a new perspective to
resolve the notorious problems in theoretical physics such as the cosmological
constant problem, hierarchy problem, dark energy, dark matter and cosmic
inflation. We also discuss how time emerges to generate a Lorentzian spacetime
in the context of emergent gravity.

during its 2017 outburst using {\it Swift} and RATIR. The source was found to
be $\gtrsim$4.4 mag above its quiescent level during the peak of the outburst

a superoutburst of a long orbital period U Geminorum type dwarf nova system.
The spectral energy distribution during the initial slow decay phase of the
outburst was consistent with a disk-dominated spectra (having spectral indices
$\Gamma \! \sim$1.5--2.3). After this phase, the UV flux decreased slower than
the optical and the spectral energy distribution was very steep with indices
$\Gamma \! \sim$3.7$\pm$0.7. This slow decay in the UV may be the emission from
a cooling white dwarf heated during the outburst. The spectral shape determined
from the assumed pre-outburst quiescent level was also steep ($\Gamma \!
\gtrsim$2.5) indicating that the white dwarf is still hot in quiescence (even
after the cooling due to the potential accretion-induced heating has halted).
No X-ray emission was detected from the source since it is likely located at a
large distance $>$2.3 kpc.

the HI lies within dark matter halos and quantify the average HI mass hosted by
halos of mass M at redshift z. We find that only halos with circular velocities
larger than $\simeq$ 30 km/s contain HI. While the density profiles of HI
exhibit a large halo-to-halo scatter, the mean profiles are universal across
mass and redshift. The HI in low-mass halos is mostly located in the central
galaxy, while in massive halos is concentrated in the satellites. We show that
the HI and matter density probability distribution functions differ
significantly. Our results point out that for small halos the HI bulk velocity
goes in the same direction and has the same magnitude as the halo peculiar
velocity, while in large halos differences show up. We find that halo HI
velocity dispersion follows a power-law with halo mass. We find a complicated
HI bias, with HI becoming non-linear already at $k=0.3$ h/Mpc at $z\gtrsim3$.
Our simulation reproduces the DLAs bias value from observations. We find that
the clustering of HI can be accurately reproduced by perturbative methods. We
identify a new secondary bias, by showing that the clustering of halos depends
not only on mass but also on HI content. We compute the amplitude of the HI
shot-noise and find that it is small at all redshifts. We study the clustering
of HI in redshift-space, and show that linear theory can explain the ratio
between the monopoles in redshift- and real-space down to small scales at high
redshift. We find that the amplitude of the Fingers-of-God effect is larger for
HI than for matter. We point out that accurate 21 cm maps can be created from
N-body or approximate simulations rather than full hydrodynamic simulations.

to derive chaotic many-body dynamics from ad hoc kinetic equations. A period of
exponential growth in the total gross exchange determines the Lyapunov exponent

propagating into an unstable state in phase space. As in conventional Boltzmann
transport, which follows from the dynamics of the net particle number density
exchange, the kernel of this kinetic integral equation is also set by the

photometric and spectroscopic surveys must take this into account. We have
developed a model to predict how binaries influence the scientific results
inferred from large spectroscopic surveys. Based on the rapid binary evolution
code BSE, it allows us to model a representative population of binaries and
generate synthetic survey observations. We describe this model in detail, and
apply it to the radial velocity variation of subgiant and giant stars in the
Galactic disc, as observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. APOGEE provides
an excellent data set for testing our binary models since a large fraction of
the stars have been observed multiple times.
  By comparing our model to the APOGEE observations we constrain the initial
binary fraction of solar-metallicity stars in the sample to be $f_{\rm
b,0}=0.35\pm0.01$, in line with the solar neighbourhood. We find that the
binary fraction is higher at lower metallicities, consistent with other
observational studies. Our model matches the shape of the high-velocity scatter
in APOGEE, which suggests that most velocity variability above 0.5 km/s comes
from binaries. Our exploration of binary initial properties shows that APOGEE
is mostly sensitive to binaries with periods between 3 and 3000 years, and is
largely insensitive to the detailed properties of the population. We can,
however, rule out a population where the mass of the lower-mass star is drawn
from the IMF independently of its companion.

surrounding RW Aur A and B is incompatible with a single star--disk tidal

with CO radii of 58 au and 38 au consistent with tidal truncation, and 2.5

However,
despite the cultural and economic importance of fame and its gradations, there
exists no consensus method for quantifying the fame of an individual, or of
comparing that of two individuals. We argue that, even if fame is difficult to
measure with precision, one may develop useful metrics for fame that correlate
well with intuition and that remain reasonably stable over time. Using datasets
of recently deceased individuals who were highly renowned, we have evaluated
several internet-based methods for quantifying fame. We find that some
widely-used internet-derived metrics, such as search engine results, correlate
poorly with human subject judgments of fame. However other metrics exist that
agree well with human judgments and appear to offer workable, easily accessible
measures of fame. Using such a metric we perform a preliminary investigation of
the statistical distribution of fame, which has some of the power law character
seen in other natural and social phenomena such as landslides and market
crashes. In order to demonstrate how such findings can generate quantitative
insight into celebrity culture, we assess some folk ideas regarding the
frequency distribution and apparent clustering of celebrity deaths.

coexisting within $\sim 1000$ au. In our models, three of these compact sources
are better represented as disc-envelope systems around a central (proto)star,
two as envelopes with a central object, and one as a pure envelope. The model
of the most prominent object (Main) contains the most massive (proto)star
($M_\star\approx7~M_\odot$) and disc+envelope
($M_\mathrm{gas}\approx0.4~M_\odot$), and is the most luminous
($L_\mathrm{Main} \sim 10^4~L_\odot$). The model discs are small (a few hundred
au) for all sources. The composite model shows that the elongated spiral-like
feature converging to the MM1 core can be convincingly interpreted as a
filamentary accretion flow that feeds the rising stellar system. The kinematics
of this filament is reproduced by a parabolic trajectory with focus at the
center of mass of the region. Radial collapse and fragmentation within this
filament, as well as smaller filamentary flows between pairs of sources are
proposed to exist. Our modelling supports an interpretation where what was once
considered as a single massive star with a $\sim 10^3$ au disc and envelope, is
instead a forming stellar association which appears to be virialized and to
form several low-mass stars per high-mass object.

differences between the two sources, the isotopic ratios, and the spatial
extent derived from molecules containing the nitrile functional group. Using
data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) obtained with
ALMA we determine abundances and excitation temperatures for the detected
nitriles. We also present a new method for determining the spatial structure of
sources with high line density and large velocity gradients $-$
Velocity-corrected INtegrated emission (VINE) maps. We detect methyl cyanide
(CH$_3$CN) as well as 5 of its isotopologues, including the detection of
CHD$_2$CN which is the first detection in the ISM. We also detect ethyl cyanide
(C$_2$H$_5$CN), vinyl cyanide (C$_2$H$_3$CN), and cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N). We
find that abundances are similar between IRAS 16293A and IRAS 16293B on small
scales except for vinyl cyanide which is only detected towards the latter
source. This suggests an important difference between the sources either in
their evolutionary stage or warm-up timescales. We also detect a spatially
double-peaked emission for the first time in molecular emission in the A
source, suggesting that this source is showing structure related to a rotating
toroid of material.

addition to the dynamical metric. The six-parameter theory we consider was
found to be consistent around arbitrary torsionless Einstein backgrounds, in
spite of its containing a (notoriously delicate) massive spin-2 excitation. At
zero bare cosmological constant, this theory was found to admit a
self-accelerating solution whose exponential expansion is sustained by a
non-zero torsion background. The scalar-type perturbations of the latter
torsionfull self-accelerating solution were recently studied and were found to
preserve the number of propagating scalar degrees of freedom, but to exhibit,
for some values of the torsion background some exponential instabilities (of a
rather mild type). Here, we study the tensor-type and vector-type perturbations
of the torsionfull self-accelerating solution, and of its deformation by a
non-zero bare cosmological constant. We find strong, ""gradient"" instabilities
in the vector sector. No tuning of the parameters of the theory can kill these
instabilities without creating instabilities in the other sectors. Further work
is needed to see whether generic torsionfull backgrounds are prone to
containing gradient instabilities, or if the instabilities we found are mainly
due to the (generalized) self-accelerating nature of the special de Sitter
backgrounds we considered.

Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the traffic rates and detecting
anomalous changes in the network. The probabilistic nature of the model allows
us to perform statistical goodness-of-fit tests to detect significant
deviations from a baseline network. We show that due to the more defined

the empirical models estimated by the EM algorithm are misspecified. We apply
our model to both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate its superior

the (high-dimensional) input data are fully observed. However, in several
practical applications (such as hyper-spectral imaging or blood glucose

For incomplete settings, no provably correct and polynomial-time algorithm has
been reported in the dictionary learning literature. In this paper, we provide
provable approaches for learning - from incomplete samples - a family of
dictionaries whose atoms have sufficiently ""spread-out"" mass. First, we propose
a descent-style iterative algorithm that linearly converges to the true
dictionary when provided a sufficiently coarse initial estimate. Second, we
propose an initialization algorithm that utilizes a small number of extra fully
observed samples to produce such a coarse initial estimate. Finally, we
theoretically analyze their performance and provide asymptotic statistical and
computational guarantees.

(TMDCs) such as MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ possess many similar
electronic properties. As it is the case for all semiconductors, however, the
physical response of these systems is strongly determined by defects in a way
specific to each individual compound. Here we investigate the ability of
exfoliated monolayers of these TMDCs to support high-quality, well-balanced
ambipolar conduction, which has been demonstrated for WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and
WSe$_2$, but not for MoS$_2$. Using ionic-liquid gated transistors we show
that, contrary to WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$, hole transport in exfoliated
MoS$_2$ monolayers is systematically anomalous, exhibiting a maximum in
conductivity at negative gate voltage (V$_G$) followed by a suppression of up
to 100 times upon further increasing V$_G$. To understand the origin of this
difference we have performed a series of experiments including the comparison
of hole transport in MoS$_2$ monolayers and thicker multilayers, in exfoliated
and CVD-grown monolayers, as well as gate-dependent optical measurements (Raman
and photoluminescence) and scanning tunneling imaging and spectroscopy. In
agreement with existing {\it ab-initio} calculations, the results of all these
experiments are consistently explained in terms of defects associated to

  Representation from Imbalanced Data",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Imbalanced data widely exists in many high-impact applications. An example is
in air traffic control, where we aim to identify the leading indicators for
each type of accident cause from historical records. Among all three types of
accident causes, historical records with 'personnel issues' are much more than
the other two types ('aircraft issues' and 'environmental issues') combined.
Thus, the resulting dataset is highly imbalanced, and can be naturally modeled
as a network. Up until now, most existing work on imbalanced data analysis
focused on the classification setting, and very little is devoted to learning
the node representation from imbalanced networks. To address this problem, in
this paper, we propose Vertex-Diminished Random Walk (VDRW) for imbalanced
network analysis. The key idea is to encourage the random particle to walk
within the same class by adjusting the transition probabilities each step. It
resembles the existing Vertex Reinforced Random Walk in terms of the dynamic
nature of the transition probabilities, as well as some convergence properties.
However, it is more suitable for analyzing imbalanced networks as it leads to
more separable node representations in the embedding space. Then, based on
VDRW, we propose a semi-supervised network representation learning framework
named ImVerde for imbalanced networks, in which context sampling uses VDRW and
the label information to create node-context pairs, and balanced-batch sampling
adopts a simple under-sampling method to balance these pairs in different
classes. Experimental results demonstrate that ImVerde based on VDRW
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for learning network representation
from imbalanced data.

  Using the $H^\infty$-version of the $S$-functional calculus we have recently
defined fractional powers of quaternionic operators, which contain, as a
particular case, the vector operator $T$. Hence, we can define the non-local
version $T^\alpha$, for $\alpha\in (0,1)$, of the Fourier law defined by $T$.
We will see in this paper how we have to interpret $T^\alpha$, when we

fractional diffusion and fractional evolution problems that can be defined and
studied using our spectral theory based on the $S$-spectrum for vector
operators.
  This paper is devoted to researchers working in fractional diffusion and

minimizers.
  Based on this, we investigate two microscopic binary mixture formulations
fully resolving heterogeneous/perforated domains: (a) a flux-driven immiscible
fluid formulation without fluid flow; (b) a momentum-driven formulation for
quasi-static and incompressible velocity fields. In both cases we state two
novel, reliably upscaled equations for binary mixtures/multiphase fluids in
strongly heterogeneous systems by systematically taking thermodynamic features
such as free energies into account as well as the system's heterogeneity
defined on the microscale such as geometry and materials (e.g. wetting
properties). In the context of (a), we unravel a \emph{universality} with
respect to the coarsening rate due to its independence of the system's
heterogeneity, i.e. the well-known ${\cal O}(t^{1/3})$-behaviour for
homogeneous systems holds also for perforated domains.
  Finally, the versatility of phase field equations and their
\emph{thermodynamic foundation} relying on free energies, make the collected
recent developments here highly promising for scientific, engineering and

Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. The
high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters, termed 'protoclusters', are
identified in cosmological simulations with the highest dark matter
overdensities. While their observational signatures are less well defined
compared to virialized clusters with a substantial hot intra-cluster medium
(ICM), protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that
can be observed as luminous starbursts. Recent claimed detections of
protoclusters hosting such starbursts do not support the kind of rapid cluster
core formation expected in simulations because these structures contain only a
handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad structure, with poor
evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report that the
source SPT2349-56 consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies all lying at z =
4.31 based on sensitive observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon. We
demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1000
times faster than our own Milky Way, and all are located within a projected
region only $\sim$ 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is
more than 10 times the average blank field value (integrated over all
redshifts) and $>$1000 times the average field volume density. The velocity
dispersion ($\sim$ 410 km s$^{-1}$) of these galaxies and enormous gas and star
formation densities suggest that this system represents a galaxy cluster core
at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years
old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that
SPT2349-56 is a uniquely massive and dense system that could be building one of

valuable information for probabilistic forecasting which aims at producing a

single best guess estimate. Unfortunately, ensembles cannot generally be
considered as a sample from such a predictive probability distribution without
a preliminary post-processing treatment to calibrate the ensemble. Two main
families of post-processing methods, either competing such as BMA or
collaborative such as EMOS, can be found in the literature. This paper proposes
a mixed effect model belonging to the collaborative family. The structure of
the model is based on the hypothesis of invariance under the relabelling of the
ensemble members. Its interesting specificities are as follows: 1)
exchangeability, which contributes to parsimony, with a latent pivot variable
synthesizing the essential meteorological features of the ensembles, 2) a
multi-ensemble implementation, allowing to take advantage of various
information so as to increase the sharpness of the forecasting procedure. Focus
is cast onto Normal statistical structures, first with a direct application for
temperatures, then with its Tobit extension for precipitation. Inference is
performed by EM algorithms with recourse made to stochastic conditional
simulations in the precipitation case. After checking its good behavior on
artificial data, the proposed post-processing technique is applied to
temperature and precipitation ensemble forecasts produced over five river

the point of view of graph theory and walks on lattices. By virtue of the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem for characteristic polynomials and the
Coulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem for alternant hydrocarbons, it is possible
to derive a finite series expansion of the Green's function for electron
transmission in terms of the odd powers of the vertex adjacency matrix or
H{\""u}ckel matrix. This means that only odd-length walks on a molecular graph
contribute to the conductivity through a molecule. Thus, if there are only
even-length walks between two atoms, quantum interference is expected to occur
in the electron transport between them. However, even if there are only
odd-length walks between two atoms, a situation may come about where the
contributions to the QI of some odd-length walks are canceled by others,
leading to another class of quantum interference. For non-alternant
hydrocarbons, the finite Green's function expansion may include both even and
odd powers. Nevertheless, QI can in some circumstances come about for
non-alternants, from the cancellation of odd and even-length walk terms. We
report some progress, but not a complete resolution of the problem of
understanding the coefficients in the expansion of the Green's function in a
power series of the adjacency matrix, these coefficients being behind the
cancellations that we have mentioned. And we introduce a perturbation theory

expansions of the Green's function.

domain in transfer learning, we freeze the trained encoder and fine-tune a
neural net on the target domain. We train on the Something-Something dataset
with over 220, 000 videos, and multiple levels of target granularity, including
50 action groups, 174 fine-grained action categories and captions.
Classification and captioning with Something-Something are challenging because
of the subtle differences between actions, applied to thousands of different
object classes, and the diversity of captions penned by crowd actors. Our model
performs better than existing classification baselines for SomethingSomething,
with impressive fine-grained results. And it yields a strong baseline on the
new Something-Something captioning task. Experiments reveal that training with
more fine-grained tasks tends to produce better features for transfer learning.

features and classify the contents of dynamic scenes from the temporal output
of a neuromorphic asynchronous event-based camera. Event-based cameras are
clock-less sensors where each pixel asynchronously reports intensity changes
encoded in time at the microsecond precision. While this technology is gaining
more attention, there is still a lack of methodology and understanding of their
temporal properties. This paper introduces an unsupervised time-oriented
event-based machine learning algorithm building on the concept of hierarchy of
temporal descriptors called time surfaces. In this work we show that the use of
sparse coding allows for a very compact yet efficient time-based machine
learning that lowers both the computational cost and memory need. We show that
we can represent visual scene temporal dynamics with a finite set of elementary
time surfaces while providing similar recognition rates as an uncompressed
version by storing the most representative time surfaces using clustering
techniques. Experiments will illustrate the main optimizations and trade-offs
to consider when implementing the method for online continuous vs. offline
learning. We report results on the same previously published 36 class character
recognition task and a 4 class canonical dynamic card pip task, achieving 100%
accuracy on each.

function of time. We use standard radio-astronomical observations that have
artificial periodic and non-periodic signals generated by the electronics of
terrestrial origin. The autocorrelation detects weak signals that have small
amplitudes because it averages over long integration times. Another advantage
is that it allows a direct visualization of the shape of the signals, while it
is difficult to see the shape with a Fourier transform. Although Fourier
transforms can also detect periodic signals, a novelty of this work is that we
demonstrate another major advantage of the autocorrelation, that it can detect
non-periodic signals while the Fourier transform cannot. Another major novelty
of our work is that we use electric fields taken in a standard format with
standard instrumentation at a radio observatory and therefore no specialized
instrumentation is needed. Because the electric fields are sampled every 15.625
nanoseconds, they therefore allow detection of very rapid time variations.
Notwithstanding the long integration times, the autocorrelation detects very
rapid intensity variations as a function of time. The autocorrelation could
also detect messages from Extraterrestrial Intelligence as non-periodic

oil-film interferometry (OFI) measurements are assessed. Both statistical and
classical methods are used for the forward and inverse problems, so that the
contributions to the overall uncertainty of the measured quantities can be
evaluated. The correlations between the parameters are taken into account
through the Bayesian inference with error-in-variable (EiV) model. In the
forward problem, very small differences were found when using Monte Carlo (MC),
Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and linear perturbation methods. In flow
velocity measurements with HWA, the results indicate that the estimated
uncertainty is lower when the correlations among parameters are considered,
than when they are not taken into account. Moreover, global sensitivity
analyses with Sobol indices showed that the HWA measurements are most sensitive
to the wire voltage, and in the case of OFI the most sensitive factor is the
calculation of fringe velocity. The relative errors in wall-shear stress,
friction velocity and viscous length are 0.44%, 0.23% and 0.22%, respectively.
Note that these values are lower than the ones reported in other wall-bounded
turbulence studies. Note that in most studies of wall-bounded turbulence the
correlations among parameters are not considered, and the uncertainties from
the various parameters are directly added when determining the overall
uncertainty of the measured quantity. In the present analysis we account for
these correlations, which may lead to a lower overall uncertainty estimate due
to error cancellation. Furthermore, our results also indicate that the crucial
aspect when obtaining accurate inner-scaled velocity measurements is the
wind-tunnel flow quality, which is more critical than the accuracy in
wall-shear stress measurements.

recently-developed energy optimization method for identifying the minimal
disturbance necessary to reach the basin boundary of a stable state is
connected to the instanton trajectory from large deviation theory of noisy
systems. In the context of the one-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation which
has multiple stable equilibria, we first show how the energy optimization
method can be straightforwardly used to identify minimal disturbances --
minimal seeds -- for transition to specific attractors from the ground state.
Then, after generalising the technique to consider multiple,
equally-spaced-in-time perturbations, it is shown that the instanton trajectory

the instanton can be captured by a low number of discrete perturbations

promising new diagnostic for systems for which it may be impractical to

an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in
large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability
delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust
identity based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes
advantage of smart contract for registering, propagation and revocation of the
access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their
own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a

are doped into the parent Mott insulator. This well-established fact has,
however, eluded a microscopic explanation. Here we show that the missing link
is the self-energy pole in the energy-momentum space. Its continuous evolution
with doping directly connects the Mott insulator and high-temperature
superconductivity. We show this by numerically studying the extremely small
doping region close to the Mott insulating phase in a standard model for
cuprates, the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We first identify two relevant
self-energy structures in the Mott insulator; the pole generating the Mott gap
and a relatively broad peak generating the so-called waterfall structure, which
is another consequence of strong correlations present in the Mott insulator. We
next reveal that either the Mott-gap pole or the waterfall structure (the
feature at the energy closer to the Fermi level) directly transforms itself
into another self-energy pole at the same energy and momentum when the system
is doped with carriers. The anomalous self-energy yielding the
superconductivity is simultaneously born exactly at this energy-momentum point.
Thus created self-energy pole, interpreted as arising from a hidden fermionic
excitation, continuously evolves upon further doping and considerably enhances
the superconductivity. Above the critical temperature, the same self-energy
pole generates a pseudogap in the normal state. We thus elucidate a unified
Mott-physics mechanism, where the self-energy structure inherent to the Mott
insulator directly gives birth to both the high-temperature superconductivity

the unique properties of graphene. For example, hydrogenation can yield a
variety of interesting effects, including a metal-insulator transition or the
formation of localized magnetic moments. Meanwhile, graphene grown by chemical
vapor deposition is the most suitable for large-scale production, but the
resulting material tends to be polycrystalline. Up to now there has been
relatively little focus on how chemical functionalization, and hydrogenation in
particular, impacts the properties of polycrystalline graphene. In this work,
we use numerical simulations to study the electrical properties of hydrogenated
polycrystalline graphene. We find a strong correlation between the spatial
distribution of the hydrogen adsorbates and the charge transport properties.
Charge transport is weakly sensitive to hydrogenation when adsorbates are
confined to the grain boundaries, while a uniform distribution of hydrogen
degrades the electronic mobility. This difference stems from the formation of
the hydrogen-induced resonant impurity states, which are inhibited when the
honeycomb symmetry is locally broken by the grain boundaries. These findings
suggest a tunability of electrical transport of polycrystalline graphene
through selective hydrogen functionalization, and also have implications for
hydrogen-induced magnetization and spin lifetime of this material.

mainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic
system based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital
role. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of
economic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable
factors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of
economic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in
the past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those
novel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has
shown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school,
under this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner
where the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and
adaptive. According to it, the economic aggregates emerge out of the ways
agents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs,
Agent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians
and practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and
local interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex

Opsomer","Estimation and inference of domain means subject to shape constraints",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Population domain means are frequently expected to respect shape or order
constraints that arise naturally with survey data. For example, given a job
category, mean salaries in big cities might be expected to be higher than those
in small cities, but no order might be available to be imposed within big or
small cities. A design-based estimator of domain means that imposes constraints
on the most common survey estimators is proposed. Inequality restrictions that
can be expressed with irreducible matrices are considered, as these cover a
broad class of shapes and partial orderings. The constrained estimator is shown
to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under mild conditions,
given that the shape is a reasonable assumption for the population. Further,
simulation experiments demonstrate that both estimation and variability of
domain means are improved by the constrained estimator in comparison with usual
unconstrained estimators, especially for small domains. An application of the
proposed estimator to the 2015 U.S. National Survey of College Graduates is
shown.

problem for a variety of applications. Recently, the development of weak
labeling approaches for audio or sound event detection (AED) and availability
of large scale weakly labeled dataset have finally opened up the possibility of
large scale AED. However, a deeper understanding of how weak labels affect the
learning for sound events is still missing from literature. In this work, we
first describe a CNN based approach for weakly supervised training of audio
events. The approach follows some basic design principle desirable in a
learning method relying on weakly labeled audio. We then describe important
characteristics, which naturally arise in weakly supervised learning of sound
events. We show how these aspects of weak labels affect the generalization of
models. More specifically, we study how characteristics such as label density
and corruption of labels affects weakly supervised training for audio events.
We also study the feasibility of directly obtaining weak labeled data from the
web without any manual label and compare it with a dataset which has been
manually labeled. The analysis and understanding of these factors should be
taken into picture in the development of future weak label learning methods.
Audioset, a large scale weakly labeled dataset for sound events is used in our
experiments.

observations were performed with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at
4.8\,GHz, focusing on the statistical properties of IDV in a relatively large
sample of compact active galactic nuclei (AGN). We investigated the dependence
of rapid ($<$3 day) variability on various source properties through a
likelihood approach. We found that the IDV amplitude depends on flux density
and that fainter sources vary by about a factor of 3 more than their brighter
counterparts. We also found a significant difference in the variability
amplitude between inverted- and flat-spectrum radio sources, with the former
exhibiting stronger variations. $\gamma$-ray loud sources were found to vary by
up to a factor 4 more than $\gamma$-ray quiet ones, with 4$\sigma$
significance. However a galactic latitude dependence was barely observed, which
suggests that it is predominantly the intrinsic properties (e.g., angular size,
core-dominance) of the blazars that determine how they scintillate, rather than
the directional dependence in the interstellar medium (ISM). We showed that the
uncertainty in the VLBI brightness temperatures obtained from the space VLBI
data of the RadioAstron satellite can be as high as $\sim$70\% due to the
presence of the rapid flux density variations. Our statistical results support
the view that IDV at centimeter wavelengths is predominantly caused by
interstellar scintillation (ISS) of the emission from the most compact,
core-dominant region in an AGN.

coding techniques to remove spatial and temporal redundancy. However, efficient
exploitation of statistical dependencies measured by a mean squared error (MSE)
does not always produce the best psychovisual result. One interesting approach
is to only encode visually relevant information and use a different coding
method for ""perceptually insignificant"" regions in the frame, which can lead to
substantial data rate reductions while maintaining visual quality. In this
paper, we introduce a texture analyzer before encoding the input sequences to
identify detail irrelevant texture regions in the frame using convolutional
neural networks. We designed and developed a new coding tool referred to as
texture mode for AV1, where if texture mode is selected at the encoder, no
inter-frame prediction is performed for the identified texture regions.
Instead, displacement of the entire region is modeled by just one set of motion
parameters. Therefore, only the model parameters are transmitted to the decoder
for reconstructing the texture regions. Non-texture regions in the frame are
coded conventionally. We show that for many standard test sets, the proposed

user grouping in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where
the motivation comes from the fact that the channel estimation performance can
be improved if we exploit additional common sparsity among nearby users. In the
literature, a commonly used group sparsity model assumes that users in each
group share a uniform sparsity pattern. In practice, however, this
oversimplified assumption usually fails to hold, even for physically close
users. Outliers deviated from the uniform sparsity pattern in each group may
significantly degrade the effectiveness of common sparsity, and hence bring
limited (or negative) gain for channel estimation. To better capture the group
sparse structure in practice, we provide a general model having two sparsity
components: commonly shared sparsity and individual sparsity, where the
additional individual sparsity accounts for any outliers. Then, we propose a
novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based framework to address the joint
channel estimation and user grouping problem under the general sparsity model.
The framework can fully exploit the common sparsity among nearby users and
exclude the harmful effect from outliers simultaneously. Simulation results
reveal substantial performance gains over the existing state-of-the-art
baselines.

asteroseismic and astrometric observations allow independent measurements of
stellar masses. We used six months of Kepler photometry available for HD 188753
to detect the oscillation envelopes of the two brightest stars. For each star,
we extracted the individual mode frequencies by fitting the power spectrum
using a maximum likelihood estimation approach. We then derived initial guesses
of the stellar masses and ages based on two seismic parameters and on a
characteristic frequency ratio, and modelled the two components independently
with the stellar evolution code CESTAM. In addition, we derived the masses of
the three stars by applying a Bayesian analysis to the position and
radial-velocity measurements of the system. Based on stellar modelling, the
mean common age of the system is $10.8 \pm 0.2\,$Gyr and the masses of the two
seismic components are $M_A =$ $0.99 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and $M_{Ba} =$ $0.86

0.767 \pm 0.006$, the mass of the faintest star is $M_{Bb} =$ $0.66 \pm
0.01\,M_\odot$ and the total seismic mass of the system is then $M_{syst} =$
$2.51 \pm 0.02\,M_\odot$. This value agrees perfectly with the total mass
derived from our orbital analysis, $M_{syst} =$
$2.51^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\,M_\odot$, and leads to the best current estimate of the
parallax for the system, $\pi = 21.9 \pm 0.2\,$mas. In addition, the minimal
relative inclination between the inner and outer orbits is $10.9^\circ \pm

the major challenges in this large scale statistical inference problem and

of defaults and assessing the associated uncertainties, our method can also be
applied for evaluating the aggregated market credit risk level. Upon analyzing

importance sampling is used widely. The optimal importance sampling density was
derived in 1950s for the deterministic simulation model, which maps an input to
an output deterministically, and is approximated in practice using various
methods. For the stochastic simulation model whose output is random given an
input, the optimal importance sampling density was derived only recently. In
the existing literature, metamodel-based approaches have been used to
approximate this optimal density. However, building a satisfactory metamodel is
often difficult or time-consuming in practice. This paper proposes a
cross-entropy based method, which is automatic and does not require specific
domain knowledge. The proposed method uses an expectation-maximization
algorithm to guide the choice of a mixture distribution model for approximating
the optimal density. The method iteratively updates the approximated density to
minimize its estimated discrepancy, measured by estimated cross-entropy, from
the optimal density. The mixture model's complexity is controlled using the
cross-entropy information criterion. The method is empirically validated using
extensive numerical studies and applied to a case study of evaluating the
reliability of wind turbine using a stochastic simulation model.

of the fundamental properties of light. Here we investigate the spatial
coherence of highly multimode lasers in the regime of short time scales.
Counter intuitively, we show that in this regime, the temporal (longitudinal)
modes play a crucial role in spatial coherence reduction. To evaluate the
spatial coherence we measured the temporal dynamics of speckle fields generated
by a highly multimode laser with over $10^5$ lasing spatial (transverse) modes,
and examined the dependence of speckle contrast on the exposure time of the
detecting device. We show that in the regime of short time scale, the spatial
and temporal modes interact to form spatio-temporal supermodes, such that the
spatial degrees of freedom are encoded onto the temporal modes. As a result,
the speckle contrast depends on the number of temporal modes, and the degree of
spatial coherence is reduced and the speckle contrast is suppressed. In the
regime of long times scale, the supermodes are no longer a valid representation
of the laser modal structure. Consequently, the spatial coherence is
independent of the temporal modes, and the classical result, where the speckle
contrast is suppressed as the number of spatial modes, is obtained. Due to this
new spatio-temporal mechanism, highly multimode lasers can be used for speckle
suppression in high-speed full-field imaging applications, as we demonstrate
here for imaging of a fast moving object.

ambient backscatter is quickly emerging as an appealing solution for this

bit error rate for the ambient backscatter system. In particular, we formulate
a binary hypothesis testing problem at the receiver and analyze system
performance under three detection techniques: a) mean threshold (MT), b)
maximum likelihood threshold (MLT), and c) approximate MLT. Motivated by the
energy-constrained nature of IoT devices, we perform the above analyses for two
receiver types: i) the ones that can accurately track channel state information
(CSI), and ii) the ones that cannot. Two main features of the analysis that
distinguish this work from the prior art are the characterization of the exact
conditional density functions of the average received signal energy, and the
characterization of exact average bit error rate (BER) for this setup. The key
challenge lies in the handling of correlation between channel gains of two
hypotheses for the derivation of joint probability distribution of magnitude
squared channel gains that is needed for the BER analysis.

is found that the shapes and sizes of the resulting nebula are very sensitive
to the effective temperature of the remnant core, the mass-loss rate at the
onset of the common envelope phase, and the mass ratio of the binary system.
These parameters are related to the efficiency of the mass ejection after the
spiral-in phase, the stellar evolutionary phase (i.e., RG, AGB or TP-AGB), and
the degree of departure from spherical symmetry in the stellar wind mass loss
process itself respectively. It is found that the shapes are mostly bipolar in
the early phase of evolution, but can quickly transition to elliptical and
barrel-type shapes. Solutions for nested lobes are found where the outer lobes
are usually bipolar and the inner lobes are elliptical, bipolar or barrel-type,
a result due to the flow of the photo-evaporated gas from the equatorial
region. It is found that the lobes can be produced without the need for two
distinct mass ejection events. In all the computations, the bulk of the mass is
concentrated in the orbital or equatorial plane, in the form of a large toroid,
which can be either neutral (early phases) or photoionized (late phases),

excluding any additional ultraviolet cancellations at this loop-order. We note
nontrivial relations between the integrals describing this leading ultraviolet

clean data, we propose a calibrated zero-norm regularized LS (CaZnRLS)
estimator by constructing a calibrated least squares loss with a positive
definite projection of an unbiased surrogate for the covariance matrix of
covariates, and use the multi-stage convex relaxation approach to compute the
CaZnRLS estimator. Under a restricted eigenvalue condition on the true matrix
of covariates, we derive the $\ell_2$-error bound of every iterate and
establish the decreasing of the error bound sequence, and the sign consistency
of the iterates after finite steps. The statistical guarantees are also
provided for the CaZnRLS estimator under two types of measurement errors.
Numerical comparisons with CoCoLasso and NCL (the nonconvex Lasso proposed by
Poh and Wainwright \cite{Loh11}) demonstrate that CaZnRLS not only has the
comparable or even better relative RSME but also has the least number of
incorrect predictors identified.

that there are several magnetic field components which are consistent at
near-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. Using the

avoid exhaustive search across image. In very high resolution (VHR) optical
image, ships appeared as a cluster of abnormal bright pixels in open sea
clutter (noise-like background). Anomaly-based detector utilizing Panchromatic
(PAN) data has been widely used in many researches to detect ships, however,
still facing two main drawbacks: 1) detection rate tend to be low particularly
when a ship is low contrast and 2) these models require a high manual
configuration to select a threshold value best separate ships from sea surface
background. This paper aims at further investigation of anomaly-based model to
solve those issues. First, pan-sharpened Multi Spectral (MS) data is
incorporated together with PAN to enhance ship discrimination. Second, we
propose an improved anomaly-based model combining both global intensity anomaly
and local texture anomaly map. Regarding noise appeared due to the present of
sea clutter and because of pan-sharpen process, texture abnormality suppression
term based on quantization theory is introduced. Experimental results on
VNREDSat-1 VHR optical satellite images suggest that the pan-sharpened
near-infrared (P-NIR) band can improve discrimination of ships from surrounding
waters. Compared to state-of-the-art anomaly-based detectors, our proposed
anomaly-based model on the combination of PAN and P-NIR data cannot only
achieved highest ship detection's recall rate (91.14% and 45.9% on
high-contrast and low-contrast dataset respectively) but also robust to
different automatic threshold selection techniques.

  Tracker",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object tracking is a hot topic in computer vision. Thanks to the booming of
the very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing techniques, it is now possible to
track targets of interests in satellite videos. However, since the targets in
the satellite videos are usually too small compared with the entire image, and
too similar with the background, most state-of-the-art algorithms failed to
track the target in satellite videos with a satisfactory accuracy. Due to the
fact that optical flow shows the great potential to detect even the slight
movement of the targets, we proposed a multi-frame optical flow tracker (MOFT)
for object tracking in satellite videos. The Lucas-Kanade optical flow method
was fused with the HSV color system and integral image to track the targets in
the satellite videos, while multi-frame difference method was utilized in the
optical flow tracker for a better interpretation. The experiments with three
VHR remote sensing satellite video datasets indicate that compared with
state-of-the-art object tracking algorithms, the proposed method can track the
target more accurately.

collection of machines connected through a network. This paper looks into the
feasibility of scaling up such a shared-nothing system while processing a
compute- and communication-intensive workload---processing distributed joins.
By exploiting multiple processing cores within the individual machines, we
implement a system to process database joins that parallelizes computation
within each node, pipelines the computation with communication, parallelizes
the communication by allowing multiple simultaneous data transfers
(send/receive), and removes synchronization barriers (a scalability bottleneck
in a distributed data processing system). Our experimental results show that
using only four threads per node the framework achieves a 3.5x gains in
intra-node performance while compared with a single-threaded counterpart.
Moreover, with the join processing workload the cluster-wide performance (and
speedup) is observed to be dictated by the intra-node computational loads; this
property brings a near-linear speedup with increasing nodes in the system, a
feature much desired in modern large-scale data processing system.

quantify. For instance, entrainment is widely believed to be a fundamentally
turbulent process, even though Turner (1957) pointed out that dry thermals
entrain primarily because of buoyancy (via a dynamical constraint requiring an
increase in radius $r$), rather than turbulence. Furthermore, entrainment has
been postulated to obey a $1/r$ scaling, but this scaling has not been firmly
established. Here, we study the classic case of dry, turbulent thermals in a
neutrally stratified environment using fully resolved direct numerical
simulation. We combine this with a thermal tracking algorithm which defines a
control volume for the thermal at each time, allowing us to directly measure
entrainment. We test Turner's argument by varying the Reynolds number Re of our
thermals between laminar (Re~600) and turbulent (Re~6000) regimes, finding only
a 20% variation in entrainment rate $\epsilon$, supporting the claim that
turbulence is not necessary for entrainment. We also directly verify the
postulated $\epsilon\sim 1/r$ scaling law.

problems in uncertainty quantification, namely the emulation and calibration of

the jointly robust prior, for both the emulation and calibration. This prior is
designed to maintain various advantages from the reference prior. In emulation,
the jointly robust prior has an appropriate tail decay rate as the reference
prior, and is computationally simpler than the reference prior in parameter

robust prior can separate the influential and inert inputs in mathematical
models, while the reference prior does not have this property. We establish the
posterior propriety for a large class of priors in calibration, including the
reference prior and jointly robust prior in general scenarios, but the jointly

predicts the reality well. The jointly robust prior is used as the default

challenging and involve large apparatuses containing conducting fluids subject
to fast helical flows. Here we propose that electronic solid-state materials --

observe some aspects of the dynamo effect. Motivated by recent experimental
developments, this paper focuses on hydrodynamic Weyl semimetals, where the
dominant scattering mechanism is due to interactions. We derive Navier-Stokes
equations along with equations of magneto-hydrodynamics that describe transport
of Weyl electron-hole plasma appropriate in this regime. We estimate the
hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds numbers for this system. The latter is a key
figure of merit of the dynamo mechanism. We show that it can be relatively
large to enable observation of the dynamo-induced magnetic field bootstrap in

  conference LICS'2018",,,,"cs.LO cs.CC cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider distribution-based objectives for Markov Decision Processes
(MDP). This class of objectives gives rise to an interesting trade-off between
full and partial information. As in full observation, the strategy in the MDP
can depend on the state of the system, but similar to partial information, the
strategy needs to account for all the states at the same time. In this paper,
we focus on two safety problems that arise naturally in this context, namely,
existential and universal safety. Given an MDP A and a closed and convex
polytope H of probability distributions over the states of A, the existential
safety problem asks whether there exists some distribution d in H and a
strategy of A, such that starting from d and repeatedly applying this strategy
keeps the distribution forever in H. The universal safety problem asks whether
for all distributions in H, there exists such a strategy of A which keeps the
distribution forever in H. We prove that both problems are decidable, with
tight complexity bounds: we show that existential safety is PTIME-complete,
while universal safety is co-NP-complete. Further, we compare these results
with existential and universal safety problems for Rabin's probabilistic
finite-state automata (PFA), the subclass of Partially Observable MDPs which
have zero observation. Compared to MDPs, strategies of PFAs are not
state-dependent. In sharp contrast to the PTIME result, we show that
existential safety for PFAs is undecidable, with H having closed and open
boundaries. On the other hand, it turns out that the universal safety for PFAs
is decidable in EXPTIME, with a co-NP lower bound. Finally, we show that an
alternate representation of the input polytope allows us to improve the
complexity of universal safety for MDPs and PFAs.

overcome these difficulties, while conventional quantum repeaters require
matter-based operations with long-lived quantum memories, recent proposals have
employed encoded multiple photons in entanglement, providing an alternative way
for scalability. In pursuing scalable quantum communications, naturally arising
questions are thus whether any ultimate limit exists in all-optical
scalability, and whether and how it can be achieved. Motivated by these
questions, we derive the fundamental limits of the efficiency and
loss-tolerance of the Bell measurement with multiple photons, restricted not by
protocols but by the laws of physics, i.e. linear optics and no-cloning
theorem. We then propose a Bell measurement scheme with linear optics, which
enables one to reach both the fundamental limits: one by linear optics and the
other by the no-cloning theorem. The quantum repeater based on our scheme
allows one to achieve fast and efficient quantum communication over arbitrary
long distances, outperforming previous all-photonic and matter-based protocols.

Our work systematically compares two distinct models for the central engine,

successful structured jet and a quasi-isotropic explosion respectively. Both
engine models naturally evolve angular and radial structure through
hydrodynamical interaction with the merger debris cloud. They both also result

flash. This component is a consequence of applying the synchrotron radiation
model to the shocked optically thin merger cloud. Such modeling is appropriate
if injection of non-thermal electrons is sustained in the breakout relativistic
shell, for example by internal shocks or magnetic reconnection. The rapidly
declining signature may be detectable for future BNS mergers during the first

end-to-end driving systems by providing a cheap, safe, and diverse training

of transferring such policies to the real world. We present an approach to
transferring driving policies from simulation to reality via modularity and
abstraction. Our approach is inspired by classic driving systems and aims to
combine the benefits of modular architectures and end-to-end deep learning
approaches. The key idea is to encapsulate the driving policy such that it is
not directly exposed to raw perceptual input or low-level vehicle dynamics. We
evaluate the presented approach in simulated urban environments and in the real

1/5-scale robotic truck that is deployed in a variety of conditions, with no

phase. We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the
astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these results performed
within the astrometry task. Some 320 billion centroid positions from the
pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five
astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332
million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for
an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. Special validation solutions
were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and
proper motion. For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the
median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is
about 0.04 mas for bright (G<14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G=17 mag, and 0.7 mas
at G=20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties
are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas/yr, respectively. The optical reference frame
defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to
the quasars to within 0.15 mas/yr. From the quasars and validation solutions we
estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude,
and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too
small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in
parallax and 0.07 mas/yr in proper motion are seen on small (<1 deg) and
intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for
the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.

system to achieve the demanding accuracy and precision constraints that Gaia is
capable of delivering. The internal Gaia photometric system was initialised
using an iterative process that is solely based on Gaia data. A set of
calibrations was derived for the entire Gaia DR2 baseline and then used to
produce the final mean source photometry. The photometric catalogue contains
2.5 billion sources comprised of three different grades depending on the
availability of colour information and the procedure used to calibrate them:
1.5 billion gold, 144 million silver, and 0.9 billion bronze. These figures
reflect the results of the photometric processing; the content of the data
release will be different due to the validation and data quality filters
applied during the catalogue preparation. The photometric processing pipeline,
PhotPipe, implements all the processing and calibration workflows in terms of
Map/Reduce jobs based on the Hadoop platform. This is the first example of a
processing system for a large astrophysical survey project to make use of these
technologies. The improvements in the generation of the integrated G-band
fluxes, in the attitude modelling, in the cross-matching, and and in the
identification of spurious detections led to a much cleaner input stream for
the photometric processing. This, combined with the improvements in the
definition of the internal photometric system and calibration flow, produced
high-quality photometry. Hadoop proved to be an excellent platform choice for
the implementation of PhotPipe in terms of overall performance, scalability,
downtime, and manpower required for operations and maintenance.

complementing the kinematic data of a sample of about 7 million relatively
bright, late-type stars. Aims: This paper provides a detailed description of
the Gaia spectroscopic data processing pipeline, and of the approach adopted to
derive the radial velocities presented in DR2. Methods: The pipeline must
perform four main tasks: (i) clean and reduce the spectra observed with the
Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS); (ii) calibrate the RVS instrument,
including wavelength, straylight, line-spread function, bias non-uniformity,
and photometric zeropoint; (iii) extract the radial velocities; and (iv) verify
the accuracy and precision of the results. The radial velocity of a star is
obtained through a fit of the RVS spectrum relative to an appropriate synthetic
template spectrum. An additional task of the spectroscopic pipeline was to
provide 1st-order estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters required to
select such template spectra. We describe the pipeline features and present the
detailed calibration algorithms and software solutions we used to produce the
radial velocities published in DR2. Results: The spectroscopic processing
pipeline produced median radial velocities for Gaia stars with narrow-band
near-IR magnitude Grvs < 12 (i.e. brighter than V~13). Stars identified as
double-lined spectroscopic binaries were removed from the pipeline, while
variable stars, single-lined, and non-detected double-lined spectroscopic
binaries were treated as single stars. The scatter in radial velocity among
different observations of a same star, also published in DR2, provides
information about radial velocity variability. For the hottest (Teff > 7000 K)
and coolest (Teff < 3500 K) stars, the accuracy and precision of the stellar
parameter estimates are not sufficient to allow selection of appropriate
templates. [Abridged]

on-board Gaia, were processed and median radial velocities were derived for 9.8
million sources brighter than Grvs = 12 mag. This paper describes the
validation and properties of the median radial velocities published in GDR2.
Quality tests and filters are applied to select, from the 9.8 million radial
velocities, those with the quality to be published in GDR2. The accuracy of the
selected sample is assessed with respect to ground-based catalogues. Its
precision is estimated using both ground-based catalogues and the distribution
of the Gaia radial velocity uncertainties. GDR2 contains median radial
velocities for 7 224 631 stars, with Teff in the range [3550, 6900] K, which
passed succesfully the quality tests. The published median radial velocities
provide a full sky-coverage and have a completness with respect to the
astrometric data of 77.2\% (for $G \leq 12.5$ mag). The median radial velocity
residuals with respect to the ground-based surveys vary from one catalogue to
another, but do not exceed a few 100s m/s. In addition, the Gaia radial
velocities show a positive trend as a function of magnitude, which starts
around Grvs $\sim 9$ mag and reaches about $+500$ m/s at Grvs $= 11.75$ mag.
The overall precision, estimated from the median of the Gaia radial velocity
uncertainties, is 1.05 km/s. The radial velocity precision is function of many
parameters, in particular the magnitude and effective temperature. For bright
stars, Grvs in [4, 8] mag, the precision is in the range 200-350 m/s, which is

identification of variable source candidates of RR Lyrae stars, Cepheids, long
period variables (LPVs), rotation modulation (BY Dra-type) stars, delta Scuti &
SX Phoenicis stars, and short-timescale variables. In this release we aim to
provide useful but not necessarily complete samples of candidates.
  The processed Gaia data consist of the G, BP, and RP photometry during the
first 22 months of operations as well as positions and parallaxes. Various
methods from classical statistics, data mining and time series analysis were
applied and tailored to the specific properties of Gaia data, as well as
various visualisation tools.
  The DR2 variability release contains: 228'904 RR Lyrae stars, 11'438
Cepheids, 151'761 LPVs, 147'535 stars with rotation modulation, 8'882 delta
Scuti & SX Phoenicis stars, and 3'018 short-timescale variables. These results
are distributed over a classification and various Specific Object Studies (SOS)
tables in the Gaia archive, along with the three-band time series and
associated statistics for the underlying 550'737 unique sources. We estimate
that about half of them are newly identified variables. The variability type
completeness varies strongly as function of sky position due to the non-uniform
sky coverage and intermediate calibration level of this data. The probabilistic
and automated nature of this work implies certain completeness and
contamination rates which are quantified so that users can anticipate their
effects. This means that even well-known variable sources can be missed or
misidentified in the published data.
  The DR2 variability release only represents a small subset of the processed
data. Future releases will include more variable sources and data products;
however, DR2 shows the (already) very high quality of the data and great
promise for variability studies.

bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, Teff, for all sources brighter
than G=17 mag with Teff in the range 3000-10 000 K (161 million sources). Using
in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight extinction, A_G, and the
reddening, E[BP-RP], for 88 million sources. Together with a bolometric
correction we derive luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These
quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia-DR2. Here
we describe the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including
the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the
limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (Teff), 0.46
mag (A_G), 0.23 mag (E[BP-RP]), 15% (luminosity), and 10% (radius). Being based
on only a small number of observable quantities and limited training data, our
results are necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to
strong systematics in some cases (not included in the aforementioned accuracy
estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in
particular extinction. Yet in several regions of parameter space our results
show very good performance, for example for red clump stars and solar
analogues. Large uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the
individual star level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates.
We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used and
we define a ""clean"" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest
catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and
detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are
planned as part of the third Gaia data release.

astrometric data (positions, proper motions and parallaxes) for an
unprecedented amount of sources (more than $1.3$ billion, mostly stars). The
use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how
does one properly infer from these data the astrophysical parameters of
interest?
  The main - but not only - focus of this paper is the issue of the estimation
of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined with other information. We
start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain
distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on
how to use parallaxes more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian
methods. In particular also we show that negative parallaxes, or parallaxes
with relatively larger uncertainties still contain valuable information.
Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric
data for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and
parallaxes and the handling of covariances in the uncertainties.
  The paper contains examples based on simulated Gaia data to illustrate the
problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods
proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the Gaia
archive documentation that provide practical examples and a good starting point
for the application of the recommendations to actual problems. In all cases the
source code for the analysis methods is provided. Our main recommendation is to
always treat the derivation of (astro-) physical parameters from astrometric
data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which
should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.

the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different
HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim
here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary
aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. We describe
some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main
structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and
globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and
with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD
with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as
hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also
analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. The Gaia HRDs are
unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar
populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs
are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and
helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation
between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations
in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in
the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters
are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting
fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will
lead to more insight in stellar physics. Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of
combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in
stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for
HRD-based studies.

observations of solar system objects (SSOs) since the beginning of its
operations. Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains the observations of a selected
sample of 14,099 SSOs. These asteroids have been already identified and have
been numbered by the Minor Planet Center. Positions are provided for each Gaia
observation at CCD level. As additional information, the apparent brightness of
SSOs in the unfiltered G band is also provided for selected observations. We
explain the processing of SSO data, and describe the criteria we used to select
the sample published in Gaia DR2. We then explore the data set to assess its
quality. To exploit the epoch astrometry of asteroids in Gaia DR2 it is
necessary to take into account the unusual properties of the uncertainty, as
the position information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled
appropriately, an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are
overall consistent with the a-priori error model that was used to define
individual values of the astrometric uncertainty. The distribution of residuals
allowed us to identify possible contaminants in the data set. Photometry in the
G band was compared to computed values from reference asteroid shapes and to
the flux registered at the corresponding epochs by the red and blue photometers
(RP and BP). The overall astrometric performance is close to the expectations,
with an optimal range of brightness G~12-17. In this range, the typical
transit-level accuracy is well below 1 mas. For fainter asteroids, the growing
photon noise deteriorates the performance. Asteroids brighter than G~12 are
affected by a lower performance of the processing of their signals. The
dramatic improvement brought by Gaia DR2 astrometry of SSOs is demonstrated by
preliminary tests on the detection of subtle non-gravitational effects.

kinematics of the Milky Way disc, within a radius of several kiloparsecs around
the Sun. We benefit for the first time from a sample of 6.4 million F-G-K stars
with full 6D phase-space coordinates, precise parallaxes, and precise Galactic
cylindrical velocities . From this sample, we extracted a sub-sample of 3.2
million giant stars to map the velocity field of the Galactic disc from
$\sim$5~kpc to $\sim$13~kpc from the Galactic centre and up to 2~kpc above and
below the plane. We also study the distribution of 0.3 million solar
neighbourhood stars ($r < 200$~pc), with median velocity uncertainties of
0.4~km/s, in velocity space and use the full sample to examine how the
over-densities evolve in more distant regions. GDR2 allows us to draw 3D maps
of the Galactocentric median velocities and velocity dispersions with
unprecedented accuracy, precision, and spatial resolution. The maps show the
complexity and richness of the velocity field of the galactic disc. We observe
streaming motions in all the components of the velocities as well as patterns
in the velocity dispersions. For example, we confirm the previously reported
negative and positive galactocentric radial velocity gradients in the inner and
outer disc, respectively. Here, we see them as part of a non-axisymmetric
kinematic oscillation, and we map its azimuthal and vertical behaviour. We also
witness a new global arrangement of stars in the velocity plane of the solar
neighbourhood and in distant regions in which stars are organised in thin
substructures with the shape of circular arches that are oriented approximately
along the horizontal direction in the $U-V$ plane. Moreover, in distant
regions, we see variations in the velocity substructures more clearly than ever
before, in particular, variations in the velocity of the Hercules stream.

coupling constants are determined by the SU(3) symmetry, the interaction is
constructed and inserted into the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation to
search for poles in the complex plane, which correspond to molecular states.
Two poles are found with a spin parity $3/2^-$ near the $N\rho$ and the $\Sigma
K^*$ thresholds, which can be related to the $N(1700)$ and the $N(2100)$,
respectively. No pole near the $N\phi$ threshold can be found if direct
interaction between a nucleon and $\phi$ meson is neglected according to the
OZI rule. After introducing the QCD van der Waals force between a nucleon and

Inclusion of the QCD van der Waals force changes the line shape of the
invariant mass spectrum in the $N\phi$ channel leading to a worse agreement
with the present low-precision data. Future experiments at BelleII, JLab, and

semisimple quantum groups, that is, Drinfeld doubles of $ q $-deformations of
compact semisimple Lie groups.
  Our starting point is the deformation picture of the Baum-Connes assembly map
for a complex semisimple Lie group $ G $, which allows one to express the $ K
$-theory of the reduced group $ C^* $-algebra of $ G $ in terms of the $ K
$-theory of its associated Cartan motion group. The latter can be identified
with the semidirect product of the maximal compact subgroup $ K $ acting on $
\mathfrak{k}^* $ via the coadjoint action.
  In the quantum case the role of the Cartan motion group is played by the
Drinfeld double of the classical group $ K $, whose associated group $ C^*
$-algebra is the crossed product of $ C(K) $ with respect to the adjoint action
of $ K $. Our quantum assembly map is obtained by varying the deformation
parameter in the Drinfeld double construction applied to the standard
deformation $ K_q $ of $ K $. We prove that the quantum assembly map is an
isomorphism, thus providing a description of the $ K $-theory of complex
quantum groups in terms of classical topology.
  Moreover, we show that there is a continuous field of $ C^* $-algebras which
encodes both the quantum and classical assembly maps as well as a natural
deformation between them. It follows in particular that the quantum assembly
map contains the classical Baum-Connes assembly map as a direct summand.

Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The precision of the $H_{0}$ measurement depends on
the uncertainties in the time-delay measurements, the mass distribution of the
main deflector(s), and the mass distribution along the line of sight. Tie and
Kochanek (2018) have proposed a new microlensing effect on time delays based on
differential magnification of the coherent accretion disc variability of the
lensed quasar. If real, this effect could significantly broaden the uncertainty
on the time delay measurements by up to $30\%$ for lens systems such as
PG1115+080, which have relatively short time delays and monitoring over several
different epochs. In this paper we develop a new technique that uses the
time-delay ratios and simulated microlensing maps within a Bayesian framework
in order to limit the allowed combinations of microlensing delays and thus to
lessen the uncertainties due to the proposed effect. We show that, under the
assumption of Tie and Kochanek (2018), the uncertainty on the time-delay
distance ($D_{\Delta t}$, which is proportional to 1/$H_{0}$) of short
time-delay ($\sim18$ days) lens, PG1115+080, increases from $\sim7\%$ to
$\sim10\%$ by simultaneously fitting the three time-delay measurements from the
three different datasets across twenty years, while in the case of long

negligible as the uncertainty on $D_{\Delta t}$ of RXJ1131-1231 only increases

distance-hereditary graphs and some of their generalizations. This improves on
[Dragan, WG'97], who proposed such an algorithm for the subclass of
(tent,hexahedron)-free distance-hereditary graphs. Furthermore, our result is
derived from a more general one that is obtained for b-Matching. In the (unit
cost) b-Matching problem, we are given a graph G = (V, E) together with a
nonnegative integer capacity b v for every vertex v $\in$ V. The objective is
to assign nonnegative integer weights (x e) e$\in$E so that: for every v $\in$
V the sum of the weights of its incident edges does not exceed b v , and
e$\in$E x e is maximized. We present the first algorithm for solving b-Matching
on cographs, distance-hereditary graphs and some of their generalizations in
quasi linear time. For that, we use a decomposition algorithm that outputs for
any graph G a collection of subgraphs of G with no edge-cutsets inducing a
complete bipartite subgraph (a.k.a., splits). The latter collection is
sometimes called a split decomposition of G. Furthermore, there exists a
generic method in order to design graph algorithms based on split decomposition
[Rao, DAM'08]. However, this technique only applies to ""localized"" problems:
for which a ""best"" partial solution for any given subgraph in a split
decomposition can be computed almost independently from the remaining of the
graph. Such framework does not apply to matching problems since an augmenting
path may cross the subgraphs arbitrarily. We introduce a new technique that
somehow captures all the partial solutions for a given union of subgraphs in a
split decomposition, in a compact and amenable way for algorithms - assuming
some piecewise linear assumption holds on the value of such solutions. The
latter assumption is shown to hold for b-Matching. Doing so, we prove that
solving b-Matching on any pair G, b can be reduced in quasi linear-time to
solving this problem on a collection of smaller graphs: that are obtained from
the subgraphs in any split decomposition of G by replacing every vertex with a
constant-size module. In particular, if G has a split decomposition where all
subgraphs have order at most a fixed k, then we can solve b-Matching for G, b
in O((k log 2 k)$\times$(m+n)$\times$log ||b|| 1)-time. This answers an open
question of [Coudert et al., SODA'18].

points, the critical clearing angle (CCA) for the PSC-VSC is identified, which
is found equal to the power angle at the unstable equilibrium point of the
post-fault operation. This fixed CCA facilitates the design of power system
protection. Moreover, it is also found that the PSC-VSC can still
re-synchronize with the grid after around one cycle of oscillation, even if the
fault-clearing angle is beyond the CCA. This feature reduces the risk of system
collapse caused by the delayed fault clearance. These findings are corroborated

and softening performances. We presently study the structure and rheology of
these softener formulations and identify the mechanisms at the origin of these
effects.
  The polymer additives used are guar gum polysaccharides, one cationic and one
modified through addition of hydroxypropyl groups. Formulations with and
without guar polymers are investigated using optical and cryo-transmission
electron microscopy, small-angle light and Xray scattering and finally
rheology. Similar techniques are applied to study the phase behavior of
softener and cellulose nanocrystals considered here as a model for cotton.
  The esterquat surfactants are shown to assemble into micron-sized vesicles in
the dilute and concentrated regimes. In the former, guar addition in small
amounts does not impair the vesicular structure and stability. In the
concentrated regime, cationic guars induce a local crowding associated to
depletion interactions and leads to the formation of a local lamellar order. In
rheology, adjusting the polymer concentration at one tenth that of the
surfactant is sufficient to offset the decrease of the elastic property
associated with the surfactant reduction. In conclusion, we have shown that
through an appropriate choice of natural additives it is possible to lower the
concentration of surfactants in fabric conditioners by about half, a result
that could represent a significant breakthrough in current home care
formulations.

artifacts caused by zeros on the conical surface of the dipole kernel in

based on a direct k-space interpolation approach, avoiding problems of over
smoothing and streaking artifacts. Inspired by the recent theory of
annihilating filter-based low-rank Hankel matrix approach (ALOHA), QSM
reconstruction problem is formulated as deconvolution problem under low-rank
Hankel matrix constraint in the k-space. To reduce the computational complexity
and the memory requirement, the problem is formulated as successive
reconstruction of 2-D planes along three independent axes of the 3-D phase
image in Fourier domain. Extensive experiments were performed to verify and
compare the proposed method with existing QSM reconstruction methods. The
proposed ALOHA-QSM effectively reduced streaking artifacts and accurately
estimated susceptibility values in deep gray matter structures, compared to the
existing QSM methods. Our suggested ALOHA-QSM algorithm successfully solves the
three-dimensional QSM dipole inversion problem without additional anatomical
information or prior assumption and provides good image quality and
quantitative accuracy.

The central star-forming galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological numerical

the relation assuming that the physical mechanism responsible for the
anti-correlation between size and gas-phase metallicity is the same in the
simulated and the observed galaxies. We consider the three most likely causes:
(1) metal-poor gas inflows feeding the star-formation process, (2) metal-rich
gas outflows particularly efficient in shallow gravitational potentials, and
(3) enhanced efficiency of the star-formation process in compact galaxies.
Outflows (2) and enhanced star-formation efficiency (3) can be discarded.
Metal-poor gas inflows (1) cause the correlation in the simulated galaxies.
Galaxies grow in size with time, so those that receive gas later are both metal
poorer and larger, giving rise to the observed anti-correlation. As expected
within this explanation, larger galaxies have younger stellar populations. We
explore the variation with redshift of the relation, which is maintained up to,
at least, redshift 8.

  algorithms on some graph classes",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the following general question: given a graph class C on which we
can solve Maximum Matching in (quasi) linear time, does the same hold true for
the class of graphs that can be modularly decomposed into C ? A major
difficulty in this task is that the Maximum Matching problem is not preserved
by quotient, thereby making difficult to exploit the structural properties of
the quotient subgraphs of the modular decomposition. So far, we are only aware
of a recent framework in [Coudert et al., SODA'18] that only applies when the
quotient subgraphs have bounded order and/or under additional assumptions on
the nontriv-ial modules in the graph. As a first attempt toward improving this
framework we study the combined effect of modular decomposition with a pruning
process over the quotient subgraphs. More precisely, we remove sequentially
from all such subgraphs their so-called one-vertex extensions (i.e., pendant,
anti-pendant, twin, universal and isolated vertices). Doing so, we obtain a
""pruned modular decomposition"", that can be computed in O(m log n)-time. Our
main result is that if all the pruned quotient subgraphs have bounded order
then a maximum matching can be computed in linear time. This result is mostly
based on two pruning rules on pendant and anti-pendant modules -- that are
adjacent, respectively, to one or all but one other modules in the graph.
Furthermore, these two latter rules are surprisingly intricate and we consider
them as our main technical contribution in the paper. We stress that the class
of graphs that can be totally decomposed by the pruned modular decomposition
contains all the distance-hereditary graphs, and so, it is larger than
cographs. In particular, as a byproduct of our approach we also obtain the
first known linear-time algorithms for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary
graphs and graphs with modular-treewidth at most one. Finally, we can use an
extended version of our framework in order to compute a maximum matching, in
linear-time, for all graph classes that can be modularly decomposed into
cycles. Our work is the first to explain why the existence of some nice
ordering over the modules of a graph, instead of just over its vertices, can
help to speed up the computation of maximum matchings on some graph classes.

effective field theory (EFT) where an effective Standard Model (SM) is used

Particularly, we firstly extract words and sentences from the training movie
subtitles. Then the hierarchically formed movie representations, which are
learned from LMN, not only encode the correspondence between words and visual
content inside frames, but also encode the temporal alignment between sentences
and frames inside movie clips. We also extend our LMN model into three variant
frameworks to illustrate the good extendable capabilities. We conduct extensive
experiments on the MovieQA dataset. With only visual content as inputs, LMN
with frame-level representation obtains a large performance improvement. When
incorporating subtitles into LMN to form the clip-level representation, we
achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the online evaluation task of
'Video+Subtitles'. The good performance successfully demonstrates that the

the physical properties of the star, such as the equation of state. Observing
pulsating neutron stars therefore allows one to place constraints on these
physical properties. However, it is not obvious exactly how much can be learnt
from such measurements. If we observe for long enough, and precisely enough, is
it possible to learn everything about the star? A classical result in the
theory of spectral geometry states that one cannot uniquely `hear the shape of
a drum'. More formally, it is known that an eigenfrequency spectrum may not
uniquely correspond to a particular geometry; some `drums' may be
indistinguishable from a normal-mode perspective. In contrast, we show that the
drum result does not extend to perturbations of simple neutron stars within
general relativity -- in the case of axial (toroidal) perturbations of static,
perfect fluid stars, a quasi-normal mode spectrum uniquely corresponds to a
stellar profile. We show in this paper that it is not possible for two neutron

maps are dense. The extra-nice dimensions are characterized by the property
that discriminants of stable germs in one dimension higher have $\mathcal
A_e$-codimension 1 hyperplane sections. They are also related to the simplicity
of $\mathcal A_e$-codimension 2 germs. We give a sufficient condition for any
$\mathscr A_e$-codimension 2 germ to be simple and give an example of a corank
2 codimension 2 germ in the nice dimensions which is not simple. Then we
establish the boundary of the extra-nice dimensions. Finally we answer a
question posed by Wall about the codimension of non-simple maps.

adhesion energy) but provides no further information on the tensorial nature

approaches (e.g. rule of mixtures, Eshelby, Mori-Tanaka and self-consistent

stiffness tensor from the knowledge of the porosity and the elastic constants
of the beads. Herein, the self-consistent scheme accurately predicts both bulk

than 35%, for layers composed of particles as small as 15 nm in diameter.
Conversely, Kendall's approach is found to predict the Young's modulus over the

adjusted to a value of the order of the fracture energy of the particle

fingerprints associated with the anisotropy, we propose a simple scaling of the
Hanle line shapes at specific magnetic field orientations that results in a
universal curve only in the isotropic case. The deviation from the universal

to develop a computer-aided diagnostic approach for CLE imaging of human glioma

features localization from CLE images by employing a novel multiscale
activation map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated. To
validate our method, we compared proposed model's output to the manual
annotation performed by four neurosurgeons on test images. Proposed model
achieved 88% mean accuracy and 86% mean intersection over union on intermediate

enhance the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma \to \gamma} ({\cal E})$ of a
beam emitted by a far-away source through the mechanism of photon-ALP
oscillation (${\cal E}$ denotes the energy). But in order for this to work, an
external magnetic field ${\bf B}$ must be present. In several cases ${\bf B}$
is modeled as a domain-like network with `sharp edges': all domains have the
same size $L_{\rm dom}$ (set by the ${\bf B}$ coherence length) and the same
strength B, but the direction of ${\bf B}$ changes randomly and abruptly from
one domain to the next. It is obviously a highly mathematical idealization
wherein the components of ${\bf B}$ are discontinuous across the edges (whence
the name sharp edges). It is therefore highly desirable to go a step further,
and to find out what happens when the edges are smoothed out, namely when the
abrupt change of ${\bf B}$ is replaced by a smooth one. Moreover, this step
becomes compelling when the photon-ALP oscillation length $l_{\rm osc}$ turns
out to be comparable to -- or smaller than -- $L_{\rm dom}$, because in this
case the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma \to \gamma} ({\cal E})$
critically depends on the domain shape. In the present paper we propose a
smoothed out version of the previous domain-like structure of ${\bf B}$ which
incorporates the above changes, and we work out its implications. Even in the
present case we are able to solve analytically and exactly the photon/ALP beam
propagation equation inside a single smoothed-out domain, thereby evaluating
the corresponding $P_{\gamma \to \gamma} ({\cal E})$ exactly. Our results is of
particular importance in view of the new generation of gamma-ray detectors,
since in such a situation $l_{\rm osc} \lesssim L_{\rm dom}$ occurs just above
the TeV scale.

wind speeds of planetary atmospheres of the Solar system. However, most
knowledge about atmospheric dynamics has been obtained with cloud-tracking
technique, which consists of tracking visible features from images taken at
different dates. Doppler imaging is as challenging - motions can be less than
100 m/s - as appealing because it measures the speed of cloud particles instead
of large cloud structures. Significant difference is expected in case of
atmospheric waves interfering with cloud structures. The purpose of this paper
is to provide a theoretical basis for conducting accurate Doppler measurements
of planetary atmospheres, especially from the ground with reflected solar
absorption lines. We focus on three aspects which lead to significant biases.
Firstly, we fully review the Young effect, which is an artificial radial
velocity field caused by the solar rotation that mimics a retrograde planetary
rotation. Secondly, we extensively study the impact of atmospheric seeing and
show that it modifies the apparent location of the planet in the sky whenever
the planet is not observed at full phase (opposition). Besides, the seeing
convolves regions of variable radial velocity and photometry, which biases
radial-velocity measurements, by reducing the apparent amplitude of atmospheric
motions. Finally, we propose a method to interpret data, i.e., how to retrieve
zonal, meridional, vertical, and subsolar-to-antisolar circulation from radial
velocity maps, by optimizing the signal to noise ratio.

neutrino experiments by means of the inverse beta decay, producing both a
positron and a neutron. The positron may form a bound state together with an
electron, called positronium (Ps). The longer-lived spin state of Ps,
orthopositronium (o-Ps) has a lifetime of about $3\,\mathrm{ns}$ in organic
liquid scintillators (LS). Its formation changes the time distribution of
photon emission, which affects positron reconstruction algorithms and allows
the application of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) to distinguish electron
from positron events. In this work, we measured the lifetime $\tau_2$ of o-Ps
in the linear alkylbenzene (LAB) based LS of the JUNO (Jiangmen Underground
Neutrino Observatory) experiment including wavelength shifters, obtaining
$\tau_2 = 2.97\,\mathrm{ns} \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{ns}$. Due to systematics, which
are not yet completely understood, we are not able to give a final result for
the o-Ps formation probability $I_2$. We use a novel type of setup, which
allows a better background suppression as compared to commonly used PALS
(positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy) measurements.

learn novel concepts from only a few examples. Mimicking the same behavior on
machine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research
problem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In
this context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning
system that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel
categories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not
forget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base
categories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object
recognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight
generator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine
similarity function between feature representations and classification weight
vectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base
categories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on
""unseen"" categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet
where we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition
(i.e., we achieve 56.20% and 73.00% on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings
respectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the
base categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack.
Finally, we apply our approach on the recently introduced few-shot benchmark of
Bharath and Girshick [4] where we also achieve state-of-the-art results. The

point is a point on the image plane where parallel lines in 3D space appear to
converge, whereas a vanishing line passes through 2 or more vanishing points.
While such concepts are simple and intuitive in perspective cameras, their

more involved. For example, lines in the 3D space map to higher degree curves
in catadioptric cameras. The projection of a set of 3D parallel lines converges
on a single point in perspective images, whereas they converge to more than one
point in catadioptric cameras. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware
of any systematic development of analytical models for vanishing points and
vanishing curves in different types of catadioptric cameras. In this paper, we
derive parametric equations for vanishing points and vanishing curves using the

comprise modeling of interference from heterogeneous interfering sources with
time-frequency asynchronous radio-resource usage patterns, and benefit from
realistic distribution processes for modeling channel fading and locations of
interfering sources. We further present a cost model for the access network as
a function of provisioned resources like density of access points (APs), and a
battery lifetime model for IoT devices as a function of intrinsic parameters,
e.g. level of stored energy, and network parameters, e.g. reliability of

entire images all at once, making the models prone to being trapped in
sub-optimums due to the introduced false positive examples. Unlike them, we
propose a zigzag learning strategy to simultaneously discover reliable object
instances and prevent the model from overfitting initial seeds. Towards this
goal, we first develop a criterion named mean Energy Accumulation Scores (mEAS)
to automatically measure and rank localization difficulty of an image
containing the target object, and accordingly learn the detector progressively
by feeding examples with increasing difficulty. In this way, the model can be
well prepared by training on easy examples for learning from more difficult
ones and thus gain a stronger detection ability more efficiently. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel masking regularization strategy over the high level
convolutional feature maps to avoid overfitting initial samples. These two
modules formulate a zigzag learning process, where progressive learning
endeavors to discover reliable object instances, and masking regularization
increases the difficulty of finding object instances properly. We achieve 47.6%

dynamo model. Although this is primarily a theoretical thesis, there is a part
dealing with the analysis of observational data. The various proxies of solar
activity from various observatory including the sunspot area records of
Kodaikanal Observatory have been analyzed to study the irregular aspects of
solar cycles and an analysis has been carried out on the correlation between
the decay rate and the next cycle amplitude. Theoretical analysis starts with
explaining how the magnetic buoyancy has been treated in the flux transport
dynamo models, and advantages and disadvantages of different treatments. It is
found that some of the irregular properties of the solar cycle in the decaying
phase can only be well explained using a particular treatment of the magnetic
buoyancy. Next, the behavior of the dynamo with different spatial structures of
the meridional flow based on recent helioseismology results has been studied. A
theoretical model is constructed considering the back reaction due to the
Lorentz force on the meridional flows which explains the observed variation of
the meridional flow with the solar cycle. Finally, some results with 3D FTD
models are presented. This 3D model is developed to handle the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism and magnetic buoyancy more realistically than previous 2D models and
can capture some important effects connected with the subduction of the
magnetic field in polar regions, which are missed in 2D surface flux transport
models. This 3D model is further used to study the evolution of the magnetic
fields due to a turbulent non-axisymmetric velocity field and to compare the
results with the results obtained by using a simple turbulent diffusivity
coefficient.

interdependent complex network. The effects of changing network topology,
average number of links and asymmetry in size of the citizen and officer

the extent of the advantage depends critically on the network degree and

counts of highly-cited documents could be affected by the choice of data
source. The initial hypothesis is that databases that rely on journal selection
criteria for their document coverage may not necessarily provide an accurate
representation of highly-cited documents across all subject areas, while
inclusive databases, which give each document the chance to stand on its own
merits, might be better suited to identify highly-cited documents. To test this
hypothesis, an analysis of 2,515 highly-cited documents published in 2006 that
Google Scholar displays in its Classic Papers product is carried out at the
level of broad subject categories, checking whether these documents are also
covered in Web of Science and Scopus, and whether the citation counts offered
by the different sources are similar. The results show that a large fraction of
highly-cited documents in the Social Sciences and Humanities (8.6%-28.2%) are
invisible to Web of Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and Health
Sciences the proportion of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and
Scopus is much lower. Furthermore, in all areas, Spearman correlation
coefficients of citation counts in Google Scholar, as compared to Web of
Science and Scopus citation counts, are remarkably strong (.83-.99). The main
conclusion is that the data about highly-cited documents available in the
inclusive database Google Scholar does indeed reveal significant coverage
deficiencies in Web of Science and Scopus in several areas of research.
Therefore, using these selective databases to compute bibliometric indicators
based on counts of highly-cited documents might produce biased assessments in
poorly covered areas.

  Sensing",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Real-time (RT) assessment of ventricular volumes and function
enables data acquisition during free-breathing. However, in children the
requirement for high spatiotemporal resolution requires accelerated imaging
techniques. In this study, we implemented a novel RT bSSFP spiral sequence
reconstructed using Compressed Sensing (CS) and validated it against the
breath-hold (BH) reference standard for assessment of ventricular volumes in
children with heart disease.
  Methods: Data was acquired in 60 children. Qualitative image scoring and
evaluation of ventricular volumes was performed by 3 clinical cardiac MR
specialists. 30 cases were reassessed for intra-observer variability, and the
other 30 cases for inter-observer variability.
  Results: Spiral RT images were of good quality, however qualitative scores
reflected more residual artefact than standard BH images and slightly lower
edge definition. Quantification of Left Ventricular (LV) and Right Ventricular
(RV) metrics showed excellent correlation between the techniques with narrow
limits of agreement. However, we observed small but statistically significant
overestimation of LV end-diastolic volume, underestimation of LV end-systolic
volume, as well as a small overestimation of RV stroke volume and ejection
fraction using the RT imaging technique. No difference in inter-observer or
intra-observer variability were observed between the BH and RT sequences.
  Conclusions: Real-time bSSFP imaging using spiral trajectories combined with
a compressed sensing reconstruction is feasible. The main benefit is that it
can be acquired during free breathing. However, another important secondary
benefit is that a whole ventricular stack can be acquired in ~20 seconds, as
opposed to ~6 minutes for standard BH imaging. Thus, this technique holds the
potential to significantly shorten MR scan times in children.

the choice of the source node affect the prevalence of a diffusion process. In
this work, we addressed the further question: node pairs with what kind of
local and temporal connection features tend to appear in a diffusion trajectory
or path, thus contribute to the actual information diffusion. We consider the
Susceptible-Infected spreading process with a given infection probability per
contact on a large number of real-world temporal networks. We illustrate how to
construct the information diffusion backbone where the weight of each link
tells the probability that a node pair appears in a diffusion process starting
from a random node. We unravel how these backbones corresponding to different
infection probabilities relate to each other and point out the importance of
two extreme backbones: the backbone with infection probability one and the
integrated network, between which other backbones vary. We find that the
temporal node pair feature that we proposed could better predict the links in
the extreme backbone with infection probability one as well as the high weight
links than the features derived from the integrated network. This universal
finding across all the empirical networks highlights that temporal information
are crucial in determining a node pair's role in a diffusion process. A node
pair with many early contacts tends to appear in a diffusion process. Our
findings shed lights on the in-depth understanding and may inspire the control

approximation of linear partial differential equation (PDE) problems in weak
formulation. We consider approximation methods in fully discrete formulation,
where the discrete and continuous spaces are possibly not embedded in a common
space. A proper notion of consistency is designed, and, under a classical
inf-sup condition, it is shown to bound the approximation error. This error
estimate result is in the spirit of Strang's first and second lemmas, but
applicable in situations not covered by these lemmas (because of a fully
discrete approximation space). An improved estimate is also established in a
weaker norm, using the Aubin--Nitsche trick.
  We then apply these abstract estimates to an anisotropic heterogeneous
diffusion model and two classical families of schemes for this model: Virtual
Element and Finite Volume methods. For each of these methods, we show that the
abstract results yield new error estimates with a precise and mild dependency
on the local anisotropy ratio. A key intermediate step to derive such estimates
for Virtual Element Methods is proving optimal approximation properties of the
oblique elliptic projector in weighted Sobolev seminorms. This is a result
whose interest goes beyond the specific model and methods considered here. We
also obtain, to our knowledge, the first clear notion of consistency for Finite
Volume methods, which leads to a generic error estimate involving the fluxes
and valid for a wide range of Finite Volume schemes. An important application
is the first error estimate for Multi-Point Flux Approximation L and G methods.
  In the appendix, not included in the published version of this work, we show
that classical estimates for discontinuous Galerkin methods can be obtained

spin injection/detection with 1D edge contacts, a spurious magnetoresistance
signal was observed, which is found to originate from the local Hall effect in
graphene due to fringe fields from ferromagnetic edge contacts and in the
presence of charge current spreading in the nonlocal measurement configuration.
Such behavior has been confirmed by the absence of a Hanle signal and
gate-dependent magnetoresistance measurements that reveal a change in sign of
the signal for the electron- and hole-doped regimes, which is in contrast to
the expected behavior of the spin signal. Calculations show that the
contact-induced fringe fields are typically on the order of hundreds of mT, but
can be reduced below 100 mT with careful optimization of the contact geometry.
There may be additional contribution from magnetoresistance effects due to
tunneling anisotropy in the contacts, which need to be further investigated.
These studies are useful for optimization of spin injection and detection in 2D

propagation problems, complex surface topography is either accounted for by
boundary-fitted unstructured meshes, or, where possible, by mapping the complex
computational domain from physical space to a topologically simple domain in a
reference coordinate system. In this paper we propose a completely different
strategy. We address the problem of geometrically complex free surface boundary
conditions with a novel diffuse interface method on adaptive Cartesian meshes
that consists in the introduction of a characteristic function $
0\leq\alpha\leq 1$ which identifies the location of the solid medium and the
surrounding air and thus implicitly defines the location of the free surface
boundary. Our new approach completely avoids the problem of mesh generation,
since all that is needed for the definition of the complex surface topography
is to set a scalar color function to unity inside the regions covered by the
solid and to zero outside. An analysis of the eigenvalues of the PDE system
shows that the complexity of the geometry has no influence on the admissible
time step size due to the CFL condition. The model reduces to the classical
linear elasticity equations inside the solid medium where the gradients of
$\alpha$ are zero, while in the diffuse interface zone at the free surface
boundary the governing PDE system becomes nonlinear. We can prove that the
solution of the Riemann problem with arbitrary data and a jump in $\alpha$ from
unity to zero yields a Godunov-state at the interface that satisfies the
free-surface boundary condition exactly. In order to reduce numerical
dissipation, we use high order DG finite element schemes on adaptive AMR grids
together with a high resolution shock capturing subcell finite volume (FV)
limiter in the diffuse interface region.

transform (SIFT) usually use image intensity or gradient information to detect
and describe feature points; however, both intensity and gradient are sensitive
to nonlinear radiation distortions (NRD). To solve the problem, this paper
proposes a novel feature matching algorithm that is robust to large NRD. The
proposed method is called radiation-invariant feature transform (RIFT). There
are three main contributions in RIFT: first, RIFT uses phase congruency (PC)
instead of image intensity for feature point detection. RIFT considers both the
number and repeatability of feature points, and detects both corner points and
edge points on the PC map. Second, RIFT originally proposes a maximum index map
(MIM) for feature description. MIM is constructed from the log-Gabor
convolution sequence and is much more robust to NRD than traditional gradient
map. Thus, RIFT not only largely improves the stability of feature detection,
but also overcomes the limitation of gradient information for feature
description. Third, RIFT analyzes the inherent influence of rotations on the
values of MIM, and realizes rotation invariance. We use six different types of
multi-model image datasets to evaluate RIFT, including optical-optical,
infrared-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical, depth-optical,
map-optical, and day-night datasets. Experimental results show that RIFT is
much more superior to SIFT and SAR-SIFT. To the best of our knowledge, RIFT is
the first feature matching algorithm that can achieve good performance on all
the above-mentioned types of multi-model images. The source code of RIFT and
multi-modal remote sensing image datasets are made public .

Decomposition (SVD) to tensors, the higher dimensional analogues of matrices.
We study the problem of constructing the Tucker decomposition of sparse tensors
on distributed memory systems via the HOOI procedure, a popular iterative
method. The scheme used for distributing the input tensor among the processors
(MPI ranks) critically influences the HOOI execution time. Prior work has
proposed different distribution schemes: an offline scheme based on
sophisticated hypergraph partitioning method and simple, lightweight
alternatives that can be used real-time. While the hypergraph based scheme
typically results in faster HOOI execution time, being complex, the time taken
for determining the distribution is an order of magnitude higher than the
execution time of a single HOOI iteration. Our main contribution is a
lightweight distribution scheme, which achieves the best of both worlds. We
show that the scheme is near-optimal on certain fundamental metrics associated
with the HOOI procedure and as a result, near-optimal on the computational load
(FLOPs). Though the scheme may incur higher communication volume, the
computation time is the dominant factor and as the result, the scheme achieves
better performance on the overall HOOI execution time. Our experimental
evaluation on large real-life tensors (having up to 4 billion elements) shows
that the scheme outperforms the prior schemes on the HOOI execution time by a
factor of up to 3x. On the other hand, its distribution time is comparable to
the prior lightweight schemes and is typically lesser than the execution time
of a single HOOI iteration.

combines a chiral symmetry with a previously unexplored unitary version of
supersymmetry. Having experimental access to the position and coin state of the
walker, we perform a full polarization tomography and provide evidence for the
predicted anomaly of the midgap states. This approach opens the prospect to
distill topological states dynamically for classical and quantum information

factorization of a time-frequency (t-f) transform. In particular, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF) of the spectrogram has been considered in many audio
applications. This is an analysis approach in the sense that the factorization
is applied to the squared magnitude of the analysis coefficients returned by
the t-f transform. In this paper we instead propose a synthesis approach, where
low-rankness is imposed to the synthesis coefficients of the data signal over a
given t-f dictionary (such as a Gabor frame). As such we offer a novel modeling
paradigm that bridges t-f synthesis modeling and traditional analysis-based NMF
approaches. The proposed generative model allows in turn to design more
sophisticated multi-layer representations that can efficiently capture diverse
forms of structure. Additionally, the generative modeling allows to exploit t-f
low-rankness for compressive sensing. We present efficient iterative shrinkage
algorithms to perform estimation in the proposed models and illustrate the
capabilities of the new modeling paradigm over audio signal processing
examples.

satellite lies on a quadratic surface. This constant of motion is then used to
detect the gyroscope faults and estimate the corresponding scale factor or bias
values of the rate gyros of the primary satellite. The proposed algorithm works
even in time variant fault situations as well, and does not impose any
additional subsystems to formation flying satellites. Monte-Carlo simulations
are used to ensure that the algorithm retains its performance in the presence
of uncertainties. In presence of only measurement noise, the isolation process
performs well by selecting a proper threshold. However, the isolation
performance degrades as the scale factor approaches unity or bias approaches
zero. Finally, the effect of orbital perturbations on isolation process is
investigated by including the effect of zonal harmonics as well as drag and

performance of quantum technologies; however, such a task cannot always be
accomplished with certainty. Here we develop a general framework of
probabilistic distillation of quantum coherence in a one-shot setting,
establishing fundamental limitations for different classes of free operations.
We first provide a geometric interpretation for the maximal success
probability, showing that under maximally incoherent operations (MIO) and
dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO) the problem can be simplified
into efficiently computable semidefinite programs. Exploiting these results, we
find that DIO and its subset of strictly incoherent operations (SIO) have equal
power in probabilistic distillation of coherence from pure input states, while
MIO are strictly stronger. We then prove a fundamental no-go result: distilling
coherence from any full-rank state is impossible even probabilistically. We
further find that in some conditions the maximal success probability can vanish
suddenly beyond a certain threshold in the distillation fidelity. Finally, we
consider probabilistic coherence distillation assisted by a catalyst and
demonstrate, with specific examples, its superiority to the unassisted and
deterministic cases.

Thus, the generator is trained to generate sample pairs from which a designed

propose a disentanglement metric called the subspace score, which is inspired

subsequently developed further to discuss various reconstructions that silicene
acquires due to interactions with the substrate and how such effects are
mirrored in the electronic properties. Next the book examines the dumbbell

decade, by academia and industry alike, thanks to their capacity-achieving
error-correction performance and low-complexity decoding algorithms. Recently,
they have been selected as one of the coding schemes in the $5^{th}$ generation
wireless standard (5G). Over the years various polar code decoding algorithms,
like SC-list (SCL), have been proposed to improve the mediocre performance of
the successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm for finite code lengths;
however, like SC, they suffer from long decoding latency. Fast decoding of
polar codes tries to overcome this problem by identifying particular subcodes
in the polar code and decoding them with efficient decoders. In this work, we
introduce a generalized approach to fast decoding of polar codes to further
reduce SC-based decoding latency. We propose three multi-node polar code
subcodes whose identification patterns include most of the existing subcodes,
extending them to SCL decoding, and allow to apply fast decoding to larger
subsets of bits. Without any error-correction performance degradation, the
proposed technique shows up to $23.6\%$ and $29.2\%$ decoding latency gain with
respect to fast SC and SCL decoding algorithms, respectively, and up to

The highest sensitivity is exhibited by quantities influenced by properties of

high sensitivity of graphene to the local environment has shown to be both
advantageous but also problematic for graphene-based devices, such as
transistors and sensors, where the graphene carrier concentration and mobility
change due to ambient humidity variations. In this review, recent progress in
understanding the effects of water on different types of graphene, grown
epitaxially and quasi-free standing on SiC, by chemical vapour deposition on
SiO2, as well as exfoliated flakes, are presented. It is demonstrated that
water withdraws electrons from graphene, but the graphene-water interaction
highly depends on the thickness, layer stacking, underlying substrate and
substrate-induced doping. Moreover, we highlight the importance of clear and
unambiguous description of the environmental conditions (i.e. relative
humidity) whenever a routine characterisation for carrier concentration and
mobility is reported (often presented as a simple figure-of-merit), as these
electrical characteristics are highly dependent on the adsorbed molecules and
the surrounding environment.

theory, which has seen a revival in recent years. The approach is to understand
second-order set theory by studying the structure of models of second-order set
theories. The main results are the following, organized by chapter. First, I
investigate the poset of $T$-realizations of a fixed countable model of
$\mathsf{ZFC}$, where $T$ is a reasonable second-order set theory such as
$\mathsf{GBC}$ or $\mathsf{KM}$, showing that it has a rich structure. In
particular, every countable partial order embeds into this structure. Moreover,
we can arrange so that these embedding preserve the existence/nonexistence of
upper bounds, at least for finite partial orders. Second I generalize some
constructions of Marek and Mostowski from $\mathsf{KM}$ to weaker theories.
They showed that every model of $\mathsf{KM}$ plus the Class Collection schema
""unrolls"" to a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}^-$ with a largest cardinal. I calculate
the theories of the unrolling for a variety of second-order set theories, going
as weak as $\mathsf{GBC} + \mathsf{ETR}$. I also show that being $T$-realizable
goes down to submodels for a broad selection of second-order set theories $T$.
Third, I show that there is a hierarchy of transfinite recursion principles
ranging in strength from $\mathsf{GBC}$ to $\mathsf{KM}$. This hierarchy is
ordered first by the complexity of the properties allowed in the recursions and
second by the allowed heights of the recursions. Fourth, I investigate the
question of which second-order set theories have least models. I show that
strong theories---such as $\mathsf{KM}$ or $\Pi^1_1\text{-}\mathsf{CA}$---do
not have least transitive models while weaker theories---from $\mathsf{GBC}$ to
$\mathsf{GBC} + \mathsf{ETR}_\mathrm{Ord}$---do have least transitive models.

Instead, our method takes advantage of subarray datatypes and generalized

Despite generalized all-to-all communication of discontiguous data being

apply to any global redistribution, over any two directions of a

high-carrier densities. We first determine the in-plane spin lifetime by
conventional spin precession measurements with magnetic fields perpendicular to
the graphene plane. Then, to evaluate the out-of-plane spin lifetime, we
implement spin precession measurements under oblique magnetic fields that
generate an out-of-plane spin population. We find that the spin-lifetime
anisotropy of graphene on silicon oxide is independent of carrier density and
temperature down to 150 K, and much weaker than previously reported. Indeed,
within the experimental uncertainty, the spin relaxation is isotropic.
Altogether with the gate dependence of the spin lifetime, this indicates that
the spin relaxation is driven by magnetic impurities or random spin-orbit or
gauge fields.

can be advantageous in terms of robustness to environmental changes and
differences in illumination. This paper presents SegMap: a map representation
solution to the localization and mapping problem based on the extraction of
segments in 3D point clouds. In addition to facilitating the computationally
intensive task of processing 3D point clouds, working at the level of segments
addresses the data compression requirements of real-time single- and
multi-robot systems. While current methods extract descriptors for the single
task of localization, SegMap leverages a data-driven descriptor in order to
extract meaningful features that can also be used for reconstructing a dense 3D
map of the environment and for extracting semantic information. This is
particularly interesting for navigation tasks and for providing visual feedback
to end-users such as robot operators, for example in search and rescue
scenarios. These capabilities are demonstrated in multiple urban driving and
search and rescue experiments. Our method leads to an increase of area under
the ROC curve of 28.3% over current state of the art using eigenvalue based
features. We also obtain very similar reconstruction capabilities to a model
specifically trained for this task. The SegMap implementation will be made

components, the space $\mathfrak{g}$ spanned by free homotopy classes of loops
in $\Sigma$ carries the structure of a Lie bialgebra. The Lie bracket was
defined by Goldman and it is canonical. The Lie cobracket was defined by Turaev
and it depends on the framing of $\Sigma$. The Lie bialgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ has
a natural decreasing filtration such that both the Goldman bracket and the
Turaev cobracket have degree $(-2)$.
  In this paper, we address the following Goldman-Turaev formality problem:
construct a Lie bialgebra homomorphism $\theta$ from $\mathfrak{g}$ to its
associated graded $gr\, \mathfrak{g}$ such that $gr\, \theta = {\rm id}$. In
order to solve it, we define a family of higher genus Kashiwara-Vergne (KV)
problems for an element $F\in Aut(L)$, where $L$ is a free Lie algebra. In the
case of $g=0$ and $n=2$, the problem for $F$ is the classical KV problem from
Lie theory. For $g>0$, these KV problems are new.
  Our main results are as follows. On the one hand, every solution of the KV
problem induces a GT formality map. On the other hand, higher genus KV problems
admit solutions for any $g$ and $n$. In fact, the solution reduces to two
important cases: $g=0, n=2$ which admits solutions by Alekseev and Torossian
and $g=1, n=1$ for which we construct solutions in terms of certain elliptic
associators following Enriquez. By combining these two results, we obtain a
proof of the GT formality for any $g$ and $n$.
  We also study the set of solutions of higher genus KV problems and introduce
pro-unipotent groups $KRV^{(g,n+1)}$ which act on them freely and transitively.
These groups admit graded pro-nilpotent Lie algebras $krv^{(g, n+1)}$. We show
that the elliptic Lie algebra $krv^{(1,1)}$ contains a copy of the
Grothendieck-Teichmuller Lie algebra $grt_1$ as well as symplectic derivations
$\delta_{2n}$.

theoretical tool, which allows to describe the electronic structure,
spectroscopy and dynamics of strongly correlated systems. The applicability of
this method is, however, limited by its considerable computational cost. Due to
the treatment of the full two-time dependence of the NEGF the underlying
equations of motion involve a long-lasting non-Markovian memory kernel that
results in at least a $N^3_t$ scaling in the number of time points $N_t$. The
system's memory time is, however, reduced in the presence of a thermalizing
bath. In particular, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) -- one of the most
successful approaches to strongly correlated lattice systems - maps extended
systems to an effective impurity coupled to a bath. In this work, we
systematically investigate how the memory time can be truncated in
nonequilibrium DMFT simulations of the Hubbard and Hubbard-Holstein model. We
show that suitable truncation schemes, which substantially reduce the
computational cost, result in excellent approximations to the full time
evolution. This approach enables the propagation to longer times, making
fundamental processes like prethermalization and the final stages of

studies show that deep adversarial domain adaptation models can make markable
improvements in performance, which include symmetric and asymmetric

latter is very hard to train. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial
domain adaptation method named Adversarial Residual Transform Networks (ARTNs)
to improve the generalization ability, which directly transforms the source
features into the space of target features. In this model, residual connections
are used to share features and adversarial loss is reconstructed, thus making
the model more generalized and easier to train. Moreover, a special
regularization term is added to the loss function to alleviate a vanishing
gradient problem, which enables its training process stable. A series of
experiments based on Amazon review dataset, digits datasets and Office-31 image
datasets are conducted to show that the proposed ARTN can be comparable with
the methods of the state-of-the-art.

that they linearly decrease with increas- ing latitudes of the coronal holes.
For coronal holes located at latitudes & 60{\deg}, they turn statistically to
zero, indicating that the associated high-speed streams have a high chance to
miss the Earth. Similar, the Kp index per coronal hole area is highest for the
coronal holes located near the solar equator and strongly decreases with

used as a standard candle for any experiment which aims at measuring the
polarization of the sky. Though its spectral energy distribution has been well
characterized in total intensity, polarization data are still lacking at
millimetre wavelengths. We report in this paper high resolution (18 arcsec
FWHM) observations of the Crab nebula in total intensity and linear
polarization at 150 GHz with the NIKA camera. NIKA, operated at the IRAM 30 m
telescope from 2012 to 2015, is a camera made of Lumped Element Kinetic

compatible with previous observations at lower and higher frequencies.
Averaging across the source and using other existing data sets we find that the
Crab nebula polarization angle is consistent with being constant over a wide

field of precision agriculture has demonstrated the need to produce temporally
consistent imagery to allow for quantitative comparisons. In order for these
aerial images to be used to identify actual changes on the ground, conversion
of raw digital count to reflectance, or to an atmospherically normalized space,
needs to be carried out. This paper will describe an experiment that compares
the use of reflectance calibration panels, for use with the empirical line
method (ELM), against a newly proposed ratio of the target radiance and the
downwelling radiance, to predict the reflectance of known targets in the scene.
We propose that the use of an on-board downwelling light sensor (DLS) may
provide the sUAS remote sensing practitioner with an approach that does not
require the expensive and time consuming task of placing known reflectance
standards in the scene. Three calibration methods were tested in this study:
2-Point ELM, 1-Point ELM, and At-altitude Radiance Ratio (AARR). Our study
indicates that the traditional 2-Point ELM produces the lowest mean error in
band effective reflectance factor, 0.0165. The 1-Point ELM and AARR produce
mean errors of 0.0343 and 0.0287 respectively. A modeling of the proposed AARR
approach indicates that the technique has the potential to perform better than
the 2-Point ELM method, with a 0.0026 mean error in band effective reflectance
factor, indicating that this newly proposed technique may prove to be a viable
alternative with suitable on-board sensors.

analysis is made looking for the presence of nonlinearities in an early phase

data. 2) Next it is studied if it is safe to use a linear system identification

properties of the linear system identification approach under these conditions
are studied, and the reliability of the uncertainty bounds is checked. 3)
Eventually, tools are provided to check how much can be gained if a nonlinear

  Addressing these three questions forms the outline of this article. The
possibilities and pitfalls of using a linear identification framework in the
presence of nonlinear distortions will be discussed and illustrated on
lab-scale and industrial examples.
  In this article, the focus is on nonparametric and parametric black box
identification methods, however the results might also be useful for physical
modeling methods. Knowing the actual nonlinear distortion level can help to
choose the required level of detail that is needed in the physical model. This
will strongly influence the modeling effort. Also, in this case, significant
time can be saved if it is known from experiments that the system behaves
almost linearly. The converse is also true. If the experiments show that some
(sub-)systems are highly nonlinear, it helps to focus the physical modeling
effort on these critical elements.

applications. Radio-based activity recognition has the advantage that it does
not have the privacy concern and the subjects do not have to carry a device on
them. Recently, it has been shown channel state information (CSI) can be used
for activity recognition in a device-free setting. With the proliferation of
wireless devices, it is important to understand how radio frequency
interference (RFI) can impact on pervasive computing applications. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of RFI on device-free CSI-based
location-oriented activity recognition. We present data to show that RFI can
have a significant impact on the CSI vectors. In the absence of RFI, different
activities give rise to different CSI vectors that can be differentiated
visually. However, in the presence of RFI, the CSI vectors become much noisier
and activity recognition also becomes harder. Our extensive experiments show
that the performance of state-of-the-art classification methods may degrade
significantly with RFI. We then propose a number of counter measures to
mitigate the impact of RFI and improve the location-oriented activity
recognition performance. We are also the first to use complex-valued CSI to
improve the performance in the environment with RFI.

economic value of any future study with a specific design aimed at reducing
uncertainty in a health economic model. This has potential as a tool for trial
design; the cost and value of different designs could be compared to find the
trial with the greatest net benefit. However, despite recent developments, EVSI
analysis can be slow especially when optimising over a large number of
different designs. Methods: This paper develops a method to reduce the
computation time required to calculate the EVSI across different sample sizes.
Our method extends the moment matching approach to EVSI estimation to optimise
over different sample sizes for the underlying trial with a similar
computational cost to a single EVSI estimate. This extension calculates
posterior variances across the alternative sample sizes and then uses Bayesian
non-linear regression to calculate the EVSI. Results: A health economic model
developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions for chronic pain
demonstrates that this EVSI calculation method is fast and accurate for
realistic models. This example also highlights how different trial designs can
be compared using the EVSI. Conclusion: The proposed estimation method is fast
and accurate when calculating the EVSI across different sample sizes. This will
allow researchers to realise the potential of using the EVSI to determine an
economically optimal trial design for reducing uncertainty in health economic
models. Limitations: Our method relies on some additional simulation, which can
be expensive in models with very large computational cost.

of these planetary systems, guided by the computation of planar families of
periodic orbits and the bifurcation of families of spatial periodic orbits. We
show that inclination excitation at small to moderate eccentricities can be

proximity of the non-coplanar systems to spatial periodic orbits contributes to
maintaining their mutual inclination over long periods of time.

estimates of red giant stars from a combination of astrometric, photometric,
and spectroscopic data. The core of the approach is a Bayesian artificial
neural network (ANN) that learns from and completely replaces stellar
isochrones. The ANN is trained using a sample of red giant stars with mass
estimates from asteroseismology. A Bayesian isochrone pipeline uses the
astrometric, photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismology data to determine
posterior distributions for the training outputs: mass, age, and distance.
Given new inputs, posterior predictive distributions for the outputs are
computed, taking into account both input uncertainties, and uncertainties in
the ANN parameters.
  We apply MADE to $\sim10\,000$ red giants in the overlap between the
14$^{\mathrm{th}}$ data release from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE, Abolfathi et al. 2018) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS,
Michalik et al. 2015). The ANN is able to reduce the uncertainty on mass, age,
and distance estimates for training-set stars with high output uncertainties
allocated through the Bayesian isochrone pipeline. The fractional uncertainties
on mass are $<10\%$ and on age are between $10$ to $25\%$. Moreover, the time
taken for our ANN to predict masses, ages, and distances for the entire
catalogue of APOGEE-TGAS stars is of a similar order of the time taken by the
Bayesian isochrone pipeline to run on a handful of stars. Our resulting
catalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick and thin disc components in
the [M/H]-[$\alpha$/M] plane, when examined by age.

reported in this study, we could detect the locations of these planes based on
the microstructural features examined in SEM and TEM. This strengthens the
concept of the physicochemical approach that relates microstructural evolution
with the diffusion rates of components and imparts finer understanding of the
growth mechanism of phases. The estimated diffusion coefficients at the
Kirkendall marker planes indicates that the reason for the growth of the
Kirkendall voids is the nonconsumption of excess vacancies which are generated
due to unequal diffusion rate of components. Systematic experiments using
different purity of Cu in this study indicates the importance of the presence
of impurities on the growth of voids, which increases drastically for greather
than 0.1 wt percent impurity. The growth of voids increases drastically for
electroplated Cu, commercially pure Cu and Cu(0.5 at percent Ni) indicating the
adverse role of both inorganic and organic impurities. Void size and number
distribution analysis indicates the nucleation of new voids along with the
growth of existing voids with the increase in annealing time. The newly found
location of the Kirkendall marker plane in the Cu3Sn phase indicates that voids
grow on both the sides of this plane which was not considered earlier for

generators poses additional challenges to gas network operators, mainly because
they can induce rapid changes in the demand. This paper presents an efficient
minimization scheme of gas compression costs under dynamic conditions where
deliveries to customers are described by time-dependent mass flows. The
optimization scheme is comprised of a set of transient nonlinear partial
differential equations that model the isothermal gas flow in pipes, an adjoint
problem for efficient calculation of the objective gradients and constraint
Jacobians, and state-of-the-art optimal control methods for solving nonlinear
programs. As the evaluation of constraint Jacobians can become computationally
costly as the number of constraints increases, efficient constraint lumping
schemes are proposed and investigated with respect to accuracy and performance.
The resulting optimal control problems are solved using both interior-point and
sequential quadratic programming methods. The proposed optimization framework
is validated through several benchmark cases of increasing complexity.

  Workshop [cleaned up source files]",,,,"eess.AS cs.CR cs.SD stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ASVspoof challenge series was born to spearhead research in anti-spoofing
for automatic speaker verification (ASV). The two challenge editions in 2015
and 2017 involved the assessment of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) in isolation
from ASV using an equal error rate (EER) metric. While a strategic approach to
assessment at the time, it has certain shortcomings. First, the CM EER is not
necessarily a reliable predictor of performance when ASV and CMs are combined.
Second, the EER operating point is ill-suited to user authentication
applications, e.g. telephone banking, characterised by a high target user prior
but a low spoofing attack prior. We aim to migrate from CM- to ASV-centric
assessment with the aid of a new tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) metric.
It extends the conventional DCF used in ASV research to scenarios involving
spoofing attacks. The t-DCF metric has 6 parameters: (i) false alarm and miss
costs for both systems, and (ii) prior probabilities of target and spoof trials
(with an implied third, nontarget prior). The study is intended to serve as a
self-contained, tutorial-like presentation. We analyse with the t-DCF a
selection of top-performing CM submissions to the 2015 and 2017 editions of
ASVspoof, with a focus on the spoofing attack prior. Whereas there is little to
choose between countermeasure systems for lower priors, system rankings derived
with the EER and t-DCF show differences for higher priors. We observe some
ranking changes. Findings support the adoption of the DCF-based metric into the
roadmap for future ASVspoof challenges, and possibly for other biometric
anti-spoofing evaluations.

  Decomposition","16 Pages, Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2018",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tensor decompositions are used in various data mining applications from
social network to medical applications and are extremely useful in discovering
latent structures or concepts in the data. Many real-world applications are
dynamic in nature and so are their data. To deal with this dynamic nature of
data, there exist a variety of online tensor decomposition algorithms. A
central assumption in all those algorithms is that the number of latent
concepts remains fixed throughout the entire stream. However, this need not be
the case. Every incoming batch in the stream may have a different number of
latent concepts, and the difference in latent concepts from one tensor batch to
another can provide insights into how our findings in a particular application
behave and deviate over time. In this paper, we define ""concept"" and ""concept
drift"" in the context of streaming tensor decomposition, as the manifestation
of the variability of latent concepts throughout the stream. Furthermore, we
introduce SeekAndDestroy, an algorithm that detects concept drift in streaming
tensor decomposition and is able to produce results robust to that drift. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates concept
drift in streaming tensor decomposition. We extensively evaluate SeekAndDestroy
on synthetic datasets, which exhibit a wide variety of realistic drift. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SeekAndDestroy, both in the
detection of concept drift and in the alleviation of its effects, producing
results with similar quality to decomposing the entire tensor in one shot.
Additionally, in real datasets, SeekAndDestroy outperforms other streaming
baselines, while discovering novel useful components.

dissipation of conventional MOS devices, a minimum increase of the gate
voltage, i.e. 60 mV, is required for a 10-fold increase in drain-to-source
current at 300 K. Negative Capacitance (NC) in ferroelectric materials is
proposed in order to address this physical limitation of CMOS technology. A
polarization destabilization in ferroelectrics causes an effective negative
permittivity, resulting in a differential voltage amplification and a reduced
subthreshold swing when integrated into the gate stack of a transistor. Recent
demonstrations of negative capacitance concerned mainly n-type MOSFETs and
their subthreshold slope. An effective technology booster should be capable of
improving the performance of both n- and p-type transistors. In this work, we
report a significant enhancement in both digital (subthreshold swing,
on-current over off-current ratio, and overdrive) and analog (transconductance
and current efficiency factor) FoM of commercial 28nm CMOS process by
exploiting a PZT capacitor as the negative capacitance booster. Accordingly, a
sub-thermal swing down to 10 mV/decade together with an enhanced current
efficiency factor up to 10$^5$ V$^{-1}$ is obtained in both n- and p-type
MOSFETs at room temperature. The overdrive voltage is enhanced up to 0.45 V,
leading to a supply voltage reduction of 50\%.

separated by a non-magnetic interlayer, which results in four stable magnetic
states: +/-ferromagnetic (FM) and +/-antiferromagnetic (A-FM). Direct
visualisation of the stray field surrounding the probe apex using electron
holography convincingly demonstrates a striking difference in the spatial
distribution and strength of the magnetic flux in FM and A-FM states. In situ
MFM studies of reference samples are used to determine the probe switching
fields and spatial resolution. Furthermore, quantitative values of the probe
magnetic moments are obtained by determining their real space tip transfer
function (RSTTF). We also map the local Hall voltage in graphene Hall
nanosensors induced by the probes in different states. The measured transport
properties of nanosensors and RSTTF outcomes are introduced as an input in a
numerical model of Hall devices to verify the probe magnetic moments. The
modelling results fully match the experimental measurements, outlining an

Kretschmann scalar is finite, and the metric approaches conformal-flatness in
the ultraviolet regime where the non-local gravitational interaction becomes
important. We will show that the metric potentials are bounded below one as
long as two conditions involving the mass and the electric charge are
satisfied. Furthermore, we will argue that the cosmic censorship conjecture is
not required in this case. Unlike in the case of Reissner-Nordstr\""om in
general relativity, where $|Q|\leq m/M_p$ has to be always satisfied, in {\it
ghost-free} infinite derivative gravity $|Q|>m/M_p$ is also allowed, such as
for an electron.

elementary aspects of projective geometry. We use a flexible approach in which
no a priori assignment of an electrical nature to the circuit branches is
necessary. Such an assignment is eventually done just by setting certain model
parameters, in a way which avoids the need for a distinction between voltage
and current sources and, additionally, makes it possible to get rid of voltage-
or current-control assumptions on the impedances. This paves the way for a
completely general $m$-dimensional reduction of any circuit defined by $m$
two-terminal, uncoupled linear elements, contrary to most classical methods
which at one step or another impose certain restrictions on the allowed
devices. The reduction has the form $$\begin{pmatrix} AP \\ BQ \end{pmatrix} u
= \begin{pmatrix} AQ \\ -BP \end{pmatrix} \bar{s}.$$ Here, $A$ and $B$ capture
the graph topology, whereas $P$, $Q$, $\bar{s}$ comprise homogeneous
descriptions of all the circuit elements; the unknown $u$ is an $m$-dimensional
vector of (say) ``seed'' variables from which currents and voltages are
obtained as $i=Pu -Q\bar{s}$, $v=Qu + P\bar{s}$. Computational implementations
are straightforward. These models allow for a general characterization of
non-degenerate configurations in terms of the multihomogeneous Kirchhoff
polynomial, and in this direction we present some results of independent
interest involving the matrix-tree theorem. Our approach can be easily combined
with classical methods by using homogeneous descriptions only for certain
branches, yielding partially homogeneous models. We also indicate how to
accommodate controlled sources and coupled devices in the homogeneous

complex molecular machinery to convert solar energy into biochemical fuel. An
important common feature shared by most of these photosynthetic organisms is
that they capture photons in the form of excitons typically delocalized over a
few to tens of pigment molecules embedded in protein environments of light
harvesting complexes (LHCs). Delocalized excitons created in such LHCs remain
well protected despite being swayed by environmental fluctuations, and are
delivered successfully to their destinations over hundred nanometer length
scale distances in about hundred picosecond time scales. Decades of
experimental and theoretical investigation have produced a large body of
information offering insights into major structural, energetic, and dynamical
features contributing to LHCs' extraordinary capability to harness photons
using delocalized excitons. The objective of this review is (i) to provide a
comprehensive account of major theoretical, computational, and spectroscopic
advances that have contributed to this body of knowledge, and (ii) to clarify
the issues concerning the role of delocalized excitons in achieving efficient
energy transport mechanisms. The focus of this review is on three

light harvesting 2 complex of purple bacteria, and phycobiliproteins of
cryptophyte algae. Although we offer more in-depth and detailed description of
theoretical and computational aspects, major experimental results and their
implications are also assessed in the context of achieving excellent light
harvesting functionality. Future theoretical and experimental challenges to be

diffusion properties of spectral element methods for linear
convection-diffusion systems. While strictly speaking only valid for linear
problems, the analysis is devised so that it can give critical insights on two
questions: (i) Why do spectral element methods suffer from stability issues in
under-resolved computations of nonlinear problems? And, (ii) why do they
successfully predict under-resolved turbulent flows even without a
subgrid-scale model? The answer to these two questions can in turn provide
crucial guidelines to construct more robust and accurate schemes for complex
under-resolved flows, commonly found in industrial applications. For
illustration purposes, this analysis technique is applied to the hybridized
discontinuous Galerkin methods as representatives of spectral element methods.
The effect of the polynomial order, the upwinding parameter and the P\'eclet
number on the so-called \textit{short-term diffusion} of the scheme are
investigated. From a purely non-modal analysis point of view, polynomial orders
between $2$ and $4$ with standard upwinding are well suited for under-resolved
turbulence simulations. For lower polynomial orders, diffusion is introduced in
scales that are much larger than the grid resolution. For higher polynomial
orders, as well as for strong under/over-upwinding, robustness issues can be
expected. The non-modal analysis results are then tested against under-resolved
turbulence simulations of the Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. While
devised in the linear setting, our non-modal analysis succeeds to predict the
behavior of the scheme in the nonlinear problems considered.

$M=\mathbb{R}^d$, $T>0$, and $L:M\times M \to \mathbb{R}$ is a suitable
Lagrangian. We also consider the stochastic counterpart:
\begin{align*}%\tag{$\star$}
\underline{B}_T^s(\mu,\nu):=\inf\left\{\mathbb{E}\left[\langle V,X_0\rangle
+\int_0^T L(t, X,\beta(t,X))\,dt\right]; X\in \mathcal{A}, V\sim\mu,X_T\sim

satisfying $dX=\beta_X(t,X)\,dt+ dW_t,$ for some drift $\beta_X(t,X)$, and
where $W_t$ is $\sigma(X_s:0\le s\le t)$-Brownian motion. While inf-convolution
allows us to easily obtain Hopf-Lax formulas on Wasserstein space for cost
minimizing transports, this is not the case for total cost maximizing
transports, which actually are sup-inf problems. However, in the case where the
Lagrangian $L$ is jointly convex on phase space, Bolza-type dualities --well
known in the deterministic case but novel in the stochastic case--transform
sup-inf problems to sup-sup settings. Hopf-Lax formulas relate optimal
ballistic transports to those associated with dynamic fixed-end transports
studied by Bernard-Buffoni and Fathi-Figalli in the deterministic case, and by
Mikami-Thieullen in the stochastic setting. We also write Eulerian formulations
and point to links with the theory of mean field games.

theory, they can be identified as the linear transformations which keep
invariant the canonical commutation relations characterizing the coordinates
and momenta operators. In this work, the possibility of considering LCTs to be
the elements of a symmetry group for relativistic quantum physics is studied
using the principle of covariance. It is established that Lorentz
transformations and multidimensional Fourier transforms are particular cases of
LCTs and some of the main symmetry groups currently considered in relativistic
theories can be obtained from the contractions of LCTs groups. It is also shown
that a link can be established between a spinorial representation of LCTs and
some properties of elementary fermions. This link leads to a classification
which suggests the existence of sterile neutrinos and the possibility of
describing a generation of fermions with a single field. Some possible
applications of the obtained results are discussed. These results may, in
particular, help in the establishment of a unified theory of fundamental
interactions. Intuitively, LCTs correspond to linear combinations of
energy-momentum and spacetime compatible with the principle of covariance.

D 98, 104026 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevD.98.104026",,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Till now, critical behaviour of Lifshitz black holes, in an extended $P-v$
space, has not been studied, because it is impossible to find an analytical
equation of state, $P=P(v,T)$, for an arbitrary Lifshitz exponent $z$. In this
paper, we adopt a new approach toward thermodynamic phase space and
successfully explore the critical behaviour of $(n+1)$-dimensional Lifshitz
dilaton black holes. For this purpose, we write down the equation of state as
$Q^s=Q^s(T,\Psi)$ with $\Psi=\left({\partial M}/{\partial Q^{s} }\right)_{S,P}$
is the conjugate of $Q^s$ and construct Smarr relation based on this new phase
space as $ M=M(S,Q^{s},P)$, where $s=2p/(2p-1)$ with $p$ is the power of the
power-law Maxwell Lagrangian. We justify such a choice mathematically and show
that with this new phase space, the system admits the critical behaviour and
resembles the Van der Waals fluid system when the cosmological constant
(pressure) is treated as a fixed parameter, while the charge of the system
varies. We obtain Gibbs free energy of the system and find swallow tail shape
in Gibbs diagrams which represents the first order phase transition. Finally,
we calculate the critical exponents and show that although thermodynamic
quantities depend on the metric parameters such as $z$ , $p$ and $n$, the
critical exponents are the same as Van der Walls fluid-gas system. This
alternative viewpoint toward phase space of lifshitz dilaton black hole can be
understood easily since one can imagine such a change for a given single black
hole i.e., acquiring charge which induces the phase transition. Our results
further support the viewpoint suggested in \cite{Dehy}.

scoring. The study examines the practical implications of estimating individual
scores in a paper-and-pencil high-stakes test using 2PL and 3PL models,
specifically whether the principle of consistent order holds when scoring with
IRT. The principle states that student A, who answers the same (or a larger)
number of items of greater difficulty than student B, should outscore B.
Results of analyses conducted using actual scores from the Chilean national
admission test in mathematics indicate the principle does not hold when scoring
with 2PL or 3PL models. Students who answer more items and of greater
difficulty may be assigned lower scores. The findings can be explained by
examining the mathematical models, since estimated ability scores are an
increasing function of the accumulated estimated discriminations for the
correct items, not their difficulty. For high stakes tests the decision to use
complex model should therefore be a matter of serious deliberation for policy
makers and test experts, since fairness and transparency may be compromised.

nanocrafts, and lay the foundations for a first launch to Alpha Centauri within
the next generation. Along the way, the project could generate important
supplementary benefits to solar system exploration. A number of hard
engineering challenges remain to be solved before these missions can become a
reality.
  A system model has been formulated as part of the Starshot systems
engineering work. This paper presents the model and describes how it computes
cost-optimal point designs. Three point designs are computed: A 0.2 c mission
to Alpha Centauri, a 0.01 c solar system precursor mission, and a ground-based
test facility based on a vacuum tunnel. All assume that the photon pressure
from a 1.06 {\mu}m wavelength beam accelerates a circular dielectric sail. The
0.2 c point design assumes \$0.01/W lasers, \$500/m$^2$ optics, and \$50/kWh
energy storage to achieve \$8.0B capital cost for the ground-based beam
director. In contrast, the energy needed to accelerate each sail costs \$6M.
Beam director capital cost is minimized by a 4.1 m diameter sail that is
accelerated for 9 min. The 0.01 c point design assumes \$1/W lasers,
\$10k/m$^2$ optics, and \$100/kWh energy storage to achieve \$517M capital cost
for the beam director and \$8k energy cost to accelerate each 19 cm diameter
sail. The ground-based test facility assumes \$100/W lasers, \$1M/m$^2$ optics,
\$500/kWh energy storage, and \$10k/m vacuum tunnel. To reach 20 km/s, fast
enough to escape the solar system from Earth, takes 0.4 km of vacuum tunnel, 22
kW of lasers, and a 0.6 m diameter telescope, all of which costs \$5M.
  The system model predicts that, ultimately, Starshot can scale to propel
probes faster than 0.9 c.

incorporated into a Cosserat plate. The simulation is based on the mathematical
model for bending of Cosserat elastic plates recently developed by the authors.
The dislocation is modeled by a sequence of domains that converge to the point
of the dislocation and by a residual force distributed around that point. The
resulted plate deformation is calculated using the Finite Element method. We
also discuss a possible effect of the dislocation on a hole incorporated into
the plate.

using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Os L$_{\text{3}}$ edge.
High resolution ($\Delta E \sim$ 56 meV) measurements show that the
well-defined, low energy magnons in the insulating state weaken and dampen upon
approaching the metallic state. Concomitantly, a broad continuum of excitations
develops which is well described by the magnetic fluctuations of a nearly
antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid. By revealing the continuous evolution of the
magnetic quasiparticle spectrum as it changes its character from itinerant to
localized, our results provide unprecedented insight into the nature of the MIT

infrared signal processing. We combine the electro-absorption tunability of
graphene with the high-Q resonance of a Bragg-based Fabry-Perot resonator at
{\lambda}=1550 nm and show that ~100% free-space signal modulation (>50 dB
extinction ratio, <1 dB insertion loss) at high speed (>1 GHz) can always be
achieved independently of graphene quality (mobility), provided the device is
operating in reflection mode and tuned in critical coupling with graphene.
Remarkably, the critical coupling mechanism produces a higher extinction ratio
for lower graphene mobility. We use practical considerations to optimize the
device architecture and operation as a function of graphene mobility. With a
small modification this scheme can be turned into a very sensitive
acousto-absorption modulator with a ~30 dB/{\AA} extinction ratio, or an index
sensor with 10^7 %/RIU sensitivity. These designs can be easily extended
throughout the midIR spectrum by appropriate scaling of layer thicknesses.

further that how the growth rate in plants can impact the information transfer
