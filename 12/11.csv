Zavlanos","Physics-Based Learning for Robotic Environmental Sensing","20 pages, 26 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a physics-based method to learn environmental fields (EFs) using a
mobile robot. Common purely data-driven methods require prohibitively many
measurements to accurately learn such complex EFs. Alternatively, physics-based
models provide global knowledge of EFs but require experimental validation,
depend on uncertain parameters, and are intractable for mobile robots. To
address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian framework to select the most
likely physics-based models of EFs in real-time, from a pool of numerical
solutions generated offline as a function of the uncertain parameters.
Specifically, we focus on turbulent flow fields and utilize Gaussian processes
(GPs) to construct statistical models for them, using the pool of numerical
solutions to inform their prior mean. To incorporate flow measurements into
these GPs, we control a custom-built mobile robot through a sequence of
waypoints that maximize the information content of the measurements. We
experimentally demonstrate that our proposed framework constructs a posterior
distribution of the flow field that better approximates the real flow compared
to the prior numerical solutions and purely data-driven methods.

stochastically by the turbulence. To probe the properties of such relativistic
particles, we perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations to obtain the turbulent
fields generated by the MRI, and calculate orbits of the high-energy particles
using snapshot data of the MRI turbulence. We find that the particle
acceleration is described by a diffusion phenomenon in energy space with a
diffusion coefficient of the hard-sphere type: $D_\epsilon\propto \epsilon^2$,
where $\epsilon$ is the particle energy. Eddies in the largest scale of the
turbulence play a dominant role in the acceleration process. On the other hand,
the stochastic behaviour in configuration space is not usual diffusion but
superdiffusion: the radial displacement increases with time faster than that in
the normal diffusion. Also, the magnetic field configuration in the hot
accretion flow creates outward bulk motion of high-energy particles. This bulk
motion is more effective than the diffusive motion for higher energy particles.
Our results imply that typical active galactic nuclei that host hot accretion
flows can accelerate CRs up to $\epsilon\sim 0.1-10$ PeV.

open quantum systems is presented. It is based on identification of a parameter
which is uniformly small on wide time intervals: the occupation of the virtual
cloud of quanta. By ""virtual"" we denote those bath excitations which were
emitted by the system, but eventually will be reabsorbed before any measurement
of the bath state. A favourable property of the virtual cloud is that the
number of its quanta is expected to saturate on long times, since physically
this cloud is a (retarded) polarization of the bath around the system.
Therefore, the joint state of open system and of virtual cloud (the dressed
state) can be accurately represented in a truncated basis of Fock states, on a
wide time scale. At the same time, there can be arbitrarily large number of
observable quanta, especially if the open system is under driving. However, by
employing a Monte Carlo sampling of the measurement outcomes of the bath, we
can simulate the dynamics of the observable quantum field. In this work we
consider the measurement with respect to the coherent states, which yields the
Husimi function as the positive (quasi)probability distribution of the
outcomes. The evolution of dressed state which corresponds to a particular
fixed outcome is called the dressed qauntum trajectory. Therefore, the Monte
Carlo sampling of these trajectories yields a stochastic simulation method with
promising convergence properties on wide time scales.

detailed chemical mechanisms to flow solvers is computationally expensive and
often limits their application to 1D simulations. We develop an efficient
Lagrangian diffusive reactor moving along the streamlines of a baseline flow
simulation to compute detailed thermochemical effects. In addition to its
efficiency, the method allows us to model both continuum and rarefied flows,
while including mass and energy diffusion. The Lagrangian solver is assessed
for several testcases including strong normal shockwaves, as well as 2D
axisymmetric blunt-body hypersonic rarefied flows. In all the testcases
performed, the Lagrangian reactor improves drastically the baseline
simulations. The computational cost of a Lagrangian recomputation is typically
orders of magnitude smaller with respect to a full solution of the problem. The
solver has the additional benefit of being immune from statistical noise, which
strongly affects the accuracy of DSMC simulations, especially considering minor

convergence of stagewise training than the vanilla SGD under the PL condition

deep residual networks exhibits that it satisfies one type of non-convexity

the pressure only. Here we construct second order approximations for hybrid
meshes in two and three space dimensions which, similar to the method of
Wheeler and Yotov, allows the local elimination of the flux variables. A full
convergence analysis of the method is given for which new arguments and, in
part, also new quadrature rules and finite elements are required. Computational
tests are presented for illustration of the theoretical results.

primary care for patients with Diabetes to allow rapid prototyping and
assessment of models before pilot implementation. We replicated four outcomes
from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Federally Qualified Health
Center Advanced Primary Care Practice pilot. The DES model simulates a
synthetic population's healthcare experience, including symptom onset,
appointment scheduling, screening, and treatment, as well as the impact of
physician training. A network of detailed event modules was developed from
peer-reviewed literature. Synthetic patients' attributes modify the probability
distributions for event outputs and direct them through an episode of care;
attributes are in turn modified by patients' experiences. Our model replicates
the direction of the effect of physician training on the selected outcomes, and
the strength of the effect increases with the number of trainings. The
simulated effect strength replicates the pilot results for eye exams and
nephropathy screening, but over-estimates results for HbA1c and LDL screening.
Our model will improve decision-makers' abilities to assess the feasibility of
pilot success, with reproducible, literature-based systems models. Our model
identifies intervention and healthcare system components to which outcomes are
sensitive, so these aspects can be monitored and controlled during pilot
implementation. More work is needed to improve replication of HbA1c and LDL
screening, and to elaborate sub-models related to intervention components.

available for permeation in real GO membranes due to holes between irregularly

permeation cross section due to holes and cracks in GO flakes, especially
abundant due to prolonged sonication of dispersions. Permeation of solutions
mostly through pinholes penetrating tens of GO layers suggests that ""graphene
capillaries"" are not required to explain water flow across the membrane. Taking
into account realistic packing of GO flakes with holes between the flakes and
across the flakes, 2-3 orders of magnitude shorter permeation path should be
formed. Considering shorter zigzag permeation path between GO sheets and 5-10 %
of area in each layer available for permeation due to holes across and between

diffusion. In absence of ""graphene capillaries"", the ""ultra-precise sieving""

swelling of GO membranes is different for different solutions, depends on

Many 2D and 3D deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art segmentation
performance on 3D biomedical image datasets. Yet, 2D and 3D models have their
own strengths and weaknesses, and by unifying them together, one may be able to
achieve more accurate results. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble
learning framework for 3D biomedical image segmentation that combines the
merits of 2D and 3D models. First, we develop a fully convolutional network
based meta-learner to learn how to improve the results from 2D and 3D models
(base-learners). Then, to minimize over-fitting for our sophisticated
meta-learner, we devise a new training method that uses the results of the
base-learners as multiple versions of ""ground truths"". Furthermore, since our
new meta-learner training scheme does not depend on manual annotation, it can
utilize abundant unlabeled 3D image data to further improve the model.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets (the HVSMR 2016 Challenge dataset
and the mouse piriform cortex dataset) show that our approach is effective
under fully-supervised, semi-supervised, and transductive settings, and attains
superior performance over state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.

primordial density perturbations lack correlations on large distance scales. To
test this idea, we replace Fourier modes by a wavelet basis with compact
spatial support. While the angular correlation function of perturbations can
readily be suppressed, the observed monopole and dipole-subtracted correlation
function is not generally suppressed. This suggests that suppression of

cryomodules that are currently being produced for LCLS-II. We compare the

Using a new separator theorem, we show that unit ball graphs in $\mathbb{H}^d$
enjoy similar properties as their Euclidean counterparts, but in one dimension
lower: many standard graph problems, such as Independent Set, Dominating Set,
Steiner Tree, and Hamiltonian Cycle can be solved in $2^{O(n^{1-1/(d-1)})}$

are optimal up to constant factors in the exponent under ETH.
  This drop in dimension has the largest impact in $\mathbb{H}^2$, where we
introduce a new technique to bound the treewidth of noisy uniform disk graphs.
The bounds yield quasi-polynomial ($n^{O(\log n)}$) algorithms for all of the
studied problems, while in the case of Hamiltonian Cycle and $3$-Coloring we
even get polynomial time algorithms. Furthermore, if the underlying noisy disks

be solved in polynomial time. This contrasts with the fact that these problems
require $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ time under ETH in constant maximum degree
Euclidean unit disk graphs.
  Finally, we complement our quasi-polynomial algorithm for Independent Set in
noisy uniform disk graphs with a matching $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ lower bound
under ETH. This shows that the hyperbolic plane is a potential source of

In addition, spectral indices designed to search for composite atmosphere brown

Most studies investigate how tradeoffs promote deterministic coexistence of
species. It remains unclear how tradeoffs may instead promote historically
contingent exclusion of species, where species dominance is affected by initial
abundances, causing alternative community states. Focusing on the
establishment-longevity tradeoff, we study the transient dynamics and
equilibrium outcomes of competitive interactions in a simulation model of plant
community assembly. We show that, in this model, the establishment-longevity
tradeoff is a necessary but not sufficient condition for alternative stable
equilibria that require also low fecundity for both species. An analytical
approximation of our simulation model demonstrates that alternative stable
equilibria are driven by demographic stochasticity in the number of seeds
arriving at each establishment site. This site-scale stochasticity is only
affected by fecundity and therefore occurs even in infinitely large
communities. In many cases where the establishment-longevity tradeoff does not
cause alternative stable equilibria, it still decreases the rate of convergence
toward the single equilibrium, resulting in decades of transient dynamics that
can appear indistinguishable from alternative stable equilibria in empirical
studies.

spin labeled (ASL) perfusion imaging and to develop methods that measure
uncertainty and that adapt the CNN model to a specific false positive vs. false
negative tradeoff.
  METHODS: The Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) U-Net was trained on data from 22
subjects and tested on data from 6 heart transplant recipients. Manual
segmentation and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) were available for
comparison. We consider two global uncertainty measures, named Dice Uncertainty
and MCD Uncertainty, which were calculated with and without the use of manual
segmentation, respectively. Tversky loss function with a hyperparameter $\beta$
was used to adapt the model to a specific false positive vs. false negative
tradeoff.
  RESULTS: The MCD U-Net achieved Dice coefficient of mean(std) = 0.91(0.04) on
the test set. MBF measured using automatic segmentations was highly correlated
to that measured using the manual segmentation ($R^2$ = 0.96). Dice Uncertainty
and MCD Uncertainty were in good agreement ($R^2$ = 0.64). As $\beta$
increased, the false positive rate systematically decreased and false negative
rate systematically increased.
  CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the feasibility of deep CNN for automatic
segmentation of myocardial ASL, with good accuracy. We also introduce two
simple methods for assessing model uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the
ability to adapt the CNN model to a specific false positive vs. false negative
tradeoff. These findings are directly relevant to automatic segmentation in
quantitative cardiac MRI and are broadly applicable to automatic segmentation
problems in diagnostic imaging.

Due to the large volumes of data being processed, several research efforts,
across multiple communities, have explored how to scale up recursive queries,
typically expressed in Datalog. Our experience with these tools indicated that
their performance does not translate across domains (e.g., a tool design for
large-scale graph analytics does not exhibit the same performance on
program-analysis tasks, and vice versa). As a result, we designed and
implemented a general-purpose Datalog engine, called RecStep, on top of a
parallel single-node relational system. In this paper, we outline the different
techniques we use in RecStep, and the contribution of each technique to overall
performance. We also present results from a detailed set of experiments
comparing RecStep with a number of other Datalog systems using both graph
analytics and program-analysis tasks, summarizing pros and cons of existing
techniques based on the analysis of our observations. We show that RecStep
generally outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel Datalog engines on complex

insight from our work is that we show that it is possible to build a
high-performance Datalog system on top of a relational engine, an idea that has

gravity in AdS, exactly stability of extremal black branes is in tension with
rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy.
Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which
reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and
it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion,
assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and
holography. The pathology is related to the development of an infinite throat
in the near-horizon region of the extremal solutions, which suggests a
connection to the ER=EPR proposal.

strong coupling and plays an important role as perhaps the simplest holographic
model of quantum gravity and black holes. The present work considers a deformed
SYK model and a sudden quantum quench in the deformation parameter. The system,
as in the undeformed case, permits a low energy description in terms of pseudo
Nambu Goldstone modes. The bulk dual of such a system represents a
gravitational collapse, which is characterized by a bulk matter stress tensor
whose value near the boundary shows a sudden jump at the time of the quench.
The resulting gravitational collapse forms a black hole only if the deformation
parameter $\Delta\epsilon$ exceeds a certain critical value $\Delta\epsilon_c$
and forms a horizonless geometry otherwise. In case a black hole does form, the
resulting Hawking temperature is given by a fractional power $T_{bh} \propto
(\Delta\epsilon - \Delta\epsilon_c)^{1/2}$, which is reminiscent of the
`Choptuik phenomenon' of critical gravitational collapse.

situations, the more they need to be flexible, adaptive, and creative in
achieving the goal we have given them. Thus, a certain level of freedom to
choose the best path to the goal is inherent in making AI robust and flexible
enough. At the same time, however, the pervasive deployment of AI in our life,
whether AI is autonomous or collaborating with humans, raises several ethical
challenges. AI agents should be aware and follow appropriate ethical principles
and should thus exhibit properties such as fairness or other virtues. These
ethical principles should define the boundaries of AI's freedom and creativity.
However, it is still a challenge to understand how to specify and reason with
ethical boundaries in AI agents and how to combine them appropriately with
subjective preferences and goal specifications. Some initial attempts employ
either a data-driven example-based approach for both, or a symbolic rule-based
approach for both. We envision a modular approach where any AI technique can be
used for any of these essential ingredients in decision making or decision
support systems, paired with a contextual approach to define their combination
and relative weight. In a world where neither humans nor AI systems work in
isolation, but are tightly interconnected, e.g., the Internet of Things, we
also envision a compositional approach to building ethically bounded AI, where
the ethical properties of each component can be fruitfully exploited to derive
those of the overall system. In this paper we define and motivate the notion of
ethically-bounded AI, we describe two concrete examples, and we outline some
outstanding challenges.

correlations between galaxy morphology, size and more importantly, photometric
redshifts. This realism is essential so that selection and shape measurement
biases can be calibrated accurately for a tomographic cosmic shear analysis. We
emulate Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) observations of the COSMOS field using
morphological information from {\it Hubble} Space Telescope imaging, faithfully
reproducing the measured galaxy properties from KiDS observations of the same
field. We calibrate our shear measurements from lensfit, and find through a
range of sensitivity tests that lensfit is robust and unbiased within the
allowed 2 per cent tolerance of our study. Our results show that the
calibration has to be performed by selecting the tomographic samples in the
simulations, consistent with the actual cosmic shear analysis, because the
joint distributions of galaxy properties are found to vary with redshift.
Ignoring this redshift variation could result in misestimating the shear bias
by an amount that exceeds the allowed tolerance. To improve the calibration for
future cosmic shear analyses, it will be essential to also correctly account
for the measurement of photometric redshifts, which requires simulating
multi-band observations.

transport equation is derived. The resulting distribution function treats the
rotation or gyration of spherical particles as an independent classical
variable, deviating from the quantum mechanical treatment of molecular rotation
found in the Wang Chang-Uhlenbeck equation. The Boltzmann-Curtiss equation,
therefore, does not treat different rotational motions as separate molecular
species. The first-order distribution function yields momentum equations for
the translational velocity and gyration that match the form of the governing
equations of morphing continuum theory (MCT), a theory derived from the
approach of rational continuum thermomechanics. The contribution of the local
rotation to the Cauchy stress and the viscous diffusion are found to be
proportional to an identical expression based off the relaxation time, number
density, and equilibrium temperature of the fluid. When gyration is equated to
the macroscopic angular velocity, the kinetic description reduces to the
first-order approximation for a classical monatomic gas, and the governing
equations match the form of the Navier--Stokes equations. The relaxation time
used for this approximation is shown to be more complex due to the additional
variable of local rotation. The approach of De Groot and Mazur is invoked to
give an initial approximation for the relaxation of the gyration. The
incorporation of this relaxation time, and other physical parameters, into the
coefficients of the governing equations provides a more in-depth physical
treatment of the new terms in the MCT equations, allowing experimenters to test
these expressions and get a better understanding of new coefficients in MCT.

include thermal `heating,' direct wind or momentum injection, cosmic ray

Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model, including simplified toy
energy-injection models, where we arbitrarily vary the strength, injection
scale, and physical form of the energy. We explore which scenarios can quench
without violating observational constraints on energetics or ICM gas. We show
that turbulent stirring in the central $\sim100\,$kpc, or cosmic-ray injection,
can both maintain a stable low-SFR halo for $>$Gyr timescales with modest
energy input, by providing a non-thermal pressure which stably lowers the core
density and cooling rates. In both cases, associated thermal-heating processes
are negligible. Turbulent stirring preserves cool-core features while mixing
condensed core gas into the hotter halo and is by far the most energy efficient
model. Pure thermal heating or nuclear isotropic momentum injection require
vastly larger energy, are less efficient in lower-mass halos, easily over-heat
cores, and require fine-tuning to avoid driving unphysical temperature
gradients or gas expulsion from the halo center.

the type IIB part of the string theory landscape. Its mass is suppressed by the
third power of the warp factor of a strongly warped region (Klebanov-Strassler
throat), suggesting the name thraxion. Our observation is based on the generic
presence of several throats sharing the same 2-cycle. This cycle shrinks to
zero volume at the end of each throat. It is hence trivial in homology and the
corresponding $C_2$ axion is massive. However, the mass is warping-suppressed
since, if one were to cut off the strongly warped regions, a proper 2-cycle
would re-emerge. Since the kinetic term of the axion is dominated in the UV, an
even stronger, quadratic mass suppression results. Moreover, if the axion is
excited, the angular modes of the throats backreact. This gives our effective
$C_2$ axion a finite monodromy and flattens its potential even further.
Eventually, the mass turns out to scale as the third power of the warp factor.
We briefly discuss possible implications for phenomenology and potential
violations of the Weak Gravity Conjecture for axions. Moreover we identify a
mechanism for generating super-Planckian axionic field ranges which we call
drifting monodromies. However, in the examples we consider, the potential
oscillates on sub-Planckian distances in field space, preventing us from
building a natural inflation model on the basis of this idea.

$H_0$, is the only free cosmological parameter left in the gravitational
lensing formalism. We investigate to which accuracy and precision the lensing
distance ratio $D$ is determined from the Pantheon sample. Inserting $D$ and
its uncertainty into the lensing equations for given $H_0$, esp. the time-delay
equation between a pair of multiple images, allows to determine lens
properties, esp. differences in the lensing potential ($\Delta \phi$), without
specifying a cosmological model. We expand the luminosity distances into an

show that the only stable method is to use two first derivatives with
alternating differenced and symmetric SPH derivative operators, with the
caveat, that one may need to apply smoothing or use an artificial conductivity

that with two first derivatives the stable timestep can be 3--8 times larger

saturate the bound, in general. We found that, although the impurity breaks
translational invariance, it is, in some sense, restored in the BPS sector

mutual distance. This is reflected in the existence of a generalised
translational symmetry and a zero mode. We also investigate scattering
processes. In particular, we compare the antikink-impurity interaction close to
the BPS regime, which presents a rather smooth, elastic like nature, with other
scattering processes. However, even in this case, after exciting a sufficiently
large linear mode on the incoming antikink, we can depart from the close-to-BPS
regime. This results, for example, in a backward scattering.

galaxy clusters ($M_{\rm halo} > 10^{15}$M$_{\odot}$) show that their median
radial mass density profile remains unchanged up to $z > 1$, displaying a
highly self-similar evolution. We verify this by using the data set of the THE
THREE HUNDRED project, i.e. 324 cluster-sized haloes as found in full physics
hydrodynamical simulations. We track the progenitors of the mass-complete
sample of clusters at $z=0$, and find that their median shape is already in
place by $z=2.5$. However, selecting a dynamically relaxed subsample ($\sim16$
per cent of the clusters), we observe a shift of the scale radius $r_s$ towards
larger values at earlier times. Classifying the whole sample by formation time,
this evolution is understood as a result of a two-phase halo mass accretion
process. Early-forming clusters -- identified as relaxed today -- have already
entered their slow accretion phase, hence their mass growth occurs mostly at
the outskirts. Late-forming clusters -- which are still unrelaxed today -- are
in their fast accretion phase, thus the central region of the clusters is still
growing. We conclude that the density profile of galaxy clusters shows a
profound self-similarity out to redshifts $z\sim2.5$. This result holds for
both gas and total density profiles when including baryonic physics, as
reported here for two rather distinct sub-grid models.

at design sensitivity. The two main formation channels of these binaries are
gravitational capture and the secular Kozai-Lidov mechanism, with expectedly
commensurable formation rates. We used Monte Carlo simulations to construct the
eccentricity distributions of EBBHs formed through these channels in galactic

reconstruct maximum a posteriori (MAP) convergence maps by formulating an
unconstrained Bayesian inference problem with Laplace-type l1-norm

mass-mapping in this manner allows us to exploit recent developments in
probability concentration theory to infer theoretically conservative
uncertainties for our MAP reconstructions, without relying on assumptions of
Gaussianity. For the first time these methods allow us to perform hypothesis
testing of structure, from which it is possible to distinguish between physical

formalism, demonstrate the method on simulations, before applying the developed
formalism to two observational datasets of the Abel-520 cluster. Initial
reconstructions of the Abel-520 catalogs reported the detection of an anomalous
'dark core' -- an over dense region with no optical counterpart -- which was
taken to be evidence for self-interacting dark-matter. In our Bayesian
framework it is found that neither Abel-520 dataset can conclusively determine
the physicality of such dark cores at 99% confidence. However, in both cases
the recovered MAP estimators are consistent with both sets of data.

the X-ray image with a 4.9 GHz VLA radio map available in the literature. The
dominant contribution comes from the radio core but significant X-ray emission
is detected at larger angular separations from it, surrounding both radio jets

to a plasma collisionally heated by jet-driven shocks and not magnetically

could be responsible for the radio depolarization observed in 3C 459, as
recently proposed also for 3C 171 and 3C 305. On the other hand, our spectral

non-Gaussian (PNG) initial conditions of the local type. In this scenario, the
dark matter halo bias exhibits a characteristic scale dependence on large
scales, which has been recognized as one of the most promising probes of the
local PNG. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with Gaussian and non-Gaussian
initial conditions, we find that the void bias features scale-dependent
corrections on large scales, similar to its halo counterpart. We find excellent
agreement between the numerical measurement of the PNG void bias and the
general peak-background split prediction. Contrary to halos, large voids
anti-correlate with the dark matter density field, and the large-scale Gaussian
void bias ranges from positive to negative values depending on void size and
redshift. Thus, the information in the clustering of voids can be complementary
to that of the halos. Using the Fisher matrix formalism for multiple tracers,
we demonstrate that including the scale-dependent bias information from voids,
constraints on the PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ can be tightened by a factor of
two compared to the accessible information from halos alone, when the sampling
density of tracers reaches $4 \times 10^{-3} \, h^3 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3} $.

events on these galaxies using state-of-the-art measurements of the AGN
occupation of galaxies. The explicit assumption is that the large-scale
distribution of AGN is independent of the physics of black-hole fueling. The
model is shown to be consistent with current measurements of the two-point
correlation function of AGN samples. It is then used to make inferences on the
halo occupation of the AGN population. Mock AGN are found in halos with a broad
distribution of masses with a mode of $\approx 10^{12}\,h^{-1} \, M_{\odot}$
and a tail extending to cluster-size halos. The clustering properties of the
model AGN depend only weakly on accretion luminosity and redshift. The fraction
of satellite AGN in the model increases steeply toward more massive halos, in

of shower maximum in the energy range between $10^{15}$~eV and $10^{18}$~eV. We
consider a Galactic component that is a mixture of five representative nuclear
species (H, He, N, Si and Fe), for which we adopt rigidity dependent broken
power-law spectra, and we allow for an extragalactic component which becomes
strongly suppressed for decreasing energies. The relative abundances of the
Galactic components at $10^{15}$~eV are taken to be comparable to those
determined by direct measurements at $10^{13}$~eV. The main features of the
spectrum and of the composition are reproduced in these scenarios. The spectral
knee results from the break of the H spectrum at $E_{\rm k}\simeq 3\times
10^{15}$~eV, although it is broaden by the comparable contribution from He
which has a break at about $6\times 10^{15}$~eV. The low-energy ankle at
$E_{\rm la}\simeq 2\times 10^{16}$~eV is associated to the strong suppression
of the H and He Galactic components and the increasing relative contribution of
the heavier ones, but the observed hardening of the spectrum at this energy
turns out to result from the growing contribution of the extragalactic
component. The second-knee at $E_{\rm sk}\simeq 26 E_{\rm k}\simeq 8\times
10^{16}$~eV is associated with the steepening of the Galactic Fe component. The
transition to the regime in which the total cosmic ray flux is dominated by the
extragalactic component takes place at an energy of about $10^{17}$~eV. The
parameters of the fit depend on the hadronic model that is used to interpret
the $X_{\rm max}$ measurements as well as on the specific $X_{\rm max}$ dataset
that is considered in the fit. The impact of the possible existence of a
maximum rigidity cutoff in the Galactic components is also discussed.

the von Neumann entropy of a generic quantum state directly in terms of the
Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of outcomes in a defined

visible above the Drude absorption background even in chemical vapor deposited

the grating in close proximity to graphene, the plasmon field becomes tightly
bound below the metal stripes, while the resonant frequency is determined by
the stripe width but not by grating period. Our results open the prospects of
large-area commercially available graphene for resonant terahertz detectors.

proved that the condition of having the order topology associated to the

programme that is part of the UTMOST project at the refurbished Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Radio Telescope (MOST) near Canberra, Australia. We
currently observe more than 400 mainly bright southern radio pulsars with up to
daily cadences. For 205 (8 in binaries, 4 millisecond pulsars) we publish
updated timing models, together with their flux densities, flux density
variability, and pulse widths at 843 MHz, derived from observations spanning
between 1.4 and 3 yr. In comparison with the ATNF pulsar catalogue, we improve
the precision of the rotational and astrometric parameters for 123 pulsars, for
47 by at least an order of magnitude. The time spans between our measurements
and those in the literature are up to 48 yr, which allows us to investigate
their long-term spin-down history and to estimate proper motions for 60
pulsars, of which 24 are newly determined and most are major improvements. The
results are consistent with interferometric measurements from the literature. A
model with two Gaussian components centred at 139 and $463~\text{km} \:
\text{s}^{-1}$ fits the transverse velocity distribution best. The pulse duty
cycle distributions at 50 and 10 per cent maximum are best described by
log-normal distributions with medians of 2.3 and 4.4 per cent, respectively. We
discuss two pulsars that exhibit spin-down rate changes and drifting subpulses.
Finally, we describe the autonomous observing system and the dynamic scheduler
that has increased the observing efficiency by a factor of 2-3 in comparison
with static scheduling.

(DSHARP), one of the initial Large Programs conducted with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary goal of DSHARP is to find
and characterize substructures in the spatial distributions of solid particles
for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary disks, using very high resolution
(0.035 arcsec, or 5 au FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum
emission. These data provide a first homogeneous look at the small-scale
features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process,
quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry,
and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties.
We find that these substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright
disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings
and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped
azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are
found at a wide range of disk radii (from a few au to more than 100 au), are
usually compact ($<$10 au), and show a wide range of amplitudes (brightness
contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe the survey
design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration,
highlight some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key
conclusions that are presented in more detail in a series of accompanying
articles. The DSHARP data -- including visibilities, images, calibration
scripts, and more -- are released for community use at

single-disk systems targeted in this survey. No dominant architecture emerges
from this sample; instead, remarkably diverse morphologies are observed.
Annular substructures can occur at virtually any radius where millimeter
continuum emission is detected and range in widths from a few au to tens of au.
Intensity ratios between gaps and adjacent rings range from near-unity to just
a few percent. In a minority of cases, annular substructures co-exist with
other types of substructures, including spiral arms (3/18) and crescent-like
azimuthal asymmetries (2/18). No clear trend is observed between the positions
of the substructures and stellar host properties. In particular, the absence of
an obvious association with stellar host luminosity (and hence the disk thermal
structure) suggests that substructures do not occur preferentially near major
molecular snowlines. Annular substructures like those observed in DSHARP have
long been hypothesized to be due to planet-disk interactions. A few disks
exhibit characteristics particularly suggestive of this scenario, including
substructures in possible mean-motion resonance and ""double gap"" features
reminiscent of hydrodynamical simulations of multiple gaps opened by a planet
in a low-viscosity disk.

largest homogeneous high-resolution ($\sim 0.035$ arcsec, or $\sim$ 5 au) disk
continuum imaging survey with ALMA so far. In the coming years, many more disks
will be mapped with ALMA at similar resolution. Interpreting the results in
terms of the properties and quantities of the emitting dusty material is,
however, a very non-trivial task. This is in part due to the uncertainty in the
dust opacities, an uncertainty which is not likely to be resolved any time
soon. It is also partly due to the fact that, as the DSHARP survey has shown,
these disk often contain regions of intermediate to high optical depth, even at
millimeter wavelengths and at relatively large radius in the disk. This makes
the interpretation challenging, in particular if the grains are large and have
a large albedo. On the other hand, the highly structured features seen in the
DSHARP survey, of which strong indications were already seen in earlier
observations, provide a unique opportunity to study the dust growth and
dynamics. To provide continuity within the DSHARP project, its follow-up
projects, and projects by other teams interested in these data, we present here
the methods and opacity choices used within the DSHARP collaboration to link
the measured intensity $I_\nu$ to dust surface density $\Sigma_d$.

multiple well-defined and nearly perfectly circular rings in the continuum, in
many cases with substantial peak-to-valley contrast. The DSHARP campaign shows
that several of these rings are very narrow in radial extent. In this paper we
test the hypothesis that these dust rings are caused by dust trapping in radial
pressure bumps, and if confirmed, put constraints on the physics of the dust
trapping mechanism. We model this process analytically in 1D, assuming
axisymmetry. By comparing this model to the data, we find that all rings are
consistent with dust trapping. Based on a plausible model of the dust
temperature we find that several rings are narrower than the pressure scale
height, providing strong evidence for dust trapping. The rings have peak
absorption optical depth in the range between 0.2 and 0.5. The dust masses
stored in each of these rings is of the order of tens of Earth masses, though
much ambiguity remains due to the uncertainty of the dust opacities. The dust
rings are dense enough to potentially trigger the streaming instability, but
our analysis cannot give proof of this mechanism actually operating. Our
results show, however, that the combination of very low alpha_turb << 5e-4 and
very large grains a_grain >> 0.1 cm can be excluded by the data for all the
rings studied in this paper.

2-D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust components. We
present the resulting gas structures, including the relationship between the
planet mass and 1) the gaseous gap depth/width, and 2) the sub/super-Keplerian
motion across the gap. We then compute dust continuum intensity maps at the

planet mass and 1) the depth/width of the gaps at millimeter intensity maps, 2)
the gap edge ellipticity and asymmetry, and 3) the position of secondary gaps
induced by the planet. With these relationships, we lay out the procedure to
constrain the planet mass using gap properties, and study the potential planets
in the DSHARP disks. We highlight the excellent agreement between observations
and simulations for AS 209 and the detectability of the young Solar System
analog. Finally, under the assumption that the detected gaps are induced by
young planets, we characterize the young planet population in the planet
mass-semimajor axis diagram. We find that the occurrence rate for $>$ 5 $M_J$

substructures allow us probe a wide-orbit planet population (Neptune to Jupiter

of the most unusual disks from the DSHARP sample, the first high angular
resolution ALMA survey of disks (Andrews et al. 2018), as nearly all of the
emission can be explained with concentric Gaussian rings. In particular, the
dust emission consists of a series of narrow and closely spaced rings in the
inner $\sim$60 au, two well-separated bright rings in the outer disk, centered
at 74 and 120 au, and at least two fainter emission features at 90 and 130 au.
We model the visibilities with a parametric representation of the radial
surface brightness profile, consisting of a central core and 7 concentric
Gaussian rings. Recent hydro-dynamical simulations of low viscosity disks show
that super-Earth planets can produce the multiple gaps seen in AS 209
millimeter continuum emission. The $^{12}$CO line emission is centrally peaked
and extends out to $\sim$300 au, much farther than the millimeter dust
emission. We find axisymmetric, localized deficits of CO emission around four
distinct radii, near 45, 75, 120 and 210 au. The outermost gap is located well
beyond the edge of the millimeter dust emission, and therefore cannot be due to
dust opacity and must be caused by a genuine CO surface density reduction, due
either to chemical effects or depletion of the overall gas content.

series of concentric rings and gaps together with a bright arc exterior to the
rings that resembles hydrodynamics simulations of a vortex, and a bridge-like
feature connecting the two innermost rings. Although our $^{12}$CO observations
at similar spatial resolution do not show obvious substructure, they reveal an
inner disk depleted of CO emission. From the continuum emission and the CO
velocity field we find that the innermost ring has a higher inclination than
the outermost rings and the arc. This is evidence for either a small

and outer disk, depending on the specific orientation of the near/far sides of
the inner/outer disk. We compare the observed substructures in the ALMA
observations with recent scattered light data from VLT/SPHERE of this object.
In particular, the location of narrow shadow lanes in the SPHERE image combined
with pressure scale height estimates, favor a large misalignment of about

browser mining to display advertisement and indicate browser mining provides a
preferable user experience to advertising when the hash rate is
user-adjustable. Furthermore, over 60% of participants would select browser
mining over advertisement if they were invested in the ecosystem by obtaining
half of the mined cryptocurrency. Our estimations show that browser mining
currently generates revenue at a rate 46 times less than advertisement, however
we would expect that gap to decrease as we observed a significant drop in

and study their dynamics with particle imaging and tracking velocimetry at
multiple resolutions. The carrier flow is simultaneously measured by particle
image velocimetry of suspended tracers, allowing the characterization of the
interplay between both the dispersed and continuous phases. The turbulence
Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale ranges from $Re_{\lambda}\approx
200$ - $500$, while the particle Stokes number based on the Kolmogorov scale
varies between $St_{\eta} = O(1)$ and $O(10)$. Clustering is confirmed to be
most intense for $St_{\eta} \approx 1$, but it extends over larger scales for
heavier particles. Individual clusters form a hierarchy of self-similar,
fractal-like objects, preferentially aligned with gravity and sizes that can
reach the integral scale of the turbulence. Remarkably, the settling velocity
of $St_{\eta} \approx 1$ particles can be several times larger than the
still-air terminal velocity, and the clusters can fall even faster. This is
caused by downward fluid fluctuations preferentially sweeping the particles,
and we propose that this mechanism is influenced by both large and small scales
of the turbulence. The particle-fluid slip velocities show large variance, and
both the instantaneous particle Reynolds number and drag coefficient can
greatly differ from their nominal values. Finally, for sufficient loadings, the
particles generally augment the small-scale fluid velocity fluctuations, which
however may account for a limited fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy.

aspect of measures in the space of fields was overcome with the introduction of
volume elements in Probability Space, leading to stochastic formulations. More
recently Cartier and DeWitt-Morette focused on the definition of a proper
integration measure and established a rigorous mathematical formulation of
functional integration. Their central observation relates to the distributional
nature of fields, for it leads to the identification of distribution
functionals with Schwartz space test functions as density measures. This is
just the mathematical content of the Taylor-Lagrange Scheme developed by the
authors in a recent past. In this scheme fields are living in metric
Schwartz-Sobolev spaces, subject to open coverings with subordinate
partition-of-unity test functions. In effect these PU, through the convolution
operation, lead to smooth field functions on an extended Schwartz space. In
this way the basic assumption of differential geometry -- that fields live on
differentiable manifolds -- is validated. Next it is shown that convolution in
the theory of distributions leads to a sound definition of Laplace-Stieltjes
transforms , stemming from the existence of an isometry invariant Hausdorff
measure in the space of fields. Turning to gauge theories the construction of
smooth vector fields on a curved manifold is established, as required for
differentiable vector fibre bundles. The proper choice of a connection further
separates in the functional Hausdorff integration measure a finite Gaussian
integration over the gauge parameter which factors out and plays no physical
role. For non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories the properties of
Vilkowisky-DeWitt's connection and of Landau-DeWitt's covariant back-ground

magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of Cr$_2$O$_3$ is studied using
first-principles calculations. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction contributes
substantially to MAE by inducing spin canting when the antiferromagnetic order
parameter is not aligned with the hexagonal axis. Nearly cubic crystal field
results in a very small MAE in pure Cr$_2$O$_3$ at zero strain, which is
incorrectly predicted to be negative (in-plane) on account of spin canting. The
MAE is strongly modified by epitaxial strain, which tunes the crystal-field
splitting of the $t_{2g}$ triplet. The contribution from magnetic dipolar
interaction is very small at any strain. The effects of cation (Al, Ti, V, Co,
Fe, Nb, Zr, Mo) and anion (B) substitutions on MAE are examined. Al increases
MAE thanks to the local lattice deformation. In contrast, the electronic
configuration of V and Nb strongly promotes easy-plane anisotropy, while other
transition-metal dopants have only a moderate effect on MAE. Substitution of
oxygen by boron, which has been reported to increase the N\'eel temperature,
has a weak effect on MAE, whose sign depends on the charge state of B. The
electric field applied along the (0001) axis has a weak second-order effect on
the MAE.

($\Sigma_{g}$) perturbation towards the AS~209 protoplanetary disk from the
optically thin C$^{18}$O ($J=2-1$) emission. The observations were carried out
at 1.3~mm with ALMA at a spatial resolution of about 0.3$\arcsec$ $\times$
0.2$\arcsec$ (corresponding to $\sim$ 38 $\times$ 25 au). The C$^{18}$O
emission shows a compact ($\le$60~au), centrally peaked emission and an outer
ring peaking at 140~au, consistent with that observed in the continuum emission
and, its azimuthally averaged radial intensity profile presents a deficit that
is spatially coincident with the previously reported dust map. This deficit can
only be reproduced with our physico-thermochemical disk model by lowering
$\Sigma_{gas}$ by nearly an order of magnitude in the dust gaps. Another
salient result is that contrary to C$^{18}$O, the DCO$^{+}$ ($J=3-2$) emission
peaks between the two dust gaps. We infer that the best scenario to explain our
observations (C$^{18}$O deficit and DCO$^{+}$ enhancement) is a gas
perturbation due to forming-planet(s), that is commensurate with previous
continuum observations of the source along with hydrodynamical simulations. Our
findings confirm that the previously observed dust gaps are very likely due to
perturbation of the gas surface density that is induced by a planet of at least
0.2~M$\rm_{Jupiter}$ in formation. Finally, our observations also show the
potential of using CO isotopologues to probe the presence of saturn mass

  with state-space models",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Randomized trials and observational studies, more often than not, run over a
certain period of time. The treatment effect evolves during this period which
provides crucial insights into the treatment response and the long-term
effects. Many conventional methods for estimating treatment effects are limited
to the i.i.d. setting and are not suited for inferring the time dynamics of the
treatment effect. The time series encountered in these settings are highly
informative but often nonstationary due to the changing effects of treatment.
This increases the difficulty, since stationarity, a common assumption in time
series analysis, cannot be reasonably assumed. Another challenge is the
heterogeneity of the treatment effect when the treatment affects units
differently. The task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from
nonstationary and, in particular, interventional time series is highly relevant
but has remained unexplored yet. We propose Causal Transfer, a method which
combines regression to adjust for confounding with time series modelling to
learn the effect of the treatment and how it evolves over time. Causal Transfer
does not assume the data to be stationary and can be applied to randomized
trials and observational studies in which treatment is confounded. Causal
Transfer adjusts the effect for possible confounders and transfers the learned
effect to other time series and, thereby, estimates various forms of treatment
effects, such as the average treatment effect (ATE) or the conditional average
treatment effect (CATE). By learning the time dynamics of the effect, Causal
Transfer can also predict the treatment effect for unobserved future time
points and determine the long-term consequences of treatment.

made by algorithms, it is important to ensure that the treatment of individuals
under such algorithms is demonstrably fair under reasonable notions of
fairness. One compelling notion proposed in the literature is that of
individual fairness (IF), which advocates that similar individuals should be
treated similarly (Dwork et al. 2012). Originally proposed for offline
decisions, this notion does not, however, account for temporal considerations
relevant for online decision-making. In this paper, we extend the notion of IF
to account for the time at which a decision is made, in settings where there
exists a notion of conduciveness of decisions as perceived by the affected
individuals. We introduce two definitions: (i) fairness-across-time (FT) and
(ii) fairness-in-hindsight (FH). FT is the simplest temporal extension of IF
where treatment of individuals is required to be individually fair relative to
the past as well as future, while in FH, we require a one-sided notion of
individual fairness that is defined relative to only the past decisions. We
show that these two definitions can have drastically different implications in
the setting where the principal needs to learn the utility model. Linear regret
relative to optimal individually fair decisions is inevitable under FT for
non-trivial examples. On the other hand, we design a new algorithm: Cautious
Fair Exploration (CaFE), which satisfies FH and achieves sub-linear regret
guarantees for a broad range of settings. We characterize lower bounds showing
that these guarantees are order-optimal in the worst case. FH can thus be
embedded as a primary safeguard against unfair discrimination in algorithmic
deployments, without hindering the ability to take good decisions in the
long-run.

(GPUs) lend themselves to accelerate data-intensive analytics, especially when
such applications fit the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) model.
However, graph algorithms such as breadth-first search and k-core, often fail
to take full advantage of GPUs, due to irregularity in memory access and
control flow. To address this challenge, we have developed SIMD-X, for
programming and processing of single instruction multiple, complex, data on
GPUs. Specifically, the new Active-Compute-Combine (ACC) model not only
provides ease of programming to programmers, but more importantly creates
opportunities for system-level optimizations. To this end, SIMD-X utilizes
just-in-time task management which filters out inactive vertices at runtime and
intelligently maps various tasks to different amount of GPU cores in pursuit of
workload balancing. In addition, SIMD-X leverages push-pull based kernel fusion
that, with the help of a new deadlock-free global barrier, reduces a large
number of computation kernels to very few. Using SIMD-X, a user can program a
graph algorithm in tens of lines of code, while achieving 3?, 6?, 24?, 3?
speedup over Gunrock, Galois, CuSha, and Ligra, respectively.

SLSN-I sample significantly broadens the distribution of SLSN-I light curve

magnetar model to our SLSNe, and find that this model alone is unable to
replicate the behaviour of many of the bolometric light curves. We search the
DES SLSN-I light curves for the presence of initial peaks prior to the main
light-curve peak. Using a shock breakout model, our Monte Carlo search finds
that 3 of our 14 events with pre-max data display such initial peaks. However,
10 events show no evidence for such peaks, in some cases down to an absolute

enables the visualization of magnetic tracer materials with a temporal
resolution of more than 46 volumes per second. In MPI the size of the field of
view scales with the strengths of the applied magnetic fields. In clinical
applications those strengths are limited by peripheral nerve stimulation,
specific absorption rates, and the requirement to acquire images of high
spatial resolution. Therefore, the size of the field of view is usually a few
cubic centimeters. To bypass this limitation, additional focus fields and/or
external object movements can be applied. In this work, the latter approach is
investigated. An object is moved through the scanner bore one step at a time,
while the MPI scanner continuously acquires data from its static field of view.
Using a 3D phantom and dynamic 3D in vivo data it is shown that the data from
such a moving table experiment can be jointly reconstructed after reordering
the data with respect to the stepwise object shifts and heart beat phases.

proposed as a unique excitonic platform for advanced optical and electronic
functionalities. However, in spite of intense research efforts, it has been
largely overlooked that, in addition to displaying rich exciton physics, TMDCs
also possess a very high refractive index. This opens a possibility to utilize
these materials for constructing resonant nanoantennas based on subwavelength
geometrical modes. Here we show that nanodisks fabricated from exfoliated
multilayer WS$_2$ support distinct Mie resonances and so-called anapole states
that can be easily tuned in wavelength over the visible and near-infrared
spectral range by varying the nanodisks' size and aspect ratio. We argue that
the TMDC material anisotropy and the presence of excitons substantially enrich
nanophotonics by complementing traditional approaches based on plasmonics and
well-known high-index materials such as silicon. As a proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate a novel regime of light-matter interaction, anapole-exciton
polaritons, which we realize within a single WS$_2$ nanodisk. Our results thus
suggest that nanopatterned TMDCs are promising materials for high-index
nanophotonics applications with enriched functionalities and superior
prospects.

equation for electron-ion systems. The heart of the algorithm is an expansion
in Laguerre polynomials, which has several advantages, including automatic
conservation of both energy and particles without the need for any special
discretization or time-stepping schemes. One drawback is the $O(N^3)$ memory
requirement, where $N$ is the number of polynomials used. This can impose an
inconvenient limit in cases of practical interest, such as when two particle
species have widely separated temperatures. The algorithm we describe here
addresses this problem by periodically re-projecting the solution onto a
judicious choice of new basis functions that are still Laguerre polynomials but
have arguments adapted to the current physical conditions. This results in a
reduction in the number of polynomials needed, at the expense of increased
solution time. Because the equations are solved with little difficulty, this
added time is not of much concern compared to the savings in memory. To
demonstrate the algorithm, we solve several relaxation problems that could not
be computed with the spectral method without re-projection. Another major
advantage of this method is that it can be used for collision operators more
complicated than that of the Landau equation, and we demonstrate this here by
using it to solve the non-degenerate quantum Lenard-Balescu equation for a
hydrogen plasma.

exponentially large and due to effects which are not visible at any finite

described as more nonperturbative than the usual Schwinger process, which
appears at one loop. Unfortunately, such high temperatures appear to be out of
reach of foreseeable technologies, though nonthermal photon distributions with

centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV is presented. The data have been
recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC during low luminosity operations in
2015. The energy density is studied as a function of pseudorapidity in the
ranges $-$6.6 $< \eta$ $< -$5.2 and 3.15 $< |\eta| <$ 5.20. The results are
compared with the predictions of several models. All the models considered
suggest a different shape of the pseudorapidity dependence compared to that
observed in the data. A comparison with LHC proton-proton collision data at
$\sqrt{s} =$ 0.9 and 7 TeV confirms the compatibility of the data with the
hypothesis of limiting fragmentation.

imagery, and the effects of these techniques on object detection algorithm
performance. Specifically, we enhance satellite imagery beyond its native
resolution, and test if we can identify various types of vehicles, planes, and
boats with greater accuracy than native resolution. Using the Very Deep
Super-Resolution (VDSR) framework and a custom Random Forest Super-Resolution
(RFSR) framework we generate enhancement levels of 2x, 4x, and 8x over five
distinct resolutions ranging from 30 cm to 4.8 meters. Using both native and
super-resolved data, we then train several custom detection models using the
SIMRDWN object detection framework. SIMRDWN combines a number of popular object
detection algorithms (e.g. SSD, YOLO) into a unified framework that is designed
to rapidly detect objects in large satellite images. This approach allows us to
quantify the effects of super-resolution techniques on object detection
performance across multiple classes and resolutions. We also quantify the
performance of object detection as a function of native resolution and object
pixel size. For our test set we note that performance degrades from mean
average precision (mAP) = 0.53 at 30 cm resolution, down to mAP = 0.11 at 4.8 m
resolution. Super-resolving native 30 cm imagery to 15 cm yields the greatest
benefit; a 13-36% improvement in mAP. Super-resolution is less beneficial at
coarser resolutions, though still provides a small improvement in performance.

orbits (spin-orbit angle {\phi} > 90{\deg}). Currently, the largest measured
projected angle between the orbital angular momentum axis of a planet and the
rotation axis of its host star has been found for HAT-P-14b to be $\approx$
171{\deg}. One possible mechanism for the formation of such misalignments is
through long-term interactions between the planet and other planetary or
stellar companions. However, with this process, it has been found to be
difficult to achieve retrogradely orbiting planets, especially planets that
almost exactly counter-orbit their host star ({\phi} $\approx$ 180{\deg}) such
as HAT-P-14b. By contrast, orbital misalignment can be produced efficiently by
perturbations of planetary systems that are passed by stars. Here we
demonstrate that not only retrograde fly-bys, but surprisingly, even prograde
fly-bys can induce retrograde orbits. Our simulations show that depending on
the mass ratio of the involved stars, there are significant ranges of planetary
pre-encounter parameters for which counter-orbiting planets are the natural
consequence. We find that the highest probability to produce counter-orbiting
planets ($\approx$ 20%) is achieved with close prograde, coplanar fly-bys of an
equal-mass perturber with a pericentre distance of one-third of the initial
orbital radius of the planet. For fly-bys where the pericentre distance equals
the initial orbital radius of the planet, we still find a probability to
produce retrograde planets of $\approx$ 10% for high-mass perturbers on
inclined (60{\deg} < i < 120{\deg}) orbits. As usually more distant fly-bys are
more common in star clusters, this means that inclined fly-bys probably lead to
more retrograde planets than those with inclinations < 60{\deg}. (...)

a variant of the widely used discounted cumulative gain (DCG) objective
function which differs from DCG in two important aspects: (i) It limits the
evaluation of DCG only on the top N items in the ranked lists, thereby
eliminating the impact of low-ranked items on the learned ranking function; and
(ii) it incorporates weights that allow the model to leverage multiple types of
implicit feedback with differing levels of reliability or trustworthiness.
Because the resulting objective function is non-smooth and hence challenging to
optimize, we consider two smooth approximations of the objective function,
using the traditional sigmoid function and the rectified linear unit (ReLU). We
propose a family of learning-to-rank algorithms (Top-N-Rank) that work with any
smooth objective function. Then, a more efficient variant, Top-N-Rank.ReLU, is
introduced, which effectively exploits the properties of ReLU function to
reduce the computational complexity of Top-N-Rank from quadratic to linear in
the average number of items rated by users. The results of our experiments
using two widely used benchmarks, namely, the MovieLens data set and the Amazon

objective function substantially improves the ranking quality of the top N
recommendations; (ii) using the ReLU for smoothing the objective function
yields significant improvement in both ranking quality as well as runtime as

  Cohort using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Accepted for SPIE: Medical Imaging 2019",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain imaging analysis on clinically acquired computed tomography (CT) is
essential for the diagnosis, risk prediction of progression, and treatment of
the structural phenotypes of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, in real
clinical imaging scenarios, entire body CT images (e.g., neck, abdomen, chest,
pelvis) are typically captured along with whole brain CT scans. For instance,
in a typical sample of clinical TBI imaging cohort, only ~15% of CT scans
actually contain whole brain CT images suitable for volumetric brain analyses;
the remaining are partial brain or non-brain images. Therefore, a manual image
retrieval process is typically required to isolate the whole brain CT scans
from the entire cohort. However, the manual image retrieval is time and
resource consuming and even more difficult for the larger cohorts. To alleviate
the manual efforts, in this paper we propose an automated 3D medical image
retrieval pipeline, called deep montage-based image retrieval (dMIR), which
performs classification on 2D montage images via a deep convolutional neural
network. The novelty of the proposed method for image processing is to
characterize the medical image retrieval task based on the montage images. In a
cohort of 2000 clinically acquired TBI scans, 794 scans were used as training
data, 206 scans were used as validation data, and the remaining 1000 scans were
used as testing data. The proposed achieved accuracy=1.0, recall=1.0,
precision=1.0, f1=1.0 for validation data, while achieved accuracy=0.988,
recall=0.962, precision=0.962, f1=0.962 for testing data. Thus, the proposed
dMIR is able to perform accurate CT whole brain image retrieval from
large-scale clinical cohorts.

high cost of SSDs, entirely replacing HDDs with SSDs is not economically
justified. Additionally, SSDs can endure a limited number of writes before
failing. To mitigate the shortcomings of SSDs while taking advantage of their
high performance, SSD caching is practiced in both academia and industry.
Previously proposed caching architectures have only focused on either
performance or endurance and neglected to address both parameters in suggested
architectures. Moreover, the cost, reliability, and power consumption of such
architectures is not evaluated. This paper proposes a hybrid I/O caching
architecture that while offers higher performance than previous studies, it
also improves power consumption with a similar budget. The proposed
architecture uses DRAM, Read-Optimized SSD, and Write-Optimized SSD in a
three-level cache hierarchy and tries to efficiently redirect read requests to
either DRAM or RO-SSD while sending writes to WO-SSD. To provide high
reliability, dirty pages are written to at least two devices which removes any
single point of failure. The power consumption is also managed by reducing the
number of accesses issued to SSDs. The proposed architecture reconfigures
itself between performance- and endurance-optimized policies based on the
workload characteristics to maintain an effective tradeoff between performance
and endurance. We have implemented the proposed architecture on a server
equipped with industrial SSDs and HDDs. The experimental results show that as
compared to state-of-the-art studies, the proposed architecture improves
performance and power consumption by an average of 8% and 28%, respectively,
and reduces the cost by 5% while increasing the endurance cost by 4.7% and
negligible reliability penalty.

Preliminary results of our companion Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS)
observations, targeting LyC and Ly$\alpha$, show that those galaxies with the
largest O32 are typically found to also be Ly$\alpha$ emitters. High O32
galaxies are also found to have tentative non-zero LyC escape fractions
($f_{esc}(LyC)$) based on $u$ band photometric detections. These results are
consistent with samples of highly ionized galaxies, including confirmed LyC
emitting galaxies from the literature. We also perform a detailed comparison
between the observed emission line ratios and simulated line ratios from
density bounded H$_{\textrm{II}}$ regions modeled using the photoionization
code MAPPINGS V. Estimates of $f_{esc}(LyC)$ for our sample fall in the range
from 0.0-0.23 and suggest possible tension with published correlations between
O32 and $f_{esc}(LyC)$, adding weight to dichotomy of arguments in the

overall particle residence time appears to be significantly longer with
moderate aortic regurgitation, attributed to the dynamics resulting from the

shown to be associated with higher frequencies in the time-frequency spectra of
the velocity signals at various points in the flow, suggesting nonlaminar
mixing past moderate regurgitation. Additionally, a large part of the

simulation of low Mach number flows in solar and stellar convection zones. The
basic RSST equations are hyperbolic, and are suitable for parallel computation
by domain decomposition. The application of RSST is limited to cases where
density perturbations are much smaller than the background density. In
addition, non-conservative variables are required to be evolved using this
method, which is not suitable in cases where discontinuities like shock waves
co-exist in a single numerical domain. In this study, we suggest a new
semi-conservative formulation of the RSST that can be applied to low Mach
number flows with large density variations. We derive the wave speed of the
original and newly suggested methods to clarify that these methods can reduce
the speed of sound without affecting the entropy wave. The equations are
implemented using the finite volume method. Several numerical tests are carried
out to verify the suggested methods. The analysis and numerical results show
that the original RSST is not applicable when mass density variations are
large. In contrast, the newly suggested methods are found to be efficient in
such cases. We also suggest variants of the RSST that conserve momentum in the
machine precision. The newly suggested variants are formulated as
semi-conservative equations, which reduce to the conservative form of the Euler
equations when the speed of sound is not reduced. This property is advantageous
when both high and low Mach number regions are included in the numerical
domain. The newly suggested forms of RSST can be applied to a wider range of

the roughness Reynolds number, $k^+$, is increased, the Hama roughness

tending towards the fully rough asymptote of $\kappa_m^{-1}\log(k^+)+C$, where
$C$ is a constant that depends on the particular roughness geometry and
$\kappa_m\approx0.4$ is the von K\'arm\'an constant. In this fully rough

knowable. This is prompting questions on the nature of scientific knowledge. A
central issue is what defines a 'good' model. When addressing global properties
of the Universe or its initial state this becomes a particularly pressing
issue. How to assess the probability of the Universe as a whole is empirically
ambiguous, since we can examine only part of a single realisation of the system
under investigation: at some point, data will run out. We review the basics of
applying Bayesian statistical explanation to the Universe as a whole. We argue
that a conventional Bayesian approach to model inference generally fails in
such circumstances, and cannot resolve, e.g., the so-called 'measure problem'
in inflationary cosmology. Implicit and non-empirical valuations inevitably
enter model assessment in these cases. This undermines the possibility to
perform Bayesian model comparison. One must therefore either stay silent, or
pursue a more general form of systematic and rational model assessment. We
outline a generalised axiological Bayesian model inference framework, based on
mathematical lattices. This extends inference based on empirical data
(evidence) to additionally consider the properties of model structure
(elegance) and model possibility space (beneficence). We propose this as a
natural and theoretically well-motivated framework for introducing an explicit,
rational approach to theoretical model prejudice and inference beyond data.

As a function of orbit radius, we find a divergence in the number of cycles
required to reach a collision-free steady state at a critical radius, while
above this radius the system remains in a fluctuating liquid state. For high
densities, the system can organize into a fully phase separated state that is
mostly reversible, but collisions at the boundaries between the phases lead to
a net transport of disks along the boundary edges in a direction determined by
the chirality of the active disk orbits. We map the dynamic phases as a
function of density and orbit radii, and discuss the results in terms of the
reversible-irreversible transition found in other periodically driven
non-thermal systems. We also consider mixtures of circularly driven disks and
ac driven disks where the ac drive is either in or out of phase with the

structure in local velocity space. In terms of in-plane motions, this rich
structure is also seen as multiple ridges in the actions of the axisymmetric
background potential of the Galaxy. These ridges are probably related to a
combination of effects from ongoing phase-mixing and resonances from the spiral
arms and the bar. We have recently developed a method to capture the behaviour
of the stellar phase-space distribution function at a resonance, by
re-expressing it in terms of a new set of canonical actions and angles
variables valid in the resonant region. Here, by properly treating the
distribution function at resonances, and by using a realistic model for a
slowly rotating large Galactic bar with pattern speed 39 km/s/kpc, we show that
no less than six ridges in local action space can be related to resonances with
the bar. Two of these at low angular momentum correspond to the corotation
resonance, and can be associated to the Hercules moving group in local velocity
space. Another one at high angular momentum corresponds to the outer Lindblad
resonance, and can tentatively be associated to the velocity structure seen as
an arch at high azimuthal velocities in Gaia data. The other ridges are
associated to the 3:1, 4:1 and 6:1 resonances. The latter can be associated to
the so-called 'horn' of the local velocity distribution. While it is clear that
effects from spiral arms and incomplete phase-mixing related to external
perturbations also play a role in shaping the complex kinematics revealed by
Gaia data, the present work demonstrates that, contrary to common
misconceptions, the bar alone can create multiple prominent ridges in velocity
and action space.

exploration and exploitation in depth. However, there are numerous applications
where the cardinal absolute-valued feedback model (e.g. ratings from one to
five) is not suitable. This has motivated the formulation of the duelling
bandits problem, where the learner picks a pair of actions and observes a noisy
binary feedback, indicating a relative preference between the two. There exist
a multitude of different settings and interpretations of the problem for two
reasons. First, due to the absence of a total order of actions, there is no
natural definition of the best action. Existing work either explicitly assumes
the existence of a linear order, or uses a custom definition for the winner.
Second, there are multiple reasonable notions of regret to measure the
learner's performance. Most prior work has been focussing on the
$\textit{strong regret}$, which averages the quality of the two actions picked.
This work focusses on the $\textit{weak regret}$, which is based on the quality
of the better of the two actions selected. Weak regret is the more appropriate
performance measure when the pair's inferior action has no significant
detrimental effect on the pair's quality.
  We study the duelling bandits problem in the adversarial setting. We provide
an algorithm which has theoretical guarantees in both the utility-based
setting, which implies a total order, and the unrestricted setting. For the
latter, we work with the $\textit{Borda winner}$, finding the action maximising
the probability of winning against an action sampled uniformly at random. The
thesis concludes with experimental results based on both real-world data and
synthetic data, showing the algorithm's performance and limitations.

predict how model quality degrades as a function of the number of sequences
$N$, sequence length $L$, amino-acid alphabet size $q$, and the degree of
conservation of the MSA, in different applications of the Potts models: In
""fitness"" predictions of individual protein sequences, in predictions of the
effects of single-point mutations, in ""double mutant cycle"" predictions of
epistasis, and in 3-d contact prediction in protein structure. We show how as
MSA depth $N$ decreases an ""overfitting"" effect occurs such that sequences in
the training MSA have overestimated fitness, and we predict the magnitude of
this effect and discuss how regularization can help correct for it, use a
regularization procedure motivated by statistical analysis of the effects of
finite sampling. We find that as $N$ decreases the quality of point-mutation
effect predictions degrade least, fitness and epistasis predictions degrade

quantum circuit to produce a parameter dependent state. For a given
combinatorial optimization problem instance, the quantum expectation of the
associated cost function is the parameter dependent objective function of the
QAOA. We demonstrate that if the parameters are fixed and the instance comes
from a reasonable distribution then the objective function value is
concentrated in the sense that typical instances have (nearly) the same value
of the objective function. This applies not just for optimal parameters as the
whole landscape is instance independent. We can prove this is true for low
depth quantum circuits for instances of MaxCut on large 3-regular graphs. Our
results generalize beyond this example. We support the arguments with numerical
examples that show remarkable concentration. For higher depth circuits the
numerics also show concentration and we argue for this using the Law of Large
Numbers. We also observe by simulation that if we find parameters which result
in good performance at say 10 bits these same parameters result in good
performance at say 24 bits. These findings suggest ways to run the QAOA that
reduce or eliminate the use of the outer loop optimization and may allow us to
find good solutions with fewer calls to the quantum computer.

Faster R-CNN have not been used nearly as much for video analysis. This is
arguably due to the fact that detection models are designed to operate on
single frames and as a result do not have a mechanism for learning motion
representations directly from video. We propose a learning procedure that
allows detection models such as Faster R-CNN to learn motion features directly
from the RGB video data while being optimized with respect to a pose estimation
task. Given a pair of video frames---Frame A and Frame B---we force our model
to predict human pose in Frame A using the features from Frame B. We do so by
leveraging deformable convolutions across space and time. Our network learns to
spatially sample features from Frame B in order to maximize pose detection
accuracy in Frame A. This naturally encourages our network to learn motion
offsets encoding the spatial correspondences between the two frames. We refer
to these motion offsets as DiMoFs (Discriminative Motion Features).
  In our experiments we show that our training scheme helps learn effective
motion cues, which can be used to estimate and localize salient human motion.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that as a byproduct, our model also learns features
that lead to improved pose detection in still-images, and better keypoint
tracking. Finally, we show how to leverage our learned model for the tasks of
spatiotemporal action localization and fine-grained action recognition.

Fano manifolds, if one fiber is biholomorphic to a rational homogeneous space
S, whether is f an S-fibration? The cases of Picard number one were studied in
a series of papers by J.-M. Hwang and N. Mok. For higher Picard number cases,
we notice that the Picard number of a rational homogeneous space G/P is less or
equal to the rank of G. Recently A. Weber and J. A. Wisniewski proved that
rational homogeneous spaces G/P with Picard numbers equal to the rank of G
(i.e. complete flag manifolds) are rigid under Fano deformation. In this paper
we show that the rational homogeneous space G/P is rigid under Fano
deformation, providing that G is a simple algebraic group of type ADE, the
Picard number equal to rank(G)-1 and G/P is not biholomorphic to F(1, 2, P^3)
or F(1, 2, Q^6). The variety F(1, 2, P^3) is the set of flags of projective
lines and planes in P^3, and F(1, 2, Q^6) is the set of flags of projective
lines and planes in 6-dimensional smooth quadric hypersurface. We show that
F(1, 2, P^3) have a unique Fano degeneration, which is explicitly constructed.
The structure of possible Fano degeneration of F(1, 2, Q^6) is also described
explicitly. To prove our rigidity result, we firstly show that the Fano
deformation rigidity of a homogeneous space of type ADE can be implied by that
property of suitable homogeneous submanifolds. Then we complete the proof via
the study of Fano deformation rigidity of rational homogeneous spaces of small
Picard numbers. As a byproduct, we also show the Fano deformation rigidity of
other manifolds such as F(0, 1, ..., k_1, k_2, k_2+1, ..., n-1, P^n) and F(0,

priors given by sparsity, deep models can provide direct low-dimensional
parameterizations of the manifold of images or signals belonging to a
particular natural class, allowing for recovery algorithms to be posed in a
low-dimensional space. This dimensionality may even be lower than the sparsity
level of the same signals when viewed in a fixed basis. What is not known about
these methods is whether there are computationally efficient algorithms whose
sample complexity is optimal in the dimensionality of the representation given

analysis. Under the assumption that the generative model is a neural network
that is sufficiently expansive at each layer and has Gaussian weights, we
provide a gradient descent scheme and prove that for noisy compressive
measurements of a signal in the range of the model, the algorithm converges to
that signal, up to the noise level. The scaling of the sample complexity with
respect to the input dimensionality of the generative prior is linear, and thus
can not be improved except for constants and factors of other variables. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first recovery guarantee for
compressive sensing under generative priors by a computationally efficient

is studied. In particular, a fair time sharing model based on \emph{ruin

Fairness among both WiFi and LTE-U is maintained by applying the concept of the

hypothesized that the bar can either stabilize the gas against collapse,
inhibiting star formation or efficiently consume all the available gas, with no
fuel for further star formation. We present a multi-wavelength study using the
archival data of an early-type barred spiral galaxy, Messier 95, which shows
signatures of suppressed star formation in the bar-region. Using the optical,
ultraviolet, infrared, CO and HI imaging data we study the pattern of star
formation progression, stellar/gas distribution and try to provide insights on
the process responsible for the observed pattern. The FUV$-$NUV pixel colour
map reveals a cavity devoid of UV flux in the bar-region that interestingly
matches with the length of the bar ($\sim$ 4.2kpc). The central nuclear region
of the galaxy is showing a blue color clump and along the major-axis of the
stellar bar the colour progressively becomes redder. Based on a comparison to
single stellar population models, we show that the region of galaxy along the

stellar populations with ages $\geq$ 350 Myr, with a star-forming clump in the

material feature representation and material based tracking. In terms of
benchmark, we construct a dataset of fully-annotated videos, which contain both
hyperspectral and color sequences of the same scene. Material information is
represented by spectral-spatial histogram of multidimensional gradient, which
describes the 3D local spectral-spatial structure in an HSI, and fractional
abundances of constituted material components which encode the underlying

indispensable tool for multivariate analysis. Despite its popularity across
many fields, there are outstanding methodological challenges that have hampered
practical deployments. One major challenge is the selection of the number of
factors, which is exacerbated for dynamic factor models, where factors can
disappear, emerge, and/or reoccur over time. Existing tools that assume a fixed
number of factors may provide a misguided representation of the data mechanism,
especially when the number of factors is crudely misspecified. Another
challenge is the interpretability of the factor structure, which is often
regarded as an unattainable objective due to the lack of identifiability.
Motivated by a topical macroeconomic application, we develop a flexible
Bayesian method for dynamic factor analysis (DFA) that can simultaneously
accommodate a time-varying number of factors and enhance interpretability
without strict identifiability constraints. To this end, we turn to dynamic
sparsity by employing Dynamic Spike-and-Slab (DSS) priors within DFA. Scalable
Bayesian EM estimation is proposed for fast posterior mode identification via
rotations to sparsity, enabling Bayesian data analysis at scales that would
have been previously time-consuming. We study a large-scale balanced panel of

Gas kinematics established by $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ observations indicate that the
continuum spiral arms are trailing. The arm-interarm intensity contrasts are
modest, typically less than 3. The Elias 27 spiral pattern extends throughout
much of the disk, and the arms intersect the gap at $R\sim69$ au. The spiral
pattern in the IM Lup disk is particularly complex-it extends about halfway
radially through the disk, exhibiting pitch angle variations with radius and
interarm features that may be part of ring substructures or spiral arm
branches. Spiral arms also extend most of the way through the WaOph 6 disk, but
the source overall is much more compact than the other two disks. We discuss
possible origins for the spiral structures, including gravitational instability
and density waves induced by a stellar or planetary companion. Unlike the

that it can be easily misled by the presence of irrelevant objects or

needed to enable the methods to ignore irrelevant contexts and extract only
human features. However, we consider this solution is inefficient, since the
bounding boxes might not be available. Hence, instead of using a person
bounding box as an input, we introduce a human-mask loss to automatically guide
the activations of the feature maps to the target human who is performing the
action, and hence suppress the activations of misleading contexts. We propose a
multi-task deep learning method that jointly predicts the human action class

introduces a causal network that captures the causal connections among the

from the unique perspective of the Chang'E-3's (CE-3) ""Yutu"" rover, building on
our previous work (Wang et al. 2017; Wu and Hapke 2018). Measurement of the
visually undisturbed uppermost regolith as well as locations that have been
affected by rocket exhaust from the spacecraft by the Visible-Near Infrared
Spectrometer (VNIS) revealed that the returned samples bring a biased
information about the pristine lunar regolith. The uppermost surficial regolith
is much more weathered than the regolith immediately below, and the finest
fraction is rich in space weathered products. These materials are very dark and
attenuated throughout the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths, hence
reduce the reflectance and mask the absorption features. The effects on the
spectral slope caused by space weathering are wavelength-dependent: the visible
and near-infrared continuum slope (VNCS) increases while the visible slope (VS)
decreases. In the visible wavelength, the optical effects of space weathering
and TiO2 are identical: both reduce albedo and blue the spectra. This suggests
that developing new TiO2 abundance algorithm is needed. Optical maturity
indices are composition related and hence only locally meaningful. Since
optical remote sensing can only sense the uppermost few microns of regolith and
since this surface tends to be very weathered, the interpretation of surface
composition using optical remote sensing data needs to be carefully evaluated.
Sampling the uppermost surface is suggested.

appropriate time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and
the out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be analytically
continued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically evaluate
real-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the
dynamical mean-field theory in combination with a numerically exact
continuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The results for the single-orbital
model show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment formation in
the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not
show SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and
three-orbital models with nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits
a rapid damping at short times and an approximate power-law decay at longer
times in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating local
moments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\Sigma(\omega) \sim \sqrt{\omega}$.
These results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model,
providing firm evidence for the close relation between the spin-freezing
crossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and the SYK strange metal.

languages. Every regular language has quantum query complexity Theta(1),
~Theta(sqrt n), or Theta(n). The extreme uniformity of regular languages
prevents them from taking any other asymptotic complexity. This is in contrast
to even the context-free languages, which we show can have query complexity
Theta(n^c) for all computable c in [1/2,1]. Our result implies an equivalent
trichotomy for the approximate degree of regular languages, and a
dichotomy---either Theta(1) or Theta(n)---for sensitivity, block sensitivity,
certificate complexity, deterministic query complexity, and randomized query
complexity.
  The heart of the classification theorem is an explicit quantum algorithm
which decides membership in any star-free language in ~O(sqrt n) time. This
well-studied family of the regular languages admits many interesting
characterizations, for instance, as those languages expressible as sentences in
first-order logic over the natural numbers with the less-than relation.
Therefore, not only do the star-free languages capture functions such as OR,
they can also express functions such as ""there exist a pair of 2's such that
everything between them is a 0.""
  Thus, we view the algorithm for star-free languages as a nontrivial
generalization of Grover's algorithm which extends the quantum quadratic
speedup to a much wider range of string-processing algorithms than was
previously known. We show a variety of applications---new quantum algorithms
for dynamic constant-depth Boolean formulas, balanced parentheses nested
constantly many levels deep, binary addition, a restricted word break problem,
and path-discovery in narrow grids---all obtained as immediate consequences of
our classification theorem.

by proposing a memory network fit for long-term lifelong learning scenario,

as well as its historical importance. Such learning of retention agent allows
our long-term episodic memory network to retain memory entries of generic

achieves significant improvements over the memory augmented networks with

the rapid expansion of applications in video surveillance and intelligent
transportation. By recalling the identification process of human vision, we are
aware that there exists a native hierarchical dependency when humans identify
different vehicles. Specifically, humans always firstly determine one vehicle's
coarse-grained category, i.e., the car model/type. Then, under the branch of
the predicted car model/type, they are going to identify specific vehicles by
relying on subtle visual cues, e.g., customized paintings and windshield
stickers, at the fine-grained level. Inspired by the coarse-to-fine
hierarchical process, we propose an end-to-end RNN-based Hierarchical Attention
(RNN-HA) classification model for vehicle re-identification. RNN-HA consists of
three mutually coupled modules: the first module generates image
representations for vehicle images, the second hierarchical module models the
aforementioned hierarchical dependent relationship, and the last attention
module focuses on capturing the subtle visual information distinguishing
specific vehicles from each other. By conducting comprehensive experiments on
two vehicle re-identification benchmark datasets VeRi and VehicleID, we
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods.

spatial-spectral paradigm for HSI denoising. As the new model is hard to

motivated by alternating minimization. This is done by first learning a
low-dimensional projection and the related reduced image from the noisy HSI.
Then, the non-local low-rank denoising and iterative regularization are
developed to refine the reduced image and projection, respectively. Finally,

memory is a key resource. Quantum information processing promises a memory
advantage for stochastic simulation that has been validated in recent

only become accessible in the limit of a large number of parallel simulations,
because the memory registers of individual quantum simulators had the same

nucleation physics, we investigate the effect of material composition and
surface texturing (atomically smooth to nanorough) on the nucleation and growth
mechanism of frost for a range of conditions within the sublimation domain (0 C
to -55C; partial water vapor pressures 6 to 0.02 mbar). Surprisingly, we
observe that on silicon at very cold temperatures-below the homogeneous ice
solidification nucleation limit (< -46 C)-desublimation does not become the
favorable pathway to frosting. Furthermore we show that surface nanoroughness
makes frost formation on silicon more probable. We experimentally demonstrate
at temperatures between -48 C and -55 C that nanotexture with radii of
curvature within one order of magnitude of the critical radius of nucleation
favors frost growth, facilitated by capillary condensation, consistent with
Kelvin's Equation. Our findings show that such nanoscale surface morphology
imposed by design to impart desired functionalities-such as
superhydrophobicity-or from defects, can be highly detrimental for frost
icephobicity at low temperatures and water vapor partial pressures (< 0.05

surface wave against unidirectional flow with a sediment bed. This paper
presents the spatial variation of bed forms induced by the wave-blocking
phenomenon by a suitably tuned uniform fluid flow and a counter-propagating
wave. The occurrence of wave-blocking is confirmed by finding a critical wave
frequency in a particular flow discharge in which the waves are effectively
blocked and is established using the linear dispersion relation. The novelty of
this work is to identify the wave-blocking and its influence on the development
of bed forms over the sediment bed. Interesting bed form signatures are
observed at a transition of bed forms in three zones, with asymmetric ripples
having a steeper slope downstream face induced by the incoming current,
followed by flat sand bars beneath the wave-blocking zone and more symmetric
ripples below the wave-dominated region at the downstream. This phenomenon
suggests that the sediment bed is segmented into three different regions of bed
geometry along the flow. The deviations of mean flows, Reynolds stresses,
turbulent kinetic energy, and power spectral density due to the wave-blocking
phenomenon are presented along the non-uniform flow over sediment bed. The
bottom shear stress, bed roughness and stochastic nature of the bed form
features are also discussed. The results are of relevance to engineers and
geoscientists concerned with contemporary process as well as those interested
in the interpretation of palaeoenvironmental conditions from fossil bed forms.

integrals over unbounded domains $\mathbb{R}_+^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$ using a
special change of variables, so that quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) or sparse grid
rules can be applied to the transformed integrands over the unit cube. We
consider a class of integrands with bounded $L_p$ norm of mixed partial
derivatives of first order, where $p\in[1,+\infty].$
  The main results give sufficient conditions on the change of variables $\nu$
which guarantee that the transformed integrand belongs to the standard Sobolev
space of functions over the unit cube with mixed smoothness of order one. These
conditions depend on $\rho$ and $p$.
  The proposed change of variables is in general different than the standard
change based on the inverse of the cumulative distribution function. We stress
that the standard change of variables leads to integrands over a cube; however,
those integrands have singularities which make the application of QMC and
sparse grids ineffective. Our conclusions are supported by numerical

the most widely used lossless data compressions is Lempel-Zip(LZ) 77 parsing,

is a lossless data compression and computes a sequence of phrases copied from
another substring (target phrase) on either the left or the right position in
an input string. Gagie et al.(LATIN 2018) recently showed that a large gap
exists between the number of smallest bidirectional phrases of a given string

achieved high compression that is smaller than that of LZ77 phrasing for any

modelled by a stochastic differential equation associated with the

of the open quantum system. This memory has slowly-decaying power-law tails.
Such a long-range character of the memory complicates the description of the
resulting real-time dynamics on large time scales. In a numerical simulation,
this problem manifests itself in a `revival', a spurious reflected signal which
appears after a finite time thus invalidating the simulation. In the present
work, we approach this problem and develop a numerical discretization of the
bath without revivals. We find that a crucial role is played by the
singularities of the bath spectral density (e.g. edges of bands): the memory
about the (spectral) behaviour of the open system in the remote past is
completely averaged out (forgotten), except an increasingly small vicinity of
these singular frequencies. Therefore, we introduce the concept of memory
channel, to denote such an irreversible information loss process around a
particular singular frequency. On a technical side, we begin the treatment by
noting that with respect to the memory loss, the quantum field of the bath
should be divided into the following two different parts: the observable and
the virtual quanta. Information about the former is never lost: they contribute
to the trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The only way to avoid the
revival from the observable quanta is to calculate their dynamics exactly. We
do this by employing a stochastic sampling of the Husimi function of the bath.
The other part, the virtual quanta, are always annihilated after a certain
delay time. We construct a dedicated quantum representation for the virtual
states by assigning amplitudes to the delay times before annihilation. It is in
this representation we rigorously define the concept of memory channels.

$D$ is a unital Banach algebra. Under the assumption that $\alpha$ generates a
partial dynamical system $(X,\varphi)$, we establish two kinds of variational
principles for $r(a\alpha)$: using linear extensions of $(X,\varphi)$ and using
Lyapunov exponents associated with ergodic measures for $(X,\varphi)$. This
requires considering (twisted) cocycles over $(X,\varphi)$ with values in an
arbitrary Banach algebra $D$, and thus our analysis can not be reduced to any
of mutliplicative ergodic theorems known so far.
  The established variational principles apply not only to weighted
endomorphisms but also to a vast class of operators acting on Banach spaces

obtained by Kitover, Lebedev, Latushkin, Stepin and others. They are most
efficient when $D=\mathcal{B}(F)$, for a Banach space $F$, and endomorphisms of
$\mathcal{B}(F)$ induced by $\alpha$ are inner isometric. As a by product we
obtain a dynamical variational principle for an arbitrary operator $b\in

  system","132 pages",,,,"math.AP gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, the AdS instability conjecture, put forward by
Dafermos-Holzegel in 2006, has attracted a substantial amount of numerical and
heuristic studies. Following the pioneering work of Bizon-Rostworowski,
research efforts have been mainly focused on the study of the spherically
symmetric Einstein-scalar field system. The first rigorous proof of the
instability of AdS in the simplest spherically symmetric setting, namely for
the Einstein-null dust system, was obtained in [G. Moschidis, A proof of the
instability of AdS for the Einstein-null dust system with an inner mirror,
2017, arXiv:1704.08681]. In that work, the evolution was restricted to the
exterior of an inner mirror placed at $r=r_{0}>0$, in order to circumvent the
trivial break down of the Einstein-null dust system occurring at $r=0$; in that
setting, additional considerations necessitated $r_{0}$ to shrink to $0$ with
the size of the initial perturbation.
  In this paper, we establish the instability of AdS for the Einstein-massless
Vlasov system in spherical symmetry. This will be the first proof of the AdS
instability conjecture for an Einstein--matter system which is well-posed for
regular initial data in the standard sense, without the addition of an inner
mirror. New difficulties associated with the Einstein-massless Vlasov system
(such as the need for control on the paths of non-radial geodesics in a large
curvature regime) force us to develop a strategy of proof which is
fundamentally different from the one employed in the case of the Einstein--null
dust system, albeit still based on the interaction of beams of matter in
physical space.

level of performance of these methods significantly depends on a set of
parameters, which can be estimated through computationally expensive and
time-consuming methods. In contrast, deep learning offers very generic and
efficient architectures, at the expense of explainability, since it is often
used as a black-box, without any fine control over its output. Deep unfolding
provides a convenient approach to combine variational-based and deep learning
approaches. Starting from a variational formulation for image restoration, we
develop iRestNet, a neural network architecture obtained by unfolding a
proximal interior point algorithm. Hard constraints, encoding desirable
properties for the restored image, are incorporated into the network thanks to
a logarithmic barrier, while the barrier parameter, the stepsize, and the
penalization weight are learned by the network. We derive explicit expressions
for the gradient of the proximity operator for various choices of constraints,
which allows training iRestNet with gradient descent and backpropagation. In
addition, we provide theoretical results regarding the stability of the network

emphasize: i) the physics in low dimensions where exact solutions can be
obtained, ii) the physics at phase boundaries where spectacular phenomena can
occur due to competing interactions of the two phases around the boundary. This
competition causes a frustration. I will concentrate my attention to thin films
and phenomena occurring near the boundary of two phases of different
symmetries. The case of two-dimensional (2D) systems is in fact the limiting
case of thin films with a monolayer. Naturally, I will treat this case at the
beginning. After a short introduction on frustrated spin systems, I show
several 2D frustrated Ising spin systems which can be exactly solved by using
vertex models. These systems contain most of the spectacular effects due to the
frustration: high ground-state degeneracy, existence of several phases in the
ground-state phase diagram, multiple phase transitions with increasing
temperature, reentrance, disorder lines, partial disorder at equilibrium.
Evidences of such effects in non solvable models are also shown and discussed.
Thin films are next presented with different aspects: surface elementary
excitations (surface spin-waves), surface phase transition and criticality.
Several examples are shown and discussed. New results on skyrmions in thin
films and superlattices are also displayed.

favors clustering tasks via deep neural networks, has achieved remarkable
performance in image clustering applications. However, the existing deep
clustering algorithms generally need the number of clusters in advance, which
is usually unknown in real-world tasks. In addition, the initial cluster
centers in the learned feature space are generated by $k$-means. This only
works well on spherical clusters and probably leads to unstable clustering
results. In this paper, we propose a two-stage deep density-based image
clustering (DDC) framework to address these issues. The first stage is to train
a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract low-dimensional feature
representations from high-dimensional image data, and then apply t-SNE to
further reduce the data to a 2-dimensional space favoring density-based
clustering algorithms. The second stage is to apply the developed density-based
clustering technique on the 2-dimensional embedded data to automatically
recognize an appropriate number of clusters with arbitrary shapes. Concretely,
a number of local clusters are generated to capture the local structures of
clusters, and then are merged via their density relationship to form the final
clustering result. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDC achieves
comparable or even better clustering performance than state-of-the-art deep
clustering methods, even though the number of clusters is not given.

samples. To combat adversarial strategies, numerous defensive techniques have
been proposed. Among these, a promising approach is to use randomness in order
to make the classification process unpredictable and presumably harder for the
adversary to control. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of randomized
defenses against adversarial samples. To this end, we categorize existing
state-of-the-art adversarial strategies into three attacker models of
increasing strength, namely blackbox, graybox, and whitebox (a.k.a.~adaptive)
attackers. We also devise a lightweight randomization strategy for image
classification based on feature squeezing, that consists of pre-processing the
classifier input by embedding randomness within each feature, before applying
feature squeezing. We evaluate the proposed defense and compare it to other
randomized techniques in the literature via thorough experiments. Our results
indeed show that careful integration of randomness can be effective against
both graybox and blackbox attacks without significantly degrading the accuracy
of the underlying classifier. However, our experimental results offer strong
evidence that in the present form such randomization techniques cannot deter a
whitebox adversary that has access to all classifier parameters and has full
knowledge of the defense. Our work thoroughly and empirically analyzes the
impact of randomization techniques against all classes of adversarial
strategies.

opportunities for studying many key issues of condensed matter physics, such as
co-existence and mutual conversions of excitonic complexes, fundamental optical
processes associated with their conversions, and their roles in the celebrated
Mott transition. Recent lasing demonstrations in 2D materials raise important
questions about the existence and origin of optical gain and possible roles of
excitonic complexes. While lasing occurred at extremely low densities dominated
by various excitonic complexes, optical gain was observed in the only
experiment at densities several orders of magnitude higher, exceeding the Mott
density. Here, we report a new gain mechanism involving charged excitons or
trions well below the Mott density in 2D molybdenum ditelluride. Our combined
experimental and modeling study not only reveals the complex interplays of
excitonic complexes well below the Mott transition, but also provides
foundation for lasing at extremely low excitation levels, important for future
energy efficient photonic devices.

nickel templates and their compressive responses were measured over a range of

power law scaling of elastic modulus and yield strength versus relative density
suggests that the cell walls of the graphitic foam deform by bending. The
length scale of the unit cell of the foam is set by the length of the struts
comprising the cell wall, and is termed level I. The cell walls comprise hollow
triangular tubes, and bending of these strut-like tubes involves axial
stretching of the tube walls. This length scale is termed level II. In turn,
the tube walls form a wavy stack of graphitic layers, and this waviness induces
interlayer shear of the graphitic layers when the tube walls are subjected to
axial stretch. The thickness of the tube wall defines the third length scale,
termed level III. We show that the addition of a thin, flexible ceramic Al2O3
scaffold stiffens and strengthens the foam, yet preserves the power law
scaling. The hierarchical model gives fresh insight into the mechanical
properties of foams with cell walls made from emergent 2D layered solids.

existing computational approaches to solve this problem usually require
time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations of the reaction dynamics. Therefore
these simulation-based approaches can only be expected to work over finite
time-intervals, while it is often of interest in applications to examine the
sensitivity values at the steady-state after the Markov chain has relaxed to
its stationary distribution. The aim of this paper is to present a
computational method for the estimation of steady-state parameter

developed stationary Finite State Projection (sFSP) algorithm [J. Chem. Phys.

approach to numerically solve the Poisson equation and this yields an efficient

thanks to the development of effective point cloud-based learning frameworks,
such as PointNet and its extensions. However, existing methods rely heavily on
fully connected layers, which introduce a significant amount of parameters,
making the network harder to train and prone to overfitting problems. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for point set feature
learning by leveraging a nonlinear activation layer encoded by Radial Basis
Function (RBF) kernels. Unlike PointNet variants, that fail to recognize local
point patterns, our approach explicitly models the spatial distribution of
point clouds by aggregating features from sparsely distributed RBF kernels. A
typical RBF kernel, e.g. Gaussian function, naturally penalizes long-distance
response and is only activated by neighboring points. Such localized response
generates highly discriminative features given different point distributions.
In addition, our framework allows the joint optimization of kernel distribution
and its receptive field, automatically evolving kernel configurations in an
end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that the proposed network with a single RBF
layer can outperform the state-of-the-art Pointnet++ in terms of classification
accuracy for 3D object recognition tasks. Moreover, the introduction of
nonlinear mappings significantly reduces the number of network parameters and
computational cost, enabling significantly faster training and a deployable
point cloud recognition solution on portable devices with limited resources.

us to obtain measurements of multiple objects with a range of magnitudes in
each telescope pointing. We observed 65 objects with m_r = 22.6--25.5 mag in
just six pointings, allowing 20--24 visits of each pointing over the two
nights. Our sample, all discovered in the recent Outer Solar System Origins
Survey (OSSOS), span absolute magnitudes H_r = 6.2--10.8 mag and thus
investigates smaller objects than previous light curve projects have typically
studied. Our data supports the existence of a correlation between light curve
amplitude and absolute magnitude seen in other works, but does not support a
correlation between amplitude and orbital inclination. Our sample includes a
number of objects from different dynamical populations within the
trans-Neptunian region, but we do not find any relationship between variability
and dynamical class. We were only able to estimate periods for 12 objects in
the sample and found that a longer baseline of observations is required for
reliable period analysis. We find that 31 objects (just under half of our

discrepancies in the first layers near the boundary. To reduce these
discrepancies, we propose a new boundary condition mixing bounce back for the
oblique links and anti bounce back for the normal link. This boundary condition
is able to enforce both pressure and tangential velocity on the boundary.

austenite. Particularly, it has been shown that a recently developed
heat-treatment technique called Quenching and Partitioning (Q\&P) stabilises
austenite effectively. In the present work, the phase-field approach is adopted
to simulate the phase transformation and carbon diffusion, which respectively
accompanies the quenching and partitioning process of the polycrystalline Fe-C
system. By incorporating the chemical driving-force from the CALPHAD database,
the elastic phase-field model, which recovers the sharp-interface solutions,
simulates the martensite (alpha') transformation at three different quenching
temperatures. The resulting martensite volume-fractions are in complete
agreement with the analytical predictions. For the first time, in this study,
the constrained carbon equilibrium (CCE) condition is introduced in the
polycrystalline set-up to yield the predicted partitioning endpoints. Under the
CCE condition, the carbon partitioning in two alloys of varying composition is
analysed through the phase-field model which employs chemical potential as the
dynamic variable. The volume fraction and distribution of retained austenite is
determined from the carbon distribution and its temporal evolution during the
partitioning is investigated. It is identified that in the initial stages of
partitioning carbon gets accumulated in the austenite ($\gamma$) along the
$\gamma\alpha'$-interface, owing to the substantial difference in the
diffusivities and CCE endpoints. This accumulation stabilises the austenite
adjacent to the interface. However, depending on the martensite volume-fraction
and the alloy composition, the evolution of the stabilised austenite varies.
Furthermore, the influence of the phase distribution on the kinetics of the
temporal evolution of retained austenite is elucidated.

retrieve both the speckle field and the object map via a stochastic approach to
inverse problem (taking into account the statistics of the noise) in the
Bayesian framework (using parametric regularization). One fundamental aspect of
MEDUSAE is that the model of the coronagraphic PSF is analytic and parametrized
by the optical path difference which, contrary to the phase, is achromatic. The
speckle field is thus estimated by a phase retrieval, using the spectral
diversity to disentangle the planetary signal from the residual starlight. The
object map is restored via a non-myopic deconvolution under adequate
regularization. The basis of this MEDUSAE method have been previously published
and validated on an inverse crime. In this communication, we present its
application to realistic simulated data, in preparation for real data
application. The solution we proposed to attempt bypassing the main differences

clusters, walls, filaments, groups and field galaxies. The question of spatial
organization of all these components remains open despite of a number of
recently developed methods of LSS analysis. In this paper we introduce new
continuous structural parameter of galaxy distribution for the determinig of
the type of LSS surrounding. This parameter is based on comparison of the
radial distribution of galaxies around the certain point with the uniform one.
Our method for structure parameter calculation is based on the distribution of
1000 closets galaxies to the selected one. Such number was selected because
most galaxy clusters contains up to 1000 galaxies. When we exceed 1000th
closest galaxy we will leave possible cluster or filament and will pass to
another type of LSS. We suppose that in uniform distribution of galaxies their
number should increase as third power a distance, similar to luminosity.
Therefore the inverse dependence of galaxy distance from number should be cubic
root. New structural parameter was introduced as the difference of this
dependence of cubic root. The main type of cosmic surrounding for a galaxy is
defined by the value and the sign of such structural parameter. If a galaxy lie
in a cluster the distances of nearby galaxies will be less than cubic root. We
integrated distance difference for all 1000 galaxies and get negative stuctural
parameter in this case. In the case of void the structural parameter will be
positive. New parameter was calculated for sky distribution of SDSS galaxies at
distances from 50 to 150 Mpc. Analysing obtained values, we come to conclusion
that our structural parameter can be used for the division of LSS components
and extragalactic filament detection.

jointly training the CCM-AAE to maximise the membership degree of the

active galactic nuclei (AGNs), are considered to be a key mechanism for AGN
feedback. In this scenario, UFO kinetic energy is transferred into the cold and
extended molecular outflow observed at the mm/sub-mm wavelength, which blows
away the gas and suppresses star formation and accretion onto the central black
hole (BH). However, the energy transfer between the inner UFO and the outer
molecular outflow has not yet fully studied mainly due to the limited sample.
In this paper, we performed comparison of their kinetic energy using the
mm/sub-mm published data and the X-ray archival data. Among fourteen Seyfert
galaxies whose molecular outflows are detected in the IRAM/PdBI data, eight
targets are bright enough to perform spectral fitting in X-ray, and we have
detected UFO absorption lines in six targets with 90% significance level, using
XMM-Newton and Suzaku satellites. The time-averaged UFO kinetic energy was
derived from the spectral fitting. As a result, we have found that the
energy-transfer rate (kinetic energy ratio of the molecular outflow to the UFO)
ranges from $\sim7\times10^{-3}$ to $\sim$1, and has a negative correlation
with the BH mass, which shows that the AGN feedback is more efficient in the
lower mass BHs. This tendency is consistent with the theoretical prediction
that the cooling time scale of the outflowing gas becomes longer than the flow
time scale when the BH mass is smaller.

dependencities in filament structure can give answer to more general questions
about origin of structures in the Universe. This becomes possible because,
according to current picture of Universe, one could simulate the evolution of
Universe until its very beginning or vice versa. According to current
cosmological hydrodynamical theories a number of computer simulations of LSS
were performed to describe its properties. In this work we consider alternative
variant of simulating the distribution of matter that is very similar to real.
We simulated two-dimensional galaxy distribution on the sky using random
distributions of clusters and single galaxies. The main assumption was that
matter clusterised to initial density fluctuations with uniform distribution.
According to Zeldovich theory, low-dimensional anisotropies should increase,
that corresponds to appearance of filaments in 2D case. Thus we generated a net
of filaments between clusters with certain length limits. Real galaxy
distribution was simulated by random changing galaxy positions in filaments and
clusters. We generated radial distributions of galaxies in clusters taking into
account the surrounding and add uniform distribution of isolated galaxies in
voids. Our model has been coordinated with SDSS galaxy distribution with using
two-point angular correlation function. Parameters of random distributions were
found for the case of equality of correlation function slope for the model and
for observational data.

ADS 4022, and we found that it is a quadruple system, composed of two

previously recognized as a spectroscopic binary.
  We collected a number of high-resolution optical and IR spectra to calculate
the radial velocities (RVs) and later combined them with MITSuME and ASAS

curves modelled with our own procedure V2FIT. Light curve modelling was

1.03(2) R$_\odot$ primary and a 0.60(2) M$_\odot$, 0.59(2) R$_\odot$ secondary.

sense minimal requirements of any causal explanation in these scenarios. In

the use of \textit{ab initio} methods. In this work, we define a simplified

replacing the molecular cations with inorganic atoms. We can thus apply
state-of-the-art, parameter-free and predictive \textit{ab initio} methods like
the GW method and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to obtain the excitonic states of
a model 2D perovskite. We find that optical properties of 2D perovskites are

Moreover, the optical absorption is carried out at the bromine and lead atoms

distance indicators of objects (for example type Ia supernovae) with their
redshift, often illustrated on a Hubble diagram. Comparing the observed
correlation with a homogeneous model is one of the key pieces of evidence for
dark energy. The presence of cosmic structures introduces a bias and scatter,
mainly due to gravitational lensing and peculiar velocities, but also due to
smaller non-linear relativistic contributions which are more difficult to
account for. For the first time we perform ray tracing onto halos in a
relativistic N-body simulation. Our simulation is the largest that takes into
account all leading-order corrections from general relativity in the evolution
of structure, and we present a novel methodology for working out the non-linear
projection of that structure onto the observer's past light cone. We show that
the mean of the bias in the Hubble diagram is indeed as small as expected from
perturbation theory. However, the distribution of sources is significantly
skewed with a very long tail of highly magnified objects and we illustrate that
the bias of cosmological parameters strongly depends on the function of
distance which we consider.

shortcomings of the coordinates identification due to the Earth axis

nuclei are characterized by processes with significant. Such processes quite
often are followed by X-ray emission generation. The purpose of this work is to
consider X-ray emission of ICRF sources and features of their possible proper
motions. Among 295 selected reference frames of the system we identified 54
X-ray sources which were observed by space observatory XMM Newton and noticed
rapid variability of the blazars 2E 2673 (W Com) and 2E 1802 which enables to
conclude that they have some very active processes in the sources centers. With
regards to the future more detailed analysis we beleive that evidences of the
objects proper motion could be found in their spectra. Based on the constructed
luminosity and spectral graphs we could conclude that apart from above
mentioned AGNs rest 52 objects do not show veriability and special attention
should be paid to blazars within ICRF system development and use. Major part of
the X-ray sources between the reference frames are stable.

architectures can be interpreted as forward Euler discretizations of a
nonlinear initial value problem whose time-dependent control variables
represent the weights of the neural network. Hence, training a ResNet can be
cast as an optimal control problem of the associated dynamical system. For
similar time-dependent optimal control problems arising in engineering
applications, parallel-in-time methods have shown notable improvements in

classical (sequential) forward and backward propagation through the network
layers by a parallel nonlinear multigrid iteration applied to the layer domain.
This adds a new dimension of parallelism across layers that is attractive when
training very deep networks. From this basic idea, we derive multiple
layer-parallel methods. The most efficient version employs a simultaneous
optimization approach where updates to the network parameters are based on
inexact gradient information in order to speed up the training process. Using
numerical examples from supervised classification, we demonstrate that the new

enables layer-parallelism and thus provides speedup over layer-serial methods

may contain at least three times more water than the oceans. This crust water
is found in the form of phyllosilicates, whose origin probably differs from
that of the oceans. We test the possibility to form phyllosilicates in
protoplanetary disks, which can be the building blocks of terrestrial planets.
We developed an exploratory rate-based warm surface chemistry model where water
from the gas-phase can chemisorb on dust grain surfaces and subsequently
diffuse into the silicate cores. We apply the phyllosilicate formation model to
a zero-dimensional chemical model and to a 2D protoplanetary disk model
(ProDiMo). The disk model includes in addition to the cold and warm surface
chemistry continuum and line radiative transfer, photoprocesses
(photodissociation, photoionization, and photodesorption), gas-phase cold and
warm chemistry including three-body reactions, and detailed thermal balance.
Despite the high energy barrier for water chemisorption on silicate grain
surfaces and for diffusion into the core, the chemisorption sites at the
surfaces can be occupied by a hydroxyl bond (-OH) at all gas and dust
temperatures from 80 to 700 K for a gas density of 2E4 cm^-3. The chemisorption
sites in the silicate cores are occupied at temperatures between 250 and 700 K.
At higher temperatures thermal desorption of chemisorbed water occurs. The
occupation efficiency is only limited by the maximum water uptake of the
silicate. The timescales for complete hydration are at most 1E5 years for 1 mm
radius grains at a gas density of 1E8 cm^-3. Phyllosilicates can be formed on
dust grains at the dust coagulation stage in protoplanetary disks within 1 Myr.
It is however not clear whether the amount of phyllosilicate formed by warm
surface chemistry is sufficient compared to that found in Solar System objects.

we propose that the antiparticles are effectively produced in interactions of
primary CRs with the surrounding gas not only in the interstellar medium (ISM)
but also inside the accelerators. Secondly, we postulate the existence of two
source populations injecting CRs into the ISM with different, (1) soft (close
to $FI \propto E^{-2.3}$) and (2) hard ($FII \propto E^{-1.8}$ or harder),
energy distributions. Assuming that CRs in the 2nd population of accelerators
accumulate ""grammage"" of the order of $1 \ \rm g/cm^2$ before their leakage
into ISM, we can explain the energy distributions and absolute fluxes of both
positrons and antiprotons, as well as the fluxes of secondary nuclei of the
(Li,Be,B) group. The superposition of contributions of two source populations
also explains the reported hardening of the spectra of CR protons and nuclei
above 200 GV. The 2nd source population accelerating CRs with a rate at the
level below 10 percent of the power of the 1st source population, can be
responsible for the highest energy protons and nuclei of Galactic CRs up to the
""knee"" around $10^{15} \ \rm eV$.

a feature-agnostic manner to guide model compression. Kernel clustering is
further conducted based on the KSE indicator to accomplish high-precision CNN
compression. KSE is capable of simultaneously compressing each layer in an
efficient way, which is significantly faster compared to previous data-driven
feature map pruning methods. We comprehensively evaluate the compression and

to recognize handwritten and printed text, eliminate noisy effects, identify
the type of documents and detect visual entities like tables, lines and boxes.
Deep Reader maps the extracted entities into a rich relational schema so as to
capture all the relevant relationships between entities (words, textboxes,
lines etc) detected in the document. Relevant information and fields can then
be extracted from the document by writing SQL queries on top of the
relationship tables. A natural language based interface is added on top of the
relationship schema so that a non-technical user, specifying the queries in
natural language, can fetch the information with minimal effort. In this paper,
we also demonstrate many different capabilities of Deep Reader and report
results on a real-world use case.

graphs, electronic commerce etc. demand efficient and scalable capability to
process an ever increasing volume of graph-structured data. To meet the
challenge, two mainstream distributed programming models, vertex-centric (VC)
and subgraph-centric (SC) were proposed. Compared to the VC model, the SC model
converges faster with less communication overhead on well-partitioned graphs,
and is easy to program due to the ""think like a graph"" philosophy. The edge-cut
method is considered as a natural choice of subgraph-centric model for graph
partitioning, and has been adopted by Giraph++, Blogel and GRAPE. However, the
edge-cut method causes significant performance bottleneck for processing large
scale power-law graphs. Thus, the SC model is less competitive in practice. In
this paper, we present an innovative distributed graph computing framework,
DRONE (Distributed gRaph cOmputiNg Engine). It combines the subgraph-centric
model and the vertex-cut graph partitioning strategy. Experiments show that
DRONE outperforms the state-of-art distributed graph computing engines on
real-world graphs and synthetic power-law graphs. DRONE is capable of scaling
up to process one-trillion-edge synthetic power-law graphs, which is orders of
magnitude larger than previously reported by existing SC-based frameworks.

single-particle-box (SPB) into two equal parts. Adiabatic insertion of a
barrier in the center of a SPB in order to make two compartments which each
have probability 1/2 to find the particle in it is one of the key steps for a
Szilard engine. However, any asymmetry between the volume of the compartments
due to an off-center insertion of the barrier results in a particle that is
fully localized in the larger compartment, in the adiabatic limit. We show that
rather than exactly splitting the eigenfunctions in half by a symmetric
barrier, one can use a non-adiabatic insertion of an asymmetric barrier to
induce excitations to the first excited state of the full box. As the barrier
height goes to infinity the excited state of the full box becomes the ground
state of one of the new boxes. Thus, we can achieve close to exact splitting of
the probability between the two compartments using the more realistic
non-adiabatic, not perfectly centered barrier, rather than the idealized
adiabatic and central barrier normally assumed.

acquisitions have distinct drawbacks on either human or animal MR systems. On
clinical scanners, 3D imaging is suboptimal for localized fMRI applications,
and also results in distortions, blurring, and increased sensitivity to motion
or physiological noise. On pre-clinical systems, 3D acquisitions have low
temporal resolution due to limited acceleration options, while single slice
offers insufficient coverage. The aim of the present study was to implement a
multi-slice bSSFP acquisition with Cartesian read-out to obtain non-distorted
BOLD fMRI activation maps in the human and rat brain at ultra-high field. We
show that the bSSFP signal characteristics are preserved in a new

SNR that matches that of 3D-bSSFP, resulting in - at least - equal performance.

similar sensitivity to gradient-echo EPI for task fMRI, while benefitting from
much reduced distortions and drop-outs. The advantages of passband bSSFP at 14

benzene: Calculated spectra reproduce experimental data and are much more
accurate than standard global harmonic approaches, confirming the significance
of anharmonicity. Moreover, the extended method provides a tool to quantify the
Herzberg-Teller contribution: we show that in phenyl radical, anharmonicity
outweighs the Herzberg-Teller contribution, whereas in benzene, the
Herzberg-Teller contribution is essential, since the transition is
electronically forbidden and Condon approximation yields a zero spectrum.
Surprisingly, both adiabatic harmonic spectra outperform those of the vertical
harmonic model, which describes the Franck-Condon region better. Finally, we
provide a simple recipe for orientationally averaging spectra, valid beyond

includes limb-darkening correction, removal of non-uniform filter transmission,
and determination of HeI Doppler velocities.
  Chromospheric full-disk filtergrams are often obtained with Lyot filters,
which may display non-uniform transmission causing large-scale intensity
variations across the solar disk. Removal of a 2D symmetric limb-darkening
function from full-disk images results in a flat background. However,
transmission artifacts remain and are even more distinct in these
contrast-enhanced images. Zernike polynomials are uniquely appropriate to fit
these large-scale intensity variations of the background. The Zernike
coefficients show a distinct temporal evolution for ChroTel data, which is
likely related to the telescope's alt-azimuth mount that introduces image
rotation. In addition, applying this calibration to sets of seven filtergrams
that cover the HeI triplet facilitates determining chromospheric Doppler
velocities. To validate the method, we use three data sets with varying levels
of solar activity. The Doppler velocities are benchmarked with respect to
co-temporal high-resolution spectroscopic data of the GREGOR Infrared
Spectrograph (GRIS). Furthermore, this technique can be applied to ChroTel
H$\alpha$ and CaII K data. The calibration method for ChroTel filtergrams can
be easily adapted to other full-disk data exhibiting unwanted large-scale
variations. The spectral region of the HeI triplet is a primary choice for
high-resolution near-infrared spectropolarimetry. Here, the improved
calibration of ChroTel data will provide valuable context data.

e-commerce shopping experience. For Etsy, an online marketplace with over 50
million handmade and vintage items, users come to rely on personalized
recommendations to surface relevant items from its massive inventory. One
hallmark of Etsy's shopping experience is the multitude of ways in which a user
can interact with an item they are interested in: they can view it, favorite
it, add it to a collection, add it to cart, purchase it, etc. We hypothesize
that the different ways in which a user interacts with an item indicates
different kinds of intent. Consequently, a user's recommendations should be
based not only on the item from their past activity, but also the way in which
they interacted with that item. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
learning interaction-based item embeddings that encode the co-occurrence
patterns of not only the item itself, but also the interaction type. The
learned embeddings give us a convenient way of approximating the likelihood
that one item-interaction pair would co-occur with another by way of a simple

retrieval. While the preferences of rankers can be inferred by interleaving
methods, the problem of how to effectively choose the ranker pair that
generates the interleaved list without degrading the user experience too much
is still challenging. On the one hand, if two rankers have not been compared
enough, the inferred preference can be noisy and inaccurate. On the other, if
two rankers are compared too many times, the interleaving process inevitably
hurts the user experience too much. This dilemma is known as the exploration
versus exploitation tradeoff. It is captured by the $K$-armed dueling bandit
problem, which is a variant of the $K$-armed bandit problem, where the feedback
comes in the form of pairwise preferences. Today's deployed search systems can
evaluate a large number of rankers concurrently, and scaling effectively in the
presence of numerous rankers is a critical aspect of $K$-armed dueling bandit
problems.
  In this paper, we focus on solving the large-scale online ranker evaluation
problem under the so-called Condorcet assumption, where there exists an optimal
ranker that is preferred to all other rankers. We propose Merge Double Thompson
Sampling (MergeDTS), which first utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy that
localizes the comparisons carried out by the algorithm to small batches of
rankers, and then employs Thompson Sampling (TS) to reduce the comparisons
between suboptimal rankers inside these small batches. The effectiveness
(regret) and efficiency (time complexity) of MergeDTS are extensively evaluated
using examples from the domain of online evaluation for web search. Our main
finding is that for large-scale Condorcet ranker evaluation problems, MergeDTS
outperforms the state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms.

The feature is assumed to associate with a single speaker at each
time-frequency bin. Second, a complex Gaussian mixture model (CGMM) is used as
a generative model of the features. The weight of each CGMM component
represents the probability that this component corresponds to an active
speaker, and is adaptively estimated with an online optimization algorithm.
Finally, taking the CGMM component weights as observations, a Bayesian

active speakers and the localization miss measurements, by introducing speaker
birth and sleeping processes. The experiments carried out on the development

time-consuming task. This is especially true, if the animals look very similar

most cases the animals stay at one place only for a short period of time during
which the animal needs to be identified for knowing whether it is important to

identifying elephants to speed up this process would be of great benefit. In

mass. In this paper, we demonstrate that the situation is considerably
different in models that extend the Higgs sector by a real scalar singlet.
Based on effective-theory arguments, the extra scalar is always allowed to
couple to the heavy neutrinos via singlet Yukawa terms. This opens up new RHN
decay channels leading to larger $CP$ violation as well as to a stronger
departure from thermal equilibrium during leptogenesis. As a consequence, the
baryon asymmetry can be generated for a lightest RHN mass as low as 500 GeV and
without the need for a highly degenerate RHN mass spectrum. In fact, the
requirement of successful leptogenesis via the Higgs portal coupling singles
out an interesting parameter region that can be probed in on-going and future
experiments. We derive a semianalytical fit function for the final baryon
asymmetry that allows for an efficient study of parameter space, thus enabling
us to identify viable parameter regions. Our results are applicable to a wide

procedure in the sense of Nelson (1966) and Parisi and Wu (1981). Our proof
uses in a fundamental way the representation of the law of the SPDE as a

function via pointwise Bernoulli tests. We provide a scalable algorithm for
efficiently solving this problem with rigorous guarantees. In particular, we
prove the convergence rate of our posterior update rule to the true probability
function in L2-norm. Moreover, we allow the Bernoulli tests to depend on
contextual features and provide a modified inference engine with provable
guarantees for this novel setting. Numerical results show that the empirical

task. It specifically needs to address two problems: (1) Both face and body
contain useful cues regarding whether a subject is deceptive. How to
effectively fuse the two is thus key to the effectiveness of an ADD model. (2)
Real-life deceptive samples are hard to collect; learning with limited training
data thus challenges most deep learning based ADD models. In this work, both
problems are addressed. Specifically, for face-body multimodal learning, a
novel face-focused cross-stream network (FFCSN) is proposed. It differs
significantly from the popular two-stream networks in that: (a) face detection
is added into the spatial stream to capture the facial expressions explicitly,
and (b) correlation learning is performed across the spatial and temporal
streams for joint deep feature learning across both face and body. To address
the training data scarcity problem, our FFCSN model is trained with both meta
learning and adversarial learning. Extensive experiments show that our FFCSN
model achieves state-of-the-art results. Further, the proposed FFCSN model as
well as its robust training strategy are shown to be generally applicable to
other human-centric video analysis tasks such as emotion recognition from
user-generated videos.

mainly due to looped/meshed operation, switch between grid-connected and

paper investigates a plug-and-play protection solution for overhead
distribution systems with such variable operation conditions, employing
existing numerical relay capabilities. This solution is applied by designing
plug-and-play, communication-assisted, multifunctional relays with integrated
protection element settings, which apply universally to all distribution system
conditions, rendering the protection scheme independent of a specific system.
Hence, the need for user-defined settings or future revisions due to system
changes is eliminated. The scheme ensures coordination between main line relays
and backup protection of laterals, without a coordination study. There is no
need to replace or modify existing lateral protection means for this purpose;
only their known time-overcurrent curves are uploaded to the relays by the
user. The scheme is described and evaluated through simulations in two test
systems. Meaningful conclusions are finally derived.

$\beta$-reduction, complementing its execution with a capture-avoiding exchange
of terms for bound variables. Alas, the meta-level definition of substitution,
masking a non-trivial computation, turns $\beta$-reduction into an atomic
rewriting rule, despite its varying operational complexity. In the current
paper we propose a somewhat indirect average-case analysis of substitution
resolution in the classic $\lambda$-calculus, based on the quantitative
analysis of substitution in $\lambda\upsilon$, an extension of
$\lambda$-calculus internalising the $\upsilon$-calculus of explicit
substitutions. Within this framework, we show that for any fixed $n \geq 0$,
the probability that a uniformly random, conditioned on size,
$\lambda\upsilon$-term $\upsilon$-normalises in $n$ normal-order (i.e.
leftmost-outermost) reduction steps tends to a computable limit as the term
size tends to infinity. For that purpose, we establish an effective hierarchy
$\left(\mathscr{G}_n\right)_n$ of regular tree grammars partitioning
$\upsilon$-normalisable terms into classes of terms normalising in $n$
normal-order rewriting steps. The main technical ingredient in our construction
is an inductive approach to the construction of $\mathscr{G}_{n+1}$ out of
$\mathscr{G}_n$ based, in turn, on the algorithmic construction of finite
intersection partitions, inspired by Robinson's unification algorithm. Finally,
we briefly discuss applications of our approach to other term rewriting
systems, focusing on two closely related formalisms, i.e. the full

to the modification of curve energy stated by Amari and Nagaoka for a smooth
manifold $\mathrm{M}$ endowed with a dual structure
$(\mathrm{g},\nabla,\nabla^*)$, we consider $\nabla$ and $\nabla^*$ kinetic
energies. Then, we prove that a recently introduced canonical divergence and
its dual function coincide with Hamilton principal functions associated with
suitable Lagrangian functions when $(\mathrm{M},\mathrm{g},\nabla,\nabla^*)$ is
dually flat. Corresponding dynamical systems are studied and the tangent
dynamics is outlined in terms of the Riemannian gradient of the canonical

geodesics connecting any two points sufficiently close to each other.
Application to the standard Gaussian model is also investigated.

density distribution of exoplanets is crucial to make progress in the
understanding of exoplanetary formation, migration and habitability. However,
the directly measurable mass and radius values offer little constraint on
interior structure, because the inverse problem is highly degenerate. Therefore
there is a clear need for a third observable of exoplanet interiors. This third
observable can be the $k_2$ fluid Love number which measures the central mass
concentration of an exoplanet. Aims. The aims of this paper are (i) to develop
a basic model to fit the long-term radial velocity and TTV variations caused by
tidal interactions, (ii) to apply the model to the WASP-18Ab system, and (iii)
to estimate the Love number of the planet. Methods. Archival radial velocity,
transit and occultation timing data are collected and fitted via the model
introduced here. Results. The best model fit to the archival radial velocity
and timing data of WASP-18Ab was obtained with a Love number of the massive
($\sim 10 M_\mathrm{Jup}$) hot Jupiter WASP-18Ab: $k_{2,Love} =
0.62^{+0.55}_{-0.19}$. This causes apsidal motion in the system, at a rate of
$\sim0.0087\pm0.0033^\circ / \mathrm{days} \approxeq 31.3\pm11.8$
arcseconds/day. When checking possible causes of periastron precession, other
than the relativistic term or the non-spherical shape of the components, we
found a companion star to the WASP-18 system, named WASP-18B which is a
probable M6.5V dwarf with $\sim 0.1~M_\odot$ at 3519 AU distance from the
transit host star. We also find that small orbital eccentricities may be real,
rather than an apparent effect caused by the non spherical stellar shape.

modern electronic and information technology. Quantum materials with novel
electronic and optical properties have been proposed as the next frontier, but
much remains to be discovered to actualize the promise. Here we report the
first observation of topological quantum properties of chiral crystals in the
RhSi family. We demonsrate that this material hosts novel phase of matter
exhibiting nearly ideal topological surface properties that emerge as a
consequence of the crystals' structural chirality or handedness. We also
demonstrate that the electrons on the surface of this crystal show a highly
unusual helicoid structure that spirals around two high-symmetry momenta
signalling its topological electronic chirality. Such helicoid Fermi arcs on
the surface experimentally characterize the topological charges of $\pm{2}$,
which arise from the bulk chiral fermions. The existence of bulk high-fold
degenerate fermions are guaranteed by the crystal symmetries, however, in order
to determine the topological charge in the chiral crystals it is essential to
identify and study the helical arc states. Remarkably, these topological
conductors we discovered exhibit helical Fermi arcs which are of length $\pi$,
stretching across the entire Brillouin zone and orders of magnitude larger than
those found in all known Weyl semimetals. Our results demonstrate novel
electronic topological state of matter on a structurally chiral crystal
featuring helicoid Fermi arc surface states. The exotic electronic chiral
fermion state realised in these materials can be used to detect a quantised

plane-wave expansion method, we calculate the dispersion relations of the 3D
cavity superlattice with the cubic inverse woodpile structure that reveal five
coupled-cavity bands, typical of quadrupole-like resonances. For three out of
five bands, we observe that the dispersion bandwidth is significantly larger in
the $(k_x, k_z)$-diagonal directions than in other directions. To explain the
directionality of the dispersion bandwidth, we employ the tight-binding method
from which we derive coupling coefficients in 3D. For all converged
coupled-cavity bands, we find that light hops predominantly in a few
high-symmetry directions including the Cartesian $(x, y, z)$ directions,
therefore we propose the name ""Cartesian light"". Such 3D Cartesian hopping of
light in a band gap yields propagation as superlattice Bloch modes that differ
fundamentally from the conventional 3D spatially-extended Bloch wave
propagation in crystals, from light tunneling through a band gap, from
coupled-resonator optical waveguiding, and also from light diffusing at the

X$^\prime$ a 4$d$ element. Along with the search for new materials for
spintronics applications, the trends in structural, electronic, magnetic

studies with the compounds in the quaternary series
CoX$^{\prime}$Y$^{\prime}$Si with X$^{\prime}$ materials from 3$d$ and 4$d$
transition metal series in the periodic table. We observe that the
half-metallic behaviour depends primarily on the crystal structure type based
on atomic arrangements and the number of valence electrons. As long as these
two are identical, the electronic structures and the magnetic exchange
interactions bear close resemblances. Consequently, the materials exhibit
identical electronic properties, by and large. We analysed the roles of
different transition metal atoms in affecting hybridisations and correlated
them with the above observations. This work, therefore, provides important
perspectives regarding the underlying physics of half-metallic behaviour in
quaternary Heusler compounds which goes beyond specifics of a given material.
This, thus, paves way for smart prediction of new half-metals. This work also
figures out an open problem of understanding how different ternary Heuslers
with different electronic behaviour may lead to half-metallic behaviour in
quaternary Heuslers with 4$d$ transition metal elements.

in Dirac materials. We show that this point of view needs to be refined in the
semiclassical picture which applies to the case of doped Dirac materials (away
from the nodal point in the spectrum). We derive a novel type of Boltzmann
equation for these systems if they are brought slightly out-of-equilibrium.
Remarkably, spin-momentum locking is softened and a generalized spin

performing image-level classification. The model is jointly trained for

improvement of segmentation performance compared to the standard supervised

have been derived for single-sided wavefield focusing. Although the required

time-reversal focusing. This approach has therefore the potential to reduce

both prior-knowledge and vision attention in learning new knowledge, we present
a novel paradigm of meta-learning approach with three developments to introduce
attention mechanism and prior-knowledge for meta-learning. In our approach,
prior-knowledge is responsible for helping meta-learner expressing the input
data into high-level representation space, and attention mechanism enables
meta-learner focusing on key features of the data in the representation space.
Compared with existing meta-learning approaches that pay little attention to
prior-knowledge and vision attention, our approach alleviates the
meta-learner's few-shot cognition burden. Furthermore, a Task-Over-Fitting
(TOF) problem, which indicates that the meta-learner has poor generalization on
different K-shot learning tasks, is discovered and we propose a Cross-Entropy
across Tasks (CET) metric to model and solve the TOF problem. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that we improve the meta-learner with state-of-the-art
performance on several few-shot learning benchmarks, and at the same time the
TOF problem can also be released greatly.

existing approaches formulate abnormal event detection as an outlier detection
task, due to the scarcity of anomalous data during training. Because of the
lack of prior information regarding abnormal events, these methods are not
fully-equipped to differentiate between normal and abnormal events. In this
work, we formalize abnormal event detection as a one-versus-rest binary
classification problem. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce an
unsupervised feature learning framework based on object-centric convolutional
auto-encoders to encode both motion and appearance information. Second, we
propose a supervised classification approach based on clustering the training
samples into normality clusters. A one-versus-rest abnormal event classifier is
then employed to separate each normality cluster from the rest. For the purpose
of training the classifier, the other clusters act as dummy anomalies. During
inference, an object is labeled as abnormal if the highest classification score
assigned by the one-versus-rest classifiers is negative. Comprehensive
experiments are performed on four benchmarks: Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD and
UMN. Our approach provides superior results on all four data sets. On the
large-scale ShanghaiTech data set, our method provides an absolute gain of 8.4%

deconvolution, which regresses spectral data into the sum of unimodal basis

framework for considering not only the target physical model but also the
measurement model as a probabilistic model, and enables us to estimate the
parameter of a physical model with its confidence interval through a Bayesian
posterior distribution given a measurement data set. The measurement with
Poisson noise is one of the most effective system to apply our proposed method.
Since the measurement time is strongly related to the signal-to-noise ratio for
the Poisson noise model, Bayesian measurement with Poisson noise model enables
us to clarify the relationship between the measurement time and the limit of
estimation. In this study, we establish the probabilistic model with Poisson
noise for spectral deconvolution. Bayesian measurement enables us to perform
virtual and computer simulation for a certain measurement through the
established probabilistic model. This property is called ""Virtual Measurement

embeddings that encode hierarchical and entailment information. This makes it
particularly suited to modelling the complex asymmetrical relationships between
Chinese characters and words. In this paper we first train a large scale
hyperboloid skip-gram model on a Chinese corpus, then apply the character
embeddings to a downstream hyperbolic Transformer model derived from the
principles of gyrovector space for Poincare disk model. In our experiments the
character-based Transformer outperformed its word-based Euclidean equivalent.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in Chinese NLP that a
character-based model outperformed its word-based counterpart, allowing the
circumvention of the challenging and domain-dependent task of Chinese Word

we focus on applications where surface transparency is desirable and propose
metasurfaces with embedded plasmonically enhanced light absorption heating,

achieved with rationally nano-engineered coatings consisting of gold

broadband absorbed solar energy into a small volume. This causes a > 10 {\deg}C

ice is most likely to form, delaying freezing, reducing ice adhesion, when it
occurs, to negligible levels (de-icing) and inhibiting frost formation

technology. Previous studies mostly investigated freezing of individual
droplets. The interaction among multiple droplets during freezing is
investigated less, especially on nanotextured icephobic surfaces, despite its
practical importance as water droplets never appear in isolation, but in
groups. Here we show that freezing of a supercooled droplet leads to
spontaneous self-heating and induces strong vaporization. The resulting,
rapidly propagating vapor front causes immediate cascading freezing of
neighboring supercooled droplets upon reaching them. We put forth the
explanation that, as the vapor approaches cold neighboring droplets, it can
lead to local supersaturation and formation of airborne microscopic ice
crystals, which act as freezing nucleation sites. The sequential triggering and
propagation of this mechanism results in the rapid freezing of an entire
droplet ensemble resulting in ice coverage of the nanotextured surface.
Although cascade freezing is observed in a low-pressure environment, it
introduces an unexpected pathway of freezing propagation that can be crucial
for the performance of rationally designed icephobic surfaces.

omnipresent in electrolysis and other gas-producing chemical processes. To
better understand their role in the mass transfer efficiency, we perform
experiments involving successive bubble nucleations from a predefined
nucleation site which consists of a superhydrophobic pit on top of a
micromachined pillar. The experiments on bubble nucleation at these spots
permit the comparison of mass transfer phenomena connected to electrolytically
generated H$_2$ bubbles with the better-understood evolution of CO$_2$ bubbles
in pressure-controlled supersaturated solutions. In both cases, bubbles grow in
a diffusion-dominated regime. For CO$_2$ bubbles, it is found that the growth
rate coefficient of subsequent bubbles always decreases due to the effect of
gas depletion. In contrast, during constant current electrolysis, the bubble
growth rates are affected by the evolution of a boundary layer of dissolved
H$_2$ gas near the flat electrode which competes with gas depletion. This
competition results in three distinct regimes. Initially, the bubble growth
slows down with each new bubble in the succession due to the dominant depletion
of the newly-formed concentration boundary layer. In later stages, the growth
rate increases due to a local increase of gas supersaturation caused by the
continuous gas production and finally levels off to an approximate steady
growth rate. The gas transport efficiency associated with the electrolytic
bubble succession follows a similar trend in time. Finally, for both H$_2$ and
CO$_2$ bubbles, detachment mostly occurs at smaller radii than theory predicts
and at a surprisingly wide spread of sizes. A number of explanations are
proposed, but the ultimate origin of the spreading of the results remains
elusive.

proliferated on social and digital media platforms to fuel recommendations.
These simple surveys and their extrapolation with machine learning algorithms
shed light on user preferences over large and growing pools of items, such as
movies, songs and ads. Social scientists have a long history of measuring
perceptions, preferences and opinions, often over smaller, discrete item sets
with exhaustive rating or ranking surveys. This paper introduces simple surveys
for social science application. We ran experiments to compare the predictive
accuracy of both individual and aggregate comparative assessments using four
types of simple surveys: pairwise comparisons and ratings on 2, 5 and
continuous point scales in three distinct contexts: perceived Safety of Google
Streetview Images, Likeability of Artwork, and Hilarity of Animal GIFs. Across
contexts, we find that continuous scale ratings best predict individual
assessments but consume the most time and cognitive effort. Binary choice
surveys are quick and perform best to predict aggregate assessments, useful for
collective decision tasks, but poorly predict personalized preferences, for
which they are currently used by Netflix to recommend movies. Pairwise
comparisons, by contrast, perform well to predict personal assessments, but
poorly predict aggregate assessments despite being widely used to crowdsource
ideas and collective preferences. We demonstrate how findings from these
surveys can be visualized in a low-dimensional space that reveals distinct
respondent interpretations of questions asked in each context. We conclude by
reflecting on differences between sparse, incomplete simple surveys and their
traditional survey counterparts in terms of efficiency, information elicited
and settings in which knowing less about more may be critical for social
science.
