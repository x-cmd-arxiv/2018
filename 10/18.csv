three-dimensional supernova (SN) simulations performed for a 15 solar-mass
progenitor with the Prometheus-Vertex code using energy-dependent, three-flavor
neutrino transport. The progenitor adopted from stellar evolution calculations
including magnetic fields had a fairly low specific angular momentum (j_Fe <~
10^{15} cm^2/s) in the iron core (central angular velocity ~0.2 rad/s), which
we compared to simulations without rotation and with artificially enhanced
rotation (j_Fe <~ 2*10^{16} cm^2/s; central angular velocity ~0.5 rad/s). Our
results confirm that the time-domain GW signals of SNe are stochastic, but
possess deterministic components with characteristic patterns at low
frequencies (<~200 Hz), caused by mass motions due to the standing accretion
shock instability (SASI), and at high frequencies, associated with gravity-mode
oscillations in the surface layer of the proto-neutron star (PNS). Non-radial
mass motions in the post-shock layer as well as PNS convection are important
triggers of GW emission, whose amplitude scales with the power of the
hydrodynamic flows. There is no monotonic increase of the GW amplitude with
rotation, but a clear correlation with the strength of SASI activity. Our
slowly rotating model is a fainter GW emitter than the non-rotating model
because of weaker SASI activity and damped convection in the post-shock layer
and PNS. In contrast, the faster rotating model exhibits a powerful SASI spiral
mode during its transition to explosion, producing the highest GW amplitudes
with a distinctive drift of the low-frequency emission peak from ~80-100 Hz to
~40-50 Hz. This migration signifies shock expansion, whereas non-exploding
models are discriminated by the opposite trend.

of quantum dynamics in lattice systems, a striking interference phenomenon
known as Aharonov-Bohm caging. At the level of the single-particle energy
spectrum, this full-localization effect is attributed to the collapse of Bloch
bands into a set of perfectly flat (dispersionless) bands. In such lattice
models, the effects of inter-particle interactions generally lead to a breaking
of the cages, and hence, to the spreading of the wavefunction over the lattice.
Motivated by recent experimental realizations of analog Aharonov-Bohm cages for
light, using coupled-waveguide arrays, we hereby demonstrate that caging always
occurs in the presence of local nonlinearities. As a central result, we focus
on special caged solutions, which are accompanied by a breathing motion of the
field intensity, that we describe in terms of an effective two-mode model
reminiscent of a bosonic Josephson junction. Moreover, we explore the quantum
regime using small particle ensembles, and we observe quasi-caged
collapse-revival dynamics with negligible leakage. The results stemming from
this work open an interesting route towards the characterization of nonlinear
dynamics in interacting flat band systems.

telescope with a 1.7 m-diameter primary mirror currently under development. The
WSO-UV is aimed to operate in the 115-310 nm UV spectral range. Its two major
science instruments are UV spectrographs and a UV imaging field camera with
filter wheels. The WSO-UV project is currently in the implementation phase,
with a tentative launch date in 2023. Recently, two additional instruments
devoted to exoplanets have been proposed for WSO-UV, which are the focus of
this paper. UVSPEX, a UV-Spectrograph for Exoplanets, aims to determine atomic
hydrogen and oxygen abundance in the exospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. The
spectral range is 115-130 nm which enables simultaneous measurement of hydrogen
and oxygen emission intensities during an exoplanet transit. Study of exosphere
transit photometric curves can help differentiate among different types of
rocky planets. The exospheric temperature of an Earth-like planet is much
higher than that of a Venus-like planet, because of the low mixing ratio of the
dominant coolant (CO2) in the upper atmosphere of the former, which causes a
large difference in transit depth at the oxygen emission line. Thus, whether
the terrestrial exoplanet is Earth-like, Venus-like, or other can be
determined. SCEDI, a Stellar Coronagraph for Exoplanet Direct Imaging is aimed
to directly detect the starlight reflected from exoplanets orbiting their
parent stars or from the stellar vicinity including circumstellar discs, dust,
and clumps. SCEDI will create an achromatic (optimized to 420-700 nm wavelength
range), high-contrast stellocentric coronagraphic image of a circumstellar
vicinity. The two instruments: UVSPEX and SCEDI, share common power and control
modules. The present communication outlines the science goals of both proposed
instruments and explains some of their engineering features.

assumption that all quartic couplings' beta functions vanish simultaneously at

accidentally, because the Higgs boson mass is close to 125 GeV. This also ties
closely into the question of whether the theory is stable or metastable. We
investigate if such ""fixed points"" can exist in various
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM subclasses, and if the theories that meet these
conditions are phenomenologically viable, as well as vacuum stable. We find
that the fixed point condition drastically reduces the parameter space of 2HDM
theories, but can be met. Fixed points can only exist in type II and type Y
models, in regions of large tan$\beta$, and they are only compatible with all
existing experimental bounds if the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry is at least softly
broken, with a soft breaking parameter of at least $M_{12}$ $>$ 70 GeV (380
GeV) for type Y (type II) models. The allowed region falls into the alignment
limit, with the mixing angle combination $|\alpha - \beta|
\approx\frac{\pi}{2}$. While there are both vacuum-stable and vacuum-unstable
solutions, only the vacuum-unstable ones really agree with Standard-Model-like
CP-even Higgs boson mass values of 125 GeV. The vacuum-stable solutions favour
slightly higher values. While scenarios of asymptotically safe 2HDM exist, they
cannot improve over the Standard Model regarding the question of vacuum

  Game-Theoretic Approach","13 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The introduction of advanced communication infrastructure into the power grid
raises a plethora of new opportunities to tackle climate change. This paper is
concerned with the security of energy management systems which are expected to
be implemented in the future smart grid. The existence of a novel class of
false data injection attacks that are based on modifying forecasted demand data
is demonstrated, and the impact of the attacks on a typical system's parameters
is identified, using a simulated scenario. Monitoring strategies that the
utility company may employ in order to detect the attacks are proposed and a
game--theoretic approach is used to support the utility company's
decision--making process for the allocation of their defence resources.
Informed by these findings, a generic security game is devised and solved,
revealing the existence of several Nash Equilibrium strategies. The practical
outcomes of these results for the utility company are discussed in detail and a
proposal is made, suggesting how the generic model may be applied to other
scenarios.

energy-momentum tensor and Konishi operators to produce singlet states in the
scattering processes to probe the soft and the collinear properties of the
cross sections. By appropriately defining the infrared safe observables, we
obtain collinear splitting functions up to second order in the perturbation
theory. The splitting functions and the infrared finite cross sections
demonstrate several interesting connections with those in the perturbative QCD.
We also determine the process independent soft distribution function up to
third order in the perturbation theory and show that it is universal {\it i.e.}
independent of the operators as well as the external states. Interestingly, the
soft distribution function in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory matches exactly with the
leading transcendental part of the corresponding one in the QCD. This enables
us to predict the third order soft plus virtual cross section for the
production of the on-shell singlet states.

a modeling approach should be used, where the obtained clusters are homogeneous

$f(R,\mathcal{T})=R+2\chi\mathcal{T}$, where $R$ is Ricci scalar, $\mathcal{T}$
is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of matter, and $\chi$ is a coupling
constant. To obtain our solution to the modified Einstein equations, we
successfully apply the `embedding class 1' techniques. We also consider the
case when the strange quark matter (SQM) distribution is governed by the
simplified MIT bag model equation of state given by
$p_r=\frac{1}{3}\left(\rho-4B\right)$, where $B$ is bag constant. We calculate
the radius of the strange star candidates by directly solving the modified TOV
equation with the observed values of the mass and some parametric values of $B$
and $\chi$. The physical acceptability of our solutions is verified by
performing several physical tests. Interestingly, besides the SQM, another type
of matter distribution originates due to the effect of coupling between the
matter and curvature terms in the $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ gravity theory.
Our study shows that with decreasing the value of $\chi$, the stellar systems
under investigations become gradually massive and larger in size, turning them
into less dense compact objects. It also reveals that for $\chi<0$ the
$f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ gravity emerges as a suitable theory for
explaining the observed massive stellar objects like massive pulsars,
super-Chandrasekhar stars and magnetars, etc., which remain obscure in the
standard framework of General Relativity (GR).

major fields, one based on quantum mechanics and the other on molecular

quantum mechanical methods have been typically relegated to the study of small
systems. Classical force field methods can describe systems with millions of
atoms, but suffer from well known problems. For example, these methods have
problems describing the rich coordination chemistry of transition metals or
physical phenomena such as charge transfer. The requirement of specific
parametrization also limits their applicability. There is clearly a need to
develop new computational methods based on quantum mechanics to study large and
heterogeneous systems. Quantum based methods are typically limited by the
calculation of two-electron integrals and diagonalization of large matrices.
Our initial work focused on the development of fast techniques for the
calculation of two-electron integrals. In this publication the diagonalization
problem is addressed and results from molecular dynamics simulations of alanine
decamer in gas-phase using a new fast pseudo-diagonalization method are

$C_3$ symmetry, as realizable in Bernal-stacked honeycomb bilayers. Within a
renormalization-group analysis, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum
critical point at a finite value of the density-density interactions,
separating a semimetallic disordered phase at weak coupling from a gapped
ordered phase at strong coupling. The latter may be characterized by, for
instance, antiferromagnetic, quantum anomalous Hall, or charge density wave
order. In the semimetallic phase, each point of quadratic band touching splits
into four Dirac cones as a consequence of the nontrivial interaction-induced
self-energy correction, which we compute to the two-loop order. We show that
the quantum critical point is in the $(2+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu
universality class characterized by emergent Lorentz invariance and a dynamic
critical exponent $z=1$. At finite temperatures, $T > 0$, we hence conjecture a
crossover between $z=2$ at intermediate $T$ and $z=1$ at low $T$, and we
construct the resulting nontrivial phase diagram as function of coupling
strength and temperature.

and mass of dark matter haloes hosting present-day $\sim L^\star$ central
galaxies in the EAGLE simulations. The scatter is uncorrelated with the
accretion rate of the central galaxy's black hole (BH), but correlates strongly
and negatively with the BH's mass, implicating differences in the expulsion of
gas by active galactic nucleus feedback, throughout the assembly of the halo,
as the main cause of scatter. Haloes whose central galaxies host undermassive
BHs also tend to retain a higher gas fraction, and exhibit elevated star
formation rates (SFRs). Diversity in the mass of central BHs stems primarily
from diversity in the dark matter halo binding energy, as these quantities are
strongly and positively correlated at fixed halo mass, such that $\sim L^\star$
galaxies hosted by haloes that are more (less) tightly-bound develop central
BHs that are more (less) massive than is typical for their halo mass.
Variations in the halo gas fraction at fixed halo mass are reflected in both
the soft X-ray luminosity and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, suggesting that
the prediction of a strong coupling between the properties of galaxies and
their halo gas fractions can be tested with measurements of these diagnostics
for galaxies with diverse SFRs but similar halo masses.

work, we apply the recently updated primordial binary distribution model
(Belloni et al. 2017; implemented here in a new version of MCLUSTER) and
perform a large set of direct N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility
of this dynamical scenario. Our results suggest that if 3-4 OB stars in the ONC
formed primordially mass-segregated in the cluster centre with a maximum
separation of about 0.003 pc, all OB stars have a high chance (50-70 per cent)
to escape from the centre and do not come back within 1 Myr and the dynamical
ejection scenario is a viable channel to form short-age-interval
multipopulation sequences as observed in the ONC. This is also consistent with
self-regulated star formation.

obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) and 21cm-data from the HALOGAS project and the Green Bank
Telescope (GBT). We detect strong HI Ly alpha absorption in the velocity range
+550 to +800 km s^-1 related to gas from a NGC4631 tidal stream known as Spur
2. We measure a column density of log N(HI)=18.68pm0.15, indicating that the
quasar sightline traces the outer boundary of Spur 2 as seen in the 21cm data.
Metal absorption in Spur 2 is detected in the lines of OI, CII, SiII, and SiIII
in a complex absorption pattern that reflects the multi-phase nature of the
gas. We find that the average neutral gas fraction in Spur 2 towards
2MASSJ12421031+3214268 is only 14 percent. This implies that ionized gas
dominates the total mass of Spur 2, which then may comprise more than 10^9
M_sun. No significant depletion of Si is observed, showing that Spur 2 does not
contain significant amounts of dust. From the measured OI/HI column-density
ratio we determine an alpha abundance in Spur 2 of 0.13pm0.07 solar
([alpha/H]=-0.90pm 0.16), which is substantially lower than what is observed in
the NGC4631 disk. The low metallicity and low dust content suggest that Spur 2

feedback in Eris2k, due to the collective effect of the different micro-physics
implementations, results in a galaxy which is less massive than its ErisBH
counterpart till z~1. However, when the stellar content is large enough so that
global dynamical instabilities can be triggered, the galaxy in Eris2k develops
a stronger and more extended bar with respect to ErisBH. We demonstrate that he
structural properties and time evolution of the two bars are very different.
Our results highlight the importance of accurate sub-grid prescriptions in
cosmological zoom-in simulations of the process of galaxy formation and
evolution, and the possible use of a statistical sample of barred galaxies to
assess the strength of the stellar feedback.

population of the Galaxy. Metallicity controls the opacity of stellar
atmospheres; in metal poor stars, hydrostatic equilibrium is reached at a
smaller radius, leading to smaller radii for a given effective temperature. We
compile a sample of 88 stars that span spectral classes K7 to M6 and include
stars with metallicity classes from solar-metallicity dwarf stars to the lowest
metallicity ultra-subdwarfs to test how metallicity changes the stellar radius.
We fit models to Palomar Double Spectrograph (DBSP) optical spectra to derive
effective temperatures ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and we measure bolometric
luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bol}$) by combining broad wavelength-coverage
photometry with Gaia parallaxes. Radii are then computed by combining the
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ and $L_\mathrm{bol}$ using the Stefan-Boltzman law. We find
that for a given temperature, ultra-subdwarfs can be as much as five times
smaller than their solar-metallicity counterparts. We present color-radius and
color-surface brightness relations that extend down to [Fe/H] of $-$2.0 dex, in
order to aid the radius determination of M subdwarfs, which will be especially
important for the WFIRST exoplanetary microlensing survey.

used for inflation, and it allows us to express the quasinormal mode spectrum
in terms of a small number of parameters. This work is a first step in
describing, in a model independent way, how the scalar hair can affect the
ringdown stage and leave signatures on the emitted gravitational wave signal.
Potential signatures include the shifting of the quasi-normal spectrum, the
breaking of isospectrality between polar and axial modes, and the existence of

Fourier transform, and energy loss rate of a triple system through three
different channels of radiation, the scalar, vector and tensor modes, in
Einstein-aether theory of gravity. In the weak-field approximations and with
the recently obtained constraints of the theory, we first analyze the energy
loss rate of a binary system, and find that the dipole contributions from the
scalar and vector modes could be of the order of
${\cal{O}}\left(c_{14}\right){\cal{O}}\left(G_Nm/d\right)^2$, where $c_{14} \;

{\cal{O}}\left(10^{-5}\right)$ by current observations, where $c_i$'s are the
four coupling constants of the theory. On the other hand, the ""strong-field""
effects for a binary system of neutron stars are about six orders lower than
that of GR. So, in this paper we ignore these ""strong-field"" effects and first
develop the general formulas to the lowest post-Newtonian order, by taking the
coupling of the aether field with matter into account. Within this
approximation, we find that the scalar breather mode and the scalar
longitudinal mode are all suppressed by a factor of
${\cal{O}}\left(c_{14}\right)$ with respect to the transverse-traceless modes
($h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$), while the vectorial modes $(h_{X}$ and $h_{Y}$) are
suppressed by a factor of $c_{13} \lesssim {\cal{O}}\left(10^{-15}\right)$.
Applying the general formulas to a triple system with periodic orbits, we find
that the corresponding GW form, response function, and its Fourier transform
depend sensitively on both the configuration of the triple system and their
orientations with respect to the detectors.

of the CO abundance. We find the CO abundance varies by an order of magnitude
or more across each region, averaging a few$\times$10$^{-5}$ CO per H$_2$, and
that the CO abundance distribution across each clump is correlated in both form
and magnitude with environmental conditions, especially $T_{\text{d}}$. This
demonstrates that no single CO abundance suffices to convert from
$N_{\text{CO}}$ to \ncol, even within a single molecular cloud. We also find
that $L/M$ traces $T_{\text{d}}$ almost exclusively, and therefore is not an
independent star formation tracer, but minima in $T_{\text{d}}$ almost
universally coincide with maxima in \ncol, implying that cooling and density
enhancement must be simultaneous steps in prestellar clump evolution. Finally,

corrected $R^2$ Starobinsky inflation model, in the presence of a Kalb-Ramond
field in the gravitational action of $F(R)$ gravity. Our main interest is to
pin down the effect of this rank two antisymmetric tensor field on the
inflationary phenomenology of the $F(R)$ gravity theory at hand. The effects of
the Kalb-Ramond field are expected to be strong during the inflationary era,
however as the Universe expands, the energy density of the Kalb-Ramond field
scales as $\sim a^{-6}$ so dark matter and radiation dominate over the
Kalb-Ramond field effects. In general, antisymmetric fields constitute the
field content of superstring theories, and thus their effect at the low-energy
limit of the theory is expected to be significant. As we will show, for a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, the Kalb-Ramond field actually reduces to a
scalar field, so it is feasible to calculate the observational indices of
inflation. We shall calculate the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio
for the model at hand, by assuming two conditions for the resulting Kalb-Ramond
scalar field, the slow-roll and the constant-roll condition. As we shall
demonstrate, in both the slow-roll and constant-roll cases, compatibility with
the latest observational data can be achieved. Also the effect of the
Kalb-Ramond field on the inflationary phenomenology is to increase the amount
of the predicted primordial gravitational radiation, in comparison to the
corresponding $f(R)$ gravities, however the results are still compatible with
the observational data.

them from conventional umbral flashes. Observed local temperature enhancements

and a dispersion equation has been obtained. The Muller's method and
Newton--Raphson method were used to obtain illustrative numerical results of
the dispersion equation. The solutions were found to converge as the number of
Floquet harmonics increased. This formulation does not require the computation
of the photonic bandgaps and directly computes the surface-wave modes. This
formulation could engender new applications of plasmonics exploiting the
neglected interface along the direction of periodicity of the one dimensional
photonic crystals.

  Robot Interaction (HRI) Setting","Accepted in ICRA'19, https://msiam.github.io/ivos/",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Video object segmentation is an essential task in robot manipulation to
facilitate grasping and learning affordances. Incremental learning is important
for robotics in unstructured environments, since the total number of objects
and their variations can be intractable. Inspired by the children learning
process, human robot interaction (HRI) can be utilized to teach robots about
the world guided by humans similar to how children learn from a parent or a
teacher. A human teacher can show potential objects of interest to the robot,
which is able to self adapt to the teaching signal without providing manual
segmentation labels. We propose a novel teacher-student learning paradigm to
teach robots about their surrounding environment. A two-stream motion and
appearance ""teacher"" network provides pseudo-labels to adapt an appearance
""student"" network. The student network is able to segment the newly learned
objects in other scenes, whether they are static or in motion. We also
introduce a carefully designed dataset that serves the proposed HRI setup,
denoted as (I)nteractive (V)ideo (O)bject (S)egmentation. Our IVOS dataset
contains teaching videos of different objects, and manipulation tasks. Unlike
previous datasets, IVOS provides manipulation tasks sequences with segmentation
annotation along with the waypoints for the robot trajectories. It also
provides segmentation annotation for the different transformations such as
translation, scale, planar rotation, and out-of-plane rotation. Our proposed
adaptation method outperforms the state-of-the-art on DAVIS and FBMS with 6.8%
and 1.2% in F-measure respectively. It improves over the baseline on IVOS

electron EDM, $|d_e| < 1.1 \times 10^{-29}\, e\, {\rm cm}$, from measurements
of the ThO molecule. This is a powerful constraint on CP-violating new physics:
even new physics generating the EDM at two loops is constrained at the
multi-TeV scale. We interpret the bound in the context of different scenarios
for new physics: a general order-of-magnitude analysis for both the electron
EDM and the CP-odd electron-nucleon coupling; 1-loop SUSY, probing sleptons
above 10 TeV; 2-loop SUSY, probing multi-TeV charginos or stops; and finally,
new physics that generates the EDM via the charm quark or top quark Yukawa
couplings. In the last scenario, new physics generates a ""QULE operator"" $(q_f
\bar{\sigma}^{\mu \nu}{\bar u}_f) \cdot (\ell {\bar{\sigma}}_{\mu \nu} {\bar
e})$, which in turn generates the EDM through RG evolution. If the QULE
operator is generated at tree level, this corresponds to a previously studied
leptoquark model. For the first time, we also classify scenarios in which the
QULE operator is generated at one loop through a box diagram, which include
SUSY and leptoquark models. The electron EDM bound is the leading constraint on
a wide variety of theories of CP-violating new physics interacting with the
Higgs boson or the top quark. We argue that any future nonzero measurement of
an electron EDM will provide a strong motivation for constructing new colliders

Gd2Zr2O7 ceramics with a series of grain sizes (55-221 nm) were synthesized and
irradiated by 190 keV He ion beam up to a fluence of 5x10^17 ions/cm2. Both the
degree of post irradiation cell volume expansion and the amorphization fraction
appear to be size dependent. As the average grain size evolves from 55 to 221

1.02 %, and the amorphization fraction increases from 6.8 to 11.1 %.
Additionally, the threshold He concentrations (at. %) of bubbles at different

bubble-chains and (3) ribbon-like bubbles within the grain, are all found to be
much higher in the nanograin ceramic (55 nm) compared with that of the

time-consuming, where large amounts of training samples and iterative

paper, we focus on the time-consuming training process of large-scale CNNs and
propose a Bi-layered Parallel Training (BPT-CNN) architecture in distributed
computing environments. BPT-CNN consists of two main components: (a) an
outer-layer parallel training for multiple CNN subnetworks on separate data
subsets, and (b) an inner-layer parallel training for each subnetwork. In the
outer-layer parallelism, we address critical issues of distributed and parallel
computing, including data communication, synchronization, and workload balance.
A heterogeneous-aware Incremental Data Partitioning and Allocation (IDPA)
strategy is proposed, where large-scale training datasets are partitioned and
allocated to the computing nodes in batches according to their computing power.
To minimize the synchronization waiting during the global weight update
process, an Asynchronous Global Weight Update (AGWU) strategy is proposed. In
the inner-layer parallelism, we further accelerate the training process for
each CNN subnetwork on each computer, where computation steps of convolutional
layer and the local weight training are parallelized based on task-parallelism.
We introduce task decomposition and scheduling strategies with the objectives
of thread-level load balancing and minimum waiting time for critical paths.
Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed BPT-CNN effectively
improves the training performance of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.

dependence of the emission rate on the instantaneous electric field strength,
the CEP-sensitive component of the emitted photocurrent is highly sensitive to
the energy of the optical pulse, and should carry information about the
underlying sub-cycle dynamics of electron emission. Here we examine
CEP-sensitive photoemission from plasmonic gold nanoantennas excited with
few-cycle optical pulses of increasing energy. We observe antiresonance-like
features in the CEP-sensitive photocurrent; specifically, at a critical pulse
energy, we observe a sharp dip in the magnitude of the CEP-sensitive
photocurrent accompanied by a sudden shift of {\pi}-radians in the phase of the
photocurrent. Using a quasi-static tunneling emission model, we find that these
antiresonance-like features arise due to competition between electron emission
from neighboring optical half-cycles, and that they are highly sensitive to the
precise shape of the driving optical waveform at the surface of the emitter. As
the underlying mechanisms that produce the antiresonance-like features are a
general consequence of nonlinear, field-driven photoemission, the
antiresonance-like features could be used to probe sub-optical-cycle,
sub-femtosecond emission processes, not only from solid-state emitters, but
also from gas-phase atoms and molecules. Beyond applications in the study of
ultrafast, field-driven electron physics, an understanding of these

jets. The jet base flow is assumed to be parallel and of a vortex-sheet type.
The eigenfunctions of this simplified stability problem are expanded using the
eigenfunctions of a round jet. The original problem is then formulated as an
innovative matrix eigenvalue problem, which can be solved in a very robust and
efficient manner. The results show that the lobed geometry changes both the
convection velocity and temporal growth rate of the instability waves. However,
different modes are affected differently. In particular, mode 0 is not
sensitive to the geometry changes, while modes of higher-orders can be changed
significantly. The changes become more pronounced as the number of lobes N and
the penetration ratio $\epsilon$ increase. Moreover, the lobed geometry can
cause a previously degenerate eigenvalue ($\lambda_n = \lambda_{-n}$) to become
non-degenerate ($\lambda_n \ne \lambda_{-n}$) and lead to opposite changes to
the stability characteristics of the corresponding symmetric (n) and
antisymmetric (-n) modes. It is also shown that each eigen-mode changes its
shape in response to the lobes of the vortex sheet, and the degeneracy of an
eigenvalue occurs when the vortex sheet has more symmetric planes than the
corresponding mode shape (including both symmetric and antisymmetric planes).
The new approach developed in this paper can be used to study the stability
characteristics of jets of other arbitrary geometries in a robust and efficient
manner.

from segregation of CO$_2$ from a CO$_2$:H$_2$O mixture during thermal
processing. Previous laboratory studies quantified the temperature dependence
of segregation, but no systematic measurement of the concentration dependence
of segregation is available. In this study, we measured both the temperature
dependence and concentration dependence of CO$_2$ segregation in CO$_2$:H$_2$O

the broad component of the asymmetric stretching vibrational mode of

realization of a Kondo lattice has generated a tremendous effort of the
community, from both standpoints of experiments and theory. The pursuit of
obtaining independent magnetic moments, via charge localization through Coulomb
interactions, is paramount for applications in nanotechnology. In particular,
systems with simultaneous charge and spin degrees of freedom can manifest both
Kondo spin quenching and Mott-Hubbard charge localization. A unified
experimental framework illuminating the pathway between the two phenomena is of
physical and technological interest, and is (as of yet) hardly observed in real
condensed matter systems. Recent developments in the ability to control
densities and temperatures of strongly correlated Fermionic impurities on
surfaces and substrates has opened up a new paradigm of possibilities for this
pathway. In particular, a milestone was recently surpassed through the
observation of self-assembled superlattices of f band adatoms on metallic
surfaces, such as the deposition of Ce on Ag(111). Such lattices have
introduced a mechanism of diluted correlated lattices where the interaction
between Kondo and Mott physics can be methodically studied. However, it remains
difficult to control the adatom distances and substrate densities in these
systems, and the interplay between Kondo physics and charge localization
remains elusive. In this work, we systematically investigate the phase diagram
of superlattice structures of heavy f elements deposited on metallic
substrates, and assess the required conditions to obtain Kondo lattices in
superlattices. We unveil a unique pathway between Kondo quenching and Mott
localization, and identify a non-trivial charge density wave phase emerging

DDTRS using the Apache Spark cloud platform. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed DDTRS realizes disease-symptom clustering

attractive platform for high speed as well as long range OFDI. Unfortunately,
aliasing artifacts arising from signals beyond the principle measurement depth
of the free spectral range have prohibited the use of a FC FDML for imaging so
far. To make the enhanced coherence length of FC FDML laser available, methods
to manage such artifacts are required. Recently, coherent circular ranging has
been demonstrated that uses frequency combs for imaging in much reduced RF

The performance of the Dynamic Watermarking detector is compared to three
classical anomaly detectors in simulation and on a real-world platform. These
experiments illustrate that the attack capability under the Dynamic
Watermarking detector is comparable to those of classic anomaly detectors.
Importantly, these experiments also make clear that the Dynamic Watermarking

  Computing Environments",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the era of big data, practical applications in various domains continually
generate large-scale time-series data. Among them, some data show significant
or potential periodicity characteristics, such as meteorological and financial
data. It is critical to efficiently identify the potential periodic patterns
from massive time-series data and provide accurate predictions. In this paper,
a Periodicity-based Parallel Time Series Prediction (PPTSP) algorithm for
large-scale time-series data is proposed and implemented in the Apache Spark
cloud computing environment. To effectively handle the massive historical
datasets, a Time Series Data Compression and Abstraction (TSDCA) algorithm is
presented, which can reduce the data scale as well as accurately extracting the
characteristics. Based on this, we propose a Multi-layer Time Series Periodic
Pattern Recognition (MTSPPR) algorithm using the Fourier Spectrum Analysis
(FSA) method. In addition, a Periodicity-based Time Series Prediction (PTSP)
algorithm is proposed. Data in the subsequent period are predicted based on all
previous period models, in which a time attenuation factor is introduced to
control the impact of different periods on the prediction results. Moreover, to
improve the performance of the proposed algorithms, we propose a parallel
solution on the Apache Spark platform, using the Streaming real-time computing
module. To efficiently process the large-scale time-series datasets in
distributed computing environments, Distributed Streams (DStreams) and
Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) are used to store and calculate these
datasets. Extensive experimental results show that our PPTSP algorithm has
significant advantages compared with other algorithms in terms of prediction
accuracy and performance.

that the Milky Way stellar halo is dominated by metal-rich stars on highly
eccentric orbits. To shed light on the nature of this prominent halo component,
we have analysed 28 Galaxy analogues in the Auriga suite of cosmological
hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations. Some three quarters of the Auriga galaxies
contain significant components with high radial velocity anisotropy, beta >
0.6. However, only in one third of the hosts do the high-beta stars contribute
significantly to the accreted stellar halo overall, similar to what is observed
in the Milky Way. For this particular subset we reveal the origin of the
dominant stellar halo component with high metallicity, [Fe/H]~-1, and high
orbital anisotropy, beta>0.8, by tracing their stars back to the epoch of
accretion. It appears that, typically, these stars come from a single dwarf
galaxy with a stellar mass of order of 10^9-10^10 Msol that merged around 6-10
Gyr ago, causing a sharp increase in the halo mass. Our study therefore
establishes a firm link between the excess of radially anisotropic stellar
debris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient head-on collision between the young
Milky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy

criteria. In this paper, we assume the server's scheduling disciplines to be
heterogeneous. More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline
which belongs to the class of limited processor sharing (LPS-$d$) scheduling
disciplines. Under LPS-$d$, up to $d$ jobs can be served simultaneously, and
hence, includes as special cases First Come First Served ($d=1$) and Processor
Sharing ($d=\infty$).
  In order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model the above load-balancing
framework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem. Using the relaxation
technique, as first developed in the seminal work of Whittle, we derive
Whittle's index policy for general cost functions and obtain a closed-form
expression for Whittle's index in terms of the steady-state distribution.
Through numerical computations, we investigate the performance of Whittle's
index with two different performance criteria: linear cost criterion and a cost
criterion that depends on the first and second moment of the throughput. Our
results show that \emph{(i)} the structure of Whittle's index policy can
strongly depend on the scheduling discipline implemented in the server, i.e.,
on $d$, and that \emph{(ii)} Whittle's index policy significantly outperforms
standard dispatching rules such as Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), Join the
Shortest Expected Workload (JSEW), and Random Server allocation (RSA).

this term on equal footing with other terms that requires mapping to a
two-scalar field model, and in general leads to different observational

collaborate to evaluate a common target policy. The network approach allows for
efficient exploration of the state space and allows all agents to converge to
the optimal solution even in situations where neither agent can converge on its
own without cooperation. The second scenario is that of multi-agent games, in
which the state is global and rewards are local. In this scenario, agents
collaborate to estimate the value function of a target team policy. The
proposed algorithm combines off-policy learning, eligibility traces and linear

layers in one block share the same weights. A LadderNet has more paths for
information flow because of skip connections and residual blocks, and can be
viewed as an ensemble of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). The equivalence to
an ensemble of FCNs improves segmentation accuracy, while the shared weights
within each residual block reduce parameter number. Semantic segmentation is
essential for retinal disease detection. We tested LadderNet on two benchmark
datasets for blood vessel segmentation in retinal images, and achieved superior
performance over methods in the literature. The implementation is provided

coherent errors and comparing algorithm success rates for different choices of
two-qubit gates that are constructed from composite pulse sequences, where the
residual gate errors are related by a unitary transformation. As a result, all
of the sequences have the same error relative to the ideal gate under any

circuit success can vary dramatically by choosing error orientations that do
not affect the final outcome and error orientations that cancel between
conjugate controlled-nots, as demonstrated here with Clifford circuits,
compiled Toffoli gates, and quantum simulation algorithms. The results point to
the utility of both minimizing the error and optimizing the error direction and
also to the advantages of using multiple control sequences for the same gate

spin models, such as the Ising-Heisenberg spin models, among others. Here we
report a relationship between the zero-temperature phase boundary residual
entropy (critical residual entropy) and pseudo-transition. Usually, the
residual entropy increases in the phase boundary, which means the system
becomes more degenerate at the phase boundary compared to its adjacent states.
However, this is not always the case; at zero temperature, there are some phase
boundaries where the entropy holds the largest residual entropy of the adjacent
states. Therefore, we can propose the following conjecture: If residual entropy
at zero-temperature is a continuous function at least from the one-sided limit
at a critical point, then pseudo-transition evidence will appear at finite
temperature near the critical point. We expect that this argument would apply
to study more realistic models. Only by analyzing the residual entropy at zero
temperature, one could identify a priori whether the system will exhibit the
pseudo-transition at finite temperature. To strengthen our conjecture, we use
two examples of Ising-Heisenberg models, which exhibit pseudo-transition
behavior: one frustrated coupled tetrahedral chain and another unfrustrated
diamond chain.

the sensitivity study of the detailed structure of plasma liners and their

computed using simulation data and compared with the available experimental
data. Simulations predicted that the primary oblique shock wave structure is
preserved at small experimental variations. At later phases of the liner
implosion, primary shocks and, especially, secondary shocks are more sensitive
to experimental variations. These conclusions follow from the simulation data

significant changes in the synthetic interferometer data at early time. Our
studies also showed that the global properties of the plasma liners (averaged

the theoretical interpretation of recent experimental data which revealed the

to drivers. Although various in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) have been
studied extensively, no documentation exists objectively measuring the extent
to which interacting with taxi-hailing application during driving impacts
drivers' behavior. To fill this gap, a simulator-based study was conducted to
synthetically compare the effects that different output modalities (visual,
audio, combined visual-audio) and input modalities (baseline, manual, speech)
imposed on the driving performance. The results show that the visual output
introduced more negative effects on driving performance compared to audio
output. In the combined output, visual component dominated the effects imposed
on the longitudinal control and hazard detection; audio component only
exacerbated the negative effects of visual component on the lateral control.
Speech input modality was overall less detrimental to driving performance than
manual input modality, especially reflected in the drivers' quicker reaction to
hazard events. The visual-manual interaction modality most severely impaired
the hazard detecting ability, while also led to strong compensative behaviors.
The audio-speech and visual-speech modality associated with more smooth lateral
control and faster response to hazard events respectively compared to other
modality. These results could be applied to improve the design of not only the
taxi-hailing application, but also other input-output balanced IVIS.

find that extinctions and total column density of the volatile elements (Zn, S)
are correlated (with a best-fit of dust-to-metals (DTM) 4.05x10-22 mag cm2) and
consistent with the LG DTM relation. The refractory elements (Fe, Si) follow a
similar, but less significant, relation offset about 1 dex from the LG

compute the total (gas+dust-phase) column density and find a remarkable
agreement with the LG DTM relation: a best-fit of 4.91x10-22 mag cm2. We then
use our results to compute the amount of 'intervening metal from unknown

the presence of dust and give rise to an average 'cosmic dust dimming' effect

For the nonlinearity coefficient represented by the delta-function, all

positive chemical potentials are found in alternating bands for the cases of
the self-repulsion and attraction, while solutions with negative chemical
potentials exist only in the latter case. These results provide a possibility

Approximating the delta-function by a narrow Gaussian, stability of the
stationary modes is addressed through numerical computation of eigenvalues for
small perturbations, and verified by simulations of the perturbed evolution.
For positive chemical potentials, the stability is investigated in three lowest
bands. In the case of the self-attraction, each band contains a stable subband,
the transition to instability occurring with the increase of the total norm. As
a result, multi-peak states may be stable in higher bands. In the case of the

a Fokker-Planck equation, and to study the statistics of the associated

performing a perturbation expansion with respect to a small dimensionless
parameter $\epsilon =\Omega^{-1}$, where $\Omega$ characterizes the system
size. For example, $\Omega$ could be the mean number of proteins produced by a
gene regulatory network. In the deterministic limit $\Omega\rightarrow \infty$,
the chemical reaction network evolves according to a system of ordinary
differential equations based on classical mass action kinetics. In this paper
we develop a phase reduction method for chemical reaction networks that support
a stable limit cycle in the deterministic limit. We present a variational
principle for the phase reduction, yielding an exact analytic expression for
the resulting phase dynamics. We demonstrate that this decomposition is
accurate over timescales that are exponential in the system size $\Omega$. This
contrasts with the phase equation obtained under the diffusion approximation,
which is only accurate up to times $O(\Omega)$. In particular, we show that for
a constant $C$, the probability that the system leaves an $O(\zeta)$

where $z$ is large, the extra $z$ outliers discarded by the algorithms might be
too large, considering that the data gathering process might be costly. In this
paper, we improve the number of outliers to the best possible $(1+\epsilon)z$,
while maintaining the $O(1)$-approximation ratio and independence of
communication cost on $z$. The problems we consider include the $(k, z)$-center
problem, and $(k, z)$-median/means problems in Euclidean metrics.
Implementation of the our algorithm for $(k, z)$-center shows that it
outperforms many previous algorithms, both in terms of the communication cost
and quality of the output solution.

certain coprimality condition with $a$ and $b$, we construct an explicit finite

in the $NN\rightarrow N\Delta$ process, the vector self-energies of the
outgoing particles are modified relative to the incoming particles in isospin
asymmetric nuclear matter, and it leads to the effective energies of the
incoming $NN$ pair being different from the outgoing $N\Delta$ pair. This
effect is investigated in the calculation of the in-medium $NN\rightarrow

sections of the $\Delta^{++}$ and $\Delta^+$ channels are suppressed, and the
cross sections of the $\Delta^0$ and $\Delta^-$ channels are enhanced relative

make decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of

the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or
actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small.
However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are
usually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the
optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning, a
combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to
overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of deep
reinforcement learning from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we
review deep reinforcement learning approaches proposed to address emerging
issues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network
access, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security,
and connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation
networks such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of deep

magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically
truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and
the largest ones are limited by the system size.
  We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with
potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of
sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to
assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for
power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and
apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is
easy to implement.
  Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the
corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated
log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show
untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double
power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a
truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are

determined. We find that the degeneracy of the ground-state Kramers doublet is
lifted ({\Delta}0 ~7.5 cm-1) due to the Nd3+-Mn3+ interaction in the
ferroelectric phase, below TC ~ 28 K. The Nd3+ magnetic moment mNd(T) and its
contribution to the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are evaluated
from {\Delta}0(T) indicating that the Nd3+ ions are involved in the magnetic
and the ferroelectric ordering observed below ~ 28 K. The Zeeman splitting of
the excited crystal field levels of the Nd3+ ions at low temperature is also
analyzed.

of double spectrum auctions. In this paper, we combine the concept of
differential privacy with double spectrum auction design, and present a
Differentially private Double spectrum auction mechanism with approximate
Social welfare Maximization (DDSM). Specifically, we design the mechanism by
employing the exponential mechanism to select clearing prices for the double
spectrum auction with probabilities exponentially proportional to the related
social welfare values, and then improve the mechanism in several aspects like
the designs of the auction algorithm, the utility function and the buyer
grouping algorithm. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that DDSM achieves
differential privacy, approximate truthfulness, approximate social welfare
maximization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DDSM achieves a good
performance in term of social welfare.

the lens is small and the repeated patterns superpose. Traditionally, matched
filtering techniques are used to identify gravitational-wave signals, but we
instead aim to utilize machine learning techniques to achieve this. In this
work, we implement supervised machine learning classifiers (support vector
machine, random forest, multi-layer perceptron) to discriminate such lensing
patterns in gravitational wave data. We train classifiers with spectrograms of
both lensed and unlensed waves using both point-mass and singular isothermal
sphere lens models. As the result, classifiers return F1 scores ranging from
0.852 to 0.996, with precisions from 0.917 to 0.992 and recalls ranging from
0.796 to 1.000 depending on the type of classifier and lensing model used. This
supports the idea that machine learning classifiers are able to correctly

the position of the piston measured from the thermal wall. Starting from the
exact master equation for the full system and using a perturbation expansion in
$\epsilon= \sqrt{m/M}$, we integrate out the degrees of freedom of the particle
to obtain the effective Fokker-Planck equation for the piston albeit with a
different frictional coefficient. Our microscopic study shows that the piston
is never in equilibrium during the expansion step, contrary to the assumption
made in the usual Szilard engine analysis --- nevertheless the conclusions of
Szilard remain valid.

excess relative to stable nuclei. Their shell structure, which represents
single-particle motion in a nucleus, may vary due to nuclear force and excess
neutrons, in a phenomenon called shell evolution. This effect could be
counterbalanced by collective modes causing deformations of the nuclear
surface. Here, we study the interplay between shell evolution and shape
deformation by focusing on the magnetic moment of an isomeric state of the
neutron-rich nucleus 75Cu. We measure the magnetic moment using highly
spin-controlled rare-isotope beams and achieving large spin alignment via a
two-step reaction scheme that incorporates an angular-momentum-selecting
nucleon removal. By combining our experiments with numerical simulations of
many-fermion correlations, we find that the low-lying states in 75Cu are, to a
large extent, of single-particle nature on top of a correlated 74Ni core. We
elucidate the crucial role of shell evolution even in the presence of the
collective mode, and within the same framework, we consider whether and how the
double magicity of the 78Ni nucleus is restored, which is also of keen interest
from the perspective of nucleosynthesis in explosive stellar processes.

finite sample Hellinger risk for every `approximate' nonparametric maximum
likelihood estimator achieves a near-parametric rate (up to logarithmic
multiplicative factors). In addition, we propose and theoretically study two
`marginal' methods that are more scalable and easily implementable. We

we show that a natural instantiation of the water-filling algorithm is

increasing population demands. One of the many problems they face nowadays is
waste management, which has become a pressing issue requiring new solutions.
Swarm robotics systems have been attracting an increasing amount of attention
in the past years and they are expected to become one of the main driving
factors for innovation in the field of robotics. The research presented in this
paper explores the feasibility of a swarm robotics system in an urban
environment. By using bio-inspired foraging methods such as multi-place
foraging and stigmergy-based navigation, a swarm of robots is able to improve
the efficiency and autonomy of the urban waste management system in a realistic
scenario. To achieve this, a diverse set of simulation experiments was
conducted using real-world GIS data and implementing different garbage
collection scenarios driven by robot swarms. Results presented in this research
show that the proposed system outperforms current approaches. Moreover, results
not only show the efficiency of our solution, but also give insights about how
to design and customize these systems.

challenges in real world `wild tasks' where large difference between labeled

difference is often referred to as `domain gap', and could cause significantly
decreased performance which cannot be easily remedied by further increasing the

such problem without target domain labels. In this paper, we propose a novel
UDA framework based on an iterative self-training procedure, where the problem
is formulated as latent variable loss minimization, and can be solved by
alternatively generating pseudo labels on target data and re-training the model
with these labels. On top of self-training, we also propose a novel
class-balanced self-training framework to avoid the gradual dominance of large
classes on pseudo-label generation, and introduce spatial priors to refine
generated labels. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed methods
achieve state of the art semantic segmentation performance under multiple major

$\phi$, but is a four quark state with $ss\bar s \bar s$ constituents.
Furthermore, there are no two mesons of $s\bar s$ available to form a molecule
which fits the mass spectrum of $\phi(2170)$, thus we suggest it should be an
$ss\bar s \bar s$ tetraquark state. In this scenario, we estimate its decay
rates through the fall-apart mechanism. Our theoretical estimates indicate that
its main decay modes should be $\phi(2170)$ into $\phi f_0(980)$, $ h_1\eta$, $
h_1\eta'$, $K_1(1270)K$ and $K_1(1400)K$. Under this hypothesis the modes
$\phi(2170)\to K^*(890)^0\bar K^*(890)^0$, $K^+K^-$ and $K^0_LK^0_S$ should be
relatively suppressed. Since the width of $h_1$ is rather large, at present it
is hard to gain precise data on $BR(\phi(2170)\to h_1\eta)$ and
$BR(\phi(2170)\to h_1\eta')$ whose measurements may be crucial for drawing a
definite conclusion about the inner assignment of $\phi(2170)$. We lay our

reduced rank regression, which mainly focus on rank selection and prediction

heavy-tailedness of the random noise and statistical bias. For random noise
with bounded $(1+\delta)$th moment with $\delta \in (0,1)$, the rate of
convergence is a function of $\delta$, and is slower than the sub-Gaussian-type
deviation bounds; for random noise with bounded second moment, we obtain a rate
of convergence as if sub-Gaussian noise were assumed. Furthermore, the
transition between the two regimes is smooth. We illustrate the performance of

distinguish configurations belonging to different phases even with the same
total magnetization. For instance, spin spiral and paramagnetic states with
zero total magnetic moment can be easily identified. Being combined with a
simplest neural network our profile approach provides a very accurate phase
classification for three-dimensional magnets characterized by complex
multispiral states even in the critical areas close to phases transitions. By
the example of the skyrmionic configurations we show that profile approach can
be used to separate the states belonging to the same phase.

supporting optical resonant response. We show that significant changes in the
scattering process are governed by the electro-magnetic multipole resonances
which experience spectral red-shift and broadening over the whole visible and
near-infrared spectra as the indices of media increase. Most interestingly that
the considered nanoantenna exhibits the broadband forward scattering in the
visible and near-infrared spectral ranges due to the Kerker-effect in
high-index media. The revealed effect of broadband forward scattering is
essential for highly demanding applications in which the influence of the media

spread in networks is a fundamental problem in many applications such as viral
marketing, online advertising, and disease control. Most existing studies
assume that social influence is static and they fail to capture the dynamics of
influence in reality. In this work, we address the dynamic influence challenge
by designing efficient streaming methods that can identify influential nodes
from highly dynamic node interaction streams. We first propose a general
time-decaying dynamic interaction network (TDN) model to model node interaction
streams with the ability to smoothly discard outdated data. Based on the TDN
model, we design three algorithms, i.e., SieveADN, BasicReduction, and
HistApprox. SieveADN identifies influential nodes from a special kind of TDNs
with efficiency. BasicReduction uses SieveADN as a basic building block to
identify influential nodes from general TDNs. HistApprox significantly improves
the efficiency of BasicReduction. More importantly, we theoretically show that
all three algorithms enjoy constant factor approximation guarantees.
Experiments conducted on various real interaction datasets demonstrate that our

  systems","10 pages,4 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The error performance of the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique
suffers from the inter-user interference (IUI) although it is a promising
technique for the future wireless systems in terms of the achievable sum rate.
Hence, a multiple access technique design with limited IUI and competitive to
NOMA in terms of spectral efficiency is essential. In this letter, we consider
so-called spatial multiple access (SMA) which is based on applying the
principle of spatial modulation (SM) through the different users' data streams,
as a strong alternative to MIMO-NOMA systems. The analytical expressions of bit
error probability (BEP), ergodic sum rate and outage probability are derived
for the SMA. The derivations are validated via computer simulations. In
addition, the comparison of the SMA system with NOMA is presented. The results
reveal that SMA outperforms to the NOMA in terms of the all performance metrics
(i.e., bit error rate (BER), outage probability and ergodic sum rate) besides
it provides low implementation complexity.

between images coming from graphics engine and real world. Such domain
difference deteriorates test time performances of models trained on synthetic

feature adaptation across synthetic and real domain for the special use case of
eye gaze estimation which is an essential component for various downstream HCI
tasks. We initially learn a gaze estimator on annotated synthetic samples
rendered from a 3D game engine and then adapt the features of unannotated real
samples via a zero-sum minmax adversarial game against a domain discriminator
following the recent paradigm of generative adversarial networks. Such
adversarial adaptation forces features of both domains to be indistinguishable
which enables us to use regression models trained on synthetic domain to be
used on real samples. On the challenging MPIIGaze real life dataset, we
outperform recent fully supervised methods trained on manually annotated real
samples by appreciable margins and also achieve 13\% more relative gain after
adaptation compared to the current benchmark method of SimGAN

contemporary astrophysics. Starting with micron-sized dust grains, coagulation
models predict growth up to centimeter (pebbles), but growth beyond this size
is difficult because of fragmentation and drift. Ways to bypass this problem
have focused on inhomogeneities in the flow, be that zonal flows, streaming
instability, or vortices. Because vortices are in equilibrium between the
Coriolis and the pressure force, the pressureless grains will orbit along a
vortex streamline experiencing a drag force. This is a very effective mechanism
to concentrate pebbles as also seen in numerical simulations and possibly in
ALMA observations. Yet, a high pebble load is dangerous for the vortex, and we
showed that in two-dimensional simulations the backreaction eventually leads to
vortex disruption. We investigate whether the same happens in three dimensions.
We perform 3D simulations with pebbles in a local box finding that, although
the pebbles disturb the vortex around the midplane, the column does not get
destroyed. This result is important because, based on the previous 2D result
suggesting complete disruption, the vortex interpretation of ALMA observations
has been called into question. We show instead that the vortex behaves like a
Taylor column, and the pebbles as obstacles to the flow. Pebble accumulation in
the center of the vortices proceeds to roughly the same concentration as in the
control run without backreaction.

show that the BMW algebra is also obeyed, apart from the skein relation, which
is different. This indicates that the BMW algebra is a sub--algebra for all
models with three or more blocks. We find additional relations for the four
block algebra using the expansion of the YBE. The four blocks result, that is
the BMW algebra and the four blocks skein relation, is enough to define new
knot invariant, which depends on three arbitrary parameters, important in knot
theory.

ultimate purpose of implementing it in hydrodynamical simulations. We simplify
the previous model in such a way that some model-dependent assumptions are
replaced with simpler functional forms. For the first test of the developed
framework, we apply it to a one-zone chemical evolution model of a galaxy,
confirming that our new model satisfactorily reproduces the previous results
and that efficient coagulation of small grains produced by shattering and
accretion is essential in reproducing the so-called MRN grain size
distribution. For the next step, in order to test if our model can be treated
together with the hydrodynamical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM), we
post-process a hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy using the
new grain evolution model. We sample hydrodynamical particles representing each
of the dense and diffuse ISM phases. By this post-processing, we find that the
processes occurring in the dense gas (grain growth by accretion and
coagulation) are important in reproducing the grain size distribution
consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve. In our model, the grain size
distributions are similar between the dense and diffuse ISM, although we
observe a larger dispersion in the dense ISM. Moreover, we also show that even
if we degrade the grain radius resolution (with 16 grid points), the overall
shape of grain size distribution (and of resulting extinction curve) can be
captured.

these orbitals varies with the substrate on which CuPc is adsorbed. Starting
from density functional theory calculations, we determine the parameters for
the AIM embedded in a noninteracting environment that describes the residual

already properly described by a single orbital AIM, for CuPc on Ag(111) the
three orbital AIM problem can be simplified into a two orbital problem coupled
to the localized spin of the third orbital. This results in a Kondo effect with
a mixed character, displaying a symmetry between SU(2) and SU(4). The computed
Kondo temperature is in good agreement with experimental values. To solve the
impurity problem we use the recently developed fork tensor product state

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab224a",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two fundamental properties of stellar magnetic fields have been determined by
observations for solar-like stars with different Rossby numbers (Ro), namely,
the magnetic field strength and the magnetic cycle period. The field strength
exhibits two regimes: 1) for fast rotation it is independent of Ro, 2) for slow
rotation it decays with Ro following a power law. For the magnetic cycle period
two regimes of activity, the active and inactive branches, also have been
identified. For both of them, the longer the rotation period, the longer the
activity cycle. Using global dynamo simulations of solar like stars with Rossby
numbers between ~0.4 and ~2, this paper explores the relevance of rotational
shear layers in determining these observational properties. Our results,
consistent with non-linear alpha^2-Omega dynamos, show that the total magnetic
field strength is independent of the rotation period. Yet at surface levels,
the origin of the magnetic field is determined by Ro. While for Ro<1 it is
generated in the convection zone, for Ro>1 strong toroidal fields are generated
at the tachocline and rapidly emerge towards the surface. In agreement with the
observations, the magnetic cycle period increases with the rotational period.
However, a bifurcation is observed for Ro~1, separating a regime where
oscillatory dynamos operate mainly in the convection zone, from the regime
where the tachocline has a predominant role. In the latter the cycles are
believed to result from the periodic energy exchange between the dynamo and the
magneto-shear instabilities developing in the tachocline and the radiative
interior.

superconducting phase in graphene can be induced via lithium deposition.
However, the canonical character of the lithium-decorated graphene (LiC$_{6}$)
superconductor postulated therein, as defined by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) theory, is ambiguous due to the moderate electron-phonon coupling
constant and low Fermi energy in this material. Herein, this issue is addressed
within the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism and beyond it via the first-order
electron-phonon vertex corrections, to account for the potentially pivotal
effects, hitherto not captured. The conducted analysis yields similar value of
the metal-superconductor transition temperature as in the previous studies
($T_{C} \sim 6$ K), yet for a weaker depairing electron correlations, which
magnitude in the non-adiabatic regime approaches predictions of the
Morel-Anderson model. Moreover, the characteristic ratio of the pairing gap and
the inverse temperature is found to notably exceeds estimates of the BCS
theory. In a results, it is argued that the superconducting state in LiC$_{6}$
may have non-canonical character strongly influenced by the non-adiabatic and
retardation effects. Moreover, discussed phase appears as a vital case study,
which suggests that other two-dimensional superconductors of hexagonal
structure may exhibit similar non-canonical behavior as LiC$_{6}$.

intersection of curves with spline surfaces in isogeometric analysis. The
intersection points are determined in one-shot without resorting to a
Newton-Raphson iteration or successive refinement. Surface-curve intersection
is required in a wide range of applications, including contact, immersed
boundary methods and lattice-skin structures, and requires usually the solution
of a system of nonlinear equations. It is assumed that the surface is given in
form of a spline, such as a NURBS, T-spline or Catmull-Clark subdivision
surface, and is convertible into a collection of B\'ezier patches. First, a
hierarchical bounding volume tree is used to efficiently identify the B\'ezier
patches with a convex-hull intersecting the convex-hull of a given curve
segment. For ease of implementation convex-hulls are approximated with k-dops
(discrete orientation polytopes). Subsequently, the intersections of the
identified B\'ezier patches with the curve segment are determined with a
matrix-based implicit representation leading to the computation of a sequence
of small singular value decompositions (SVDs). As an application of the
developed interrogation technique the isogeometric design and analysis of
lattice-skin structures is investigated. The skin is a spline surface that is
usually created in a computer-aided design (CAD) system and the periodic
lattice to be fitted consists of unit cells, each containing a small number of
struts. The lattice-skin structure is generated by projecting selected lattice
nodes onto the surface after determining the intersection of unit cell edges
with the surface. For mechanical analysis, the skin is modelled as a
Kirchhoff-Love thin-shell and the lattice as a pin-jointed truss. The two types
of structures are coupled with a standard Lagrange multiplier approach.

rapidly. Two qualitatively different modes of fast adaptation have been
proposed: selective sweeps wherein large shifts in the allele frequencies occur
at a few loci and evolution via small changes in the allele frequencies at many
loci. While the first process has been thoroughly investigated within the
framework of population genetics, the latter is based on quantitative genetics
and is much less understood. Here we summarize results from our recent
theoretical studies of a quantitative genetic model of polygenic adaptation
that makes explicit reference to population genetics to bridge the gap between
the two frameworks. Our key results are that polygenic adaptation may be a
rapid process and can proceed via subtle or dramatic changes in the allele
frequency depending on the sizes of the phenotypic effects relative to a
threshold value. We also discuss how the signals of polygenic selection may be
detected in the genome. While powerful methods are available to identify
signatures of selective sweeps at loci controling quantitative traits, the
development of statistical tests for detecting small shifts of allele
frequencies at quantitative trait loci is still in its infancy.

fixation probability of a favorable mutation in large asexual populations.
While the hindering effect of strongly deleterious mutations on adaptive
evolution has been well studied, how weak deleterious mutations, either in
isolation or with superior beneficial mutations, influence the fixation of a
beneficial mutation has not been fully explored. Here, using a multitype
branching process, we obtain an accurate analytical expression for the fixation
probability when deleterious effects are weak, and exploit this result along
with the clonal interference theory to investigate the joint effect of linked
beneficial and deleterious mutations on the rate of adaptation. We find that
when the mutation rate is increased beyond the beneficial fitness effect, the
fixation probability of the beneficial mutant decreases from Haldane's
classical result towards zero. This has the consequence that above a critical
mutation rate that may depend on the population size, the adaptation rate
decreases exponentially with the mutation rate and is independent of the
population size. In addition, we find that for a range of mutation rates, both
beneficial and deleterious mutations interfere and impede the adaptation
process in large populations. We also study the evolution of mutation rates in
adapting asexual populations, and conclude that linked beneficial mutations
have a stronger influence on mutator fixation than the deleterious mutations.

Unfortunately, deep learning-based approaches are not well established for

ingredients of the global existence proof, we rely on a local weak solvability
result for our problem, uniform estimates of the solution, integral estimates
on quantities defined at the free boundary, as well as a fine pointwise lower
bound for the position of the moving boundary. Some of the estimates are
time-independent. They allow us to explore the large time behavior of the
position of the moving boundary. The approach is specific to one-dimensional

demonstrates chaos, characterized by one positive Lyapunov exponent, and for
systems of four and five elements there are, respectively, two and three
positive exponents (`hyperchaos'). An algorithm has been implemented that
allows calculating the sectional curvature of a manifold in the course of
numerical simulation of the dynamics at points of a trajectory. In the case of
$N$=3, curvature of the two-dimensional manifold is negative (except for a
finite number of points where it is zero), and Anosov's geodesic flow is
realized. For $N$=4 and 5, the computations show that the condition of negative
sectional curvature is not fulfilled. Also the methodology is explained and
applied for testing hyperbolicity based on numerical analysis of the angles
between the subspaces of small perturbation vectors; in the case of $N$=3, the

in 1978, by Erd\"" os, Simonovits and S\' os. For given graphs $G$ and $H$ the
\emph{anti-Ramsey number} $\textrm{ar}(G,H)$ is defined to be the maximum
number $k$ such that there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to the edges of
$G$ in which every copy of $H$ in $G$ has at least two edges with the same
color.
  There are works on the computational complexity of the problem when $H$ is a
star. Along this line of research, we study the complexity of computing the
anti-Ramsey number $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$, where $P_k$ is a path of length $k$.
First, we observe that when $k = \Omega(n)$, the problem is hard; hence, the
challenging part is the computational complexity of the problem when $k$ is a
fixed constant.
  We provide a characterization of the problem for paths of constant length.
Our first main contribution is to prove that computing $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$ for
every integer $k>2$ is NP-hard. We obtain this by providing several structural
properties of such coloring in graphs. We investigate further and show that
approximating $\textrm{ar}(G,P_3)$ to a factor of $n^{-1/2 - \epsilon}$ is hard
already in $3$-partite graphs, unless P=NP. We also study the exact complexity
of the precolored version and show that there is no subexponential algorithm
for the problem unless ETH fails for any fixed constant $k$.
  Given the hardness of approximation and parametrization of the problem, it is
natural to study the problem on restricted graph families. We introduce the
notion of color connected coloring and employing this structural property. We
obtain a linear time algorithm to compute $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$, for every
integer $k$, when the host graph, $G$, is a tree.

CALIFA DR3 is considered. We adopted the Fourier amplitude A2 of the surface
brightness as a quantitative characteristic of the strength of non-axisymmetric
structures in a galactic disk, in addition to the commonly used morphologic
division for A, AB, and B types based on the Hubble classification. To
distinguish changes in local oxygen abundance caused by the non-axisymmetrical
structures, the multiparametric mass--metallicity relation was constructed as a
function of parameters such as the bar/spiral pattern strength, the disk size,
color index g-r in the SDSS bands, and central surface brightness of the disk.
The gas-phase oxygen abundance gradient is determined by using the R
calibration. We find that there is no significant impact of the
non-axisymmetric structures such as a bar and/or spiral patterns on the local
oxygen abundance and radial oxygen abundance gradient of disk galaxies.
Galaxies with higher mass, however, exhibit flatter oxygen abundance gradients
in units of dex/kpc, but this effect is significantly less prominent for the
oxygen abundance gradients in units of dex/R25 and almost disappears when the
inner parts are avoided. We show that the oxygen abundance in the central part
of the galaxy depends neither on the optical radius R25 nor on the color g-r or
the surface brightness of the galaxy. Instead, outside the central part of the
galaxy, the oxygen abundance increases with g-r value and central surface
brightness of the disk.

unnormalised models and posterior inference of latent variables. The developed
theory shows that VNCE has the same level of generality as standard VI, meaning
that advances made there can be directly imported to the unnormalised setting.
We validate VNCE on toy models and apply it to a realistic problem of
estimating an undirected graphical model from incomplete data.

lag between the start and end times of transactions. Customers need to wait for
completion of their transaction (order fulfillment) and hence are also
interested in their waiting time as a Quality of Service (QoS) attribute. So,
they factor this QoS in the demand they offer to the firm (service-provider)
and some customers (user-set) would be willing to pay for shorter waiting
times. On the other hand, such waiting times depend on the demand user-set
offers to the service-provider. We model the above economic-QoS strategic
interaction between service-provider and user-set under a fairly generic
scheduling framework as a non-cooperative constrained game. We use an existing
joint pricing and scheduling model. An optimal solution to this joint pricing

alternating sign matrices involving the third root of unity. In this paper we
prove that her formula, when replacing the third root of unity by an
indeterminate $q$, is actually the $(2+q+q^{-1})$-enumeration of alternating
sign matrices. By evaluating a generalisation of this determinant we are able
to reprove a conjecture of Mills, Robbins and Rumsey stating that the
$Q$-enumeration is a product of two polynomials in $Q$. Further we provide a
closed product formula for the generalised determinant in the 0-,1- 2- and
3-enumeration case, leading to a new proof of the $1$-,$2$- and $3$-enumeration
of alternating sign matrices, and a factorisation in the $4$-enumeration case.
Finally we relate the $1$-enumeration of our generalised determinant to the
determinant evaluations of Ciucu, Eisenk\""olbl, Krattenthaler and Zare, which
counts weighted cyclically symmetric lozenge tilings of a hexagon with a
triangular hole and is a generalisation of a famous result by Andrews.

100nm. They have unique physical, chemical and mechanical properties, which are
very different from those of large scale materials. This uniqueness is
attributed to the fact that the number of atoms in the surface layer and in the
bulk is commensurable. As the atoms in the surface layer of nanoparticles have
their counterparts from one side only, their balance is impaired, and the
resulting structure relaxation leads to the displacement of atomic spacing in a
2-3nm layer. Therefore the surface layers expand while internal layers
compressed, as these are exposed to an excessive Laplace pressure of up to
hundreds kilobars. Nanoparticles have a highly distorted lattice that has an
effect on activation energy of most of the processes they are involved in, by
changing their nature and sequence. Nanoscale implies absolutely new effects,
properties and processes which are defined by the laws of quantum mechanics,
size quantization in small-scale structures, surface-bulk ratio, and other
factors. Due to exceptionally small sizes and good reactivity of NP particles,
it looks promising to use them in metal melts as crystallization centers to
enable structure refinement of cast products. As well known, the grains are
finer, the better are mechanical properties of cast products produced from
these alloys. After considering a number of options, an efficient method of
nanopowder introduction into a liquid metal was proposed. This method avoids
all of the above problems and consists in pressing of 5-9.5mm diameter rods or

shocks in the solar corona and the interplanetary space. One of the important
signatures of shocks and shock acceleration are Type II solar radio bursts that
drift with the shock speed and produce bands of fundamental and higher harmonic
plasma radio emission. An intriguing aspect of Type II radio bursts is the
occasional split of a harmonic band into thinner lanes, known as
band-splitting. Here, we report a detailed imaging and spectroscopic
observation of a CME-driven shock producing band-splitting in a Type II burst.
Using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), we examine the spatial and temporal
relation of the Type II burst to the associated CME event, use source imaging
to calculate the apparent coronal density, and demonstrate how source imaging
can be used to estimate projection effects. We consider two widely accepted
band-splitting models that make opposing predictions regarding the locations of
the true emission sources with respect to the shock front. Our observations
suggest that the locations of the upper and lower sub-band sources are
spatially separated by $\sim 0.2 \pm 0.05 \, \mathrm{R_\odot}$. However, we
quantitatively show, for the first time, that such separation is consistent
with radio-wave scattering of plasma radio emission from a single region,
implying that the split-band Type II sources could originate from nearly
co-spatial locations. Considering the effects of scattering, the observations
provide supporting evidence for the model that interprets the band-splitting as
emission originating in the upstream and downstream regions of the shock front,
two virtually co-spatial areas.

flexibility and adaptivity of deep learning. To understand this phenomenon
theoretically, we develop a new approximation and estimation error analysis of
deep learning with the ReLU activation for functions in a Besov space and its
variant with mixed smoothness. The Besov space is a considerably general
function space including the Holder space and Sobolev space, and especially can
capture spatial inhomogeneity of smoothness. Through the analysis in the Besov
space, it is shown that deep learning can achieve the minimax optimal rate and
outperform any non-adaptive (linear) estimator such as kernel ridge regression,
which shows that deep learning has higher adaptivity to the spatial
inhomogeneity of the target function than other estimators such as linear ones.
In addition to this, it is shown that deep learning can avoid the curse of
dimensionality if the target function is in a mixed smooth Besov space. We also
show that the dependency of the convergence rate on the dimensionality is tight
due to its minimax optimality. These results support high adaptivity of deep
learning and its superior ability as a feature extractor.

  Hovering & Traveling Time Dilemma of UAVs","accepted to IEEE Transaction on Wireless communications",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The next era of information revolution will rely on aggregating big data from
massive numbers of devices that are widely scattered in our environment. Most
of these devices are expected to be of low-complexity, low-cost, and limited
power supply, which impose stringent constraints on the network operation. In
this regard, this paper investigates aerial data aggregation and field
estimation from a finite spatial field via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
Instead of fusing, relaying, and routing the data across the wireless nodes to
fixed locations access points, a UAV flies over the field and collects the
required data for two prominent missions; data aggregation and field
estimation. To accomplish these tasks, the field of interest is divided into
several subregions over which the UAV hovers to collect samples from the
underlying nodes. To this end, we formulate and solve an optimization problem
to minimize total hovering and traveling time of each mission. While the former
requires the collection of a prescribed average number of samples from the
field, the latter ensures for a given field spatial correlation model that the
average mean-squared estimation error of the field value is no more than a
predetermined threshold at any point. These goals are fulfilled by optimizing
the number of subregions, the area of each subregion, the hovering locations,
the hovering time at each location, and the trajectory traversed between
hovering locations. The proposed formulation is shown to be np-hard mixed
integer problem, and hence, a decoupled heuristic solution is proposed. The
results show that there exists an optimal number of subregions that balance the
tradeoff between hovering and traveling times such that the total time for
collecting the required samples is minimized.

to achieve different compression qualities. To address these problems, we
proposed an implicit dual-domain convolutional network (IDCN) with the pixel

proposed an extractor-corrector framework-based dual-domain correction unit
(DCU) as the basic component to formulate the IDCN. A dense block was
introduced to improve the performance of extractor in DRU. The implicit
dual-domain translation allows the IDCN to handle color images with the

structure are often the method of choice for the reliable approximation of
many-particle wave functions and energies. The exponential scaling, however,
limits their application range. An efficient approximation to the full
configuration interaction solution can be obtained with the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm without a restriction to a predefined
excitation level. In a standard DMRG implementation, however, excited states
are calculated with a ground-state optimization in the space orthogonal to all
lower lying wave function solutions. A trivial parallelization is therefore not
possible and the calculation of highly excited states becomes prohibitively
expensive, especially in regions with a high density of states. Here, we
introduce two variants of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm
that allow us to target directly specific energy regions and therefore highly
excited states. The first one, based on shift-and-invert techniques, is
particularly efficient for low-lying states, but is not stable in regions with
a high density of states. The second one, based on the folded auxiliary
operator, is less efficient, but more accurate in targeting high-energy states.
We apply the algorithm to the solution of the nuclear Schroedinger equation,
but emphasize that it can be applied to the diagonalization of general
Hamiltonians as well, such as the electronic Coulomb Hamiltonian to address
X-ray spectra. In combination with several root-homing algorithms and a
stochastic sampling of the determinant space, excited states of interest can be
adequately tracked and analyzed during the optimization. We demonstrate that we
can accurately calculate prominent spectral features of large molecules such as
the sarcosyn-glycine dipeptide.

boundary within a two-phase microstructure the effect of the phase contrast on
the internal stress field due to the dislocations needs to be taken into
account. For this purpose a 2D semi-discrete model is proposed in this paper.
It consists of two distinct phases, each with its specific material properties,
separated by a fully coherent and non-damaging phase boundary. Each phase is
modelled as a continuum enriched with a Peierls--Nabarro (PN) dislocation
region, confining dislocation motion to a discrete plane, the glide plane. In
this paper, a single glide plane perpendicular to and continuous across the
phase boundary is considered. Along the glide plane bulk induced shear
tractions are balanced by glide plane shear tractions based on the classical PN
model. The model's ability to capture dislocation obstruction at phase
boundaries, dislocation pile-ups and dislocation transmission is studied.
Results show that the phase contrast in material properties (e.g. elastic
stiffness, glide plane properties) alone creates a barrier to the motion of
dislocations from a soft to a hard phase. The proposed model accounts for the
interplay between dislocations, external boundaries and phase boundary and thus
represents a suitable tool for studying edge dislocation--phase boundary
interaction in two-phase microstructures.

at the dendrites of the presynaptic termi- nal to an analogous wave at the
synaptic cleft and back to a digital pulse when they achieve the required
voltage for the generation of an action potential at the postsynaptic neuron.
The main question of this research is what processes are generating the
oscillatory wave signal at the synaptic cleft and what is the best model for
this phenomenon. Here, it is proposed a model of the synapse as an oscillatory
system capable of synchronization taking into account conservation of
information and consequently of frequency at the interior of the synaptic
cleft. Trains of action potentials certainly encode and transmit information
along the nervous system but most of the time neurons are not transmitting
action potentials, 99 percent of their time neurons are in the sub threshold
regime were only small signals without the energy to emanate an action
potential are carrying the majority of information. The proposed model for a
synapse, smooths the train of action potential and keeps its frequency.
Synapses are presented here as a system composed of an input wave that is
transformed through interferometry. The collective synaptic interference
pattern of waves will reflect the points of maximum amplitude for the density

$\theta\in[0,\pi/2)$, all its sections along straight lines with inclination

optimization theory. It has also be independently used, under the name of
""rectilinear convexity"", in computational geometry. We are concerned here with
the problem of asymptotically reconstructing (or estimating) a biconvex set $S$

convex case, one would like to define the ""biconvex hull"" of the sample points

translation to the biconvex case. This is in sharp contrast with the well-known
elementary definition of convex hull. Thus, we have selected the most commonly
accepted notion of ""biconvex hull"" (often called ""rectilinear convex hull""): we
first provide additional motivations for this definition, proving some useful
relations with other convexity-related notions. Then, we prove some results
concerning the consistent approximation of a biconvex set $S$ and and the

security has gradually emerged. Most existing machine learning algorithms may
be attacked by adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a slightly
modified input sample that can lead to a false result of machine learning
algorithms. The adversarial examples pose a potential security threat for many
AI application areas, especially in the domain of robot path planning. In this
field, the adversarial examples obstruct the algorithm by adding obstacles to
the normal maps, resulting in multiple effects on the predicted path. However,
there is no suitable approach to automatically identify them. To our knowledge,
all previous work uses manual observation method to estimate the attack results
of adversarial maps, which is time-consuming. Aiming at the existing problem,
this paper explores a method to automatically identify the adversarial examples
in Value Iteration Networks (VIN), which has a strong generalization ability.
We analyze the possible scenarios caused by the adversarial maps. We propose a
training-based identification approach to VIN adversarial examples by combing
the path feature comparison and path image classification. We evaluate our
method using the adversarial maps dataset, show that our method can achieve a
high-accuracy and faster identification than manual observation method.

models including these elements at the appropriate high abundance provide
sufficiently accurate approximations to the temperature stratification of full
models. No indications for binarity were found, neither radial velocity
variations nor photometric evidence. All stars have atmospheres almost free of
H and Teff =42000K to 47000K, and log g= 5.4 to 5.7. CD-31 4800 displays the
signatures of CNO burning, while heavier elements are subsolar by ~0.4 dex,
except Ne & Si being ~solar. The C-rich He-sdOs show a slightly subsolar
metallicity accompanied by N-enrichment and O-deficiency. Ne is enriched up to
a factor of ten with respect to the sun in LS IV+10 9. Stellar masses scatter
around the canonical helium core flash mass. The abundance pattern of CD-31

abundance pattern dissimilar to those determined for the C-rich stars.
[CW83]0904-02, though, may be a candidate for a composite He-WD merger, as it
rotates and is more massive than the other stars. New evolutionary models for

dimensions, this superconvergence result in three dimensions is not a trivial
extension of the recent superconvergence result in two dimensions
\cite{sup_LWW2018} from rectangular partitions to cubic partitions. The error
estimate for the numerical gradient in the $L^{2}$-norm arrives at a
superconvergence order of ${\cal O}(h^r) (1.5 \leq r\leq 2)$ when the lowest
order weak Galerkin finite elements consisting of piecewise linear polynomials
in the interior of the elements and piecewise constants on the faces of the
elements are employed. A series of numerical experiments are illustrated to
confirm the established superconvergence theory in three dimensions.

These transformations are indeed a symmetry of the theory in Noether sense. The
associated constant of motion is the difference in the intensity between self-

the difference between the right and left circularly polarized components. This
conservation law holds even if the electromagnetic field interacts with an
arbitrary classical gravitational background. After re-examining these results,
we discuss whether this symmetry is maintained when the electromagnetic field
is quantized. The answer is in the affirmative in the absence of gravity, but
not necessarily otherwise. As a consequence, the net polarization of the
quantum electromagnetic field fails to be conserved in curved spacetimes. This
is a quantum effect, and it can be understood as the generalization of the

realized by coupling atoms in a lattice to a membrane. While such system
promises a viable contender in the competitive field of simulating
non-equilibrium many-body physics, its complete steady-state phase diagram is
still lacking. Here we study the phase diagram of this hybrid system based on
an atomic Bose-Hubbard model coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator. We take
both the expectation value of the bosonic operator and the mechanical motion of
the membrane as order parameters, and thereby identify four different quantum
phases. Importantly, we find the atomic gas in the steady state of such

the atom-membrane coupling is tuned to increase. Such steady-state phase
transition can be seen as the non-equilibrium counterpart of the conventional
superfluid-Mott-insulator transition in the ground state of Bose-Hubbard model.
Further, no matter which phase the quantum gas is in, the mechanic motion of
the membrane exhibits a transition from an incoherent vibration to a coherent
one when the atom-membrane coupling increases, agreeing with the experimental
observations. Our present study provides a simple way to study non-equilibrium
many-body physics that is complementary to ongoing experiments on the hybrid

$(1-\varepsilon)/n$ (subcritical case) to $1/n$ and then to $(1+\varepsilon)/n$
(supercritical case) for $\varepsilon>0$, with high probability the order of
the largest component increases smoothly from
$O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log(\varepsilon^3 n))$ to $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ and then to $(1
\pm o(1)) 2 \varepsilon n$.
  As a natural generalisation of random graphs and connectedness, we consider
the binomial random $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}^k(n,p)$ (where each
$k$-tuple of vertices is present as a hyperedge with probability $p$
independently) and the following notion of high-order connectedness. Given an
integer $1 \leq j \leq k-1$, two sets of $j$ vertices are called
\emph{$j$-connected} if there is a walk of hyperedges between them such that
any two consecutive hyperedges intersect in at least $j$ vertices. A
$j$-connected component is a maximal collection of pairwise $j$-connected
$j$-tuples of vertices. Recently, the threshold for the appearance of the giant
$j$-connected component in $\mathcal{H}^k(n,p)$ and its order were determined.
In this article, we take a closer look at the subcritical random hypergraph. We
determine the structure, order, and size of the largest $j$-connected
components, with the help of a certain class of `hypertrees' and related
objects. In our proofs, we combine various probabilistic and enumerative
techniques, such as generating functions and couplings with branching
processes. Our study will pave the way to establishing a symmetry between the
subcritical random hypergraph and the hypergraph obtained from the
supercritical random hypergraph by deleting its giant $j$-connected component.

following the same homogeneous process (ARES+MOOG). The host star parameters
were then merged together with the planet properties listed in exoplanet.eu to

some unknown position of the environment. Such problems are typically
considered to be of an on-line nature, in that the input is unknown to the
searcher, and the performance of a search strategy is usually analyzed by means
of the standard framework of the competitive ratio, which compares the cost
incurred by the searcher to an optimal strategy that knows the location of the
target. However, one can argue that even for simple search problems,
competitive analysis fails to distinguish between strategies which,
intuitively, should have different performance in practice.
  Motivated by the above, in this work we introduce and study measures
supplementary to competitive analysis in the context of search problems. In
particular, we focus on the well-known problem of linear search, informally
known as the cow-path problem, for which there is an infinite number of
strategies that achieve an optimal competitive ratio equal to 9. We propose a
measure that reflects the rate at which the line is being explored by the
searcher, and which can be seen as an extension of the bijective ratio over an
uncountable set of requests. Using this measure we show that a natural strategy
that explores the line aggressively is optimal among all 9-competitive
strategies. This provides, in particular, a strict separation from the
competitively optimal doubling strategy, which is much more conservative in
terms of exploration. We also provide evidence that this aggressiveness is
requisite for optimality, by showing that any optimal strategy must mimic the
aggressive strategy in its first few explorations.

role in the evolution from traditional power systems to Smart Grids.
Increasingly fluctuating power flows, sparked by the transition towards
sustainable energy generation, become a major issue for power grid stability.
To deal with this challenge, future Smart Grids require precise monitoring and
control, which in turn demand for reliable, real-time capable and
cost-efficient communications. For this purpose, we propose applying
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to handle the manifold requirements of Smart
Grid communications. To achieve reliability, our approach encompasses fast
recovery after failures in the communication network and dynamic service-aware
network (re-)configuration. Network Calculus (NC) logic is embedded into our
SDN controller for meeting latency requirements imposed by the standard IEC
61850 of the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC). Thus, routing
provides delay-optimal paths under consideration of existing cross traffic.
Also, continuous latency bound compliance is ensured by combining NC delay
supervision with means of flexible reconfiguration. For evaluation we consider
the well-known Nordic 32 test system, on which we map a corresponding
communication network in both experiment and emulation. The described
functionalities are validated, employing realistic IEC 61850 transmissions and
distributed control traffic. Our results show that hard service guarantees can
be ensured with the help of the proposed SDN solution. On this basis, we derive
extremely time critical services, which must not be subjected to flexible
reconfiguration.

transfer the generalization ability of a large (teacher) deep network to a

transferring the probability distribution of the softmax layer in a teacher
network and thus neglect the intermediate representations. In this paper, we
propose a knowledge transfer adversarial network to better train a student
network. Our technique holistically considers both intermediate representations
and probability distributions of a teacher network. To transfer the knowledge
of intermediate representations, we set high-level teacher feature maps as a
target, toward which the student feature maps are trained. Specifically, we
arrange a Teacher-to-Student layer for enabling our framework suitable for
various student structures. The intermediate representation helps the student
network better understand the transferred generalization as compared to the
probability distribution only. Furthermore, we infuse an adversarial learning
process by employing a discriminator network, which can fully exploit the
spatial correlation of feature maps in training a student network. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly
improve the performance of a student network on both image classification and

two macroscopically quantum states join at the interface. Despite longstanding
efforts, however, experimental understanding of this system has not been
settled yet. One of the reasons is that most semiconductors hosting
high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) usually form Schottky
barriers at the metal contacts, preventing efficient proximity between the
quantum Hall edge states and Cooper pairs. Only recently have relatively
transparent 2DES/superconductor junctions been investigated in graphene. In
this study, we propose another material system for investigating
2DES/superconductor junctions, that is ZnO-based heterostrcuture. Due to the
ionic nature of ZnO, a Schottky barrier is not effectively formed at the
contact with a superconductor MoGe, as evidenced by the appearance of Andreev
reflection at low temperatures. With applying magnetic field, while clear
quantum Hall effect is observed for ZnO 2DES, conductance across the junction
oscillates with the filling factor of the quantum Hall states. We find that
Andreev reflection is suppressed in the well developed quantum Hall regimes,
which we interpret as a result of equal probabilities of normal and Andreev
reflections as a result of multiple Andreev reflection at the
2DES/superconductor interface.

energy to prevent the gravitational collapse of the Sun and give rise to the by
now well-studied pp, 7Be, and 8B solar neutrinos. The not yet measured flux of

for the compositional way in which humans structure a visual scene in terms of
objects has frequently been overlooked. In this work, we investigate object
compositionality as an inductive bias for Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs). We present a minimal modification of a standard generator to
incorporate this inductive bias and find that it reliably learns to generate
images as compositions of objects. Using this general design as a backbone, we
then propose two useful extensions to incorporate dependencies among objects

image datasets and highlight the merits of incorporating structure for
representation learning purposes. In particular, we find that our structured
GANs are better at generating multi-object images that are more faithful to the
reference distribution. More so, we demonstrate how, by leveraging the
structure of the learned generative process, one can `invert' the learned

the transition to a deconfined phase occurs. The brane configurations
corresponding to the bulk instantons are analysed and it is shown that they

deconfinement phase on the other side, we have a configuration that allows a
higher degree of quantum error protection, still preventing the maximal

patient overcrowding is one of the major challenges faced by hospitals.
Unnecessary and annoying waits for long periods result in substantial human

each patient in the queue, the total treatment time of all patients before him
is the time that he must wait. It would be convenient and preferable if the
patients could receive the most efficient treatment plan and know the predicted
waiting time through a mobile application that updates in real-time. Therefore,
we propose a Patient Treatment Time Prediction (PTTP) algorithm to predict the
waiting time for each treatment task for a patient. We use realistic patient
data from various hospitals to obtain a patient treatment time model for each
task. Based on this large-scale, realistic dataset, the treatment time for each

waiting time, a Hospital Queuing-Recommendation (HQR) system is developed. HQR
calculates and predicts an efficient and convenient treatment plan recommended

efficiency and low-latency response. We use an Apache Spark-based cloud

of the millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being tested
simultaneously. Furthermore, it does not consider the functional genetic effect
on the response variable; i.e., it ignores more complex joint effects of nearby
SNPs within a region. Our proposed method screens the entire genome for
associations using a sequential sliding-window approach based on wavelets. A
sequence of SNPs represents a genetic signal, and for every screened region, we
transform the genetic signal into the wavelet space. We then estimate the
proportion of wavelet coefficients associated with the phenotype at different
scales. The significance of a region is assessed via simulations, taking
advantage of a recent result on Bayes factor distributions. Our new approach
reduces the number of independent tests to be performed. Moreover, we show via
