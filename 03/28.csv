energy of the finite two-dimensional square lattice Ising model with periodic
and antiperiodic boundary conditions, variable aspect ratio, and anisotropic
couplings, as well as for the corresponding universal free energy finite-size
scaling functions. Therefore, we review the dimer mapping, as well as the
interplay between its topology and the different types of boundary conditions.
As a central result, we show how both the finite system as well as the scaling
form decay into contributions for the bulk, a characteristic finite-size part,
and - if present - the surface tension, which emerges due to at least one
antiperiodic boundary in the system. For the scaling limit we extend the proper
finite-size scaling theory to the anisotropic case and show how this anisotropy
can be absorbed into suitable scaling variables.

well-known and widely used iterative algorithm is the Newton's method. However,
its convergence depends heavily on the initial guess, with poor choices often
leading to slow convergence or even divergence. In this paper, we present a new
class of methods that improve upon the classical Newton's method. The key idea
behind the new approach is to develop a relatively simple multiplicative
transformation of the original equations, which leads to a significant
reduction in nonlinearities, thereby alleviating the limitations of the
Newton's method. Based on this idea, we propose two novel classes of methods
and present their application to several mathematical functions (real, complex,
and vector). Across all examples, our numerical experiments suggest that the
new methods converge for a significantly wider range of initial guesses with
minimal increase in computational cost. Given the ubiquity of Newton's method,
an improvement in its applicability and convergence is a significant step
forward, and will reduce computation times several-folds across many
disciplines. Additionally, this multiplicative transformation may improve other
techniques where a linear approximation is used.

driving. They deliver a more complete view of what is happening around the car.
Human drivers also heavily exploit their mental map for navigation.
Nonetheless, several methods have been published that learn driving models with
only a front-facing camera and without a route planner. This lack of
information renders the self-driving task quite intractable. We investigate the
problem in a more realistic setting, which consists of a surround-view camera
system with eight cameras, a route planner, and a CAN bus reader. In
particular, we develop a sensor setup that provides data for a 360-degree view
of the area surrounding the vehicle, the driving route to the destination, and
low-level driving maneuvers (e.g. steering angle and speed) by human drivers.
With such a sensor setup we collect a new driving dataset, covering diverse
driving scenarios and varying weather/illumination conditions. Finally, we
learn a novel driving model by integrating information from the surround-view
cameras and the route planner. Two route planners are exploited: 1) by
representing the planned routes on OpenStreetMap as a stack of GPS coordinates,
and 2) by rendering the planned routes on TomTom Go Mobile and recording the
progression into a video. Our experiments show that: 1) 360-degree
surround-view cameras help avoid failures made with a single front-view camera,
in particular for city driving and intersection scenarios; and 2) route
planners help the driving task significantly, especially for steering angle
prediction.

explore the morphology of the region we compare archival infrared, optical and

perform a quantitative analysis, using both LTE and non-LTE methods to
determine the abundances of some of the observed species as well as kinetic
temperatures and volume densities. Bright CO, [CII] and [CI] emission has been
found towards the HII region and the photodissociation region (PDR) in M8. Our
analysis places the bulk of the molecular material in the background of the
nebulosity illuminated by the bright stellar systems Her 36 and 9 Sagitarii.
Since the emission from all observed atomic and molecular tracers peaks at or
close to the position of Her 36, we conclude that the star is still physically
close to its natal dense cloud core and heats it. A veil of warm gas moves away
from Her 36 toward the Sun and its associated dust contributes to the
foreground extinction in the region. One of the most prominent star forming
regions in M8, the Hourglass Nebula, is particularly bright due to cracks in
this veil close to Her 36. By using radiative transfer modeling of different
transitions of CO isotopologues, we obtain H$_{2}$ densities ranging from $\sim

massive wave packet $\sigma_{\perp}$ is much larger than its Compton wavelength
$\lambda_c = \hbar/mc$. For Gaussian beams or for packets with the non-singular
phases (say, the Airy beams), corrections to this approximation are attenuated
as $\lambda_c^2/\sigma_{\perp}^2 \ll 1$ and usually negligible. Here we show
that this situation drastically changes for particles with the phase vortices
associated with an orbital angular momentum $\ell\hbar$. For highly twisted
beams with $|\ell| \gg 1$, the non-paraxial corrections get $|\ell|$ times
enhanced and $|\ell|$ can already be as large as $10^3$. We describe the
relativistic wave packets, both for vortex bosons and fermions, which transform
correctly under the Lorentz boosts, are localized in a 3D space, and represent
a non-paraxial generalization of the massive Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We
compare such states with their paraxial counterpart paying specific attention
to the relativistic effects and to the differences from the twisted photons. In
particular, a Gouy phase is found to be Lorentz invariant and it generally
depends on time rather than on a distance $z$. By calculating the electron
packet's mean invariant mass, magnetic moment, etc., we demonstrate that the
non-paraxial corrections can already reach the relative values of $10^{-3}$.
These states and the non-paraxial effects can be relevant for the proper
description of the spin-orbit phenomena in relativistic vortex beams, of
scattering of the focused packets by atomic targets, of collision processes in

geometries. We focus on two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we fix
the connection to be metric compatible, but we follow a completely covariant
approach by imposing the constraints with suitable Lagrange multipliers. For a
general quadratic theory we show how torsion naturally propagates and we
reproduce the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity as a particular
quadratic action that features an additional Lorentz symmetry. We then study
the much less explored theories formulated in a geometry with neither curvature
nor torsion, so that all the geometrical information is encoded in the
non-metricity. We discuss how this geometrical framework leads to a purely
inertial connection that can thus be completely removed by a coordinate gauge
choice, the coincident gauge. From the quadratic theory we recover a simpler
formulation of General Relativity in the form of the Einstein action, which
enjoys an enhanced symmetry that reduces to a second linearised diffeomorphism
at linear order. More general theories in both geometries can be formulated
consistently by taking into account the inertial connection and the associated
additional degrees of freedom. As immediate applications, the new cosmological
equations and their Newtonian limit are considered, where the role of the lapse
in the consistency of the equations is clarified, and the Schwarzschild black
hole entropy is computed by evaluating the corresponding Euclidean action. We
discuss how the boundary terms in the usual formulation of General Relativity
are related to different choices of coordinates in its coincident version and
show that in isotropic coordinates the Euclidean action is finite without the
need to introduce boundary or normalisation terms.

problem in computer vision. Current techniques either require dense
correspondences and rely on motion and deformation cues, or assume a highly
accurate reconstruction (referred to as a template) of at least a single frame
given in advance and operate in the manner of non-rigid tracking. Accurate
computation of dense point tracks often requires multiple frames and might be
computationally expensive. Availability of a template is a very strong prior
which restricts system operation to a pre-defined environment and scenarios. In
this work, we propose a new hybrid approach for monocular non-rigid

approach, deformation model is learned by a deep neural network, with a
combination of domain-specific loss functions. We train the network with
multiple states of a non-rigidly deforming structure with a known shape at
rest. HDM-Net learns different reconstruction cues including texture-dependent
surface deformations, shading and contours. We show generalisability of HDM-Net

new illumination conditions. Experiments with noisy data and a comparison with
other methods demonstrate robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach and
suggest possible application scenarios of the new technique in interventional

understanding of monads, a programming concept that has an infamous formal
definition, syntactic support in several programming languages and a reputation
for being elegant and powerful, but also intimidating and difficult to grasp.
This paper is not a monad tutorial. It will not tell you what a monad is.
Instead, it helps you understand how computer scientists and programmers talk
about monads and why they do so. To answer these questions, we review the
history of monads in the context of programming and study the development
through the perspectives of philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics
and cognitive sciences. More generally, we present a framework for
understanding programming concepts that considers them at three levels: formal,
metaphorical and implementation. We base such observations on established
results about the scientific method and mathematical entities -- cognitive
sciences suggest that the metaphors used when thinking about monads are more
important than widely accepted, while philosophy of science explains how the
research paradigm from which monads originate influences and restricts their
use. Finally, we provide evidence for why a broader philosophical, sociological
look at programming concepts should be of interest for programmers. It lets us
understand programming concepts better and, fundamentally, choose more
appropriate abstractions as illustrated in number of case studies that conclude
the paper.

parts of software engineering processes, such as build automation and
continuous integration testing. In particular, interactive pipelines, which
process events in a live environment such as an IDE, require timely results for
low-latency feedback, and persistence to retain low-latency feedback between
restarts.
  Inquiry. Developing an incrementalized and persistent version of a pipeline
is one way to reduce feedback latency, but requires dependency tracking, cache
invalidation, and other complicated techniques. Therefore, interactivity
complicates pipeline development if timeliness and persistence become
responsibilities of the pipeline programmer, rather than being supported by the
underlying system.
  Approach. We develop Pipelines for Interactive Environments (PIE), a
Domain-Specific Language (DSL), API, and runtime for developing interactive
software development pipelines, where ease of development is a focus.
  Knowledge. PIE provides a straightforward programming model that enables
direct and concise expression of pipelines without boilerplate, reducing the
development and maintenance effort of pipelines. Compiled pipeline programs can
be embedded into interactive environments such as code editors and IDEs,
enabling timely feedback at a low cost.
  Grounding. Compared to the state of the art, PIE reduces the code required to
express an interactive pipeline by a factor of 6 in a case study on
syntax-aware editors. Furthermore, we evaluate PIE in two case studies of
complex interactive software development scenarios, demonstrating that PIE can
handle complex interactive pipelines in a straightforward and concise way.

new language features that offer many benefits. However, despite these
benefits, developers may not always be willing to adopt them in their projects
for various reasons. In this paper, we describe an empirical study where we
assess the adoption of a particular new language feature. Studying how
developers use (or do not use) new language features is important in
programming language research and engineering because it gives designers
insight into the usability of the language to create meaning programs in that
language. This knowledge, in turn, can drive future innovations in the area.
Here, we explore Java 8 default methods, which allow interfaces to contain
(instance) method implementations.
  Default methods can ease interface evolution, make certain ubiquitous design
patterns redundant, and improve both modularity and maintainability. A focus of
this work is to discover, through a scientific approach and a novel technique,
situations where developers found these constructs useful and where they did
not, and the reasons for each. Although several studies center around assessing
new language features, to the best of our knowledge, this kind of construct has
not been previously considered.
  Despite their benefits, we found that developers did not adopt default
methods in all situations. Our study consisted of submitting pull requests
introducing the language feature to 19 real-world, open source Java projects
without altering original program semantics. This novel assessment technique is
proactive in that the adoption was driven by an automatic refactoring approach
rather than waiting for developers to discover and integrate the feature
themselves. In this way, we set forth best practices and patterns of using the
language feature effectively earlier rather than later and are able to possibly
guide (near) future language evolution. We foresee this technique to be useful
in assessing other new language features, design patterns, and other
programming idioms.

make software more reactive. For example, such demands are evident in systems
consisting of the Internet of Things. Such systems include a set of reactive
values that are periodically updated in response to external or internal events
to form a dataflow in the sense that such updates are propagated to other
reactive values. Two effective approaches for realizing such reactive values
have been proposed: the event mechanisms in event-based programming and the
signals in functional-reactive programming. These two approaches are now
becoming mixed in several languages such as Flapjax and REScala, which makes
these languages notably expressive for modularizing the implementation of
reactive software. For example, REScala provides a rich API that consists of
functions converting events to signals and vice versa.
  In this paper, we explore another, simpler approach in the design space of
reactive programming languages: the event mechanism is harmonized with signals,
resulting in a simplified programming interface that is mostly based on
signals. Based on this approach, we realize SignalJ, a simple extension of Java
with events and signals. Our notable findings are (1) an event can be
represented as an update of a signal and (2) such an effectful signal can be
represented using annotations instead of introducing types and constructors for
signals to further simplify the language.
  Another contribution of this paper is the formal model of SignalJ. As both
mechanisms of events and signals may interfere with each other, this mixing
sometimes results in surprising behavior. For example, the functional behavior
of signals is affected by the imperative features of events. Thus,
understanding the formal model of this mixing is actually important. The core
calculus, Featherweight SignalJ (FSJ), was developed as an extension of
Featherweight Java, and proofs are provided to ensure the soundness of FSJ.

across different programming languages, so that developers do not have to
familiarize themselves with new tooling for new languages. Also, being able to
combine multiple programming languages in a program increases reusability, as
developers do not have to recreate software frameworks and libraries in the
language they develop in and can reuse existing software instead.
  Inquiry: However, developers often have a broad choice of tools, some of
which are designed for only one specific programming language. Various
Integrated Development Environments have support for multiple languages, but
are usually unable to provide a consistent programming experience due to
different language-specific runtime features. With regard to language
integrations, common mechanisms usually use abstraction layers, such as the
operating system or a network connection, which are often boundaries for tools
and hence negatively affect the programming experience.
  Approach: In this paper, we present a novel approach for tool reuse that aims
to improve the experience with regard to working with multiple high-level
dynamic, object-oriented programming languages. As part of this, we build a
multi-language virtual execution environment and reuse Smalltalk's live
programming tools for other languages.
  Knowledge: An important part of our approach is to retrofit and align runtime
capabilities for different languages as it is a requirement for providing
consistent tools. Furthermore, it provides convenient means to reuse and even
mix software libraries and frameworks written in different languages without
breaking tool support.
  Grounding: The prototype system Squimera is an implementation of our approach
and demonstrates that it is possible to reuse both development tools from a
live programming system to improve the development experience as well as
software artifacts from different languages to increase productivity.
  Importance: In the domain of polyglot programming systems, most research has
focused on the integration of different languages and corresponding performance
optimizations. Our work, on the other hand, focuses on tooling and the overall
programming experience.

as debuggers, profilers, and dynamic analysis frameworks are presumed to demand
difficult tradeoffs among implementation complexity (cost), functionality,
usability, and performance. Among the many consequences, tools are often
delivered late (if ever), have limited functionality, require non-standard
configurations, and impose serious performance costs on running programs.
  Inquiry: Can flexible tool support become a practical, first class, intrinsic
requirement for a modern highperformance programming language implementation
framework?
  Approach: We extended the Truffle Language Implementation Framework, which
together with the GraalVM execution environment makes possible very high
performance language implementations. Truffle's new Instrumentation Framework
is language-agnostic and designed to derive high performance from the same
technologies as do language implementations. Truffle Instrumentation includes:
(1) low overhead capture of execution events by dynamically adding ""wrapper""
nodes to executing ASTs; (2) extensions to the Language Implementation
Framework that allow per-language specialization, primarily for visual display
of values and names, among others; and (3) versatile APIs and support services
for implementing many kinds of tools without VM modification.
  Knowledge: It is now possible for a client in a production environment to
insert (dynamically, with thread safety) an instrumentation probe that captures
and reports abstractly specified execution events. A probe in fully optimized
code imposes very low overhead until actually used to access (or modify)
execution state. Event capture has enabled construction of numerous GraalVM
services and tools that work for all implemented languages, either singly or in
combination. Instrumentation has also proved valuable for implementing some
traditionally tricky language features, as well as some GraalVM services such
as placing bounds on resources consumed by running programs.
  Grounding: Tools for debugging (via multiple clients), profiling, statement
counting, dynamic analysis, and others are now part of GraalVM or are in active
development. Third parties have also used Truffle Instrumentation for
innovative tool implementations.
  Importance: Experience with Truffle Instrumentation validates the notion that
addressing developer tools support as a forethought can change expectations
about the availability of practical, efficient tools for high-performance
languages. Tool development becomes a natural part of language implementation,
requiring little additional effort and offering the advantage of early and
continuous availability.

clean and curate data so that it can be systematically analyzed and reused. A
wealth of techniques for managing and curating data (and its provenance) have
been proposed, largely in the database community. In particular, a number of
influential papers have proposed collecting provenance information explaining
where a piece of data was copied from, or what other records were used to
derive it. Most of these techniques, however, exist only as research prototypes
and are not available in mainstream database systems. This means scientists
must either implement such techniques themselves or (all too often) go without.
  This is essentially a code reuse problem: provenance techniques currently
cannot be implemented reusably, only as ad hoc, usually unmaintained extensions
to standard databases. An alternative, relatively unexplored approach is to
support such techniques at a higher abstraction level, using metaprogramming or
reflection techniques. Can advanced programming techniques make it easier to
transfer provenance research results into practice?
  We build on a recent approach called language-integrated provenance, which
extends language-integrated query techniques with source-to-source query
translations that record provenance. In previous work, a proof of concept was
developed in a research programming language called Links, which supports
sophisticated Web and database programming. In this paper, we show how to adapt
this approach to work in Haskell building on top of the Database-Supported
Haskell (DSH) library.
  Even though it seemed clear in principle that Haskell's rich programming
features ought to be sufficient, implementing language-integrated provenance in
Haskell required overcoming a number of technical challenges due to
interactions between these capabilities. Our implementation serves as a proof
of concept showing how this combination of metaprogramming features can, for
the first time, make data provenance facilities available to programmers as a
library in a widely-used, general-purpose language.
  In our work we were successful in implementing forms of provenance known as
where-provenance and lineage. We have tested our implementation using a simple
database and query set and established that the resulting queries are executed
correctly on the database. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub.
  Our work makes provenance tracking available to users of DSH at little cost.
Although Haskell is not widely used for scientific database development, our
work suggests which languages features are necessary to support provenance as
library. We also highlight how combining Haskell's advanced type programming
features can lead to unexpected complications, which may motivate further
research into type system expressiveness.

spacetimes, which arise as solutions in a specific scalar-tensor theory
associated with braneworld gravity, are obtained using standard numerical
methods. Being solutions in a scalar-tensor theory, these wormholes can exist
with matter satisfying the Weak Energy Condition. If one posits that the
end-state of stellar-mass binary black hole mergers, of the type observed in
GW150914, can be these wormholes, then we show how their properties can be
measured from their distinct signatures in the gravitational waves emitted by
them as they settle down in the post-merger phase from an initially perturbed
state. We propose that their scalar quasinormal modes correspond to the
so-called breathing modes, which normally arise in gravitational wave solutions
in scalar-tensor theories. We show how the frequency and damping time of these
modes depend on the wormhole parameters, including its mass. We derive the mode
solutions and use them to determine how one can measure those parameters when
these wormholes are the endstate of binary black hole mergers. Specifically, we
find that if a breathing mode is observed in LIGO-like detectors with design
sensitivity, and has a maximum amplitude equal to that of the tensor mode that
was observed of GW150914, then for a range of values of the wormhole
parameters, we will be able to discern it from a black hole. If in future
observations we are able to confirm the existence of such wormholes, we would,
at one go, have some indirect evidence of a modified theory of gravity as well

and distance-dependent connectivity. The interpretation of the resulting stream
of multi-modal and multi-dimensional simulation data calls for integrating
interactive visualization steps into existing simulation-analysis workflows.
Here, we present a set of interactive visualization concepts called views for
the visual analysis of activity data in topological network models, and a
corresponding reference implementation VIOLA (VIsualization Of Layer Activity).
The software is a lightweight, open-source, web-based and platform-independent
application combining and adapting modern interactive visualization paradigms,
such as coordinated multiple views, for massively parallel neurophysiological
data. For a use-case demonstration we consider spiking activity data of a
two-population, layered point-neuron network model subject to a spatially
confined excitation originating from an external population. With the multiple
coordinated views, an explorative and qualitative assessment of the
spatiotemporal features of neuronal activity can be performed upfront of a
detailed quantitative data analysis of specific aspects of the data.
Furthermore, ongoing efforts including the European Human Brain Project aim at
providing online user portals for integrated model development, simulation,

one component. Browser-compatible, web-technology based solutions are therefore
required. Within this scope, with VIOLA we provide a first prototype.

processes including gene expression, chromosomal compaction, and viral

acids remains a topic of debate. To address this problem, we use
single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and custom particle-tracking algorithms
to investigate the impact of varying macromolecular crowding conditions on the
transport and conformational dynamics of large DNA molecules. Specifically, we
measure the mean-squared center-of-mass displacements, as well as the
conformational size, shape, and fluctuations, of individual 115 kbp DNA
molecules diffusing through various in vitro solutions of crowding polymers. We
determine the role of crowder structure and concentration, as well as ionic
conditions, on the diffusion and configurational dynamics of DNA. We find that
branched, compact crowders (10 kDa PEG, 420 kDa Ficoll) drive DNA to compact,
whereas linear, flexible crowders (10 kDa, 500 kDa dextran) cause DNA to
elongate. Interestingly, the extent to which DNA mobility is reduced by
increasing crowder concentrations appears largely insensitive to crowder
structure (branched vs linear), despite the highly different configurations DNA
assumes in each case. We also characterize the role of ionic conditions on
crowding-induced DNA dynamics. We show that both DNA diffusion and
conformational size exhibit an emergent non-monotonic dependence on salt
concentration that is not seen in the absence of crowders.

which scales approximately linearly with the numerical grid, and a global

gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA will enable strong-field tests of
general relativity with unprecedented precision, but at prohibitive
computational cost if existing statistical techniques are used. In one such
test that is currently employed for LIGO black-hole binary mergers, generic
deviations from relativity are represented by $N$ deformation parameters in a
generalised waveform model; the Bayesian evidence for each of its $2^N$
combinatorial submodels is then combined into a posterior odds ratio for
modified gravity over relativity in a null-hypothesis test. We adapt and apply
this test to a generalised model for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals constructed
on deformed black-hole spacetimes, and focus our investigation on how
computational efficiency can be increased through an evidence-free method of
model selection. This method is akin to the algorithm known as product-space
Markov chain Monte Carlo, but uses nested sampling and improved error estimates
from a rethreading technique. We perform benchmarking and robustness checks for
the method, and find order-of-magnitude computational gains over regular nested
sampling in the case of synthetic data generated from the null model.

emission during its strong optical-to-X-ray activity between July 2016 - July
2017. The daily $\gamma$-ray fluxes from \emph{Fermi}-LAT are consistent with
no variability. The strong optical-to-X-ray variability is accompanied by a
change in power-law spectral index of the X-ray spectrum from $< 2$ to $>2$,
with variations often associated with changes in optical polarization
properties. Cross-correlations between optical-to-X-ray emission during four
continuous segments show simultaneous optical-ultraviolet (UV) variations while
the X-ray and UV/optical are simultaneous only during the middle two segments.
In the first segment, the results suggest X-rays lag the optical/UV, while in
the last segment X-rays lead by $\sim$ 5-6 days. The last segment also shows a
systematic trend with variations appearing first at higher energies followed by
lower energy ones. The LAT spectrum before the VHE activity is similar to
preceding quiescent state spectrum while it hardens during VHE activity period
and is consistent with the extrapolated VHE spectrum during the latter.
Overall, the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during high
activity periods are a combination of a typical OJ 287 SED and an HBL SED, and
can be explained in a two-zone leptonic model, with the second zone located at
parsec scales, beyond the broad line region, being responsible for the HBL-like
spectrum. The change of polarization properties from systematic to chaotic and
back to systematic, before, during and after the VHE activity, suggest dynamic
roles for magnetic fields and turbulence.

and implementation. They allow formalizing the syntax of domain-specific or
general-purpose programming languages concisely and declaratively. However, the
natural and concise way of writing a context-free grammar is often ambiguous.
Therefore, grammar formalisms support extensions in the form of *declarative
disambiguation rules* to specify operator precedence and associativity, solving
ambiguities that are caused by the subset of the grammar that corresponds to
expressions.
  **Inquiry** Implementing support for declarative disambiguation within a
parser typically comes with one or more of the following limitations in
practice: a lack of parsing performance, or a lack of modularity (i.e.,
disallowing the composition of grammar fragments of potentially different
languages). The latter subject is generally addressed by scannerless
generalized parsers. We aim to equip scannerless generalized parsers with novel
disambiguation methods that are inherently performant, without compromising the
concerns of modularity and language composition.
  **Approach** In this paper, we present a novel low-overhead implementation
technique for disambiguating deep associativity and priority conflicts in
scannerless generalized parsers with lightweight data-dependency.
  **Knowledge** Ambiguities with respect to operator precedence and
associativity arise from combining the various operators of a language. While
*shallow conflicts* can be resolved efficiently by one-level tree patterns,
*deep conflicts* require more elaborate techniques, because they can occur
arbitrarily nested in a tree. Current state-of-the-art approaches to solving
deep priority conflicts come with a severe performance overhead.
  **Grounding** We evaluated our new approach against state-of-the-art
declarative disambiguation mechanisms. By parsing a corpus of popular
open-source repositories written in Java and OCaml, we found that our approach
yields speedups of up to 1.73x over a grammar rewriting technique when parsing
programs with deep priority conflicts--with a modest overhead of 1-2 % when
parsing programs without deep conflicts.
  **Importance** A recent empirical study shows that deep priority conflicts
are indeed wide-spread in real-world programs. The study shows that in a corpus
of popular OCaml projects on Github, up to 17 % of the source files contain
deep priority conflicts. However, there is no solution in the literature that
addresses efficient disambiguation of deep priority conflicts, with support for
modular and composable syntax definitions.

large number of triplet combinations associated with bulk periodic systems to
be critical to the fission process under such vibronically resonant conditions.
In addition, we present results including, in an approximate manner, the
effects of Peierls coupling, indicating that this factor can both enhance and

the entanglement properties of the model are studied for two types of
bipartition: one, where the subsystem A is completely contained in B; and the
second, where the boundary of the system is shared between A and B. In the
former configuration, the entanglement entropy is the same as for the periodic
boundary condition case, which means that the bulk is completely decoupled from
the boundary on distances larger than the correlation length. In the latter,
deviations from the torus configuration appear due to the edge states and lead
to an increase of the entropy. We then determine an effective theory for the
boundary of the system. In the case where we apply a small magnetic field as a
perturbation the degrees of freedom on the boundary acquire a dispersion
relation. The system can there be described by a Hamiltonian of the Ising type
with a generic spin-exchange term.

that optimal bounds on OPE coefficients lead to extremal solutions to crossing
arising from integrable field theories placed in large $AdS_2$. In the process,

the link between galaxy morphology and star-formation. To do so, it is

especially at high redshifts, where galaxies are poorly resolved. This work
presents a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions of the surface brightness

allowing an instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundreds Myr, we isolate 102
candidates out of a subsample of 6,680 galaxies classified as star-forming from
the UVJ criterion in the ZFOURGE catalogues. These galaxies are mostly located
in the lower part of the SFR-M$_*$ main sequence (MS) and extend up to a factor
100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between the passive and active
regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating that they are in a transition phase. We
show that the selected candidates have different physical properties compared
to galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower star-formation rates and
different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates show no preference
for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates, only 4 show signs of an AGN
activity (from X-ray luminosity or UV-IR SED fitting decomposition). This low
fraction of AGNs among the candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the
main driver of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty
cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover the past
position of these galaxies on the SFR-M$_*$ plane, before the downfall of their
star-formation and show that some of them were in the starburst region before

R_e = 2.2 kpc and little or no dark matter. The total mass of NGC1052-DF2 was
measured from the radial velocities of bright compact objects that are
associated with the galaxy. Here we analyze these objects using a combination
of HST imaging and Keck spectroscopy. Their average size is <r_h> = 6.2+-0.5 pc
and their average ellipticity is <{\epsilon}> = 0.18+-0.02. From a stacked Keck
spectrum we derive an age >9 Gyr and a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.35+-0.12.
Their properties are similar to {\omega} Centauri, the brightest and largest
globular cluster in the Milky Way, and our results demonstrate that the
luminosity function of metal-poor globular clusters is not universal. The
fraction of the total stellar mass that is in the globular cluster system is
similar to that in other UDGs, and consistent with ""failed galaxy"" scenarios
where star formation terminated shortly after the clusters were formed.
However, the galaxy is a factor of ~1000 removed from the relation between
globular cluster mass and total galaxy mass that has been found for other
galaxies, including other UDGs. We infer that a dark matter halo is not a
prerequisite for the formation of metal-poor globular cluster-like objects in
high redshift galaxies.

supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit an apparently asymmetric bluewards shift often
attributed to greater extinction by internal dust of redshifted radiation
emitted from the receding regions of the SN ejecta. The DAMOCLES Monte Carlo
line radiative transfer code models the extent and shape of these dust-affected
line profiles to determine the dust mass that has condensed, in addition to
other properties of the dusty ejecta. I present here the application of an
affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler (emcee) to
the DAMOCLES code in order to investigate the multi-dimensional parameter space
rigorously and characterise the posterior probability distribution. A
likelihood function is formulated that handles both Monte Carlo and
observational uncertainties. This Bayesian approach is applied to four
simulated line profiles in order to test the method and investigate its
efficacy. The majority of parameters can be tightly constrained using this
method, and a strong (predictable) dependence between the grain size and the
dust mass is quantified. The new approach is also applied to the H$\alpha$ line
and [O I]6300,6363 \AA\ doublet of SN 1987A at 714d post-outburst, re-examining
a previous 5-dimensional smooth model and also investigating a new, more
complex, 10-dimensional model that treats both features simultaneously. The
dust mass, dust grain size and a range of other parameters can be well
constrained using this technique, representing a significant improvement over
the previous manual approach.

absorption in galaxies, thereby serving as a diagnostic for feedback and
outflows. However, the interpretation of Mg II remains confusing, due to
resonant trapping and re-emission of the photons, analogous to Lyman Alpha.
Therefore, in this paper, we present new MMT Blue Channel Spectrograph
observations of Mg II for a sample of 10 Green Pea galaxies at z~0.2-0.3, where
Lyman Alpha was previously observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on
Hubble Space Telescope. With strong, (mostly) double-peaked Lyman Alpha
profiles, these galaxies allow us to observe Mg II in the limit of low H I
column density. We find strong Mg II emission and little-to-no absorption. We
use photoionization models to show that nebular Mg II from H II regions is
non-negligible, and the ratios of Mg II/[OIII] 5007 vs. [OIII] 5007/[OII] 3727
form a tight sequence. Using this relation, we predict intrinsic Mg II flux,
and show that Mg II escape fractions range from 0 to 0.9. We find that the Mg
II escape fraction correlates tightly with the Lyman Alpha escape fraction, and
the Mg II line profiles show evidence for broader and more redshifted emission
when the escape fractions are low. These trends are expected if the escape
fractions and velocity profiles of Lyman Alpha and Mg II are shaped by resonant
scattering in the same low column density gas. As a consequence of a close
relation with Lyman Alpha, Mg II may serve as a useful diagnostic in the epoch
of reionization, where Lyman Alpha and Lyman continuum photons are not easily
observed.

appear associated with transient phenomena like UV bursts or coronal jets.
Recent observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) show
that surges, although traditionally related to chromospheric lines, can exhibit
enhanced emission in Si IV with brighter spectral profiles than for the average
transition region (TR). In this paper, we explain why surges are natural sites
to show enhanced emissivity in TR lines. We performed 2.5D radiative-MHD
numerical experiments using the Bifrost code including the nonequilibrium
ionization of silicon and oxygen. A surge is obtained as a by-product of
magnetic flux emergence; the TR enveloping the emerged domain is strongly
affected by nonequilibrium effects: assuming statistical equilibrium would
produce an absence of Si IV and O IV ions in most of the region. Studying the
properties of the surge plasma emitting in the Si IV 1402.77 {\AA} and O IV
1401.16 {\AA} lines, we find that a) the timescales for the optically-thin
losses and heat conduction are very short, leading to departures from
statistical equilibrium, and b) the surge emits in Si IV more and has an
emissivity ratio of Si IV to O IV larger than a standard TR. Using synthetic
spectra, we conclude the importance of line-of-sight effects: given the
involved geometry of the surge, the line-of-sight can cut the emitting layer at
small angles and/or cross it multiple times, causing prominent, spatially
intermittent brightenings both in Si IV and O IV.

the ratio of stable [Ni II] to mainly radioactively-produced [Fe II] for most
SNe Ia in the sample is consistent with Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation
explosion models, as well as sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions that have
metallicity values above solar. The mean measured Ni/Fe abundance of our sample
is consistent with the solar value. The more highly ionised [Co III] emission
lines are found to be more centrally located in the ejecta and have broader
lines than the [Fe II] and [Ni II] features. Our analysis also strengthens
previous results that SNe Ia with higher Si II velocities at maximum light
preferentially display blueshifted [Fe II] 7155 \AA\ lines at late times. Our
combined results lead us to speculate that the majority of normal SN Ia
explosions produce ejecta distributions that deviate significantly from

such a merger can provide more fall-back materials and therefore a more massive

have bright X-ray flares, among which three flares from two bursts are probably
related to the central engine reactivity. We argue that these two bursts may

color excess ($E(B-V)_\star$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm h}$) of the
parent galaxy for $\sim 900$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\sim2$ divided
into ten subsamples. We calculate $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ using the stacked
observational relation between $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ and central Ly$\alpha$
luminosity by Momose et al. (2016), which we find agrees with the average trend
of VLT/MUSE-detected individual LAEs. We find that our LAEs have relatively
high $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ despite low $M_\star$ and $M_{\rm h}$, and that
$L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ remains almost unchanged with $M_\star$ and perhaps with
$M_{\rm h}$. These results are incompatible with the cold stream (cooling
radiation) scenario and the satellite-galaxy star-formation scenario, because
the former predicts fainter $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ and both predict steeper
$L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ vs. $M_\star$ slopes. We argue that LAHs are mainly
caused by Ly$\alpha$ photons escaping from the main body and then scattered in
the circum-galactic medium. This argument is supported by LAH observations of
H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs). When LAHs are taken into account, the Ly$\alpha$
escape fractions of our LAEs are about ten times higher than those of HAEs with
similar $M_\star$ or $E(B-V)_\star$, which may partly arise from lower HI gas
masses implied from lower $M_{\rm h}$ at fixed $M_\star$, or from another
Ly$\alpha$ source in the central part.

an important goal that has been studied extensively in recent years. It is now
known that for some basic learning problems, especially those involving
high-dimensional data, producing an accurate private model requires much more
data than learning without privacy. At the same time, in many applications it
is not necessary to expose the model itself. Instead users may be allowed to
query the prediction model on their inputs only through an appropriate
interface. Here we formulate the problem of ensuring privacy of individual
predictions and investigate the overheads required to achieve it in several
standard models of classification and regression.
  We first describe a simple baseline approach based on training several models
on disjoint subsets of data and using standard private aggregation techniques
to predict. We show that this approach has nearly optimal sample complexity for
(realizable) PAC learning of any class of Boolean functions. At the same time,
without strong assumptions on the data distribution, the aggregation step
introduces a substantial overhead. We demonstrate that this overhead can be
avoided for the well-studied class of thresholds on a line and for a number of
standard settings of convex regression. The analysis of our algorithm for
learning thresholds relies crucially on strong generalization guarantees that
we establish for all differentially private prediction algorithms.

degradation for inertial confinement fusion implosion experiments. It is based
on reconstruction of the implosion core with a combination of low- and mid-mode
asymmetries. This technique was applied to an ensemble of hydro-equivalent
deuterium-tritium implosions on OMEGA that achieved inferred hot-spot pressures
~56+/-7 Gbar [S. Regan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 025001 (2016)]. All the
experimental observables pertaining to the core could be reconstructed
simultaneously with the same combination of low and mid modes. This suggests
that in addition to low modes, that can cause a degradation of the stagnation
pressure, mid modes are present that reduce the size of the neuron and x-ray
producing volume. The systematic analysis shows that asymmetries can cause an
overestimation of the total areal density in these implosions. It is also found
that an improvement in implosion symmetry resulting from correction of either
the systematic mid or low modes would result in an increase of the hot-spot
pressure from 56 Gbar to ~80 Gbar and could produce a burning plasma when the
implosion core is extrapolated to an equivalent 1.9 MJ symmetric direct

understand the properties of quantum geometries in approaches to quantum
gravity. In loop quantum gravity and its spin foam description, it has not been
possible so far to calculate the spectral dimension of spacetime. As a first
step towards this goal, here we determine the spacetime spectral dimension in
the simplified spin foam model restricted to hypercuboids. Using Monte Carlo
methods we compute the spectral dimension for state sums over periodic spin
foam configurations on infinite lattices. For given periodicity, i.e. number of
degrees of freedom, we find a range of scale where an intermediate spectral
dimension between 0 and 4 can be found, continuously depending on the parameter
of the model. Under an assumption on the statistical behaviour of the Laplacian
we can explain these results analytically. This allows us to take the
thermodynamic limit of large periodicity and find a phase transition from a
regime of effectively 0-dimensional to 4-dimensional spacetime. At the point of
phase transition, dynamics of the model are scale invariant which can be seen
as restoration of diffeomorphism invariance of flat space. Considering the
spectral dimension as an order parameter for renormalization we find a
renormalization group flow to this point as well. Being the first instance of
an emergence of 4-dimensional spacetime in a spin foam model, the properties
responsible for this result seem to be rather generic. We thus expect similar
results for more general, less restricted spin foam models.

the solar system orbit their stars in much tighter orbits than the most
close-in planet in the solar system, Mercury. Short-period planets experienced
dynamical and evolutions histories distinct from their farther-out cousins, and
so it's not clear they are representative of all planets. These exoplanets
typically have radii between about 1 and 4 Earth radii, whereas the solar
system does not contain any planet in this radius range. And while the most
massive planets in the solar system occupy the icy regions beyond about 5 AU
from the sun, about 1% of sun-like stars have a Jupiter-mass planet near 0.05
AU, with just a few days of an orbital period. How did these short-period
planets get there? Did they form in-situ, or did they migrate towards their
contemporary orbits? If they migrated, what prevented them from falling into
their stars? Vice versa, could some of the remaining 99% of stars without such
a hot Jupiter show evidence of their past consumption of a close-in, massive
planet? The proximity between short-period planets and their host stars
naturally facilitates observational studies, and so short-period planets
dominate our observational constraints on planetary composition, internal

advantages of short-period planets for the theoretical and observational
investigations of exoplanets in general and of their host stars.

with an equatorial outflow deformed by the ram pressure, implying that the

the transient and asymptotic behavior of the annealing process respectively.

whether or not hidden sources are commonly present in two (or more) datasets.
Its well-appreciated merits include dimensionality reduction, clustering,
classification, feature selection, and data fusion. The standard CCA however,
does not exploit the geometry of the common sources, which may be available
from the given data or can be deduced from (cross-) correlations. In this
paper, this extra information provided by the common sources generating the
data is encoded in a graph, and is invoked as a graph regularizer. This leads
to a novel graph-regularized CCA approach, that is termed graph (g) CCA. The
novel gCCA accounts for the graph-induced knowledge of common sources, while
minimizing the distance between the wanted canonical variables. Tailored for
diverse practical settings where the number of data is smaller than the data
vector dimensions, the dual formulation of gCCA is also developed. One such
setting includes kernels that are incorporated to account for nonlinear data
dependencies. The resultant graph-kernel (gk) CCA is also obtained in closed
form. Finally, corroborating image classification tests over several real
datasets are presented to showcase the merits of the novel linear, dual, and
kernel approaches relative to competing alternatives.

the same multi-objective approach of maximizing damage done while minimizing

group of melee units. We extend this work to consider groups composed from two
types of units. Specifically, this paper uses evolutionary multi-objective
optimization to generate micro for one group composed from both ranged and
melee units versus another group of ranged and melee units. Our micro behavior
representation uses influence maps to represent enemy spatial information and
potential fields generated from distance, health, and weapons cool down to
guide unit movement. Experimental results indicate that our multi-objective
approach leads to a Pareto front of diverse high-quality micro encapsulating
multiple possible tactics. This range of micro provided by the Pareto front
enables a human or AI player to trade-off among short term tactics that better
suit the player's longer term strategy - for example, choosing to minimize
friendly unit damage at the cost of only lightly damaging the enemy versus
maximizing damage to the enemy units at the cost of increased damage to
friendly units. We believe that our results indicate the usefulness of
potential fields as a representation, and of evolutionary multi-objective

from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about
the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the
brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity
quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development
(e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has
motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces.
Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional
approach and evidence-based \emph{a priori} knowledge about specific signal
features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view.
Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage
new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical
characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of
the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's
perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning
algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory.
Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have
computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based
brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we
foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other
invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and
experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and
validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even
on having less number of training samples.

variability of the cortical geometry. This paper presents a novel approach for
learning and exploiting surface data directly across surface domains. Current
approaches rely on geometrical simplifications, such as spherical inflations, a
popular but costly process. For instance, the widely used FreeSurfer takes
about 3 hours to parcellate brain surfaces on a standard machine. Direct
learning of surface data via graph convolutions would provide a new family of
fast algorithms for processing brain surfaces. However, the current limitation
of existing state-of-the-art approaches is their inability to compare surface
data across different surface domains. Surface bases are indeed incompatible
between brain geometries. This paper leverages recent advances in spectral
graph matching to transfer surface data across aligned spectral domains. This
novel approach enables a direct learning of surface data across compatible
surface bases. It exploits spectral filters over intrinsic representations of

stratospheric hydrocarbons as a function of altitude, latitude, and season on

stratospheric circulation or other meridional transport processes, the
hydrocarbon abundances exhibit strong seasonal and meridional variations in the
upper stratosphere, but that these variations become increasingly damped with
depth due to increasing dynamical and chemical time scales. At high altitudes,
hydrocarbon mixing ratios are typically largest where the solar insolation is
the greatest, leading to strong hemispheric dichotomies between the
summer-to-fall hemisphere and winter-to-spring hemisphere. At mbar pressures
and deeper, slower chemistry and diffusion lead to latitude variations that
become more symmetric about the equator. On Uranus, the stagnant, poorly mixed
stratosphere confines methane and its photochemical products to higher
pressures, where chemistry and diffusion time scales remain large. Seasonal
variations in hydrocarbons are therefore predicted to be more muted on Uranus,
despite the planet's very large obliquity. Radiative-transfer simulations
demonstrate that latitude variations in hydrocarbons on both planets are
potentially observable with future JWST mid-infrared spectral imaging. Our
seasonal model predictions for Neptune compare well with retrieved C2H2 and
C2H6 abundances from spatially resolved ground-based observations (no such
observations currently exist for Uranus), suggesting that stratospheric
circulation -- which was not included in these models -- may have little
influence on the large-scale meridional hydrocarbon distributions on Neptune,
unlike the situation on Jupiter and Saturn.

vision-based methods rely on the ability of a drone's camera to capture

key parts toward an ultimate action to be taken. They are: image segregation
from the video streams of front camera, creating a robust and reliable image

gestures into actionable drone movement, such as takeoff, landing, hovering and
so forth. A set of five gestures are studied in this work. Haar feature-based
AdaBoost classifier is employed for gesture recognition. We also envisage
safety of the operator and drone's action calculating the distance based on
computer vision for this task. A series of experiments are conducted to measure
gesture recognition accuracies considering the major scene variabilities,
illumination, background, and distance. Classification accuracies show that

terms of scalar products of pairs of vectors (i.e., in terms of geometric
quantities such as lengths and angles). The whole formalism is entirely
independent of any particular choice of coordinate, and needs no use of the
somehow abstract formalism traditionally used when dealing with angular
momenta.
  The formalism is then applied to treat the problem of the irreducible tensor
operators of quantum spin systems. It enables to completely dispense with the
calculation and use of the Stevens operators, which can be quite complicated
even for moderate values of $\ell$. Explicit expressions for the calculation of
expectations values of physical observables are derived. They essentially
consist in combinations of scalar products of vector pairs. Together with the
coherent state representation of the quantum states of spin systems, this
provides a complete geometric, coordinate-free, description of the states,
dynamics and physical properties of these systems.

  Combinatorica",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $1$-factor in an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a collection of $\frac{n}{2}$
vertex-disjoint edges and a $1$-factorization of $G$ is a partition of its
edges into edge-disjoint $1$-factors. Clearly, a $1$-factorization of $G$
cannot exist unless $n$ is even and $G$ is regular (that is, all vertices are
of the same degree). The problem of finding $1$-factorizations in graphs goes
back to a paper of Kirkman in 1847 and has been extensively studied since then.
Deciding whether a graph has a $1$-factorization is usually a very difficult
question. For example, it took more than 60 years and an impressive tour de
force of Csaba, K\""uhn, Lo, Osthus and Treglown to prove an old conjecture of
Dirac from the 1950s, which says that every $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices
contains a $1$-factorization, provided that $n$ is even and $d\geq 2\lceil
\frac{n}{4}\rceil-1$. In this paper we address the natural question of
estimating $F(n,d)$, the number of $1$-factorizations in $d$-regular graphs on
an even number of vertices, provided that $d\geq \frac{n}{2}+\varepsilon n$.
Improving upon a recent result of Ferber and Jain, which itself improved upon a
result of Cameron from the 1970s, we show that $F(n,d)\geq
\left((1+o(1))\frac{d}{e^2}\right)^{nd/2}$, which is asymptotically best
possible.

matchings whose union is $E(G)$. A trivial necessary condition for $G$ to admit
a $1$-factorization is that $|V(G)|$ is even and $G$ is regular; the converse
is easily seen to be false. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding
$1$-factorizations of regular, pseudorandom graphs. Specifically, we prove that
an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ (that is, a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices
whose second largest eigenvalue in absolute value is at most $\lambda$) admits
a $1$-factorization provided that $n$ is even, $C_0\leq d\leq n-1$ (where $C_0$
is a universal constant), and $\lambda\leq d^{1-o(1)}$. In particular, since
(as is well known) a typical random $d$-regular graph $G_{n,d}$ is such a
graph, we obtain the existence of a $1$-factorization in a typical $G_{n,d}$
for all $C_0\leq d\leq n-1$, thereby extending to all possible values of $d$
results obtained by Janson, and independently by Molloy, Robalewska, Robinson,
and Wormald for fixed $d$. Moreover, we also obtain a lower bound for the
number of distinct $1$-factorizations of such graphs $G$ which is off by a
factor of $2$ in the base of the exponent from the known upper bound. This
lower bound is better by a factor of $2^{nd/2}$ than the previously best known
lower bounds, even in the simplest case where $G$ is the complete graph. Our
proofs are probabilistic and can be easily turned into polynomial time
(randomized) algorithms.

is here analyzed in a case where the free evolution is frustrated by the
presence of hard-wall-type boundaries (beyond the initial localization region).
The phenomenon is investigated in the context of a nonrelativistic, spinless
particle with mass m confined in a one-dimensional box, combining the spectral
decomposition of the initially localized wave function (treated as a coherent
superposition of energy eigenfunctions) with a dynamical analysis based on the
hydrodynamic or Bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics. Actually, such a
decomposition has been used to devise a simple and efficient analytical
algorithm that simplifies the computation of velocity fields (flows) and
trajectories. As it is shown, the development of space-time patters inside the
cavity depends on three key elements: the shape of the initial wave function,
the mass of the particle considered, and the relative extension of the initial
state with respect to the total length spanned by the cavity. From the spectral
decomposition it is possible to identify how each one of these elements
contribute to the localized matter wave and its evolution; the Bohmian
analysis, on the other hand, reveals aspects connected to the diffraction
dynamics and the subsequent appearance of interference traits, particularly
recurrences and full revivals of the initial state, which constitute the source
of the characteristic symmetries displayed by these patterns. It is also found
that, because of the presence of confining boundaries, even in cases of
increasingly large box lengths, no Fraunhofer-like diffraction features can be
observed, as happens when the same wave evolves in free space. Although the
analysis here is applied to matter waves, its methodology and conclusions are
also applicable to confined modes of electromagnetic radiation (optical
fibers).

coupled to a time-dependent chemical network for use in 3D

irradiated with X-rays of different intensity, and the chemical and thermal

cloud an X-ray flux $<0.01$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ allows the cloud to remain
molecular, whereas most of the CO and H$_2$ are destroyed for a flux of $>1$
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The effects of an X-ray flare, which suddenly increases
the X-ray flux by $10^5 \times$ are then studied. A cloud exposed to a bright
flare has 99% of its CO destroyed in 10-20 years, whereas it takes $>10^3$
years for 99% of the H$_2$ to be destroyed. CO is primarily destroyed by
locally generated far-UV emission from collisions between non-thermal electrons

abundance is already very small. After the flare is over, CO re-forms and
approaches its equilibrium abundance after $10^3-10^5$ years. This implies that
molecular clouds close to Sgr A$^*$ in the Galactic Centre may still be out of

other hosts in a certain time period. The number of hosts contacting with a
super point is called as its cardinality. Cardinality estimating plays
important roles in network management and security. All of existing works focus
on how to estimate super point's cardinality under discrete time window. But
discrete time window causes great delay and the accuracy of estimating result
is subject to the starting of the window. sliding time window, moving
forwarding a small slice every time, offers a more accuracy and timely scale to
monitor super point's cardinality. On the other hand, super point's cardinality
estimating under sliding time window is more difficult because it requires an
algorithm to record the cardinality incrementally and report them immediately
at the end of the sliding duration. This paper firstly solves this problem by
devising a sliding time window available algorithm SRLA. SRLA records hosts
cardinality by a novel structure which could be updated incrementally. In order
to reduce the cardinality estimating time at the end of every sliding time
window, SRLA generates a super point candidate list while scanning packets and
calculates the cardinality of hosts in the candidate list only. It also has the
ability to run parallel to deal with high speed network in line speed. This
paper gives the way to deploy SRLA on a common GPU. Experiments on real world
traffics which have 40 GB/s bandwidth show that SRLA successfully estimates
super point's cardinality within 100 milliseconds under sliding time window
when running on a low cost Nvidia GPU, GTX650 with 1 GB memory. The estimating
time of SRLA is much smaller than that of other algorithms which consumes more
than 2000 milliseconds under discrete time window.

describe the dynamics among a set of neurons that interact with each other by
firing instantaneous signals, a.k.a., spikes. Interestingly, a recent advance
in neuroscience [Barrett-Den\`eve-Machens, NIPS 2013] showed that the neurons'
firing rate, i.e., the average number of spikes fired per unit of time, can be
characterized by the optimal solution of a quadratic program defined by the
parameters of the dynamics. This indicated that SNN potentially has the
computational power to solve non-trivial quadratic programs. However, the
results were justified empirically without rigorous analysis.
  We put this into the context of natural algorithms and aim to investigate the
algorithmic power of SNN. Especially, we emphasize on giving rigorous
asymptotic analysis on the performance of SNN in solving optimization problems.
To enforce a theoretical study, we first identify a simplified SNN model that
is tractable for analysis. Next, we confirm the empirical observation in the
work of Barrett et al. by giving an upper bound on the convergence rate of SNN
in solving the quadratic program. Further, we observe that in the case where
there are infinitely many optimal solutions, SNN tends to converge to the one
with smaller l1 norm. We give an affirmative answer to our finding by showing
that SNN can solve the l1 minimization problem under some regular conditions.
  Our main technical insight is a dual view of the SNN dynamics, under which
SNN can be viewed as a new natural primal-dual algorithm for the l1
minimization problem. We believe that the dual view is of independent interest
and may potentially find interesting interpretation in neuroscience.

the CEV model has a marked advantage in capturing basic empirical regularities

fact, the performance of the CEV model is comparable to most stochastic
volatility models, but it is considerable easier to implement and calibrate.
Nevertheless, the standard CEV model solution, using the non-central chi-square
approach, still presents high computational times, specially when: i) the
maturity is small, ii) the volatility is low, or iii) the elasticity of the
variance tends to zero. In this paper, a new numerical method for computing the

pixel-by-pixel basis, a $\beta_\mathrm{c}$ map shows values ranging from
$\sim1$ to $\sim2$ over the whole galaxy. In particular, high
$\beta_\mathrm{c}$ values of $\sim2$ are only observed in the regions indicated
by the color-color diagram. Since the average cold dust temperature in NGC 1569
is $\sim30$ K, $\beta_\mathrm{c}<2.0$ in the far-IR and sub-mm region

$\beta_\mathrm{c}=2.0$ suggests that from crystal grains. Given that the
enhanced $\beta_\mathrm{c}$ regions are spatially confined by the HI ridge that

is associated with the periodic shedding of a toroidal vortex, which is formed
under gravity-induced shearing at the flames. Moreover, numerous experimental
investigations have reported the scaling relation, $f \propto D^{-1/2}$, where
$f$ is the flickering frequency and $D$ is the diameter of the fuel inlet.
However, the connection between the toroidal vortex mechanism and the scaling
relation has not been clearly understood. The current study theoretically
revisits this problem from the perspective of vortex dynamics. The theory
incorporates a recent finding in the vortex dynamics community: the detachment
of a continuously growing vortex ring is inevitable and can be dictated by a
universal constant that is essentially a non-dimensional circulation of the
vortex. By calculating the total circulation of the toroidal vortex and
applying the vortex ring detachment criterion, we mathematically established
the connection between the lifetime of a toroidal vortex and the flickering of
a buoyant diffusion flame, resulting in a general flickering frequency
formulation, which is validated by comparing with existing experimental data of
pool and jet diffusion flames.

worldwide popularity recently. In such games, players compete in teams against
each other by controlling selected game avatars, each of which is designed with
different strengths and weaknesses. Intuitively, putting together game avatars
that complement each other (synergy) and suppress those of opponents
(opposition) would result in a stronger team. In-depth understanding of synergy
and opposition relationships among game avatars benefits player in making
decisions in game avatar drafting and gaining better prediction of match
events. However, due to intricate design and complex interactions between game
avatars, thorough understanding of their relationships is not a trivial task.
  In this paper, we propose a latent variable model, namely Game Avatar
Embedding (GAE), to learn avatars' numerical representations which encode
synergy and opposition relationships between pairs of avatars. The merits of
our model are twofold: (1) the captured synergy and opposition relationships
are sensible to experienced human players' perception; (2) the learned
numerical representations of game avatars allow many important downstream
tasks, such as similar avatar search, match outcome prediction, and avatar pick
recommender. To our best knowledge, no previous model is able to simultaneously
support both features. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real
match data from three commercial MOBA games illustrate the benefits of our
model.

show that phonon blockade could be achieved in a system of two weakly nonlinear
mechanical resonators coupled by a Coulomb interaction. The optimal blockade
arises as a result of the destructive quantum interference between paths
leading to two-phonon excitation. It is observed that, in comparison to a
single drive applied on one mechanical resonator, driving both the resonators
can be beneficial in many aspects; such as, in terms of the temperature
sensitivity of phonon blockade and also with regard to the tunability, by
controlling the amplitude and the phase of the second drive externally. We also
show that via a radiation pressure induced coupling in an optomechanical

the normalized flickering frequency versus a characteristic Reynolds number,
which accounts for the viscous effect on vorticity diffusion between the two

of classifiers which have otherwise good performance on undisturbed images.
These examples are generated by adding non-random noise to the testing samples
in order to make classifier misclassify the given data. Adversarial attacks use
these intentionally generated examples and they pose a security risk to the
machine learning based systems. To be immune to such attacks, it is desirable
to have a pre-processing mechanism which removes these effects causing
misclassification while keeping the content of the image. JPEG and JPEG2000 are
well-known image compression techniques which suppress the high-frequency
content taking the human visual system into account. JPEG has been also shown
to be an effective method for reducing adversarial noise. In this paper, we
propose applying JPEG2000 compression as an alternative and systematically
compare the classification performance of adversarial images compressed using
JPEG and JPEG2000 at different target PSNR values and maximum compression
levels. Our experiments show that JPEG2000 is more effective in reducing

different orders we have generated Bessel beams of varying range at different
positions away from the axicon. The presence of dark core at the center of the
HGBs removes the effect of imperfection in the axicon tip. As a result, the
entire power of the input beam is transformed into zero-order Bessel beam
without any on-axis intensity modulation. We observe the decrease in range and
increase in peak power of the zero-order Bessel beam with the order of HGBs.
Controlling the superposition of the HGBs of different orders to the axicon we
have demonstrated the increase in the range of the Bessel beam. The current
technique can also produce Bessel beams of different intensity distribution
including single peak or multiple peak Bessel beams. Using single-pass second
harmonic generation in nonlinear crystals of different lengths we have further
verified the increase of peak power of the Bessel beam with the order of the
HGBs and also the increase in the range of the Bessel beam due to the
superposed HGBs. The generic experimental scheme can be used at different

a good overlap with the anti-Pfaffian state and with the ground state obtained
by exact diagonalization, using the second Landau level Coulomb interaction
pseudopotentials for an ordinary semiconductor such as GaAs. By calculating the

sample size as an additional source of misleading inference about the slope of
the control rate regression. Likelihood procedures relying on first-order
approximations are shown to be substantially inaccurate, especially when
dealing with increasing heterogeneity and correlated measurement errors. We
suggest to address the problem by relying on higher-order asymptotics. In

accuracy of the approximation of the signed profile log-likelihood ratio
statistic to the standard normal distribution. The proposal is shown to provide
much more accurate results than standard likelihood solutions, with no
appreciable computational effort. The advantages of Skovgaard's statistic in
control rate regression are shown in a series of simulation experiments and
illustrated in a real data example. R code for applying first- and second-order

the case $s\geq0$, we further ask how much regularity we can expect on this

$s<0$, which shows that the smoothing effect cannot occur in this
time-dependent setting and the dispersion in the Schr\""odinger flow
$e^{it\Delta}$ is not strong enough to have the effect. This naturally leads us
to consider the possibility of having the effect at best in higher-order
versions of this estimate with $e^{-it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}}$ ($\gamma>2$) whose
dispersion is more strong. We do obtain a smoothing effect exactly for these
higher-order versions. In fact, we will obtain the estimates where
$\gamma\geq1$ in a unified manner and also their corresponding inhomogeneous
estimates to give applications to the global well-posedness for Schr\""odinger

testing performance; and (2) we systematically cast DFT as reachability
checking in software model checking (SMC) to complement SE, yielding practical
DFT that combines the two techniques' strengths. We implemented our framework

of non-Hermitian resonant photonic systems operating near an exceptional point

EP can exhibit a non-Lorentzian frequency response, whose line shape and
intensity strongly depend on the modal decay rate and coupling parameters for
the input waves, unlike a normal Lorentzian response around a single resonance.
In particular, it is shown that the peak intensity of the frequency response is
inversely proportional to the fourth power of the modal decay rate and can be
significantly enhanced with the aid of optical gain. The theoretical results
are numerically verified by a full wave simulation of a microring cavity with
gain. In addition, the effects of the nonlinear gain saturation and spontaneous

may be useful for designing and controlling the excitation of eigenmodes by

the physical state and energy balance of cool matter in space, thus enabling
the detailed study of the various processes that govern the formation and early
evolution of stars and planetary systems in galaxies over cosmic time. Previous
infrared missions, from IRAS to Herschel, have revealed a great deal about the
obscured Universe, but sensitivity has been limited because up to now it has
not been possible to fly a telescope that is both large and cold.
  SPICA is a mission concept aimed at taking the next step in mid- and
far-infrared observational capability by combining a large and cold telescope
with instruments employing state-of-the-art ultra-sensitive detectors. The
mission concept foresees a 2.5-meter diameter telescope cooled to below 8 K.
With cooling provided by mechanical coolers instead of depending on a limited
cryogen supply, the mission lifetime can extend significantly beyond the
required three years.
  SPICA offers instrumentation with spectral resolving powers ranging from R
~50 through 11000 in the 17-230 $\mu$m domain as well as R~28.000 spectroscopy
between 12 and 18 $\mu$m. Additionally SPICA will provide efficient 30-37
$\mu$m broad band mapping, and polarimetric imaging in the 100-350 $\mu$m
range. SPICA will provide unprecedented spectroscopic sensitivity of ~5 x
$10^{-20}$ W/m$^2$ (5$\sigma$/1hr) - at least two orders of magnitude
improvement over what has been attained to date.
  With this exceptional leap in performance, new domains in infrared astronomy
will become accessible, allowing us, for example, to unravel definitively
galaxy evolution and metal production over cosmic time, to study dust formation
and evolution from very early epochs onwards, and to trace the formation
history of planetary systems.

high-dimensional regressions. In many practical situations, it is natural to
assign group membership to each predictor. Examples include that genetic
variants can be grouped at the gene level and a covariate from different tasks
naturally forms a group. Thus, it is of interest to select important groups as
well as important members from those groups. The existing Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods are often computationally intensive and not scalable to
large data sets. To address this problem, we consider variational inference for
bi-level variable selection (BIVAS). In contrast to the commonly used
mean-field approximation, we propose a hierarchical factorization to
approximate the posterior distribution, by utilizing the structure of bi-level
variable selection. Moreover, we develop a computationally efficient and fully
parallelizable algorithm based on this variational approximation. We further
extend the developed method to model data sets from multi-task learning. The
comprehensive numerical results from both simulation studies and real data
analysis demonstrate the advantages of BIVAS for variable selection, parameter
estimation and computational efficiency over existing methods. The method is
implemented in R package `bivas' available at https://github.com/mxcai/bivas.

kinetics of biomedical grade zirconia. The critical influence of polishing has
been systematically investigated by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy
and X-ray diffraction. The stress state around polishing scratches gives rise
to preferential transformation in the zone of the induced scratches and
consequently to accelerated ageing. The influence of residual stresses is
analyzed semi-quantitatively by preparing samples with various surface finish,
thus with various stress states. Rough polishing produces a compressive surface
stress layer beneficial for the ageing resistance, while smooth polishing
produces preferential transformation nucleation around scratches. When a
thermal treatment of 2 h at 1200 {\deg}C is applied to relax the residual
stresses, all the surfaces states exhibit the same sensitivity to ageing. These
results demonstrate that roughness alone cannot be used for ensuring a
long-term stability. The variation of ageing sensitivity is indeed related
indirectly to the surface roughness via the induced surface stress state. The
current ISO standards are not able to take these effects into account. Indeed,
great variations in ageing kinetics were observed for samples with different
surface states, although all well below the ISO requirements.

studied NLS1 galaxy in X-rays to date. We apply standard time- and
Fourier-domain in order to understand the underlying variability process. The
source flux is not distributed lognormally, as would be expected for accreting
sources. The first non-linear rms-flux relation for any accreting source in any
waveband is found, with $\mathrm{rms} \propto \mathrm{flux}^{2/3}$. The light
curves exhibit significant strong non-stationarity, in addition to that caused
by the rms-flux relation, and are fractionally more variable at lower source
flux. The power spectrum is estimated down to $\sim 10^{-7}$ Hz and consists of
multiple peaked components: a low-frequency break at $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz, with
slope $\alpha < 1$ down to low frequencies; an additional component breaking at
$\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz. Using the high-frequency break we estimate the black hole
mass $M_\mathrm{BH} = [0.5-2] \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}$, and mass accretion rate
in Eddington units, $\dot m_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim 1$. The non-stationarity is
manifest in the PSD with the normalisation of the peaked components increasing
with decreasing source flux, as well as the low-frequency peak moving to higher
frequencies. We also detect a narrow coherent feature in the soft band PSD at
$0.7$ mHz, modelled with a Lorentzian the feature has $Q \sim 8$ and an
$\mathrm{rms} \sim 3$ %. We discuss the implication of these results for

universe are barred, some galaxies remain un-barred, occupying the upper half
of the Hubble tuning fork diagram. Numerical simulations almost always produce
bars spontaneously, so it remains a challenge to understand how galaxies
sometimes prevent bars from forming. Using a set of collisionless simulations,
we first reproduce the common result that cold stellar disks surrounding a
classical bulge become strongly unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations,
leading to the rapid formation of spiral structure and bars. However, our
analyses show that galaxy models with compact classical bulges (whose average
density is greater than or comparable to the disk density calculated within
bulge half-mass radii) are able to prevent bar formation for at least 4 Gyr
even when the stellar disk is maximal and having low Toomre Q. Such bar
prevention is the result of several factors such as (a) a small inner Lindblad
resonance with a high angular rate, which contaminates an incipient bar with
$x_2$ orbits, (b) rapid loss of angular momentum accompanied by a rapid heating
in the center from initially strong bar and spiral instabilities in a low-Q
disk, in other words, a rapid initial rise to a value larger than $\sim5$ of
the ratio of the random energy to the rotational energy in the central region
of the galaxy.

of the jet proper motion. Based on two-epoch observations, we constrained its
radio jet proper motion using the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
technique. The observations were conducted with the European VLBI Network (EVN)
at 5 GHz on 1999 November 26 and 2015 October 6. We imaged the central 10-pc
scale radio jet emission and modeled its brightness distribution. By
identifying a jet component at both epochs separated by 15.86 yr, a proper
motion of mu=0.035 +- 0.023 mas/yr is found. It corresponds to an apparent
superluminal speed of beta_a=4.1 +- 2.7 c . Relativistic beaming at both epochs
suggests that the jet viewing angle with respect to the line of sight is
smaller than 20 deg, with a minimum bulk Lorentz factor Gamma=4.3. The small
value of the proper motion is in good agreement with the expectations from the
cosmological interpretation of the redshift and the current cosmological model.
Additionally we analyzed archival Very Large Array observations of J2143-0419
and found indication of a bent jet extending to ~30 kpc.

watershed moment in multi-messenger astronomy. However, gravitational waves
from GW170817 have only been observed prior to the BNS merger, but
electromagnetic observations all follow the merger event. While post-merger
gravitational wave signal in general relativity is too faint (given current
detector sensitivities), here we present the first tentative detection of
post-merger gravitational wave ""echoes"" from a highly spinning ""black hole""
remnant. The echoes may be expected in different models of quantum black holes
that replace event horizons by exotic Planck-scale structure and tentative
evidence for them has been found in binary black hole merger events. The fact
that the echo frequency is suppressed by $\log M$ (in Planck units) puts it
squarely in the LIGO sensitivity window, allowing us to build an optimal
model-agnostic search strategy via cross-correlating the two detectors in
frequency/time. We find a tentative detection of echoes at $f_{\rm echo} \simeq
72$ Hz, around 1.0 sec after the BNS merger, consistent with a 2.6-2.7
$M_\odot$ ""black hole"" remnant with dimensionless spin $0.84-0.87$. Accounting
for all the ""look-elsewhere"" effects, we find a significance of $4.2 \sigma$,
or a false alarm probability of $1.6\times 10^{-5}$, i.e. a similar
cross-correlation within the expected frequency/time window after the merger
cannot be found more than 4 times in 3 days. If confirmed, this finding will
have significant consequences for both physics of quantum black holes and
astrophysics of binary neutron star mergers [Note added: This result is

instabilities initiated in Part I of this series. In this work, we primarily
focus on quantifying the impact of non-local mixing, which is not taken into
account in Zahn's mixing model \citep{Zahn92}. We present the results of direct
numerical simulations in a new model setup designed to contain coexisting
laminar and turbulent shear layers. As in Part I, we use the Low P\'eclet
Number approximation of \citet{Lign1999} to model the evolution of the
perturbations. Our main findings are twofold. First, turbulence is not
necessarily generated whenever Zahn's nonlinear criterion \citep{Zahn1974}
$J{\rm Pr} < (J{\rm Pr})_c$ is satisfied, where $J=N^2/S^2$ is the local
gradient Richardson number, ${\rm Pr} = \nu/ \kappa_T$ is the Prandtl number,
and $(J{\rm Pr})_c \simeq 0.007$. We have demonstrated that the presence or
absence of turbulent mixing in this limit hysteretically depends on the history
of the shear layer. Second, Zahn's nonlinear instability criterion only
approximately locates the edge of the turbulent layer, and mixing beyond the
region where $J{\rm Pr} < (J{\rm Pr})_c$ can also take place in a manner
analogous to convective overshoot. We found that the turbulent kinetic energy
decays roughly exponentially beyond the edge of the shear-unstable region, on a
lengthscale $\delta$ that is directly proportional to the scale of the
turbulent eddies, which are themselves of the order of the Zahn scale (see Part
I). Our results suggest that mixing by diffusive shear instabilities should be
modeled with more care than is currently standard in stellar evolution codes.

the magnetic resonance spectra of multispin systems since the dimension of the
Hilbert space of such systems grows exponentially with the number of spins -- a
problem commonly referred to as the ""curse of dimensionality"". In this paper,
we propose two mathematical instruments which, when harmoniously combined,
could greatly help surmount to a fair degree and in a systematic manner the
curse of dimensionality. These are: 1) the Holstein-Primakoff bosons and 2)
what we have termed the ""index compression maps"". These two allow a bijective
mapping of (multi)spin states to integers. Their combination leads to the block
diagonalization of the multispin Hamiltonian, thus a computationally exact way
of diagonalizing the latter but which also reduces significantly the
computational cost. We also show that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the
Liouvillian operator can be easily determined once those of the related
multispin Hamiltonian are known. Interestingly, the method also enables an
analytical characterization of the multispin Hilbert space -- a feat hardly
attainable with other approaches.
  We illustrate the method here by showing how a general static isotropic
multispin Hamiltonian could be exactly diagonalized with very less
computational cost. Nonetheless, we emphasize that the method could be applied
to study numerous quantum systems defined on finite Hilbert spaces and embodied
with at most pairwise interactions.

locate the target. The time to locate the target is $T_a=\inf\{t\ge0:
X(t)=a\}$. The searcher has a given constant diffusion rate $D>0$, but its
drift $b$ can be set by the search designer from a natural admissible class
$\mathcal{D}_\mu$ of drifts. Thus, the diffusive searcher is a Markov process
generated by the operator $L=\frac D2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+b(x)\frac d{dx}$. %
equivalently, $X(\cdot)$ satisfies the stochastic differential equation

semantic segmentation in the wild. To alleviate this issue, we present a novel
framework that generates segmentation labels of images given their image-level
class labels. In this weakly supervised setting, trained models have been known
to segment local discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our
solution is to propagate such local responses to nearby areas which belong to
the same semantic entity. To this end, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
called AffinityNet that predicts semantic affinity between a pair of adjacent
image coordinates. The semantic propagation is then realized by random walk
with the affinities predicted by AffinityNet. More importantly, the supervision
employed to train AffinityNet is given by the initial discriminative part
segmentation, which is incomplete as a segmentation annotation but sufficient
for learning semantic affinities within small image areas. Thus the entire
framework relies only on image-level class labels and does not require any
extra data or annotations. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, a DNN learned with
segmentation labels generated by our method outperforms previous models trained
with the same level of supervision, and is even as competitive as those relying
on stronger supervision.

due to an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling induced by ISB, the strength of

This problem is modelled as the estimation of a set of quadrics given 2D conics

recently proposed, the resulting quadrics can be inaccurate or even be non
valid ellipsoids in presence of noisy and inaccurate detections. This effect is
especially important in case of small baselines, resulting in dramatic
failures. To cope with this problem, we propose a set of linear constraints by
matching the centres of the reprojected quadrics with the centres of the
observed conics. These constraints can be solved with a linear system thus
providing a more computationally efficient solution with respect to a
non-linear alternative. Experiments on real data show that the proposed
approach improves significantly the accuracy and the validity of the

creating the best conditions for developing these experiments, using a
satellite with a 6 $m^3$ test chamber. During the mission 28 experiments are
performed using different dust compositions, sizes and shapes, to better
understand under which conditions dust grains stick and aggregate. Each
experiment should last up to one month, with relative collision velocities of
up to 5 mm/s, and initial dust sizes between 1 $\mu$m and 1 mm. At least $10^6$
collisions per experiment should be recorded, to provide statistically
significant results. Based on the scientific objectives and requirements, a
preliminary analysis of the payload instrumentation is performed. From that a
conceptual mission and spacecraft design is developed, together with a first

defects are active sites for water dissociation. Furthermore, we reveal that
water dissociation is an exothermic reaction, which demonstrates that the

a safety cost implied by a partial block verification. In this work, we enable
low-resource devices to fully verify subchains of blocks without having to pay
the onerous price of a full chain download and verification; a few additional
MiB of bandwidth suffice. To do so, we propose the design of diet nodes that
can securely query full nodes for shards of the UTXO set, which is needed to
perform full block verification and can otherwise only be built by sequentially
parsing the chain.

interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the magnetosphere that led to transient
weakening of Earth's magnetic shield. This burst had occurred during a G4-class

the expected order of accuracy is achieved for three benchmark problems,

the new model has between 2 and 10 times lower error for a given grid size.
Simulations of a two-dimensional air-SF_6 Richtmyer-Meshkov instability
demonstrate that the new model converges to the solution with four times fewer
points in each direction when compared to the mass fraction model in an
identical numerical framework. This represents an ~40 times lower computational
cost for an equivalent error in two-dimensional computations. The proposed
model is thus very suitable for Direct Numerical Simulation and Large Eddy

transfer stations when the distance between two separate liquid metal droplets

advantage of the current droplet circuit lies in that it allows parallel
electron transport, high flexibility, self-healing, regulativity and
multi-point connectivity, without needing to worry about circuit break. This
would extend the category of classical electrical circuits into the newly

the geometry of eclipsing binary systems in Kepler K2 campaigns 1, 2 and 3. The

eclipsing binary systems have been identified and 40 of these are characterised

identify two eclipsing binaries containing red giant stars, including one
bright system with total eclipses that is ideal for detailed follow-up

the forces created by surface-produced gas bubbles inside the asymmetric body
of a catalytic swimmer (referred to in the literature as microrocket). Gas
bubbles nucleate and grow within the catalytic swimmer and migrate toward one
of its opening under the effect of asymmetric geometric confinement, thus
generating a net hydrodynamic force which propels the device. In this paper we
use numerical simulations to develop a joint chemical (diffusive) and
hydrodynamic (Stokes) analysis of the bubble growth within a conical catalytic
microrocket and of the associated bubble and microrocket motion. Our
computational model allows us to solve for the bubble dynamics over one full
bubble cycle ranging from its nucleation to its exiting the conical rocket and
therefore to identify the propulsion characteristics as function of all design
parameters, including geometry and chemical activity of the motor, surface
tension phenomena, and all physicochemical constants. Our results suggest that
hydrodynamics and chemistry partially decouple in the motion of the bubbles,
with hydrodynamics determining the distance travelled by the microrocket over
each cycle while chemistry setting the bubble ejection frequency. Our numerical
model finally allows us to identify an optimal microrocket shape and size for
which the swimming velocity (distance travelled per cycle duration) is
maximized.

  S-Functional Calculus and Spectral Operators",,,,,"math.SP math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two themes drive this article: identifying the structure necessary to
formulate quaternionic operator theory and revealing the relation between
complex and quaternionic operator theory.
  The theory of quaternionic right linear operators is usually formulated
assuming the existenc of both a right- and a left-multiplication on the Banach
space $V$, as the space of bounded operators on $V$ is otherwise not a
quaternionic linear space. A right linear operator is however only associated
with the right-multiplication and in certain settings, e.g. on Hilbert spaces,
the left-multiplication is not defined a priori but must be chosen randomly.
Spectral properties of an operator should hence be independent of this left
multiplication.
  We show that results derived from functional calculi for intrinsic slice
functions can be formulated without the assumption of a left multiplication. We
develop the S-functional calculus in this setting and a new approach to
spectral integration. This approach has a clear interpretation in terms of the
right linear structure on the space and allows to formulate the spectral
theorem without using any randomly chosen structure. Our techniques only apply
to intrinsic slice functions, but only these functions are compatible with the
basic intuition of a functional calculus that $f(T)$ should be defined by
letting $f$ act on the spectral values of $T$.
  Using these tools, we develop a theory of quaternionic spectral operators. In
particular, we show the existence of a canonical decomposition of such operator
and discuss its behavior under the S-functional calculus.
  Finally, we show a relation with complex operator theory: if we embed the
complex numbers into the quaternions, then complex and quaternionic operator
theory are consistent. The symmetry of intrinsic slice functions guarantees
that this compatibility is true for any imbedding of the complex numbers.

also propose extending the capability of TTS to handle unseen speakers by
implementing one-shot speaker adaptation. This enables TTS to mimic voice
characteristics from one speaker to another with only a one-shot speaker

Normally, there are two types of observables associated with the production of
isolated-photon plus a jet, namely, the azimuthal angular correlation and the
transverse momentum imbalance. To understand both observables in the full
kinematical region, we need to employ the perturbative QCD calculation, which
takes into account the hard splitting of partons, together with the Sudakov
resummation formalism, which resums soft gluon splittings. Furthermore, by
introducing energy-loss into the system, we calculate the enhancement of the
momentum imbalance distribution for $AA$ as compared to $pp$ collisions and
make predictions for future unfolded experimental data. In addition, in order
to extract the jet transport coefficient more precisely in our numerical
calculation, we also distinguish quark jets from gluon jets, since they
interact with quark gluon plasma with different strengths. This work provides a
reliable theoretical tool for the calculation of the gamma-jet correlation,
which can lead us to a more precise extraction of the jet transport coefficient

method for estimating causal effects of time-dependent immunological biomarkers
on toxicity, death and progression in patients with metastatic melanoma. The
simulation study showed that the completed partially directed acyclic graphs
(CPDAGs) obtained using COPC-algorithm were structurally closer to the true
CPDAG than CPDAGs obtained using PC-algorithm. Also, causal effects were more
accurate when they were estimated based on CPDAGs obtained using
COPC-algorithm. Moreover, CPDAGs obtained by COPC-algorithm allowed removing
non-chronologic arrows with a variable measured at a time t pointing to a
variable measured at a time t' where t'< t. Bidirected edges were less present
in CPDAGs obtained with the COPC-algorithm, supporting the fact that there was
less variability in causal effects estimated from these CPDAGs. The
COPC-algorithm provided CPDAGs that keep the chronological structure present in
the data, thus allowed to estimate lower bounds of the causal effect of
time-dependent biomarkers.

the tight-binding Hamiltonian combining with the nonequilibrium Green's
function method. They are strongly dependent on the gate voltage and the
longitudinal and perpendicular magnetic fields. By changing the gate voltage or
magnetic fields, the values of $S_c$ and $ZT$ can be easily controlled. At the
zero magnetic fields and zero gate voltage, or at the large perpendicular
magnetic field and nonzero gate voltage, $ZT$ has the large value. Owing to the
electron-hole symmetry, $S_c$ is an odd function of the Fermi energy while $ZT$
is an even function regardless of the magnetic fields. $S_c$ and $ZT$ show
peaks when the quantized transmission coefficient jumps from one plateau to
another. The highest peak appears while the Fermi energy is near the Dirac
point. At the zero perpendicular magnetic field and zero gate voltage, the
height of $n$th peak of $S_C$ is $\frac{k_B}{e}\texttt{ln}2/(|n|+1/2)$ and
$\frac{k_B}{e}\texttt{ln}2/|n|$ for the longitudinal magnetic flux
$\phi_{\parallel} = 0 $ and $\pi$, respectively. Finally, we also study the
effect of disorder and find that $S_c$ and $ZT$ are robust against disorder. In
particular, the large value of $ZT$ can survive even if at the strong disorder.
These characteristics (that $ZT$ has the large value, is easily regulated, and
is robust against the disorder) are very beneficial for the application of the

A clear separation of the different frames is necessary. There are various

the within-class variability. In this work, we propose a generalization of PLDA
that enables joint modeling of two sample-dependent factors: the class of
interest and a nuisance condition. The approach does not change the basic form
of PLDA but rather modifies the training procedure to consider the dependency
across samples of the latent variable that models within-class variability.
While the identity of the nuisance condition is needed during training, it is
not needed during testing since we propose a scoring procedure that
marginalizes over the corresponding latent variable. We show results on a

stable pulse generation is achieved through a balance of periodic amplitude and
phase evolutions. A range of distinct cavity pulse dynamics have been revealed,
arising from the interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity in addition to
dissipative processes such as filtering. This has led to the discovery of
numerous novel operating regimes, offering significantly improved laser
performance. In this Topical Review, we summarise the main steady-state pulse
dynamics reported to date through cavity dispersion engineering, including
average solitons, dispersion-managed solitons, dissipative solitons,
giant-chirped pulses and similaritons. Characteristic features and the
stabilisation mechanism of each regime are described, supported by numerical
modelling, in addition to the typical performance and limitations.
Opportunities for further pulse energy scaling are discussed, in addition to
considering other recent advances including automated self-tuning cavities and
fluoride-fibre-based mid-infrared mode-locked lasers.

However, these do not necessarily scale well to larger environments or spaces

principles of Next-Best Views (NBVs). In this approach, a Micro-Aerial Vehicle
(MAV) equipped with a limited field-of-view depth sensor randomly samples its

high sampling efficiency, our planner maintains and uses a history of visited
places, and locally optimizes the robot's orientation with respect to
unobserved space. We evaluate our method in several simulated scenarios, and
compare it against a state-of-the-art exploration algorithm. The experiments
show substantial improvements in exploration time ($2\times$ faster),
computation time, and path length, and advantages in handling difficult
situations such as escaping dead-ends (up to $20\times$ faster). Finally, we
validate the on-line capability of our algorithm on a computational constrained

useful for approximate whitening of the inputs in front of saturating
non-linearities such as a sigmoid function. This is important for
initialization of training and for reducing the accumulated scale and bias
dependencies (compensating covariate shift), which presumably eases the
learning. In batch normalization, which is currently a very widely applied
technique, sample estimates of statistics of hidden units over a batch are
used. The proposed estimation uses an analytic propagation of mean and variance
of the training set through the network. The result depends on the network
structure and its current weights but not on the specific batch input. The
estimates are suitable for initialization and normalization, efficient to
compute and independent of the batch size. The experimental verification well
supports these claims. However, the method does not share the generalization

of models are able to transfer face attributes with an input image. However,
they suffer from three limitations: (1) incapability of generating image by

simultaneously; (3) low quality of generated images, such as low-resolution or
artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model which
receives two images of opposite attributes as inputs. Our model can transfer
exactly the same type of attributes from one image to another by exchanging
certain part of their encodings. All the attributes are encoded in a
disentangled manner in the latent space, which enables us to manipulate several

to facilitate training on higher resolution images. With the help of
multi-scale discriminators for adversarial training, it can even generate
high-quality images with finer details and less artifacts. We demonstrate the

tunneling density of states in its thermally smeared form motivated by scanning
tunneling microscopy, focusing on the component $\rho_{2 k_F}$ oscillating at
twice the Fermi wavenumber. As a function of temperature $T$ and at zero bias,
we find that the amplitude of $\rho_{2 k_F}$ is nonmonotonic, whereby with
decreasing $T$ an exponential thermal-length-controlled increase, potentially
through an intermediate Kondo logarithm, crosses over to a $T^{1/3}$ decay. The
Kondo logarithm is present only for tip-junction distances sufficiently smaller

The low temperature decay indicates non-Fermi-liquid scattering, in particular
the complete suppression of single-particle scattering at the topological Kondo
fixed point. For temperatures much below the Kondo temperature, we find that
the $\rho_{2 k_F}$ amplitude can be described as a universal scaling function
indicative of strong correlations. In a more general context, our
considerations point towards the utility of $\rho_{2 k_F}$ in studying quantum
impurity systems, including extracting information about the single-particle

it hard to scale these systems to multiple domain image-to-image translation.
We introduce a model that can do both, controllable image generation and
image-to-image translation between multiple domains. We split our image
representation into two parts encoding unstructured and structured information
respectively. The latter is designed in a disentangled manner, so that
different parts encode different image characteristics. We train an encoder to
encode images into these representations and use a small amount of labeled data
to specify what kind of information should be encoded in the disentangled part.
A generator is trained to generate images from these representations using the
characteristics provided by the disentangled part of the representation.
Through this we can control what kind of images the generator generates,
translate images between different domains, and even learn unknown
data-generating factors while only using one single model.

high-Q on-chip WGRs with these substrates by using standard semiconductor

  the theorems. Some additional minor improvements",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown by van den Berg and Steif that the sub-critical and
critical Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of an i.i.d.
process (ffiid), whereas the super-critical model is not. In fact, they showed
that the latter is a general phenomenon in that a phase transition presents an
obstruction for being ffiid. The question remained whether this is the only
such obstruction. We make progress on this, showing that certain spatial mixing
conditions (notions of weak dependence on boundary conditions, not to be
confused with other notions of mixing in ergodic theory) imply ffiid. Our main
result is that weak spatial mixing implies ffiid with power-law tails for the
coding radius, and that strong spatial mixing implies ffiid with exponential
tails for the coding radius. The weak spatial mixing condition can be relaxed
to a condition which is satisfied by some critical two-dimensional models.
Using a result of the author, we deduce that strong spatial mixing also implies
ffiid with stretched-exponential tails from a finite-valued i.i.d. process.
  We give several applications to models such as the Potts model, proper
colorings, the hard-core model, the Widom--Rowlinson model and the beach model.
For instance, for the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at
inverse temperature $\beta$, we show that it is ffiid with exponential tails if
$\beta$ is sufficiently small, it is ffiid if $\beta < \beta_c(q,d)$, it is not
ffiid if $\beta > \beta_c(q,d)$ and, when $d=2$ and $\beta=\beta_c(q,d)$, it is
ffiid if and only if $q \le 4$.

proved that for any values of the parameters there are solutions which tend to

  We describe the dual of $\mathcal{HT}^p_{q,\alpha}(\Bn)$ for the full range

us to the Hardy-Bloch type spaces $\mathcal{BT}^{p}(\Bn)$ and
$\mathcal{BT}^{p,0}(\Bn)$, the latter being the predual of
$\mathcal{HT}^p_{1,\alpha}(\Bn)$. In an analogous fashion, the case
$p=1<q<\infty$ gives rise to Hardy-Carleson type spaces
$\mathcal{CT}_{q,\alpha}(\Bn)$ and $\mathcal{CT}^0_{q,\alpha}(\Bn)$. In the
remaining cases, the duality can be described in terms of the classical Bloch
space $\mathcal{B}(\Bn)$. We also study these spaces in detail, providing
characterizations in terms of fractional derivatives.
  When $p,q\geq 1$, our approach to the question of duality is strongly related
to the boundedness of a certain weighted Bergman projections acting on tent
spaces. For the small exponents, we will also need to apply some other
techniques, such as atomic decompositions and embedding theorems.

stochastic approaches, which have yielded practical tools for a wide range of
model classes. A key benefit is that stochastic variational inference obviates
the tedious process of deriving analytical expressions for closed-form variable
updates. Instead, one simply needs to derive the gradient of the log-posterior,
which is often much easier. Yet for certain model classes, the log-posterior
itself is difficult to optimize using standard gradient techniques. One such
example are random field models, where optimization based on gradient
linearization has proven popular, since it speeds up convergence significantly
and can avoid poor local optima. In this paper we propose stochastic
variational inference with gradient linearization (SVIGL). It is similarly
convenient as standard stochastic variational inference - all that is required
is a local linearization of the energy gradient. Its benefit over stochastic
variational inference with conventional gradient methods is a clear improvement
in convergence speed, while yielding comparable or even better variational
approximations in terms of KL divergence. We demonstrate the benefits of SVIGL
in three applications: Optical flow estimation, Poisson-Gaussian denoising, and
3D surface reconstruction.

The parent compound, Sm$_{0.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$MnO$_3$, exhibits a first-order
paramagnetic-insulator to ferromagnetic-metal transition just below $T_{\rm c}$
= 128 K. With substitution of Ti at Mn sites ($B$-site), $T_{\rm c}$ decreases
approximately linearly at the rate of 22 K$\%^{-1}$ while the width of thermal
hysteresis in magnetization and resistivity increases almost in an exponential
fashion. The most spectacular effect has been observed for the composition
$\eta$=0.03, where a magnetic field of only 1 T yields a huge
magnetoresistance, $1.2 \times 10^7$ $\%$ at $T_c\approx$ 63 K. With increasing
magnetic field, the transition shifts towards higher temperature, and the
first-order nature of the transition gets weakened and eventually becomes
crossover above a critical field ($H_{cr}$) which increases with Ti doping. For
Ti doping above 0.03, the system remains insulting without any ferromagnetic
ordering down to 2 K. The Monte-Carlo calculations based on a two-band double
exchange model show that the decrease of $T_{\rm c}$ with Ti doping is

well-defined gravure cells. The printing plates were mounted on a rotating
horizontal cylinder that is half immersed in an aqueous solution of the anionic
surfactant sodium 1-decanesulfonate. The gravure plates and the presence of
surfactants serve as one example of a real-world dewetting situation. When
rotating the cylinder, a liquid meniscus was partially drawn out of the liquid
forming a dynamic contact angle at the contact line. The dynamic contact angle
is decreased on a structured surface as compared to a smooth one. This is due
to contact line pinning at the borders of the gravure cells. Additionally,
surfactants tend to decrease the dynamic receding contact angle. We consider
the interplay between these two effects. We compare the height differences of
the meniscus on the structured and unstructured area as function of dewetting
speeds. The height difference increases with increasing dewetting speed. With
increasing size of the gravure cells this height difference and the induced
changes in the dynamic contact angle increased. By adding surfactant, the
height difference and the changes in the contact angle for the same surface
decreased. We further note that although the liquid dewets the printing plates
some liquid is always left in the gravure cell. At high enough surfactant
concentrations or high enough dewetting speed, the dynamic contact angles in
the structured surface approach those in flat surfaces. We conclude that
surfactant reduces the influence of surface structure on dynamic dewetting.

of which is the Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory. It modifies the geometrical
structure of manifold and relaxes the notion of affine connection being
symmetric. The theory is also called $U_4$ theory of gravitation; where the
underlying manifold is not Riemannian. The non-Riemannian part of the
space-time is sourced by the spin density of matter. Here mass and spin both
play the dynamical role. We consider the minimal coupling of Dirac field with
EC theory; thereby calling the full theory as Einstein-Cartan-Dirac (ECD)
theory. In the recent works by T.P Singh titled ""A new length scale in quantum
gravity"", the idea of new unified; mass dependent length scale $L_{cs}$ in
quantum gravity has been proposed. We discuss this idea and formulate ECD
theory in both - standard length scales as well as this new length scale. We
found the non-relativistic limit of ECD theory using WKB-like expansion in
$\sqrt{\hbar}/c$ of the ECD field equations with both the length scales. At
leading order, ECD equations with standard length scales give
Schr\""{o}dinger-Newton equation. With $L_{cs}$, in the low mass limit, it gives
source-free Poisson equation and for higher mass limit, it reduces to Poisson
equation with delta function source. Based on this, a falsifiable test of the
idea of $L_{cs}$ has been proposed. Next, we formulate ECD theory with both the
length scales (especially the Dirac equation (Hehl-Datta equation) and
Contorsion spin coefficients) in Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. The idea of
$L_{cs}$ suggests a symmetry between small and large masses. Formulating ECD
theory with $L_{cs}$ in NP formalism is desirable because NP formalism happens
to be the common vocabulary for the description of low masses (Dirac theory)
and high masses (gravity theories). A duality between Curvature and torsion has
also been discussed.

These requirements happen to be critical when it comes to distinguishing
between discrete steady states, Turing unstable transient states, numerical
artifacts or approximate steady states as obtained by a simple upwind approach.
These schemes are obtained either by following closely the gradient flow
structure or by a proper exponential rewriting inspired by the
Scharfetter-Gummel discretization. An interesting feature is that upwind is
also necessary for all the expected properties to be preserved at the
semi-discrete level. These schemes are extended to the fully discrete level and
this leads us to tune precisely the terms according to explicit or implicit

maximum principle), we prove well-posedness for the scheme as well as all the
other requirements. Numerical implementations and simulations illustrate the

evolving weights by casting the language modeling problem into an online
learning-to-learn framework in which a meta-learner is trained by
gradient-descent to continuously update a language model weights.

$m$ is also given to the learner, Angluin-Chen's Las Vegas algorithm
\cite{AC08} runs in $4$ rounds and detects the edges in $O(m\log n)$ queries.
In the other harder case where the number of edges $m$ is unknown, their
algorithm runs in $5$ rounds and asks $O(m\log n+\sqrt{m}\log^2 n)$ queries.
There have been two open problems: \emph{(i)} can the number of queries be
reduced to $O(m\log n)$ in the second case, and, \emph{(ii)} can the number of
rounds be reduced without substantially increasing the number of queries (in
both cases). For the first open problem (when $m$ is unknown) we give two

allowed us to measure the coherent response of the system with the picosecond
time resolution. It is shown that, for resonant selective pulsed excitation of
the localized exciton complexes, the coherent signal is represented by the
photon echoes due to the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions.
In case of resonant excitation of the trions or donor-bound excitons, the
Zeeman splitting of the resident electron ground state levels under the applied
transverse magnetic field results in quantum beats of photon echo amplitude at
the Larmor precession frequency. Application of magnetic field makes it
possible to transfer coherently the optical excitation into the spin ensemble
of the resident electrons and to observe a long-lived photon echo signal. The
described technique can be used as a high-resolution spectroscopy of the energy
splittings in the ground state of the system. Next, we consider the Rabi
oscillations and their damping under excitation with intensive optical pulses
for the excitons complexes with a different degree of localization. It is shown
that damping of the echo signal with increase of the excitation pulse intensity

  Application to Brain Connectome Data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article proposes a Bayesian approach to regression with a continuous
scalar response and an undirected network predictor. Undirected network
predictors are often expressed in terms of symmetric adjacency matrices, with
rows and columns of the matrix representing the nodes, and zero entries
signifying no association between two corresponding nodes. Network predictor
matrices are typically vectorized prior to any analysis, thus failing to
account for the important structural information in the network. This results
in poor inferential and predictive performance in presence of small sample
sizes. We propose a novel class of network shrinkage priors for the coefficient
corresponding to the undirected network predictor. The proposed framework is
devised to detect both nodes and edges in the network predictive of the
response. Our framework is implemented using an efficient Markov Chain Monte
Carlo algorithm. Empirical results in simulation studies illustrate strikingly
superior inferential and predictive gains of the proposed framework in
comparison with the ordinary high dimensional Bayesian shrinkage priors and
penalized optimization schemes. We apply our method to a brain connectome
dataset that contains information on brain networks along with a measure of
creativity for multiple individuals. Here, interest lies in building a
regression model of the creativity measure on the network predictor to identify
important regions and connections in the brain strongly associated with
creativity. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first principled
Bayesian method that is able to detect scientifically interpretable regions and
connections in the brain actively impacting the continuous response
(creativity) in the presence of a small sample size.

it could request mathematical methods with greater or lesser complexity. This
paper introduces the Uranie platform, an Open-source framework which is
currently developed at the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission
(CEA), in the nuclear energy division, in order to deal with uncertainty
propagation, surrogate models, optimisation issues, code calibration... This
platform benefits from both its dependencies, but also from personal
developments, to offer an efficient data handling model, a C++ and Python
interpreter, advanced graphical tools, several parallelisation solutions...
These methods are very generic and can then be applied to many kinds of code
(as Uranie considers them as black boxes) so to many fields of physics as well.
In this paper, the example of thermal exchange between a plate-sheet and a

measured reactor spectra. Global data from the $\nu_e$ disappearance channel
favour sterile neutrino oscillations at the $3\sigma$ level with $\Delta

assumptions on predicted reactor fluxes. In contrast, the anomalies in the
$\nu_e$ appearance channel (dominated by LSND) are in strong tension with
improved bounds on $\nu_\mu$ disappearance, mostly driven by MINOS+ and
IceCube. Under the sterile neutrino oscillation hypothesis, the p-value for
those data sets being consistent is less than $2.6\times 10^{-6}$. Therefore,
an explanation of the LSND anomaly in terms of sterile neutrino oscillations in
the 3+1 scenario is excluded at the $4.7\sigma$ level. This result is robust

writings by Einstein, of which a third have never been published, and the more
than thirteen hundred letters show Einstein's immense productivity and hectic
pace of life.
  Einstein quickly grasps the conceptual peculiarities involved in the new
quantum mechanics, such as the difference between Schr\""odinger's wave function
and a field defined in spacetime, or the emerging statistical interpretation of
both matrix and wave mechanics. Inspired by correspondence with G. Y. Rainich,
he investigates with Jakob Grommer the problem of motion in general relativity,
hoping for a hint at a new avenue to unified field theory.
  Einstein falls victim to scientific fraud when, in a collaboration with E.
Rupp, he becomes convinced that the latter's experiments, aimed at deciding
whether excited atoms emit light instantaneously (in quanta) or in a finite
time (in waves), confirm a wave-theoretic explanation.
  While it was known that the teenage Einstein had been romantically involved
with Marie Winteler in 1895, newly discovered documents reveal that his love
for Marie was rekindled in 1909-10 while he was still married to Mileva
Mari\'c.
  The 1925 Locarno Treaties renew Einstein's optimism in European
reconciliation. He backs the `International manifesto against compulsory
military service' and continues his participation in the League of Nations'
International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. He remains intensely
committed to the shaping of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, although his
enthusiasm for this cause is sorely tested.

developers in the implementation and use of mutable objects whose public
interface depends on their private state. Under this paradigm, well-typed
programs are guaranteed to conform with the protocol of the objects they use.
  Inquiry. Previous works have investigated TSOP for both sequential and
concurrent objects. However, an important difference between the two settings
still remains. In a sequential setting, a well-typed program either progresses
indefinitely or terminates eventually. In a concurrent setting, protocol
conformance is no longer enough to avoid deadlocks, a situation in which the
execution of the program halts because two or more objects are involved in
mutual dependencies that prevent any further progress.
  Approach. In this work, we put forward a refinement of TSOP for concurrent
objects guaranteeing that well-typed programs not only conform with the
protocol of the objects they use, but are also deadlock free. The key
ingredients of the type system are behavioral types, used to specify and
enforce object protocols, and dependency relations, used to represent abstract
descriptions of the dependencies between objects and detect circularities that
might cause deadlocks.
  Knowledge. The proposed approach stands out for two features. First, the
approach is fully compositional and therefore scalable: the objects of a large
program can be type checked in isolation; deadlock freedom of an object
composition solely depends on the types of the objects being composed; any
modification/refactoring of an object that does not affect its public interface
does not affect other objects either. Second, we provide the first deadlock
analysis technique for join patterns, a high-level concurrency abstraction with
which programmers can express complex synchronizations in a succinct and
declarative form.
  Grounding. We detail the proposed typing discipline for a core programming
language blending concurrent objects, asynchronous message passing and join
patterns. We prove that the type system is sound and give non-trivial examples
of programs that can be successfully analyzed. A Haskell implementation of the
type system that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach is publicly
available.
  Importance. The static analysis technique described in this work can be used
to certify programs written in a core language for concurrent TSOP with proven
correctness guarantees. This is an essential first step towards the integration
and application of the technique in a real-world developer toolchain, making
programming of such systems more productive and less frustrating.

a stronger absorption than the maximum allowed value based on the standard
model. One explanation for the required colder primordial gas is the energy
transfer between the baryon and dark matter fluids due to non-gravitational
scattering. Here, we explore the thermal evolution of primordial gas,
collapsing to form Population III (Pop III) stars, when this energy transfer is
included. Performing a series of one-zone calculations, we find that the
evolution results in stars more massive than in the standard model, provided
that the dark matter is described by the best-fit parameters inferred from the
21-cm observation. On the other hand, a significant part of the dark matter
parameter space can be excluded by the requirement to form massive Pop III
stars sufficiently early in cosmic history. Otherwise, the radiation background
needed to bring about the strong Wouthuysen-Field coupling at z >~ 17, inferred
to explain the 21-cm absorption feature, could not be builtup. Intriguingly,
the independent constraint from the physics of first star formation at high
densities points to a similarly narrow range in dark matter properties. This
exploratory study has to be followed-up with self-consistent three-dimensional
simulations for a more rigorous derivation.

numerically solve partial differential equations (PDEs). They take advantage of
being flexible with respect to geometry, easy to implement in higher
dimensions, and can also provide high order convergence. Since one of the main
disadvantages of global RBF-based methods is generally the computational cost
associated with the solution of large linear systems, in this paper we focus on
a localizing RBF partition of unity method (RBF-PUM) based on a finite
difference (FD) scheme. Specifically, we propose a new RBF-PUM-FD collocation
method, which can successfully be applied to solve time-dependent PDEs. This
approach allows to significantly decrease ill-conditioning of traditional
RBF-based methods. Moreover, the RBF-PUM-FD scheme results in a sparse matrix
system, reducing the computational effort but maintaining at the same time a
high level of accuracy. Numerical experiments show performances of our
collocation scheme on two benchmark problems, involving unsteady
convection-diffusion and pseudo-parabolic equations.

sufficient attraction strength, increasing the particle concentration grows the
particle clusters, which further increases the mean settling rate in a physical
mode termed promoted settling. The immersed boundary simulations are compared
to recent experimental measurements of the settling rate in nanoparticle
dispersions for which particles are driven to aggregate by short-ranged
depletion attractions. The simulations are able to quantitatively reproduce the
experimental results. We show that a simple, empirical model for the settling
rate of adhesive hard sphere dispersions can be derived from a combination of
the experimental and computational data as well as analytical results valid in
certain asymptotic limits of the concentration and attraction strength. This
model naturally extends the Richardson-Zaki formalism used to describe hindered
settling of hard, repulsive spheres. Experimental measurements of the
collective diffusion coefficient in concentrated solutions of globular proteins

sticky, globular macromolecules using this new empirical model. Finally,

pose skeleton can be used to better distinguish instances with heavy occlusion
than using bounding-boxes. In this paper, we present a brand new pose-based

human pose, rather than proposal region detection. We demonstrate that our
pose-based framework can achieve better accuracy than the state-of-art

moreover better handle occlusion. Furthermore, there are few public datasets

various cost approximation schemes and assess the convergence of the interval
bounds these induce on the relative value function. Namely: Taylor expansions
(divergent, except for a narrow class of entire functions with low orders of
growth), and uniform approximation schemes (polynomials, trigonometric), which
achieve optimal convergence rates over finite intervals. This study addresses
all the steps to implementing dispatching policies for systems of parallel

the father close to the constraints and similar to the mother close to the

crucial: the two functions must have a common control law that makes both
Lyapunov derivatives simultaneously negative. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
guarantee this property a-priori, i.e., while computing the two parents

Centauri provides a prime target for the search for life on planets outside our
solar system. Atmospheric characterization of these planets has been proposed
by blocking the starlight with a stellar coronagraph and using a
high-resolution spectrograph to search for reflected starlight off the planet.
Due to the large flux ratio and small angular separation between Proxima b and
its host star ($\lesssim10^{-7}$ and $\lesssim2.2\lambda/D$ respectively; at
750nm for an 8m-class telescope) the coronagraph needs to have a high starlight
suppression at low inner-working angles. We aim to find the global optimum of
an integrated coronagraphic integral-field spectrograph. We present the
Single-mode Complex Amplitude Refinement (SCAR) coronagraph that uses a
microlens-fed single-mode fiber array in the focal plane downstream from a
pupil-plane phase plate. The mode-filtering property of the single-mode fibers
allows for the nulling of starlight on the fibers. The phase pattern in the
pupil plane is specifically designed to take advantage of this mode-filtering
capability. Second-order nulling on the fibers expands the spectral bandwidth
and decreases the tip-tilt sensitivity of the coronagraph. The SCAR coronagraph
has a low inner-working angle ($\sim1\lambda/D$) at a contrast of
$<3\times10^{-5}$ for the 6 fibers surrounding the star using a
sufficiently-good adaptive optics system. It can operate over broad spectral
bandwidths ($\sim20\%$) and delivers high throughput ($>50\%$ including fiber
injection losses). Additionally, it is robust against tip-tilt errors
($\sim0.1\lambda/D$ rms). We present SCAR designs for both an unobstructed and
a VLT-like pupil. The SCAR coronagraph is a promising candidate for exoplanet
detection and characterization around nearby stars using current
high-resolution imaging instruments.

of all liquid metals. The role of nucleon motions or ion dynamics has been
somewhat ignored in relation to the dissociative insulator-metal transition.
Almost all previous experimental high-pressure studies have treated the fluid
isotopes, hydrogen and deuterium, with no distinction. Studying both hydrogen
and deuterium at the same density, most crucially at the phase transition line,
can experimentally reveal the importance of ion dynamics. We use static
compression to study the optical properties of dense deuterium in the pressure
region of 1.2-1.7 Mbar and measured temperatures up to ~3000 K. We observe an
abrupt increase in reflectance, consistent with dissociation-induced
metallization, at the transition. Here we show that at the same pressure
(density) for the two isotopes, the phase line of this transition reveals a
prominent isotopic shift, ~700 K. This shift is lower than the isotopic
difference in the free-molecule dissociation energies, but it is still large
considering the high density of the liquid and the complex many-body effects.
Our work reveals the importance of quantum nuclear effects in describing the
metallization transition and conduction properties in dense hydrogen systems at
conditions of giant planetary interiors, and provides an invaluable benchmark
for ab-initio calculations.

other single-molecule processes is the inability to directly visualize the
trajectories and dynamics of atoms and molecules in reactions. Rather, the
kinetics are inferred from ensemble measurements or the position of a
transducer (e.g. an AFM cantilever) as a surrogate variable. Direct
visualization is highly desirable. Here, we achieve the direct measurement of
barrier crossing trajectories by using optical microscopy to observe position
and orientation changes of pairs of Ag nanoparticles in an optical ring trap,
i.e. passing events. A two-step mechanism similar to a bimolecular exchange
reaction is revealed by analysis that combines detailed knowledge of each
trajectory, a statistically significant number of repetitions of the passing
events, and the driving force-dependence of the process. We find that while the
total event rate increases with driving force, this increase is only due to
increased rate of encounters. There is no drive force-dependence on the rate of
barrier crossing because the key motion for the process involves a radial
motion of one particle as a thermal (random) fluctuation allowing the other to
pass. This simple experiment can readily be extended to study more complex
barrier crossing processes by replacing the spherical metal nanoparticles with
anisotropic ones or through more intricate optical trapping potentials.

clusters has ruled out the prospect of detection of 'galaxy groups'. But, the
available simulations and observations of thermal emissions show that the
groups are merger prone, thus non-virialised, indicating better visibility in
the radio waves. Detection of radio emissions from them would help us to
understand the scale-dependent particle acceleration mechanisms also groups can
be a unique laboratory to test the models of cosmic magnetism and canbe the
potential source of WHIMs. So, we have modelled radio emissions from the
simulated structures using {\sc{ENZO}}. We present a model for computing
magnetic field and for the first time, used the electron energy spectrum from
both the Fermi I (DSA) and Fermi II (TRA) mechanisms to compute radio
emissions. Computed radio power from more than 200 simulated objects, mass
ranging $\geq 10^{13}$ to $2\times 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ show a new mass scaling
of $M_{500} \propto P_{1.4\;GHz}^{2.17\pm 0.08}$ and a strong correlation scale
of $L_X \propto P_{1.4\;GHz}^{1.08\pm 0.05}$. Both magnetic field and radio
power are shown to have adequately replicated the available observations at
high mass, allowing us to extend the results to further smaller masses. We
report that groups below $10^{14}\;\rm{M_{\odot}}$ show the existence of 10s of
nano to a sub-$\mu$G magnetic field and about 10$^{19-23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ of radio
power, much higher than what existing mass scaling predicts. We found that the
combined radio power from TRA and DSA electrons can only fit very well to all
the observed `radio halos'. Finally, we have implemented this model on a real
data set obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). It predicts about
10s to 100s $\mu$Jy/(10$\arcsec$ beam) of radio flux in groups indicating their
detectability with existing and aplenty with the future radio telescopes.

gradient of a non-arbitrary scalar function. We use normal coordinates for the
symmetric part of asymmetric connections as well as for the Weyl's geometry.
This has a direct impact on asymmetric conections, although normal frames are
usual in antisymmetic connections, unlike normal coordinates. In this symmetric
part of asymmetric connections, the vector fields obeys a well-known partial
differential equantion, whereas in Weyl's geometry, gauge vector fields obey an

deduce the exact solution of each of these vector fields as the gradient of a

respective scalar functions obey respective scalar partial differential
equations. As a consequence, Weyl's geometry is a conformal differential
geometry and is associated with asymmetric geometry by a projective change. We
also show that a metric tensor naturally appears in asymmetric geometry and is
not introduced via a postulate, as is usually done. In Weyl's geometry, the
eletromagnetic gauge is the gradient of a non-arbitrary scalar function and
eletromagnetic fields are null. Despide the origin in Weyl's differential

actor-critic approaches from reinforcement learning. In the traditional neural
network based methods, the objective is only to maximize the likelihood of the
predicted summaries, no other assessment constraints are considered, which may
generate low-quality summaries or even incorrect sentences. To alleviate this
problem, we employ an actor-critic framework to enhance the training procedure.
For the actor, we employ the typical attention based sequence-to-sequence
(seq2seq) framework as the policy network for summary generation. For the
critic, we combine the maximum likelihood estimator with a well designed global
summary quality estimator which is a neural network based binary classifier
aiming to make the generated summaries indistinguishable from the human-written
ones. Policy gradient method is used to conduct the parameter learning. An
alternating training strategy is proposed to conduct the joint training of the
actor and critic models. Extensive experiments on some benchmark datasets in
different languages show that our framework achieves improvements over the
state-of-the-art methods.

in rectilinear ducts with square cross-sections, and this paper is devoted to
proving rigorously that almost all of these transonic shock solutions are
stable, under multidimensional small perturbations of the upcoming supersonic

This manifests that friction has a stabilization effect on transonic shocks in

has long been acknowledged and while every science contains an artistic part,
every art form also needs a bit of science. Among all scientific disciplines,
programming holds a special place for two reasons. First, the artistic part is
not only undeniable but also essential. Second, and much like in a purely
artistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of
aesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the
importance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more
could still be written on the subject. The field called ""psychology of
programming"" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of
improving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have
emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their
activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought
process while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language
or paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these
questions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light
on the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an
inherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to
find the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they
undertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and
how they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic
sensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own
experiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to
do the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative
activities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and
practicing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why
these specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I
eventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical
domains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp,
Jazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different
after all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which
remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp,
Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you
to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun.
Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or
techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the
meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an
enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may
gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is
perhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming
communities, but that, is for the reader to decide...

a key challenge for enabling the widespread deployment of deep neural networks

recognition that are better suited for embedded devices. In this paper, we
introduce MicronNet, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for
real-time embedded traffic sign recognition designed based on macroarchitecture
design principles (e.g., spectral macroarchitecture augmentation, parameter
precision optimization, etc.) as well as numerical microarchitecture
optimization strategies. The resulting overall architecture of MicronNet is
thus designed with as few parameters and computations as possible while
maintaining recognition performance, leading to optimized information density
of the proposed network. The resulting MicronNet possesses a model size of just
~1MB and ~510,000 parameters (~27x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art)
while still achieving a human performance level top-1 accuracy of 98.9% on the
German traffic sign recognition benchmark. Furthermore, MicronNet requires just
~10 million multiply-accumulate operations to perform inference, and has a
time-to-compute of just 32.19 ms on a Cortex-A53 high efficiency processor.
These experimental results show that highly compact, optimized deep neural

dynamic of our system to improve the prediction. We investigate the behavior of
our algorithm and crucial elements affecting the prediction. By introducing
different categories of pair of nodes, we are able to improve the quality as
well as increase the diversity of our prediction.

  (DATE) 2018",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thermoelectric generation (TEG) has increasingly drawn attention for being
environmentally friendly. A few researches have focused on improving TEG
efficiency at the system level on vehicle radiators. The most recent
reconfiguration algorithm shows improvement in performance but suffers from
major drawback on computational time and energy overhead, and non-scalability
in terms of array size and processing frequency. In this paper, we propose a
novel TEG array reconfiguration algorithm that determines near-optimal
configuration with an acceptable computational time. More precisely, with
$O(N)$ time complexity, our prediction-based fast TEG reconfiguration algorithm
enables all modules to work at or near their maximum power points (MPP).
Additionally, we incorporate prediction methods to further reduce the runtime
and switching overhead during the reconfiguration process. Experimental results
present $30\%$ performance improvement, almost $100\times$ reduction on
switching overhead and $13\times$ enhancement on computational speed compared
to the baseline and prior work. The scalability of our algorithm makes it
applicable to larger scale systems such as industrial boilers and heat
exchangers.

  on FPGA","Accepted to publish in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II:
  Express Brief",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the impressive search rate of one key per clock cycle, the update
stage of a random-access-memory-based content-addressable-memory (RAM-based
CAM) always suffers high latency. Two primary causes of such latency include:
(1) the compulsory erasing stage along with the writing stage and (2) the major
difference in data width between the RAM-based CAM (e.g., 8-bit width) and the
modern systems (e.g., 256-bit width). This brief, therefore, aims for an
efficient input/output (I/O) architecture of RAM-based binary CAM (RCAM) for
low-latency update. To achieve this goal, three techniques, namely centralized
erase RAM, bit-sliced, and hierarchical-partitioning, are proposed to eliminate
the latency of erasing stage, as well as to allow RCAM to exploit the bandwidth
of modern systems effectively. Several RCAMs, whose data width ranges from 8
bits to 64 bits, were integrated into a 256-bit system for the evaluation. The
experimental results in an Intel Arria V 5ASTFD5 FPGA prove that at 100 MHz,
the proposed designs achieve at least 9.6 times higher I/O efficiency as
compared to the traditional RCAM.

development of processing techniques flexible enough to produce materials with
a wide spectrum of solubility (bioresorption rates) and mechanical properties
matching those of calcified tissues. These techniques must also have the
capability of generating adequate porosity to further serve as a framework for
cell penetration, new bone formation, and subsequent remodeling. In this study,
we show how hybrid organic/inorganic scaffolds with controlled microstructures
can be built using robotic assisted deposition at room temperature. Polylactide
or polycaprolactone scaffolds with pore sizes ranging between 200-500 {\mu}m
and hydroxyapatite contents up to 70 wt % were fabricated. Compressive tests
revealed an anisotropic behavior of the scaffolds, strongly dependent on their
chemical composition. The inclusion of an inorganic component increased their
stiffness but they were not brittle and could be easily machined even for
ceramic contents up to 70 wt%. The mechanical properties of hybrid scaffolds
did not degrade significantly after 20 days in simulated body fluid. However,
the stiffness of pure polylactide scaffolds increased drastically due to
polymer densification. Scaffolds containing bioactive glasses were also
printed. After 20 days in simulated body fluid they developed an apatite layer
on their surface.

beyond the standard Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, such as the

since they can provide some new insights into the cosmology, nuclear physics

by the $q$-deformed fermions ($q$-fermion), which is realized by deforming the
quantum algebra of the anticommutation relations. We investigate from a
standard perspective of the finite temperature field theory and try to
construct the finite temperature Green's function formalism for the free
many-$q$-fermion system, then generalize it to the well known interacting
fermionic system, the superconductor, and finally obtain a consistent
$q$-deformed BCS ($q$BCS) theory. At low temperature, this theory predicts a
Sarma-like ordered phase, and we call it the $q$-deformed Sarma phase. It also
presents a symmetric phase diagram in the parameter space and new thermodynamic
relations.

Beck and E.G.D. Cohen, Physica A 322, 267 (2003)] is a
formalism aimed at describing statistical properties of a generic extensive
quantity E in complex out-of-equilibrium systems in terms of a superposition of
equilibrium canonical distributions weighted by a function P(beta) of the
intensive thermodynamic quantity beta conjugate to E. It is commonly assumed
that P(beta) is determined by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the system under
consideration. In this work we show by examples that, in some cases fulfilling
all the conditions for the superstatistics formalism to be applicable, P(beta)
is actually affected also by the way the measurement of E is performed, and
thus is not an intrinsic property of the system.
