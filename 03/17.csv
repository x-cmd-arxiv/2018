holding and manipulating information. Most of the empirical neuroscience
research on working memory has focused on measuring sustained activity in
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and/or parietal cortex during simple delayed-response
tasks, and most of the models of working memory have been based on neural
integrators. But working memory means much more than just holding a piece of
information online. We describe a new theory of working memory, based on a
recurrent neural circuit that we call ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted
Neural Integrator Circuits). ORGaNICs are a variety of Long Short Term Memory
units (LSTMs), imported from machine learning and artificial intelligence.
ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of delay-period activity
in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task. The theory is
analytically tractable so that we can characterize the dynamics, and the theory
provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying
responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. ORGaNICs can
be implemented with a biophysical (electrical circuit) model of pyramidal
cells, combined with shunting inhibition via a thalamocortical loop. Although
introduced as a computational theory of working memory, ORGaNICs are also
applicable to models of sensory processing, motor preparation and motor
control. ORGaNICs offer computational advantages compared to other varieties of
LSTMs that are commonly used in AI applications. Consequently, ORGaNICs are a
framework for canonical computation in brains and machines.

between topological insulators (TIs) by combining layers of iso-structural and
iso-valent TlBi$X_2$ ($X$=S, Se, Te) materials. The composition range for
gapless states is addressed concurrently to the study of thermodynamically

might produce both spinodal superlattices and two dimensional eutectic
microstructures, either concurrently or separately. The dimensions and
topological nature of the metallic channels are determined by following the
spatial distribution of the charge density and the spin-texture. The results
validate the proof of concept for obtaining spontaneously forming
two-dimensional TI-conducting channels embedded into three-dimensional

the long-sought enabler for effective TI technological deployment.

simulation model with a high-dimensional uncertain parameter space (e.g. a
spatial random field) is computationally prohibitive even with gradient
information provided. Moreover, the `nonlinear' mapping from parameters to
observables generally gives rise to non-Gaussian posteriors even with Gaussian
priors, thus hampering the use of efficient inversion algorithms designed for
models with Gaussian assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian
stochastic inversion methodology, characterized by a tight coupling between a
gradient-based Langevin Markov Chain Monte Carlo (LMCMC) method and a kernel
principal component analysis (KPCA). This approach addresses the
`curse-of-dimensionality' via KPCA to identify a low-dimensional feature space
within the high-dimensional and nonlinearly correlated spatial random field.
Moreover, non-Gaussian full posterior probability distribution functions are
estimated via an efficient LMCMC method on both the projected low-dimensional
feature space and the recovered high-dimensional parameter space. We
demonstrate this computational framework by integrating and adapting recent
developments such as data-driven statistics-on-manifolds constructions and
reduction-through-projection techniques to solve inverse problems in linear
elasticity.

predictions. However, models using incomplete atomic data or the assumption of
isothermal plasmas may have biased the best fit Fe abundance in groups and
giant elliptical galaxies low. In this work, we take advantage of a major
update of the atomic code in the spectral fitting package SPEX to re-evaluate
the Fe abundance in 43 clusters, groups, and elliptical galaxies (the CHEERS
sample) in a self-consistent analysis and within a common radius of
0.1$r_{500}$. For the first time, we report a remarkably similar average Fe
enrichment in all these systems. Unlike previous results, this strongly
suggests that metals are synthesised and transported in these haloes with the
same average efficiency across two orders of magnitude in total mass. We show
that the previous metallicity measurements in low temperature systems were
biased low due to incomplete atomic data in the spectral fitting codes. The
reasons for such a code-related Fe bias, also implying previously unconsidered
biases in the emission measure and temperature structure, are discussed.

intra-cluster medium (ICM) metallicity is remarkably uniform in space and time.
In this paper, we analyse a large sample of simulated objects, from poor groups
to rich clusters, to study the dependence of the metallicity and related
quantities on the mass of the systems. The simulations are performed with an
improved version of the Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics \texttt{GADGET-3} code
and consider various astrophysical processes including radiative cooling, metal
enrichment and feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
scaling between the metallicity and the temperature obtained in the simulations
agrees well in trend and evolution with the observational results obtained from
two data samples characterised by a wide range of masses and a large redshift
coverage. We find that the iron abundance in the cluster core ($r<0.1R_{500}$)
does not correlate with the temperature nor presents a significant evolution.
The scale invariance is confirmed when the metallicity is related directly to
the total mass. The slope of the best-fitting relations is shallow
($\beta\sim-0.1$) in the innermost regions ($r<0.5R_{500}$) and consistent with
zero outside. We investigate the impact of the AGN feedback and find that it
plays a key role in producing a constant value of the outskirts metallicity
from groups to clusters. This finding additionally supports the picture of
early enrichment.

characterisations of the stellar component of UDGs to date using deep optical
spectroscopic data from OSIRIS at GTC. We measure radial and rotation
velocities, star formation histories (SFH) and mean population parameters, such
as ages and metallicities, for a sample of five UDG candidates in the Coma
cluster. From the radial velocities, we confirm the Coma membership of these
galaxies. We find that their rotation properties, if detected at all, are
compatible with dwarf-like galaxies. The SFHs of the UDG are dominated by old
(~ 7 Gyr), metal-poor ([M/H] ~ -1.1) and alpha-enhanced ([Mg/Fe] ~ 0.4)
populations followed by a smooth or episodic decline which halted ~ 2 Gyr ago,
possibly a sign of cluster-induced quenching. We find no obvious correlation
between individual SFH shapes and any UDG morphological properties. The
recovered stellar properties for UDGs are similar to those found for DDO44, a
local UDG analogue resolved into stars. We conclude that the UDGs in our sample
are extended dwarfs whose properties are likely the outcome of both internal
processes, such as bursty SFHs and/or high-spin haloes, as well as
environmental effects within the Coma cluster.

with the objective to generate more realistic synthetic images by translating
them to the empirical domain. We first hypothesise and confirm that plant part
image features such as color and texture become more similar to the empirical
domain after translation of the synthetic images.Results confirm this with an
improved mean color distribution correlation with the empirical data prior of
0.62 and post translation of 0.90. Furthermore, the mean image features of
contrast, homogeneity, energy and entropy moved closer to the empirical mean,

to empirical and empirical images. We hypothesised that the translated images
can be used for (i) improved learning of empirical images, and (ii) that
learning without any fine-tuning with empirical images is improved by
bootstrapping with translated images over bootstrapping with synthetic images.
Results confirm our second and third hypotheses. First a maximum
intersection-over-union performance was achieved of 0.52 when bootstrapping
with translated images and fine-tuning with empirical images; an 8% increase
compared to only using synthetic images. Second, training without any empirical
fine-tuning resulted in an average IOU of 0.31; a 55% performance increase over
previous methods that only used synthetic images.

matrix polynomial starts by embedding the matrix coefficients of the polynomial
into a matrix pencil, known as a strong linearization. This process transforms
the problem into an equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem. However, there
are some situations in which is more convenient to replace linearizations by
other low degree matrix polynomials. This has motivated the idea of a strong
$\ell$-ification of a matrix polynomial, which is a matrix polynomial of degree
$\ell$ having the same finite and infinite elementary divisors, and the same
numbers of left and right minimal indices as the original matrix polynomial. We
present in this work a novel method for constructing strong $\ell$-ifications
of matrix polynomials of size $m\times n$ and grade $d$ when $\ell< d$, and
$\ell$ divides $nd$ or $md$. This method is based on a family called ""strong
block minimal bases matrix polynomials"", and relies heavily on properties of
dual minimal bases. We show how strong block minimal bases $\ell$-ifications
can be constructed from the coefficients of a given matrix polynomial
$P(\lambda)$. We also show that these $\ell$-ifications satisfy many desirable
properties for numerical applications: they are strong $\ell$-ifications
regardless of whether $P(\lambda)$ is regular or singular, the minimal indices
of the $\ell$-ifications are related to those of $P(\lambda)$ via constant
uniform shifts, and eigenvectors and minimal bases of $P(\lambda)$ can be
recovered from those of any of the strong block minimal bases
$\ell$-ifications. In the special case where $\ell$ divides $d$, we introduce a
subfamily of strong block minimal bases matrix polynomials named ""block
Kronecker matrix polynomials"", which is shown to be a fruitful source of
companion $\ell$-ifications.

an issue ideally addressed by a Bayesian approach. Despite their suitability,
current Bayesian NMF approaches have failed to gain popularity in an applied

to get stuck in local modes, and require many thousands of samples for
meaningful uncertainty estimates. We address these issues through a
particle-based variational approach to Bayesian NMF that only requires the
joint likelihood to be differentiable for tractability, uses a novel
initialization technique to identify multiple modes in the posterior, and
allows domain experts to inspect a `small' set of factorizations that
faithfully represent the posterior. We introduce and employ a class of

better particle approximations to the Bayesian NMF posterior in less time than

represent how close (locally) a metric space is to a tree from a metric point
of view. The study of Gromov hyperbolicity for geodesic metric spaces can be
reduced to the study of graph hyperbolicity. The main contribution of this
paper is a new characterization of the hyperbolicity of graphs. This
characterization has algorithmic implications in the field of large-scale
network analysis. A sharp estimate of graph hyperbolicity is useful, e.g., in
embedding an undirected graph into hyperbolic space with minimum distortion
[Verbeek and Suri, SoCG'14]. The hyperbolicity of a graph can be computed in
polynomial-time, however it is unlikely that it can be done in subcubic time.
This makes this parameter difficult to compute or to approximate on large
graphs. Using our new characterization of graph hyperbolicity, we provide a
simple factor 8 approximation algorithm for computing the hyperbolicity of an
$n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ in optimal time $O(n^2)$ (assuming that the input is
the distance matrix of the graph). This algorithm leads to constant factor
approximations of other graph-parameters related to hyperbolicity (thinness,
slimness, and insize). We also present the first efficient algorithms for exact
computation of these parameters. All of our algorithms can be used to
approximate the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space.
  We also show that a similar characterization of hyperbolicity holds for all
geodesic metric spaces endowed with a geodesic spanning tree. Along the way, we
prove that any complete geodesic metric space $(X,d)$ has such a geodesic
spanning tree. We hope that this fundamental result can be useful in other
contexts.

entropic time. This construction allows the expression of arbitrary notion of
simultaneity, in accord with relativity. In order to ensure, however, that this

diffuse gas known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). While state-of-the art
simulations excel at reproducing galactic disk properties, many struggle to
drive strong galactic winds or to match the observed ionization structure of
the CGM using only thermal supernova feedback. To remedy this, recent studies
have invoked non-thermal cosmic ray (CR) stellar feedback prescriptions.
However, numerical schemes of CR transport are still poorly constrained. We
explore how the choice of CR transport affects the multiphase structure of the
simulated CGM. We implement anisotropic CR physics in the astrophysical
simulation code, {\sc Enzo} and simulate a suite of isolated disk galaxies with
varying prescriptions for CR transport: isotropic diffusion, anisotropic
diffusion, and streaming. We find that all three transport mechanisms result in
strong, metal-rich outflows but differ in the temperature and ionization
structure of their CGM. Isotropic diffusion results in a spatially uniform,
warm CGM that underpredicts the column densities of low-ions. Anisotropic
diffusion develops a reservoir of cool gas that extends further from the
galactic center, but disperses rapidly with distance. CR streaming projects
cool gas out to radii of 200 kpc, supporting a truly multiphase medium. In
addition, we find that streaming is less sensitive to changes in constant
parameter values like the CR injection fraction, transport velocity, and
resolution than diffusion. We conclude that CR streaming is a more robust
implementation of CR transport and motivate the need for detailed parameter
studies of CR transport.

parameter estimation (PE) pipelines spring into action. These pipelines
leverage approximants to generate large numbers of theoretical gravitational
waveform predictions to characterize the detected signal. One of the most
accurate and physically comprehensive classes of approximants in wide use is
the ""Spinning Effective One Body--Numerical Relativity"" (SEOBNR) family.
Waveform generation with these approximants can be computationally expensive,
which has limited their usefulness in multiple data analysis contexts. In prior
work we improved the performance of the aligned-spin approximant SEOBNR version
2 (v2) by nearly 300x. In this work we focus on optimizing the full
eight-dimensional, precessing approximant SEOBNR version 3 (v3). While several
v2 optimizations were implemented during its development, v3 is far too slow
for use in state-of-the-art source characterization efforts for long-inspiral
detections. Completion of a PE run after such a detection could take centuries
to complete using v3. Here we develop and implement a host of optimizations for
v3, calling the optimized approximant v3_Opt. Our optimized approximant is
about 340x faster than v3, and generates waveforms that are numerically
indistinguishable.

assumption in their Bayesian parameter inference --- that the likelihood has a
Gaussian form. For summary statistics currently used in LSS, this assumption,

We investigate the impact of this assumption on two recent LSS analyses: the
Beutler et al. (2017) power spectrum multipole ($P_\ell$) analysis and the
Sinha et al. (2017) group multiplicity function ($\zeta$) analysis. Using
non-parametric divergence estimators on mock catalogs originally constructed
for covariance matrix estimation, we identify significant non-Gaussianity in
both the $P_\ell$ and $\zeta$ likelihoods. We then use Gaussian mixture density
estimation and Independent Component Analysis on the same mocks to construct
likelihood estimates that approximate the true likelihood better than the
Gaussian $pseudo$-likelihood. Using these likelihood estimates, we accurately
estimate the true posterior probability distribution of the Beutler et al.
(2017) and Sinha et al. (2017) parameters. Likelihood non-Gaussianity shifts
the $f\sigma_8$ constraint by $-0.44\sigma$, but otherwise, does not
significantly impact the overall parameter constraints of Beutler et al.
(2017). For the $\zeta$ analysis, using the pseudo-likelihood significantly
underestimates the uncertainties and biases the constraints of Sinha et al.
(2017) halo occupation parameters. For $\log M_1$ and $\alpha$, the posteriors
are shifted by $+0.43\sigma$ and $-0.51\sigma$ and broadened by $42\%$ and

known to give rise to a new term in the induction equation that can result in a

for long enough, this chiral dynamo instability can amplify magnetic fields
efficiently, which in turn drive turbulence via the Lorentz force. While it has
been demonstrated in numerical simulations that this chiral magnetically driven
turbulence exists and strongly affects the dynamics of the magnetic field, the
details of this process remain unclear. The goal of this paper is to analyse
the energetics of chiral magnetically driven turbulence and its effect on the

a variation of the initial chiral chemical potential and the magnetic Prandtl

energy, Upsilon, in chiral magnetically driven turbulence. Within the parameter
space explored in this study, Upsilon reaches a value of approximately
0.064-0.074 -independently of the initial chiral asymmetry and for Pm=1. Our
simulations suggest, that Upsilon decreases as a power law when increasing Pm
by decreasing the viscosity. While the exact scaling depends on the details of
the fitting criteria and the Reynolds number regime, an approximate result of
Upsilon(Pm)=0.1 Pm^{-0.4} is reported. Using the findings from our numerical

extended by a vector-like $SU(2)_L$ singlet fermion top partner and a real, SM

T\overline{t}+t\overline{T}$ production is possible through loops mediated by
the scalar singlet. We find that, with reasonable coupling strengths, the
production rate of this channel can dominate top partner pair production at top
partner masses of $m_T\gtrsim 1.5$ TeV. In addition, this model allows for the
exotic decay modes $T\rightarrow tg$, $T\rightarrow t \gamma$, and
$T\rightarrow t S$. In much of the parameter space the loop induced decay
$T\rightarrow tg$ dominates and the top partner is quite long lived. New search
strategies are necessary to cover these decay modes. We project the the
sensitivity of the high luminosity LHC to $pp\rightarrow

narrow (0.20 dex age dispersion), as are the [O/M]- and [Mg/M]-age relations.
The age trend of [C/N] is steep and smooth, consistent with stellar evolution.
The [M/H]-age relation has a mean age dispersion of 0.28 dex and a complex
overall structure. The oldest stars in our sample are those with the lowest and
highest metallicities, while the youngest stars are those with solar
metallicity. These results provide strong constraints on theoretical models of

These comparisons support the hypothesis that the solar neighbourhood is
composed of stars born at a range of Galactocentric radii, and that the most
metal-rich stars likely migrated from a region with earlier and more rapid star
formation such as the inner Galaxy.

that N-rich quasars may result from tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by
supermassive black holes. The rapid enhancement of nitrogen and the depletion
of carbon due to the carbon--nitrogen--oxygen cycle in supersolar mass stars
could naturally produce high N/C. However, the TDE hypothesis predicts that the
N/C should change with time, which has never hitherto been observed. Here we

such a process is strictly forbidden for Weyl points related by a mirror

convert into a nodal loop inside a symmetric plane upon the collision. Similar
constraints are identified for systems with multiple mirrors, facilitating
previously unreported nodal-line and nodal-chain semimetals that exhibit both
Fermi-arc and drumhead surface states. We further find that Weyl points in
systems symmetric under a $\pi$-rotation composed with time-reversal are
characterized by an additional integer charge that we call helicity. A pair of
Weyl points with opposite chirality can annihilate only if their helicities
also cancel out. We base our predictions on topological crystalline invariants

tight-binding models. The outlined homotopy description can be directly
generalized to systems with multiple bands and other choices of symmetry.

We detail the numerical implementation of such AO-based e-ph calculations, and
benchmark them against direct density functional theory calculations and
Wannier function (WF) interpolation. The key advantages of AOs over WFs for
e-ph calculations are outlined. Since AOs are fixed basis functions associated
with the atoms, they circumvent the need to generate a material-specific
localized basis set with a trial-and-error approach, as is needed in WFs.
Therefore, AOs are ideal to compute e-ph interactions in chemically and
structurally complex materials for which WFs are challenging to generate, and
are also promising for high-throughput materials discovery. While our results
focus on AOs, the formalism we present generalizes e-ph calculations to
arbitrary localized basis sets, with WFs recovered as a special case.

traditional trip-based and tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental
assumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from
people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent
representation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing,
and microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential
to simulate traffic demand management policies, their practical application is
still limited. One of the main reasons is that these models require a huge
amount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the
pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The
work presented here has a twofold objective: first, to demonstrate the
capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based transport models,
and, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to
estimate the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries
for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone
records. This information is then employed as input for building a transport
MATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves
the quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon
toll policy applied to two different areas of the city and at different times
of the day is then studied. Our results show the way in which the modal share
is modified in each of the considered scenario. The possibility of evaluating
the effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with
the ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area
confirm the advantages of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic
demand management policies.

10427-6032, located in the southern outskirts of the Carina Nebula. We make use
of near-IR data from VISTA, mid-IR from Spitzer and WISE, far-IR from Herschel,
sub-mm from ATLASGAL, and 843 MHz radio-continuum data. Using multi-band
photometry, we find a total of 5 Class I and 29 Class II young stellar object
(YSO) candidates, most of which newly identified, in the 5'$\times$5' region
centered on the IRAS source position. Modeling of the spectral energy
distribution for selected YSO candidates using radiative transfer models shows
that most of these candidates are intermediate mass YSOs in their early
evolutionary stages. A majority of the YSO candidates are found to be
coincident with the cold dense clump at the western rim of the H II region.
Lyman continuum luminosity calculation using radio emission indicates the
spectral type of the ionizing source to be earlier than B0.5-B1. We identified
a candidate massive star possibly responsible for the H II region with an
estimated spectral type B0-B0.5. The temperature and column density maps of the
region constructed by performing pixel-wise modified blackbody fits to the
thermal dust emission using the far-IR data show a high column density
shell-like morphology around the H II region, and low column density (0.6
$\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) and high temperature ($\sim$21 K) matter within
the H II region. Based on the morphology of the region in the ionized and the
molecular gas, and the comparison between the estimated timescales of the H II
region and the YSO candidates in the clump, we argue that the enhanced
star-formation at the western rim of the H II region is likely due to
compression by the ionized gas.

more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many
variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in
precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the
recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly
developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as
deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The
research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the
newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series
data, such as ""Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"", are superior to the traditional
algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show
that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based

error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA
indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that
the number of training times, known as ""epoch"" in deep learning, has no effect

the parameters of interest may be unrepresentative of their actual values for a

wings of the assumed prior distribution, this can lead to extremely inefficient
exploration of the resulting posterior by nested sampling algorithms, with
unnecessarily high associated computational costs. Simple solutions such as
broadening the prior range in such cases might not be appropriate or possible
in real-world applications, for example when one wishes to assume a single
standardised prior across the analysis of a large number of datasets for which
the true values of the parameters of interest may vary. This work therefore
introduces a posterior repartitioning (PR) method for nested sampling
algorithms, which addresses the problem by redefining the likelihood and prior
while keeping their product fixed, so that the posterior inferences and
evidence estimates remain unchanged but the efficiency of the nested sampling
process is significantly increased. Numerical results show that the PR method
provides a simple yet powerful refinement for nested sampling algorithms to

photosynthetic pigment protein complexes, particularly phycobilliprotein such

for novel light harvesting materials operating at room temperature. Vibronic
transport between energetically remote pigments is coherent when the presence
of a resonant vibration supports transient delocalization between the pair of
electronic excited states. Here, we establish the mechanism of vibronic
transport for a model heterodimer across a wide range of molecular parameter
values. The resulting mechanistic map demonstrates that the molecular
parameters of phycobiliproteins in fact support incoherent vibronic transport.
This result points to an important design principle: incoherent vibronic
transport is more efficient than a coherent mechanism when energetic disorder
exceeds the coupling between the donor and vibrationally excited acceptor
states. Finally, our results suggest that the role of coherent vibronic
transport in pigment protein complexes should be reevaluated.

hole seeds that relies on multi-scale gas inflows initiated by the merger of
massive gas-rich galaxies at $z > 6$, where gas has already achieved solar
composition. Hydrodynamical simulations undertaken to explore our scenario show
that supermassive, gravitationally bound gaseous disks, weighing a billion
solar masses and of a few pc in size, form in the nuclei of merger remnants in
less than $10^5$ yr. These could later produce a supermassive protostar or
supermassive star at their center via various mechanisms. Moreover, we present
a new analytical model, based on angular momentum transport in mass-loaded
gravitoturbulent disks. This naturally predicts that a nuclear disk accreting
at rates exceeding $1000 M_{\odot}$/yr, as seen in the simulations, is stable
against fragmentation irrespective of its metallicity. This is at variance with
conventional direct collapse scenarios, which require the suppression of gas
cooling in metal-free protogalaxies for gas collapse to take place. Such high
accretion rates reflect the high free-fall velocities in massive halos
appearing at $z < 10$, and occur naturally as a result of the efficient angular
momentum loss provided by mergers. We discuss the implications of our scenario
on the observed population of high-z quasars and on its evolution to lower
redshifts using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. Finally, we consider
the intriguing possibility that the secondary gas inflows in the unstable disks
might drive gas to collapse into a supermassive black hole directly via the
General Relativistic radial instability. Such {\it dark collapse} route could
generate gravitational wave emission detectable via the future Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). [Abridged]

the current temperature and luminosity of the primary star; 2) obtaining a
period near the observed value of 27.1 years; 3) matching a mass function of
3.0; 4) concurrent Roche lobe overflow and mass transfer; 5) an isotopic ratio
12 C/ 13 C = 5 and, (6) matching the interferometrically determined angular
diameter. A MESA model starting with binary masses of 9.85 + 4.5 Msun , with a
100 day initial period, produces a 1.2 + 10.6 Msun result having a 547 day

Contemporaneously, the accretor then appears as an upper main sequence, early
B-type star. This benchmark model can provide a basis for further exploration
of this interacting binary, and other long period binary stars.

waves at the center and at the edges of magnetic holes in the dayside

magnitude is anti-correlated with particle density. In this article, we examine
the growth mechanisms of these whistler waves and their interaction with the
host magnetic hole. In the observations, as magnetic holes develop and get
deeper, an electron population gets trapped and develops a temperature
anisotropy favorable for whistler waves to be generated. In addition, the
decrease in magnetic field magnitude and the increase in density reduces the
electron resonance energy, which promotes the electron cyclotron resonance. To
investigate this process, we used an expanding box particle-in-cell simulations
to produce the mirror instability, which then evolves into magnetic holes. The
simulation shows that whistler waves can be generated at the center and edges
of magnetic holes, which reproduces the primary features of the MMS
observations. The simulation shows that the electron temperature anisotropy
develops in the center of the magnetic hole once the mirror instability reaches
its nonlinear stage of evolution. The plasma is then unstable to whistler waves
at the minimum of the magnetic field structures. In the saturation regime of
mirror instability, when magnetic holes are developed, the electron temperature
anisotropy appears at the edges of the holes and electron distributions become
more isotropic at the magnetic field minimum. At the edges, the expansion of
magnetic holes decelerates the electrons which leads to temperature
anisotropies.

  Methods",,,,,"econ.EM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an out-of-sample prediction comparison between major
machine learning models and the structural econometric model. Over the past
decade, machine learning has established itself as a powerful tool in many
prediction applications, but this approach is still not widely adopted in
empirical economic studies. To evaluate the benefits of this approach, I use
the most common machine learning algorithms, CART, C4.5, LASSO, random forest,
and adaboost, to construct prediction models for a cash transfer experiment
conducted by the Progresa program in Mexico, and I compare the prediction
results with those of a previous structural econometric study. Two prediction
tasks are performed in this paper: the out-of-sample forecast and the long-term
within-sample simulation. For the out-of-sample forecast, both the mean
absolute error and the root mean square error of the school attendance rates
found by all machine learning models are smaller than those found by the
structural model. Random forest and adaboost have the highest accuracy for the
individual outcomes of all subgroups. For the long-term within-sample
simulation, the structural model has better performance than do all of the
machine learning models. The poor within-sample fitness of the machine learning
model results from the inaccuracy of the income and pregnancy prediction
models. The result shows that the machine learning model performs better than
does the structural model when there are many data to learn; however, when the
data are limited, the structural model offers a more sensible prediction. The
findings of this paper show promise for adopting machine learning in economic
policy analyses in the era of big data.

one approach is to use an individual block code for each section. However, the
performance over a section affected by a lower SNR is weaker compared to the
performance over a section affected by a higher SNR. Spatially-coupled (SC)
codes are a family of graph-based codes with capacity approaching performance
and low latency decoding. An SC code is constructed by partitioning an
underlying block code to several component matrices, and coupling copies of the

First, we present a new partitioning technique to efficiently construct SC

correction for each section by means of the underlying codes that cover one
section each, and simultaneously, an added level of error correction by means
of coupling among the underlying codes. Third, we introduce a low-complexity

performance over channels with SNR variation. Our simulation results show that
our SC codes outperform individual block codes by more than 1 and 2 orders of

0.01 L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$ to $10 L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$. The simulations directly
test the stability of this standard disk model on the different branches. We
find clear evidence of thermal instability for all radiation-pressure-dominated

some cases then settle onto the stable, gas-pressure-dominated branch. Although
these results are consistent with decades-old theoretical predictions, they

X-ray binaries. We also find evidence for a radiation-pressure-driven
instability that breaks the unstable disks up into alternating rings of high
and low surface density on a timescale comparable to the thermal collapse.
Since radiation is included self-consistently in the simulations, we are able
to calculate lightcurves and power density spectra (PDS). For the most part, we
measure radiative efficiencies (ratio of luminosity to mass accretion rate)
close to 6%, as expected for a non-rotating black hole. The PDS appear as
broken power laws, with a break typically around 100 Hz. There is no evidence

time-varying gravitational constant. Assuming a present value of w equals -.98,
we predict a current variation of G dot/G = -.06 H0. H0 is Hubbles parameter, G
is Newtons constant and G dot is the derivative of G with respect to time.
Thus, G has a cosmic origin, is decreasing with respect to cosmological time,
and is proportional to H0, as originally proposed by the Dirac-Jordan
hypothesis. Within our model, we can explain the cosmological constant
fine-tuning problem, the discrepancy between the present very weak value of the
cosmological constant, and the much greater vacuum energy found in earlier
epochs. To formalize and solidify our model, we give two distinct functions of
G(a), the cosmic scale parameter. We treat inverse G as an order parameter,
which vanishes at high energies; at low temperatures, it reaches a saturation
value, a value we are close to today. Our first function for inverse G is
motivated by a charging capacitor; the second treats inverse G by analogy to a
magnetic response. Both functions, even though very distinct, give a remarkably
similar tracking behavior for w(a). Interestingly, both functions indicate the
onset of G formation at a temperature of approximately 7 *1021 degrees Kelvin,
in contrast to the concordance model. At the temperature of formation, we find
that G has increased to roughly 4*1020 times its present value. For most of
cosmic evolution, however, our variable G model gives results similar to the
predictions of the concordance model, except in the very early universe, as we
shall demonstrate. Within our framework, the weakening of G to its current
value G0 is speculated as the true cause for the observed unanticipated
acceleration of the universe.

failure strength/strain decreases with increasing temperature, and the

candidate in the field of impact protection or protective shield. By
considering a monolayer graphene membrane, in this work, we assessed its
deformation mechanisms under hypervelocity impact (from 2 to 6 km/s), based on
a serial of in silico studies. It is found that the cracks are formed
preferentially in the zigzag directions which are consistent with that observed
from tensile deformation. Specifically, the boundary condition is found to
exert an obvious influence on the stress distribution and transmission during
the impact process, which eventually influences the penetration energy and
crack growth. For similar sample size, the circular shape graphene possesses
the best impact resistance, followed by hexagonal graphene membrane. Moreover,
it is found the failure shape of graphene membrane has a strong relationship
with the initial kinetic energy of the projectile. The higher kinetic energy,
the more number the cracks. This study provides a fundamental understanding of
the deformation mechanisms of monolayer graphene under impact, which is crucial
in order to facilitate their emerging future applications for impact
protection, such as protective shield from orbital debris for spacecraft.

Blaschke unwinding adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD). The Blaschke unwinding
AFD is a newly developed signal decomposition theory. It utilizes the
Nevanlinna factorization and the maximal selection principle in each
decomposition step, and achieves a faster convergence rate with higher
fidelity. The proposed compression algorithm is applied to the
electrocardiogram signal. To assess the performance of the proposed compression
algorithm, in addition to the generic assessment criteria, we consider the less
discussed criteria related to the clinical needs -- for the heart rate
variability analysis purpose, how accurate the R peak information is preserved
is evaluated. The experiments are conducted on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark
database. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than
other state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it also well preserves the R peak

networks have been informed by results from the physics of disordered many-body

study the mathematically tractable bipartite Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin
glass model, which is formally similar to a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
neural network. The bipartite SK model has been previously studied assuming
replica symmetry; here this assumption is relaxed and a replica symmetry
breaking analysis is performed. The bipartite SK model is found to have many
features in common with Parisi's solution of the original, unipartite SK model,
including the existence of a multitude of pure states which are related in a
hierarchical, ultrametric fashion. As an application of this analysis, the
optimal cost for a graph partitioning problem is shown to be simply related to
the ground state energy of the bipartite SK model. As a second application,
empirical investigations reveal that the Gibbs sampled outputs of an RBM
trained on the MNIST data set are more ultrametrically distributed than the
input data itself.

computation and communication. There have been two lines of research that try
to deal with slower networks: {\em communication compression} for low bandwidth
networks, and {\em decentralization} for high latency networks. In this paper,
We explore a natural question: {\em can the combination of both techniques lead
to a system that is robust to both bandwidth and latency?}
  Although the system implication of such combination is trivial, the
underlying theoretical principle and algorithm design is challenging: unlike
centralized algorithms, simply compressing exchanged information, even in an
unbiased stochastic way, within the decentralized network would accumulate the
error and fail to converge. In this paper, we develop a framework of
compressed, decentralized training and propose two different strategies, which
we call {\em extrapolation compression} and {\em difference compression}. We
analyze both algorithms and prove both converge at the rate of $O(1/\sqrt{nT})$
where $n$ is the number of workers and $T$ is the number of iterations,
matching the convergence rate for full precision, centralized training. We
validate our algorithms and find that our proposed algorithm outperforms the
best of merely decentralized and merely quantized algorithm significantly for
networks with {\em both} high latency and low bandwidth.

short autoregressive filter enhances the nonstationary component of the plasma
fluctuations by removing much of the background level of stationary
fluctuations. Between ELMs, the spectrum predominantly consists of broad-banded
300-700 kHz fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic drift
direction, indicating the presence of a negative electric field near the plasma

  correlations with wavefunctions in physical space","Final published version","Found Phys (2019) 49: 83","10.1007/s10701-018-0231-7",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We construct a local $\psi$-epistemic hidden-variable model of Bell
correlations by a retrocausal adaptation of the originally superdeterministic
model given by Brans. In our model, for a pair of particles the joint quantum
state $|\psi_e(t)\rangle$ as determined by preparation is epistemic. The model
also assigns to the pair of particles a factorisable joint quantum state
$|\psi_o(t)\rangle$ which is different from the prepared quantum state
$|\psi_e(t)\rangle$ and has an ontic status. The ontic state of a single
particle consists of two parts. First, a single particle ontic quantum state
$\chi(\vec{x},t)|i\rangle$, where $\chi(\vec{x},t)$ is a 3-space wavepacket and
$|i\rangle$ is a spin eigenstate of the future measurement setting. Second, a
particle position in 3-space $\vec{x}(t)$, which evolves via a de Broglie-Bohm
type guidance equation with the 3-space wavepacket $\chi(\vec{x},t)$ acting as
a local pilot wave. The joint ontic quantum state $|\psi_o(t)\rangle$ fixes the
measurement outcomes deterministically whereas the prepared quantum state
$|\psi_e(t)\rangle$ determines the distribution of the $|\psi_o(t)\rangle$'s
over an ensemble. Both $|\psi_o(t)\rangle$ and $|\psi_e(t)\rangle$ evolve via
the Schrodinger equation. Our model exactly reproduces the Bell correlations
for any pair of measurement settings. We also consider `non-equilibrium'
extensions of the model with an arbitrary distribution of hidden variables. We
show that, in non-equilibrium, the model generally violates no-signalling
constraints while remaining local with respect to both ontology and interaction
between particles. We argue that our model shares some structural similarities
with the modal class of interpretations of quantum mechanics.

selection in astrophysics involve the use of Monte Carlo techniques such as
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling. However, these techniques
are time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult to
determine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to
solve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter
estimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts
the inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the
posterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler
divergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast
optimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and
makes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a new
approximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance
sampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the
calculation of evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model
selection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational inference to five
different problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were
previously used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation
in the COSINE-100 dark matter experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital
parameters from radial velocity data, tests of periodicities in measurements of
Newton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover in the spectral
lag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak
gravitational lensing. We find that variational inference is much faster than
MCMC and nested sampling techniques for most of these problems while providing
competitive results. All our analysis codes have been made publicly available.

challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of traffic flows. Though
supervised learning can be used, parameters may vary across roadway junctions.
In this paper, we present a computer vision guided expert system that can learn
the departure rate of a given traffic junction modeled using traditional
queuing theory. First, we temporally group the optical flow of the moving
vehicles using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). These groups are
referred to as tracklets or temporal clusters. Tracklet features are then used
to learn the dynamic behavior of a traffic junction, especially during on/off
cycles of a signal. The proposed queuing theory based approach can predict the
signal open duration for the next cycle with higher accuracy when compared with
other popular features used for tracking. The hypothesis has been verified on
two publicly available video datasets. The results reveal that the DPMM based
features are better than existing tracking frameworks to estimate $\mu$. Thus,
signal duration prediction is more accurate when tested on these datasets.The
method can be used for designing intelligent operator-independent traffic
control systems for roadway junctions at cities and highways.

excitonic complexes and Fermi edge singularity as a function of applied bias
around 100 K. In lower density regimes (<1x1011cm^-2), the appearance of two
distinct peaks in the spectra are identified as a signature of coexistence of
both excitons and positively charged trions. We estimate the binding energy of
these trions as ~2.0 meV. In the higher density regimes (>1x10^11 cm^-2), we
observe a sharp spectral transition from trions to asymmetric shaped Fermi edge
singularity in the photocapacitance spectra around a particular reverse bias.
However, these signatures are absent from the photoluminescence spectra
measured under identical circumstances. Such dissimilarities clearly point out
that different many body physics govern these two spectral measurements. We
also argue why such quantum confined dipoles of spatially indirect trions can
have thermodynamically finite probability to survive even around 100 K.
Finally, our observations demonstrate that photocapacitance technique, which
was seldom used to detect trions in the past, can also be useful to detect the
traces of these spatially indirect excitonic complexes as well as Fermi edge
singularity even at 100 K. This is mainly due to enhanced sensitivity of such
dielectric measurements to dipolar changes within such heterojunction.

since the learning process on large data is slow, partial datasets are randomly
picked for the evaluation to dramatically speed it up. The proposed algorithm
is examined and compared with 12 existing algorithms including the state-of-art
methods on three widely used image classification benchmark datasets. The

deformation from this flat state, either caused by thermal fluctuations or due
to protrusive polymerization force exerted by the filaments, costs energy. We
study two lattice models to describe the membrane dynamics. In one case, the
energy cost is assumed to be proportional to the absolute magnitude of the
height gradient (gradient model) and in the other case it is proportional to
the square of the height gradient (Gaussian model). For the gradient model we
find that the membrane velocity is a non-monotonic function of the elastic
constant $\mu$, and reaches a peak at $\mu=\mu^\ast$. For $\mu < \mu^\ast$ the
system fails to reach a steady state and the membrane energy keeps increasing
with time. For the Gaussian model, the system always reaches a steady state and
the membrane velocity decreases monotonically with the elastic constant $\nu$
for all nonzero values of $\nu$. Multiple filaments give rise to protrusions at
different regions of the membrane and the elasticity of the membrane induces an
effective attraction between the two protrusions in the Gaussian model which
causes the protrusions to merge and a single wide protrusion is present in the
system. In both the models, the relative time-scale between the membrane and
filament dynamics plays an important role in deciding whether the shape of
elasticity-velocity curve is concave or convex. Our numerical simulations agree
reasonably well with our analytical calculations.

success with its performance greatly outperforms any other unsupervised
methods. However, annotating per-pixel saliency masks is a tedious and
inefficient procedure. In this paper, we note that superior salient object
detection can be obtained by iteratively mining and correcting the labeling
ambiguity on saliency maps from traditional unsupervised methods. We propose to
use the combination of a coarse salient object activation map from the
classification network and saliency maps generated from unsupervised methods as
pixel-level annotation, and develop a simple yet very effective algorithm to
train fully convolutional networks for salient object detection supervised by
these noisy annotations. Our algorithm is based on alternately exploiting a
graphical model and training a fully convolutional network for model updating.
The graphical model corrects the internal labeling ambiguity through spatial
consistency and structure preserving while the fully convolutional network
helps to correct the cross-image semantic ambiguity and simultaneously update
the coarse activation map for next iteration. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed method greatly outperforms all state-of-the-art unsupervised
saliency detection methods and can be comparable to the current best
strongly-supervised methods training with thousands of pixel-level saliency map
annotations on all public benchmarks.

integrality property of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for this
problem: while the optimal solution to the SDP is not integer-valued in
general, its estimation error can be upper bounded by that of an idealized
integer program. The error of the integer program, and hence that of the SDP,
are further shown to decay exponentially in the signal-to-noise ratio. In
addition, we show that the SDP relaxation is robust under the semi-random
setting in which an adversary can modify the data generated from the mixture
model. In particular, we generalize the hidden integrality property to the
semi-random model and thereby show that SDP achieves the optimal error bound in
this setting. These results together highlight the ""global-to-local"" mechanism
that drives the performance of the SDP relaxation.
  To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first exponentially decaying
error bound for convex relaxations of mixture models. A corollary of our
results shows that in certain regimes the SDP solutions are in fact integral
and exact. More generally, our results establish sufficient conditions for the
SDP to correctly recover the cluster memberships of $(1-\delta)$ fraction of
the points for any $\delta\in(0,1)$. As a special case, we show that under the
$d$-dimensional Stochastic Ball Model, SDP achieves non-trivial (sometimes
exact) recovery when the center separation is as small as $\sqrt{1/d}$, which

equivalent to employing two eigenfrequency-tunable mechanical resonators. Both
drive-probe detuning for single-color EIT and the distance between transparent
windows for two-color EIT, can be adjusted by tuning the modulation frequency

case (and is itself a special case of others). We give a surprising $n^{O(\log
k)}$-time learning algorithm based on higher-order multilinear moments. It is
not possible to learn the parameters because the same distribution can be
represented by quite different models. Instead, we develop a framework for
reasoning about how multilinear moments can pinpoint essential features of the
mixture, like the number of components.
  We also give applications of our algorithm to learning decision trees with
stochastic transitions (which also capture interesting scenarios where the
transitions are deterministic but there are latent variables). Using our
algorithm for learning mixtures of subcubes, we can approximate the Bayes
optimal classifier within additive error $\epsilon$ on $k$-leaf decision trees
with at most $s$ stochastic transitions on any root-to-leaf path in $n^{O(s +
\log k)}\cdot\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ time. In this stochastic setting, the
classic Occam algorithms for learning decision trees with zero stochastic
transitions break down, while the low-degree algorithm of Linial et al.
inherently has a quasipolynomial dependence on $1/\epsilon$.
  In contrast, as we will show, mixtures of $k$ subcubes are uniquely
determined by their degree $2 \log k$ moments and hence provide a useful
abstraction for simultaneously achieving the polynomial dependence on
$1/\epsilon$ of the classic Occam algorithms for decision trees and the
flexibility of the low-degree algorithm in being able to accommodate stochastic
transitions. Using our multilinear moment techniques, we also give the first

They detect droplets either by impact or optical based methods. Optical based
ones, use light source and an optical detector. Droplet crossing the light
creates shadow on the detector. This change in the intensity and duration of
change provides the size and speed of the droplet. Whereas the impact based
method utilizes peizo elements to sense the droplet by physical momentum
transfer at the time of droplets impact with the sensor. Apart from the
technical differences in them, both of these disdrometers fall in the similar
cost range. Wind turbulence sensors works on detection of gradients in wind
speeds by employing various working principles like thermal anemometer, laser
Doppler anemometer, etc. In thermo anemometers, a heating element is maintained
at a constant temperature. As the wind flows, it carries some heat energy away
from the element. This causes a change in the resistance in the heating element
providing further change in voltages across it. Laser Doppler anemometers work
on change in wavelength of light scattered by a moving particle which is caught
in the wind flow. These techniques are highly accurate in measuring the
turbulence in the air but at elevated costs. Aimed at cost efficacy and
acceptable performance of the device, a novel concept was implemented in a
single device to study its feasibility to work as a disdrometer and a
turbulence sensor. It employs the principles of electromagnetic induction and
response of a cantilever to impulses. Based on these principles, a device was
designed and fabricated to detect rain droplet size and wind turbulence. It was
fabricated from readily available materials. The testing of the device in
laboratory conditions yielded satisfactory results as compare to the standard
