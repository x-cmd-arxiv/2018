optimization problems. Following the classical literature we assume access to a

can be implemented using $\tilde{O}(1)$ quantum queries to a membership oracle,
which is an exponential quantum speed-up over the $\Omega(n)$ membership
queries that are needed classically. We show that a quantum computer can very
efficiently compute an approximate subgradient of a convex Lipschitz function.
Combining this with a simplification of recent classical work of Lee, Sidford,
and Vempala gives our efficient separation oracle. This in turn implies, via a
known algorithm, that $\tilde{O}(n)$ quantum queries to a membership oracle
suffice to implement an optimization oracle (the best known classical upper
bound on the number of membership queries is quadratic). We also prove several
lower bounds: $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ quantum separation (or membership) queries are
needed for optimization if the algorithm knows an interior point of the convex
set, and $\Omega(n)$ quantum separation queries are needed if it does not.

data: fixation pixel map which records the human eye movements on sample

corresponding fixation pixel map. Current saliency approaches perform
prediction by directly pixel-wise regressing the input image into saliency map
with fixation blob as ground truth, yet learning saliency from fixation pixel
map is not explored. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind approach of
learning saliency prediction from sparse fixation pixel map, and a novel loss
function for training from such sparse fixation. We utilize clustering to
extract sparse fixation pixel from the raw fixation pixel map, and add a
max-pooling transformation on the output to avoid false penalty between sparse
outputs and labels caused by nearby but non-overlapping saliency pixels when
calculating loss. This approach provides a novel perspective for achieving
saliency prediction. We evaluate our approach over multiple benchmark datasets,

The main challenge in doing so is to assess whether students apply the methods

This paper presents experiences from a classroom project where 38 students
developed a single system using a scaled version of Scrum. Surveys helped us to
identify which elements of Scrum correlated most with student satisfaction or
posed the biggest challenges. These insights were augmented by a team of
tutors, which accompanied main meetings throughout the project to provide
feedback to the teams, and captured impressions of method application in
practice. Finally, we performed a post-hoc, tool-supported analysis of
collaboration artifacts to detect concrete indicators for anti-patterns in
Scrum adoption. Through the combination of these techniques we were able to
understand how students implemented Scrum in this course and which elements
require further lecturing and tutoring in future iterations. Automated analysis
of collaboration artifacts proved to be a promising addition to the development
process that could potentially reduce manual efforts in future courses and
allow for more concrete and targeted feedback, as well as more objective
assessment.

equivalent to an optimal coding problem. We show that the codes that achieve
optimal compression in MDL are critical in a very precise sense. First, when
they are taken as generative models of samples, they generate samples with
broad empirical distributions and with a high value of the relevance, defined
as the entropy of the empirical frequencies. These results are derived for
different statistical models (Dirichlet model, independent and pairwise
dependent spin models, and restricted Boltzmann machines). Second, MDL codes
sit precisely at a second order phase transition point where the symmetry
between the sampled outcomes is spontaneously broken. The order parameter
controlling the phase transition is the coding cost of the samples. The phase
transition is a manifestation of the optimality of MDL codes, and it arises
because codes that achieve a higher compression do not exist. These results
suggest a clear interpretation of the widespread occurrence of statistical
criticality as a characterization of samples which are maximally informative on
the underlying generative process.

Here, instead of allowing these changes to occur naturally, we report a
technique for actively controlling the spoke by adjusting the boundary
condition at the anode. The technique is demonstrated using a cylindrical Hall
thruster equipped with a segmented anode. By varying the voltage and the
relative phases of the anode segments, properties of the azimuthal mode can be
altered substantially, as shown by fast camera images and probe diagnostics.
This technique may be extended to other Hall discharges in order to either
induce or suppress azimuthal activities, and thereby controlling the operation

hosts, applications, access networks, routers, and other middleboxes, follow a
single protocol and they trust each other. In this article, we investigate the
participation of these entities in providing QoS over wireless networks in
light of DiffServ QoS architecture. We initiate the study by investigating WiFi
and Cellular network traces, which further motivates us a thorough
investigation of these stakeholders with empirical measurements. Our findings
are the followings. (i) Modern mobile VoIP applications request QoS to the
network. (ii) While the operating systems support basic APIs requesting QoS,
application developers either are not aware of such requirements or they misuse
the architecture for improved QoS. (iii) Wireless access networks rewrite the
QoS requirements at the edge and enforce the rest of the routers or hops to
provide best effort service. (iv) QoS requests are also nullified by the secure
tunnels. (v) Although the access networks may nullify the QoS requests, the
performance of the network still may differentiate traffic. We further
emphasize that although the latest 5G network considers DiffServ QoS framework,
it cannot deal with the challenges posed by the privacy related applications.
Network neutrality is going to pose similar challenges.

the average valence of Eu was observed in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
rate $1/T_1$. With the occurrence of the Kondo effect, $1/T_1$ was clearly
reduced below 40 K, and the Knight shift becomes almost constant at low
temperatures. From these results, the formation of heavy quasiparticles by the
hybridization of Eu $4f$ electrons and conduction electrons was clarified from
microscopic viewpoints. Furthermore, a characteristic spin fluctuation was
observed at low temperatures, which would be associated with valence
fluctuations caused by the intermediate valence state of EuNi$_2$P$_2$.

frequencies with millisecond duration, whose origin is likely extragalactic.
Their nature remains mysterious, motivating searches for counterparts at other
wavelengths. FRB 121102 is so far the only source known to repeatedly emit FRBs
and is associated with a host galaxy at redshift $z \simeq 0.193$. We conducted
simultaneous observations of FRB 121102 with the Arecibo and MAGIC telescopes
during several epochs in 2016--2017. This allowed searches for
millisecond-timescale burst emission in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays as
well as the optical band. While a total of five FRBs were detected during these
observations, no VHE emission was detected, neither of a persistent nature nor
burst-like associated with the FRBs. The average integral flux upper limits
above 100 GeV at 95% confidence level are $6.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{photons\
cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ (corresponding to luminosity $L_{\rm VHE} \lesssim
10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) over the entire observation period, and $1.2
\times 10^{-7}~ \mathrm{photons\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ ($L_{\rm VHE} \lesssim
10^{49}~\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) over the total duration of the five FRBs. We
constrain the optical U-band flux to be below 8.6 mJy at 5-$\sigma$ level for
1-ms intervals around the FRB arrival times. A bright burst with U-band flux
$29~\mathrm{mJy}$ and duration $\sim 12$ ms was detected 4.3 s before the
arrival of one FRB. However, the probability of spuriously detecting such a
signal within the sampled time space is 1.5% (2.2 $\sigma$, post-trial), i.e.
consistent with the expected background. We discuss the implications of the
obtained upper limits for constraining FRB models.

  Locality-constrained Representation and Reproducing Learning","13 pages, 15 figures, Accepted by IEEE TCYB",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face hallucination is a technique that reconstruct high-resolution (HR) faces
from low-resolution (LR) faces, by using the prior knowledge learned from HR/LR
face pairs. Most state-of-the-arts leverage position-patch prior knowledge of
human face to estimate the optimal representation coefficients for each image
patch. However, they focus only the position information and usually ignore the
context information of image patch. In addition, when they are confronted with
misalignment or the Small Sample Size (SSS) problem, the hallucination
performance is very poor. To this end, this study incorporates the contextual
information of image patch and proposes a powerful and efficient context-patch
based face hallucination approach, namely Thresholding Locality-constrained
Representation and Reproducing learning (TLcR-RL). Under the context-patch
based framework, we advance a thresholding based representation method to
enhance the reconstruction accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To
further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, we propose a
promotion strategy called reproducing learning. By adding the estimated HR face
to the training set, which can simulates the case that the HR version of the
input LR face is present in the training set, thus iteratively enhancing the
final hallucination result. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed TLcR-RL
method achieves a substantial increase in the hallucinated results, both
subjectively and objectively. Additionally, the proposed framework is more
robust to face misalignment and the SSS problem, and its hallucinated HR face
is still very good when the LR test face is from the real-world. The MATLAB
source code is available at https://github.com/junjun-jiang/TLcR-RL

reionization, the primordial gas was much colder than expected. The cooling of
the gas could be explained by interactions between dark matter (DM) and
particles in the primordial gas. Constraints from cosmology and particle
experiments indicate that this DM should be light ($\sim$10-80 MeV), carry a
small charge ($\epsilon\sim 10^{-6}$-$10^{-4}$), and only make up a small
fraction of the total amount of DM. Several constraints on the DM parameter
space have already been made. We explore the yet unconstrained region in the
case that the milli-charged DM makes up for $\sim$2\% of the total dark matter,
through the scenario in which this DM annihilates only into mu and tau
neutrinos. We set upper limits on the annihilation cross section using the
Super-Kamiokande data, and predict the limits that could be obtained through
Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO and DUNE. We find that data from Super-Kamiokande is not

update of the current limits, and predict the limits that could be placed with
future experiments.

method. Here we extend that study to a wide range of binary masses including
neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS), NS-BH, and BH-BH binaries with BH masses
up to $110 \, M_{\odot}$. The measurement error of eccentricity $e_{10 \,\rm
Hz}$ at a gravitational-wave (GW) frequency of $10 \, {\rm Hz}$ is in the range
$(10^{-4}-10^{-3}) \times (D_L/ 100\,\rm Mpc)$ for NS-NS, NS-BH, and BH-BH
binaries at a luminosity distance of $D_L$ if $e_{10 \,\rm Hz} \gtrsim 0.1 $.
For events with masses and distances similar to the detected 10 GW transients,
we show that nonzero orbital eccentricities may be detected if $0.081 \lesssim
e_{10 \,\rm Hz}$. Consequently, the LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA detector network at design
sensitivity will have the capability to distinguish between eccentric waveforms
and circular waveforms. In comparison to circular inspirals, we find that the
chirp mass measurement precision can improve by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ and
$\sim 50-100$ for NS-NS and NS-BH binaries with BH companion masses $\lesssim

give information on their astrophysical origin; it would indicate merging
binaries in triple or higher multiplicity systems or dynamically formed
binaries in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters or galactic nuclei.

very low optical fluxes, and that both types of outflow features are observed

interaction between question and passage within each layer, which contributes
to reasonable representation and understanding of the model. Combining these
two contributions, we enhance the diversity of dataset and the information

13th magnitude K-dwarf in a 1.34d orbit. NGTS-4b has a mass M=$20.6\pm3.0$M_E
and radius R=$3.18\pm0.26$R_E, which places it well within the so-called
""Neptunian Desert"". The mean density of the planet ($3.45\pm0.95$g/cm^3) is
consistent with a composition of 100% H$_2$O or a rocky core with a volatile
envelope. NGTS-4b is likely to suffer significant mass loss due to relatively
strong EUV/X-ray irradiation. Its survival in the Neptunian desert may be due
to an unusually high core mass, or it may have avoided the most intense X-ray
irradiation by migrating after the initial activity of its host star had
subsided. With a transit depth of $0.13\pm0.02$%, NGTS-4b represents the
shallowest transiting system ever discovered from the ground, and is the
smallest planet discovered in a wide-field ground-based photometric survey.

well-studied sample of 167 bona fide X-ray galaxy clusters ($0.1<z<0.5$) from

that drive AGN and galaxy evolution within clusters. The XXL cluster sample
mostly comprises poor and moderately rich structures ($M=10^{13} -
4\times10^{14} M_{\rm o}$). Our aim is to statistically study the demographics
of cluster AGNs as a function of cluster mass and host galaxy position. To
investigate the effect of the environment on AGN activity, we computed the
fraction of spectroscopically confirmed X-ray AGNs ($L_{\rm X
[0.5-10\,keV]}>10^{42}$ erg cm$^{-1}$) in bright cluster galaxies, up to
$6r_{500}$ radius. To study the mass dependence and the evolution of the AGN
population, we further divided the sample into low- and high-mass clusters and
two redshift bins (0.1-0.28 and 0.28-0.5). We detect a significant excess of
X-ray AGNs, at the 95% confidence level, in low-mass clusters between
$0.5r_{500}$ and 2$r_{500}$, which drops to the field value within the cluster
cores ($r<0.5r_{500}$). In contrast, high-mass clusters present a decreasing
AGN fraction towards the cluster centres. The high AGN fraction in the
outskirts is caused by low-luminosity AGNs. It can be explained by a higher
galaxy merging rate in low-mass clusters, where velocity dispersions are not
high enough to prevent galaxy interactions and merging. Ram pressure stripping
is possible in the cores of all our clusters, but probably stronger in deeper
gravitational potentials. Compared with previous studies of massive or
high-redshift clusters, we conclude that the AGN fraction in cluster galaxies
anti-correlates strongly with cluster mass. The AGN fraction also increases
with redshift, but at the same rate with the respective fraction in field
galaxies.

motions into phases, learning a primitive for each segmented phase of the task,
and reproducing the task by sequencing primitives online based on the learned
model. As compliant motions can ""probe"" the environment, using the interaction
between the robot and the environment to detect phase transitions can make the
transitions less prone to positional errors. This intuition leads us to model a
task with a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (HMM), wherein hidden phase
transition probabilities depend on the interaction with the environment (wrench
measured by an F/T sensor). Expectation-maximization algorithm is employed in
estimating the parameters of the HMM model. During reproduction, the phase
changes of a task are detected online using the forward algorithm, with the
parameters learned from demonstrations. Cartesian impedance controller
parameters are learned from the demonstrations to reproduce each phase of the
task. The proposed approach is studied with a KUKA LWR4+ arm in two setups.
Experiments show that the method can successfully segment and reproduce a task
consisting of compliant motions with one or more demonstrations, even when
demonstrations do not have the same starting position and external forces occur
from different directions. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can also
handle rotational motions.

Golden rule. Our results show that the mean free path depends strongly on the
angle of the incoming neutrino, leading to an asymmetry in this quantity. This
asymmetry depends on the magnetic field intensity and on the density, but it is
rather independent of the temperature. For a density of $0.16$ fm$^{-3}$ at a

convergence of topological correlators in the double-dimer model considered on
Temperleyan approximations $\Omega^\delta$ to a simply connected domain
$\Omega\subset\mathbb C$ we prove the convergence of probabilities of
cylindrical events for the \emph{double-dimer loop ensembles} on
$\Omega^\delta$ as $\delta\to 0$. More precisely, let
$\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n\in\Omega$ and $L$ be a macroscopic lamination on
$\Omega\setminus\{\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n\}$, i.e., a collection of disjoint
simple loops surrounding at least two punctures considered up to homotopies. We
show that the probabilities $P_L^\delta$ that one obtains $L$ after withdrawing
all loops surrounding no more than one puncture from a double-dimer loop
ensemble on $\Omega^\delta$ converge to a conformally invariant limit $P_L$ as
$\delta \to 0$, for each $L$.
  Though our primary motivation comes from 2D statistical mechanics and
probability, the proofs are of a purely analytic nature. The key techniques are
the analysis of entire functions on the representation variety
$\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(\Omega\setminus\{\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n\})\to\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb
C))$ and on its (non-smooth) subvariety of locally unipotent representations.
In particular, we do \emph{not} use any RSW-type arguments for double-dimers.
  The limits $P_L$ of the probabilities $P_L^\delta$ are defined as
coefficients of the isomonodormic tau-function studied by Dub\'edat with
respect to the Fock--Goncharov lamination basis on the representation variety.
The fact that $P_L$ coincides with the probability to obtain $L$ from a sample
of the nested CLE(4) in $\Omega$ requires a small additional input, namely a
mild crossing estimate for this nested conformal loop ensemble.

supervised relation extraction (DS-RE) to distinguish valid from noisy
instances. However, traditional 1-D vector attention models are insufficient
for the learning of different contexts in the selection of valid instances to
predict the relationship for an entity pair. To alleviate this issue, we
propose a novel multi-level structured (2-D matrix) self-attention mechanism
for DS-RE in a multi-instance learning (MIL) framework using bidirectional
recurrent neural networks. In the proposed method, a structured word-level
self-attention mechanism learns a 2-D matrix where each row vector represents a
weight distribution for different aspects of an instance regarding two
entities. Targeting the MIL issue, the structured sentence-level attention
learns a 2-D matrix where each row vector represents a weight distribution on
selection of different valid in-stances. Experiments conducted on two publicly
available DS-RE datasets show that the proposed framework with a multi-level
structured self-attention mechanism significantly outperform state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of PR curves, P@N and F1 measures.

set of normalized bosonic wave-functions obeying a quasiperiodicity condition,
with arbitrary phase $\beta$, along the compactified extra dimension. In this
context, only azimuthal and axial currents densities take place. As to the
azimuthal current, two contributions appear.
  The first one corresponds to the standard azimuthal current in
high-dimensional AdS spacetime with a cosmic string without compactification

itself. The latter is an even function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the
compactified axis and is an odd function of the magnetic flux along its core
with period equal to quantum flux, $\Phi_0=2\pi/e$. On the other hand, the
nonzero axial current density is an even function of the magnetic flux along
the core of the string and an odd function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the
compactified axis. We also find that the axial current density vanishes for
untwisted and twisted bosonic fields in the absence of the magnetic flux

NGC6791. We identify the system to be a blue straggler cluster member by using
a combination of ground-based and Kepler photometry and multi-epoch
spectroscopy. The properties of the primary component are found to be $M_{\rm
p}\sim1.67 \rm M_{\odot}$, more massive than the cluster turn-off, with $R_{\rm
p}\sim1.91 \rm R_{\odot}$ and $T_{\rm eff}=7110\pm100$ K. The secondary
component is highly oversized and overluminous for its low mass with $M_{\rm
s}\sim0.182 \rm M_{\odot}$, $R_{\rm s}\sim0.864 \rm R_{\odot}$ and $T_{\rm
eff}=6875\pm200$ K. We identify this secondary star as a bloated (proto)
extremely low-mass helium white dwarf. These properties of V106 suggest that it
represents a typical Algol-paradox system and that it evolved through a
mass-transfer phase which provides insight into its past evolution. We present
a detailed binary stellar evolution model for the formation of V106 using the
MESA code and find that the mass-transfer phase only ceased about 40 Myr ago.
Due to the short orbital period (P=1.4463 d) another mass-transfer phase is
unavoidable once the current primary star evolves towards the red giant phase.
We argue that V106 will evolve through a common-envelope phase within the next
100 Myr and merge to become a single over-massive giant. The high mass will
make it appear young for its true age, which is revealed by the cluster
properties. Therefore, V106 is potentially a prototype progenitor of old field
giants masquerading as young.

modeled by the dependence on the baryon chemical potential in the exponential

pressures in magnetized SQM are found as functions of the baryon chemical
potential. It is clarified that the central magnetic field strength in a

derivative of the longitudinal pressure with respect to the baryon chemical
potential vanishes first somewhere in the interior of a star under varying the
central field. Above this upper bound, the instability along the magnetic field
is developed in magnetized SQM. The change in the form of the dependence of the
magnetic field strength on the baryon chemical potential between the
exponential and power ones has a nonnegligible effect on the critical magnetic
field strength while the variation of the bag pressure within the absolute

  at 0.2<z<2","Published version",,"10.1093/mnras/stz690",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the fraction of close pairs and morphologically identified
mergers on and above the star-forming main sequence (MS) at 0.2$\leq z\leq$2.0.
The novelty of our work lies in the use of a non-parametric morphological
classification performed on resolved stellar mass maps, reducing the
contamination by non-interacting, high-redshift clumpy galaxies. We find that
the merger fraction rapidly rises to $\geq$70% above the MS, implying that --
already at $z{\gtrsim}1$ -- starburst (SB) events ($\Delta_{\rm MS}\geq$0.6)
are almost always associated with a major merger (1:1 to 1:6 mass ratio). The
majority of interacting galaxies in the SB region are morphologically
disturbed, late-stage mergers. Pair fractions show little dependence on
MS-offset and pairs are more prevalent than late-stage mergers only in the
lower half of the MS. In our sample, major mergers on the MS occur with a
roughly equal frequency of $\sim$5-10% at all masses ${\gtrsim}
10^{10}M_{\odot}$. The MS major merger fraction roughly doubles between $z=0.2$
and $z=2$, with morphological mergers driving the overall increase at
$z{\gtrsim}1$. The differential redshift evolution of interacting pairs and
morphologically classified mergers on the MS can be reconciled by evolving
observability timescales for both pairs and morphological disturbances. The
observed variation of the late-stage merger fraction with $\Delta_{\rm MS}$
follows the perturbative 2-Star Formation Mode model, where any MS galaxy can
experience a continuum of different SFR enhancements. This points to a
starburst-merger connection not only for extreme events, but also more moderate
bursts which merely scatter galaxies upward within the MS, rather than fully
elevating them above it.

the pose difference. The proposed method generates the complete orbit of an
object from a single view of the object with respect to the subgroup of SO(3)
of rotations around the z-axis, and compares the orbit of the object with
another orbit using a novel orbit metric to estimate the pose difference. The
generated orbit in the latent space records all the differences in pose in the
original observational space, and as a result, the method is capable of finding
subtle differences in pose. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on cars, where identifying the subtle pose differences is vital.

active galactic nuclei associated with supermassive black holes accreting at

Gardner and Done (2014; 2018) have predicted their redshift distribution by
appealing to ideas from the spin paradigm in a way that exposes a need for a
deeper discussion on three interrelated issues: (1) an overprediction of BL
Lacs compared to flat spectrum radio quasars; (2) a difference in FSRQ and BL
Lac distributions; (3) a need for powerful but different jets at separated
cosmic times. Beginning with Gardner and Done's determination of Fermi
observable FSRQs based on the distribution of thermal accretion across cosmic
time from the Millennium Simulation, we connect FSRQs to BL Lacs by way of the
gap paradigm for black hole accretion and jet formation to address the above
issues in a unified way. We identify a physical constraint in the paradigm for
the numbers of BL Lacs that naturally leads to separate peaks in time for
different albeit powerful jets. In addition, we both identify as puzzling and
ascribe physical significance to a tail end in the BL Lac curve versus redshift
that is unseen in the redshift distribution for FSRQs.

regarding communications. In the first problem, Alice and Bob each holds a

can recover Alice's string. In the second problem, Alice sends a message with
some redundant information to Bob through a channel that can add adversarial
errors, and the goal is for Bob to correctly recover the message despite the

  In a recent work \cite{CJLW18}, the authors constructed explicit
deterministic document exchange protocols and binary error correcting codes for
edit errors with almost optimal parameters.\ Unfortunately, the constructions
in \cite{CJLW18} do not work for other common errors such as block
transpositions.
  In this paper, we generalize the constructions in \cite{CJLW18} to handle a
much larger class of errors. These include bursts of insertions and deletions,
as well as block transpositions. Specifically, we consider document exchange
and error correcting codes where the total number of block insertions, block
deletions, and block transpositions is at most $k \leq \alpha n/\log n$ for
some constant $0<\alpha<1$. In addition, the total number of bits inserted and
deleted by the first two kinds of operations is at most $t \leq \beta n$ for
some constant $0<\beta<1$, where $n$ is the length of Alice's string or

note that cosmological models with varying couplings suffer from severe
problems with quantum corrections, beyond those shared by all quintessence
models. The vacuum energy depends on all masses and couplings of the theory,
and even small variations of parameters can lead to overwhelmingly large
corrections to the effective potential. We find that quintessence models with
varying parameters can be realised in consistent quantum theories by either: 1)
enforcing exceptional levels of fine-tuning; 2) realising some unknown

turbulent channel flows, where active skin-friction drag reduction techniques
allow a more efficient use of the available power. We study whether the
increased efficiency shows any general trend in how energy is dissipated by the
mean velocity field (mean dissipation) and by the fluctuating velocity field
(turbulent dissipation).
  Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of different control strategies are
performed at Constant Power Input (CPI), so that at statistical equilibrium
each flow (either uncontrolled or controlled by different means) has the same
power input, hence the same global energy flux and, by definition, the same
total energy dissipation rate. The simulations reveal that changes in mean and
turbulent energy dissipation rates can be of either sign in a successfully
controlled flow.
  A quantitative description of these changes is made possible by a new
decomposition of the total dissipation, stemming from an extended Reynolds
decomposition, where the mean velocity is split into a laminar component and a
deviation from it. Thanks to the analytical expressions of the laminar
quantities, exact relationships are derived that link the achieved flow rate
increase and all energy fluxes in the flow system with two wall-normal
integrals of the Reynolds shear stress and the Reynolds number. The dependence
of the energy fluxes on the Reynolds number is elucidated with a simple model
in which the control-dependent changes of the Reynolds shear stress are
accounted for via a modification of the mean velocity profile. The physical
meaning of the energy fluxes stemming from the new decomposition unveils their
inter-relations and connection to flow control, so that a clear target for flow
control can be identified.

collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images,
approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media
services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence
ratings. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true
population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with
higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the

highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly
90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. Similarly, Imgur view

studying a new dimension of political behavior using text analysis. This work
investigates the value of word-level statistical data from the US Congressional

Congress--for studying the ideological positions and behavior of senators.
Applying machine learning techniques, we use this data to automatically
classify senators according to party, obtaining accuracy in the 70-95% range
depending on the specific method used. We also show that using text to predict
DW-NOMINATE scores, a common proxy for ideology, does not improve upon these
already-successful results. This classification deteriorates when applied to
text from sessions of Congress that are four or more years removed from the
training set, pointing to a need on the part of voters to dynamically update
the heuristics they use to evaluate party based on political speech. Text-based
predictions are less accurate than those based on voting behavior, supporting
the theory that roll-call votes represent greater commitment on the part of
politicians and are thus a more accurate reflection of their ideological
preferences. However, the overall success of the machine learning approaches
studied here demonstrates that political speeches are highly predictive of
partisan affiliation. In addition to these findings, this work also introduces

dissipative condensates typically coexist and interact with an incoherent
reservoir, which undermines measurements of key parameters of the condensate.
Here, we overcome this limitation by creating a high-density exciton-polariton
condensate in an optically-induced ""box"" trap. In this so-called Thomas-Fermi
regime, the condensate is fully separated from the reservoir and its behaviour
is dominated by interparticle interactions. We use this regime to directly
measure the polariton-polariton interaction strength, and reduce the existing
uncertainty in its value from four orders of magnitude to within three times
the theoretical prediction. The Thomas-Fermi regime has previously been
demonstrated only in ultracold atomic gases in thermal equilibrium. In a
non-equilibrium exciton-polariton system, this regime offers a novel
opportunity to study interaction-driven effects unmasked by an incoherent
reservoir.

multiple tasks. In order to perform multiple classification tasks with one
neural network model, the losses of each task should be combined. Previous
studies have mostly focused on multiple prediction tasks using joint loss with
static weights for training models, choosing the weights between tasks without
making sufficient considerations by setting them uniformly or empirically. In
this study, we propose a method to calculate joint loss using dynamic weights
to improve the total performance, instead of the individual performance, of
tasks. We apply this method to design an end-to-end multimodal emotion and
gender recognition model using audio and video data. This approach provides
proper weights for the loss of each task when the training process ends. In our
experiments, emotion and gender recognition with the proposed method yielded a
lower joint loss, which is computed as the negative log-likelihood, than using
static weights for joint loss. Moreover, our proposed model has better
generalizability than other models. To the best of our knowledge, this research
is the first to demonstrate the strength of using dynamic weights for joint
loss for maximizing overall performance in emotion and gender recognition
tasks.

hospital and surrounding community that included infants, adults, and
transmission from animal reservoirs. We assessed the role of these transmission
routes in maintaining disease and evaluated the recommended classification
system for hospital and community-acquired CDIs. The reproduction number in the
hospital was <1 (range: 0.16-0.46) for all scenarios. Outside the hospital, the
reproduction number was >1 for nearly all scenarios without transmission from
animal reservoirs (range: 1.0-1.34). However, the reproduction number for the
human population was <1 if a minority (>3.5-26.0%) of human exposures
originated from animal reservoirs. Symptomatic adults accounted for <10%
transmission in the community. Under conservative assumptions, infants
accounted for 17% of community transmission. An estimated 33-40% of
community-acquired cases were reported but 28-39% of these reported cases were
misclassified as hospital-acquired by recommended definitions. Transmission
could be plausibly sustained by asymptomatically colonized adults and infants
in the community or exposure to animal reservoirs, but not hospital
transmission alone. Underreporting of community-onset cases and systematic
misclassification underplays the role of community transmission.

laboratory to explore large etendue observations from cadences of about 0.1
days and to test new computational tools for the analysis of large data. This
work follows a fully \textit{Data Science} approach: from the raw data to the
analysis and classification of variable sources. We compile a catalog of
${\sim}15$ million object detections and a catalog of ${\sim}2.5$ million
light-curves classified by variability. The typical depth of the survey is
$24.2$, $24.3$, $24.1$ and $23.8$ in $u$, $g$, $r$ and $i$ bands, respectively.
We classified all point-like non-moving sources by first extracting features
from their light-curves and then applying a Random Forest classifier. For the
classification, we used a training set constructed using a combination of
cross-matched catalogs, visual inspection, transfer/active learning and data
augmentation. The classification model consists of several Random Forest
classifiers organized in a hierarchical scheme. The classifier accuracy
estimated on a test set is approximately $97\%$. In the unlabeled data,
$3\,485$ sources were classified as variables, of which $1\,321$ were
classified as periodic. Among the periodic classes we discovered with high
confidence, 1 $\delta$-scutti, 39 eclipsing binaries, 48 rotational variables
and 90 RR-Lyrae and for the non-periodic classes we discovered 1 cataclysmic
variables, 630 QSO, and 1 supernova candidates. The first data release can be

size-luminosity relation of the LAEs monotonically decreases towards high-z,
following size-luminosity relations of SFGs and LBGs. The median r_e values of
the LAEs significantly evolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.37, similar to those of the SFGs

evolution made by previous studies whose LAE samples are probably biased to
faint sources at low-z. The r_e distribution, star-formation rate surface
densities, and stellar-to-halo size ratios of the LAEs are comparable with
those of the SFGs and LBGs, indicating that LAEs have stellar components
similar to SFGs and LBGs with a Lya emissivity controlled by the non-stellar

or particle loss, limiting the efficiency of processes. Dissipation can also
lead to the formation of dissipative structures or induce quantum decoherence.
Quantum decoherence and dissipation are critical for quantum information
processing. On the one hand, such effects can make achieving quantum
computation much harder, but on the other hand, dissipation can promote quantum
coherence and offer control over the system. It is the latter avenue -- how
dissipation can be exploited to promote coherence in a quantum system -- that
is explored in this work. We report the exploration of dissipation in a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of spin-2 87Rb atoms. Through experiments and
numerical simulations, we show that spin-dependent particle dissipation can
give rise to quantum coherence and lead to the spontaneous formation of a
magnetic eigenstate. Although the interactions between the atomic spins are not
ferromagnetic, the spin-dependent dissipation enhances the synchronization of
the relative phases among five magnetic sublevels, and this effects promotes
magnetization.

promising directions of semantic parsing. Firstly, our model uses a semantic
graph to represent the meaning of a sentence, which has a tight-coupling with
knowledge bases. Secondly, by leveraging the powerful representation learning
and prediction ability of neural network models, we propose a RNN model which
can effectively map sentences to action sequences for semantic graph
generation. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on OVERNIGHT dataset and gets competitive performance on GEO and
ATIS datasets.

semantic segmentation, we propose a deep smoke segmentation network to infer
high quality segmentation masks from blurry smoke images. To overcome large
variations in texture, color and shape of smoke appearance, we divide the
proposed network into a coarse path and a fine path. The first path is an
encoder-decoder FCN with skip structures, which extracts global context
information of smoke and accordingly generates a coarse segmentation mask. To
retain fine spatial details of smoke, the second path is also designed as an
encoder-decoder FCN with skip structures, but it is shallower than the first
path network. Finally, we propose a very small network containing only add,
convolution and activation layers to fuse the results of the two paths. Thus,
we can easily train the proposed network end to end for simultaneous
optimization of network parameters. To avoid the difficulty in manually
labelling fuzzy smoke objects, we propose a method to generate synthetic smoke
images. According to results of our deep segmentation method, we can easily and
accurately perform smoke detection from videos. Experiments on three synthetic
smoke datasets and a realistic smoke dataset show that our method achieves much
better performance than state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms based on FCNs.
Test results of our method on videos are also appealing.

of reflectance from the array is achieved with appropriate lattice spacing

demonstrate that generalized Kerker condition is satisfied in this case, and
hBN antennas in the array efficiently scatter light in the predominantly

matrix infinitely divisible (i.d.) series, which is a finite sum of fixed
matrices weighted by i.d. random variables. We obtain several types of tail
inequalities, including Bennett-type and Bernstein-type inequalities. This
allows us to further bound the expectation of the spectral norm of a matrix
i.d. series. Moreover, by developing a new lower-bound function for
$Q(s)=(s+1)\log(s+1)-s$ that appears in the Bennett-type inequality, we derive
a tighter tail inequality of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix i.d. series
than the Bernstein-type inequality when the matrix dimension is high. The
resulting lower-bound function is of independent interest and can improve any
Bennett-type concentration inequality that involves the function $Q(s)$. The
class of i.d. probability distributions is large and includes Gaussian and
Poisson distributions, among many others. Therefore, our results encompass the
existing work \cite{tropp2012user} on matrix Gaussian series as a special case.
Lastly, we show that the tail inequalities of a matrix i.d. series have
applications in several optimization problems including the chance constrained
optimization problem and the quadratic optimization problem with orthogonality
constraints. In addition, we also use the resulting tail bounds to show that
random matrices constructed from i.d. random variables satisfy the restricted

In this work, we introduce novel plasmonic structures consisting of
nanoantennas (nanoprisms, single bowtie nanoantennas and double bowtie
nanoantennas) integrated in the center of ring diffraction gratings.
Propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are generated by the ring grating
and coupled with localized surface plasmons (LSPs) at the nanoantennas exciting
emitters placed in their gap. SPPs are widely used for optical waveguiding but
provide low resolution due to their weak spatial confinement. Oppositely, LSPs
provide excellent sub-wavelength confinement but induce large losses. The
phenomenon of SPP-LSP coupling witnessed in our structures allows achieving
more precise focusing at the nanoscale, causing an increase in the fluorescence
emission of the emitters. FDTD simulations as well as experimental fabrication
and optical characterization results are presented to study plasmon-emitter
coupling between an ensemble of dye molecules and our integrated plasmonic

has also seen some progress. The most physically relevant case of $d=2$,
however, is not very well-understood mathematically, largely due to the
renormalization that is required: in the language of renormalization group
analysis, the $d=2$ case is neither ultraviolet superrenormalizable like the
$d=1$ case nor infrared superrenormalizable like the $d\ge 3$ case. Moreover,
unlike in $d=1$, the Cole-Hopf transform is not directly usable in $d=2$

distributions rather than functions. In this article we show the existence of
subsequential scaling limits as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of Cole-Hopf solutions of
the $(2+1)$-dimensional KPZ equation with white noise mollified to spatial
scale $\varepsilon$ and nonlinearity multiplied by the vanishing factor
$|\log\varepsilon|^{-1/2}$. We also show that the scaling limits obtained in
this way do not coincide with solutions to the linearized equation, meaning
that the nonlinearity has a non-vanishing effect. We thus propose our scaling

beneficial in small amounts but detrimental in excess. The reasons are not
fully known but questions have been asked about the stability of insulin
oligomers in the presence of ethanol. We compute the free energy surface (FES)
and the pathway of insulin dimer dissociation in water and in 5% and 10%
water-ethanol mixture. We find that in the presence of ethanol the barrier
energy of dissociation reaction decreases by about 40% even in 5% water-ethanol
solution. In addition, ethanol induces a significant change in the reaction
pathway. We obtain estimates of the rate of reaction and binding energy for all
the three systems and those agree well with the previous experimental results
for the insulin dimer dissociation in water. The computed FES in water exhibits
ruggedness due to the existence of a number of intermediate states surrounded
by high and broad transition state region. However, the presence of ethanol
smoothens out the ruggedness. We extracted the conformations of the
intermediate states along the minimum energy pathway in all the three systems
and analyzed the change in microscopic structures in the presence of ethanol.
Interestingly, we discover a stable intermediate state in water-ethanol
mixtures where the monomers are separated (center-to-center) by about 3 nm and
the contact order parameter is close to zero. This intermediate is stabilized
by the distribution of ethanol and water molecules at the interface and which,
significantly, serves to reduce the dissociation rate constant .The solvation
of the two monomers during the dissociation and proteins' departure from native
state configuration are analyzed to obtain insight into the dimer dissociation
processes.

extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is
fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental
models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number for populations
with local person-to-person transmission and exposure from some other source:
either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a
reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become
extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported
cases (since $R_0<1$), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that
many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show
that in the simplest case, $R_0<1$ if and only if the proportion of infections
acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore
how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect
this rule. We apply these rules in two cases studies of Clostridium difficile
infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for
imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for
exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted,
highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction
number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was
sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue
that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0%
of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.

However, without a tunable environment it is challenging to resolve the Lamb

inhomogeneous fissile medium. Whilst well treated in the nuclear physics
literature (cf. [9, 27]), the NTE has had a somewhat scattered treatment in
mathematical literature with a variety of different approaches (cf. [8, 25]).
Within a probabilistic framework it has somewhat undeservingly received little
attention in recent years; nonetheless, probabilistic treatments can be found
see for example [19, 26, 24, 29, 4, 3]. In this article our aim is threefold.
First we want to introduce a slightly more general setting for the NTE, which
gives a more complete picture of the different species of particle and
radioactive fluxes that are involved in fission. Second we consolidate the
classical c0-semigroup approach to solving the NTE with the method of
stochastic representation which involves expectation semigroups. Third we
provide the leading asymptotic of our multi-species NTE, which will turn out to
be crucial for further stochastic analysis of the NTE in forthcoming work [6,
5]. The methodology used in this paper harmonises the culture of expectation
semigroup analysis from the theory of stochastic processes against c0-semigroup
theory from functional analysis. In this respect, our presentation is thus part
review of existing theory and part presentation of new research results based
on generalisation of existing results.

lattice atomic layers (TLAL) on the surface of SiC(0001) semiconductor. The
possibility of such layers formation and their properties have not been
addressed before. Here we show, that these layers may indeed be stable and,
owing to peculiar bonding configuration, exhibit robust Dirac-like energy bands
originating from $p_x+p_y$ orbitals and localized mostly within the layer, and
$p_z$ band localized outside the layer and interacting with SiC substrate. We
found that a $T_1$ adsorption site is most favorable for such TLAL structure
and this results in an unusual SOC-induced spin polarization of the states
around $\bar{K}$ points of Brillouin zone, namely the coexistence of Rashba-

phenomena in terms of symmetry of partial electronic density rather than

enhanced by establishing a large scale circulation flow by means of small

are derived for the throughput assuming peak power and peak interference

various dielectric environments are studied.
  The screened hydrogen model (SHM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 056401 (2016)] is
examined by comparing its exciton spectra with the radial equation (RE)
solutions. While the SHM is found to describe the nonhydrogenic exciton Rydberg
series reasonably well, it fails to account for the linear decrease of the
exciton energy with the orbital quantum number $m$. The exciton Bohr orbit
shrinks as $\lvert m\rvert$ becomes larger resulting in increased strength of
the electron-hole interaction and a decrease of the exciton energy. The exciton
effective radius expression of the SHM can characterize the exciton radius's
dependence on $n$, but it cannot properly describe the exciton radius's
dependence on $m$, which is the cause of the SHM's poor description of the
exciton energy's $m$-dependence. For monolayer WS$_2$ on the SiO$_2$ substrate,
our calculated $s$ exciton Rydberg series agrees closely with that measured by
optical reflection spectroscopy [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 076802 (2014)], while
the calculated $p$ excitons offer an explanation for the two broad features of
a two-photon absorption spectrum [Nature 513, 214 (2014)]. Our calculated
exciton energies for monolayer TMDs in various dielectric environments compare
favourably with experimental data. Variational wave functions are obtained for
a number of strongly bound exciton states and further used to study the Stark
effects in monolayer TMDs, an analytical expression being deduced which yields
a redshift of the ground state energy to a good accuracy. The numerical
solution of the RE combined with the variational method provides a simple and

of these results is to consider the case of nonzero black hole charge. In
addition we have explored a large set of coupling functions between the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant and the scalar field, that was not done until now even
in the uncharged case, in order to understand better the behavior of the
solutions and the deviations from pure general relativity. The results show
that in the case of nonzero black hole charge two bifurcation points can exist
- one at larger masses where the scalarized solutions bifurcated from the
Reissner-Nordstrom one, and one at smaller masses where the scalar charge of
the solutions decreases again to zero and the branch merges again with the GR
one. All of the constructed scalarized branches do not reach an extremal limit.
We have examined the entropy of the black holes with nontrivial scalar field
and it turns out, that similar to the uncharged case, the fundamental branch
which possesses scalar field with no nodes is thermodynamically favorable over
the Reissner-Nordstrom one for the considered coupling functions, while the
rest of the branches possessing scalar field with one or more zeros have lower
entropy compared to the GR case and they are supposed to be unstable.

that although the integral equations of the BEM are not convolutions over

is one dimension higher than that of the boundary. Therefore, the FFT can
indeed be used to calculate the BEM integral equations on arbitrary shapes,

domain by transferring the knowledge of the labeled source domain. To date,
most of the existing works focus on the scenario of one source domain and one
target domain (1S1T), and just a few works concern the scenario of multiple
source domains and one target domain (mS1T). While, to the best of our
knowledge, almost no work concerns the scenario of one source domain and
multiple target domains (1SmT), in which these unlabeled target domains may not
necessarily share the same categories, therefore, contrasting to mS1T, 1SmT is
more challenging. Accordingly, for such a new UDA scenario, we propose a UDA
framework through the model parameter adaptation (PA-1SmT). A key ingredient of
PA-1SmT is to transfer knowledge through adaptive learning of a common model
parameter dictionary, which is completely different from existing popular
methods for UDA, such as subspace alignment, distribution matching etc., and
can also be directly used for DA of privacy protection due to the fact that the
knowledge is transferred just via the model parameters rather than data itself.
Finally, our experimental results on three domain adaptation benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Larger offsets indicate that the far-infrared (FIR) emission detected by

non-monotonic. Indeed, most proposals for structured argumentation use a
monotonic base logic (e.g. some form of modus ponens with a rule-based
language, or classical logic). Nonetheless, there are issues in capturing
defeasible reasoning in argumentation including choice of base logic and
modelling of defeasible knowledge. And there are insights and tools to be
harnessed for research in non-monontonic logics. We consider some of these
issues in this paper.

information on dust and the role of magnetic fields in cloud evolution. With
observations of a dense filamentary cloud G035.39-00.33, we aim to characterise
the dust emission properties and the variations of the polarisation fraction.
JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 data at 850um are combined with Planck 850um (353GHz) data
to map polarisation fractions. With previous SCUBA-2 observations (450um and
850um) and Herschel data, the column densities are determined via modified
blackbody fits and via radiative transfer modelling. Models are constructed to
examine how the polarisation angles and fractions depend on potential magnetic
field geometries and grain alignment. POL-2 data show clear changes in the
magnetic field orientation. The filament has a peak column density of N(H2)~7
10^22 cm-2, a minimum dust temperature of T~12 K, and a mass of some 4300Msun
for the area N(H2)> 5 10^21 cm-2. The estimated average value of the dust
opacity spectral index is beta ~ 1.9. The ratio of sub-millimetre and J band
optical depths is tau(250 um)/tau(J) ~ 2.5 10^-3, more than four times the
typical values for diffuse medium. The polarisation fraction decreases as a
function of column density to p ~ 1% in the central filament. Because of noise,
the observed decrease of p(N) is significant only at N(H2)>2 10^22 cm-2. The
observations suggest that the grain alignment is not constant. Although the
data can be explained with a complete loss of alignment at densities above ~
10^4 cm-3 or using the predictions of radiative torques alignment, the
uncertainty of the field geometry and the spatial filtering of the SCUBA-2 data
prevent strong conclusions. G035.39-00.33 shows strong signs of dust evolution
and the low polarisation fraction is suggestive of a loss of polarised emission
from its densest parts.

high-order discontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods for scale resolving simulations
of turbulent flows. Nevertheless, in the context of incompressible flow
computations, the computational expense of solving large scale equation systems
characterized by indefinite Jacobian matrices has often prevented from dealing
with industrially-relevant computations. In this work we seek to improve the
efficiency of Rosenbrock-type linearly-implicit Runge-Kutta methods by devising
robust, scalable and memory-lean solution strategies. In particular, we
introduce memory saving p-multigrid preconditioners coupling matrix-free and
matrix-based Krylov iterative smoothers. The p-multigrid preconditioner relies
on cheap block-diagonal smoother's preconditioners on the fine space to reduce
assembly costs and memory allocation, and ensures an adequate resolution of the
coarsest space of the multigrid iteration using Additive Schwarz precondioned
smoothers to obtain satisfactory convergence rates and optimal parallel
efficiency of the method. Extensive numerical validation is performed. The
Rosenbrock formulation is applied to test cases of growing complexity: the
laminar unsteady flow around a two-dimensional cylinder at Re=200 and around a
sphere at Re=300, the transitional flow problem of the ERCOFTAC T3L test case
suite with different levels of free-stream turbulence. As proof of concept, the
numerical solution of the Boeing Rudimentary Landing Gear test case at Re=10^6
is reported. A good agreement of the solutions with experimental data is
documented, as well as strong memory savings and execution time gains with
respect to state-of-the art solution strategies.

a closed oriented surface $\Sigma$ with $\textrm{genus}(\Sigma) \geq 2$. This
embeds naturally into the cotangent bundle $T^*\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$ of
Teichm\""uller space or can be identified with the almost-Fuchsian moduli space
associated to $\Sigma$. The later is the moduli space of quasi-Fuchsian
threefolds which contain a unique incompressible minimal surface with principal
curvatures in $(-1,1)$.
  Donaldson outlined various remarkable properties of this moduli space for
which we provide complete proofs in this paper: On the cotangent-bundle of
Teichm\""uller space, the hyperk\""ahler structure on $\mathcal{M}$ can be viewed
as the Feix--Kaledin hyperk\""ahler extension of the Weil--Petersson metric. The
almost-Fuchsian moduli space embeds into the
$\textrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-representation variety of $\Sigma$ and the
hyperk\""ahler structure on $\mathcal{M}$ extends the Goldman holomorphic
symplectic structure. Here the natural complex structure corresponds to the
second complex structure in the first picture. Moreover, the area of the
minimal surface in an almost-Fuchsian manifold provides a K\""ahler potential
for the hyperk\""ahler metric.
  The various identifications are obtained using the work of Uhlenbeck on germs
of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds, an explicit map from $\mathcal{M}$ to
$\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)\times \bar{\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)}$ found by Hodge, the
simultaneous uniformization theorem of Bers, and the theory of Higgs bundles

Fresnel diffraction from a phase step to the realm of quantitative phase
imaging. By employing Fresnel diffraction of a divergent (or convergent) beam
of light from a plane-parallel phase plate, we provide a viable, simple and
compact platform for three-dimensional imaging of micron-sized specimens. The
recorded diffraction pattern of the outgoing light from an imaging system in
the vicinity of the plate edge can be served as a hologram, which would be
analyzed via Fourier transform method to measure the sample phase information.
The period of diffraction fringes is adjustable simply by rotating the plate
without the reduction of both field of view and fringe contrast. The high
stability of the presented method is affirmatively confirmed through comparison
the result with that of conventional Mach-Zehnder based digital holographic
method. Quantitative phase measurements on silica microspheres, onion skin and
red blood cells ensure the validity of the method and its ability for
monitoring nanometer-scale fluctuations of living cells, particularly in

the presence of warm dust, while the central stars are too hot to be in a
dust-production evolutionary phase. This allows for an efficient detection of
binary post-AGB candidates. It is now well established that the near-infrared
excess is produced by the inner rim of a stable dusty disc that surrounds the
binary system. These discs are scaled-up versions of protoplanetary discs and
form a second generation of stable Keplerian discs. They are likely formed
during a binary interaction process when the primary was on ascending the AGB.
I will summarise what we have learned from the observational properties of
these post-AGB binaries. The impact of the creation, lifetime and evolution of
the circumbinary discs on the evolution of the system are yet to be fully

we consider private information retrieval (PIR) of content from a library of

to learn any information about which file she is interested in. To reduce the
backhaul usage, content is cached at the wireless edge in a number of
small-cell base stations (SBSs) using maximum distance separable codes. We
propose a PIR scheme for this scenario that achieves privacy against a number
of spy SBSs that (possibly) collaborate. The proposed PIR scheme is an
extension of a recently introduced scheme by Kumar et al. to the case of
multiple code rates, suitable for the scenario where files have different
popularities. We then derive the backhaul rate and optimize the content
placement to minimize it. We prove that uniform content placement is optimal,
i.e., all files that are cached should be stored using the same code rate. This
is in contrast to the case where no PIR is required. Furthermore, we show
numerically that popular content placement is optimal for some scenarios.

considered that the absence of strong pulsations is also related to the
evolution status of the star. Further, its periodogram shows low-frequency
peaks. If these oscillations are g-modes, V775 Tau can be thought to be one of
the rare stars that show all $\gamma$ Dor, $\delta$ Scuti and Am type
variations. V483 Tau is comparatively more luminous, hotter and has higher
rotational velocity. Therefore, although it shares the same region with V775
Tau in the H-R diagram, it is not considered to be an Am star. Yet, it exactly
overlaps with the $\gamma\,$ Dor stars. These clues as well as g-modes detected

expand along the trajectory, and using kinetic simulations, we explore the
expansion as the electrons propagate away from the Sun. Specifically, we
investigate the front, peak and back of the electron beam in space from derived
radio brightness temperatures of fundamental type III emission. The front of
the electron beams travelled at speeds from 0.2c--0.7c, significantly faster
than the back of the beam that travelled between 0.12c--0.35c. The difference
in speed between the front and the back elongates the electron beams in time.
The rate of beam elongation has a 0.98 correlation coefficient with the peak
velocity; in-line with predictions from type III observations. The inferred
speeds of electron beams initially increase close to the acceleration region
and then decrease through the solar corona. Larger starting densities and
harder initial spectral indices result in longer and faster type III sources.
Faster electron beams have higher beam energy densities, produce type IIIs with
higher peak brightness temperatures and shorter FWHM durations. Higher
background plasma temperatures also increase speeds, particularly at the back
of the beam. We show how our predictions of electron beam evolution influences
type III bandwidth and drift-rates. Our radial predictions of electron beam
speed and expansion can be tested by the upcoming in situ electron beam

procedure subject to wave-equation constraint. FWI is highly nonlinear when the
wave-equation constraint is enforced at each iteration. To mitigate
nonlinearity, wavefield-reconstruction inversion (WRI) expands the search space
by relaxing the wave-equation constraint with a penalty method. The pitfall of
this approach resides in the tuning of the penalty parameter because increasing
values should be used to foster data fitting during early iterations while
progressively enforcing the wave-equation constraint during late iterations.
However, large values of penalty parameter lead to ill-conditioned problems.
Here, this tuning issue is solved by replacing the penalty method by an
augmented Lagrangian method equipped with operator splitting (IR-WRI as
iteratively-refined WRI). It is shown that IR-WRI is similar to a penalty
method in which data and sources are updated at each iteration by the running
sum of the data and source residuals of previous iterations. Moreover, the
alternating direction strategy exploits the bilinearity of the wave equation
constraint to linearize the subsurface model estimation around the
reconstructed wavefield. Accordingly, the original nonlinear FWI is decomposed
into a sequence of two linear subproblems, the optimization variable of one
subproblem being passed as a passive variable for the next subproblem. The
convergence of WRI and IR-WRI are first compared with a simple transmission
experiment, which lies in the linear regime of FWI. Under the same conditions,
IR-WRI converges to a more accurate minimizer with a smaller number of
iterations than WRI. More realistic case studies performed with the Marmousi II
and the BP salt models show the resilience of IR-WRI to cycle skipping and
noise.

with electrolytes, such polar surfaces can be stabilized by adsorption of
counter ions from solution to form electric double layers (EDLs). In a previous
work (J. Chem. Phys 147, 104702 (2017)) we reported on a classical force field
based molecular dynamics study of a prototype model system namely a NaCl(111)
slab interfaced with an aqueous NaCl solution on both sides. A serious hurdle
in the simulation is that the finite width of the slab admits an electric field
in the solid perturbing the theoretical charge balance at the interface of
semi-infinite systems (half the surface charge density for NaCl(111)). It was
demonstrated that the application of a finite macroscopic field $E$ cancelling
the internal electric field can recover the correct charge compensation at the
interface. In the present work, we expand this method by applying a conjugate
electric displacement field $D$. The benefits of using $D$ instead of $E$ as
the control variable are two fold: it does not only speed up the convergence of
the polarization in the simulation but also leads to a succinct expression for
the biasing displacement field involving only structural parameters which are
known in advance. This makes it feasible to study the charge compensating
phenomenon of this prototype system with density functional theory based
molecular dynamics (DFTMD), as shown in this work.

variability is currently unclear. Some solar-cycle variations of the quiet-Sun
physical structure, such as the temperature gradient, might affect the
irradiance. The synoptic measurement of this quantity along the activity cycle
would improve our understanding of long-term irradiance variations. Aims. We
intend to test a method previously introduced for measuring the photospheric
temperature gradient from high-resolution spectroscopic observation and to
study its feasibility with ground-based instruments with and without adaptative
optics. Methods. We used synthetic profiles of the FeI 630.15 nm obtained from
realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the photospheric
granulation and line radiative transfer computations under local
thermodynamical equilibrium conditions. Synthetic granulation images at
different levels in the line are obtained by convolution with the instrumental
point spread function (PSF) under various conditions of atmospheric turbulence,
with and without correction by an adaptative optics (AO) system. The PSF are
obtained with the PAOLA software, and the AO performances are inspired by the
system that will be operating on the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. Results.
We consider two different conditions of atmospheric turbulence, with Fried
parameters of 7 cm and 5 cm, respectively. We show that the degraded images
lead to both a bias and a loss of precision in the temperature-gradient
measurement, and that the correction with the AO system allows us to
drastically improve the measurement quality. Conclusions. Long-term synoptic
observations of the temperature gradient in the solar photosphere can be
undertaken by implement- ing this method on ground-based solar telescopes that
are equipped with an AO correction system.

donor and acceptor in all-polymer solar cells. The formation of a stable CT
state is found to be sensitive to the distance between two oppositely charged
polarons and the relevant critical electrostatic potential is thus quantified.
In order to get insight into the dependence of dissociation of CT state on the
width of interfacial layer, two quantities are calculated: One is the Coulomb
capture radius between two polarons and the other is the quantum trace distance
which serves as the fingerprint of the quantum coherence between them. The
dissociation of CT state is found to take place within an ultrafast timescale

that appears to play a central role in nociceptive signaling in inflammatory
and neuropathic pain. However, little is known about the peptide in
cancer-induced bone pain. Here, we evaluate the role of spinal NPY in the
MRMT-1 rat model of cancer-induced bone pain. Our studies revealed an
up-regulation of NPY-immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of cancer-bearing rats
17 days after inoculation, which could be a compensatory antinociceptive
response. Consistent with this interpretation, intrathecal administration of
NPY to rats with cancer-induced bone pain caused a reduction in nociceptive
behaviors that lasted up to 150 min. This effect was diminished by both Y1
(BIBO3304) and Y2 (BIIE0246) receptor antagonists, indicating that both
receptors participate in mediating the antinociceptive effect of NPY. Y1 and Y2
receptor binding in the spinal cord was unchanged in the cancer state as

communication networks, VLSI design, graphics, and several others, require
dynamic modifications -- addition and removal of vertices and/or edges -- in
the graph. This paper presents a novel concurrent non-blocking algorithm to
implement a dynamic unbounded directed graph in a shared-memory machine. The
addition and removal operations of vertices and edges are lock-free. For a
finite sized graph, the lookup operations are wait-free. Most significant
component of the presented algorithm is the reachability query in a concurrent
graph. The reachability queries in our algorithm are obstruction-free and thus
impose minimal additional synchronization cost over other operations. We prove
that each of the data structure operations are linearizable. We extensively
evaluate a sample C/C++ implementation of the algorithm through a number of
micro-benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
scales well with the number of threads and on an average provides 5 to 7x
performance improvement over a concurrent graph implementation using
coarse-grained locking.

However, the performance on the real image often drops significantly because of
the domain shift between the synthetic data and the real images. In this
setting, domain adaptation brings an appealing option. The effective approaches
of domain adaptation shape the representations that (1) are discriminative for
the main task and (2) have good generalization capability for domain shift. To
this end, we propose a novel loss function, i.e., Conservative Loss, which
penalizes the extreme good and bad cases while encouraging the moderate
examples. More specifically, it enables the network to learn features that are
discriminative by gradient descent and are invariant to the change of domains
via gradient ascend method. Extensive experiments on synthetic to real
segmentation adaptation show our proposed method achieves state of the art
results. Ablation studies give more insights into properties of the
Conservative Loss. Exploratory experiments and discussion demonstrate that our
Conservative Loss has good flexibility rather than restricting an exact form.

further elucidate the properties of display graphs and their interaction with

show that if a phylogenetic network displays (i.e. topologically embeds) a

function of the treewidth of the original network (and also by various other
parameters). In fact, using a bramble argument we show that this treewidth
bound is sharp up to an additive term of 1. We leverage this bound to give an
FPT algorithm, parameterized by treewidth, for determining whether a network
displays a tree, which is an intensively-studied problem in the field. We

action which were not identified yet, one related to time-dependent (or
time-gauged) shifts of the response fields and existing in both 2D and 3D, and
the other to time-gauged rotations and specific to 2D flows. We derive the
corresponding Ward identities, and exploit them within the non-perturbative
renormalization group formalism, and the large wave-number expansion scheme
developed in [Phys. Fluids {\bf 30}, 055102 (2018)]. We consider the flow
equation for a generalized $n$-point correlation function, and calculate its
leading order term in the large wave-number expansion. At this order, the
resulting flow equation can be closed exactly. We solve the fixed point
equation for the 2-point function, which yields its explicit time dependence,
for both small and large time delays in the stationary turbulent state. On the
other hand, at equal times, the leading order term vanishes, so we compute the

Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age difference in the solar
annulus between two distinct sequences in the [$\alpha$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]
abundance ratios relation: the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ stellar
populations. We aim at reproducing these new data with chemical evolution
models including different assumptions for the history and number of accretion
events. We tested two different approaches: a revised version of the
`two-infall' model where the high-$\alpha$ phase forms by a fast gas accretion
episode and the low-$\alpha$ sequence follows later from a slower gas infall
rate, and the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form
coevally and independently. The revised `two-infall' model including
uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the
[$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic epochs, ii)
the age$-$metallicity relation and the time evolution [$\alpha$/Fe]; iii) the
age distribution of the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ stellar populations, iv)
the metallicity distribution function. The parallel approach is not capable of
properly reproduce the stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. In
conclusion, the best chemical evolution model is the revised `two-infall' one,
where a consistent delay of $\sim$4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas
accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar abundances and
ages.

aggregation scheme named \emph{object context}, which focuses on enhancing the
role of object information. Motivated by the fact that the category of each
pixel is inherited from the object it belongs to, we define the object context
for each pixel as the set of pixels that belong to the same category as the
given pixel in the image. We use a binary relation matrix to represent the
relationship between all pixels, where the value one indicates the two selected
pixels belong to the same category and zero otherwise.
  We propose to use a dense relation matrix to serve as a surrogate for the
binary relation matrix. The dense relation matrix is capable to emphasize the
contribution of object information as the relation scores tend to be larger on
the object pixels than the other pixels. Considering that the dense relation
matrix estimation requires quadratic computation overhead and memory
consumption w.r.t. the input size, we propose an efficient interlaced sparse
self-attention scheme to model the dense relations between any two of all
pixels via the combination of two sparse relation matrices.
  To capture richer context information, we further combine our interlaced
sparse self-attention scheme with the conventional multi-scale context schemes
including pyramid pooling~\citep{zhao2017pyramid} and atrous spatial pyramid
pooling~\citep{chen2018deeplab}. We empirically show the advantages of our
approach with competitive performances on five challenging benchmarks

constrained by measuring the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ($A_{LL}$) of
jet production and neutral pions. Global QCD analyses of polarized parton
distribution functions, which include the 2009 $A_{LL}$ STAR results for
inclusive jet production at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, provide evidence of a non-zero
gluon polarization in the measured range of partonic momentum fraction $x >

result by Lyapunov guarantees the existence of an analytic manifold of periodic
orbits tangent to any two-dimensional, elliptic eigenspace of a fixed point
satisfying nonresonance conditions. These two dimensional manifolds are
referred as Lyapunov Subcenter Manifolds (LSM).
  Numerical and experimental observations in the nonlinear vibrations
literature suggest that LSM's often persist under autonomous, dissipative
perturbations. These perturbed manifolds are useful since they provide
information of the asymptotics of the convergence to equilibrium.
  In this paper, we formulate and prove precise mathematical results on the
persistence of LSM under dissipation.
  We show that, under mild non-degeneracy conditions on the perturbation, for
small enough dissipation, there are analytic invariant manifolds of the
perturbed system that approximate (in the analytic sense) the LSM in a fixed
neighborhood. We also provide examples that show that some non-degeneracy
conditions on the perturbations are needed for the results to hold true.
  We also study the dependence of the manifolds on the dissipation parameter.
If $\varepsilon$ is the dissipation parameter, we show that the manifolds are
real analytic in $(-\varepsilon_0, \varepsilon_0) \setminus \{0\} $ and
$C^\infty $ in $(-\varepsilon_0, \varepsilon_0)$. We construct explicit
asymptotic expansions in powers of $\varepsilon$ (which presumably do not
converge).

using a single framework that leads to simpler proofs. In this genre of
problems, the input is a metric space $(X,d)$ (possibly arising from a graph)
and a subset of terminals $K\subset X$, and the goal is to partition the points
$X$ such that each part, called a cluster, contains exactly one terminal
(possibly with connectivity requirements) so as to minimize some objective. The
three bounds we reprove are for Steiner Point Removal on trees [Gupta, SODA
2001], for Metric $0$-Extension in bounded doubling dimension [Lee and Naor,
unpublished 2003], and for Connected Metric $0$-Extension [Englert et al.,
SICOMP 2014].
  A natural approach is to cluster each point with its closest terminal, which
would partition $X$ into so-called Voronoi cells, but this approach can fail
miserably due to its stringent cluster boundaries. A now-standard fix, which we
call the Relaxed-Voronoi framework, is to use enlarged Voronoi cells, but to
obtain disjoint clusters, the cells are computed greedily according to some
order. This method, first proposed by Calinescu, Karloff and Rabani [SICOMP
2004], was employed successfully to provide state-of-the-art results for
terminal-clustering problems on general metrics. However, for restricted
families of metrics, e.g., trees and doubling metrics, only more complicated,
ad-hoc algorithms are known. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that the
Relaxed-Voronoi algorithm is applicable to restricted metrics, and actually
leads to relatively simple algorithms and analyses.

Comparative experiments conducted on common benchmarking datasets confirm that
our function is more robust to noise that affects the rotational component of
the pose measurements and, thus, exhibits a larger convergence basin than the

discovered by the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), an all-Northern-sky
survey for pulsars and fast transients at a central observing frequency of 135
MHz. We subsequently detected pulsations from the pulsar in the interferometric
images of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, allowing for sub-arcsecond
localization. This, along with a pre-discovery detection 2 years prior, allowed
us to measure the spin-period derivative to be $\dot{P}=2.7 \times 10^{-14}$ s
s$^{-1}$. The observed spin period derivative of PSR J0250+5854 indicates a
surface magnetic field strength, characteristic age and spin-down luminosity of
$2.6 \times 10^{13}$G, $13.7$ Myr and $8.2 \times 10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$
respectively, for a dipolar magnetic field configuration. This also places the
pulsar beyond the conventional pulsar death line, where radio emission is
expected to cease. The spin period of PSR J0250+5854 is similar to those of the
high-energy-emitting magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs).
However, the pulsar was not detected by the Swift/XRT in the energy band of
0.3-10 keV, placing a bolometric luminosity limit of $1.5 \times 10^{32}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ for an assumed $N_{\rm H}=1.35\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a
temperature of 85 eV (typical of XDINSs). We discuss the implications of the
discovery for models of the pulsar death line as well as the prospect of
finding more similarly long-period pulsars, including the advantages provided
by LOTAAS for this.

which multiple single-antenna mobile users running applications featuring
shared data can choose between (partially) offloading their individual tasks to
a nearby single-antenna cloudlet for remote execution and performing pure local
computation. The mobile users' energy minimization is formulated as a convex
problem, subject to the total computing latency constraint, the total energy
constraints for individual data downloading, and the computing frequency
constraints for local computing, for which classical Lagrangian duality can be
applied to find the optimal solution. Based upon the semi-closed form solution,
the shared data proves to be transmitted by only one of the mobile users
instead of multiple ones. Besides, compared to those baseline algorithms
without considering the shared data property or the mobile users' local
computing capabilities, the proposed joint computation offloading and

by at least 2 gaps. We observed the HD100546 environment with high contrast
imaging exploiting several different observing modes of SPHERE, including
datasets with/without coronagraphs, dual band imaging, integral field
spectroscopy and polarimetry. The picture emerging from these different data
sets is complex. Flux-conservative algorithms images clearly show the disk up
to 200au. More aggressive algorithms reveal several rings and warped arms
overlapping the main disk. The bright parts of this ring lie at considerable
height over the disk mid-plane at about 30au. Our images demonstrate that the
brightest wings close to the star in the near side of the disk are a unique
structure, corresponding to the outer edge of the intermediate disk at ~40au.
Modeling of the scattered light from the disk with a geometrical algorithm
reveals that a moderately thin structure can well reproduce the light
distribution in the flux-conservative images. We suggest that the gap between
44 and 113 au span between the 1:2 and 3:2 resonance orbits of a massive body
located at ~70au that might coincide with the candidate planet HD100546b
detected with previous thermal IR observations. In this picture, the two wings
can be the near side of a ring formed by disk material brought out of the disk
at the 1:2 resonance with the same massive object. While we find no clear
evidence confirming detection of the planet candidate HD100546c in our data, we
find a diffuse emission close to the expected position of HD100546b. This
source can be described as an extremely reddened substellar object surrounded
by a dust cloud or its circumplanetary disk. Its astrometry is broadly
consistent with a circular orbital motion on the disk plane.

feed forward network is trained by backpropagation algorithm to output the

assisting in a modified log-likelihood ratio (LLR) improvement. To reduce the
complexity, this feed-forward network simplifies the input layer with a single

inter-carrier interference between multiple subcarriers. On the basis of the

been developed in recent years. Actuating helical magnetic materials with a
homogeneous rotating magnetic field is one of the most widespread techniques
for propulsion at the microscale, partly because the actuation strategy
revolves around a simple linear relationship between the actuating field
frequency and the propeller velocity. However, the full control of the
swimmers' motion has remained a challenge. Increasing the controllability of
micropropellers is crucial to achieve complex actuation schemes that in turn
are directly relevant for numerous applications. The simplicity of the linear
relationship though limits the possibilities and flexibilities of swarm
control. Using a pool of randomly-shaped magnetic microswimmers, we show that
the complexity of shape can advantageously be translated into enhanced control.
In particular, directional reversal of sorted micropropellers is controlled by
the frequency of the actuating field. This directionality change is linked to
the balance between magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. We further show an
example how this behavior can experimentally lead to simple and effective
sorting of individual swimmers from a group. The ability of these propellers to
reverse swimming direction solely by frequency increases the control
possibilities and is an example for propeller designs, where the complexity
needed for many applications is embedded directly in the propeller geometry

angles of exoplanetary systems is through a spectroscopic transit observation
known as the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. So far mostly single RM
observations have been used to estimate the spin-orbit angle, and thus there
have been no studies regarding the variation of estimated spin-orbit angle from
transit to transit. Stellar activity can alter the shape of photometric transit
light curves and in a similar way they can deform the RM signal. In this paper
we discuss several RM observations, obtained using the HARPS spectrograph, of
known transiting planets that all transit extremely active stars, and by
analyzing them individually we assess the variation in the estimated spin-orbit
angle. Our results reveal that the estimated spin-orbit angle can vary
significantly (up to 42 degrees) from transit to transit, due to variation in
the configuration of stellar active regions over different nights. This finding
is almost two times larger than the expected variation predicted from
simulations. We could not identify any meaningful correlation between the
variation of estimated spin-orbit angles and the stellar magnetic activity
indicators. We also investigated two possible approaches to mitigate the
stellar activity influence on RM observations. The first strategy was based on
obtaining several RM observations and folding them to reduce the stellar
activity noise. Our results demonstrated that this is a feasible and robust way
to overcome this issue. The second approach is based on acquiring simultaneous
high-precision short-cadence photometric transit light curves using
TRAPPIST/SPECULOOS telescopes, which provide more information about the stellar
active region's properties and allow a better RM modeling.

value of the velocity gradient induced by the shear and the initial value of
the galactic magnetic field. Finally the different star formation rates and the
properties of the structures associated with this set of simulations are
computed. We first confirm that the feedback has a strong limiting effect on
star formation. The galactic shear has also a great influence: the higher the
shear, the lower the SFR. Taking the value of the velocity gradient in the
solar neighbourhood, the SFR is too high compared to the observed Kennicutt
law, by a factor approximately three to six. This discrepancy can be solved by
arguing that the relevant value of the shear is not the one in the solar
neighbourhood, and that in reality the star formation efficiency within
clusters is not 100%. Taking into account the fact that star-forming clouds
generally lie in spiral arms where the shear can be substantially higher (as
probed by galaxy-scale simulations), the SFR is now close to the observed one.
Different numerical recipes have been tested for the sink particles, giving a
numerical incertitude of a factor of about two on the SFR. Finally we have also
estimated the velocity dispersions in our dense clouds and found that they lie
below the observed Larson law by a factor of about two. Conclusions. In our
simulations, magnetic field, shear, HII regions, and supernovae all contribute
significantly to reduce the SFR. In this numerical setup with feedback from
supernovae and HII regions and a relevant value of galactic shear, the SFRs are
compatible with those observed, with a numerical incertitude factor of about
two.

representing more than 20 different medical conditions of the ocular region
(including cataract, glaucoma, rubeosis iridis, synechiae, iris defects,
corneal pathologies and other) and containing almost 3000 samples collected
from 230 distinct irises. Then, with the use of four different iris recognition
methods, a series of experiments has been conducted, concluding in several
important observations.
  One of the most popular ocular disorders worldwide - the cataract - is shown
to worsen genuine comparison scores when results obtained from
cataract-affected eyes are compared to those coming from healthy irises. An
analysis devoted to different types of impact on eye structures caused by
diseases is also carried out with significant results. The enrollment process
is highly sensitive to those eye conditions that make the iris obstructed or
introduce geometrical distortions. Disorders affecting iris geometry, or
producing obstructions are exceptionally capable of degrading the genuine
comparison scores, so that the performance of the entire biometric system can
be influenced. Experiments also reveal that imperfect execution of the image
segmentation stage is the most prominent contributor to recognition errors.

make use of a model of the defect density to separate the contribution of
two-magnon scattering to the damping from the isotropic contribution
originating in the spin pumping effect, the viscous Gilbert damping and the
magnetic proximity effect. The separation of the two-magnon contribution, which
depends strongly on the defect density, allows for the measurement of a value
of the effective spin mixing conductance which is closer to the value
exclusively due to spin pumping. The influence of the defect density for
bilayers systems due to the different capping layers and to the unavoidable
spread in defect density from sample to sample is thus removed. This shows the
potential of studying spin pumping phenomena in fully ordered systems in which
this separation is possible, contrary to polycrystalline or amorphous metallic

originally formulated in terms of variances, they have later been successfully
expressed with entropies following the advent of Shannon information theory.
Here, we review recent results on entropic uncertainty relations involving
continuous variables, such as position $x$ and momentum $p$. This includes the
generalization to arbitrary (not necessarily canonically-conjugate) variables
as well as entropic uncertainty relations that take $x$-$p$ correlations into
account and admit all Gaussian pure states as minimum uncertainty states. We
emphasize that these continuous-variable uncertainty relations can be
conveniently reformulated in terms of entropy power, a central quantity in the
information-theoretic description of random signals, which makes a bridge with
variance-based uncertainty relations. In this review, we take the quantum
optics viewpoint and consider uncertainties on the amplitude and phase
quadratures of the electromagnetic field, which are isomorphic to $x$ and $p$,
but the formalism applies to all such variables (and linear combinations
thereof) regardless of their physical meaning. Then, in the second part of this
paper, we move on to new results and introduce a tighter entropic uncertainty
relation for two arbitrary vectors of intercommuting continuous variables that
take correlations into account. It is proven conditionally on reasonable
assumptions. Finally, we present some conjectures for new entropic uncertainty
relations involving more than two continuous variables.

separation of the two lines of sight at the absorber redshift is $d_{\rm

carbon and H$_2$ along both lines of sight indicating that cold gas is present
on scales larger than $d_{\rm abs}$. We measure column densities of HI to be
$\log N(\rm H\,\i) = 20.27\pm0.02$ and $20.34\pm0.05$ and of H$_2$ to be $\log
N(\rm H_2) = 19.7\pm0.1$ and $19.9\pm0.2$. The metallicity inferred from
sulphur is consistent with Solar metallicity for both sightlines: $[{\rm

of low rotational levels of H$_2$, we constrain the temperature of the cold gas
phase to be $T=109\pm20$ and $T=89\pm25$ K for the two lines of sight. From the
relative excitation of fine-structure levels of CI, we constrain the hydrogen
volumetric densities in the range of $40-110$ cm$^{-3}$. Based on the ratio of
observed column density and volumetric density, we infer the average individual
`cloud' size along the line of sight to be $l\approx0.1$ pc. Using the
transverse line-of-sight separation of 0.7 kpc together with the individual
cloud size, we are able to put an upper limit to the volume filling factor of
cold gas of $f_{\rm vol} < 0.2$ %. Nonetheless, the projected covering fraction
of cold gas must be large (close to unity) over scales of a few kpc in order to
explain the presence of cold gas in both lines of sight. Compared to the
typical extent of DLAs (~10-30 kpc), this is consistent with the relative
incidence rate of CI absorbers and DLAs.

core with Held-Suarez physics, is used to accurately compute how eddy momentum
and heat fluxes change in response to the zonal wind and temperature anomalies
of the annular mode at the low-frequency limit. Using these results and knowing
the parameterizations of surface friction and thermal radiation in Held-Suarez
physics, the contribution of each physical process (meridional and vertical
eddy fluxes, surface friction, thermal radiation, and meridional advection) to
the annular mode dynamics is quantified. Examining the quasi-geostrophic
potential vorticity balance, it is shown that the eddy feedback is positive and
increases the persistence of the annular mode by a factor of more than two.
Furthermore, how eddy fluxes change in response to only the barotropic
component of the annular mode, i.e., vertically averaged zonal wind (and no
temperature) anomaly, is also calculated similarly. The response of eddy fluxes
to the barotropic-only component of the annular mode is found to be drastically
different from the response to the full (barotropic+baroclinic) annular mode
anomaly. In the former, the barotropic governor effect significantly suppresses
the eddy generation leading to a negative eddy feedback that decreases the
persistence of the annular mode by nearly a factor of three. These results
suggest that the baroclinic component of the annular mode anomaly, i.e., the
increased low-level baroclinicity, is essential for the persistence of the
annular mode, consistent with the baroclinic mechanism but not the barotropic
mechanism proposed in the previous studies.

helium-rich stars in N-body simulations of multiple population globular
clusters to investigate how the enriched helium stars impact the dynamics of
globular clusters. We show that a globular cluster with a helium-rich
concentrated population will be slightly smaller than a globular cluster with a
normal-helium second generation, with the largest difference seen in the
extended normal-helium population. This effect is shown both for a cluster in
isolation and one in a realistic Milky Way tidal field. We show that this
effect is a result of mass segregation, and the earlier loss of more massive
stars in a helium-rich concentrated population due to their decreased main
sequence lifetime. The two populations will therefore become dynamically mixed
at a slightly earlier time than if they have the same helium abundance.
Furthermore, we find that it is possible for the helium-enriched population to
become more extended than the normal-helium population if it forms with a low
initial concentration or the cluster is able to evolve for a large number of
relaxation times. We conclude that the dynamical effects of helium on stellar
masses are modest, and that the initial concentration of the two populations
and the strength of the Milky Way tidal field are more important in determining
the relative radial distributions of multiple populations.

great interest for optoelectronic and sensor applications. However, these two
properties are typically described by an inverse correlation with high
refractive index appearing in small gap materials and vice-versa. Here, we
conduct a first-principles high-throughput study on more than 4000
semiconductors (with a special focus on oxides). Our data confirm the general
inverse trend between refractive index and band gap but interesting outliers
are also identified. The data are then analyzed through a simple model
involving two main descriptors: the average optical gap and the effective
frequency. The former can be determined directly from the electronic structure
of the compounds, but the latter cannot. This calls for further analysis in
order to obtain a predictive model. Nonetheless, it turns out that the negative
effect of a large band gap on the refractive index can counterbalanced in two
ways: (i) by limiting the difference between the direct band gap and the
average optical gap which can be realized by a narrow distribution in energy of
the optical transitions and (ii) by increasing the effective frequency which
can be achieved through either a high number of transitions from the top of the
valence band to the bottom of the conduction or a high average probability for
these transitions.
  Focusing on oxides, we use our data to investigate how the chemistry
influences this inverse relationship and rationalize why certain classes of
materials would perform better. Our findings can be used to search for new
compounds in many optical applications both in the linear and non-linear regime
(waveguides, optical modulators, laser, frequency converter, etc.).

system in a situation that emulates a realistic, typical application. We
trained classification algorithms on a crowd-sourced collection of bird audio
recording data and restricted our training methods to be completely free of
manual intervention. The approach is hence directly applicable to the analysis
of multiple species collections, with labelling provided by crowd-sourced
collection. We evaluated the performance of the bird sound recognition system
on a realistic number of candidate classes, corresponding to real conditions.
We investigated the use of two canonical classification methods, chosen due to
their widespread use and ease of interpretation, namely a k Nearest Neighbour
(kNN) classifier with histogram-based features and a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) with time-summarisation features. We further investigated the use of a
certainty measure, derived from the output probabilities of the classifiers, to
enhance the interpretability and reliability of the class decisions. Our
results demonstrate that both identification methods achieved similar
performance, but we argue that the use of the kNN classifier offers somewhat
more flexibility. Furthermore, we show that employing an outcome certainty
measure provides a valuable and consistent indicator of the reliability of
classification results. Our use of generic training data and our investigation
of probabilistic classification methodologies that can flexibly address the
variable number of candidate species/classes that are expected to be
encountered in the field, directly contribute to the development of a practical
bird sound identification system with potentially global application. Further,
we show that certainty measures associated with identification outcomes can
significantly contribute to the practical usability of the overall system.

description has not yet been confirmed. We generalize the theory to a dynamic
treatment; that is, continuous change of the NS structure (rearrangement of the
stellar density distribution with the total baryon number fixed) as the
decrease of temperature during the thermal evolution, is taken into account. It
is found that the practical thermal energy used for the cooling is slightly
lower than that is estimated in static situation, and hence the cooling of NSs
is accelerated correspondingly but the effect is rather weak. Therefore, the
static treatment is a good approximation in the calculations of NS cooling.

to replace the standard convolution for embedded platforms. That significantly
reduces operations and parameters with only limited loss in accuracy. This
highly structured model is very suitable for Field-Programmable Gate Array

separable convolution optimized CNN accelerator is proposed. The accelerator
can be fit into an FPGA of different sizes, provided the balancing between

shown promise in achieving this goal. However, key factors such as imperfect
maternal transmission, loss of Wolbachia infection, reduced reproductive
capacity and shortened life-span affect the dynamics of Wolbachia in different

the likelihood of replacement of the Wolbachia-uninfected (WU) population is

discriminate the two stages, the spinnodal decompostion (SD) and domain growth
(DG), are compared and further investigated. The characteristic domain size and
morphological function present two geometric criteria. Both of them can only
provide rough estimations for the crossover from SD to DG. The reason for
domain size is that the crossover in this description covers a process, instead
of a specific time. The reason for the morphological function is that the
result may rely on chosen threshold value. However, both the non-equilibrium
strength and the entropy production rate are physical criteria and are more
convenient to provide critical times. In fact, not only the non-equilibrium
strength defined in the moment space opened by all the independent components
of the used non-equilibrium quantities but also those defined in its subspaces
can be used as criteria. Each of those criteria characterizes the phase
separation process from its own perspective. Consequently, the obtained
critical times may show slight differences. It should be pointed out that these
slight differences are not contradictive, but consistent with each other and
complementary in describing the complex phenomena.

holes (BHs) cannot source massless scalar fields. Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
(EMd) theory is an exception: through couplings both to electromagnetism and
(non-minimally) to gravity, a massless scalar field can be generated by an
electrically charged BH. In this work, we analytically model the dynamics of
binaries comprised of such scalar-charged (""hairy"") BHs. While BHs are not
expected to have substantial electric charge within the Standard Model of
particle physics, nearly-extremally charged BHs could occur in models of
minicharged dark matter and dark photons. We begin by studying the test-body
limit for a binary BH in EMd theory, and we argue that only very compact
binaries of nearly-extremally charged BHs can manifest non-perturbative
phenomena similar to those found in certain scalar-tensor theories. Then, we
use the post-Newtonian approximation to study the dynamics of binary BHs with
arbitrary mass ratios. We derive the equations governing the conservative and
dissipative sectors of the dynamics at next-to-leading order, use our results
to compute the Fourier-domain gravitational waveform in the stationary-phase
approximation, and compute the number of useful cycles measurable by the
Advanced LIGO detector. Finally, we construct two effective-one-body (EOB)
Hamiltonians for binary BHs in EMd theory: one that reproduces the exact
test-body limit and another whose construction more closely resembles similar
models in General Relativity, and thus could be more easily integrated into
existing EOB waveform models used in the data analysis of gravitational-wave
events by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations.

  Intensity Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the progress in automatic human behavior understanding, analysing the
perceived affect of multiple people has been recieved interest in affective
computing community. Unlike conventional facial expression analysis, this paper
primarily focuses on analysing the behaviour of multiple people in an image.
The proposed method is based on support vector regression with the combined
global alignment kernels (GAKs) to estimate the happiness intensity of a group
of people. We first exploit Riesz-based volume local binary pattern (RVLBP) and
deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based features for characterizing
facial images. Furthermore, we propose to use the GAK for RVLBP and deep CNN
features, respectively for explicitly measuring the similarity of two
group-level images. Specifically, we exploit the global weight sort scheme to
sort the face images from group-level image according to their spatial weights,
making an efficient data structure to GAK. Lastly, we propose Multiple kernel
learning based on three combination strategies for combining two respective
GAKs based on RVLBP and deep CNN features, such that enhancing the
discriminative ability of each GAK. Intensive experiments are performed on the
challenging group-level happiness intensity database, namely HAPPEI. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves promising
performance for group happiness intensity analysis, when compared with the
recent state-of-the-art methods.

model is trained with a joint loss on different granularity levels. We
demonstrate empirical results on the recent release of Something-Something

Network (CNN) in recent years. Most CNN applications on FPGA are
domain-specific, e.g., detecting objects from specific categories, in which
commonly-used CNN models pre-trained on general datasets may not be efficient
enough. This paper presents TuRF, an end-to-end CNN acceleration framework to
efficiently deploy domain-specific applications on FPGA by transfer learning
that adapts pre-trained models to specific domains, replacing standard
convolution layers with efficient convolution blocks, and applying layer fusion
to enhance hardware design performance. We evaluate TuRF by deploying a
pre-trained VGG-16 model for a domain-specific image recognition task onto a
Stratix V FPGA. Results show that designs generated by TuRF achieve better
performance than prior methods for the original VGG-16 and ResNet-50 models,
while for the optimised VGG-16 model TuRF designs are more accurate and easier
to process.

Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest neighbor interaction in one dimension
at half-filling. To obtain the ground state wave-function, we extend the
Baeriswyl variational wave function to account for alternating hopping
parameters. The ground state energies of the variational wave functions compare
well to exact diagonalization results. For the case of uniform hopping for all
bonds, where it is known that an ideal conductor to insulator transition takes
place at finite interaction, we also find a transition at an interaction
strength somewhat lower than the known value. The ideal conductor phase is a
Fermi sea. The phase diagram in the whole parameter range shows a resemblance
to the phase diagram of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. We also calculate the
gauge invariant cumulants corresponding to the polarization (Zak phase) and use
these to reconstruct the distribution of the polarization. We calculate the
reconstructed polarization distribution along a path in parameter space which
connects two points with opposite polarization in two ways. In one case we
cross the metallic phase line, in the other, we go through only insulating
states. In the former case, the average polarization changes discontinuously
after passing through the metallic phase line, while in the latter the
distribution ""walks across"" smoothly from one polarization to its opposite.
This state of affairs suggests that the correlation acts to break the chiral
symmetry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, in the same way as it happens when
a Rice-Mele onsite potential is turned on.
