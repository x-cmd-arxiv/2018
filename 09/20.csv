(HMPO) candidates by checking the association between the dense cores and the
IRAS sources, the detection of water maser, and the radio properties towards
the IRAS sources. We find that the HMPO sources are characterized by low FIR
luminosity to virial mass ratios since they are in very early evolutionary
stages when the massive protostars have not reached their full luminosities,
which are typical for zero-age main sequence stars. Large turbulent motion in
the HMPO sources may be largely due to the large kinetic energy ejected by the
central protostars formed in the dense clumps. However, alternative means or
undetected outflows may also be responsible for the turbulence in the clumps.

vibrational, electronic and optical properties of $\alpha$-PbO using first
principles calculations. Our theoretical calculations have shown that four
Raman active modes of $\alpha$-PbO tend to red-shift from bulk to monolayer due
to decreasing of force constants and increasing of bond lengths. It has been
shown that while bulk and multilayer $\alpha$-PbO have an indirect band gap,
monolayer form has a direct band gap value of 2.59 eV. Although lead atoms have
5d states, spin-orbit coupling does not significantly affect the band structure
of $\alpha$-PbO. The computed cleavage energy value (0.67 J/m$^2$) confirms
that monolayer PbO can be easily obtained from its bulk counterpart by
exfoliation methods. In addition to the band structure, we also calculated the
optical properties and absorbed photon flux $J_{abs}$ of $\alpha$-PbO
structures to investigate the possibility of solar absorption. Our calculations
reveal that while monolayer and bilayer PbO have relatively larger band gaps
and lower absorption coefficients, their $J_{abs}$ values are not ideal for
solar absorption devices. In contrast, the multilayer and bulk phases of the
$\alpha$-PbOs show good overlap with the solar spectrum and yield high
electrical current values. Our calculations have indicated that ultrathin films
of $\alpha$-PbO (such as 3nm thickness) could be excellent candidates for solar

supertranslation. This results in a diffeomorphic but physically distinct
geometry which differs from the original black hole by their charges at
infinity. Here we give the complementary description of this physical process
in the near-horizon region as seen by an observer hovering just outside the

*observable patch* of dS_4/Z_2 directly from the boundary 2-point function.

entire higher-spin multiplet, using a higher-spin-covariant language, which
provides a promising framework for the future inclusion of bulk interactions.
Aside from its importance for dS/CFT, our construction of a Hamiltonian
structure for a bulk causal region should be of interest within higher-spin
theory itself. The price we pay is a partial symmetry breaking, from the full
dS group (and its higher-spin extension) to the symmetry group of an observable
patch. While the boundary field theory plays a role in our arguments, the
results can be fully expressed within a boundary *particle mechanics*. Bulk
fields arise from this boundary mechanics via a version of second quantization.

than in conventional devices, to reduce size and cost. Theoretical and
computational study of trends in plasma behavior with increasing field strength
is critical to such proposed devices. This paper considers trends in Alfv\'en
eigenmode (AE) stability. Energetic particles, including alphas from D-T
fusion, can destabilize AEs, possibly causing loss of alpha heat and damage to
the device. AEs are sensitive to device magnetic field via the field dependence
of resonances, alpha particle beta, and alpha orbit width. We describe the
origin and effect of these dependences analytically and by using
recently-developed numerical techniques (Rodrigues et al. 2015 Nucl. Fusion 55
083003). The work suggests high-field machines where fusion-born alphas are
sub-Alfv\'enic or nearly sub-Alfv\'enic may partially cut off AE resonances,
reducing growth rates of AEs and the energy of alphas interacting with them.
High-field burning plasma regimes have non-negligible alpha particle beta and
AE drive, but faster slowing down time, provided by high electron density, and
higher field strength reduces this drive relative to low-field machines with
similar power densities. The toroidal mode number of the most unstable modes
will tend to be higher in high magnetic field devices. The work suggests that
high magnetic field devices have unique, and potentially advantageous, AE
instability properties at both low and high densities.

triboelectrification, has been recognized in volcanic plumes and sandstorms.
Yet, frictional charging almost certainly exists on other worlds, both in our
own Solar System (such as Mars, the Moon, and Venus) and exosolar planets.
Indeed, observations suggest that numerous planets in the galaxy are enshrouded
by optically-thick clouds or hazes. Triboelectric charging within these clouds
may contribute to global electric circuits of these worlds, providing
mechanisms to generate lightning, drive chemical processes in the atmospheres,
and, perhaps, influence habitability. In this work, we explore the frictional
electrification of potassium chloride and zinc sulfide, two substances proposed
to make up the clouds of giant exo-planets with >50x solar metallicities,
including the widely-studied super-Earth GJ 1214b, super-earth HD 97658b,
Neptune-sized GJ 436b, and hot- Jupiter WASP-31b. We find that both materials
become readily electrified when mobilized, attaining charge densities similar
to those found on volcanic ash particles. Thus, if these worlds do indeed host

electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), where rich maps are generated through

grain shape, crystallographic texture, and microstructure analysis this can be
inefficient. In this work, we present Rapid EBSD, a data fusion approach
combining forescatter electron (FSE) imaging with static sparse sampling of
EBSD patterns. We segment the FSE image into regions of similar colour (i.e.
phase and crystal orientation) and then collect representative EBSD data for
each segmented region. This enables microstructural assessment to be performed
at the spatial resolution of the (fast) FSE imaging whilst including
orientation and phase information from EBSD analysis of representative points.
We demonstrate the Rapid EBSD technique on samples of a cobalt based superalloy
and a strained dual phase titanium alloy, comparing the results with
conventional analysis. Rapid EBSD is advantageous for assessing grain size

criterion. Procedures that control the FDR, such as the well-known
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, assume that all p-values are available to be
tested at a single time point. However, this ignores the sequential nature of
many biomedical experiments, where a sequence of hypotheses is tested without

the first procedures that control the FDR in this online manner have been

that abstracts decision making away from individual devices and provides a
programmable network platform. However, implementing a centralized SDN
architecture within the constraints of a low-power wireless network faces
considerable challenges. Not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due
to unreliable links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN
can severely affect the performance of other traffic. This paper addresses the
challenge of bringing high-overhead SDN architecture to IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
We explore how traditional SDN needs to evolve in order to overcome the
constraints of low-power wireless networks, and discuss protocol and
architectural optimizations necessary to reduce SDN control overhead - the main
barrier to successful implementation. We argue that interoperability with the
existing protocol stack is necessary to provide a platform for controller
discovery and coexistence with legacy networks. We consequently introduce
{\mu}SDN, a lightweight SDN framework for Contiki, with both IPv6 and
underlying routing protocol interoperability, as well as optimizing a number of
elements within the SDN architecture to reduce control overhead to practical
levels. We evaluate {\mu}SDN in terms of latency, energy, and packet delivery.
Through this evaluation we show how the cost of SDN control overhead (both
bootstrapping and management) can be reduced to a point where comparable
performance and scalability is achieved against an IEEE 802.15.4-2012 RPL-based
network. Additionally, we demonstrate {\mu}SDN through simulation: providing a
use-case where the SDN configurability can be used to provide Quality of
Service (QoS) for critical network flows experiencing interference, and we
achieve considerable reductions in delay and jitter in comparison to a scenario
without SDN.

the low failures-CCM, which is more robust to high rate of resignations) that
adapts to changes in the quality of the reference set thanks to the translation

an objective function that is differentiable with respect to perturbations of

this function can be approached gradually when starting from a constant
exercise rate.

paramagnetic resonance measurements performed in the temperature range 300 K
till 80 K conform with the magnetization measurements as symmetric signals are
observed owing to the paramagnetic phase. Below 80 K, signals become
asymmetric. Electron paramagnetic resonance intensity peaks at ~ 110 K, the
decreasing intensity below this temperature confirming the presence of

constrained by material depleting mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds
due to the host star radiation or external radiation sources. Most previous
studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a
single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with
the photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external
radiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate
the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced
by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss
process can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including
its lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for
instance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar
disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our
model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary
case is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that
dispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk
temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also imply that dead zone
in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in
comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our
calculations are in agreement with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting
equal-mass binaries.

CPU-intensive reactive transport models (RTMs): Gaussian processes (GPs),
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and deep neural networks (DNNs). Besides
direct emulation of the simulated uranium concentration time series, replacing
the original RTM by its emulator is also investigated for global sensitivity
analysis (GSA), uncertainty propagation (UP) and probabilistic calibration
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The selected DNN is found to be
superior to both GPs and PCE in reproducing the input - output behavior of the
considered 8-dimensional and 13-dimensional CPU-intensive RTMs. Furthermore,
the two used PCE variants: standard PCE and sparse PCE (sPCE) appear to always
provide the least accuracy while not differing much in performance. As a
consequence of its better emulation capabilities, the used DNN outperforms the
two other methods for UP. In addition, DNNs and GPs offer equally good
approximations to the true first-order and total-order Sobol sensitivity
indices while PCE does somewhat less well. Most surprisingly, despite its
superior emulation skills the DNN approach leads to the worst solution of the
considered synthetic inverse problem which involves 1224 measurement data with
low noise. This apparently contradicting behavior is at least partially due to
the small but complicated deterministic noise that affects the DNN-based
predictions. Indeed, this complex error structure can drive the emulated
solutions far away from the true posterior distribution. Overall, our findings
indicate that when the available training set is relatively small (75 - to 500
input - output examples) and fixed beforehand, DNNs can well emulate RTMs but
are not suited to emulation-based inversion. In contrast, GPs perform fairly
well across all considered tasks: direct emulation, GSA, UP, and inversion.

public blockchain consensus protocols such as Bitcoins. Recent research efforts
in this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key
idea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which
then process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel
processing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees
significantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of
the system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of
the strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such
shard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for
designing appropriate incentives that will foster cooperation within committees
and prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by
analyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each
processor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in
the protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game
model of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing
approach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by
unilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social
dilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel
incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among
processors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating
processors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is
easier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing
mechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.

it to an authorized user over a packet-dropping channel, which is susceptible
to eavesdropping. Our goal is to design a coding scheme such that the
eavesdropper cannot infer the plant's current state, while the user
successfully decodes the sent messages. We employ a novel class of codes,
termed State-Secrecy Codes, which are fast and efficient for dynamical systems.
They apply linear time-varying transformations to the current and past states
received by the user. In this way, they force the eavesdropper's information
matrix to decrease with asymptotically the same rate as in the open-loop
prediction case, i.e. when the eavesdropper misses all messages. As a result,
the eavesdropper's minimum mean square error (mmse) for the unstable states
grows unbounded, while the respective error for the stable states converges to
the open-loop prediction one. These secrecy guarantees are achieved under
minimal conditions, which require that, at least once, the user receives the
corresponding packet while the eavesdropper fails to intercept it. Meanwhile,
the user's estimation performance remains optimal. The theoretical results are
illustrated in simulations.

vehicle instead of using multiple vehicles. This can reduce the number of
vehicles in the street, which consequently can reduce air pollution, traffic
congestion and transportation cost. However, a ride-sharing organization
requires passengers to report sensitive location information about their trips
to a trip organizing server (TOS) which creates a serious privacy issue. In
addition, existing ride-sharing schemes are non-flexible, i.e., they require a
driver and a rider to have exactly the same trip to share a ride. Moreover,
they are non-scalable, i.e., inefficient if applied to large geographic areas.
In this paper, we propose two efficient privacy-preserving ride-sharing
organization schemes for Non-transferable Ride-sharing Services (NRS) and
Transferable Ride-sharing Services (TRS). In the NRS scheme, a rider can share
a ride from its source to destination with only one driver whereas, in TRS
scheme, a rider can transfer between multiple drivers while en route until he
reaches his destination. In both schemes, the ride-sharing area is divided into
a number of small geographic areas, called cells, and each cell has a unique
identifier. Each driver/rider should encrypt his trip's data and send an
encrypted ride-sharing offer/request to the TOS. In NRS scheme, Bloom filters
are used to compactly represent the trip information before encryption. Then,
the TOS can measure the similarity between the encrypted trips data to organize
shared rides without revealing either the users' identities or the location
information. In TRS scheme, drivers report their encrypted routes, an then the
TOS builds an encrypted directed graph that is passed to a modified version of
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to search for an optimal path of rides that
can achieve a set of preferences defined by the riders.

the Welch bound is a lower bound on the root mean square cross correlation

reduced frame, composed of a random subset of Bernoulli selected vectors, is of
interest. The lower bound involves moment of the reduced frame, and it is tight
for ETFs and asymptotically coincides with the MANOVA moments. This result
offers a novel perspective on the superiority of ETFs over other frames.

construction of a periodic system whose corresponding stroboscopic map has an

solving an invariance equation. We show that the method to compute the PRC can

parameters used to describe the DNN grows at most polynomially in both the
reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $ \varepsilon > 0 $ and the

the climate of orbiting planets, making it important to characterize M dwarf
flares at the short wavelengths that drive atmospheric chemistry and escape. We
conducted a far-ultraviolet flare survey of 6 M dwarfs from the recent MUSCLES
(Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass
Exoplanetary Systems) observations, as well as 4 highly-active M dwarfs with
archival data. When comparing absolute flare energies, we found the
active-M-star flares to be about 10$\times$ more energetic than inactive-M-star
flares. However, when flare energies were normalized by the star's quiescent
flux, the active and inactive samples exhibited identical flare distributions,
with a power-law index of -$0.76^{+0.1}_{-0.09}$ (cumulative distribution). The
rate and distribution of flares are such that they could dominate the FUV
energy budget of M dwarfs, assuming the same distribution holds to flares as
energetic as those cataloged by Kepler and ground-based surveys. We used the
observed events to create an idealized model flare with realistic spectral and
temporal energy budgets to be used in photochemical simulations of exoplanet
atmospheres. Applied to our own simulation of direct photolysis by photons
alone (no particles), we find the most energetic observed flares have little
effect on an Earth-like atmosphere, photolyzing $\sim$0.01% of the total O$_3$
column. The observations were too limited temporally (73 h cumulative exposure)
to catch rare, highly energetic flares. Those that the power-law fit predicts
occur monthly would photolyze $\sim$1% of the O$_3$ column and those it
predicts occur yearly would photolyze the full O$_3$ column. Whether such
energetic flares occur at the rate predicted is an open question.

the radiation from the jet is enhanced by relativistic beaming, and there are
fundamental uncertainties concerning the matter content of the jet
(electron--proton or electron--positron plasma). However, in recent years,
there have been crucial advances mainly driven by the richness of data in the
$\gamma$-ray band. This is the band where blazars emit most of their
electromagnetic power. Furthermore, there are now large sample of $\gamma$-ray
loud blazars covered by optical spectroscopy. For the blazar sub-class of flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) these data provide measurements of the main
emission lines and of the underlying continuum. From these data, it is
relatively easy to infer the bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk. The
relativistic jet emission on one hand, and the disk luminosity on the other
hand, allows us to compare the jet power and the accretion luminosity. Although
the inferred jet power is subject to a few assumptions and is somewhat
model--dependent, it is possible to derive a lower limit to the jet power that
is assumption-free and model-independent. Since this lower limit is of the
order of the accretion luminosity, we infer that the true jet power is larger.

component in our understanding of the structure of dark matter halos. While
numerous models for this relation have been proposed, almost none of them
attempt to derive the evolution of the relation analytically. We build on
previous efforts to model the c-M relation as a function of physical parameters
such as the peak height, $\nu$, and the effective power spectrum slope, $n_{\rm
eff}$, which capture the dependence of $c$ on halo mass, redshift, and
cosmology. We present three major improvements over previous models. First, we
derive an analytical expression for the c-M relation that is valid under the
assumption of pseudo-evolution, i.e., assuming that the density profiles of
halos are static in physical coordinates while the definition of their boundary
evolves. We find that this ansatz is highly successful in describing the
evolution of the low-mass end of the c-M relation. Second, we employ a new
physical variable, the effective exponent of linear growth, $\alpha_{\rm eff}$,
to parameterize deviations from an Einstein-de Sitter expansion history. Third,
we combine an updated definition of $n_{\rm eff}$ with the additional
dependence on $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ and propose a phenomenological extension of
our analytical framework to include all halo masses. This semianalytical model
matches simulated concentrations in both scale-free models and LambdaCDM to 5%
accuracy with very few exceptions and differs significantly from all previously
proposed models. We present a publicly available code to compute the

into a pair of $W/Z$ bosons can appear in several extensions of the SM. The
focus of collider studies for such a scalar is often on its direct production,
where the scalar is typically only mildly boosted. The observed $W/Z$ are
therefore well-separated, allowing analyses for the scalar resonance in a
standard fashion as a low-mass diboson resonance. In this work we instead focus
on the scenario where the direct production of the scalar is suppressed, and it
is rather produced via the decay of a significantly heavier (a few TeV mass)
new particle, in conjunction with SM particles. Such a process results in the
scalar being highly boosted, rendering the $W/Z$'s from its decay merged. The
final state in such a decay is a ""fat"" jet, which can be either four-pronged
(for fully hadronic $W/Z$ decays), or may be like a $W/Z$ jet, but with leptons
buried inside (if one of the $W/Z$ decays leptonically). In addition, this fat
jet has a jet mass that can be quite different from that of the $W/Z$/Higgs/top

develop dedicated algorithms for tagging such multi-layered ""boosted dibosons""

leading model to explain the superorbital modulation. The High Mass X-ray
Binary SMC X-1 showed two excursions in superorbital period (from ~60d to ~45d)
during the 1996-2011 interval, suggesting that some characteristic of the
accretion disc is varying on a timescale of years. Because its behaviour as an
X-ray pulsar has also been intensively monitored, SMC X-1 offers the rare
chance to track changes in both the accretion disk and pulsar behaviours over
the same interval. We have used archival X-ray observations of SMC X-1 to
investigate whether the evolution of its superorbital variation and pulse
period are correlated. We use the 16-year dataset afforded by the RXTE~All-Sky
Monitor to trace the behaviour of the warped accretion disc in this system, and
use published pulse-period histories to trace the behaviour of the pulsar.
While we cannot claim a strong detection of correlation, the first superorbital
period excursion near MJD 50,800 does coincide with structure in SMC X-1's
pulse period history. Our preferred interpretation is that the superorbital
period excursion coincides with a change in the long-term spin-up rate of the
SMC X-1 pulsar. In this scenario, the pulsar and the accretion disc are both
responding to a change in the accretion flow, which the disc itself may
regulate.

Myr) is in tension with the binary break-up scenario proposed to explain their

O-type stars that lies at a farther distance from the SMBH. Here we investigate
a new formation scenario, assuming that both S-stars and the O-type stars were
born in the same disk around SgrA*. We simulate encounters between binaries of
the stellar disk and stellar black holes from a dark cusp around SgrA*. We find
that B-type binaries can be easily broken up by the encounters and their binary
components are kicked into highly eccentric orbits around the SMBH. In
contrast, O-type binaries are less frequently disrupted and their members
remain in low eccentricity orbits. This mechanism can reproduce 12 S-stars just
by assuming that the binaries initially lie within the stellar disk as observed
nowadays. To reproduce all the S-stars, the original disk must have been
extended down to 0.006 pc. However in this case many B- and O-type stars remain
in low eccentricity orbits below 0.03 pc, in contrast with the observations.
Therefore, some other mechanism is necessary to disrupt the disk below 0.03 pc.
This scenario can also explain the high eccentricity of the G-objects, if they

different inclination angles, signal-to-noise ratios, the presence of warps or

the lens lines of sight are consistent with the control sample. The local

survey strategies which increase cadence in these bands and minimize seasonal

Finally, although the DDFs will provide more densely sampled light curves, we
expect only ~50 SLSNe with recoverable parameters in each field in the

them with the currently known F/1O Cepheids and using the Gaia DR2 parallaxes

of -0.040$\pm$0.002 dex/kpc using a total least squares method. These results

will be a survey of bright, low redshift galaxies, which is planned to cover an
area of ~14,000 sq deg in 3 passes. Each pass will cover the survey area with
~2000 pointings, each of area ~8 sq deg. The BGS is currently proposed to
consist of a bright high priority sample to an r-band magnitude limit r ~ 19.5,
with a fainter low priority sample to r ~ 20. The geometry of the DESI fibre
positioners in the focal plane of the telescope affects the completeness of the
survey, and has a non-trivial impact on clustering measurements. Using a BGS
mock catalogue, we show that completeness due to fibre assignment primarily
depends on the surface density of galaxies. Completeness is high (>95%) in low
density regions, but very low (<10%) in the centre of massive clusters. We
apply the pair inverse probability (PIP) weighting correction to clustering
measurements from a BGS mock which has been through the fibre assignment
algorithm. This method is only unbiased if it is possible to observe every
galaxy pair. To facilitate this, we randomly promote a small fraction of the
fainter sample to be high priority, and dither the set of tile positions by a
small angle. We show that inverse pair weighting combined with angular
upweighting provides an unbiased correction to galaxy clustering measurements
for the complete 3 pass survey, and also after 1 pass, which is highly
incomplete.

high signal-to-noise ratio, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs)
has been widely used to build BCIs. However, currently developed algorithms do
not predict the modulation of SSVEP amplitude, which is known to change as a
function of stimulus luminance contrast. In this study, we aim to develop an
integrated approach to simultaneously estimate the frequency and
contrast-related amplitude modulations of the SSVEP signal. To achieve that, we
developed a behavioral task in which human participants focused on a visual
flicking target which the luminance contrast can change through time in several
ways. SSVEP signals from 16 subjects were then recorded from electrodes placed
at the central occipital site using a low-cost, consumer-grade EEG. Our results
demonstrate that the filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA)
performed well in SSVEP frequency recognition, while the support vector
regression (SVR) outperformed the other supervised machine learning algorithms
in predicting the contrast-dependent amplitude modulations of the SSVEPs. These
findings indicate the applicability and strong performance of our integrated
method at simultaneously predicting both frequency and amplitude of visually
evoked signals, and have proven to be useful for advancing SSVEP-based
applications.

industrially relevant applications that require a good understanding of
equilibrium phase diagrams, thermal and chemical transport, and microstructure
evolution. The goal of thermodynamic models is to capture data from both
experimental and computational studies and then make reliable predictions when
extrapolating to new regions of parameter space. These predictions will be
impacted by artifacts present in real data sets such as outliers, systematics
errors and unreliable or missing uncertainty bounds. Such issues increase the
probability of the thermodynamic model producing erroneous predictions. We
present a Bayesian framework for the selection, calibration and quantification
of uncertainty of thermodynamic property models. The modular framework
addresses numerous concerns regarding thermodynamic models including
thermodynamic consistency, robustness to outliers and systematic errors by the
use of hyperparameter weightings and robust Likelihood and Prior distribution
choices. Furthermore, the framework's inherent transparency (e.g. our choice of
probability functions and associated parameters) enables insights into the
complex process of thermodynamic assessment. We introduce these concepts
through examples where the true property model is known. In addition, we
demonstrate the utility of the framework through the creation of a property
model from a large set of experimental specific heat and enthalpy measurements

to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low

masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and
by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are
heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient
recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This
implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (<0.1-1 Myr)
and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or
that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from
the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in
even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are

stage is devoted to model reverberation. Both steps are taken by minimizing a
cost function in which the aim is put either in constructing a dictionary or a
good representation by changing the divergence involved. In addition, an

Nash equilibria under such settings, we introduce a so called augmented game
mapping and provide conditions under which this mapping is strongly monotone.
We consider a distributed gradient play algorithm for determining a Nash

step to minimize her own cost function while sharing and retrieving information
locally among her neighbors in the network. Using the reformulation of the Nash
equilibrium problem based on the strong monotone augmented game mapping, we
prove the convergence of this algorithm to a Nash equilibrium with a geometric

optimal solutions of the same minimization problem. The proposed cost function
is defined by two design parameters that not only establish a desired trade-off

applications that require online adaptation of the suppression function
according to variations of the acoustic scenario. Simulation examples indicate
that the derived conformable suppression mask has approximately the same

below the onset of wave generation. In that regime, the liquid surface is
populated by small disorganised deformations elongated in the streamwise
direction. Formally identified recently by Paquier et al. (2015), the
deformations that occur below the wave onset were named wrinkles. We provide
here a theoretical framework for this wrinkle regime, using the viscous
response of a free surface liquid submitted to arbitrary normal and tangential
interfacial stresses at its upper boundary. We relate the spatio-temporal
spectrum of the surface deformations to that of the applied interfacial
pressure and shear stress fluctuations. For that, we evaluate the
spatio-temporal statistics of the turbulent forcing using Direct Numerical
Simulation of a turbulent air channel flow, assuming no coupling between the
air and the liquid flows. Combining theory and numerical simulation, we thus
obtain synthetic wrinkles that reproduce previous experimental investigations.
We show that the wrinkles are a multi-scale superposition of random wakes
generated by the turbulent fluctuations. They result mainly from the nearly
isotropic pressure fluctuations generated in the boundary layer, rather than
from the elongated shear stress fluctuations. The wrinkle regime described in
this paper naturally arises as the viscous-saturated asymptotic of the inviscid
growth theory of Phillips (1957). Experiments indicate that the onset of
exponential wave growth depends on the liquid viscosity. Our theory suggests
that the empirical criterion for the onset is satisfied when the wrinkle
amplitude reaches a given fraction of the viscous sublayer thickness. It
indicates that the turbulent fluctuations near the onset may play a role in the
triggering of exponential wave growth.

composition of one Boolean function and one vectorial function, for the purpose
of specifying new secondary constructions of bent/plateaued functions. This
representation gives a better understanding of the existing secondary
constructions and it also allows us to provide a general construction framework
of these objects. This framework essentially gives rise to an {\em infinite
number} of possibilities to specify such secondary construction methods (with
some induced sufficient conditions imposed on initial functions) and in
particular we solve several open problems in this context. We provide several
explicit methods for specifying new classes of bent/plateaued functions and
demonstrate through examples that the imposed initial conditions can be easily
satisfied. Our approach is especially efficient when defining new
bent/plateaued functions on larger variable spaces than initial functions. For
instance, it is shown that the indirect sum methods and Rothaus' construction
are just special cases of this general framework and some explicit extensions
of these methods are given. In particular, similarly to the basic indirect sum
method of Carlet, we show that it is possible to derive (many) secondary
constructions of bent functions without any additional condition on initial
functions apart from the requirement that these are bent functions. In another
direction, a few construction methods that generalize the secondary
constructions which do not extend the variable space of the employed initial
functions are also proposed.

concentrated shapes, recent computational work has shown that these features
naturally become much more elongated in the gas when simulations account for
the relatively long timescale over which planets accrete their mass. In this
work, we conduct two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations of vortices induced by
slowly-growing Jupiter-mass planets in discs with very low viscosity ($\alpha =
3 \times 10^{-5}$). We simulate the dust dynamics for four particle sizes
spanning 0.3 mm to 1 cm in order to produce synthetic ALMA images. In our
simulations, we find that an elongated vortex still traps dust, but not
directly at its center. With a flatter pressure bump and disruptions from the
planet's overlapping spiral density waves, the dust instead circulates around
the vortex. This motion (1) typically carries the peak off-center, (2) spreads
the dust out over a wider azimuthal extent $\geq 180^{\circ}$, (3) skews the
azimuthal profile towards the front of the vortex, and (4) can also create
double peaks in newly-formed vortices. In particular, we expect that the most
defining observational signature, a peak offset of more than $30^{\circ}$,
should be detectable $>30\%$ of the time in observations with a beam diameter
of at most the planet's separation from its star.

permutation $\sigma$ viewed as a sequence of integers, computing the weight of
$\sigma$ involves recursively counting descents of certain subpermutations of
$\sigma$. Using this weight function, one can define a $q$-analog $E_n(x,q)$ of
the Eulerian polynomials. We prove two main results regarding weights of
permutations and the polynomials $E_n(x,q)$. First, we show that the
coefficients of $E_n(x, q)$ stabilize as $n$ goes to infinity, which was
conjectured by Dugan, Glennon, Gunnells, and Steingr\'imsson (Journal of
Combinatorial Theory, Series A 164:24-49, 2019), and enables the definition of
the formal power series $W_d(t)$, which has interesting combinatorial
properties. Second, we derive a recurrence relation for $E_n(x, q)$, similar to
the known recurrence for the classical Eulerian polynomials $A_n(x)$. Finally,
we give a recursive formula for the numbers of certain integer partitions and,
from this, conjecture a recursive formula for the stabilized coefficients

where the surfaces are nearly isometric. However, it is much more challenging
to compute correspondence between surfaces which are intrinsically less
similar. In this paper, we propose a variational model to align the
Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigensytems of two non-isometric genus zero shapes via
conformal deformations. This method enables us compute to geometric meaningful
point-to-point maps between non-isometric shapes. Our model is based on a novel
basis pursuit scheme whereby we simultaneously compute a conformal deformation
of a 'target shape' and its deformed LB eigensytem. We solve the model using an
proximal alternating minimization algorithm hybridized with the augmented
Lagrangian method which produces accurate correspondences given only a few
landmark points. We also propose a reinitialization scheme to overcome some of
the difficulties caused by the non-convexity of the variational problem.
Intensive numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed method to handle non-isometric surfaces with large deformation
with respect to both noise on the underlying manifolds and errors within the
given landmarks.

cameras; each has a field-of-view of 24x24 degrees. During the first two years
of the primary mission, one of these cameras, Camera #1, is going to observe
fields centered at an ecliptic latitude of 18 degrees. While the ecliptic plane
itself is not covered during the primary mission, the characteristic scale
height of the main asteroid belt and Kuiper belt implies that a significant
amount of small solar system bodies will cross the field-of-view of this
camera. Based on the comparison of the expected amount of information of TESS
and Kepler/K2, we can compute the cumulative etendues of the two optical
setups. This comparison results in roughly comparable optical etendues, however
the net etendue is significantly larger in the case of TESS since all of the
imaging data provided by the 30-minute cadence frames are downlinked rather
than the pre-selected stamps of Kepler/K2. In addition, many principles of the
data acquisition and optical setup are clearly different, including the level
of confusing background sources, full-frame integration and cadence, the
field-of-view centroid with respect to the apparent position of the Sun, as
well as the differences in the duration of the campaigns. As one would expect,
TESS will yield time-series photometry and hence rotational properties for only

the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third is
due to limited knowledge of external branching fractions.

the two rigid parts of a scissor pivot against each other to perform the
cutting function. Such articulations are often similar across objects within
the same functional category. In this paper, we explore how the observation of
different articulation states provides evidence for part structure and motion
of 3D objects. Our method takes as input a pair of unsegmented shapes
representing two different articulation states of two functionally related
objects, and induces their common parts along with their underlying rigid
motion. This is a challenging setting, as we assume no prior shape structure,
no prior shape category information, no consistent shape orientation, the
articulation states may belong to objects of different geometry, plus we allow
inputs to be noisy and partial scans, or point clouds lifted from RGB images.
Our method learns a neural network architecture with three modules that
respectively propose correspondences, estimate 3D deformation flows, and
perform segmentation. To achieve optimal performance, our architecture
alternates between correspondence, deformation flow, and segmentation
prediction iteratively in an ICP-like fashion. Our results demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the task of
discovering articulated parts of objects. In addition, our part induction is
object-class agnostic and successfully generalizes to new and unseen objects.

under a sharp null hypothesis that can recover all missing potential outcomes.
However, it is often sought after to test a weak null hypothesis that the

hypothesis, we must address two issues. First, we need to impute the missing
potential outcomes although the weak null hypothesis cannot determine all of
them. Second, we need to choose a proper test statistic. For a general weak
null hypothesis, we propose an approach to imputing missing potential outcomes
under a compatible sharp null hypothesis. Building on this imputation scheme,
we advocate a studentized statistic. The resulting FRT has multiple desirable
features. First, it is model-free. Second, it is finite-sample exact under the
sharp null hypothesis that we use to impute the potential outcomes. Third, it
conservatively controls large-sample type I errors under the weak null
hypothesis of interest. Therefore, our FRT is agnostic to the treatment effect
heterogeneity. We establish a unified theory for general factorial experiments.
We also extend it to stratified and clustered experiments.

unloading from an initial load. Based on a fiber bundle model of time dependent
fracture, we show that depending on the unloading rate the system has two
phases: for rapid unloading the system suffers only partial failure and it has
an infinite lifetime, while at slow unloading macroscopic failure occurs in a
finite time. The transition between the two phases proved to be analogous to
continuous phase transitions. Computer simulations revealed that during
unloading the fracture proceeds in bursts of local breakings triggered by
slowly accumulating damage. In both phases the time evolution starts with a
relaxation of the bursting activity characterized by a universal power law
decay of the burst rate. In the phase of finite lifetime the initial slowdown
is followed by an acceleration towards macroscopic failure where the increasing
rate of bursts obeys the (inverse) Omori law of earthquakes. We pointed out a
strong correlation between the time where the event rate reaches a minimum
value and of the lifetime of the system which allows for forecasting of the
imminent catastrophic failure.

open world, their accountability becomes a high priority problem.
Accountability requires deep understanding of system behavior and its failures.
Current evaluation methods such as single-score error metrics and confusion
matrices provide aggregate views of system performance that hide important
shortcomings. Understanding details about failures is important for identifying
pathways for refinement, communicating the reliability of systems in different
settings, and for specifying appropriate human oversight and engagement.
Characterization of failures and shortcomings is particularly complex for
systems composed of multiple machine learned components. For such systems,
existing evaluation methods have limited expressiveness in describing and
explaining the relationship among input content, the internal states of system
components, and final output quality. We present Pandora, a set of hybrid
human-machine methods and tools for describing and explaining system failures.
Pandora leverages both human and system-generated observations to summarize
conditions of system malfunction with respect to the input content and system
architecture. We share results of a case study with a machine learning pipeline

sequential patterns play an important role where more recent items in a

Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model (\emph{Caser}) as a

patterns as local features of the image using convolutional filters. This
approach provides a unified and flexible network structure for capturing both
general preferences and sequential patterns. The experiments on public datasets
demonstrated that Caser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation methods on a variety of common evaluation metrics.

ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model

orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We
address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public

avoided, we develop methods to minimize the error, and implement error analysis
tools. We demonstrate the feasibility of using CRN++ on a suite of well-known

extended to support new commands or chemical reaction implementations, and thus

potential challenges to LCDM have been identified when confronting the expected

Solving these problems requires that most dwarf galaxies inhabit halos of
similar mass, and that there is a relatively sharp minimum halo mass threshold
to form luminous galaxies. These predictions are eminently falsifiable. In
particular, LCDM predicts a large number of `dark' low-mass halos, some of
which should have retained enough primordial gas to be detectable in deep 21 cm

In 2001, Eskin and Okounkov proved that generating functions for the number of

quasimodular forms for $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}).$ In 2006, they generalized this
theorem to the enumeration of branched covers of the quotient of an elliptic
curve by $\pm 1$, proving quasi-modularity for $\Gamma_1(2)$. In 2017, the

\zeta_N\rangle$ for $N=3, 4, 6$, proving quasimodularity for $\Gamma_1(N)$.
  In these works, both Eskin-Okounkov and the author had to assume that there
was at least one orbifold point of order $N$ over which there was no
ramification. Here we remove that assumption, with the caveat that the
generating functions are only quasimodular for $\Gamma(N)$. We deduce the
following corollary: Let $h_6(\vec{\kappa},q)$ be the generating function whose
$q^n$ coefficient is the number of surface triangulations with $2n$ triangles,
such that the set of non-zero curvatures is $\kappa_i$. Here the curvature of a

$\Gamma_1(6)$ with weight bounded in terms of $\vec{\kappa}$. This statement in
turn implies that the Masur-Veech volume of any stratum of sextic differentials

thoracic diseases, playing an important role in the healthcare workflow.
However, reading the chest X-ray images and giving an accurate diagnosis remain
challenging tasks for expert radiologists. With the success of deep learning in
computer vision, a growing number of deep neural network architectures were
applied to chest X-ray image classification. However, most of the previous deep
neural network classifiers were based on deterministic architectures which are
usually very noise-sensitive and are likely to aggravate the overfitting issue.
In this paper, to make a deep architecture more robust to noise and to reduce
overfitting, we propose using deep generative classifiers to automatically
diagnose thorax diseases from the chest X-ray images. Unlike the traditional
deterministic classifier, a deep generative classifier has a distribution
middle layer in the deep neural network. A sampling layer then draws a random
sample from the distribution layer and input it to the following layer for
classification. The classifier is generative because the class label is
generated from samples of a related distribution. Through training the model
with a certain amount of randomness, the deep generative classifiers are
expected to be robust to noise and can reduce overfitting and then achieve good
performances. We implemented our deep generative classifiers based on a number
of well-known deterministic neural network architectures, and tested our models
on the chest X-ray14 dataset. The results demonstrated the superiority of deep
generative classifiers compared with the corresponding deep deterministic
classifiers.

increases from the overdoped Fermi-liquid regime to the optimally doped strange

temporal evolution of the nanostructure, three experimental regimes are
identified: (1) concomitant precipitate nucleation and growth (t less than 0.25
h); (2) concurrent coagulation and coalescence (t 0.25 to 16 h); and (3)
quasi-stationary coarsening of gamma prime(L12)- precipitates (t 16 to 1024 h).
The temporal dependencies of the mean precipitate radius and precipitate number
density, Nv(t), are determined experimentally, 0.344 (0.012) and -0.95(0.02),
respectively, following the predictions of quasi-stationary coarsening models.
In this alloy aged at 978 K, Al partitions strongly to the gamma

partition to the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix with values of 0.61(0.01) and 0.90(0.01),

exponents of the Al, Mo, and Ni supersaturations in both the
gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix and gamma prime(L12)-precipitates are in reasonable
agreement with a multi-component coarsening model's prediction of -0.33.

demonstrate that coagulation and coalescence are consequences of the overlap of
the diffusion fields surrounding the gamma prime(L12)-precipitates. Both 3-D

decrease with increasing values. And the interfacial compositional width at

of the transient show a slow decay over five months, in agreement with previous
optically discovered TDEs. It also has a comparable black-body peak luminosity
of $L_{\rm{peak}} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{44}$ erg/s. The inferred temperature
from the optical and UV data shows a value of (3$-$5) $\times 10^4$ K. The
transient is not detected in X-rays up to $L_X < 3 \times 10^{42}$erg/s within
the first five months after discovery. The optical spectra exhibit two distinct
broad emission lines in the He II region, and at later times also H$\alpha$
emission. Additionally, emission from [N III] and [O III] is detected, likely
produced by the Bowen fluorescence effect. UV spectra reveal broad emission and
absorption lines associated with high-ionization states of N V, C IV, Si IV,
and possibly P V. These features, analogous to those of broad absorption line
quasars (BAL QSOs), require an absorber with column densities $N_{\rm{H}} >
10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. This optically thick gas would also explain the
non-detection in soft X-rays. The profile of the absorption lines with the
highest column density material at the largest velocity is opposite that of BAL
QSOs. We suggest that radiation pressure generated by the TDE flare at early
times could have provided the initial acceleration mechanism for this gas.
Spectral UV line monitoring of future TDEs could test this proposal.

Evolutionary label distribution learning adaptively learns and constantly
refines the age label distributions without making strong assumptions on the
distribution patterns. To further utilize the ordered and continuous

seen great progress. However, the accuracy, latency, and computational cost of
such methods remain insufficient. The majority of the previous methods have
formulated the separation problem through the time-frequency representation of
the mixed signal, which has several drawbacks, including the decoupling of the
phase and magnitude of the signal, the suboptimality of time-frequency
representation for speech separation, and the long latency in calculating the
spectrograms. To address these shortcomings, we propose a fully-convolutional
time-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet), a deep learning framework
for end-to-end time-domain speech separation. Conv-TasNet uses a linear encoder
to generate a representation of the speech waveform optimized for separating
individual speakers. Speaker separation is achieved by applying a set of
weighting functions (masks) to the encoder output. The modified encoder
representations are then inverted back to the waveforms using a linear decoder.
The masks are found using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) consisting of
stacked 1-D dilated convolutional blocks, which allows the network to model the
long-term dependencies of the speech signal while maintaining a small model
size. The proposed Conv-TasNet system significantly outperforms previous
time-frequency masking methods in separating two- and three-speaker mixtures.
Additionally, Conv-TasNet surpasses several ideal time-frequency magnitude
masks in two-speaker speech separation as evaluated by both objective
distortion measures and subjective quality assessment by human listeners.
Finally, Conv-TasNet has a significantly smaller model size and a shorter
minimum latency, making it a suitable solution for both offline and real-time
speech separation applications.

flat bands, the surface order parameter and the surface impurity play essential
roles in determining the surface properties. In this work, we studied the
effect of the surface order parameter and the surface impurity on the surface
Majorana flat bands of half-Heusler superconductors based on the Luttinger

phase induced by the singlet-quintet pairing mixing, classify all the possible

irreducible representations of $C_{3v}$ point group, and demonstrate that any
energetically favorable order parameter needs to break time-reversal symmetry.

Majorana flat bands induced by different order parameters and non-magnetic or
magnetic impurities. We proposed that the splitting in the energy spectrum can
serve as the fingerprint of the pairing symmetry and mean-field order
parameters. Our theoretical prediction can be examined in the future scanning

of finding consistent correspondences between two feature sets. Feature
correspondence (matching) problem with one-to-one mapping constraint is usually
formulated as an Integral Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem with permutation
(or orthogonal) constraint. Since it is NP-hard, relaxation models are
required. One main challenge for optimizing IQP matching problem is how to
incorporate the discrete one-to-one mapping (permutation) constraint in its
quadratic objective optimization. In this paper, we present a new relaxation
model, called Sparse Constraint Preserving Matching (SPM), for IQP matching
problem. SPM is motivated by our observation that the discrete permutation
constraint can be well encoded via a sparse constraint. Comparing with
traditional relaxation models, SPM can incorporate the discrete one-to-one
mapping constraint straightly via a sparse constraint and thus provides a
tighter relaxation for original IQP matching problem. A simple yet effective
update algorithm has been derived to solve the proposed SPM model. Experimental
results on several feature matching tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and

However, most such machine learning algorithms are both computation-and-memory

computations on a single device of limited computation, memory, and energy
resources. Wireless distributed computing presents new opportunities by pooling
the computation and storage resources among devices. For low-latency
applications, the key bottleneck lies in the exchange of intermediate results
among mobile devices for data shuffling. To improve communication efficiency,
we propose a co-channel communication model and design transceivers by
exploiting the locally computed intermediate values as side information. A
low-rank optimization model is proposed to maximize the achieved
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) by establishing the interference alignment condition
for data shuffling. Unfortunately, existing approaches to approximate the rank
function fail to yield satisfactory performance due to the poor structure in

efficient DC algorithm to solve the presented low-rank optimization problem by
proposing a novel DC representation for the rank function. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed DC approach can significantly improve
the communication efficiency whereas the achievable DoF almost remains

xy,\, y \rightarrow zu,\,
  z \rightarrow zw,\, w \rightarrow xv,\,
  u \rightarrow xyz^{-1}v,\,
  v \rightarrow x^{-1}zwu$ over the variable set $V=\{x,y,z,w,u,v\}$. We use
this grammar to study joint distributions of several permutation statistics
related to descents, rises, peaks and valleys. By considering the pattern of an
exterior peak, we introduce the exterior peaks of pattern 132 and of pattern
231. Similarly, peaks can also be classified according to their patterns. Let
$D$ be the formal derivative operator with respect to the grammar $G$. By using
a grammatical labeling, we show that $D^n(z)$ is the generating function of the
number of permutations on $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with given numbers of exterior
peaks of pattern 132 and of pattern 231, and proper double descents. By solving
a cylinder differential equation, we obtain an explicit formula of the
generating function of $D^n(z)$, which can be viewed as a unification of the
results of Elizalde-Noy, Barry, Basset, Fu and Gessel. Specializations lead to
the joint distributions of certain consecutive patterns in permutations, as
studied by Elizalde-Noy and Kitaev. By a different labeling with respect to the
same grammar $G$, we derive the joint distribution of peaks of pattern 132 and
of pattern 231, double descents and double rises, with the generating function
also expressed by the parabolic cylinder functions. This formula serves as a
refinement of the work of Carlitz-Scoville. Furthermore, we obtain the joint
distribution of exterior peaks of pattern 132 and of pattern 231 over
alternating permutations.

appearance of the hole pockets in the folded Fermi surface, which impact on
transport properties consecutively at different locations in the momentum

makes such private relationships not visible to public users or even friends.
This leads to a new graph model called public-private networks, where each user
has her/his own perspective of the network including the private connections.
Recently, public-private network analysis has attracted significant research
interest in the literature. A great deal of important graph computing problems
(e.g., shortest paths, centrality, PageRank, and reachability tree) has been
studied. However, due to the limited data sources and privacy concerns,
proposed approaches are not tested on real-world datasets, but on synthetic
datasets by randomly selecting vertices as private ones. Therefore, real-world
datasets of public-private networks are essential and urgently needed for such
algorithms in the evaluation of efficiency and effectiveness.
  In this paper, we generate four public-private networks from real-world DBLP
records, called PPDBLP. We take published articles as public information and
regard ongoing collaborations as the hidden information, which is only known by
the authors. Our released datasets of PPDBLP offer the prospects for verifying
various kinds of efficient public-private analysis algorithms in a fair way. In
addition, motivated by widely existing attributed graphs, we propose an
advanced model of attributed public-private graphs where vertices have not only
private edges but also private attributes. We also discuss open problems on
attributed public-private graphs. Preliminary experimental results on our
generated real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of
public-private models and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Model (SM) with a scalar singlet ($S$) and three vectorlike fermions: two
singlets ($\chi_1,\chi_2$) and a doublet ($N$). Stability of the two DM
components is achieved by a discrete $\mathcal{Z}_2 \times
{\mathcal{Z}^\prime}_2$ symmetry, under which the additional fields transform
suitably. Fermion fields having same $\mathcal{Z}_2 \times
{\mathcal{Z}^\prime}_2$ charge ($N,\chi_1$ in the model) mix after electroweak
symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the lightest component becomes one of the DM
candidates, while scalar singlet $S$ is the other DM component connected to
visible sector by Higgs portal coupling. The heavy fermion ($\chi_2$) plays the
role of mediator to connect the two DM candidates through Yukawa interaction.
This opens up a large parameter space for the heavier DM component through
DM-DM conversion. Hadronically quiet dilepton signature, arising from the
fermion dark sector, can be observed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) aided by
the presence of a lighter scalar DM component, satisfying relic density and
direct search bounds through DM-DM conversion.

computing systems. Although a wide-range of defense techniques have been
developed against these attacks, the existing mitigation strategies have
several limitations. In particular, most of the existing mitigation approaches
are based on aborting or restarting the victim program when a memory-safety
attack is detected, thus making the system unavailable. This might not be
acceptable in systems with stringent timing constraints, such as cyber-physical
systems (CPS), since the system unavailability leaves the control system in an
unsafe state. To address this problem, we propose CIMA -- a resilient and
light-weight mitigation technique that prevents invalid memory accesses at
runtime. CIMA manipulates the compiler-generated control flow graph to
automatically detect and bypass unsafe memory accesses at runtime, thereby
mitigating memory-safety attacks along the process. An appealing feature of
CIMA is that it also ensures system availability and resilience of the CPS even
under the presence of memory-safety attacks. To this end, we design our
experimental setup based on a realistic Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and
Secure Urban Transportation System (SecUTS) testbeds and evaluate the
effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach. The experimental results
reveal that CIMA handles memory-safety attacks effectively with low overhead.
Moreover, it meets the real-time constraints and physical-state resiliency of
the CPS under test.

there are a number of existing evaluation methods for natural language (NL) QA
systems, most of them consider only the final answers, limiting their utility
within a black box style evaluation. Herein, we propose a subdivided evaluation
approach to enable finer-grained evaluation of QA systems, and present an
evaluation tool which targets the NL question (NLQ) interpretation step, an
initial step of a QA pipeline. The results of experiments using two public
benchmark datasets suggest that we can get a deeper insight about the
performance of a QA system using the proposed approach, which should provide a
better guidance for improving the systems, than using black box style
approaches.

thanks to the simple empirical relation between their pulsation period and
their luminosity. They overlap with that of secondary distance indicators, such
as Type Ia supernovae, whose distance scale is tied to Cepheid luminosities.
However, the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation still lacks a calibration to
better than 5%. Using an original combination of interferometric astrometry
with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy, we measured the geometrical distance
d = 720.35+/-7.84 pc of the 3.33 d period Cepheid V1334 Cyg with an
unprecedented accuracy of +/-1 %, providing the most accurate distance for a
Cepheid. Placing this star in the P-L diagram provides an independent test of
existing period-luminosity relations. We show that the secondary star has a
significant impact on the integrated magnitude, particularly at visible
wavelengths. Binarity in future high precision calibrations of the P-L
relations is not negligible, at least in the short-period regime. Subtracting
the companion flux leaves V1334 Cyg in marginal agreement with existing
photometric-based P-L relations, indicating either an overall calibration bias

  Systems on Low-Voltage Distribution Networks","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Battery storage, particularly residential battery storage coupled with
rooftop PV, is emerging as an essential component of the smart grid technology
mix. However, including battery storage and other flexible resources like
electric vehicles and loads with thermal inertia into a probabilistic analysis
based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is challenging, because their operational
profiles are determined by computationally intensive optimization.
Additionally, MC analysis requires a large pool of statistically-representative
demand profiles to sample from. As a result, the analysis of the network impact
of PV-battery systems has attracted little attention in the existing
literature. To fill these knowledge gaps, this paper proposes a novel
probabilistic framework to study the impact of PV-battery systems on
low-voltage distribution networks. Specifically, the framework incorporates
home energy management(HEM) operational decisions within the MC time series
power flow analysis. First, using available smart meter data, we use a Bayesian
nonparametric model to generate statistically-representative synthetic demand
and PV profiles. Second, a policy function approximation that emulates battery
scheduling decisions is used to make the simulation of optimization-based HEM
feasible within the MC framework. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on
three representative low-voltage feeders, where the computation time to execute
our MC framework is 5% of that when using explicit optimization methods in each
MC sample. The assessment results show that uncoordinated battery scheduling
has a limited beneficial impact, which is against the conjecture that batteries
will serendipitously mitigate the technical problems induced by PV generation.

sub-optimality and incompleteness of the decoupled approach, but has not been

harmonious sampling, to perform the coupled approach mainly in difficult

Our method identifies such difficult regions through a low-dimensional base
space by utilizing a reachability map given the target end-effector pose and
narrow passage detected by generalized Voronoi diagram. For the rest of simple
regions, we perform sampling mainly on the base configurations with a

process noises on the different node signals can be correlated with each other.
In this situation the local module may need to be embedded in a MIMO
identification setup for arriving at a consistent estimate with maximum
likelihood properties. This requires the proper treatment of confounding
variables. The result is an algorithm that, based on the given network topology

pulses are highly circularly polarized. The auroral radio emission of HD142301
is characterized by a reversal of the sense of polarization as the star
rotates. The effective magnetic field curve of HD142301 is also available
making it possible to correlate the transition from the left to the right-hand
circular polarization sense (and vice-versa) of the auroral pulses with the
known orientation of the stellar magnetic field. The results presented in this
letter have implications for the estimation of the dominant magneto-ionic mode
amplified within the HD142301 magnetosphere.

results of multi-epoch VLBI observations, which determine the spatial and
three-dimensional kinematic structure of H2O masers associated with the water
fountain IRAS 18113-2503. The masers trace three pairs of high-velocity
(~150-300 km/s) bipolar bow shocks on a scale of 0.18'' (~2000 au). The
expansion velocities of the bow shocks exhibit an exponential decrease as a
function of distance from the central star, which can be explained by an
episodic, jet-driven outflow decelerating due to drag forces in a circumstellar
envelope. Using our model, we estimate an initial ejection velocity ~840 km/s,
a period for the ejections ~10 yr, with the youngest being ~12 yr old, and an
average envelope density within the H2O maser region n(H2) ~ 10^6 cm^(-3). We
hypothesize that IRAS 18113-2503 hosts a binary central star with a separation

molecular ices or refractory dust. To investigate this question, we have used
data and results of Herschel observations towards two protostellar sources: the
high-mass hot core of Orion KL, and the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422.
Towards Orion KL, our analysis of the molecular inventory of Crockett et al.
(2014) indicates that HCN is the organic molecule that contains by far the most
nitrogen, carrying $74_{-9}^{+5}\%$ of nitrogen-in-organics. Following this
evidence, we explore HCN towards IRAS 16293-2422, which we consider a solar
analog. Towards IRAS 16293-2422, we have reduced and analyzed Herschel spectra
of HCN, and fit these observations against ""jump"" abundance models of IRAS
16293-2422's protostellar envelope. We find an inner-envelope HCN abundance
$X_{\textrm{in}} = 5.9\pm0.7 \times 10^{-8}$ and an outer-envelope HCN
abundance $X_{\textrm{out}} = 1.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-9}$. We also find the
sublimation temperature of HCN to be $T_{\textrm{jump}} = 71 \pm 3$~K; this
measured $T_{\textrm{jump}}$ enables us to predict an HCN binding energy
$E_{\textrm{B}}/k = 3840 \pm 140$~K. Based on a comparison of the HCN/H2O ratio
in these protostars to N/H2O ratios in comets, we find that HCN (and, by
extension, other organics) in these protostars is incapable of providing the
total bulk N/H2O in comets. We suggest that refractory dust, not molecular
ices, was the bulk provider of nitrogen to comets. However, interstellar dust
is not known to have 15N enrichment, while high 15N enrichment is seen in both
nitrogen-bearing ices and in cometary nitrogen. This may indicate that these
15N-enriched ices were an important contributor to the nitrogen in
planetesimals and likely to the Earth.

to this formalism the system exhibits a quantum transition from superfluid to
cluster supersolid as a function of pressure. We develop a thermodynamically
rigorous treatment of the different phases of the system by adopting a
variational formulation of the condensate wave function --- represented as a
sum of Gaussians --- that is amenable to exact manipulations. Not only is this
description quantitatively accurate, but it is also capable to predict the
order (and sometimes even the location) of the transition. We consider a number
of crystal structures in two and three dimensions and determine the phase
diagram. Depending on the lattice, the transition from fluid to solid can be
first-order or continuous, a lower coordination entailing a milder transition.
In two dimensions, crystallization would occur at the same pressure on three
distinct lattices (square, honeycomb, and stripes), all providing metastable
phases with respect to the triangular crystal. A similar scenario holds in
three dimensions, where the simple-cubic and diamond crystals also share a
common melting point; however, the stable crystal at low pressure is typically
fcc. Upon compression and depending on the shape of the potential, the fcc
crystal may transform into hcp. We conclude by sketching a theory of the
solid-fluid interface and of quantum nucleation of the solid from the fluid.

decompositions when each $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal F_n$ is generated by
countably many atoms. Martingale inequalities and the relation of the different

maximal Fej{\'e}r operator on $H_{p(\cdot)}$ and $H_{p(\cdot),q}$ is proved
whenever $p_->1/2$ and the condition $\frac{1}{p_-}-\frac{1}{p_+} <1$ hold. It
is surprising that this last condition does not appear for trigonometric

dyadic maximal operators and prove their boundedness on $L_{p(\cdot)}$ with
$p_->1$. The method we use to prove these results is new even in the classical

algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate
bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the
environment. We precompute the wedges of a reconstructed mesh of an indoor
scene and use them to generate diffraction acoustic rays to localize the 3D
position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those
generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle
filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a
static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can
localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by
the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m
room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a

description of the Galaxy's large-scale magnetic field, which is widely used in

divergence constraint is violated. We first propose a cure for this problem,
resulting in a truly solenoidal large-scale spiral field. Second, the otherwise
straight field lines of the X-type component exhibit kinks in the Galactic

may pose difficulties for e.g., numerical tracing of cosmic-ray particles. We
propose and discuss two possible strategies to mitigate this problem. Although
all corrections are kept as minimal as possible, the extended set of model
parameters will have to be carefully readjusted in order to fully restore the
agreement to observational data that the unmodified JF12 field is based on.
Furthermore, the performance of our improved version of the field model is
quantitatively assessed by test simulations using the CRPropa Galactic

improve image quality. However, conventional adaptive optics can only correct a
single phase aberration for the whole field of view (isoplanatic correction)
while, due to the three dimensional nature of biological tissues, sample
induced aberrations in microscopy often vary throughout the field of view
(anisoplanatic aberration), limiting significantly the effectiveness of
adaptive optics. This paper reports on a new approach for aberration correction
in laser scanning confocal microscopy, in which a spatial light modulator is
used to generate multiple excitation points in the sample to simultaneously
scan different portions of the field of view with completely independent
correction, achieving anisoplanatic compensation of sample induced aberrations.
The method was tested in 150 {\mu}m thick whole Drosophila brains, showing a
dramatic improvement in resolution and sharpness when compared to conventional

computational complexity, previous works have proposed to approximate the von

  In this paper we aim to answer these questions by first analysing and
comparing the quadratic approximations of the two variants and then performing
an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs. We
find that 1) the two entropies lead to the emergence of similar structures, but
with some significant differences; 2) the correlation between them ranges from
weakly positive to strongly negative, depending on the topology of the
underlying graph; 3) the quadratic approximations fail to capture the presence
of non-trivial structural patterns that seem to influence the value of the
exact entropies; 4) the quality of the approximations, as well as which variant
of the von Neumann entropy is better approximated, depends on the topology of
the underlying graph.

copies of the structure by removing a negligible amount of edges incident to
every vertex. In this paper we generalise the notion of local resilience to
$H$-resilience and demonstrate its usefulness on the containment problem of the
square of a Hamilton cycle. In particular, we show that there exists a constant
$C > 0$ such that if $p \geq C\log^3 n/\sqrt{n}$ then w.h.p. in every subgraph
$G$ of a random graph $G_{n, p}$ there exists the square of a Hamilton cycle,

of $p$ slightly improves on the best-known appearance threshold of such a

with low signaling overhead that provides significant benefits in increasing
the channel reuse efficiency. Since user equipment (UE) detection and channel
estimation in grant-free RA rely solely on the received preambles, preamble
designs that enable high success rate of UE detection and channel estimation
are very much in need to ensure the performance gain of grant-free RA with
massive MIMO. In this paper, a super preamble consisting of multiple
consecutive preambles is proposed for high success rate of grant-free RA with
massive MIMO. With the proposed approach, the success of UE detection and
channel estimation for a RA UE depends on two conditions: 1) it is a solvable
UE; 2) its super preamble is detected. Accordingly, we theoretically analyze
the solvable rate of RA UEs with multiple preambles and propose a reliable UE
detection algorithm to obtain the super preambles of RA UEs by exploiting the
quasi-orthogonality characteristic of massive MIMO. Theoretical analysis and
simulation results show that turning a preamble into a super preamble
consisting of two or three shorter preambles, the success rate of UE detection

mobilities that led to the observation of the integer quantum Hall effect, the
improvement in the sample quality of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) has however
been only moderate; quantum Hall effect remained elusive. Here, we obtain high
quality black phosphorus 2DEG by defining the 2DEG region with a prepatterned
graphite local gate. The graphite local gate screens the impurity potential in
the 2DEG. More importantly, it electrostatically defines the edge of the 2DEG,
which facilitates the formation of well-defined edge channels in the quantum
Hall regime. The improvements enable us to observe precisely quantized Hall
plateaus in electron-doped black phosphorus FET. Magneto-transport measurements

turbulence is investigated by the method of line segments (M. Gauding et al.,
Physics of Fluids 27.9 (2015): 095102). The analysis is based on a highly
resolved direct numerical simulation of decaying turbulence. The method of line
segments is used to perform a decomposition of the scalar field into smaller
sub-units based on the extremal points of the scalar along a straight line.
These sub-units (the so-called line segments) are parameterized by their length
$\ell$ and the difference $\Delta\phi$ of the scalar field between the ending
points. Line segments can be understood as thin local convective-diffusive
structures in which diffusive processes are enhanced by compressive strain.
From DNS, it is shown that the marginal distribution function of the
length~$\ell$ assumes complete self-similarity when re-scaled by the mean
length $\ell_m$. The joint statistics of $\Delta\phi$ and $\ell$, from which
the local gradient $g=\Delta\phi/\ell$ can be defined, play an important role
in understanding the turbulence mixing and flow structure. Large values of $g$
occur at a small but finite length scale. Statistics of $g$ are characterized
by rare but strong deviations that exceed the standard deviation by more than
one order of magnitude. It is shown that these events break complete
self-similarity of line segments, which confirms the standard paradigm of
turbulence that intense events (which are known as internal intermittency) are

energetically forbidden transitions from the simulations. Calculated initial

subject to a penalty if she trades. We establish existence and uniqueness of
equilibrium for virtually any penalty function when noise is uniform. In
equilibrium, the demand of the insider and the price functions are in general
non-linear and remain analytically tractable because the expected price
function is linear. We use this result to investigate the trade off between
price efficiency and 'fairness': we consider a regulator that wants to minimise
post-trade standard deviation for a given level of uninformed traders' losses.
The minimisation is over the function space of penalties; for each possible
penalty, our existence and uniqueness theorem allows to define unambiguously
the post-trade standard deviation and the uninformed traders' losses that
prevail in equilibrium.Optimal penalties are characterized in closed-form. They
must increase quickly with the magnitude of the insider's order for small
orders and become flat for large orders: in cases where the fundamental
realizes at very high or very low values, the insider finds it optimal to trade
despite the high penalty. Although such trades-if they occur-are costly for
liquidity traders, they signal extreme events and therefore incorporate a lot
of information into prices. We generalize this result in two directions by
imposing a budget constraint on the regulator and considering the cases of
either non-pecuniary or pecuniary penalties. In the first case, we establish
that optimal penalties are a subset of the previously optimal penalties: the
patterns of equilibrium trade volumes and prices is unchanged. In the second
case, we also fully characterize the constrained efficient points and penalties
and show that new patterns emerge in the demand schedules of the insider trader
and the associated price functions.

conditions and requirements. The required computations impose clear constraints
on their fine-tuning: a rapid and maximally informative response to stimuli in
general requires decorrelated baseline neural activity. Such network dynamics
is known as asynchronous-irregular. In contrast, spatio-temporal integration of
information requires maintenance and transfer of stimulus information over
extended time periods. This can be realized at criticality, a phase transition
where correlations, sensitivity and integration time diverge. Being able to
flexibly switch, or even combine the above properties in a task-dependent
manner would present a clear functional advantage. We propose that cortex
operates in a ""reverberating regime"" because it is particularly favorable for
ready adaptation of computational properties to context and task. This
reverberating regime enables cortical networks to interpolate between the
asynchronous-irregular and the critical state by small changes in effective
synaptic strength or excitation-inhibition ratio. These changes directly adapt
computational properties, including sensitivity, amplification, integration
time and correlation length within the local network. We review recent
converging evidence that cortex in vivo operates in the reverberating regime,
and that various cortical areas have adapted their integration times to
processing requirements. In addition, we propose that neuromodulation enables a
fine-tuning of the network, so that local circuits can either decorrelate or
integrate, and quench or maintain their input depending on task. We argue that
this task-dependent tuning, which we call ""dynamic adaptive computation"",
presents a central organization principle of cortical networks and discuss
first experimental evidence.

Paranal containing over 10000 measurements of the turbulence profile from 83

clusters, resulting in two sets of 18 profiles providing subtly different
descriptions of the variability across the entire dataset. For generality we
choose integrated parameters of the turbulence to measure the
representativeness of our profiles and compare to others. Using these criterion
we also show that such variability is difficult to capture with small sets of

$\mathcal{O}_0$ of some domain $\Omega$ and its complement $\mathcal{O}_1 =

objects subject to a set of loading scenarios. If one asks for a configuration
which minimizes the maximal elastic cost functional both phases compete for
space since elastic shapes usually get mechanically more stable when being
enlarged. Such a problem arises in biomechanics where a bioresorbable polymer
scaffold is implanted in place of lost bone tissue and in a regeneration phase
new bone tissue grows in the scaffold complement via osteogenesis. In fact, the
polymer scaffold should be mechanically stable to bear loading in the early
stage regeneration phase and at the same time the new bone tissue grown in the
complement of this scaffold should as well bear the loading. Here, this optimal
subdomain splitting problem with appropriate elastic cost functionals is
introduced and existence of optimal two phase configurations is established for
a regularized formulation. Furthermore, based on a phase field approximation a
finite element discretization is derived. Numerical experiments are presented

relatively broad (compared to other low-frequency QPOs; quality factor
$Q\approx 2$) and weak (1.9% rms in 3-10 keV), and is accompanied by a weak
harmonic and low-amplitude broadband noise. These characteristics identify it
as a weak Type A/B QPO, similar to ones previously identified in the
soft-intermediate state of the transient black hole X-ray binary XTE J1550-564.
The lag-energy spectrum of the QPO shows increasing soft lags towards lower

This large phase shift has similar amplitude but opposite sign to that seen in

behave as a cohesive whole, which can be useful in tasks such as collaborative
transportation. The robustness of the algorithm relies on the fact that each
robot employs only local measurements from a laser sensor which does not need
to be off-line calibrated. Furthermore, robots do not need to exchange any
information with each other. Being free of sensor calibration and not requiring
a communication channel helps the scaling of the overall system to a large
number of robots. In addition, since the robots do not need any off-board
localization system, but require only relative positions with respect to their
neighbors, it can be aimed to have a full autonomous team that operates in
environments where such localization systems are not available. The
computational cost of the algorithm is inexpensive and the resources from a
standard microcontroller will suffice. This fact makes the usage of our
approach appealing as a support for other more demanding algorithms, e.g.,

consider the relevant case of the quadratic correction to the Hilbert-Palatini

depending on the sign of such correction, able to reproduce bouncing settings
and to restore the standard Universe dynamics in the late asymptotic limit.
Furthermore, we outline the settling of Little-Rip dynamics, which calls for a
deeper investigation in order to be regularized via matter creation. Finally,
we also show that in our model the Immirzi field is asymptotically frozen in

states at their interfaces. Due to topological protection, such edge states
persist in the presence of disorder and do not experience backscattering upon
interaction with defects. We show that despite the topological protection and
the fact that such states at the opposite edges of a ribbon carry opposite
currents, there exists a physical mechanism allowing to resonantly couple
topological excitations propagating at opposite edges. Such mechanism uses weak
periodic temporal modulations of the system parameters and does not affect the
internal symmetry and topology of the system. We study this mechanism in
truncated honeycomb arrays of microcavity pillars, where topological insulation
is possible for polaritons under the combined action of spin-orbit coupling and
Zeeman splitting in the external magnetic field. The temporal modulation of the
potential leads to a periodic switching between topological states with the
same Bloch momentum, but located at the opposite edges. The switching rate is
found to increase for narrower ribbon structures and for larger modulation
depth, though it is changing nonmonotonically with the Bloch momentum of the
input edge state. Our results provide a promising realization of a coupling
device based on topologically protected states. The proposed scheme can be used
in other topological photonic and condensed matter systems, including Floquet

However, multiple problems and uncertainties need to be solved before these

problem hindering the application of mobile phone data in official statistics:
detecting home locations. We argue that current efforts to detect home
locations suffer from a blind deployment of criteria to define a place of
residence and from limited validation possibilities. We support our argument by
analysing the performance of five home detection algorithms (HDAs) that have
been applied to a large, French, Call Detailed Record (CDR) dataset (~18
million users, 5 months). Our results show that criteria choice in HDAs
influences the detection of home locations for up to about 40% of users, that
HDAs perform poorly when compared with a validation dataset (the 35{\deg}-gap),
and that their performance is sensitive to the time period and the duration of
observation. Based on our findings and experiences, we offer several
recommendations for official statistics. If adopted, our recommendations would
help in ensuring a more reliable use of mobile phone data vis-\`a-vis official

sub-stellar companion (Pi Men b) on a long-period (Porb = 2091 days), eccentric
(e = 0.64) orbit. Using TESS time-series photometry, combined with Gaia data,
published UCLES@AAT Doppler measurements, and archival HARPS@ESO-3.6m radial
velocities, we found that Pi Men c is a close-in planet with an orbital period
of Porb = 6.27 days, a mass of Mc = 4.52 +/- 0.81 MEarth, and a radius of Rc =
2.06 +/- 0.03 REarth. Based on the planet's orbital period and size, Pi Men c
is a super-Earth located at, or close to, the radius gap, while its mass and
bulk density suggest it may have held on to a significant atmosphere. Because
of the brightness of the host star, this system is highly suitable for a wide
range of further studies to characterize the planetary atmosphere and dynamical
properties. We also performed an asteroseismic analysis of the TESS data and
detected a hint of power excess consistent with the seismic values expected for
this star, although this result depends on the photometric aperture used to
extract the light curve. This marginal detection is expected from pre-launch
simulations hinting at the asteroseismic potential of the TESS mission for
longer, multi-sector observations and/or for more evolved bright stars.

concentric spherical cells of various sizes were derived from these DPKS using
appropriate geometric reduction factors. The number of Auger and Coster-Kronig
(CK) electrons and x-ray photons released per nuclear decay (yield) from

DPKs for the electron spectra from BrIccEmis were considerably different from
MIRD-RADTABS in the first few hundred nanometres from a point source where most
of the Auger electrons are stopped. S-values were, however, not significantly
impacted as the differences in DPKS in the sub-micrometre dimension were
quickly diminished in larger dimensions. Overestimation in the total AE energy
output by MIRD-RADTABS leads to higher predicted energy deposition by AE
emitting radionuclides, especially in the immediate vicinity of the decaying
radionuclides. This should be taken into account when MIRD-RADTABS data are
used to simulate biological damage at nanoscale dimensions.

stars is one of the main contributors to the chemical enrichment of galaxies.
The general hypothesis of the mass loss mechanism of AGB winds is a combination
of stellar pulsations and radiative pressure on dust grains, yet current models
still suffer from limitations. Among others, they assume chemical equilibrium
of the gas, which may not be justified due to rapid local dynamical changes in
the wind. This is important as it is the chemical composition that regulates
the thermal structure of the wind, the creation of dust grains in the wind, and
ultimately the mass loss by the wind. Using a self-consistent hydrochemical
model, we investigated how non-equilibrium chemistry affects the dynamics of
the wind. This paper compares a hydrodynamical and a hydrochemical dust-free
wind, with focus on the chemical heating and cooling processes. No sustainable
wind arises in a purely hydrodynamical model with physically reasonable
pulsations. Moreover, temperatures are too high for dust formation to happen,
rendering radiative pressure on grains impossible. A hydrochemical wind is even
harder to initiate due to efficient chemical cooling. However, temperatures are
sufficiently low in dense regions for dust formation to take place. These
regions occur close to the star, which is needed for radiation pressure on dust
to sufficiently aid in creating a wind. Extending this model self-consistently
with dust formation and evolution, and including radiation pressure, will help
to understand the mass loss by AGB winds.

distinct from Skyrmion crystals discussed under the same symmetry. Our results

learning approaches commonly leveraged in remote sensing field fail to take
advantage of spatio-temporal dependencies present in such data.
  Recently, new generation deep learning methods allowed to significantly
advance research in this field. These approaches have generally focused on a
single type of neural network, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which model different but complementary

the underlying land cover classification task. Experiments carried out on two
study sites characterized by different land cover characteristics (i.e., the
\textit{Gard} site in France and the \textit{Reunion Island} in the Indian

velocity-coherent (trans-)sonic structure, a large part of which is one of the
most quiescent regions in the Serpens cloud. Widespread C$^{18}$O depletion is
found throughout the Serpens filament. Based on the Herschel dust-derived
H$_{2}$ column density map, the line mass of the filament is
36--41~M$_{\odot}$~pc$^{-1}$, and its full width at half maximum is
0.17$\pm$0.01~pc, while its length is ~1.6~pc. The inner radial column density
profile of this filament can be well fitted with a Plummer profile with an
exponent of 2.2$\pm$0.1, a scale radius of $0.018\pm 0.003$ pc, and a central
density of $(4.0\pm 0.8)\times 10^{4}$~cm$^{-3}$. The Serpens filament appears
to be slightly supercritical. The widespread blue-skewed HNC and CS line
profiles and HCN hyperfine line anomalies across this filament indicate radial
infall in parts of the Serpens filament. C$^{18}$O velocity gradients also
indicate accretion flows along the filament. The velocity and density
structures suggest that such accretion flows are likely due to a longitudinal
collapse parallel to the filament's long axis. Both the radial infall rate and
the longitudinal accretion rate along the Serpens filament are lower than all
previously reported values in other filaments. This indicates that the Serpens
filament lies at an early evolutionary stage when collapse has just begun, or
that thermal and non-thermal support are effective in providing support against
gravity.

abundance gradients and other galactic features using the revised solar
abundance. The galaxy is accreted gradually by using either a two-infall or a
three-infall accretion scenario. The galaxy is chemically enriched by the
nucleosynthetic contributions from an evolving ensemble of generations of
stars. We analyse the role of star formation efficiency. The influence of the
radial gas inflow as well as radial gas mixing on the evolution of galaxy is
also studied. The SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD) is incorporated by
synthesizing SN Ia populations using random numbers based on a distribution
function. The elemental abundance evolutionary trends corroborate fractional
contributions of ~0.1 from prompt ( < 100 Myr) SN Ia population. The models
predict steep gradients in the inner regions and less steep gradients in the
outer regions which agrees with the observations. The gradients indicate an
average radial gas mixing velocity of < 1 km/s. The models with radial gas
inflows reproduce the observed inversion in the elemental abundance gradients
around 2 billion years. The three-infall accretion scenario performs better
than the two-infall accretion model in terms of explaining the elemental
abundance distributions of the galactic halo, thick and thin discs. The
accuracy of all the models has been monitored as a cumulative error of < 0.15 M
in the mass balance calculations during the entire evolution of the galaxy.

$\mathit{Sc}=1$. Direct numerical simulations (DNS), in a range of Reynolds
numbers $R_\lambda \in [88,529]$ are used to assess the validity of these

involved terms pertain to molecular diffusion, transport, production, and
dissipative-fluxes. The latter term, present at all scales, is equal to: i) the
mean scalar variance dissipation rate, $\langle \chi \rangle$, for the
second-order moments transport equation; ii) non-linear correlations between
$\chi$ and second-order moments of the scalar increment, for the fourth-order

similarity scales (i.e., variables which allow for perfect collapse of the

consistent with Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin (KOC) theory. However, for
higher-order moments, adequate similarity scales are built from $\langle \chi^n

power of such systems requires programming parallel applications that are
hybrid in two meanings: they can utilize parallelism on multiple levels at the
same time and combine together programming interfaces specific for various
types of computing devices.
  The main goal of parallel processing is increasing the processing
performance, and therefore decreasing the application execution time. The
international HPC community is targeting development of ""Exascale""
supercomputers (able to sustain $10^{18}$ floating point operations per second)
by the year 2020. One of the main obstacles to achieving this goal is power
consumption of the computing systems that exceeds the energy supply limits. New
programming models and algorithms that consider this criterion are one of the
key areas where significant progress is necessary in order to achieve the goal.
  The goal of the dissertation is to extract a general model of hybrid parallel
application execution in heterogeneous HPC systems that is a synthesis of
existing specific approaches and developing an optimization methodology for
such execution aiming for minimization of the contradicting objectives of
application execution time and power consumption of the utilized computing
hardware. Both meanings of the application hybridity result in multiplicity of
execution parameters of nontrivial interdependences and influence on the
considered optimization criteria. Mapping of the application processes on
computing devices has also a significant impact on these criteria.

With such a single device, electron vortex beams that are defined by a wide
range of topological charges can be produced by means of a slight variation of
an applied voltage. For this reason, this device is expected to be important in
applications that rely on the sequential generation and manipulation of

interstellar extinction and extreme source crowding. Sensitive high angular
resolution near-infrared imaging is needed to study stellar populations in such
a complex environment. We use the 0.2$''$ angular resolution $JHK_s$ data from
the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey to study the stellar population within two
$8.0'\times 3.4'$ fields, about 0.6$^\circ$ and 0.4$^\circ$ to the Galactic
north of the Milky Way's centre and to compare it with one in the immediate
surroundings of Sagittarius A*. We also characterise the extinction curve of
the two fields. The average interstellar extinction to the outer and the inner
field is $A_{K_s} \sim 1.20 \pm 0.08$ mag and $\sim 1.48 \pm 0.10$ mag,
respectively. We present $K_{s}$ luminosity functions that are complete down to
at least 2 mag below the red clump (RC). We detect a feature in the luminosity
functions that is fainter than the RC by $0.80\pm0.03$ and $0.79\pm0.02$ mag,
respectively, in the $K_s$-band. It runs parallel to the reddening vector. We
identify the feature as the red giant branch bump. Fitting $\alpha$-enhanced
BaSTI luminosity functions to our data, we find that a single old stellar
population of $\sim12.8 \pm 0.6$ Gyr and $Z = 0.040 \pm 0.003$ provides the
best fit. We obtain that the stellar population in the innermost bulge is old,
similar to the one at larger distances from the Galactic plane, and that its
metallicity increases down to distances as short as about 60 pc from the centre
of the Milky Way. Comparing it with previous known values at larger latitudes
($|b|>2^\circ$), our results favour a flattening of the gradient at
$|b|<2^\circ$. As a secondary result we obtain that the extinction index in the
studied regions agrees the value of $\alpha = 2.30\pm0.08$, derived in
Nogueras-Lara et al. 2018 for the very Galactic centre.

Waals layered materials such as graphene. Its fundamental mechanism, inertial
cavitation, is poorly understood and often ignored in ultrasonication
strategies resulting in low exfoliation rates, low material yields and wide
flake size distributions, making the graphene dispersions produced by
ultrasonication less economically viable. Here we report that few-layer
graphene yields of up to 18% in three hours without introduction of basal plane
defects can be achieved by optimising inertial cavitation during
ultrasonication. We demonstrate that the yield and the graphene flake
dimensions exhibit a power law relationship with inertial cavitation dose.
Furthermore, inertial cavitation is shown to preferentially exfoliate larger
graphene flakes which causes the exfoliation rate to decrease as a function of
sonication time. This study demonstrates that measurement and control of
inertial cavitation is critical in optimising the high yield
sonication-assisted aqueous liquid phase exfoliation of size-selected
nanomaterials. Future development of this method should lead to the development
of high volume flow cell production of 2D van der Waals layered nanomaterials.

way, an adaptation-based estimation law is established for each robotic agent

analyzed in detail to lay a solid foundation for tight cooperation tasks.
Together with the estimated task, a set of distributed adaptive controllers is
proposed to achieve motion synchronization of the mobile manipulator ensemble
over a directed graph with a spanning tree irrespective of the kinematic and
dynamic uncertainties in both the mobile manipulators and the tightly grasped
object. The controlled synchronization alleviates the performance degradation
caused by the estimation/tracking discrepancy during the transient phase. The
proposed scheme requires no persistent excitation condition and avoids the use
of noisy Cartesian-space velocities. Furthermore, it is independent from the
object's center of mass by employing formation-based task allocation and a
task-oriented strategy. These attractive attributes facilitate the practical
application of the scheme. It is theoretically proven that convergence of the
cooperative task tracking error is guaranteed. Simulation results validate the
efficacy and demonstrate the expected performance of the proposed scheme.

age, calcium abundance and the initial mass function has not yet been

We derive empirical calibrations between the CaT index and both the iron

relationship for [Ca/H] than for [Fe/H]. For stellar populations 3 Gyr and
older the CaT can be used to reliably measure [Ca/H] at the 0.1 dex level but
becomes less reliable for ages of $\sim 2$ Gyr and younger. We find that the
CaT is relatively insensitive to the horizontal branch morphology. The stellar
mass function however affects the CaT strengths significantly only at low
metallicities. Using our newly derived empirical calibration, we convert our

uncertainty associated with the predictions of a machine-learning model of
atomic and molecular properties. The scheme is based on resampling, with
multiple models being generated based on sub-sampling of the same training
data. The accuracy of the uncertainty prediction can be benchmarked by maximum
likelihood estimation, which can also be used to correct for correlations
between resampled models, and to improve the performance of the uncertainty
estimation by a cross-validation procedure. In the case of sparse Gaussian
Process Regression models, this resampled estimator can be evaluated at
negligible cost. We demonstrate the reliability of these estimates for the
prediction of molecular energetics, and for the estimation of nuclear chemical
shieldings in molecular crystals. Extension to estimate the uncertainty in
energy differences, forces, or other correlated predictions is straightforward.
This method can be easily applied to other machine learning schemes, and will
be beneficial to make data-driven predictions more reliable, and to facilitate
training-set optimization and active-learning strategies.

nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane and containing both the Sun and
Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream provides a powerful means by
which to measure the solar reflex velocity, and thereby infer the velocity of
the Local Standard of Rest (LSR), in a way that is independent of assumptions
about the solar Galactocentric distance. Moreover, the solar reflex velocity
with respect to the stream is projected almost entirely into the proper motion
component of Sgr stream stars perpendicular to the Sgr plane, which makes the
inferred velocity relatively immune to most Sgr model assumptions. Using Gaia
DR2 proper motions of ~2,000 stars identified to be Sgr stream candidates in
concert with the Law and Majewski (2010) Sgr N-body models (which provide a
good match to the Gaia observations) we constrain the solar reflex velocity
induced by its orbital motion around the Galaxy to be $\Theta_{\odot} = 253 \pm
6$ km/s. Assuming a solar peculiar motion in the direction of orbital rotation
of 12 km/s, and an LSR velocity of 12 km/s with respect to the local circular
speed, the implied circular speed of the Milky Way at the solar circle is $229
\pm 6$ km/s.

single neuron revolution emerged in neuroscience in the 1970s. They brought
many unexpected discoveries, including grandmother or concept cells and sparse
coding of information in the brain.
  In machine learning for a long time, the famous curse of dimensionality
seemed to be an unsolvable problem. Nevertheless, the idea of the blessing of
dimensionality becomes gradually more and more popular. Ensembles of
non-interacting or weakly interacting simple units prove to be an effective
tool for solving essentially multidimensional problems. This approach is
especially useful for one-shot (non-iterative) correction of errors in large
legacy artificial intelligence systems.
  These simplicity revolutions in the era of complexity have deep fundamental
reasons grounded in geometry of multidimensional data spaces. To explore and
understand these reasons we revisit the background ideas of statistical
physics. In the course of the 20th century they were developed into the
concentration of measure theory. New stochastic separation theorems reveal the
fine structure of the data clouds.
  We review and analyse biological, physical, and mathematical problems at the
core of the fundamental question: how can high-dimensional brain organise
reliable and fast learning in high-dimensional world of data by simple tools?
  Two critical applications are reviewed to exemplify the approach: one-shot
correction of errors in intellectual systems and emergence of static and
associative memories in ensembles of single neurons.

situations is of importance in designing and managing workplaces, but also in
other areas of society such as disaster management or professional sports. For
simple effort tasks, an increase in the pressure experienced by an individual,
e.g. due to incentive schemes in a workplace, will increase the effort put into
the task and hence in most cases also the performance. For the more complex and
usually harder to capture case of skill tasks, there exists a substantial body
of literature that fairly consistently reports a choking phenomenon under
pressure. However, we argue that many of the corresponding studies have crucial
limitations, such as neglected interaction effects or insufficient numbers of
observations to allow within-individual analysis. Here, we investigate
performance under pressure in professional darts as a near-ideal setting with
no direct interaction between players and a high number of observations per
subject. We analyze almost one year of tournament data covering 23,192 dart
throws, hence a data set that is very much larger than those used in most
previous studies. Contrary to what would be expected given the evidence in
favor of a choking phenomenon, we find strong evidence for an overall improved
performance under pressure, for nearly all 83 players in the sample. These
results could have important consequences for our understanding of how highly
skilled individuals deal with high-pressure situations.

observe and record the magnetodynamics of the nanomagnets that form the
junctions themselves. To counteract the bandwidth limitations caused by the
high impedance of the junction and the parasitic capacitance intrinsic to any
cryogenic system, silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors (SiGe
HBTs) are used as cryogenic preamplifiers for the MTJs. The resulting
measurement improvements include an increase in bandwidth by a factor of 3.89,
an increase in signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 6.62, and a gain of 7.75 of
the TMR signal produced by the MTJ. The limitation to the measurement system
was found to be from the external, room temperature electronics. Despite this
limitation, these improvements allow for better time-resolved magnetodynamics
measurements of the MTJs. These experiments pave the way for future cryogenic,
magnetodynamics measurement improvements, and could even be useful in cryogenic

nature, FDM exhibits stochastic density fluctuations on the scale of the de
Broglie wavelength that never damp. The gravitational field from these
fluctuations scatters stars and black holes, causing their orbits to diffuse
through phase space. We show that this relaxation process can be analyzed
quantitatively with the same tools used to analyze classical two-body
relaxation in an $N$-body system, and can be described by treating the FDM

dynamical friction at radii of a few hundred pc, and can heat and expand the
central regions of galaxies. These processes can be used to constrain the mass

cluster members from the ACReS Hectospec survey covering a region which
corresponds to about three virial radii for each cluster. We measure fluxes of
five emission lines of cluster members enabling us to unambiguously derive O/H
gas metallicities, and also SFRs from extinction corrected Halpha fluxes. We
compare our cluster galaxy sample with a field sample of 705 galaxies at
similar redshifts observed with Hectospec. We find that star-forming cluster
and field galaxies show similar median specific SFRs in a given mass bin, but
their O/H values are displaced to higher values at projected radii of R<R200
compared with galaxies at larger radii and in the field. The comparison with
metallicity-SFR-mass model predictions with inflowing gas indicates a
slow-quenching scenario in which strangulation is initiated when galaxies pass
R~R200 by stopping the inflow of gas. The metallicities of cluster members
inside R200 are thereby increasing, but their SFRs are hardly affected for a
period of time, because these galaxies consume available disk gas. We use the
fraction of star-forming cluster galaxies as a function of clustercentric
radius compared to predictions from the Millennium simulation to constrain
quenching timescales to be 1-2Gyrs. This is consistent with a slow-then-rapid
quenching scenario. Slow quenching (strangulation) starts when the gas inflow
is stopped when the galaxy passes R200 with a phase in which cluster galaxies
are still star-forming, but they show elevated metallicities tracing the
ongoing quenching. This phase lasts for 1-2Gyrs, meanwhile the galaxies travel
to denser inner regions of the cluster, and is followed by a ""rapid"" phase: a
rapid complete quenching of star formation due to the increasing ram-pressure
towards the cluster center which can also strip the cold gas in massive
galaxies.

fragmented. This phenomenon is rooted in the underlying complex structure and
dynamics of social systems. Far from homogeneously mixing or adopting
conforming views, individuals self-organize into groups at multiple scales,
ranging from families up to cities and cultures. In this paper, we study the
fragmented structure of the American society using mobility and communication
networks obtained from geo-located social media data. We find self-organized
patches with clear geographical borders that are consistent between physical
and virtual spaces. The patches have multi-scale structure ranging from parts
of a city up to the entire nation. Their significance is reflected in distinct
patterns of collective interests and conversations. Finally, we explain the
patch emergence by a model of network growth that combines mechanisms of
geographical distance gravity, preferential attachment, and spatial growth. Our
observations are consistent with the emergence of social groups whose separated
association and communication reinforce distinct identities. Rather than
eliminating borders, the virtual space reproduces them as people mirror their
offline lives online. Understanding the mechanisms driving the emergence of
fragmentation in hyper-connected social systems is imperative in the age of the
Internet and globalization.

with a viscosity ratio up to 15 is analyzed by means of highly resolved direct
numerical simulations (DNS) at low Reynolds numbers. The question addressed by
the present work is how quantities such as the kinetic energy and the
associated dissipation rate, as well as the inter-scale transport mechanism of
turbulence are changed by local fluctuations of the viscosity. From the
one-point budget equation of the turbulent kinetic energy, it is shown that the
mean dissipation rate is nearly unchanged by variable viscosity effects. This
result is explained by a negative correlation between the local viscosity and
the local velocity gradients. However, the dissipation is a highly fluctuating
quantity with a strong level of intermittency. From a statistical analysis it
is shown that turbulent flows with variable viscosity are characterized by an
enhanced level of small-scale intermittency, which results in the presence of
smaller length scales and a modified turbulent mixing. The effect of variable
viscosity on the turbulent cascade is analyzed by a budget equation for the
velocity structure function. From DNS it is shown that viscosity gradients
contribute to the inter-scale transport mechanism in the form of an inverse
transport, where information propagates from the small scales to the large
scales.

Remarkably, environmental noise can enhance the transport, an effect known as
environment-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT). In this paper, we study ENAQT
in a network of coupled spins subject to engineered static disorder and
temporally varying dephasing noise. The interacting spin network is realized in
a chain of trapped atomic ions and energy transport is represented by the
transfer of electronic excitation between ions. With increasing noise strength,
we observe a crossover from coherent dynamics and Anderson localization to
ENAQT and finally a suppression of transport due to the quantum Zeno effect. We
found that in the regime where ENAQT is most effective the transport is mainly
diffusive, displaying coherences only at very short times. Further, we show
that dephasing characterized by non-Markovian noise can maintain coherences
longer than white noise dephasing, with a strong influence of the spectral
structure on the transport effciency. Our approach represents a controlled and
scalable way to investigate quantum transport in many-body networks under
static disorder and dynamic noise.

(SWIPT) is a promising solution to maximize the energy efficiency. In this
paper, for the first time, we investigate the integration of SWIPT in mmWave
massive MIMO-NOMA systems. As mmWave massive MIMO will likely use hybrid
precoding (HP) to significantly reduce the number of required radio-frequency
(RF) chains without an obvious performance loss, where the fully digital
precoder is decomposed into a high-dimensional analog precoder and a
low-dimensional digital precoder, we propose to apply SWIPT in HP-based
MIMO-NOMA systems, where each user can extract both information and energy from
the received RF signals by using a power splitting receiver. Specifically, the
cluster-head selection (CHS) algorithm is proposed to select one user for each
beam at first, and then the analog precoding is designed according to the
selected cluster heads for all beams. After that, user grouping is performed
based on the correlation of users' equivalent channels. Then, the digital
precoding is designed by selecting users with the strongest equivalent channel
gain in each beam. Finally, the achievable sum rate is maximized by jointly
optimizing power allocation for mmWave massive MIMO-NOMA and power splitting
factors for SWIPT, and an iterative optimization algorithm is developed to
solve the non-convex problem. Simulation results show that the proposed
HP-based MIMO-NOMA with SWIPT can achieve higher spectrum and energy efficiency
compared with HP-based MIMO-OMA with SWIPT.

with the latest version of the model developed in CI2018 and called the ELVG
(the Expanded Local Variance Gamma model), here we provide two innovations.
First, in all previous papers the model was constructed based on a Gamma
time-changed {\it arithmetic} Brownian motion: with no drift in CI2017, and
with drift in CI2018, and the local variance to be a function of the spot level
only. In contrast, here we develop a {\it geometric} version of this model with
drift. Second, in CN2017 the model was calibrated to option smiles assuming the
local variance is a piecewise constant function of strike, while in CI2018 the
local variance is a piecewise linear} function of strike. In this paper we
consider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike,
the local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a
function of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of
strike). We show that for all these new constructions it is still possible to
derive an ordinary differential equation for the option price, which plays a
role of Dupire's equation for the standard local volatility model, and,
moreover, it can be solved in closed form. Finally, similar to CI2018, we show
that given multiple smiles the whole local variance/volatility surface can be
recovered which does not require solving any optimization problem. Instead, it
can be done term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations
for each maturity which is fast.

  Using Two-Tier Bayesian Analysis and Monte Carlo Method","12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Antennas are a key element in any communication system and vector network
analyser (VNA) is popular tool for charactering antenna impedance bandwidth. In
this paper, an efficient uncertainty evaluation method is proposed for VNA
measurement based on its uncertainty propagation mechanism using Bayesian
analysis and Monte Carlo method. The proposed method is generic and can be
applied to VNA with arbitrary number of ports. In order to obtain the complete
information of measurement uncertainty distribution, a two-tier Bayesian
analytic process is carried out. The proposed method contains three steps. In
the first step, the posterior distribution of each uncertainty source of VNA
calibrations is deduced by the use of prior and current sample information
through the first-tier Bayesian analysis. In the second step, the obtained
posterior distributions of uncertainty sources are taken into the Monte Carlo
simulation of one-port VNA measurement uncertainties. In the last step, the
results obtained in the second step are used as the prior distribution of the
secondary Bayesian evaluation, then the evaluation results of the measurement
uncertainty can be obtained with the means, variances and skewness of the
probabilistic distribution. The numerical analysis using an antenna measurement
results demonstrate the high-efficiency and reliability of this proposed
method.

standard model fermions via covariant derivatives. If the local dark matter

dark connection and show how it can be re-interpreted in terms of conventional
dark matter particles. The simplest way to do this is to treat it as a
composite field involving scalars or vectors. The (pseudo-)scalar model
naturally has a perturbative shift-symmetry and leads to versions of the Fuzzy
Dark Matter (FDM) scenario that has recently become popular (eg.,
arXiv:1610.08297) as an alternative to WIMPs. A vector model with a ${\cal

from a source domain so as to infer an accurate model in a target domain where
labels are not available or in scarce at the best. A state-of-the-art approach
for the DA is due to (Ganin et al. 2016), known as DANN, where they attempt to
induce a common representation of source and target domains via adversarial
training. This approach requires a large number of labeled examples from the
source domain to be able to infer a good model for the target domain. However,
in many situations obtaining labels in the source domain is expensive which
results in deteriorated performance of DANN and limits its applicability in
such scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome this
limitation. In our work, we first establish that DANN reduces the original DA
problem into a semi-supervised learning problem over the space of common
representation. Next, we propose a learning approach, namely TransDANN, that
amalgamates adversarial learning and transductive learning to mitigate the
detrimental impact of limited source labels and yields improved performance.
Experimental results (both on text and images) show a significant boost in the
performance of TransDANN over DANN under such scenarios. We also provide
theoretical justification for the performance boost.

such errors can be disastrous and even potentially fatal as shown by the recent
Tesla autopilot crash. Thus, there is an urgent need for formal analysis
systems that can rigorously check neural networks for violations of different
safety properties such as robustness against adversarial perturbations within a
certain $L$-norm of a given image. An effective safety analysis system for a
neural network must be able to either ensure that a safety property is
satisfied by the network or find a counterexample, i.e., an input for which the
network will violate the property. Unfortunately, most existing techniques for
performing such analysis struggle to scale beyond very small networks and the
ones that can scale to larger networks suffer from high false positives and
cannot produce concrete counterexamples in case of a property violation. In
this paper, we present a new efficient approach for rigorously checking
different safety properties of neural networks that significantly outperforms
existing approaches by multiple orders of magnitude. Our approach can check
different safety properties and find concrete counterexamples for networks that
are 10$\times$ larger than the ones supported by existing analysis techniques.
We believe that our approach to estimating tight output bounds of a network for

is longest-lived in the doubly charmed baryon system owing to the destructive
Pauli interference absent in the $\Xi_{cc}^+$ and $\Omega_{cc}^+$. In the
presence of dimension-7 contributions, its lifetime is reduced from
$\sim5.2\times 10^{-13}s$ to $\sim3.0\times 10^{-13}s$. The $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$
baryon has the shortest lifetime of order $0.45\times 10^{-13}s$ due to a large
contribution from the $W$-exchange box diagram. It is difficult to make a
precise quantitative statement on the lifetime of $\Omega_{cc}^+$. Contrary to
$\Xi_{cc}$ baryons, $\tau(\Omega_{cc}^+)$ becomes longer in the presence of
dimension-7 effects and the Pauli interference $\Gamma^{\rm int}_+$ even
becomes negative. This implies that the subleading corrections are too large to
justify the validity of the HQE. Demanding the rate $\Gamma^{\rm int}_+$ to be
positive for a sensible HQE, we conjecture that the $\Omega_c^0$ lifetime lies
in the range of $(0.75\sim 1.80)\times 10^{-13}s$. The lifetime hierarchy
pattern is $\tau(\Xi_{cc}^{++})>\tau(\Omega_{cc}^+)>\tau(\Xi_{cc}^+)$ and the

comparing HHG in laser fields with different ellipticities but constant maximum

is comparable to or even higher than that in the linearly polarized field. To
understand the underlying physics, we develop a reciprocal-space-trajectory
method, which explains HHG in solids by a trajectory ensemble from different
ionization times and different initial states in the reciprocal space. We show
that the cutoff extension is related to an additional pre-acceleration step
prior to ionization, which has been overlooked in solids. By analyzing the
trajectories and the time-frequency spectrogram, we show that the HHG in solids

Instead, the radiation should be described by the electronhole interband
polarization, which leads to the unusual ellipticity dependence. We propose a

of the local extrema for both synthesized scaling processes and turbulent
velocity data from experiments. The results show that for the fractional
Brownian motion (fBm) without intermittency correction the measured extremal
point density (EPD) agrees well with a theoretical prediction. For a
multifractal random walk (MRW) with the lognormal statistics, the measured EPD
is independent with the intermittency parameter $\mu$, suggesting that the
intermittency correction does not change the distribution of extremal points,
but change the amplitude. By introducing a coarse-grained operator, the
power-law behavior of these scaling processes is then revealed via the measured
EPD for different scales. For fBm the scaling exponent $\xi(H)$ is found to be
$\xi(H)=H$, where $H$ is Hurst number, while for MRW $\xi(H)$ shows a linear
relation with the intermittency parameter $\mu$. Such EPD approach is further
applied to the turbulent velocity data obtained from a wind tunnel flow
experiment with the Taylor scale $\lambda$ based Reynolds number $Re_{\lambda}=
720$, and a turbulent boundary layer with the momentum thickness $\theta$ based
Reynolds number $Re_{\theta}= 810$. A scaling exponent $\xi\simeq 0.37$ is
retrieved for the former case. For the latter one, the measured EPD shows
clearly four regimes, which agree well with the four regimes of the turbulent

Shastry-Sutherland lattice with the first $(J_1)$, second $(J_2)$, third
$(J_3)$ fourth $(J_4)$ and fifth $(J_5)$ nearest-neighbour spin couplings are
studied by the classical Monte Carlo method. It is shown that switching on
$J_4$ and $J_5$ interactions (in addition to usually considered $J_1, J_2$ and
$J_3$ interactions) changes significantly the picture of magnetization
processes found for $J_4=J_5=0$ and leads to stabilization of new macroscopic
magnetic phases (plateaus) with fractional magnetization. In particular, it is
found that combined effects of $J_4$ and $J_5$ interactions generate the
following sequence of plateaus with the fractional magnetization: $m/m_s$=1/9,
1/6, 2/9, 1/3, 4/9, 1/2, 5/9 and 2/3. The results obtained are consistent with
experimental measurements of magnetization curves in selected rare-earth

Observations on 55 Cancri e point towards a N-dominated atmosphere. In this
paper we explore this possibility, showing which will be the most abundant
gases and observable species in emission and transmission spectroscopy of such
an atmosphere. We use analytical arguments and observed parameters to estimate
the possible thermal profile of the atmosphere and test three different extreme
possibilities. The chemistry is calculated using equilibrium calculations and
adopting Titan's elemental abundances as a potential N-dominated atmospheric
composition. We also test the effect of different N/O ratios in the atmosphere.
Emission and transmission spectra are computed and showed with a resolution
relevant to future missions suitable to observe super-Earths (e.g. JWST,
ARIEL). We find that even though N$_2$ is the most abundant molecule in the
atmosphere followed by H$_2$ and CO, the transmission spectra shows strong
features of NH3 and HCN, and CO and HCN dominate emission spectra. We also show
that a decrease in the N/O ratio leads to stronger H2O, CO and CO2 and weaker
NH3 and HCN features. A larger N/O is also more consistent with observations.
Our exploration of a N-atmosphere for 55 Cancri e serve as a guide to
understand such atmospheres and provide a reference for future observations.

anatomical models. However, existing methods have been developed using data
mostly from the left ventricle. As a consequence, fiber information obtained
from rule-based methods often does not match histological data in other areas
of the heart such as the right ventricle, having a negative impact in cardiac
simulations beyond the left ventricle. In this work, we present a rule-based
method where fiber orientation is separately modeled in each ventricle
following observations from histology. This allows to create detailed fiber
orientation in specific regions such as the endocardium of the right ventricle,
the interventricular septum and the outflow tracts. We also carried out
electrophysiological simulations involving these structures and with different
fiber configurations. In particular, we built a modelling pipeline for creating
patient-specific volumetric meshes of biventricular geometries, including the
outflow tracts, and subsequently simulate the electrical wavefront propagation
in outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias with different origins for the ectopic
focus. The resulting simulations with the proposed rule-based method showed a
very good agreement with clinical parameters such as the 10 ms isochrone ratio
in a cohort of nine patients suffering from this type of arrhythmia. The
developed modelling pipeline confirms its potential for an in silico
identification of the site of origin in outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias
before clinical intervention.

when implemented correctly, eliminates all memory overhead, and yields
performance that is between 10% to 400% times better than existing high
performance implementations of convolution layers on conventional and embedded
CPU architectures. We also show that a high performance direct convolution
exhibits better scaling performance, i.e. suffers less performance drop, when
increasing the number of threads.

detect and identify divers. The proposed approach enables an autonomous
underwater robot to detect multiple divers in a visual scene and distinguish
between them. Such methods are useful for robots to identify a human leader,
for example, in multi-human/robot teams where only designated individuals are
allowed to command or lean a team of robots. Initial diver identification is
performed using the Faster R-CNN algorithm with a region proposal network which
produces bounding boxes around the divers' locations. Subsequently, a suite of
spatial and frequency domain descriptors are extracted from the bounding boxes
to create a feature vector. A K-Means clustering algorithm, with k set to the
number of detected bounding boxes, thereafter identifies the detected divers
based on these feature vectors. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach on video footage of divers swimming in front of a mobile robot and
demonstrate its accuracy.

demonstrate that this weak form of supervision can drastically reduce the
quantity of human annotated labels and time required for downstream tasks.

  on Modified Mixture Particle Filter","Presented in 2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate and robust tracking of surrounding road participants plays an
important role in autonomous driving. However, there is usually no prior
knowledge of the number of tracking targets due to object emergence, object
disappearance and false alarms. To overcome this challenge, we propose a
generic vehicle tracking framework based on modified mixture particle filter,
which can make the number of tracking targets adaptive to real-time
observations and track all the vehicles within sensor range simultaneously in a
uniform architecture without explicit data association. Each object corresponds
to a mixture component whose distribution is non-parametric and approximated by
particle hypotheses. Most tracking approaches employ vehicle kinematic models
as the prediction model. However, it is hard for these models to make proper
predictions when sensor measurements are lost or become low quality due to
partial or complete occlusions. Moreover, these models are incapable of
forecasting sudden maneuvers. To address these problems, we propose to
incorporate learning-based behavioral models instead of pure vehicle kinematic
models to realize prediction in the prior update of recursive Bayesian state
estimation. Two typical driving scenarios including lane keeping and lane
change are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the
proposed framework as well as the advantages of employing learning-based
models.

imagery. The second problem is approached with a conditional generative
adversarial model that, taking as input the original dynamic image and its
dynamic/static binary mask, is capable of generating the final static image.
The former challenge is addressed by the use of a convolutional network that
learns a multi-class semantic segmentation of the image.
  These generated images can be used for applications such as augmented reality
or vision-based robot localization purposes. To validate our approach, we show
both qualitative and quantitative comparisons against other state-of-the-art

However, manually recognizing and localizing all the cells in pathology slides

pathology image into a spatial map of tumor, stromal and lymphocyte cells. From
this spatial map, we can extracted features that characterize the tumor
micro-environment. Based on these features, we developed an image feature-based
prognostic model and validated the model in two independent cohorts. The
predicted risk group serves as an independent prognostic factor, after
adjusting for clinical variables that include age, gender, smoking status, and
