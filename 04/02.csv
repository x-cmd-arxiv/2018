stable point on the cement floor of an aviary near the west bank of the

dynamical interaction leading to the crime must be reconstructed from
circumstantial data. Our investigation proceeds in two stages. First we take an
audio stream recorded within the aviary near the time of death to identify the
local embedding dimension, thereby enumerating the suspects. Second, we
characterize Mr. Boddy's pre- and post-mortem behavior in the phase space in
terms of an attractor that undergoes an abrupt change in stability. A
supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation can explain this transition. Then we
uniquely identify the murderer. Finally, we note long-term plans to construct
an underlying dynamical model capable of predicting the stability of equilibria
in different parameter regimes, in the event that Mr. Boddy is ever murdered

described in shell model gets ""quenched"" to a universal constant close to 1 can
be explained by nuclear correlations in Fermi-liquid fixed point theory using a
scale-symmetric chiral Lagrangian supplemented with hidden local symmetric
vector mesons. Contrary to what one might naively suspect -- and has been
discussed in some circles, there is no fundamental quenching at nuclear matter
density due to QCD condensates. When the density of many-body systems treated
with the same Lagrangian increases beyond the density $n=n_{1/2}\gsim 2n_0$
(where $n_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density) at which skyrmions
representing baryons fractionize to half-skyrmions, with the $\rho$ meson
driven toward the vector manifestation fixed point and a scalar meson $\sigma$
driven to the dilaton-limit fixed point with the nucleons parity-doubled, the
dense matter supports the ""pseudo-conformal"" sound velocity for $n\gsim
n_{1/2}$ while the trace of the energy momentum tensor remains non-vanishing. A
plausible interpretation is that this signals the emergence of scale symmetry
not explicitly present or hidden in QCD in the vacuum. The fundamental constant
$g_A$, unaffected by QCD condensates for $n< n_{1/2}$, does go to 1 as the
dilaton-limit fixed point is approached before arriving at chiral restoration,
but it is not directly related to the ""quenched $g_A$"" in nuclei which can be
explained as a Fermi-liquid fixed point quantity. The mechanism that produces a
precocious pseudo-conformal sound velocity is expected to impact on the tidal
deformability $\Lambda$ in gravity waves from coalescing neutron stars.

spacecraft orbiting Mars. Previous estimations of the non-thermal electron
energy based on the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) data were incomplete since RHESSI missed the peak of the flare
impulsive phase. In contrast, HEND observed the whole flare. We used two models
to estimate the energy of the non-thermal electrons: the cold thick target
model and the warm thick target model. We found that, depending on the model
used and the low-energy cutoff ($E_\mathrm{c}$) of the non-thermal electrons,
the estimate of their total energy in the entire flare can vary from $2.3
\times 10^{32}$ to $6.2 \times 10^{33}$ ergs. The lowest estimate, $2.3 \times
10^{32}$ ergs, obtained within the cold thick target model and fixed
$E_\mathrm{c}=43$ keV, is consistent with the previous estimate. In this case,
non-thermal electrons accelerated in the peak of the flare impulsive phase
missed by RHESSI contained approximately $40\%$ of the total energy of
non-thermal electrons of the entire flare. The highest value, $6.2 \times
10^{33}$ ergs, obtained with the cold thick target model and fixed
$E_\mathrm{c}=10$ keV, looks abnormally high, since it exceeds the total
non-potential magnetic energy of the parent active region and the total
bolometric energy radiated in the flare. Our estimates also show that the total

few orders of magnitude higher than of the population of energetic electrons

frame that is adapted to difference equations by prolongation conditions.
  For any Lagrangian that is invariant under a Lie group action on the space of
dependent variables, we show that the Euler--Lagrange equations can be
calculated directly in terms of the invariants of the group action.
Furthermore, Noether's conservation laws can be written in terms of a
difference moving frame and the invariants. We show that this form of the laws
can significantly ease the problem of solving the Euler--Lagrange equations,
and we also show how to use a difference frame to integrate Lie group invariant
difference equations. In this Part I, we illustrate the theory by applications
to Lagrangians invariant under various solvable Lie groups. The theory is also
generalized to deal with variational symmetries that do not leave the
Lagrangian invariant.
  Apart from the study of systems that are inherently discrete, one significant
application is to obtain geometric (variational) integrators that have finite
difference approximations of the continuous conservation laws embedded
\textit{a priori}. This is achieved by taking an invariant finite difference
Lagrangian in which the discrete invariants have the correct continuum limit to
their smooth counterparts. We show the calculations for a discretization of the
Lagrangian for Euler's elastica, and compare our discrete solution to that of
its smooth continuum limit.

developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than
average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been
attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and
therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate
influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to
accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United
States of America's primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet)
monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to
lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate
internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance
systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak
detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical
framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the
adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google
Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels.
We find that zip codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical
blind-spot for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to
ameliorate.

that any symmetric monotone function $f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\}$ exhibits a sharp
threshold phenomenon. This means that the expectation of $f$ with respect to
the biased measure $\mu_{p}$ increases rapidly from 0 to 1 as $p$ increases.
  In this paper we present `robust' versions of the theorem, which assert that
it holds also if the function is `almost' monotone, and admits a much weaker
notion of symmetry. Unlike the original proof of the theorem which relies on
hypercontractivity, our proof relies on a `regularity' lemma (of the class of
Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma and its generalizations) and on the `invariance
principle' of Mossel, O'Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz which allows (under certain
conditions) replacing functions on the cube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ with functions on
Gaussian random variables.
  The hypergraph removal lemma of Gowers (2007) and independently of Nagle,
R\""odl, Schacht, and Skokan (2006) says that if a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$
vertices contains few copies of a fixed hypergraph $H$, then it can be made
$H$-free by removing few of its edges. While this settles the `hypergraph
removal problem' in the case where $k$ and $H$ are fixed, the result is
meaningless when $k$ is large (e.g. $k>\log\log\log n$).
  Using our robust version of the Friedgut-Kalai Theorem, we obtain a
hypergraph removal lemma that holds for $k$ up to linear in $n$ for a large
class of hypergraphs. These contain all the hypergraphs such that both their
number of edges and the sizes of the intersections of pairs of their edges are
upper bounded by some constant.

therefore introduce a consensus-based mechanism that is often able to recover

response, our results show an enhancement of the thermopower and the figure of
merit of the system. For a nonlinear situation, we calculate the thermoelectric
efficiency and power output, concluding that the T-shaped double quantum dot is
an efficient thermoelectric device. Moreover, we demonstrate the great
importance of the DOS Van-Hove singularity at the neighborhood of the Fermi
energy to obtain a very significant increase of the thermoelectric efficiency
of the system.

observing campaign on the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS~13224$-$3809, taken
simultaneously with 500\,ks of NuSTAR data. The X-ray lightcurve shows three
flux peaks, registering at about 100 times the minimum flux seen during the
campaign, and rapid variability with a time scale of kiloseconds. The spectra
are well fit with a primary powerlaw continuum, two relativistic-blurred
reflection components from the inner accretion disk with very high iron
abundance, and a simple blackbody-shaped model for the remaining soft excess.
The spectral variability is dominated by the power law continuum from a corona
region within a few gravitational radii from the black hole. Additionally,
blueshifted Ne \textsc{x}, Mg \textsc{xii}, Si \textsc{xiv} and S \textsc{xvi}
absorption lines are identified in the stacked low-flux spectrum, confirming
the presence of a highly ionized outflow with velocity up to $v= 0.267$ and
$0.225$\,c. We fit the absorption features with \texttt{xstar} models and find
a relatively constant velocity outflow through the whole observation. Finally,
we replace the \texttt{bbody} and supersolar abundance reflection models by
fitting the soft excess successfully with the extended reflection model
\texttt{relxillD}, which allows for higher densities than the standard
\texttt{relxill} model. This returns a disk electron density $n_{\rm
e}>10^{18.7}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and lowers the iron abundance from $Z_{\rm
Fe}=24^{+3}_{-4}Z_\odot$ with $n_{\rm e}\equiv10^{15}$\,cm$^{-3}$ to $Z_{\rm

over a ""timing"" channel, namely a channel where information is communicated
through the timestamps of the transmitted symbols. Each symbol transmitted from
a sensor to a controller in a closed-loop system is received subject to some to
random delay. The sensor can encode messages in the waiting times between
successive transmissions and the controller must decode them from the
inter-reception times of successive symbols. This set-up is analogous to a
telephone system where a transmitter signals a phone call to a receiver through
a ""ring"" and, after the random delay required to establish the connection; the
receiver is aware of the ""ring"" being received. Since there is no data payload
exchange between the sensor and the controller, this set-up provides an
abstraction for performing event-triggering control with zero-payload rate. We
show the following requirement for stabilization: for the state of the system
to converge to zero in probability, the timing capacity of the channel should
be, essentially, at least as large as the entropy rate of the system.
Conversely, in the case the symbol delays are exponentially distributed, we
show an ""almost"" tight sufficient condition using a coding strategy that
refines the estimate of the decoded message every time a new symbol is
received. Our results generalize previous zero-payload event-triggering control
strategies, revealing a fundamental limit in using timing information for
stabilization, independent of any transmission strategy.

for scalable Bayesian inference on a broad class of multivariate discrete data

multiplication of component posteriors that can be independently sampled from.
Analogous to composite likelihood methods, these component posteriors are based
on univariate or bivariate marginal densities. Utilizing the fact that the
score functions of these densities are unbiased, we show that Bayesian mosaic
is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. Since the
evaluation of univariate or bivariate marginal densities can rely on numerical
integration, sampling from Bayesian mosaic bypasses the traditional data
augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC) method, which has a provably slow
mixing rate when data are imbalanced. Moreover, we show that sampling from

we advocate for the use of a backtracking model that predicts the preceding

predicts and sample for which the (state, action)-tuples may have led to that

these traces to improve a policy. We provide a variational interpretation for
this idea and a practical algorithm in which the backtracking model samples

timings were obtained from the 2.15-m JS telescope at CASLEO, San Juan,

a W-type shallow contact binary with a fill-out factor $f \sim 11\%$ and high
mass ratio $q \sim 1.587$ (1/q = 0.63), where the hotter component is the less
massive one ($M_1 \sim 0.52M_{\odot}$ and $M_2 \sim 0.82M_{\odot}$). For
orbital period investigation, the new fifteen eclipse times and those in
previous published were compiled. Based on $O-C$ analysis with very weak
evidence suggests that a long-term period decrease with a rate of
$\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = -9.61\times10^{-9}$ d $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ is
superimposed on a cyclic variation ($A_3$ = 0.0054 days and $P_3$ = 49.9 yrs).
The long-term period decrease can be interpreted as mass transfer from the more
massive component to the less massive one or combine with the angular momentum
loss (AML) via magnetic braking. In addition, with the marginal contact phase,
high mass ratio (1/q $>$ 0.4) and the long-term period decrease, all suggest
that RW Dor is a newly formed contact binary via a Case A mass transfer and it
will evolve into a deeper normal contact binary. If the cyclic change is
correct, the light-travel time effect via the presence of a cool third body
will be more plausible to explain for this.

remains a challenging task to apply segmentation techniques to video-based
applications. Specifically, the high throughput of video streams, the sheer
cost of running fully convolutional networks, together with the low-latency
requirements in many real-world applications, e.g. autonomous driving, present
a significant challenge to the design of the video segmentation framework. To
tackle this combined challenge, we develop a framework for video semantic
segmentation, which incorporates two novel components: (1) a feature
propagation module that adaptively fuses features over time via spatially
variant convolution, thus reducing the cost of per-frame computation; and (2)
an adaptive scheduler that dynamically allocate computation based on accuracy
prediction. Both components work together to ensure low latency while
maintaining high segmentation quality. On both Cityscapes and CamVid, the
proposed framework obtained competitive performance compared to the state of
the art, while substantially reducing the latency, from 360 ms to 119 ms.

the vulnerabilities of cyber-physical components that support their operation.
In this article, we investigate how the infrastructure operator (defender)
should prioritize the investment in securing a set of facilities in order to
reduce the impact of a strategic adversary (attacker) who can target a facility
to increase the overall usage cost of the system. We adopt a game-theoretic
approach to model the defender-attacker interaction and study two models:
normal-form game -- where both players move simultaneously; and sequential game
-- where attacker moves after observing the defender's strategy. For each
model, we provide a complete characterization of how the set of facilities that
are secured by the defender in equilibrium vary with the costs of attack and
defense. Importantly, our analysis provides a sharp condition relating the cost
parameters for which the defender has the first mover advantage. Specifically,
we show that to fully deter the attacker from targeting any facility, the
defender needs to proactively secure all ""vulnerable facilities"" at an
appropriate level of effort. We illustrate the outcome of the attacker-defender
interaction on a simple transportation network. We also suggest a dynamic
learning setup to understand how this outcome can affect the ability of
imperfectly informed users to make their decisions about using the system in
the post-attack stage.

  First, we follow a recent thread of research for $n$-sided dice with pairwise
ordering induced by the probability, relative to $1/2$, that a throw from one
die is higher than the other. We build on a recent result of Polymath showing
that three dice with i.i.d. faces drawn from the uniform distribution on
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and conditioned on the average of faces equal to $(n+1)/2$ are
intransitive with asymptotic probability $1/4$. We show that if dice faces are
drawn from a non-uniform continuous mean zero distribution conditioned on the
average of faces equal to $0$, then three dice are transitive with high
probability. We also extend our results to stationary Gaussian dice, whose
faces, for example, can be the fractional Brownian increments with Hurst index
$H\in(0,1)$.
  Second, we pose an analogous model in the context of Condorcet voting. We
consider $n$ voters who rank $k$ alternatives independently and uniformly at
random. The winner between each two alternatives is decided by a majority vote
based on the preferences. We show that in this model, if all pairwise elections
are close to tied, then the asymptotic probability of obtaining any tournament
on the $k$ alternatives is equal to $2^{-k(k-1)/2}$, which markedly differs
from known results in the model without conditioning. We also explore the
Condorcet voting model where methods other than simple majority are used for
pairwise elections. We investigate some natural definitions of ""close to tied""
for general functions and exhibit an example where the distribution over
tournaments is not uniform under those definitions.

we take a principled approach to apply sharding, which is a well-studied and
proven technique to scale out databases, to blockchain systems in order to
improve their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however,
due to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and
blockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine
consensus protocols, by doing so we improve individual shards' throughput.
Next, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that leverages a trusted
random beacon to securely assign nodes into shards. We rely on trusted
hardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and
shard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction
protocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators
are malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both
on a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our
consensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions
at scale. More importantly, our sharded blockchain reaches a high throughput
that can handle Visa-level workloads, and is the largest ever reported in a

components from samples of X=AS where A is an unknown mixing matrix.
Critically, all existing methods for ICA rely on and exploit strongly the
assumption that S is not Gaussian as otherwise A becomes unidentifiable. In
this paper, we show that in fact one can handle the case of Gaussian components
by imposing structure on the matrix A. Specifically, we assume that A is sparse
and generic in the sense that it is generated from a sparse Bernoulli-Gaussian
ensemble. Under this condition, we give an efficient algorithm to recover the
columns of A given only the covariance matrix of X as input even when S has
several Gaussian components.

squared ($R^2$) term and the standard Higgs field non-minimally coupled to
gravity in addition to the Einstein $R$ term. Detailed analysis of the power
spectrum of this model with mass hierarchy is presented, and we find that one
can describe this model as an effective single-field model in the slow-roll
regime with a modified sound speed. The scalar spectral index predicted by this
model coincides with those given by the $R^2$ inflation and the Higgs inflation
implying that there is a close relation between this model and the $R^2$
inflation already in the original (Jordan) frame. For a typical value of the
self-coupling of the standard Higgs field at the high energy scale of
inflation, the role of the Higgs field in parameter space involved is to modify
the scalaron mass, so that the original mass parameter in the $R^2$ inflation
can deviate from its standard value when non-minimal coupling between the Ricci
scalar and the Higgs field is large enough.

cross-domain generation, but it faces difficulty in cross-modal generation due
to the lack of a common distribution between heterogeneous data. Most existing
methods of conditional based cross-modal GANs adopt the strategy of
one-directional transfer and have achieved preliminary success on text-to-image
transfer. Instead of learning the transfer between different modalities, we aim
to learn a synchronous latent space representing the cross-modal common
concept. A novel network component named synchronizer is proposed in this work
to judge whether the paired data is synchronous/corresponding or not, which can
constrain the latent space of generators in the GANs. Our GAN model, named as
SyncGAN, can successfully generate synchronous data (e.g., a pair of image and
sound) from identical random noise. For transforming data from one modality to
another, we recover the latent code by inverting the mappings of a generator
and use it to generate data of different modality. In addition, the proposed
model can achieve semi-supervised learning, which makes our model more flexible
for practical applications.

specific optical flow solver, the TV-L1 method, and is initialized by unfolding
its optimization iterations as neural layers. TVNet can therefore be used
directly without any extra learning. Moreover, it can be naturally concatenated
with other task-specific networks to formulate an end-to-end architecture, thus
making our method more efficient than current multi-stage approaches by
avoiding the need to pre-compute and store features on disk. Finally, the
parameters of the TVNet can be further fine-tuned by end-to-end training. This
enables TVNet to learn richer and task-specific patterns beyond exact optical
flow. Extensive experiments on two action recognition benchmarks verify the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our TVNet achieves better accuracies
than all compared methods, while being competitive with the fastest counterpart
in terms of features extraction time.

this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of multi-user scheduling performance to
channel misreporting in systems with massive antennas. The main result is that
for the round-robin scheduler combined with max-min power control, the channel
magnitude misreporting is harmful to the scheduling performance and has a
different impact from the purely physical layer analysis. Specifically, for the
homogeneous users that have equal average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs),
underreporting is harmful, while overreporting is beneficial to others. In
underreporting, the asymptotic rate loss on others is derived, which is tight
when the number of antennas is huge. One interesting observation in our
research is that the rate loss ""periodically"" increases and decreases as the
number of misreporters grows. For the heterogeneous users that have various
SNRs, both underreporting and overreporting can degrade the scheduler
performance. We observe that strong misreporting changes the user grouping
decision and hence greatly decreases some users' rates regardless of others
gaining rate improvements, while with carefully designed weak misreporting, the
scheduling decision keeps fixed and the rate loss on others is shown to grow
nearly linearly with the number of misreporters.

(CS) and parallel imaging is a powerful method to reduce MR imaging scan time.
However, many reconstruction algorithms have high computational costs. To
address this, we investigate deep residual learning networks to remove aliasing
artifacts from artifact corrupted images. The proposed deep residual learning
networks are composed of magnitude and phase networks that are separately
trained. If both phase and magnitude information are available, the proposed
algorithm can work as an iterative k-space interpolation algorithm using
framelet representation. When only magnitude data is available, the proposed
approach works as an image domain post-processing algorithm. Even with strong
coherent aliasing artifacts, the proposed network successfully learned and
removed the aliasing artifacts, whereas current parallel and CS reconstruction
methods were unable to remove these artifacts. Comparisons using single and
multiple coil show that the proposed residual network provides good
reconstruction results with orders of magnitude faster computational time than
existing compressed sensing methods. The proposed deep learning framework may
have a great potential for accelerated MR reconstruction by generating accurate
results immediately.

However, existing CNN based algorithms suffer from the problem that the

common that traffic images and videos contain vehicles with a large variance of
scales. In this paper, we delve into the source of scale sensitivity, and
reveal two key issues: 1) existing RoI pooling destroys the structure of small
scale objects, 2) the large intra-class distance for a large variance of scales
exceeds the representation capability of a single network. Based on these
findings, we present a scale-insensitive convolutional neural network (SINet)

a context-aware RoI pooling to maintain the contextual information and original

network to minimize the intra-class distance of features. These lightweight
techniques bring zero extra time complexity but prominent detection accuracy
improvement. The proposed techniques can be equipped with any deep network

to highlight the deep analogy existing between the problem of spectra in ionic

with the equipartition problem, a first positive indication is given on the
modifications that should be introduced in a classical statistical treatment:
the new results at low temperatures show that it is indeed the Clausius

if the temperature is taken as proportional to mean kinetic energy, but
agreement is recovered through the only expedient of introducing a suitable

presence of a significant ferromagnetic coupling, the so-called direct
exchange, which fully compensates ubiquitous antiferromagnetic interactions of
the superexchange origin. Having a nonlocal nature, the direct exchange was
previously ignored because it cannot be captured within the conventional
density functional methods and significantly challenges ground state models
earlier proposed for Sn/SiC(0001). Furthermore, heavy adatoms induce strong
spin-orbit coupling, which leads to a highly anisotropic form of the spin

  Phone Numbers Across Online Social Networks","To appear in WebScience 2018",,,,"cs.CY cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cybercriminals abuse Online Social Networks (OSNs) to lure victims into a
variety of spam. Among different spam types, a less explored area is OSN abuse
that leverages the telephony channel to defraud users. Phone numbers are
advertized via OSNs, and users are tricked into calling these numbers. To
expand the reach of such scam / spam campaigns, phone numbers are advertised
across multiple platforms like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, Flickr, and
YouTube. In this paper, we present the first data-driven characterization of
cross-platform campaigns that use multiple OSN platforms to reach their victims
and use phone numbers for monetization.
  We collect 23M posts containing 1.8M unique phone numbers from Twitter,
Facebook, GooglePlus, Youtube, and Flickr over a period of six months.
Clustering these posts helps us identify 202 campaigns operating across the
globe with Indonesia, United States, India, and United Arab Emirates being the
most prominent originators. We find that even though Indonesian campaigns
generate highest volume (3.2M posts), only 1.6% of the accounts propagating
Indonesian campaigns have been suspended so far. By examining campaigns running
across multiple OSNs, we discover that Twitter detects and suspends 93% more
accounts than Facebook. Therefore, sharing intelligence about abuse-related
user accounts across OSNs can aid in spam detection. According to our dataset,
around 35K victims and 8.8M USD could have been saved if intelligence was
shared across the OSNs. By analyzing phone number based spam campaigns running
on OSNs, we highlight the unexplored variety of phone-based attacks surfacing
on OSNs.

moment of inertia of the pulsar affecting its rotation. This will affect the
extremely accurately measured spin rate of the pulsar as well as its pulse
profile (due to induced wobbling depending on the source direction). The effect
will be most pronounced at resonance and should be detectable by accurate
observations of the pulsar signal. The pulsar, in this sense, acts as a
remotely stationed Weber detector of gravitational waves whose signal can be
monitored on earth. With possible gravitational wave sources spread around in
the universe, pulsars in their neighborhoods can provide us a family of
\textit{remote} detectors all of which can be monitored on earth. Even if GW
are detected directly by earth based conventional detectors, such pulsar
detectors can provide additional information for accurate determination of the
source location. This can be of crucial importance for sources which do not
emit any other form of radiation such as black hole mergers. For the
gravitational wave events already detected by LIGO (and Virgo), our proposal
suggests that one should look for specific pulsars which would have been
disturbed by these events, and will transmit this disturbance via their pulse
signals in any foreseeable future. If these future pulsar events can be
predicted with accuracy then a focused effort can be made to detect any
possible changes in the signals of those specific pulsars.

Our results shows that it is possible to have a $6 \sigma$ detection of the

each in $N_p = 25$ independent fields-of-view. However, not much can be done
beyond this using the cross-correlation signal for $z_c = 3.35$ and $B = 30 \,
{\rm MHz}$. Apart from this, we have also envisaged a situation where
observations are carried out at $z_c = 3.05$ and $2.55$ which lie closer to the
peak of the quasar distribution at $z = 2.25$ and with a larger bandwidth of $B
= 60 \, {\rm MHz}$. We see that the SNR of the cross-correlation detection can
be significantly enhanced to $\sim 17$ for $z_c = 2.55$ and $B = 60 \, {\rm

an ${\rm SNR} \ge 5$ by combining the cross-correlation with the HI 21-cm
auto-correlation measurements. We further find that a measurement of the binned

difference between tuning of the amplitude or the phase of the driving term

leads to quasiperiodic route to chaos. While tuning of the frequency with a
fixed (large) amplitude leads to a crisis induced intermittency route to a
chaotic dynamics, where the system intermittently visits different attractors
in the phase space. Surprisingly, a chirp frequency superposed on a harmonic
signal suppresses the chaotic motion, thereby yielding an orderly dynamics,

fluctuation-electromagnetic effects are strongly enhanced even in the presence
of dissipation in the system. The resonance takes place at the particle-surface
separation
  $ d <d_0= R[3/4\varepsilon_1''(\omega_1)\varepsilon_2''(\omega_2)]^{1/3}$

function of a particle or a medium at the surface plasmon or phonon polariton

poles in the photon generation rate at $\Omega\approx \omega_1 + \omega_2$.
These poles arise due to the multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves
between the particle and the surface under the conditions of the anomalous
Doppler effect and they exist even in the presence of dissipation. For $ d
<d_0$ in the dependence on the particle rotation frequency the Casimir force
can change sign, i.e. the attraction of the particle to the surface is replaced

to a QNSR. This happens independently of the characteristics of the 1-loop
effective potential $V_{1-loop}$, which can be initially positive, negative or
vanishing, and maximal, minimal or at a saddle point. In all cases, the
classical no-scale structure is restored at the quantum level, during the

The specific activity is measured to be $(38.1\pm 2.2~\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm

a number of potential buyers, whose values are drawn from known independent and
regular (not necessarily identical) distributions. There are four widely-used
and widely-studied mechanisms in the literature: {\sf Myerson Auction}~({\sf
OPT}), {\sf Sequential Posted-Pricing}~({\sf SPM}), {\sf Second-Price Auction
with Anonymous Reserve}~({\sf AR}), and {\sf Anonymous Pricing}~({\sf AP}).
  {\sf OPT} is revenue-optimal but complicated, which also experiences several
issues in practice such as fairness; {\sf AP} is the simplest mechanism, but
also generates the lowest revenue among these four mechanisms; {\sf SPM} and
{\sf AR} are of intermediate complexity and revenue. We explore revenue gaps
among these mechanisms, each of which is defined as the largest ratio between
revenues from a pair of mechanisms. We establish two tight bounds and one
improved bound:
  1. {\sf SPM} vs.\ {\sf AP}: this ratio studies the power of discrimination in
pricing schemes. We obtain the tight ratio of $\mathcal{C^*} \approx 2.62$,
closing the gap between $\big[\frac{e}{e - 1}, e\big]$ left before.
  2. {\sf AR} vs.\ {\sf AP}: this ratio measures the relative power of auction
scheme vs.\ pricing scheme, when no discrimination is allowed. We attain the
tight ratio of $\frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.64$, closing the previously known
bounds $\big[\frac{e}{e - 1}, e\big]$.
  3. {\sf OPT} vs.\ {\sf AR}: this ratio quantifies the power of discrimination

e\big]$. The lower-bound of $2$ was conjectured to be tight by Hartline and

detection of public opinion among Twitter users. Given the fact that Twitter
messages are generated constantly with dizzying rates, a huge volume of
streaming data is created, thus there is an imperative need for accurate
methods for knowledge discovery and mining of this information. Although there
exists a plethora of twitter sentiment analysis methods in the recent
literature, the researchers have shifted to real-time sentiment identification
on twitter streaming data, as expected. A major challenge is to deal with the
Big Data challenges arising in Twitter streaming applications concerning both
Volume and Velocity. Under this perspective, in this paper, a methodological
approach based on open source tools is provided for real-time detection of
changes in sentiment that is ultra efficient with respect to both memory
consumption and computational cost. This is achieved by iteratively collecting
tweets in real time and discarding them immediately after their process. For
this purpose, we employ the Lexicon approach for sentiment characterizations,
while change detection is achieved through appropriate control charts that do
not require historical information. We believe that the proposed methodology
provides the trigger for a potential large-scale monitoring of threads in an
attempt to discover fake news spread or propaganda efforts in their early
stages. Our experimental real-time analysis based on a recent hashtag provides
evidence that the proposed approach can detect meaningful sentiment changes

attacks such as alteration of control flow, data leaks or memory corruption.
Many existing secure compilers are proven to be fully abstract, meaning that
they reflect and preserve observational equivalence. Fully abstract compilation
is a strong and useful property that, in certain cases, comes at the cost of
requiring expensive runtime constructs in compiled code. These constructs may
have no relevance for security, but are needed to accommodate differences
between the source language and the target language that fully abstract
compilation necessarily regards. As an alternative to fully abstract
compilation, this paper explores a different criterion for secure compilation
called robustly safe compilation or RSC. Briefly, this criterion means that the
compiled code preserves relevant safety properties of the source program
against all adversarial contexts interacting with said program. We show that
RSC can be attained easily and results in code that is more efficient than that
generated by fully abstract compilers. We also develop three illustrative
robustly-safe compilers and, through them, develop two different proof
techniques for establishing that a compiler attains RSC. Through these, we also
establish that proving RSC is simpler than proving fully abstraction.

channel) is represented as a network vertex. The network dynamic evolution is
accessed using a set of modeling parameters (radii and thresholds), and new
characterization techniques are introduced to capt information regarding within
and between color channel spatial interaction. An automatic and adaptive
approach for threshold selection is also proposed. We conduct classification
experiments on 5 well-known datasets: Vistex, Usptex, Outex13, CURet and MBT.
Results among various literature methods are compared, including deep

  in Planetary and Space Science",,"10.1016/j.pss.2018.03.009",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asteroid families are formed as the result of collisions. Large fragments are
ejected with speeds of the order of the escape velocity from the parent body.
After the family formation, the fragments' orbits evolve in the space of proper
elements because of gravitational and non-gravitational perturbations, such as
the Yarkovsky effect. Disentangling the contribution to the current orbital
position of family members caused by the initial ejection velocity field and
the subsequent orbital evolution is usually a difficult task. Among the more
than 100 asteroid families currently known, some interact with secular
resonances. Linear secular resonances occur when there is a commensurability
between the precession frequency of the longitude of the pericenter (g) or of
the longitude of node (s) of an asteroid and a planet, or a massive asteroid.
The linear secular resonance most effective in increasing an asteroid
eccentricity is the ${\nu}_6$, that corresponds to a commensurability between
the precession frequency g of an asteroid and Saturn's $g_6$. Non-linear
secular resonances involve commensurabilities of higher order, and can often be
expressed as combinations of linear secular resonances. This is the case, for
instance, of the $z_k=k(g-g_6)+(s-s_6)$ resonances. Asteroid families that are
crossed by secular resonances are of particular interest in dynamical
astronomy. First, they often provide a clear evidence of asteroid orbit
evolution due to the Yarkovsky effect. Second, conserved quantities of secular
dynamics can be used to set valuable constraints on the magnitude of the
original ejection velocity field. Finally, by changing the value of inclination
of family members nodal secular resonances with massive asteroids or dwarf
planets can cause the i distribution to become more and more leptokurtic (i.e.,
more peaked and with larger tails than that of a Gaussian distribution).

with randomly perturbed boundary. The target is located between a partially
coherent source which transmits the wave, and a detector which measures the
spatially integrated energy flux of the wave. The imaging is impeded by random
boundary scattering effects that accumulate as the wave propagates. We consider
a very large distance (range) between the target and the detector, where that
cumulative scattering is so strong that it distributes the energy evenly among
the components (modes) of the wave. Conventional imaging is impossible in this
equipartition regime. Nevertheless, we show that the target can be located with
a ghost imaging modality. This forms an image using the cross-correlation of
the measured energy flux, integrated over the aperture of the detector, with
the time and space resolved energy flux in a reference waveguide, at the search
range. We consider two reference waveguides: The waveguide with unperturbed
boundary, in which we can calculate the energy flux, and the actual random
waveguide, before the presence of the target, in which the energy flux should
be measured. We analyze the ghost imaging modality from first principles and
show that it can be efficient in a random waveguide geometry in which there is
both strong modal dispersion and mode coupling induced by scattering, provided
that the standard ghost imaging function is modified and integrated over a
suitable time offset window in order to compensate for dispersion and
diffusion. The analysis quantifies the resolution of the image in terms of the
source and detector aperture, the range offset between the source and the
target, and the duration of the measurements.

influence of stochastic perturbations. We consider transient escapes from a
marginally stable ""quiescent"" equilibrium to a more stable ""active""
equilibrium. The presence of coupling introduces dependence between the escape
processes: for diffusive coupling there is a strongly coupled limit (fast
domino regime) where the escapes are strongly synchronised while for
intermediate coupling (slow domino regime) without partially escaped stable
states, there is still a delayed effect. These regimes can be associated with
bifurcations of equilibria in the low-noise limit. In this paper we consider a
localized form of non-diffusive (i.e pulse-like) coupling and find similar
changes in the distribution of escape times with coupling strength. However we
find transition to a slow domino regime that is not associated with any
bifurcations of equilibria. We show that this transition can be understood as a
codimension-one saddle connection bifurcation for the low-noise limit. At
transition, the most likely escape path from one attractor hits the escape
saddle from the basin of another partially escaped attractor. After this
bifurcation we find increasing coefficient of variation of the subsequent
escape times.

supernovae--and referring to the relatively ""local"" part of the Universe--are
about 10% greater than the ones following from the analysis of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation, which refers to the ""global"" scales. The
most popular interpretation of this discord, widely discussed nowadays, is
variation of the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w. However, there
might be a much simpler explanation, following from the recent observations of
the rotation curves in the high-redshift galaxies. Namely, it was found that
they have much smaller dark-matter halos than galaxies in the vicinity of us
[Genzel, et al. Nature 543 (2017), 397]. Since both the dark and luminous
matter possess the same dust-like equation of state and, therefore, their
average cosmological densities evolve by the same way, our local neighborhood
is not quite typical but rather overfilled with the dark matter. Then, the
local value of the Hubble constant should be greater than the global one.
Roughly speaking, a twofold excess of the dark matter in our local Universe
would give just the above-mentioned 10% increase in the value of Hubble
parameter.

protoplanets from the Asteroid Belt and the terrestrial planet region of the
Solar System requires a reliable modeling of their internal thermal evolution.
An important ingredient for this is a detailed knowledge of the heat
conductivity of the chondritic mixture of minerals and metal in planetesimals.
The temperature dependence of the heat conductivity is evaluated here from the
properties of its mixture components by a theoretical model. This allows to
predict the temperature dependent heat conductivity for the full range of
observed meteoritic compositions and also for possible other compositions. For
this purpose, published results on the temperature dependence of heat
conductivity of the mineral components found in chondritic material are fitted
to the model of Callaway for heat conductivity in solids by phonons. For the
Ni,Fe-alloy published laboratory data are used. The heat conductivity of
chondritic material then is calculated by means of mixing-rules. The role of
micro-cracks is studied which increase the importance of wall-scattering for
phonon-based heat conductivity. The model is applied to published data on heat
conductivity of individual chondrites. The experimental data for the dependence
of the heat conductivity on temperature can be reproduced rather well by the
model if the heat conductivity is calculated for the composition of the
meteorites. It is found that micro-cracks have a significant impact on the
temperature dependence of the heat conductivity because of their reduction of
phonon scattering length.

temperature of 1090 K. The condensation temperature indicates that the
condensate was amorphous carbon. There was a gradual decrease of the grain size
and dust mass during the recovery phase. Absolute parameter values given here
are for an assumed distance of 1.2 kpc. We conclude that the maximum mass of
dust produced was 1.2 x 10-7 solar masses if the dust was amorphous carbon. The
average grain radius grew to a maximum of 2.9 microns at a temperature of 720 K

due to the hot white dwarf peaked around day 220, when its spectrum was that of

that the X-ray fluence was sufficient to destroy the dust. Our data show that
the post-dust event X-ray brightening is not due to dust destruction, which
certainly occurred, as the dust is optically thin to X-rays.

networks by designing a VLP system configuration that involves multiple LED
transmitters with known locations (e.g., on the ceiling) and visible light
communication (VLC) units equipped with both LEDs and photodetectors (PDs) for
the purpose of cooperation. First, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the localization of VLC
units in the proposed cooperative scenario. To tackle the nonconvex structure
of the MLE, we adopt a set-theoretic approach by formulating the problem of
cooperative localization as a quasiconvex feasibility problem, where the aim is
to find a point inside the intersection of convex constraint sets constructed
as the sublevel sets of quasiconvex functions resulting from the Lambertian
formula. Next, we devise two feasibility-seeking algorithms based on iterative
gradient projections to solve the feasibility problem. Both algorithms are
amenable to distributed implementation, thereby avoiding high-complexity
centralized approaches. Capitalizing on the concept of quasi-Fej\'er convergent
sequences, we carry out a formal convergence analysis to prove that the
proposed algorithms converge to a solution of the feasibility problem in the
consistent case. Numerical examples illustrate the improvements in localization
performance achieved via cooperation among VLC units and evidence the
convergence of the proposed algorithms to true VLC unit locations in both the
consistent and inconsistent cases.

discs, while these are relatively massive. We study how Jupiter-mass
planet-seeds (termed protoplanets) evolve in massive, but gravitationally
stable (Q>1.5), discs using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find that
the protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in
the disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer
timescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the
protoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high
fraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the
protoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is
critical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of
the protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not
be captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet
initially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity
could be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet
easily observable (albeit only for a short time). Due to the high gas accretion
rate, the protoplanet generally grows above the deuterium-burning mass-limit.
Protoplanet radiative feedback reduces its mass growth so that its final mass
is near the brown dwarf-planet boundary. The fate of a young planet-seed is
diverse and could vary from a gas giant planet on a circular orbit at a few AU
from the central star to a brown dwarf on an eccentric, wide orbit.

the volunteer efforts of collaboration scientists. We summarize the strategy
and implementation of eight EPO initiatives. For content distributed via social

EPO online products reached ~2,500 users per post, and 94% of these users
indicate a predisposition to science-related interests. We find no obvious
correlation between post type and post reach, with the most popular posts
featuring the intersections of science and art and/or popular culture. We
conclude that one key issue of the online DES EPO program was designing
material which would inspire new interest in science. The greatest difficulty
of the online DES EPO program was sustaining scientist participation and
collaboration support; the most successful programs are those which capitalized
on the hobbies of participating scientists. We present statistics and

potentially instructive resource for scientists or EPO professionals interested

Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) photon detector for positron emission tomography
(PET). The detectors used comprise 40 mm x 40 mm x 5 mm monolithic CZT crystals
that employ a cross-strip electrode pattern with interspersed steering
electrodes to obtain high spatial and energy resolution. The specific
positioning degeneracy studied results when a photon event interacts in two
detector pixels, triggering two anode and two cathode strips, hence presenting
four pixels as potential interaction locations. An experiment was performed
where a 1 mm diameter collimated pencil beam of annihilation photons was used
to target a detector pixel of known location. The data acquired provided an
empirical basis to train and test the algorithm. The study shows that,
depending on the restrictions applied on the data set, the proposed algorithm
accurately identifies the true photon interaction locations 59.7% to 66.7% of
the time, which is 19.4% to 33.4% better than an unbiased Bernoulli trial.
Further improvements of the algorithm will enhance the effective system photon
sensitivity by extracting useful information from events which would otherwise
be discarded.

coupling in gravity. This causes the zero-spinor solution to be unstable and
leads to spontaneous growth. We investigate the behavior of the resulting
theory for a spherically symmetric neutron star that has grown a spinor cloud.
Spontaneous spinorization has the potential to lead to order-of-unity
deviations from general relativity in strong fields in a similar manner to its
close relative spontaneous scalarization. This makes the theory especially
relevant to gravitational wave science and neutron star astrophysics.

and recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles will lead to the continued
growth of trajectory data and related applications. Supporting these services
in emerging platforms will require more efficient query processing in
trajectory databases. In this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for
trajectory databases: (i) k Maximizing Reverse Range Search on Trajectories
(kMaxRRST); and (ii) a Maximum k Coverage Range Search on Trajectories
(MaxkCovRST). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree
(TQ-tree) that utilizes a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into
different quadtree nodes, and then applies a z-ordering to further organize the
trajectories by spatial locality inside each node. This structure is highly
effective in pruning the trajectory search space, which is of independent
interest. By exploiting the TQ-tree data structure, we develop a
divide-and-conquer approach to compute the trajectory ""service value"", and a
best-first strategy to explore the trajectories using the appropriate upper
bound on the service value to efficiently process a kMaxRRST query. Moreover,
to solve the MaxkCovRST, which is a non-submodular NP-hard problem, we propose
a greedy approximation which also exploits the TQ-tree. We evaluate our
algorithms through an extensive experimental study on several real datasets,

low-complexity dematching based on generalized approximate message-passing

detector, sited 13 to 25 kilometres from a nuclear reactor complex.
Antineutrinos from the reactor interact in the water of the detector via an
inverse beta decay interaction resulting in two distinct cones of Cherenkov
light tens of milliseconds apart. Using this interaction WATCHMAN (WATer
Cherenkov Monitor for ANtineutrinos) will be the first detector to determine
the active/inactive status of a reactor complex at a stand-off greater than 10
kilometres. The water used in the detector will be doped with gadolinium,
providing the first demonstration of the potential of gadolinium doped
detectors for reactor monitoring and will confirm the potential of the
technology for use in larger multi-kiloton neutrino experiments. The proposed
WATCHMAN design will be a kiloton scale water based detector, constructed of a
16 metre diameter tank with a height of 16 metres and will comprise
approximately 3000 photomultiplier tubes.

of simple, perceptron-like neurons and exhibit nonlinear dynamics that are
determined by the network's connectivity. The fixed points of a TLN, including
both stable and unstable equilibria, play a critical role in shaping its
emergent dynamics. In this work, we provide two novel characterizations for the
set of fixed points of a competitive TLN: the first is in terms of a simple

these results to a special family of TLNs, called combinatorial
threshold-linear networks (CTLNs), whose connectivity matrices are defined from
directed graphs. This leads us to prove a series of graph rules that enable one
to determine fixed points of a CTLN by analyzing the underlying graph.
Additionally, we study larger networks composed of smaller ""building block""
subnetworks, and prove several theorems relating the fixed points of the full
network to those of its components. Our results provide the foundation for a

meanings of facial pixels, has been an important topic in the computer vision
community. However, most algorithms are designed for faces in small to medium
poses (yaw angle is smaller than 45 degrees), which lack the ability to align
faces in large poses up to 90 degrees. The challenges are three-fold. Firstly,
the commonly used landmark face model assumes that all the landmarks are
visible and is therefore not suitable for large poses. Secondly, the face
appearance varies more drastically across large poses, from the frontal view to
the profile view. Thirdly, labelling landmarks in large poses is extremely
challenging since the invisible landmarks have to be guessed. In this paper, we
propose to tackle these three challenges in an new alignment framework termed
3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA), in which a dense 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is
fitted to the image via Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks. We also utilize
3D information to synthesize face images in profile views to provide abundant
samples for training. Experiments on the challenging AFLW database show that
the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art methods.

popular choice for astronomical adaptive optics (AAO) systems, and it is at its
most sensitive when it is used without modulation of the input beam. In
non-modulated mode, the device is highly nonlinear. Hence, all PyWFS
implementations on current AAO systems employ modulation to make the device
more linear. The upcoming era of 30-m class telescopes and the demand for
ultra-precise wavefront control stemming from science objectives that include
direct imaging of exoplanets make using the PyWFS without modulation desirable.
This article argues that nonlinear estimation based on Newton's method for
nonlinear optimization can be useful for mitigating the effects of nonlinearity
in the non-modulated PyWFS. The proposed approach requires all optical modeling
to be pre-computed, which has the advantage of avoiding real-time simulations
of beam propagation. Further, the required real-time calculations are amenable
to massively parallel computation. Numerical experiments simulate a currently
operational PyWFS. A singular value analysis shows that the common practice of
calculating two ""slope"" images from the four PyWFS pupil images discards
critical information and is unsuitable for the non-modulated PyWFS simulated
here. Instead, this article advocates estimators that use the raw pixel values
not only from the four geometrical images of the pupil, but from surrounding
pixels as well. The simulations indicate that nonlinear estimation can be
effective when the Strehl ratio of the input beam is greater than 0.3, and the
improvement relative to linear estimation tends to increase at larger Strehl
ratios. At Strehl ratios less than about 0.5, the performances of both the
nonlinear and linear estimators are relatively insensitive to noise, since they
are dominated by nonlinearity error.

and condensed matter physics for many decades. Recently there has been
impressive progress in experimental realizations as well. Here we study vacuum
radiation when a field mode is driven both parametrically and by a classical
source. We find that in the Heisenberg picture the field operators of the mode
undergo a Bogolyubov transformation combined with a displacement, in the
Schr\""odinger picture the oscillator evolves from the vacuum to a squeezed
coherent state. Whereas the Bogolyubov transformation is the same as would be
obtained if only the parametric drive were applied the displacement is
determined by both the parametric drive and the force. If the force is applied
well after the parametric drive then the displacement is the same as would be
obtained by the action of the force alone and it is essentially independent of
$t_f$, the time lag between the application of the force and the parametric
drive. If the force is applied well before the parametric drive the
displacement is found to oscillate as a function of $t_f$. This behavior can be
understood in terms of quantum interference. A rich variety of behavior is
observed for intermediate values of $t_f$. The oscillations can turn off
smoothly or grow dramatically and decrease depending on strength of the
parametric drive and force and the durations for which they are applied. The
displacement depends only on the Fourier component of the force at a single
resonant frequency when the forcing and the parametric drive are well separated
in time. However for a weak parametric drive that is applied at the same time
as the force we show that the displacement responds to a broad range of
frequencies of the force spectrum. Implications of our findings for experiments
are briefly discussed.

given by imprecise measurements, a domain expert or even crowd sourcing.
Current formulations of regression are unable to use both types of guidance. We
propose a regression framework that can also incorporate weak guidance based on
relative orderings, bounds, neighboring and similarity relations. Consider
learning to predict ages from portrait images, these new types of guidance
allow weaker forms of guidance such as stating a person is in their 20s or two
people are similar in age. These types of annotations can be easier to generate
than strong guidance. We introduce a probabilistic formulation for these forms
of weak guidance and show that the resulting optimization problems are convex.

it exploits some of the discriminative and discarded negative information of
ReLU and 2) it also neglects the irrelevant and positive information used in
ReLU. The VGGFace model trained in MatConvNet over the VGG-Face dataset is used

service required for providing a seamless wireless connectivity demands needed
for emerging mobile applications. This paper evaluates the performance of some
selected key network parameters of a newly deployed LTE network in the 2600 MHz
band operating in the peculiar Sub-Saharan African terrain under varied MIMO
Antenna Configurations. We adopted simulation and field measurement to aid us
in our evaluation. Genex Unet has been used to simulate network coverage and
throughput performance of 2X2, 4X4 and 8X8 MIMO configurations of the deployed
networks. The average simulated throughput per sector of 4X4 MIMO configuration
was seen to be better than the 2X2 configuration. However, the percentage
coverage for users under the 2x2 MIMO simulation scenario was better than that
of the adaptive 4x4 MIMO configuration with 2x2 MIMO achieving 60.41% of
coverage area having throughput values between 1 - 40Mbps as against 55.87%
achieved by the 4x4 MIMO configuration in the peculiar deployment terrain.

  failure model investigation","14 pages, 9 figures","Physica A 505, 69-76 (2018)","10.1016/j.physa.2018.03.032",,"q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Margin trading in which investors purchase shares with money borrowed from
brokers is blamed to be a major cause of the 2015 Chinese stock market crash.
We propose a cascading failure model and examine how an increase in margin
trading increases share price vulnerability. The model is based on a bipartite
graph of investors and shares that includes four margin trading factors, (i)
initial margin $k$, (ii) minimum maintenance $r$, (iii) volatility $v$, and
(iv) diversity $s$. We use our model to simulate margin trading and observe how
the share prices are affected by these four factors. The experimental results
indicate that a stock market can be either vulnerable or stable. A stock market
is vulnerable when an external shock can cause a cascading failure of its share
prices. It is stable when its share prices are resilient to external shocks.
Furthermore, we investigate how the cascading failure of share price is
affected by these four factors, and find that by increasing $v$ and $r$ or
decreasing $k$ we increase the probability that the stock market will
experience a phase transition from stable to vulnerable. It is also found that
increasing $s$ decreases resilience and increases systematic risk. These
findings could be useful to regulators supervising margin trading activities.

organization and the evolutionary transitions of living systems. Understanding
how a system constitutes itself as an individual, cohesive, self-organized
entity is a fundamental challenge for the understanding of life. However, it is
generally a difficult task to determine whether the system or its environment
has generated the correlations that allow an observer to trace the boundary of
a living system as a coherent unit. Inspired by the framework of integrated
information theory, we propose a measure of the level of integration of a
system as the response of a system to partitions that introduce perturbations
in the interaction between subsystems, without assuming the existence of a
stationary distribution. With the goal of characterizing transitions in
integrated information in the thermodynamic limit, we apply this measure to
kinetic Ising models of infinite size using mean field techniques. Our findings
suggest that, in order to preserve the integration of causal influences of a
system as it grows in size, a living entity must be poised near critical points
maximizing its sensitivity to perturbations in the interaction between
subsystems. Moreover, we observe how such a measure is able to delimit an agent
and its environment, being able to characterize simple instances of
agent-environment asymmetries in which the agent has the ability to modulate
its coupling with the environment.
