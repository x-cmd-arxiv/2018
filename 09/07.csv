over mesoscopic length scales, namely, the grain size. We study the Poisuielle
flow of such materials in a rough channel. In general, similar to yield stress
fluids, three distinct dynamical states, namely, flowing, stick-slip and jammed
can be observed, with a yield threshold dependent on channel width.
Importantly, the interplay between the finite channel width, and the intrinsic
ordering scale (the grain size) leads to new type of spatiotemporal
heterogeneity. In wide channels, although the average flow profile remains plug
like, at the underlying granular level, there is vigorous grain remodelling
activity resulting from the velocity heterogeneity among the grains. As the
channel width approaches typical grain size, the flowing polycrystalline state
breaks up into a spatially heterogeneous mixture of flowing liquid like patches
and chunks of nearly static grains. Despite these static grains, the average
velocity still shows a parabolic profile, dominated by the moving liquid like
patches. However, the solid-liquid front moves at nearly constant speed in the
opposite direction of the external drive.

traditional trial-and-error approach by individual experiences of
pharmaceutical scientists, which is laborious, time-consuming and costly.
Recently, deep learning has been widely applied in many challenging domains
because of its important capability of automatic feature extraction. The aim of
this research is to use deep learning to predict pharmaceutical formulations.
In this paper, two different types of dosage forms were chosen as model
systems. Evaluation criteria suitable for pharmaceutics were applied to
assessing the performance of the models. Moreover, an automatic dataset
selection algorithm was developed for selecting the representative data as
validation and test datasets. Six machine learning methods were compared with
deep learning. The result shows the accuracies of both two deep neural networks
were above 80% and higher than other machine learning models, which showed good
prediction in pharmaceutical formulations. In summary, deep learning with the
automatic data splitting algorithm and the evaluation criteria suitable for
pharmaceutical formulation data was firstly developed for the prediction of
pharmaceutical formulations. The cross-disciplinary integration of
pharmaceutics and artificial intelligence may shift the paradigm of
pharmaceutical researches from experience-dependent studies to data-driven
methodologies.

sample-inefficiency in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but faces difficulty
in learning from binary and sparse rewards due to disproportionately few
successful experiences in the replay buffer. Hindsight experience replay (HER)
was recently proposed to tackle this difficulty by manipulating unsuccessful
transitions, but in doing so, HER introduces a significant bias in the replay
buffer experiences and therefore achieves a suboptimal improvement in
sample-efficiency. In this paper, we present an analysis on the source of bias
in HER, and propose a simple and effective method to counter the bias, to most
effectively harness the sample-efficiency provided by HER. Our method,
motivated by counter-factual reasoning and called ARCHER, extends HER with a
trade-off to make rewards calculated for hindsight experiences numerically
greater than real rewards. We validate our algorithm on two continuous control
environments from DeepMind Control Suite - Reacher and Finger, which simulate
manipulation tasks with a robotic arm - in combination with various reward
functions, task complexities and goal sampling strategies. Our experiments
consistently demonstrate that countering bias using more aggressive hindsight
rewards increases sample efficiency, thus establishing the greater benefit of
ARCHER in RL applications with limited computing budget.

attracted wide attention ever since its original discovery in 1996. However,
the spatial evolution of the magnetisation is not yet well understood, in part
due to the difficulty in experimentally probing such rapid dynamics. Here, we
find evidence of rapid magnetic order recovery in materials with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy via nonlinear magnon processes. We identify both
localisation and coalescence regimes, whereby localised magnetic textures
nucleate and subsequently evolve in accordance with a power law formalism.
Coalescence is observed for optical excitations both above and below the
switching threshold. Simulations indicate that the ultrafast generation of
noncollinear magnetisation via optical pumping establishes exchange-mediated
spin currents with an equivalent 100% spin polarised charge current density of
$10^8$ A/cm$^2$. Such large spin currents precipitate rapid recovery of
magnetic order after optical pumping. These processes suggest an ultrafast
optical route for the stabilization of desired meta-stable states, e.g.,
isolated skyrmions.

systems, more potential attack approaches are under research. In this paper, a
framework of the generative adversarial networks, called IDSGAN, is proposed to
generate the adversarial malicious traffic records aiming to attack intrusion

internal structure and parameters of the detection system are unknown to
attackers, the adversarial attack examples perform the black-box attacks
against the detection system. IDSGAN leverages a generator to transform
original malicious traffic records into adversarial malicious ones. A
discriminator classifies traffic examples and dynamically learns the real-time
black-box detection system. More significantly, the restricted modification
mechanism is designed for the adversarial generation to preserve original
attack functionalities of adversarial traffic records. The effectiveness of the
model is indicated by attacking multiple algorithm-based detection models with
different attack categories. The robustness is verified by changing the number
of the modified features. A comparative experiment with adversarial attack
baselines demonstrates the superiority of our model.

good agreement with our experimental data. Remarkably, upon knowledge of the

measuring its radial dimensions after adsorption. For all the systems studied
here, the interfacial dimensions are always larger than in bulk and the
particle core resides in a configuration wherein it just touches the interface

viscous drag at the interface, which appears to depend solely on the
interfacial dimensions, irrespective of the portion of the CSNP surface exposed

forward based on determining lower limits for the posterior probability of the
parameter lying in the special interval by means of a sensitivity analysis.
Since it is not assumed that prior beliefs necessarily need to be expressed in
terms of prior probabilities, nor that post-data probabilities must be Bayesian
posterior probabilities, hybrid methods of inference are also proposed that are
based on specific ways of measuring and interpreting the classical concept of
significance. The various methods that are outlined are compared and contrasted
at both a foundational level, and from a practical viewpoint by applying them
to real data from meta-analyses that appeared in a well-known medical article.

generic, probe quark-like defect degrees of freedom, in a strongly coupled

In this context, we explicitly show that a Schwarzian effective action for the

manifest on an open string worldsheet, as well as a D$1$-brane world-volume,
embedded in AdS$_3$. The corresponding maximal chaos is governed by an
intrinsic defect D-brane horizon, and an intrinsic non-linear description of
the brane or the string. We also present explicit evidence of maximal chaos
away from extremality on a D-brane horizon, by computing a four-point
out-of-time order correlator of spin-one operators. This further suggests that
a similar description of the soft sector physics of open string degrees of

Brownian map or Brownian disk) a.s. has a canonical conformal structure under
which it is equivalent to a $\sqrt{8/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG)
surface. In particular, Brownian motion on a Brownian surface is well-defined.
The construction in these works is indirect, however, and leaves open a basic
question: is Brownian motion on a Brownian surface the limit of simple random
walk on increasingly fine discretizations of that surface, the way Brownian
motion on $\mathbb R^2$ is the $\epsilon \to 0$ limit of simple random walk on
$\epsilon \mathbb Z^2$?
  We answer this question affirmatively by showing that Brownian motion on a
Brownian surface is (up to time change) the $\lambda \to \infty$ limit of
simple random walk on the Voronoi tessellation induced by a Poisson point
process whose intensity is $\lambda$ times the associated area measure. Among
other things, this implies that as $\lambda \to \infty$ the Tutte embedding
(a.k.a. harmonic embedding) of the discretized Brownian disk converges to the
canonical conformal embedding of the continuum Brownian disk, which in turn
corresponds to $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG.
  Along the way, we obtain other independently interesting facts about
conformal embeddings of Brownian surfaces, including information about the
Euclidean shapes of embedded metric balls and Voronoi cells. For example, we
derive moment estimates that imply, in a certain precise sense, that these
shapes are unlikely to be very long and thin.

applications in natural sciences, such as cyclic duplex DNA modeling. A flat
knotted ribbon can be obtained by gently pulling a knotted ribbon tight so that
it becomes flat and folded. An important problem in knot theory is to study the
minimal ratio of length to width of a flat knotted ribbon. This minimal ratio
is called the ribbonlength of the knot. It has been conjectured that the
ribbonlength has an upper bound and a lower bound which are both linear in the
crossing number of the knot.
  In the first part of the paper, we use grid diagrams to construct flat
knotted ribbons and prove an explicit quadratic upper bound on the ribbonlength
for all non-trivial knots. We then improve the quadratic upper bound to a
linear upper bound for all non-trivial torus knots and twist knots. Our
approach of using grid diagrams to study flat knotted ribbons is novel and can
likely be used to obtain a linear upper bound for more general families of
knots. In the second part of the paper, we obtain a sharper linear upper bound
on the ribbonlength for nontrivial twist knots by constructing a flat knotted
ribbon via folding the ribbon over itself multiple times to shorten the length.

current LHC searches do not robustly exclude any range of neutralino or

towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of $(m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0},
m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_3^0}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_4^0})$ = (8-155,

possible modest Higgsino or wino component. We find that this excess has a
combined local significance of $3.3\sigma$, subject to a number of cautions. If
one includes LHC searches for charginos and neutralinos conducted with 8 TeV
proton-proton collision data, the local significance is lowered to 2.9$\sigma$.

relic density can be obtained through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel
mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are decoupled. All samples,

simple shear and uniaxial extension. The rheology is governed by the bacterium
orientation distribution which satisfies a kinetic equation that includes
rotation by the imposed flow, and relaxation to isotropy via rotary diffusion
and tumbling. The relevant dimensionless parameters are the Peclet number
$Pe\equiv \dot{\gamma}\tau$, which dictates the importance of flow-induced
orientation anisotropy, and $\tau D_r$, which quantifies the relative
importance of the two intrinsic orientation decorrelation mechanisms (tumbling
and rotary diffusion). Here, $\tau$ is the mean run duration of a bacterium
that exhibits a run-and-tumble dynamics, $D_r$ is the intrinsic rotary
diffusivity of the bacterium and $\dot{\gamma}$ is the characteristic magnitude
of the imposed velocity gradient. The solution of the kinetic equation is
obtained numerically using a spectral Galerkin method, and yields the relevant
rheological properties over the entire range of $Pe$. For simple shear, the
stress relaxation predicted by our analysis at small $Pe$ is in good agreement
with the experimental observations of Lopez et al. (2015). However, the
analysis at large $Pe$ yields relaxations that are qualitatively different. The
rheological response in the experiments corresponds to a transition from a
nearly isotropic suspension of active swimmers at small $Pe$, to an apparently
(nearly) isotropic suspension of passive rods at large $Pe$. In contrast, the
computations yield the expected transition to a nearly flow-aligned suspension
of passive rigid rods at high $Pe$. We probe this active-passive transition

the origin. When $W$ has just one class of reflections and $\dim V>1$ this set
is an interval bounded by the positive and negative singular values of
respective smallest absolute value. This interval is always symmetric around
$0$ for the symmetric groups. This property does not hold in general, and the
icosahedral group $H_{3}$ provides a counterexample. The interval for
positivity of the Gaussian form is determined for each of the ten irreducible
representations of $H_{3}$.

convex integration to construct weak solutions $u$ to the 3D incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations such that $\| u(t) \|_{L^2} =e(t)$ for a given
non-negative and smooth energy profile $e: [0,T]\to \mathbb{R}$. However, it is
not known whether it is possible to extend this method to construct nonunique
suitable weak solutions (that is weak solutions satisfying the strong energy
inequality (SEI) and the local energy inequality (LEI)), Leray-Hopf weak
solutions (that is weak solutions satisfying the SEI), or at least to exclude
energy profiles that are not nonincreasing. In this paper we are concerned with
weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality on $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is
vector fields that satisfy both the SEI and the LEI (but not necessarily solve
the Navier-Stokes equations). Given $T>0$ and a nonincreasing energy profile
$e\colon [0,T] \to [0,\infty )$ we construct weak solution to the Navier-Stokes
inequality that are localised in space and whose energy profile $\| u(t)\|_{L^2
(\mathbb{R}^3 )}$ stays arbitrarily close to $e(t)$ for all $t\in [0,T]$. Our
method applies only to nonincreasing energy profiles. The relevance of such
solutions is that, despite not satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations, they
satisfy the partial regularity theory of Caffarelli, Kohn & Nirenberg (Comm.
Pure Appl. Math., 1982). In fact, Scheffer's constructions of weak solutions to
the Navier-Stokes inequality with blow-ups (Comm. Math. Phys., 1985 & 1987)
show that the Caffarelli, Kohn & Nirenberg's theory is sharp for such
solutions. Our approach gives an indication of a number of ideas used by
Scheffer. Moreover, it can be used to obtain a stronger result than Scheffer's.
Namely, we obtain weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality with both
blow-up and a prescribed energy profile.

calibrator's accuracy requirement is driven by the need to reduce upper limits
on cosmic polarization rotation, which is expected to be zero in a large class
of cosmological models. Cosmic polarization effects such as cosmic
birefringence and primordial magnetic fields can generate spurious B-modes that
result in non-zero CMB TB and EB correlations that are degenerate with a
misalignment of detector orientation. Common polarized astrophysical sources
used for absolute polarization angle calibration have not been characterized to
better than 0.5 degrees. Higher accuracy can be achieved through
self-calibration methods, however these are subject to astrophysical foreground
contamination and inherently assume the absence of effects like cosmic
polarization rotation. The deficiencies in these two calibration methods
highlight the need for a well characterized polarized source. The calibrator we
present utilizes a 76 GHz Gunn oscillator coupled to a frequency doubler,
pyramidal horn antenna, and co-rotating wire-grid polarizer. We use an accurate
bubble level in combination with four precision-grade aluminum planes located
within the enclosure to calibrate the source's linear polarization plane with
respect to the local gravity vector to better than the 0.1 degree goal. In 2017
the calibrator was deployed for an engineering test run on the POLARBEAR CMB

that particular systems are not in equilibrium. Here we discuss three

this velocity depends on the density of the other quasiparticles, so
equilibrium density fluctuations cause the front to follow a biased random
walk, and therefore to broaden diffusively. Ballistic front propagation and
diffusive front broadening are also generically present in non-integrable
systems in one dimension; thus, although the mechanisms for operator spreading
are distinct in the two cases, these coarse grained measures of the operator
front do not distinguish between the two cases. We present an expression for
the front-broadening rate; we explicitly derive this for a particular
integrable model (the ""Floquet-Fredrickson-Andersen"" model), and argue on
kinetic grounds that it should apply generally. Our results elucidate the
microscopic mechanism for diffusive corrections to ballistic transport in
interacting integrable models.

Universe from the collapse of large enough amplitude perturbations of the
metric. These correspond to non linear energy density perturbations
characterized by an amplitude larger than a certain threshold, measured when
the perturbations reenter the cosmological horizon. The process of primordial
black hole formation is studied here within spherical symmetry, using the
gradient expansion approximation in the long wavelength limit, where the
pressure gradients are small, and the initial perturbations are functions only
of a time-independent curvature profile. In this regime it is possible to
understand how the threshold for primordial black hole formation depends on the
shape of the initial energy density profile, clarifying the relation between
local and averaged measures of the perturbation amplitude. Although there is no
universal threshold for primordial black hole formation, the averaged mass
excess of the perturbation depends on the amplitude of the energy density peak,
and it is possible to formulate a well-defined criterion to establish when a
cosmological perturbation is able to form a black hole in terms of one of these
two key quantities. This gives understanding of how the abundance of primordial
black holes depends on the shape of the the inflationary power spectrum of
cosmological perturbations.

observed in Fornax - a prominent northern cold front and an inner southern cold

radius of NGC 1404, and its faint gas tail. Independent of the exact history,
we can make a number of predictions. A detached bow shock south of NGC 1404
should exist which is a remnant of the galaxy's previous infall at a distance
from NGC 1404 between 450 - 750 kpc with an estimated Mach number between 1.3

important to probe this poorly understood phase of CV evolution. We investigate
the evolution of the CV QZ Lib following its 2004 super-outburst using
multi-epoch spectroscopy. From time-resolved spectroscopic observations we
measure the orbital period of the system, $P_\mathrm{orb}= 0.06436(20)$ d,
which, combined with the superhump period $P_\mathrm{SH}= 0.064602(24)$ d,
yields the system mass ratio, $q = 0.040(9)$. From the analysis of the spectral
energy distribution we determine the structure of the accretion disc and the
white dwarf effective temperature, $T_\mathrm{eff} = 10\,500 \pm
1500\,\mathrm{K}$. We also derive an upper limit on the effective temperature
of the secondary, $T_\mathrm{eff} \lesssim 1700\,\mathrm{K}$, corresponding to
a brown dwarf of T spectral type. The low temperature of the white dwarf, the
small mass ratio and the fact that the donor is not dominating the
near-infrared emission are all clues of a post bounce system. Although it is
possible that QZ Lib could have formed as a white dwarf plus a brown dwarf

less likely than a period bouncer detection and we conclude that QZ Lib is a CV

CANDELS morphology catalogs, the RFs estimate a merger rate increasing to at
least z = 3, albeit two times higher than expected by theory. This suggests
possible mismatches in the feedback-determined morphologies, but affirms the

localization (MBL) in these systems. We investigate the dynamics of a state
with a nonequilibrium density profile; we find that at weak disorder the
density profile equilibrates rapidly, whereas for strong disorder it remains
frozen on the accessible timescales. We analyze this behavior in terms of the
Hartree-Fock self-energy. At weak disorder the self-energy fluctuates strongly
and can be interpreted as a self-consistent noise process. By contrast, at
strong disorder the self-energy evolves with a few coherent oscillations which
cannot delocalize the system. Accordingly, the non-equilibrium site-resolved
spectral function shows a broad spectrum at weak disorder and sharp spikes at
strong disorder. Our Hartree-Fock theory incorporates spatial fluctuations and
rare-region effects. As a consequence, we find subdiffusive relaxation in
random systems; but, when the system is subjected to weak quasi-periodic
potentials, the subdiffusive response ceases to exist, as rare region effects
are absent in this case. This self-consistent Hartree-Fock approach can be
regarded as a relatively simple theory that captures much of the MBL
phenomenology.

(ii) hydrodynamic variability in which the fueling of MBH accretion disks is
periodically modulated by the companion. Our models predict that numerous MBH

average spectral index of $\langle\alpha\rangle$ = -1.86 $\pm$ 0.02 when the

is double-peaked. We have carried out an analysis of single pulses at 8.4 GHz

components are emitted during a significant number of rotations. The resulting
single pulse flux density distribution is incompatible with a log-normal
distribution. The typical pulse width of the components is ~1.8 ms, and the
prevailing delay time between successive components is ~7.7 ms. Many of the
single pulse emission components show significant frequency structure over
bandwidths of ~100 MHz, which we believe is the first observation of such

cosmological zoom-in simulations of 30 halos to z=0: (1) without black holes
and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback and (2) with AGN feedback arising
from winds and X-ray radiation. We find that AGN feedback can alter the stellar
density distribution, reduce the core density within the central 1 kpc by 0.3
dex from z=1, and enhance the size growth of massive galaxies. We also find
that galaxies simulated with AGN feedback evolve along similar tracks to those
characterized by observations in specific star formation versus compactness. We
confirm that AGN feedback plays an important role in transforming galaxies from
blue compact galaxies into red extended galaxies in two ways: (1) it
effectively quenches the star formation, transforming blue compact galaxies
into compact quiescent galaxies and (2) it also removes and prevents new
accretion of cold gas, shutting down in-situ star formation and causing
subsequent mergers to be gas-poor or mixed. Gas poor minor mergers then build
up an extended stellar envelope. AGN feedback also puffs up the central region
through the fast AGN driven winds as well as the slow expulsion of gas while
the black hole is quiescent. Without AGN feedback, large amounts of gas
accumulate in the central region, triggering star formation and leading to
overly massive blue galaxies with dense stellar cores.

the general objective function is a divergence when D is optimal. However, this
view has been challenged due to inconsistencies between theory and practice. In
this paper, we discuss of the properties associated with most loss functions
for G (e.g., saturating/non-saturating f-GAN, LSGAN, WGAN, etc.). We show that
these loss functions are not divergences and do not have the same equilibrium
as expected of divergences. This suggests that G does not need to minimize the
same objective function as D maximize, nor maximize the objective of D after
swapping real data with fake data (non-saturating GAN) but can instead use a
wide range of possible loss functions to learn to generate realistic data. We
define GANs through two separate and independent D maximization and G
minimization steps. We generalize the generator step to four new classes of
loss functions, most of which are actual divergences (while traditional G loss
functions are not). We test a wide variety of loss functions from these four
classes on a synthetic dataset and on CIFAR-10. We observe that most loss
functions converge well and provide comparable data generation quality to
non-saturating GAN, LSGAN, and WGAN-GP generator loss functions, whether we use
divergences or non-divergences. These results suggest that GANs do not conform
well to the divergence minimization theory and form a much broader range of

a galaxy, a so-called tidal disruption event or TDE, may leave a debris disc
that subsequently accretes onto the hole. We solve for the time evolution of
such a TDE disc, making use of an evolutionary equation valid for both the
Newtonian and Kerr regimes. The late time luminosity emergent from such a disc
is of interest as a model diagnostic, as it tends to follow a power law
decline. The original simple ballistic fallback model, with equal mass in equal
energy intervals, produces a -5/3 power law, while standard viscous disc
descriptions yield a somewhat more shallow decline, with an index closer to
-1.2. Of four recent, well-observed tidal disruption event candidates however,
all had fall-off power law indices smaller than 1 in magnitude. In this work,
we revisit the problem of thin disc evolution, solving this reduced problem in
full general relativity. Our solutions produce power law indices that are in
much better accord with observations. The late time observational data from
many TDEs are generally supportive, not only of disc accretion models, but of
finite stress persisting down to the innermost stable circular orbit.

complexity features of cryptojacking scripts, and use them to detect
cryptojacking code among benign and other malicious JavaScript code, with an

expectations, due to the detailed relation ---including the same set of

which paradigmatically displays non-Gaussian fluctuations described by
Tracy-Widom distributions. We reach our conclusions via a dynamic
renormalization group study of the field statistics, confirmed by direct
evaluation of the field probability distribution function from numerical

two-dimensional materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide
monolayers, black phosphorene, and tellurene. Beyond pristine two-dimensional
materials, further tailored properties can be achieved by nanoporous patterns
such as nano- or atomic-scale pores (antidots) across the material. As one
example, structure-dependent electrical/optical properties for graphene antidot
lattices (GALs) have been studied in recent years. However, detailed charge
carrier scattering mechanism is still not fully understood, which hinders the
future improvement and potential applications of such metamaterials. In this
paper, the energy sensitivity of charge-carrier scattering and thus the
dominant scattering mechanisms are revealed for GALs by analyzing the maximum
Seebeck coefficient with a tuned gate voltage and thus shifted Fermi levels. It
shows that the scattering from pore-edge-trapped charges is dominant,
especially at elevated temperatures. For thermoelectric interests, the
gate-voltage-dependent power factor of different GAL samples are measured as
high as 509 at 400 K for a GAL with the square pattern. Such a high power
factor is improved by more than one order of magnitude from the values for the
state-of-the-art bulk thermoelectric materials. With their high thermal

magneto-hydro-static (MHS) model. We solve the MHS equations with the help of
an optimization principle and use vector magnetogram as boundary condition.
Positive pressure and density are ensured by replacing them with two new basic
variables. The Lorentz force during optimization is used to update the plasma
pressure on the bottom boundary, which makes the new extrapolation works even
without pressure measurement on the photosphere. Our code is tested by using a
linear MHS model as reference. From the detailed analyses, we find that the
newly developed MHS extrapolation recovers the reference model at high
accuracy. The MHS extrapolation is, however, numerically more expensive than
the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation and consequently one
should limit their application to regions where plasma forces become important,
e.g. in a layer of about 2 Mm above the photosphere.

reveal the existence of specific patterns adopted by protein sequences and
structures to deal with backbone self-entanglement. A large scale analysis of
the Protein Data Bank shows that loops significantly intertwined with another
chain portion are typically closed by weakly bound amino acids. Why is this
energetic frustration maintained? A possible picture is that entangled loops
are formed only toward the end of the folding process to avoid kinetic traps.
Consistently, these loops are more frequently found to be wrapped around a
portion of the chain on their N-terminal side, the one translated earlier at
the ribosome. Finally, these motifs are less abundant in natural native states
than in simulated protein-like structures, yet they appear in 32% of proteins,

fundamental C-H stretch band of CH${_4}$, with no instrumental line shape
distortions, at total pressures of 1000 mbar, 650 mbar, and 400 mbar. In this
first demonstration, a spectral resolution two orders of magnitude higher than

accomplished in a single interferogram measurement (200 s measurement time,
1000 MHz resolution, 1000 mbar total pressure) for an exciting power spectral
density of 42 {\mu}W/cm${^{-1}}$. A normalized noise equivalent absorption of
8x10${^{-10}}$ W cm${^{-1}}$ Hz${^{-1/2}}$ is obtained, which is only a factor
of three higher than the best reported with PAS based on continuous wave
lasers. A wide dynamic range of up to four orders of magnitude and a very good
linearity (limited by the Beer-Lambert law) over two orders of magnitude are

ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) Grus I (Gru I) and Triangulum II (Tri II).
Neither object currently has a clearly determined velocity dispersion, placing
them in an ambiguous region of parameter space between dwarf galaxies and
globular clusters. No significant metallicity difference is found for the two
Gru I stars, but both stars are deficient in neutron-capture elements. We
verify previous results that Tri II displays significant spreads in metallicity
and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Neutron-capture elements are not detected in our Tri II
data, but we place upper limits at the lower envelope of Galactic halo stars,
consistent with previous very low detections. Stars with similarly low
neutron-capture element abundances are common in UFDs, but rare in other
environments. This signature of low neutron-capture element abundances traces
chemical enrichment in the least massive star-forming dark matter halos, and
further shows that the dominant sources of neutron-capture elements in
metal-poor stars are rare. In contrast, all known globular clusters have
similar ratios of neutron-capture elements to those of halo stars, suggesting
that globular clusters form as part of relatively massive galaxies rather than
in their own dark matter halos. The low neutron-capture element abundances may
be the strongest evidence that Gru I and Tri II are (or once were) galaxies
rather than globular clusters, and we expect future observations of these
systems to robustly find non-zero velocity dispersions or signs of tidal
disruption. However, the nucleosynthetic origin of this low neutron-capture
element floor remains unknown.

something physically different might be associated with TNOs larger than 800
km. It could be that moderately red surfaces are older or less ice rich and
TNOs larger than 800 km have fresher surfaces or are able to hold onto more
volatile ices. Its also possible TNOs larger than 800 km are more fully
differentiated, giving them different surface compositions. A satellite at 0.17

the relative small size of 2013 FY27's satellite suggests it was created
through a direct collision, similar to satellites known around the largest

190 km in diameter, making the primary D = 740 +85-90 km.

production of unbiased samples from variability indices and statistical
parameters has not been achievable so far. We discuss the constraints used in
periodic signals detection methods as well as the uncertainties in the
estimation of periods and amplitudes. The frequency resolution necessary to
investigate a time series is assessed with a new approach that estimates the
necessary sampling resolution from shifts on the phase diagrams for successive

number of observations at the eclipses. As a result, the variability periods of
four EA up stars were determined. Moreover, we have a new approach to estimate
the amplitude and period variations. From these estimations information about
the intrinsic variations of the sources are obtained. For a complete
characterization of the light curve signal the period uncertainty and period
variation must be determined. Constraints on periodic signal searches were

star and a stellar or substellar companion is investigated. The tide raised in
the primary by the companion leads to an exchange of angular momentum between
the orbit and the stellar spin, causing the orbit to contract and the primary
to spin up. The rate of orbital decay is computed including both the
equilibrium tide, damped by turbulent viscosity in the convective envelope, and
the dynamical tide, assumed to be a traveling internal-gravity wave in the
radiative core. For close binaries, the tidal forcing period is expected to be
much shorter than the eddy turnover timescale in the convective envelope, and
the prescription for ""reduced"" viscosity is an important consideration. The
dynamical tide tends to dominate for the closest orbits, while the equilibrium
tide dominates for more distant orbits, with the crossover point depending on
the stellar mass. The spin up of the primary to synchronous rotation occurs for
sufficiently massive secondaries, and this greatly slows the orbital decay
until the Darwin instability occurs. A parameter survey is presented for
orbital decay as a function of primary and secondary mass, as well as turbulent
viscosity prescription. These results are summarized with analytic formulae and
numerical results for the age-dependent critical separation, $a_{\rm crit}$,
inside of which orbital decay is rapid, and few systems are expected to be
observed. The calculations of $a_{\rm crit}$ are compared with APOGEE binaries,

those proposed in [arXiv:1607.07224]: they involve in particular fields with
conformal weight $h_{r,s}$ where $r$ is dense on the real axis.

approximation on nondegenerate, convex quadrilaterals. In this paper, we
develop $\textit{direct serendipity}$ and $\textit{direct mixed}$ finite
element spaces, which achieve optimal approximation properties and have minimal
local dimension. The set of local shape functions for either the serendipity or
mixed elements contains the full set of scalar or vector polynomials of degree
$r$, respectively, defined directly on each element (i.e., not mapped from a
reference element). Because there are not enough degrees of freedom for global
$H^1$ or $H(\textrm{div})$ conformity, exactly two supplemental shape functions
must be added to each element. The specific choice of supplemental functions
gives rise to different families of direct elements. These new spaces are
related through a de Rham complex. For index $r\ge1$, the new families of
serendipity spaces ${\cal{DS}}_{r+1}$ are the precursors under the curl
operator of our direct mixed finite element spaces ${\mathbf{V}}_r$, which can
be constructed to have full or reduced $H(\textrm{div})$ approximation
properties. One choice of direct serendipity supplements is the precursor of
the recently introduced Arbogast-Correa spaces [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 54

can be defined without the use of mappings from reference elements, and these
give rise in turn to $\textit{fully}$ direct mixed spaces. Numerical results
are presented to illustrate the properties of the new spaces.

distill observations of the world into meaningful, predictive theories. In this
paper we present a new mechanism for logical theory acquisition which takes a
set of observed facts and learns to extract from them a set of logical rules
and a small set of core facts which together entail the observations. Our
approach is neuro-symbolic in the sense that the rule pred- icates and core
facts are given dense vector representations. The rules are applied to the core
facts using a soft unification procedure to infer additional facts. After k
steps of forward inference, the consequences are compared to the initial
observations and the rules and core facts are then encouraged towards
representations that more faithfully generate the observations through
inference. Our approach is based on a novel neural forward-chaining
differentiable rule induction network. The rules are interpretable and learned
compositionally from their predicates, which may be invented. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach on a variety of ILP rule induction and domain

including their size and shape. Here we apply brand new ARPES-based methods
that allow us to reconstruct the shape and size of the pairs in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+{\delta}}$. The pairs are seen to form a
characteristic starfish shape that is very long (>50{\AA}) in the near-nodal
direction but extremely short (~4.5{\AA}) in the antinodal (Cu-O) direction. We
find that this ultrashort antinodal length scale, which is of order a lattice
constant, is approximately constant over a wide range of doping levels even as
many other parameters including the pairing strength change. This suggests that
this new length scale, along with the pair shape, is one of the most
fundamental characteristics of the pairs. Further, the shape and ultrashort
length scale should make the pairs create or intertwine with variations in
charge and pair density, center on various types of lattice positions, and
potentially explain aspects of the nematic order in these materials.

We adopt adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods which are commonly used in
hydrodynamical simulations to efficiently explore the parameter space defined
by the semi-major axis and eccentricity damping timescales. We find that there
is a large region of phase space which produces systems in the chaotic Laplace
resonance and a smaller region consistent with the observed eccentricities and
libration amplitudes for the resonant angles. Under the assumptions of Type I
migration for the outer planet, we translate these damping timescales into
constraints on the protoplanetary disk surface density and thickness. When we
strongly (weakly) damp the eccentricities of the inner two Laplace planets,
these timescales correspond to disk surface densities around ten thousand (a
few hundred) grams per square centimeter and disk aspect ratios between 1-10%.
Additionally, smooth migration produces systems with a range of chaotic
timescales, from decades and centuries to upwards of thousands of years. In
agreement with previous studies, the less chaotic regions of phase space
coincide with the system being in a low energy double apsidal corotation
resonance. Our detailed modeling of multi-planetary systems coupled with our
AMR exploration method enhances our ability to map out the parameter space of
planet formation models, and is well suited to study other resonant chain
systems such as Trappist-1, Kepler-60, and others.

suggested to be harmfully biased towards some minority, with reports of racist
criminal behavior predictors, Iphone X failing to differentiate between two
Asian people and Google photos' mistakenly classifying black people as

believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender
neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI.
  In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it to build sentences in
constructions like ""He/She is an Engineer"" in 12 different gender neutral
languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate
these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect
statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender-neutral pronouns in
the translated output. We show that GT exhibits a strong tendency towards male
defaults, in particular for fields linked to unbalanced gender distribution
such as STEM jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS' data for the frequency
of female participation in each job position, showing that GT fails to
reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. We provide experimental
evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal
gender distribution, GT yields male defaults much more frequently than what
would be expected from demographic data alone.
  We are hopeful that this work will ignite a debate about the need to augment
current statistical translation tools with debiasing techniques which can

numerically study the anomalous Hall and topological Hall effects in a
four-band model that can properly describe the quantum well states in the
magnetic topological insulator films by combining Landauer-Buttiker formula and
the iterative Green's function method. Our numerical results suggest that
spin-orbit coupling in this model plays a different role in the quantum
transport in the clean and disordered limits. In the clean limit, spin-orbit
coupling mainly influences the longitudinal transport but does not have much
effect on topological Hall conductance. Such behavior is further studied
through the analytical calculation of scattering cross-section due to skyrmion
within the four-band model. In the disordered limit, the longitudinal transport
is determined by disorder scattering and spin-orbit coupling is found to affect
strongly the topological Hall conductance. This sharp contrast unveils a

dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) into water---an effective mechanism for CO2
storage in saline aquifers. Dissolution is associated with slow diffusion of
free-phase CO2 into the underlying aqueous phase followed by density-driven
convective mixing of CO2 throughout the water-saturated layer. We study the
fluid dynamics of CO2 convection in the single aqueous-phase region. A
comparison is made between two different boundary conditions in the top of the
formation: (i) a constant, maximum aqueous-phase concentration of CO2, and (ii)
a constant, low injection-rate of CO2, such that all CO2 dissolves instantly
and the system remains in single phase. The latter model is found to involve a
nonlinear evolution of CO2 composition and associated aqueous-phase density,
which depend on the formation permeability. We model the full nonlinear phase
behavior of water-CO2 mixtures in a confined domain, consider dissolution and
fluid compressibility, and relax the common Boussinesq approximation. We
discover new flow regimes and present quantitative scaling relations for global
characteristics of spreading, mixing, and a dissolution flux in two- and
three-dimensional media for both boundary conditions. We also revisit the
scaling behavior of Sherwood number (Sh) with Rayleigh number (Ra), which has
been under debate for porous-media convection. Our measurements from the
solutal convection in the range 1, 500<Ra<135, 000 show that the classical
linear scaling Sh ~ Ra is attained asymptotically for the
constant-concentration case. Similarly linear scaling is recovered for the
constant-flux model problem.

metallic dopants and nonmetallic impurities on grain boundary energy and

the grain boundary energy and the change in excess free volume of doped grain

impurity can fill the excess free volume more efficiently and further reduce
the grain boundary energy. We also find that the strengthening effects of
dopants and impurities are dominated by the electronic interactions between the
host Cu atoms and the two types of dopant elements. For example, the
significant competing effects of metal dopants such as Zr, Nb, and Mo with
impurities on the grain boundary strength are uncovered from the density of
states of the d electrons. As a whole, this work deepens the field's
understanding of the interaction between metallic dopants and nonmetallic

Cu-Zr-Ag, there is site competition because the preferred segregation sites are
the same. Finally, we find that thicker amorphous intergranular films can be

maximum-entropy filter freeze technique that can reduce over fitting. Two
filter pruning strategies -- global and layer-wise strategies, are compared.

the same accuracy drop threshold. Two-phase pruning, that is, combining both
global and layer-wise strategies, achieves 10 X FLOPs reduction and 46%

with feedback is a non-linear generalisation of the P\'olya urn, where the
probability of a new ball choosing a bin with $m$ balls is proportional to
$m^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ being the feedback parameter. It is known that if
the feedback is positive (i.e. $\alpha>1$) then the model is monopolistic:
there is a finite time after which one of the bins will receive all incoming
balls. We consider a time-dependent version of this model, where $\sigma_n$
independent balls are added at time $n$ instead of just one. We show that if
$\alpha>1$ then one of the bins gets all but a negligible number of balls, and
identify a phase transition in the growth of $(\sigma_n)$ between the
monopolistic and non-monopolistic behaviour. We also describe the critical
regime, where the probability of monopoly is strictly between zero and one.
Finally, we show that in the feedback-less case $\alpha=1$ no dominance occurs,
that is, each bin gets a non-negligible proportion of balls eventually. This is
in sharp contrast with a similar model where new balls added at time $n$ are
all placed in the same bin rather than independently.

In this work, we aim to lay a game-theoretic foundation by establishing a

deceptive APTs and their multi-stage multi-phase movement. The analysis of the
perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) enables a prediction of attacker's
behaviors and a design of defensive strategies that can deter the adversaries
and mitigate the security risks. A conjugate-prior method allows online
computation of the belief and reduces Bayesian update into an iterative
parameter update. The forwardly updated parameters are assimilated into the
backward dynamic programming computation to characterize a computationally
tractable and time-consistent equilibrium solution based on the expanded state
space. The Tennessee Eastman (TE) process control problem is used as a case
study to demonstrate the dynamic game under the information asymmetry and show
that APTs tend to be stealthy and deceptive during their transitions in the
cyber layer and behave aggressively when reaching the targeted physical plant.
The online update of the belief allows the defender to learn the behavior of
the attacker and choose strategic defensive actions that can thwart adversarial
behaviors and mitigate APTs. Numerical results illustrate the defender's
tradeoff between the immediate reward and the future expectation as well as the
attacker's goal to reach an advantageous system state while making the defender

sectors make the system of systems (SoS) vulnerable to natural or human-made
disasters and lead to cascading failures both within and across sectors. Hence,
the robustness and resilience of the interdependent critical infrastructures
(ICIs) against extreme events are essential for delivering reliable and
efficient services to our society. To this end, we first establish a holistic
probabilistic network model to model the interdependencies between
infrastructure components. To capture the underlying failure and recovery
dynamics of ICIs, we further propose a Markov decision processes (MDP) model in
which the repair policy determines a long-term performance of the ICIs. To
address the challenges that arise from the curse of dimensionality of the MDP,
we reformulate the problem as an approximate linear program and then simplify
it using factored graphs. We further obtain the distributed optimal control for
ICIs under mild assumptions. Finally, we use a case study of the interdependent
power and subway systems to corroborate the results and show that the optimal
resilience resource planning and allocation can reduce the failure probability
and mitigate the impact of failures caused by natural or artificial disasters.

the tachocline model provided a further reservoir for the toroidal field, which
slowed the average reversal period from 100 rotations to more than 220

example of a cyber attack used to damage an industrial control system
physically. This raised public awareness about the possibility of similar
attacks against other industrial targets -- including critical infrastructure.
In this paper, we use hypergames to analyze how adversarial perturbations, like
those used by Stuxnet, can be used to manipulate a system that employs optimal
control. Hypergames form an extension of game theory that enables us to model
strategic interactions where the players may have significantly different
perceptions of the game(s) they are playing. Past work with hypergames has been
limited to relatively simple interactions consisting of a small set of discrete
choices for each player, but here, we apply hypergames to larger systems with
continuous variables. We find that manipulating constraints can be a more
effective attacker strategy than directly manipulating objective function
parameters. Moreover, the attacker need not change the underlying system to
carry out a successful attack -- it may be sufficient to deceive the defender
controlling the system. It is possible to scale our approach up to even larger
systems, but the ability to do so will depend on the characteristics of the
system in question, and we identify several characteristics that will make
those systems amenable to hypergame analysis.

the tuning range of the cavity that can be used during an axion search. By
characterizing each mode crossing in detail, we show that some mode crossings

the role of neutral helium in partially ionized solar environments, the neutral
helium triplet (orthohelium) system provides important, yet under-utilized,
diagnostics of solar coronal rain. This work describes off-limb observations of
coronal rain in NOAA Active Region 12468 obtained in the He I 10830 $\AA$
triplet using the Massively MultipleXed Imaging Spectrograph experiment at the
Dunn Solar Telescope along with co-temporal observations from NASA's Solar
Dynamics Observatory and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. We detect
rain simultaneously in the IRIS 1400 $\AA$ and 2796 $\AA$ channels and in He I
10830 $\AA$. The large degree of spatial coherence present between all channels
agrees with previous observations of the multi-thermal nature of coronal rain.
A statistical analysis of He I spectral profiles for rain identified via
automated detection indicate He I line radiances are, on average, $10^{4}$ ergs
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$; the average translational velocity is 70 km
s$^{-1}$ and Doppler widths are distributed around 10 km s$^{-1}$. Based on
these results, forward models of expected He I polarized signals allow us to
estimate, using synthetic observables and an inversion algorithm including fits
for the scattering angle constraining the material's location along-the-line of
sight, the magnetic sensitivity of the upcoming National Science Foundation's
Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. We predict joint observations of the He I
10830 $\AA$ and 5876 $\AA$ multiplets, using first-light instrumentation, will
provide inverted magnetic field errors of $\pm3.5$ G ($2\sigma$) for spatial
scales of $0.5''$ ($\sim360$ km) assuming dynamically-limited integration times

contemporary probability theory. He cautioned that it was inadequate to specify
force of proof (probability of provability) for some kinds of uncertain
arguments. After 300 years, this gap remains in present-day probability theory.
We present axioms analogous to Kolmogorov's axioms for probability, specifying
uncertainty that lies in an argument's inference/implication itself rather than
in its premise and conclusion. The axioms focus on arguments spanning two
Boolean algebras, but generalize the obligatory: ""force of proof of A implies B
is the probability of B or not A"" in the case that the Boolean algebras are
identical. We propose a categorical framework that relies on generalized
probabilities (objects) to express uncertainty in premises, to mix with
arguments (morphisms) to express uncertainty embedded directly in
inference/implication. There is a direct application to Shafer's evidence
theory (Dempster-Shafer theory), greatly expanding its scope for applications.
Therefore, we can offer this framework not only as an optimal solution to a
difficult historical puzzle, but also to advance the frontiers of contemporary
artificial intelligence.

the possible existence of sterile neutrinos at about eV scale having
appreciable mixing with the already known three neutrinos. We find that if such
a light sterile neutrino exists, through a combined study of the leptonic
decays of $\mu^-$, $\tau^-$, $\pi^-$ and $K^-$, some semi-leptonic decays of
$\tau^-$ and the invisible decay width of the $Z$ boson, it is possible to
constrain the relevant mixing matrix elements. Furthermore, we compare the
constraints, derived by using the method presented here, with the experimental
results obtained from short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. We find
that a single light sterile neutrino cannot satisfy the existing short-baseline
neutrino oscillation constraints and explain the anomalies mentioned above.
Along the way we provide a number of experimentally clean observables which can
be used to directly study the light sterile neutrino independently of the
neutrino oscillation experiments.

recent years for their high efficiency and accuracy in measuring bubbly
two-phase flows. In this work, we proposed an architecture called bubble
generative adversarial networks (BubGAN) for the generation of realistic
synthetic images which could be further used as training or benchmarking data
for the development of advanced image processing algorithms. The BubGAN is
trained initially on a labeled bubble dataset consisting of ten thousand
images. By learning the distribution of these bubbles, the BubGAN can generate
more realistic bubbles compared to the conventional models used in the
literature. The trained BubGAN is conditioned on bubble feature parameters and
has full control of bubble properties in terms of aspect ratio, rotation angle,
circularity and edge ratio. A million bubble dataset is pre-generated using the
trained BubGAN. One can then assemble realistic bubbly flow images using this
dataset and associated image processing tool. These images contain detailed
bubble information, therefore do not require additional manual labeling. This
is more useful compared with the conventional GAN which generates images
without labeling information. The tool could be used to provide benchmarking
and training data for existing image processing algorithms and to guide the
future development of bubble detecting algorithms.

outsourcing of costly computations to cloud-computing platforms, as well as to
concerns about privacy of the collected sensitive data. This paper develops a
cloud-based protocol for a quadratic optimization problem involving multiple
parties, each holding information it seeks to maintain private. The protocol is
based on the projected gradient ascent on the Lagrange dual problem and
exploits partially homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation
techniques. Using formal cryptographic definitions of indistinguishability, the
protocol is shown to achieve computational privacy, i.e., there is no
computationally efficient algorithm that any involved party can employ to
obtain private information beyond what can be inferred from the party's inputs
and outputs only. In order to reduce the communication complexity of the
proposed protocol, we introduced a variant that achieves this objective at the
expense of weaker privacy guarantees. We discuss in detail the computational
and communication complexity properties of both algorithms theoretically and
also through implementations. We conclude the paper with a discussion on
computational privacy and other notions of privacy such as the non-unique
retrieval of the private information from the protocol outputs.

and tools for the highly valued data science challenge of mining knowledge
graphs. Since previous graph analytical methods have mostly focused on
homogeneous graphs, an important current challenge is extending this
methodology for richly heterogeneous graphs and knowledge domains. The
biomedical sciences are such a domain, reflecting the complexity of biology,
with entities such as genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, and phenotypes, and
relationships such as gene co-expression, biochemical regulation, and
biomolecular inhibition or activation. Therefore, the semantics of edges and
nodes are critical for representation learning and knowledge discovery in real
world biomedical problems. In this paper, we propose the edge2vec model, which
represents graphs considering edge semantics. An edge-type transition matrix is
trained by an Expectation-Maximization approach, and a stochastic gradient
descent model is employed to learn node embedding on a heterogeneous graph via
the trained transition matrix. edge2vec is validated on three biomedical domain
tasks: biomedical entity classification, compound-gene bioactivity prediction,
and biomedical information retrieval. Results show that by considering
edge-types into node embedding learning in heterogeneous graphs,
\textbf{edge2vec}\ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on all

bandwidth and at the same time as the primary users based on a multiple access

users provide a relaying service to the primary users in exchange for the
opportunity to send their messages towards their own destinations for a fixed
portion of the communication cycle. In addition, it is assumed that some
interferers are active during the communication cycle and cause interference
for the network. Furthermore, it is assumed that only partial channel state
information (CSI) between interferers and other nodes in the network is
available.
  We provide a robust optimization method against imperfection on the
interferers' CSI to maximize the joint primary and secondary
{signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)} with the assumption of limited

scheme is deployed at the secondary relays and the optimal beamforming is
obtained using second order convex programming (SOCP) method. The simulation

to all infinite sequence $(a_n )_{n\geqslant 1} $ of positive integers and
consider all these generalized E-sequences. We then define $(a_n )_{n\geqslant

$\Omega-$divergent if it is not the E-sequence of any odd positive integer. We
prove a remarkable fact that the $\Omega-$divergence of all non-periodic
E-sequences implies the periodicity of $(x_n )_{n\geqslant 0} $ for all $x_0$.
The principal results of this paper are to prove the $\Omega-$divergence of
several classes of non-periodic E-sequences. Especially, we prove that all
non-periodic E-sequences $(a_n )_{n\geqslant 1} $ with $\mathop {\overline

$\Omega-$divergent by using the Wendel's inequality and the Matthews and

results present a possible way to prove the periodicity of trajectories of all

raised the need for beyond-worst-case analysis. To this end, we study the
smoothed complexity of finding pure Nash equilibria in Network Coordination
Games, a PLS-complete problem in the worst case. This is a potential game where
the sequential-better-response algorithm is known to converge to a pure NE,
albeit in exponential time. First, we prove polynomial (resp. quasi-polynomial)
smoothed complexity when the underlying game graph is a complete (resp.
arbitrary) graph, and every player has constantly many strategies. We note that
the complete graph case is reminiscent of perturbing all parameters, a common
assumption in most known smoothed analysis results.
  Second, we define a notion of smoothness-preserving reduction among search
problems, and obtain reductions from $2$-strategy network coordination games to
local-max-cut, and from $k$-strategy games (with arbitrary $k$) to
local-max-cut up to two flips. The former together with the recent result of
[BCC18] gives an alternate $O(n^8)$-time smoothed algorithm for the
$2$-strategy case. This notion of reduction allows for the extension of
smoothed efficient algorithms from one problem to another.
  For the first set of results, we develop techniques to bound the probability
that an (adversarial) better-response sequence makes slow improvements on the
potential. Our approach combines and generalizes the local-max-cut approaches
of [ER14,ABPW17] to handle the multi-strategy case: it requires a careful
definition of the matrix which captures the increase in potential, a tighter
union bound on adversarial sequences, and balancing it with good enough rank
bounds. We believe that the approach and notions developed herein could be of
interest in addressing the smoothed complexity of other potential and/or
congestion games.

non-relational counterpart due to the combinatorially larger search space. As a
first step towards solving this problem, this paper presents a synthesis
technique that combines the counterexample-guided inductive synthesis framework
with a novel inductive synthesis algorithm that is based on relational version
space learning. We have implemented the proposed technique in a framework
called Relish, which can be instantiated to different application domains by
providing a suitable domain-specific language and the relevant relational
specification. We have used the Relish framework to build relational
synthesizers to automatically generate string encoders/decoders as well as
comparators, and we evaluate our tool on several benchmarks taken from prior
work and online forums. Our experimental results show that the proposed
technique can solve almost all of these benchmarks and that it significantly
outperforms EUSolver, a generic synthesis framework that won the general track
of the most recent SyGuS competition.

models suffer from the laborious model selection problem due to their high
model sensitivity. In particular, for tensor ring (TR) decomposition, the
number of model possibilities grows exponentially with the tensor order, which
makes it rather challenging to find the optimal TR decomposition. In this
paper, by exploiting the low-rank structure of the TR latent space, we propose
a novel tensor completion method which is robust to model selection. In
contrast to imposing the low-rank constraint on the data space, we introduce
nuclear norm regularization on the latent TR factors, resulting in the
optimization step using singular value decomposition (SVD) being performed at a
much smaller scale. By leveraging the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) scheme, the latent TR factors with optimal rank and the
recovered tensor can be obtained simultaneously. Our proposed algorithm is
shown to effectively alleviate the burden of TR-rank selection, thereby greatly
reducing the computational cost. The extensive experimental results on both

efficiency of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art algorithms.

with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, Phantom, from the beginning of
the Roche lobe overflow phase to the beginning of the self-regulated inspiral,
using three different resolutions. The duration of the Roche lobe overflow
phase is resolution dependent and would lengthen with increased resolution
beyond the $\sim$20 years observed, while the inspiral phase and the
post-common envelope separation are largely independent of resolution. Mass
transfer rates through the Lagrangian points drive the orbital evolution during
the Roche lobe overflow phase, as predicted analytically. The absolute mass
transfer rate is resolution dependent, but always within an order of magnitude
of the analytical value. Similarly, the gravitational drag in the simulations
is close to the analytical approximation. This gives us confidence that
simulations approximate reality. The $L_2$ and $L_3$ outflow observed during
Roche lobe overflow remains bound, forming a circumbinary disk that is largely
disrupted by the common envelope ejection. However, a longer phase of Roche
lobe overflow and weaker common envelope ejection typical of a more stable
binary may result in a surviving circumbinary disk. Finally, we examine the
density distribution resulting from the interaction for simulations that
include or omit the phase of Roche lobe overflow. We conclude that the degree
of stability of the Roche lobe phase may modulate the shape of the subsequent
planetary nebula, explaining the wide range of post-common envelope planetary

addressing many problems, from transportation and pollution to public safety,
among others. Using spatio-temporal analysis of vehicular mobility, promising
solutions can be proposed to alleviate these major challenges, utilizing shared
mobility and crowd-sourcing. The rise of transportation networks (e.g. Uber,
Lyft), is a mere beginning to shared mobility. In this paper, we address
problems of trip representation and matching. Particularly, we study a
real-world dataset of trips (from Cologne, Germany), from spatial and temporal
perspectives. Comparison of trajectories is desired for applications relying on
spatio-temporal phenomena. For that purpose, we present a novel combined
spatio-temporal similarity score, based on the weighted geometric mean (WGM)
and conduct experiments on its applicability and strengths. First, we use the
score to find clusters of trips that were spatially and/or temporally separable
using spectral clustering. The score is then used in a real-time matching of
trips for Catch-a-Ride (CaR) and CarPooling (CP) scenarios. CaR and CP achieve
$\approx40\%$ and $\approx25\%$ decrease in traveled distances respectively, at
the cost of moving to pick-up and from drop-off locations (i.e. drivers going
on average $<700m$ out of their way on pick-up and drop-off for CP).
Additionally, a comparison with the metrics available in the literature is
presented on CaR scenario. We find that main advantages of WGM include the
flexibility to favor time or space components, and linearity of runtime
complexity. Finally, we formulate an optimal free float Car-Sharing scenario
(e.g. scheduling a system of automated vehicles or taxis) resulting in an
average of $\approx3.88$ trips serviced by a car in one hour.

regarding galaxy formation. The most powerful diagnostics is the relative
abundance of {\alpha}-elements (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Ti) with respect to iron
(Fe), [{\alpha}/Fe], each of which is produced by different kinds of
supernovae. The existence of two distinct groups of stars in the solar
neighbourhood, one with high [{\alpha}/Fe] and another with low [{\alpha}/Fe],
suggests that the stars in the solar vicinity have two different origins.
However, the specific mechanism of the realization of this bimodality is
unknown. Here, we show that the cold flow hypothesis recently proposed for the
accretion process of primordial gas onto forming galaxies predicts two episodes
of star formation separated by a hiatus 6-7 Gyr ago and naturally explains the
observed chemical bimodality. We found that the first phase of star formation
that forms high [{\alpha}/Fe] stars is caused by the 'genuine' cold flow, in
which unheated primordial gas accretes to the galactic disk in a freefall
fashion. The second episode of star formation that forms low [{\alpha}/Fe]
stars is sustained by much slower gas accretion as the once-heated gas
gradually cools by radiation. The cold flow hypothesis can also explain the
large-scale variation in the abundance pattern observed in the Milky Way galaxy
in terms of the spatial variation of gas accretion history.

effect in a model system based on Weyl semimetals. We further show that the

coupling. In addition, we find that the corresponding shift in the elastic
cotunneling process shows different behaviors, and it vanishes when the two

hashing bits that degenerates retrieval performance in terms of both storage
and accuracy. This paper proposes a simple yet effective Neurons Merging Layer
(NMLayer) for deep supervised hashing. A graph is constructed to represent the
redundancy relationship between hashing bits that is used to guide the learning
of a hashing network. Specifically, it is dynamically learned by a novel
mechanism defined in our active and frozen phases. According to the learned
relationship, the NMLayer merges the redundant neurons together to balance the
importance of each output neuron. Moreover, multiple NMLayers are progressively
trained for a deep hashing network to learn a more compact hashing code from a
long redundant code. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.

yes. Our key observation is that video feeds from wide-area camera deployments
demonstrate significant content correlations (e.g. to other geographically

the first time, a method to exclusively evaluate the shell effects associated
with each of the nascent fragments (prefragments) generated by the neck
formation in nuclear fission processes. In spite of the strong indication of
such shell effects in asymmetric fragment mass distributions, they could not
have been accessed by any previous theoretical approach since most of the
single-particle wave functions are delocalized. In the POT, we have found that
the prefragment shell effects can be naturally and unambiguously identified as
the ontributions of the classical periodic orbits localized in each of the
prefragments. For a numerical test, simple cavity potential models are employed
with the shape described by the three-quadratic-surface shape parametrization.
Deformed shell energies are studied with the trace formula for degenerate
orbits in a runcated spherical cavity which was recently derived [K. Arita,

prefragment shell effect dominates the total shell energy shortly after the

role in establishing the fission saddle with asymmetric shape which leads to an
asymmetric scission.

these are attached at two different sites (104 and 123) on the TMV protein. The
resulting geometric information shows that the extent of disorder and
aggregation properties, and therefore the optical properties of the

chromophores and protein site to which they are bound. We used the results of
the conformational search as geometric parameters together with an improved
tight-binding Hamiltonian to simulate the linear absorption spectra and compare

and evolu-tion, occur over drastically different timescales, difficult to
reconcile within a unified framework. Development involves temporal sequences
of cell states controlled by hierarchies of regulatory structures. It occurs
over the lifetime of a single individual, and is associated to the gene
expression level change of a given genotype. Evolution, by contrast entails
genotypic change through the acquisition/loss of genes and changes in the
network topology of interactions among genes. It involves the emergence of new,
environmentally selected phenotypes over the lifetimes of many individuals.
Here we present a model of regulatory network evolution that accounts for both
timescales. We extend the framework of Boolean models of gene regulatory
networks (GRN)-currently only applicable to describing development to include
evolutionary processes. As opposed to one-to-one maps to specific attractors,
we identify the phenotypes of the cells as the relevant macrostates of the GRN.
A phenotype may now correspond to multiple attractors, and its formal
definition no longer requires a fixed size for the genotype. This opens the
possibility for a quantitative study of the phenotypic change of a genotype,
which is itself changing over evolutionary timescales. We show how the
realization of specific phenotypes can be controlled by gene duplication events
(used here as an archetypal evolutionary event able to change the genotype),
and how successive events of gene duplication lead to new regulatory structures
via selection. At the same time, we show that our generalized framework does
not inhibit network controllability and the possibility for network control
theory to describe epigenetic signaling during development.

functions around the ends of the source manifolds. We further show that a Morse
function $f:N\to \mathbb{R}$ is strongly stable (i.e. there exists a continuous
mapping $g\mapsto (\Phi_g,\phi_g)\in\operatorname{Diff}(N)\times
\operatorname{Diff}(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\phi_g\circ g\circ \Phi_g =f$ for
any $g$ close to $f$) if (and only if) $f$ is quasi-proper. This result yields
existence of a strongly stable but not infinitesimally stable function.

then trained 3D CNNs modified from three state-of-the-art 2D CNN architectures
(AlexNet, VGG-16 Net and Multi-crop Net) to extract the CNN features learned at
the output layer. For each 3D CNN, the CNN features combined with the 29
handcrafted features were used as the input for the support vector machine
(SVM) coupled with the sequential forward feature selection (SFS) method to
select the optimal feature subset and construct the classifiers. The fusion
algorithm takes full advantage of the handcrafted features and the highest
level CNN features learned at the output layer. It can overcome the
disadvantage of the handcrafted features that may not fully reflect the unique
characteristics of a particular lesion by combining the intrinsic CNN features.
Meanwhile, it also alleviates the requirement of a large scale annotated
dataset for the CNNs based on the complementary of handcrafted features. The
patient cohort includes 431 malignant nodules and 795 benign nodules extracted
from the LIDC/IDRI database. For each investigated CNN architecture, the
proposed fusion algorithm achieved the highest AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and

stringent constraints on the DM-SM interactions, while does not exclude the

$O(\sqrt{\kappa}\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which improves the previous result
$O(\kappa\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ provided by (Toth and Kelley, 2015) for

general nonlinear problems. Besides, if the hyperparameters (e.g., the
Lipschitz smooth parameter $L$) are not available, we propose a guessing

the organization of active maintenance, numerous studies on performance
degradation assessment have been conducted. However, previous research still
suffers from two deficiencies: 1) determining the relevant relationship among
diverse machine degradation states and assessing the specific degree of
deterioration and 2) determining the evolutionary relationships among
degradation and failure modes and assessing the failure modes corresponding to
different degradation scenarios. To address these two deficiencies, a novel
performance degradation assessment method is proposed. First, the
self-organizing feature map (SOM) network is used to mine the latent
degradation states of electrical machines. Second, the latent states are
quantified according to established statistical health indexes, and by
analyzing the distribution of extracted health indexes corresponding to
different degradation states, the relevant transition relationships of the
valid degradation states and the final evolving fault types are determined.
Third, a hybrid discrete HMM is developed to fully describe the transition
process among different states and assess the degradation scenario of a machine
in an online manner. The results of a real application of an electric point
machine show that the proposed method can identify valid degradation states and
obtain a superior assessment accuracy.

In the present work, we define a novel way of creating such ensemble by
exploiting similarity between the content of candidate summaries to estimate
their reliability. We define GlobalRank which captures the performance of a
candidate system on an overall corpus and LocalRank which estimates its
performance on a given document cluster. We then use these two scores to assign

are considered one of the most critical elements of a railway signal system.
The failure of the point mechanism directly affects the operation of the
railway and may cause serious safety accidents. Hence, there is a need for
early detection of the anomalies in PMs. From normal operation to complete
failure, the machine usually undergoes a series of degradation states. If the
degradation states are detected in time, maintenance can be organized in
advance to prevent the malfunction. This paper presents a degradation detection
method that can effectively mine and identify the degradation state of the PM.
First, power data is processed to obtain the feature set that can describe the
PM characteristics effectively. Then, a clustering analysis of the feature set
is carried out by self-organizing feature-mapping network, and various
degradation states are mined. Finally, the optimized support vector machine is
used to build the state classifier to identify the degradation state of the PM.
The experimental results obtained with the Siemens S700K PM show that the
proposed method could not only mine the effective degradation states, but also
obtain high identification accuracy.

individual competency (e.g. skills) is a critical success factor for agile
projects. While assuming that technical skills are important for every kind of
software development project, many researchers suggest that non-technical
individual skills are especially important in agile software development.
Objective: In this paper, we investigate whether non-technical individual
skills can predict the use of agile practices. Method: Through creating a set
of multiple linear regression models using a total of 113 participants from
agile teams in six software development organizations from The Netherlands and
Brazil, we analyzed the predictive power of non-technical individual skills in
relation to agile practices. Results: The results show that there is
surprisingly low power in using non-technical individual skills to predict
(i.e. explain variance in) the mature use of agile practices in software
development. Conclusions: Therefore, we conclude that looking at non-technical
individual skills is not the optimal level of analysis when trying to
understand, and explain, the mature use of agile practices in the software
development context. We argue that it is more important to focus on the
non-technical skills as a team-level capacity instead of assuring that all
individuals possess such skills when understanding the use of the agile
practices.

significant abundance effects observed for the Sun, provided that late and
relatively weak accretion did occur. The effects of cleansing may, however, be
affected by outflows from the Sun, the existence and dynamics of magnetic
fields and of the accretion disk, and the possible presence and location of the
Early Sun in a rich stellar cluster.

numerical simulations for a series of computational problems ranging from image
classification/image recognition, speech recognition, time series analysis,
game intelligence, and computational advertising to numerical approximations of
partial differential equations (PDEs). Such numerical simulations suggest that
ANNs have the capacity to very efficiently approximate high-dimensional
functions and, especially, indicate that ANNs seem to admit the fundamental
power to overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating the
high-dimensional functions appearing in the above named computational problems.
There are a series of rigorous mathematical approximation results for ANNs in
the scientific literature. Some of them prove convergence without convergence
rates and some even rigorously establish convergence rates but there are only a
few special cases where mathematical results can rigorously explain the
empirical success of ANNs when approximating high-dimensional functions. The
key contribution of this article is to disclose that ANNs can efficiently
approximate high-dimensional functions in the case of numerical approximations
of Black-Scholes PDEs. More precisely, this work reveals that the number of
required parameters of an ANN to approximate the solution of the Black-Scholes
PDE grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed
approximation accuracy $\varepsilon > 0$ and the PDE dimension $d \in
\mathbb{N}$. We thereby prove, for the first time, that ANNs do indeed overcome
the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of Black-Scholes
PDEs.

shown a continuing expansion of the remnant. As found in previous studies, we
find the torus model most accurately fits our data, and has shown a change in
the remnant expansion at Day 9,300 $\pm$210 from 2,300 $\pm$200 km/s to 3,610
$\pm$240 km/s. We have also seen an increase in brightness in the western lobe
of the remnant, although the eastern lobe is still the dominant source of
emission, unlike what has been observed at contemporary optical and X-ray
wavelengths. We expect to observe a reversal in this asymmetry by the year
$\sim$2020, and note the south-eastern side of the remnant is now beginning to
fade, as has also been seen in optical and X-ray data. Our data indicate that
high-latitude emission has been present in the remnant from the earliest stages
of the shockwave interacting with the equatorial ring around Day 5,000.
However, we find the emission has become increasingly dominated by the
low-lying regions by Day 9,300, overlapping with the regions of X-ray emission.
We conclude that the shockwave is now leaving the equatorial ring, exiting
first from the south-east region of the remnant, and is re-accelerating as it
begins to interact with the circumstellar medium beyond the dense inner ring.

gain. Experiments are performed on a large dataset with more than 3 million WCE

potential actions can be represented as a tree of sequential decisions. For an
effective action selection, MCTS performs many simulations to build a reliable
tree representation of the decision space. As such, a bottleneck to MCTS
appears when enough simulations cannot be performed between action selections.
This is particularly highlighted in continuously running tasks, for which the
time available to perform simulations between actions tends to be limited due
to the environment's state constantly changing. In this paper, we present an
approach that takes advantage of the anytime characteristic of MCTS to increase
the simulation time when allowed. Our approach is to effectively balance the
prospect of selecting an action with the time that can be spared to perform
MCTS simulations before the next action selection. For that, we considered the
simulation time as a decision variable to be selected alongside an action. We
extended the Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization applied to Tree (HOOT) method
to adapt our approach to environments with a continuous decision space. We
evaluated our approach for environments with a continuous decision space
through OpenAI gym's Pendulum and Continuous Mountain Car environments and for
environments with discrete action space through the arcade learning environment

objects. The balance between Class I, II, and, III fraction within the NESTs
suggests that they may be ordered as an evolutionary temporal scheme. We have
inferred that only 20\% of stars in Taurus do not belong to any kind of stellar
groups. The mass of NESTs covers the same range as that of dense molecular
cores. The distribution in size is bimodal peaking at 12.5 and 50 kAU and the
distribution of the number of YSOs in NESTs as a function of size exhibits two
regimes. We propose that the NESTs in their two size regimes represent the
spatial imprints of stellar distribution at birth as they may have emerged
within few millions years from their natal cloud either from a single core or
from a chain of cores. We have identified them as the preferred sites of star
formation in Taurus. These NESTs are the regions of highest stellar density and
intermediate spatial scale structures between ultra-wide pairs and loose
groups.

we introduce a novel deep generative model, called group-based variational

transformed differently; we thereby separately estimate a group-common factor

allows for learning to represent a general continuous space of contents, which
can accommodate unseen contents. Despite the simplicity, our model succeeded in
learning, from five datasets, content representations that are highly separate

magnons is constructed from the solution of a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the
two-particle (electron-hole) Green function, in which single-particle Stoner
and collective spin-wave excitations (magnons) are treated on the same footing.
Partial self-consistency is achieved by the alignment of the chemical
potentials. The resulting renormalized electronic band structures exhibit
strong spin-dependent lifetime effects close to the Fermi energy, which are
strongest in Fe. The renormalization can give rise to a loss of quasiparticle
character close to the Fermi energy, which we attribute to electron scattering
with spatially extended spin waves. This scattering is also responsible for
dispersion anomalies in conduction bands of iron and for the formation of
satellite bands in nickel. Furthermore, we find a band anomaly at a binding
energy of 1.5~eV in iron, which results from a coupling of the quasihole with
single-particle excitations that form a peak in the Stoner continuum. This band
anomaly was recently observed in photoemission experiments. On the theory side,
we show that the contribution of the Goldstone mode to the $GT$ self-energy is

a set of initial and final state pairs in some grid space, and determining for

primitive in the database that joins it to an existing node. The tree is
rewired if some nodes can be reached from the new sampled state through an

numerically in a situation in which an external magnetic field is applied
parallel and antiparallel, respectively, to its initial magnetization

curves, from which a critical magnetic field strength (i.e., the one at which
the ferronematic sample becomes distorted) as function of the system parameters
can be inferred. Two possible mechanisms of switching the magnetization by
applying a magnetic field in the antiparallel direction are observed and
characterized in terms of the coupling constant between the magnetization and
the nematic director as well as in terms of the coupling strength of the

time-to-event information with data censorship handling, which has been widely
used in many applications such as clinical research, information system and
other fields with survivorship bias. Many works have been proposed for survival
analysis ranging from traditional statistic methods to machine learning models.
However, the existing methodologies either utilize counting-based statistics on
the segmented data, or have a pre-assumption on the event probability
distribution w.r.t. time. Moreover, few works consider sequential patterns
within the feature space. In this paper, we propose a Deep Recurrent Survival
Analysis model which combines deep learning for conditional probability
prediction at fine-grained level of the data, and survival analysis for
tackling the censorship. By capturing the time dependency through modeling the
conditional probability of the event for each sample, our method predicts the
likelihood of the true event occurrence and estimates the survival rate over
time, i.e., the probability of the non-occurrence of the event, for the
censored data. Meanwhile, without assuming any specific form of the event
probability distribution, our model shows great advantages over the previous
works on fitting various sophisticated data distributions. In the experiments
on the three real-world tasks from different fields, our model significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions under various metrics.

modeling the locations of interferers as a Poisson Point Process (PPP).
However, in many cases, the complicated nature of this correlation limits the
analytical tractability of the PPP-based approach. For example, for an
interference-aware $N$-antenna Maximum-Ratio Combining (MRC) receiver, the
analytical expression for outage probability is available only for $N=2$. For
$N>2$, the exact analysis using standard PPP-based approach becomes intractable
because of which one has to either resort to bounds or to simulations. In this
letter, we overcome this issue and derive the MRC outage probability for an
arbitrary $N$ by employing the mixture-based method of modeling the correlation
in the interference powers. This method offers a much simpler analytical
structure to the correlated interference, thereby lending analytical
tractability to such analyses. The mixture parameter ($q$) is tuned based on
the matching of joint Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) statistics, which
results in a very accurate mixture-based result. The tightness of these
approximations is verified using Monte Carlo simulations.

spin induced in the evanescent region outside the waveguide), carrying indeed
longitudinal extraordinary (so-called) Belinfante's spin momentum. Such
contribution depends linearly on the mode transverse wave vector, and is thus
induced by mode confinement. Cylindrical waveguides support in addition hybrid
modes that exhibit a richer phenomenology with not only azimuthal
(confinement-related) spin, but also an intrinsic helicity which leads to
longitudinal spin density and transverse helicity-dependent spin momentum.
Results are indeed presented for configurations relevant to spin-orbit coupling
in nanophotonic waveguides and to manipulating optical forces in
IR-to-microwave water-filled channels. Thus guided modes intrinsically carrying

loops, and the emission is widely ascribed to bremsstrahlung. We here revisit
an alternative scenario which stresses the importance of inverse Compton
processes and the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI) proposed by Fang et al.
(2016). This scenario adds a novel ingredient to the standard flare model,
where evaporation flows from flare-impacted chromospheric foot-points interact
with each other near the loop top and produce turbulence via KHI. The
turbulence can act as a trapping region and as an efficient accelerator to
provide energetic electrons, which scatter soft X-ray (SXR) photons to HXR
photons via the inverse Compton mechanism. This paper focuses on the trigger of
the KHI and the resulting turbulence in this new scenario. We perform a
parameter survey to investigate the necessary ingredients to obtain KHI through
interaction of chromospheric evaporation flows. When turbulence is produced in
the loop apex, an index of -5/3 can be found in the spectra of velocity and
magnetic field fluctuations. The KHI development and the generation of
turbulence are controlled by the amount of energy deposited in the
chromospheric foot-points and the time scale of its energy deposition, but
typical values for M class flares show the KHI development routinely. Asymmetry
of energy deposition determines the location where the turbulence is produced,
and the synthesized SXR light curve shows a clear periodic signal related to
the sloshing motion of the vortex pattern created by the KHI.

(ACC) and the \textit{abelian color flux} (ACF) methods to several models: the
SU(2) principal chiral model, the SU(2) gauge theory with staggered fermions
and QCD with staggered fermions. The key step of our approaches consists in
decomposing the action of the model one is considering into its minimal units.
For gauge theories those minimal terms are complex numbers, which we refer to
as abelian color cycles, while for fermions the action is decomposed into
Grassmann bilinears, which we called abelian color fluxes. As a result of these
decompositions the actions are sums of commuting terms, and thus one can
proceed with the dualization of the theory as in the abelian case, by
factorizing and expanding the Boltzmann weight. The expansion indices,
so-called dual variables, become the new degrees of freedom for the description
of the system once the conventional fields are integrated out. The integration
over the conventional fields results into weight factors and constraints. The
constraints implement the symmetries of the theory in the dual form and imply
that the dual configurations which contribute to the long range physics are
worldsheets for the gauge degrees of freedom and worldlines for matter fields.
On the other hand, the weight factors allow one to organize the dual partition
function into a strong coupling series of which all terms are known in closed
form. Moreover, the form of the dependence on the chemical potential allows one
to identify the net-particle number as the total net temporal winding number of
the worldlines in the dual representation.

and validating the predictions of such models, through the circular dichroism

three widely used models, each dominant at different nanoparticle separations
and governed by its own physical mechanism, namely the hydrodynamic Drude
model, the generalised nonlocal optical response theory, and the
quantum-corrected model for tunnelling. Our calculations show that indeed, each
case is characterised by a fundamentally distinctive response, always
dissimilar to the predictions of the local optical response approximation of
classical electrodynamics, dominated by a model-sensitive absorptive
double-peak feature. In circular dichroism spectra, the striking differences
between models manifest themselves as easily traceable sign changes rather than

evolution. There are two types of species in the ice bulk in the new multiphase

temperatures while normal species are locked in the ice bulk. Photodissociation
rates of icy species are reduced by the exponential decay of UV flux within the
ice mantle. Two-phase models and basic multiphase models without bulk diffusion
and photon penetration are also simulated for comparison. Our physical model
for the collapsing core is base on a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
model. Abundant icy radicals are produced at around 10 K in the new multiphase
models. Interstitial radicals can diffuse inside ice mantles to form complex
organic molecules (COMS) upon warming-up. Thus, COMs produced by radical
recombination at higher temperatures in the new multiphase models are more than

expressions for small chimeras and synchronous states which correspond to
nonchaotic attractors in the model. We also numerically study the bifurcations

manifests itself in the short term flux oscillations with erratically
fluctuating amplitudes, exponential escape time distribution and irregular
dependence of the escape time to initial conditions. We classify the small

with an asymptotically close to zero energy dissipation per operation - serving
as an alternative technology for many scenarios where energy efficiency is
preferred over fast execution. Their concepts are motivated by the fact that
the information lost from conventional circuits results in an entropy increase
which causes energy dissipation. To overcome this issue, computations are
performed in a (conditionally) reversible fashion which, additionally, have to
satisfy switching rules that are different from conventional circuitry - crying
out for dedicated design automation solutions. While previous approaches either
focus on their electrical realization (resulting in small, hand-crafted
circuits only) or on designing fully reversible building blocks (an unnecessary
overhead), this work aims for providing an automatic and dedicated design
scheme that explicitly takes the recent findings in this domain into account.
To this end, we review the theoretical and technical background of adiabatic
circuits and present automated methods that dedicatedly realize the desired
function as an adiabatic circuit. The resulting methods are further optimized -
leading to an automatic and efficient design automation for this promising
technology. Evaluations confirm the benefits and applicability of the proposed

Throughout this article we assume that the set $S$ is GCD closed. The LCM
matrix $[S]$ of the set $S$ is defined to be the $n\times n$ matrix with
$\mathrm{lcm}(x_i,x_j)$ as its $ij$ element. The famous Bourque-Ligh conjecture
used to state that the LCM matrix of a GCD closed set $S$ is always invertible,
but currently it is a well-known fact that any nontrivial LCM matrix is
indefinite and under the right circumstances it can be even singular (even if
the set $S$ is assumed to be GCD closed). However, not much more is known about
the inertia of LCM matrices in general. The ultimate goal of this article is to
improve this situation. Assuming that $S$ is a meet closed set we define an
entirely new lattice-theoretic concept by saying that an element $x_i\in S$
generates a double-chain set in $S$ if the set
$\mathrm{meetcl}(C_S(x_i))\setminus C_S(x_i)$ can be expressed as a union of
two disjoint chains (here the set $C_S(x_i)$ consists of all the elements of
the set $S$ that are covered by $x_i$ and $\mathrm{meetcl}(C_S(x_i))$ is the
smallest meet closed subset of $S$ that contains the set $C_S(x_i)$). We then
proceed by studying the values of the M\""obius function on sets in which every
element generates a double-chain set and use the properties of the M\""obius
function to explain why the Bourque-Ligh conjecture holds in so many cases and
fails in certain very specific instances. After that we turn our attention to
the inertia and see that in some cases it is possible to determine the inertia
of an LCM matrix simply by looking at the lattice-theoretic structure of
$(S,|)$ alone. Finally, we are going to show how to construct LCM matrices in
which the majority of the eigenvalues is either negative or positive.

carry out next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the decay of $Z$ boson
into $\chi_c$ and $\chi_b$, respectively. The branching ratio of $Z \to
\chi_{c}(\chi_b)+X$ is about $10^{-5}(10^{-6})$. It is found that, for $Z \to
\chi_c(\chi_b)+X$, the single gluon fragmentation diagrams of $^3S_1^{[8]}$,
which first appear at the NLO level, can provide significant contributions,
leading to a great enhancement on the leading-order results. Consequently the
contributions from the color octet (CO) channels will account for a large
proportion of the total decay widths. Moreover, the introduction of the CO
processes will thoroughly change the color singlet (CS) predictions on the
ratios of $\Gamma_{\chi_{c1}}/\Gamma_{\chi_{c0}}$,
$\Gamma_{\chi_{c2}}/\Gamma_{\chi_{c0}}$,
$\Gamma_{\chi_{b1}}/\Gamma_{\chi_{b0}}$ and

condensate drops shed with relatively smaller radii due to the ac-EW-induced
reduction of contact angle hysteresis. The smaller shedding radius, coupled
with the enhanced growth due to coalescence under EW, results in increased
shedding rate. We also show that the condensate droplet pattern under EW can be
controlled, and the coalescence can be further enhanced, using interdigitated
electrodes with zigzag edges. Such enhanced coalescence in conjunction with the
electrically-induced trapping effect due to the electrode geometry results in
larger shedding radius, but lower shedding rate. However, the shedding
characteristics can be further optimized by applying the electrical voltage
intermittently. We finally provide an estimate of the condensate volume removed

SDMs are the description for species distribution response along environmental
covariates and the spatial random effect. Joint species distribution models
(JSDMs) additionally include interspecific correlations which have been shown
to improve their descriptive and predictive performance compared to single
species models. Current JSDMs are restricted to hierarchical generalized linear
modeling framework. These parametric models have trouble in explaining changes
in abundance due, e.g., highly non-linear physical tolerance limits which is
particularly important when predicting species distribution in new areas or
under scenarios of environmental change. On the other hand, semi-parametric
response functions have been shown to improve the predictive performance of
SDMs in these tasks in single species models. Here, we propose JSDMs where the
responses to environmental covariates are modeled with additive multivariate
Gaussian processes coded as linear models of coregionalization. These allow
inference for wide range of functional forms and interspecific correlations
between the responses. We propose also an efficient approach for inference with
Laplace approximation and parameterization of the interspecific covariance

two small scale examples and one real world case study. We use cross-validation

circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we propose a heuristic approach to
efficiently compute price adjustments. To demonstrate our strategy's
applicability even if the number of competitors is large and their strategies

frequently and strategically adjust their prices. For all settings, we verify
that our heuristic strategy yields promising results. We compare the

optimal strategies that take advantage of perfect price anticipations. We find
that price adjustment frequencies can have a larger impact on expected profits
than price anticipations. Finally, our approach has been applied on Amazon for

of finding a set of densest subgraphs. Some approaches aim at finding disjoint

An approach introduced to find possible overlapping subgraphs is the Top-k
Overlapping Densest Subgraphs problem. For a given integer k >= 1, the goal of

namely, the alternating chimera, in a network of identical neuronal systems
induced by an external electromagnetic field. Owing to this interaction
scenario, the nonlinear neuronal oscillators are coupled indirectly via
electromagnetic induction with magnetic flux, through which neurons communicate
in spite of the absent physical connections among them. The evolution of each
neuron, here, is described by the three-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose dynamics. We
demonstrate that the presence of such non-locally and globally interacting
external environments induce a stationary alternating chimera pattern in the
ensemble of neurons, whereas in the local coupling limit the network exhibits
transient chimera state whenever the local dynamics of the neurons is of
chaotic square-wave bursting type. For periodic square-wave bursting of the
neurons, similar qualitative phenomenon has been witnessed with the exception
of the disappearance of cluster states for non-local and global interactions.
Besides these observations, we advance our work while providing confirmation of
the findings for neuronal ensembles exhibiting plateau bursting dynamics. These
results may deliver better interpretations for different aspects of
synchronization appearing in network of neurons through field coupling that
also relaxes the prerequisite of synaptic connectivity for realizing chimera
state in neuronal networks.

extremely useful in dealing with density estimation and clustering problems in
a wide range of domains. Motivated by an astronomical application, in this work
we address the robustness of DPM-G models to affine transformations of the
data, a natural requirement for any sensible statistical method for density
estimation and clustering. First, we devise a coherent prior specification of
the model which makes posterior inference invariant with respect to affine
transformations of the data. Second, we formalise the notion of asymptotic
robustness under data transformation and show that mild assumptions on the true
data generating process are sufficient to ensure that DPM-G models feature such
a property. Our investigation is supported by an extensive simulation study and
illustrated by the analysis of an astronomical dataset consisting of physical
measurements of stars in the field of the globular cluster NGC 2419.

fundamental understanding of them is missing, so most technological
applications are being developed via trial and error. In the majority of plasma
simulations surface processes are either neglected or treated via
phenomenological parameters such as sticking coefficients, sputter rates or
secondary electron emission coefficients. However, those parameters are known
only in some cases and with very limited accuracy. Similarly, while surface

so far, the influence of a plasma medium and correlations between successive

coupled plasma-solid simulations. We briefly summarize relevant theoretical
methods from solid state and surface physics that are suitable to contribute to
such an approach and identify four methods. The first are mesoscopic
simulations such as kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) that
are able to treat complex processes on large scales but neglect electronic

Simulations of late time ($t > 400$ d) H$\alpha$ suggest that, apart from the

previous H$\alpha$ and [S II] observations. The total mass of the molecular
clouds is $\sim$$800$ $M_{\odot}$ for the shock-ionized region and $\sim$$1700$

reveals that the absorbing column densities toward the molecular clouds are
$\sim$$1.5$-$6.0\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, which are $\sim$$1.5$-$15$ times less
than the averaged interstellar proton column densities for each region. This
means that the X-rays are produced not only behind the molecular clouds, but

completely engulfed by the shock waves, but have still survived erosion owing
to their high-density and short interacting time. The X-ray spectrum toward the

effect with perfect quantization of the Hall resistance. A rigorous
demonstration of this general paradigm is still limited by the difficulty in
solving models of quantum Hall bars with macroscopic lateral dimensions and
smooth disorder. We propose here the exact solution of a simple model
exhibiting similarly two sharp transitions that are triggered by the
competition of cyclotron motion and potential-induced drift. As a function of
increasing magnetic field, one observes indeed three distinct phases showing
respectively fully broken, partially smeared, or perfect Landau level
quantization. This model is based on a non-rotationally invariant, inverted
two-dimensional harmonic potential, from which a full quantum solution is
obtained using 4D phase space quantization. The developed formalism unifies all
three possible regimes under a single analytical theory, as well as arbitrary
quadratic potentials, for all magnetic field values.

polarization gradient of the trapping light fields, which leads to a spatially

additional light field, we demonstrate the in-situ tuning of the coupling

interpolates a random pair of training examples and correspondingly the one-hot

additional data is shown capable of significantly improving the predictive
accuracy of the current art. The power of MixUp, however, is primarily
established empirically and its working and effectiveness have not been
explained in any depth. In this paper, we develop an understanding for MixUp as
a form of ""out-of-manifold regularization"", which imposes certain ""local
linearity"" constraints on the model's input space beyond the data manifold.
This analysis enables us to identify a limitation of MixUp, which we call
""manifold intrusion"". In a nutshell, manifold intrusion in MixUp is a form of
under-fitting resulting from conflicts between the synthetic labels of the
mixed-up examples and the labels of original training data. Such a phenomenon
usually happens when the parameters controlling the generation of mixing
policies are not sufficiently fine-tuned on the training data. To address this
issue, we propose a novel adaptive version of MixUp, where the mixing policies
are automatically learned from the data using an additional network and
objective function designed to avoid manifold intrusion. The proposed
regularizer, AdaMixUp, is empirically evaluated on several benchmark datasets.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaMixUp improves upon MixUp when
applied to the current art of deep classification models.

dioxide (CO$_2$) are examined using large eddy simulations featuring actively
reacting carbonate chemistry in the ocean mixed layer at small scales. Four
strengths of Langmuir turbulence are examined with three types of carbonate
chemistry: time-dependent, instantaneous equilibrium chemistry, and no
reactions. The time-dependent model is obtained by reducing a detailed
eight-species chemical mechanism using computational singular perturbation
analysis, resulting in a quasi-steady-state approximation for hydrogen ion
(H$^+$), i.e., fixed pH. The reduced mechanism is then integrated in two
half-time steps before and after the advection solve using a
Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev scheme that is robust for stiff systems of differential
equations. The simulations show that, as the strength of Langmuir turbulence
increases, CO$_2$ fluxes are enhanced by rapid overturning of the near-surface
layer, which rivals the removal rate of CO$_2$ by time-dependent reactions.
Equilibrium chemistry and non-reactive models are found to bring more and less
carbon, respectively, into the ocean as compared to the more realistic
time-dependent model. These results have implications for Earth system models
that either neglect Langmuir turbulence or use equilibrium, instead of
time-dependent, chemical mechanisms.

the neural tissue operates in a near synchronous regime, and hence, cannot
account for changes in the underlying synchrony of patterns. It is customary to
use spiking neural network models when examining within population
synchronisation. Unfortunately, these high dimensional models are notoriously
hard to obtain insight from. In this paper, we consider a network of

of space and a realistic synapse model leads to a reduced model that has many

instability analysis and numerical continuation software are used to explore
the existence and stability of spatio-temporal patterns in the system. In

this, and we consider weighted-graph observations in two situations, 1) where
each graph belongs to one of two populations, and 2) where entities belong to
one of two populations, with each entity possessing multiple graphs (indexed
e.g. by time). Specifically, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian hypothesis
testing framework that models each population with a mixture of latent space
models for weighted networks, and then tests populations of networks for
differences in distribution over components. Our framework is capable of
population-level, entity-specific, as well as edge-specific hypothesis testing.

directly from the $\sqrt{s}$-dependence of the initial jet $p_T$ spectra and
slow $p_T$-dependence of the jet energy loss. Contributions from jet-induced
medium response, influence of radial expansion, both of which depend on
jet-cone size, and jet flavor composition all conjoin to give a slow

inclusive jet suppression at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV is also predicted that actually
decreases slightly with $p_T$ in the $p_T<50$ GeV/$c$ range because of the

velocity-space anisotropy is naturally generated as a result of the different
adiabatic conservation laws parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.
When the compression timescale is comparable to the collision timescale, and
both are much longer than the gyroperiod, this pressure anisotropy can become
significant. We show that this naturally-generated anisotropy can dramatically
affect the transport of impurities in the compressing plasma, even in the
absence of scalar temperature or density gradients, by modifying the azimuthal
frictions that give rise to radial particle transport. Although the impurity
transport direction depends only on the sign of the pressure anisotropy, the
anisotropy itself depends on the pitch magnitude of the magnetic field and the
sign of the radial velocity. Thus, pressure anisotropy effects can drive
impurities either towards or away from the plasma core. These
anisotropy-dependent terms represent a qualitatively new effect, influencing
transport particularly in the sparse edge regions of dynamically-compressing

electron - phonon coupling constant, $\Omega_0$ is characteristic phonon
frequency, while $E_F$ is Fermi energy of electrons. Here we present an attempt
to describe electron - phonon interaction within Eliashberg - McMillan approach
in situation, when characteristic phonon frequency $\Omega_0$ becomes large
enough (comparable or exceeding the Fermi energy $E_F$). We consider the
general definition of electron - phonon pairing coupling constant $\lambda$,
taking into account the finite value of phonon frequency. Also we obtain the
simple expression for the generalized coupling constant $\tilde\lambda$, which
determines the mass renormalization, with the account of finite width of
conduction band, and describing the smooth transition from the adiabatic regime
to the region of strong nonadiabaticity. In the case of strong nonadiabaticity,
when $\Omega_0\gg E_F$, the new small parameter appears
$\lambda\frac{E_F}{\Omega_0}\sim\lambda\frac{D}{\Omega_0}\ll 1$ ($D$ is
conduction band half - width), and corrections to electronic spectrum become
irrelevant. At the same time, the temperature of superconducting transition
$T_c$ in antiadiabatic limit is still determined by Eliashberg - McMillan
coupling constant $\lambda$, while the preexponential factor in the expression
for $T_c$, conserving the form typical of weak - coupling theory, is determined
by the bandwidth (Fermi energy). For the case of interaction with a single
optical phonon we derive the single expression for $T_c$, valid both in
adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes and describing the continuous transition

second-order in time and space, relying upon a Finite Volume method for the
spatial discretization and a three-point backward Euler for the time
integration. In particular, the convective fluxes are computed by a multi-fluid

modified Rusanov scheme with tunable dissipation for the Maxwell equations.
Source terms are integrated with a one-point rule, using the cell-centered

the performance of two open source linear system solvers (i.e. PETSc,

demonstrated in two representative 2D benchmarks: propagation of circularly

setting, leading to apparent differences in the treatments used to model photon
pair sources, compared to those used to model degenerate down-conversion
processes. The Bloch-Messiah reduction of Gaussian processes to single-mode
squeezers and passive (linear) unitaries appears juxtaposed against the
practicalities of the Schmidt-decomposition for photon pair sources into
two-mode squeezers and passive unitaries. Here, we present a general framework
which unifies these forms as well as elucidating more general structure in
multimode Gaussian transformations. The decomposition is achieved by
introducing additional constraints into the Bloch-Messiah reduction used to
diagonalise Gaussian processes, these constraints motivated by physical
constraints following from the inequivalence of different physical degrees of
freedom in a system, ie. the temporal-spectral degrees of freedom vs different
spatial modes in a transformation. The result is the emergence of the two-mode
squeezing picture from the reduction, as well as the potential to generalise
these constraints to accommodate spectral imperfections in a source generating
3-mode continuous variable GHZ-like states. Furthermore, we consider the
practical scenario in which a transformation aims to generate a multiphoton
entangled state, whereby spatial modes provide desirable degrees of freedom,
whilst undesired spectral mode structure contributes noise, and show that this
spectral impurity can be efficiently modeled by finding an optimal low
dimensional bases for its simulation.

In this case, a well-stirred tank is partially drained, and subsequently
refilled using fresh medium when the concentration of both resources (assumed

process successful if the threshold for emptying/refilling the reactor can be
reached indefinitely without the time between successive emptying/refillings

  arXiv:1808.05132",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a previous work, those of the luminosity measurements of the pre-white
dwarf PG 1159-035 which are available online yielded estimates for the optimal
embedding dimension, for the dimensionality of the phase space reconstructed
from these observations, and for the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$: the
result $\lambda = (9.2 \pm 1.0 ({\rm stat.}) \pm 2.7 ({\rm syst.})) \cdot
10^{-2}~\Delta \tau^{-1}$ ($\Delta \tau=10$ s is the sampling interval in the
measurements) was obtained, suggesting that the physical processes, underlying
the variation of the luminosity of PG 1159-035, are chaotic. An improved
approach is employed in the present work in relation to the database of
embedding vectors: instead of assigning each of the input time-series arrays
either to the training or to the test set, the new approach features the
creation of a dynamical database, i.e., of one which depends on the choice of
the input test file. Although the size of the database is thus increased by a
factor of about $2$ (compared to the previous study), the impact of this change
on the important results is found to be insignificant. The estimate of this
work for the maximal Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda = (8.9 \pm 0.7 ({\rm stat.})
\pm 1.9 ({\rm syst.})) \cdot 10^{-2}~\Delta \tau^{-1}$) is in very good
agreement with the result of the earlier study.

dynamics directly resulting from control action are typical characteristics and
may show different behaviors between real faults and normal changes of
operating conditions. However, conventional distributed monitoring approaches
do not consider the closed-loop control mechanism and only explore static
characteristics, which thus are incapable of distinguishing between real
process faults and nominal changes of operating conditions, leading to
unnecessary alarms. In this regard, this paper proposes a distributed
monitoring method for closed-loop industrial processes by concurrently
exploring static and dynamic characteristics. First, the large-scale
closed-loop process is decomposed into several subsystems by developing a
sparse slow feature analysis (SSFA) algorithm which capture changes of both
static and dynamic information. Second, distributed models are developed to
separately capture static and dynamic characteristics from the local and global
aspects. Based on the distributed monitoring system, a two-level monitoring
strategy is proposed to check different influences on process characteristics
resulting from changes of the operating conditions and control action, and thus
the two changes can be well distinguished from each other. Case studies are
conducted based on both benchmark data and real industrial process data to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

significantly influence the dynamics of socio-economic systems. In addition, it
is necessary to evaluate not the probability of errors in each characteristic

for correlated games, however, enforces the players to obey the instructions
from a third party or ""correlation device"" to reach equilibrium, but this
cannot be achieved for all initial correlations. We extend here the existing
framework of correlated games and find that there are other interesting and
previously unknown Nash equilibria that make use of correlations to obtain the
best payoff. This is achieved by allowing the players the freedom to follow or
not to follow the suggestions of the correlation device. By assigning
independent probabilities to follow every possible suggestion, the players
engage in a response game that turns out to have a rich structure of Nash
equilibria that goes beyond the correlated equilibrium and mixed-strategy
solutions. We determine the Nash equilibria for all possible correlated
Snowdrift games, which we find to be describable by Ising Models in thermal

memory-side processing. Rather than transferring large amounts of data across
power-hungry, high-latency interconnects, the Emu Chick moves lightweight
thread contexts to near-memory cores before the beginning of each memory read.
The current prototype hardware uses FPGAs to implement cache-less ""Gossamer
cores for doing computational work and a stationary core to run basic operating
system functions and migrate threads between nodes. In this multi-node
characterization of the Emu Chick, we extend an earlier single-node
investigation (Hein, et al. AsHES 2018) of the the memory bandwidth
characteristics of the system through benchmarks like STREAM, pointer chasing,
and sparse matrix-vector multiplication. We compare the Emu Chick hardware to
architectural simulation and an Intel Xeon-based platform. Our results
demonstrate that for many basic operations the Emu Chick can use available
memory bandwidth more efficiently than a more traditional, cache-based
architecture although bandwidth usage suffers for computationally intensive
workloads like SpMV. Moreover, the Emu Chick provides stable, predictable
performance with up to 65% of the peak bandwidth utilization on a random-access
pointer chasing benchmark with weak locality.

  Preservation","ICDM 2018, Full Version",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph representation learning aims at transforming graph data into meaningful
low-dimensional vectors to facilitate the employment of machine learning and
data mining algorithms designed for general data. Most current graph
representation learning approaches are transductive, which means that they
require all the nodes in the graph are known when learning graph
representations and these approaches cannot naturally generalize to unseen
nodes. In this paper, we present a Fast Inductive Graph Representation Learning
framework (FI-GRL) to learn nodes' low-dimensional representations. Our
approach can obtain accurate representations for seen nodes with provable
theoretical guarantees and can easily generalize to unseen nodes. Specifically,
in order to explicitly decouple nodes' relations expressed by the graph, we
transform nodes into a randomized subspace spanned by a random projection
matrix. This stage is guaranteed to preserve the projection-cost of the
normalized random walk matrix which is highly related to the normalized cut of
the graph. Then feature extraction is achieved by conducting singular value
decomposition on the obtained matrix sketch. By leveraging the property of
projection-cost preservation on the matrix sketch, the obtained representation
result is nearly optimal. To deal with unseen nodes, we utilize folding-in
technique to learn their meaningful representations. Empirically, when the
amount of seen nodes are larger than that of unseen nodes, FI-GRL always
achieves excellent results. Our algorithm is fast, simple to implement and
theoretically guaranteed. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our algorithm on both efficacy and efficiency over both
macroscopic level (clustering) and microscopic level (structural hole
detection) applications.

A 98, 063802 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevA.98.063802",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The propagation of a light ray in thin layer (film) within geometrical optics
is considered. It is assumed that the ray is captured inside the layer due to
reflecting walls or total internal reflection (in the case of a dielectric
layer). It has been found that for a very thin film (the length scale is
imposed by the curvature of the surface at a given point) the equations
describing the trajectory of the light beam are reduced to the equation of a
geodesic on the limiting curved surface. There have also been found corrections
to the trajectory equation resulting from the finite thickness of the film.
Numerical calculations performed for a couple of exemplary curved layers (cone,
sphere, torus and catenoid) confirm that for thin layers the light ray which is
repeatedly reflected, propagates along the curve close to the geodesic but as
the layer thickness increases, these trajectories move away from each other.
Because the trajectory equations are complicated non-linear differential
equations, their solutions show some chaotic features. Small changes in the
initial conditions result in remarkably different trajectories. These chaotic
properties become less significant the thinner the layer under consideration.

yields a hysteretic behavior, and in particular its asymmetry, when performed
in the framework of an anisotropic effective medium approximation taking into
account the volume fraction of the metal inclusions as well as their shape. We
reveal microscopic details of the percolation transition, namely that the shape
of the metal inclusions goes through several plateaus, as seen in the evolution
of the shape factor on both sides of the transition region and resulting in
different critical volume fractions at the transition for the heating and
cooling cycles.

efficient, site-specific cooling technology for microprocessor hot spots using
Alternating Current Electrothermal Flow (ACET). ACET deploys an electrokinetic
transport mechanism without requiring any external prime mover and can be shown
to be highly effective in reducing hot spot temperatures below their allowable
limits. The proposed technique leverages the heat source(s) itself to drive the
fluid in the ACET cooling mechanism, thereby making this a highly energy
efficient active technique. Our parametric analyses present the optimal range
of fluid properties, viz. electrical conductivity where the cooling efficiency
is maximum. Further, the impact of geometrical parameters as well as input
voltages has been characterized. Our results show a reduction of hot spot
temperature by more than 30% for flow through a channel of 600 microns under
appropriate conditions at an applied AC voltage of 10-12 V. Comparison with
other micro-cooler technologies show the proposed technique to be more energy
efficient in its range of operation. These results establish the potential of
the ACET cooling and can open up a new avenue to be explored for thermal
management of miniaturized devices and systems.
