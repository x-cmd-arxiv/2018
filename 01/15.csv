relatively recent development in the LBM community, which has better numerical
stability and naturally achieves better Galilean invariance for a specified
lattice compared with the classical single-relation-time (SRT) LBM. Recently,
CLBM has been extended to simulate thermal flows based on the
double-distribution-function (DDF) approach [L. Fei \textit{et al.}, Int. J.
Heat Mass Transfer 120, 624 (2018)]. In this work, CLBM is further extended to
simulate thermal flows involving complex thermal boundary conditions and/or a
heat source. Particularly, a discrete source term in the central-moment space
is proposed to include a heat source, and a general bounce-back scheme is
employed to implement thermal boundary conditions. The numerical results for
several canonical problems are in good agreement with the analytical solutions
and/or numerical results in the literature, which verifies the present CLBM
implementation for thermal flows.

[Geier \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{63}, 066705 (2006)] possesses very
good numerical stability. However, two constraints exist in three-dimensional
(3D) CLBM simulations. Firstly, the conventional implementation for 3D CLBM
involves cumbersome operations and requires much higher computational cost
compared to the single-relaxation-time (SRT) LBM. Secondly, it is a challenge
to accurately incorporate a general force field into the 3D CLBM. In this
paper, we present an improved method to implement CLBM in 3D. The main strategy
is to adopt a simplified central moment set, and carry out the
central-moment-based collision operator based on a general
multi-relaxation-time (GMRT) framework. Next, the recently proposed consistent
forcing scheme in CLBM [L. Fei and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{96}, 053307
(2017)] is extended to incorporate a general force field into 3D CLBM. Compared
with the recently developed non-orthogonal CLBM [A. D. Rosis, Phys. Rev. E
\textbf{95}, 013310 (2017)], our implementation is proved to reduce the
computational cost significantly. The inconsistency of adopting the discrete
equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) in the non-orthogonal CLBM is
revealed and discussed. The 3D CLBM developed here in conjunction with the
consistent forcing scheme is verified through numerical simulations of several
canonical force-driven flows, highlighting very good properties in terms of
accuracy, convergence and consistency with the nonslip rule. Finally, the
techniques developed here for 3D CLBM can be applied to make the implementation
and execution of 3D MRT-LBM much more efficient.

address these limitations, we employ a Bayesian multi-parameter evidence
synthesis model to systematically combine multiple sources of data, account for
bias in certain data sources, and provide unbiased HCV prevalence estimates
with associated uncertainty. Our approach improves on previous estimates by
explicitly accounting for injecting drug use and including data from high-risk
subpopulations such as the incarcerated, and is more inclusive, utilizing ten
NYC data sources. In addition, we derive two new equations to allow age at
first injecting drug use data for former and current IDUs to be incorporated
into the Bayesian evidence synthesis, a first for this type of model. Our
estimated overall HCV prevalence as of 2012 among NYC adults aged 20-59 years
is 2.78% (95% CI 2.61-2.94%), which represents between 124,900 and 140,000
chronic HCV cases. These estimates suggest that HCV prevalence in NYC is higher
than previously indicated from household surveys (2.2%) and the surveillance
system (2.37%), and that HCV transmission is increasing among young injecting
adults in NYC. An ancillary benefit from our results is an estimate of current
IDUs aged 20-59 in NYC: 0.58% or 27,600 individuals.

fashion over the entire video, effectively treating the problem as a large
number of separate multi-frame super-resolution tasks. This approach has two

super-resolution framework that uses the previously inferred HR estimate to
super-resolve the subsequent frame. This naturally encourages temporally
consistent results and reduces the computational cost by warping only one image

the ability to assimilate a large number of previous frames without increased

of arithmetic potentialism. Specifically, I consider the natural potentialist
systems arising from the models of arithmetic under their natural extension
concepts, such as end-extensions, arbitrary extensions, conservative extensions
and more. In these potentialist systems, I show, the propositional modal
assertions that are valid with respect to all arithmetic assertions with
parameters are exactly the assertions of S4. With respect to sentences,
however, the validities of a model lie between S4 and S5, and these bounds are
sharp in that there are models realizing both endpoints. For a model of
arithmetic to validate S5 is precisely to fulfill the arithmetic maximality
principle, which asserts that every possibly necessary statement is already
true, and these models are equivalently characterized as those satisfying a
maximal $\Sigma_1$ theory. The main S4 analysis makes fundamental use of the
universal algorithm, of which this article provides a simplified,
self-contained account. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the
philosophical differences of several fundamentally different potentialist
attitudes---linear inevitability, convergent potentialism and radical branching
possibility---are expressed by their corresponding potentialist modal
validities.

highly complex process in which a set of rules and connections are formulated
at distinct scales. Previous efforts have shown that agent-based, multi-scale
modeling systems can integrate physical and biological rules and provide new
avenues to study developmental systems. However, the application of these
systems to model cell movement is still challenging and requires a
comprehensive understanding of regulation networks at the right scales. Recent
developments in deep learning and reinforcement learning provide an
unprecedented opportunity to explore cell movement using 3D time-lapse images.
We present a deep reinforcement learning approach within an ABM system to
characterize cell movement in C. elegans embryogenesis. Our modeling system
captures the complexity of cell movement patterns in the embryo and overcomes
the local optimization problem encountered by traditional rule-based, ABM that
uses greedy algorithms. We tested our model with two real developmental
processes: the anterior movement of the Cpaaa cell via intercalation and the
rearrangement of the left-right asymmetry. In the first case, model results
showed that Cpaaa's intercalation is an active directional cell movement caused
by the continuous effects from a longer distance, as opposed to a passive
movement caused by neighbor cell movements. This is because the learning-based
simulation found that a passive movement model could not lead Cpaaa to the
predefined destination. In the second case, a leader-follower mechanism well
explained the collective cell movement pattern. These results showed that our
approach to introduce deep reinforcement learning into ABM can test regulatory
mechanisms by exploring cell migration paths in a reverse engineering
perspective. This model opens new doors to explore large datasets generated by
live imaging.

improves polynomially on the $\Theta(n)$ quantum query complexity of the

devices and support third-party application development, currently use
permission models inspired by smartphone operating systems-they group
functionally similar device operations into separate units, and require users
to grant apps access to devices at that granularity. Unfortunately, this leads
to two issues: (1) apps that do not require access to all of the granted device
operations have overprivileged access to them, (2) apps might pose a higher
risk to users than needed because physical device operations are fundamentally
risk-asymmetric-""door.unlock"" provides access to burglars, and ""door.lock"" can

a system that leverages the risk-asymmetry in physical device operations to
limit the risk that apps pose to smart home users, without increasing the
user's decision overhead. Tyche introduces the notion of risk-based
permissions. When using risk-based permissions, device operations are grouped
into units of similar risk, and users grant apps access to devices at that
risk-based granularity. Starting from a set of permissions derived from the
popular Samsung SmartThings platform, we conduct a user study involving
domain-experts and Mechanical Turk users to compute a relative ranking of risks

of producing plausible images without copying large tiles of the exemplar. We
focus on a simple synthesis algorithm, where we explore two patch match
heuristics; the well known Bidirectional Similarity (BS) measure and a
heuristic that finds near permutations using the solution of an entropy
regularized optimal transport (OT) problem. Innovative synthesis is achieved
with a small patch size, where global plausibility relies on the qualities of
the match. For OT, less entropic regularization also meant near permutations
and more plausible images. We examine the tile maps of the synthesized images,
showing that they are indeed novel superpositions of the input and contain few
or no verbatim copies. Synthesis results are compared to a statistical method,
namely a random convolutional network. We conclude by remarking simple
algorithms using only the input image can synthesize textures decently well and
call for more modest approaches in future algorithm design.

contribution and low-density symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ constrained by
heavy-ion reaction data, we calculate the dimensionless tidal deformability
$\Lambda$ of neutron stars in coalescing binary systems. Corresponding to the
partially constrained EOS that previously predicted a radius of 11.5 km $\leq
R_{1.4} \leq$ 13.6 km for canonical neutron-star configurations, $\Lambda$ is
found to be in the range of 292 $\leq\Lambda_{1.4}\leq$ 680, consistent with
the very recent observation of the GW170817 event. We investigate the effect of
the high-density behavior of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ on the tidal properties of neutron
stars and find that while $\Lambda$ depends strongly on the details of the
symmetry energy, different trends of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ lead to very similar
values of $\Lambda$. In particular, the transition from stiff/soft to
soft/stiff $E_{sym}(\rho)$ could yield the same $\Lambda$. Thus, measuring
$\Lambda$ alone may not determine completely the density dependence of the
symmetry energy. Coherent analyses of the dense neutron-rich nuclear matter EOS
underlying both nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations
are therefore necessary to break this degeneracy and determine precisely the
details of the $E_{sym}(\rho)$.

  function in youth",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Executive function emerges late in development and displays different
developmental trends in males and females. Sex differences in executive
function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to psychopathology as well
as to behaviors that impinge on health. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these
differences is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that sex
differences in executive function in youth stem from sex differences in the
controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.
Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we
characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks
estimated from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample
of 882 youth aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these
networks by estimating average and modal controllability, two statistics that
probe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy-
versus difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal
controllability in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions while males have
higher average controllability in frontal and subcortical regions. Furthermore,
average controllability values in the medial frontal cortex and subcortex, both
higher in males, are negatively related to executive function. Finally, we find
that average controllability predicts sex-dependent individual differences in
activation during an n-back working memory task. Taken together, our findings
support the notion that sex differences in the controllability of structural
brain networks can partially explain sex differences in executive function.
Controllability of structural brain networks also predicts features of
task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for controllability to
represent context-specific constraints on network state more generally.

complex spatiotemporal processes of epidemic spreading can be reduced to

networks to physical propagation channels. Subsequently, we propose a novel
communications-inspired model of epidemic spreading and mitigation by
establishing the one-to-one correspondence between the essential components
comprising information and disease transmissions. The epidemic processes can be
regarded as macroscale molecular communications, in which individuals are
macroscale information molecules carrying messages (epidemiological states). We
then present the notions of normalized ensemble-average prevalence (NEAP) and
prevalence delay profile (PDP) to characterize the relative impact and time
difference of all the spreading paths, which are analogous to the classical
description methods of path loss and power delay profile in communications.
Furthermore, we introduce the metric of root mean square (RMS) delay spread to
measure the distortion of early contagion dynamics caused by multiple infection
transmission routes. In addition, we show how social and medical interventions
can be understood from the perspectives of various communication modules. The
proposed framework provides an intuitive, coherent, and efficient approach for
characterization of the disease outbreaks by applying the deep-rooted

information about the internal dynamics of galaxies. The skewness of LOSVDs
represents their asymmetric deviation from a Gaussian profile. Correlations
between the skewness parameter ($h_3$) and the mean velocity (\vm) of a
Gauss-Hermite series reflect the underlying stellar orbital configurations of
different morphological components. Using two self-consistent $N$-body
simulations of disk galaxies with different bar strengths, we investigate \hv\
correlations at different inclination angles. Similar to previous studies, we
find anticorrelations in the disk area, and positive correlations in the bar
area when viewed edge-on. However, at intermediate inclinations, the outer
parts of bars exhibit anticorrelations, while the core areas dominated by the
boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges still maintain weak positive correlations.
When viewed edge-on, particles in the foreground/background disk (the wing
region) in the bar area constitute the main velocity peak, whereas the
particles in the bar contribute to the high-velocity tail, generating the \hv\
correlation. If we remove the wing particles, the LOSVDs of the particles in
the outer part of the bar only exhibit a low-velocity tail, resulting in a
negative \hv\ correlation, whereas the core areas in the central region still
show weakly positive correlations. We discuss implications for IFU observations
on bars, and show that the variation of the \hv\ correlation in the disk galaxy
may be used as a kinematic indicator of the bar and the B/PS bulge.

the connection Laplacian L defined by L(x,y)=1 if x and y intersect and 0 else.
(I) As a consequence of the spectral formula chi(G)=sum_x (-1)^dim(x) =
p(G)-n(G), where p(G) is the number of positive eigenvalues and n(G) is the
number of negative eigenvalues of L, both the Euler characteristic
chi(G)=zeta(0)-2 i zeta'(0)/pi as well as determinant det(L)=e^zeta'(0)/pi can
be written in terms of zeta. (II) As a consequence of the generalized
Cauchy-Binet formula for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of
a product of matrices we show that for every one-dimensional simplicial complex
G, the functional equation zeta(s)=zeta(-s) holds, where zeta(s) is the Zeta
function of the positive definite squared connection operator L^2 of G.
Equivalently, the spectrum sigma of the integer matrix L^2 for a 1-dimensional
complex always satisfies the symmetry sigma = 1/sigma and the characteristic
polynomial of L^2 is palindromic. The functional equation extends to products
of one-dimensional complexes. (III) Explicit expressions for the spectrum of
circular connection Laplacian lead to an explicit entire zeta function in the
Barycentric limit. The situation is simpler than in the Hodge Laplacian H=D^2

case, the limiting zeta function is a generalized hypergeometric function which
for an integer s is given by an elliptic integral over the real elliptic curve
w^2=(1+z)(1-z)(z^2-4z-1), which has the analytic involutive symmetry (z,w) to

  Performance Estimation",,,"10.1016/j.jss.2018.01.010",,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Software engineers often have to estimate the performance of a software
system before having full knowledge of the system parameters, such as workload
and operational profile. These uncertain parameters inevitably affect the
accuracy of quality evaluations, and the ability to judge if the system can
continue to fulfil performance requirements if parameter results are different
from expected. Previous work has addressed this problem by modelling the
potential values of uncertain parameters as probability distribution functions,
and estimating the robustness of the system using Monte Carlo-based methods.
These approaches require a large number of samples, which results in high
computational cost and long waiting times.
  To address the computational inefficiency of existing approaches, we employ
Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) as a rigorous method for uncertainty
propagation and further extend its use to robust performance estimation. The
aim is to assess if the software system is robust, i.e., it can withstand
possible changes in parameter values, and continue to meet performance
requirements. PCE is a very efficient technique, and requires significantly
less computations to accurately estimate the distribution of performance
indices. Through three very different case studies from different phases of
software development and heterogeneous application domains, we show that PCE
can accurately (>97\%) estimate the robustness of various performance indices,
and saves up to 225 hours of performance evaluation time when compared to Monte

solvation. The solvophilic contribution is further parsed into a chemistry
contribution arising from solute interaction with the solvent in the first
solvation shell and a long-range contribution arising from non-specific
interactions between the solute and the solvent beyond the first solvation
shell. The cavity contribution is obtained for two different envelopes,
$\Sigma_{SE}$ which theory identifies as the solvent excluded volume and a
larger envelope ($\Sigma_G$) beyond which solute-solvent interactions are
Gaussian. For both envelopes, the cavity contribution in water is proportional
to the surface area of the envelope. The same does not hold for GdmCl(aq),
revealing limitations of using molecular area to assess solvation energetics,
especially in mixed solvents. The $\Sigma_G$-cavity contribution predicts that
GdmCl(aq) should favor the more compact state, contrary to the role of GdmCl in
unfolding proteins. The chemistry contribution attenuates this effect, but
still the net local (chemistry plus $\Sigma_G$-packing) contribution is
inadequate in capturing the role of GdmCl. With the inclusion of the long-range

a combination of initialization and training schemes, and look at network
accuracy, convergence, and the layer's learned filters to assess the
criticality of the layer. We apply this analysis across four data sets of
varying complexity. We find that the accuracy of the model does not depend on

compression by fine-tuning across the entire model; and, lastly, that Knowledge
Distillation can be used to hasten convergence of a compressed network, but

viewed as differential geometry structures. This approach has shown that the
geometry in the space of probability distributions that are parameterized by
their covariance matrix is linked to the fundamentals concepts of estimation
theory. In particular, prior work proposes a Riemannian metric - the distance
between the parameterized probability distributions - that is equivalent to the
Fisher Information Matrix, and helpful in obtaining the deterministic
Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Recent work in this framework has led to
establishing links with several practical applications. However, classical CRLB
is useful only for unbiased estimators and inaccurately predicts the mean
square error in low signal-to-noise (SNR) scenarios. In this paper, we propose
a general Riemannian metric that, at once, is used to obtain both Bayesian CRLB
and deterministic CRLB along with their vector parameter extensions. We also
extend our results to the Barankin bound, thereby enhancing their applicability
to low SNR situations.

  Trimmed Convolution",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Arithmetic coding is an essential class of coding techniques. One key issue
of arithmetic encoding method is to predict the probability of the current
coding symbol from its context, i.e., the preceding encoded symbols, which
usually can be executed by building a look-up table (LUT). However, the
complexity of LUT increases exponentially with the length of context. Thus,
such solutions are limited to modeling large context, which inevitably
restricts the compression performance. Several recent deep neural network-based
solutions have been developed to account for large context, but are still
costly in computation. The inefficiency of the existing methods are mainly
attributed to that probability prediction is performed independently for the
neighboring symbols, which actually can be efficiently conducted by shared
computation. To this end, we propose a trimmed convolutional network for
arithmetic encoding (TCAE) to model large context while maintaining
computational efficiency. As for trimmed convolution, the convolutional kernels
are specially trimmed to respect the compression order and context dependency
of the input symbols. Benefited from trimmed convolution, the probability
prediction of all symbols can be efficiently performed in one single forward
pass via a fully convolutional network. Furthermore, to speed up the decoding
process, a slope TCAE model is presented to divide the codes from a 3D code map
into several blocks and remove the dependency between the codes inner one block
for parallel decoding, which can 60x speed up the decoding process. Experiments
show that our TCAE and slope TCAE attain better compression ratio in lossless
gray image compression, and can be adopted in CNN-based lossy image compression
to achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance with real-time encoding
speed.

fields ranging from quantum information and precision sensing to fundamental
tests of quantum mechanics. A central development that followed the advent of
single photon sources was the observation of the Hong-Ou- Mandel (HOM) effect,
a novel two-photon path interference phenomenon experienced by
indistinguishable photons. The effect is now a central technique in the field
of quantum optics, harnessed for a variety of applications such as diagnosing
single photon sources and creating probabilistic entanglement in linear quantum
computing. Recently, several distinct experiments using atomic sources have
realized the requisite control to observe and exploit Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference of atoms. This article provides a summary of this phenomenon and
discusses some of its implications for atomic systems. Transitioning from the
domain of photons to atoms opens new perspectives on fundamental concepts, such
as the classification of entanglement of identical particles. It aids in the
design of novel probes of quantities such as entanglement entropy by combining
well established tools of AMO physics - unity single-atom detection, tunable
interactions, and scalability - with the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.
Furthermore, it is now possible for established protocols in the photon
community, such as measurement-induced entanglement, to be employed in atomic
experiments that possess deterministic single-particle production and
detection. Hence, the realization of the HOM effect with atoms represents a
productive union of central ideas in quantum control of atoms and photons.

covariant approach is very powerful to pick out the perturbative variables

similar results can be derived, as expected. In addition, some other
interesting perturbations are also identified to be conformal invariant, such

  In the paper we analyze a potential to reduce upper bounds for graviton mass
with future observational data on trajectories of bright stars near the
Galactic Center. Since gravitational potentials are different for these two
cases, expressions for relativistic advance for general relativity and Yukawa
potential are different functions on eccentricity and semimajor axis, it gives
an opportunity to improve current estimates of graviton mass with future
observational facilities. In our considerations of an improvement potential for
a graviton mass estimate we adopt a conservative strategy and assume that
trajectories of bright stars and their apocenter advance will be described with
general relativity expressions and it gives opportunities to improve graviton
mass constraints. In contrast with our previous studies, where we present
current constraints on parameters of Yukawa gravity (Borka et al., 2013) and
graviton mass (Zakharov et al., 2016) from observations of S2 star, in the
paper we express expectations to improve current constraints for graviton mass,
assuming the GR predictions about apocenter shifts will be confirmed with
future observations. We concluded that if future observations of bright star
orbits during around fifty years will confirm GR predictions about apocenter
shifts of bright star orbits it give an opportunity to constrain a graviton
mass at a level around $5 \times 10^{-23}$ eV or slightly better than current
estimates obtained with LIGO observations.

large N, the optimal stroke is a traveling wave of bending, modulo edge
effects. If the number of shape variables is small, we can consider the same

attainable with small variations of the joint angles. The fully nonlinear
optimal control problem is solved numerically for the cases N=3 (Purcell's

states can spectrally overlap with the bulk continuum without hybridization,
and leakage into the bulk states is suppressed due to the PT symmetry. Two
exemplary PT symmetric systems, based on valley and quantum hall topological
phases, are investigated, and the connection with the corresponding Hermitian
systems is established. We find that the edge states smoothly transit to the
valley edge states found in Hermitian systems if the magnitude of gain/loss
vanishes. The topological nature of the PT edge states can be established
within the non-Hermitian Haldane model, where the topological invariance is
found to be unaffected by gain or loss. Nonreciprocal PT edge states are
discovered at the interfaces between PT-Haldane phases, indicating the
interplay between the gain/loss and the magnetic flux. The proposed systems are

Vulnerability to such ""adversarial attacks"", or ""adversarial examples"", has
been conjectured to be due to the excessive linearity of deep networks. In this
paper, we study this phenomenon in the setting of a linear classifier, and show
that it is possible to exploit sparsity in natural data to combat
$\ell_{\infty}$-bounded adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we demonstrate
the efficacy of a sparsifying front end via an ensemble averaged analysis, and
experimental results for the MNIST handwritten digit database. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to show that sparsity provides a
theoretically rigorous framework for defense against adversarial attacks.

prevent a full observation of distribution grids with direct measurements.
First approaches using a limited number of measurements to monitor such grids
exist, some of which use artificial neural networks (ANN). The current
ANN-based approaches, however, are limited to static topologies, only estimate
voltage magnitudes, do not work properly when confronted with a high amount of
distributed generation and often yield inaccurate results. These strong
limitations have prevented a true applicability of ANN for distribution grid
monitoring. The objective of this paper is to overcome the limitations of
existing approaches. We do that by presenting an ANN-based scheme, which
advances the state-of-the-art in several ways: Our scheme can cope with a very
low number of measurements, far less than is traditionally required by the
state-of-the-art weighted least squares state estimation (WLS SE). It can
estimate both voltage magnitudes and line loadings with high precision and
includes different switching states as inputs. Our contribution consists of a
method to generate useful training data by using a scenario generator and a
number of hyperparameters that define the ANN architecture. Both can be used
for different grids even with a high amount of distributed generation.
Simulations are performed with an elaborate evaluation approach on a real
distribution grid and a CIGRE benchmark grid both with a high amount of
distributed generation from photovoltaics and wind energy converters. They
demonstrate that the proposed ANN scheme clearly outperforms state-of-the-art
ANN schemes and WLS SE under normal operating conditions and different
situations such as gross measurement errors when comparing voltage magnitude

the sum of two separate contributions. One involves aspects of the non-Abelian
character of Quantum Chromodynamics that are expressed in the strong running
coupling and generate tight, dynamical color-antitriplet quark-quark
correlations in the scalar-isoscalar and pseudovector-isotriplet channels. This
attraction is magnified by quark exchange associated with diquark breakup and
reformation, which is required in order to ensure that each valence-quark
participates in all diquark correlations to the complete extent allowed by its
quantum numbers. Combining these effects, we arrive at a properly
antisymmetrised Faddeev wave function for the nucleon and calculate, e.g. the
flavor-separated versions of the Dirac and Pauli form factors and the proton's
leading-twist parton distribution amplitude. We conclude that available data
and planned experiments are capable of validating the proposed picture.

linear algebra problems. Nevertheless, classic Krylov subspace algorithms do
not scale well on massively parallel hardware due to synchronization
bottlenecks. Communication-hiding pipelined Krylov subspace methods offer
increased parallel scalability by overlapping the time-consuming global
communication phase with computations such as spmvs, hence reducing the impact
of the global synchronization and avoiding processor idling. One of the first
published methods in this class is the pipelined Conjugate Gradient method
(p-CG). However, on large numbers of processors the communication phase may
take much longer than the computation of a single spmv. This work extends the
pipelined CG method to deeper pipelines, denoted as p(l)-CG, which allows
further scaling when the global communication phase is the dominant
time-consuming factor. By overlapping the global all-to-all reduction phase in
each CG iteration with the next l spmvs (deep pipelining), the method hides
communication latency behind additional computational work. The p(l)-CG
algorithm is derived from similar principles as the existing p(l)-GMRES method
and by exploiting operator symmetry. The p(l)-CG method is also compared to
other Krylov subspace methods, including the closely related classic CG and
D-Lanczos methods and the pipelined CG method by Ghysels et al.. By analyzing
the maximal accuracy attainable by the p(l)-CG method it is shown that the
pipelining technique induces a trade-off between performance and numerical
stability. A preconditioned version of the algorithm is also proposed and
storage requirements and performance estimates are discussed. Experimental
results demonstrate the possible performance gains and the attainable accuracy
of deeper pipelined CG for solving large scale symmetric linear systems.

requirements which drove the described technological developments. In the first
phase of the project standard redistribution technologies from wafer level
packaging were adapted to enable a high density reticle-to-reticle routing on
200mm CMOS wafers. Neighboring reticles were interconnected across the scribe
lines with an 8{\mu}m pitch routing based on semi-additive copper
metallization. Passivation by photo sensitive benzocyclobutene was used to
enable a second intra-reticle routing layer. Final IO pads with flash gold were
generated on top of each reticle. With that concept neuromorphic systems based
on full wafers could be assembled and tested. The fabricated high density

to allow an upscaling of the system size to a large number of wafers with
feasible effort a full wafer embedding concept for printed circuit boards was
developed and proven in the second phase of the project. The wafers were
thinned to 250{\mu}m and laminated with additional prepreg layers and copper
foils into a core material. After lamination of the PCB panel the reticle IOs

electroplating, lithography and subtractive etching of the PCB wiring

the lab, of rate $R_f$. We prove that the number of tests required for both
correct reconstruction at the legitimate lab, with high probability, and
negligible mutual information at the eavesdropper is $1/min\{1,1-\delta+R_f\}$
times the number of tests required with no secrecy constraint. Thus, unlike
non-secure GT, where an adaptive algorithm has only a mild impact, under a
security constraint it can significantly boost performance. A key insight is
that not only the adaptive link should disregard the actual test results and
simply send keys, these keys should be enhanced through a ""secret sharing""
scheme before usage. We drive sufficiency and necessity bounds that completely
characterizes the Secure Adaptive GT capacity.

transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 carried out in mid-2017 with
Kepler in the K2 configuration, when an X-ray subluminous accretion disk was
present in the binary. Flares lasting from minutes to 14 hr were observed for
15.6% of the time, which is a larger fraction than previously reported on the
basis of X-ray and past optical observations, and more frequently when the
companion was at the superior conjunction of the orbit. A sinusoidal modulation
at the binary orbital period was also present with an amplitude of ~16%, which
varied by a few percent over timescales of days, and with a maximum that took
place 890 +/- 85 s earlier than the superior conjunction of the donor. We
interpret these phenomena in terms of reprocessing of the X-ray emission by an
asymmetrically heated companion star surface and/or a non-axisymmetric outflow
possibly launched close to the inner Lagrangian point. Furthermore, the
non-flaring average emission varied by up to ~ 40% over a time scale of days in
the absence of correspondingly large variations of the irradiating X-ray flux.
The latter suggests that the observed changes in the average optical luminosity
might be due to variations of the geometry, size, and/or mass accretion rate in
the outer regions of the accretion disk.

Nowadays it is often necessary to investigate, with great accuracy, a huge set
of parameters, in order to explore interesting features.
  In literature, it is well known that two-dimensional particle in cell (2D
PIC) simulations can only give a qualitative estimation of experimental
results, often through a great layer of arbitrariness. On the other hand,
three-dimensional (3D) PIC simulations, for the same setup, can typically
require two orders of magnitude more of computational resources, to deliver
results that, while being similar to laboratory results, are still far from
being a real match, due to the many uncertainties, in the parameters and in the
model, included in the physical engine.
  Following our recent published work, we discuss here a couple of empirical
laws that we proposed, that can help giving quantitative insight into 2D PIC
simulations and determining when 3D simulations should be stopped, if it is not
really necessary to do a detailed exploration of the numerical results at long

a spectral index that is, in most cases, different from the simple leaky-box

attached with many sensors having ability to measure the environmental
information. Spatial correlation between nodes exists in such wireless sensor
network based on common sensory coverage and then the redundant data
communication is observed. To study virus spreading dynamics in such scenario,
a modified SI epidemic model is derived mathematically by incorporating WSN
parameters such as spatial correlation, node density, sensing range,
transmission range, total sensor nodes etc. The solution for proposed SI model
is also determined to study the dynamics with time. Initially, a small number
of nodes are attacked by viruses and then virus infection propagates through
its neighboring nodes over normal data communication. Since redundant nodes
exists in correlated sensor field, virus spread process could be different with
different sensory coverage. The proposed SI model captures spatial and temporal

network failure. By exploiting spatial correlation between nodes, spread
control scheme is developed to limit the further infection in the network.

strategy for efficient RDH in this paper, in which the raw host could be

  2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random geometric graphs (RGGs) are commonly used to model networked systems
that depend on the underlying spatial embedding. We concern ourselves with the
probability distribution of an RGG, which is crucial for studying its random
topology, properties (e.g., connectedness), or Shannon entropy as a measure of
the graph's topological uncertainty (or information content). Moreover, the
distribution is also relevant for determining average network performance or
designing protocols. However, a major impediment in deducing the graph
distribution is that it requires the joint probability distribution of the
$n(n-1)/2$ distances between $n$ nodes randomly distributed in a bounded
domain. As no such result exists in the literature, we make progress by
obtaining the joint distribution of the distances between three nodes confined
in a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This enables the calculation of the probability
distribution and entropy of a three-node graph. For arbitrary $n$, we derive a
series of upper bounds on the graph entropy; in particular, the bound involving
the entropy of a three-node graph is tighter than the existing bound which
assumes distances are independent. Finally, we provide numerical results on
graph connectedness and the tightness of the derived entropy bounds.

bulk and surface micromachining technology. A micro mirror designed as an
oscillatory MEMS constitutes a prominent example. Typically, in order to
minimize energy consumption, the micro mirror is designed to have high quality
factors. In addition, a phase-locked loop guarantees resonant actuation despite
the occurrence of frequency shifts. In these cases, the oscillation amplitude
of the micro mirror is expected to scale linearly with the actuation input
power. Here, however, we report on an experimental observation which clearly
shows an amplitude depletion that is not in accordance with any linear
behaviour. As a consequence, the actuation forces needed to reach the desired
oscillation amplitude are by multiples higher than expected. We are able to
explain the experimental observations accurately by introducing a single
degree-of-freedom model including an amplitude-dependent nonlinear damping
term. Remarkably, we find that the nonlinear damping shows a clear gas pressure
dependency. We investigate the concepts and compare our findings on two
different micro mirror design layouts.

varieties is intimately related to fascinating questions of geometry and number
theory -- especially through the concepts of curvature and positivity which are
central themes in Kodaira's contributions to mathematics. The aim of these
lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the
problem. The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every
projective variety $X$ of general type over~${\mathbb C}$, there exists a
proper algebraic subvariety $Y$ of $X$ containing all non constant entire
curves $f:{\mathbb C}\to X$. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet
bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case $X$ satisfies a strong
general type condition that is related to a certain jet-semistability property
of the tangent bundle $T\_X$. It is possible to exploit similar techniques to
investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970), according to
which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension $n$ and of sufficiently
large degree $d\ge d\_n$ in the complex projective space $\bP^{n+1}$ is
hyperbolic: in the early 2000's, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in
2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted vector fields on jet spaces,
combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture has been
settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of
Wronskian differential operators and associated multiplier ideals; shortly
afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could be modified to yield an explicit
value of $d\_n$. We give here a short proof based on a drastic simplification
of their ideas, along with a further improvement of Deng's bound, namely
$d\_n=\lfloor\frac{1}{5}(en)^{2n+2}\rfloor$.

system, two high-performance schemes of transmit antenna selection (TAS),
leakage-based and maximum secrecy rate (Max-SR), are proposed and a generalized
Euclidean distance-optimized antenna selection (EDAS) method is designed. From
simulation results and analysis, the four TAS schemes have an decreasing order:
Max-SR, leakage-based, generalized EDAS, and random (conventional), in terms of
SR performance. However, the proposed Max-SR method requires the exhaustive
search to achieve the optimal SR performance, thus its complexity is extremely
high as the number of antennas tends to medium and large scale. The proposed
leakage-based method approaches the Max-SR method with much lower complexity.
Thus, it achieves a good balance between complexity and SR performance. In
terms of bit error rate (BER), their performances are in an increasing order:
random, leakage-based, Max-SR, and generalized EDAS.

always had in Chemistry and the important role they have played, Bohmian
mechanics has been increasingly accepted within this community, particularly in
those areas of the theoretical chemistry based on quantum mechanics, e.g.,
quantum chemistry, chemical physics, or physical chemistry. From a historical
perspective, this evolution is remarkably interesting, particularly when the
scarce applications of Madelung's former hydrodynamical formulation, dating
back to the late 1960s and the 1970s, are compared with the many different
applications available at present. As also happens with classical
methodologies, Bohmian trajectories are essentially used to described and
analyze the evolution of chemical systems, to design and implement new
computational propagation techniques, or a combination of both. In the first
case, Bohmian trajectories have the advantage that they avoid invoking typical
quantum-classical correspondence to interpret the corresponding phenomenon or
process, while in the second case quantum-mechanical effects appear by
themselves, without the necessity to include artificially quantization
conditions. Rather than providing an exhaustive revision and analysis of all
these applications (excellent monographs on the issue are available in the
literature for the interested reader, which can be consulted in the

may serve the reader to acquire a general view (or impression) on how Bohmian
mechanics has permeated the different traditional levels or pathways to
approach molecular systems in Chemistry: electronic structure, molecular
dynamics and statistical mechanics. This is done with the aid of some
illustrative examples -- theoretical developments in some cases and numerical

chosen uniformly at random, then $\exp(O(\log^{1/3} n))$ traces suffice to

temperature. The state is pure at zero temperature and is mixed at finite
temperature. In the case of a single-electron injection, such a transformation
can be detected as a decrease in shot noise with increasing temperature. In the
case of a multi-electron injection, the situation is more subtle. The mixedness
helps the development of quantum-mechanical exchange correlations between
injected electrons, even if such correlations are absent at zero temperature.
These correlations enhance the shot noise, what in part counteracts the
reduction of noise with temperature. Moreover, at sufficiently high
temperatures, the correlation contribution to noise predominates over the
contribution of individual particles. As a result, in the system of $N$
electrons, the apparent charge (which is revealed via the shot noise) is
changed from $e$ at zero temperature to $Ne$ at high temperatures. It looks
like the exchange correlations glue up electrons into one particle of total
charge and energy. This point of view is supported by both charge noise and
heat noise. Interestingly, in the macroscopic limit, $N\to \infty$, the
correlation contribution completely suppresses the effect of temperature on
noise.

emissivity index beta close to 2. We derive the relative amount of the
different dust grains in the model, the total dust mass, and the strength of
the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) heating the dust at each spatial
location. The relative abundance of very small grains tends to increase, and
for big grains to decrease, at high values of Halpha luminosity. This shows
that the dust grains are modified inside the star-forming regions, in agreement
with a theoretical framework of dust evolution under different physical
conditions. The radial dependence of the GDR is consistent with the shallow
metallicity gradient observed in this galaxy. The strength of the ISRF derived
in our model correlates with the star formation rate in the galaxy in a pixel
by pixel basis. Although this is expected it is the first time that a
correlation between both quantities is reported. We produce a map of
submillimetre excess in the 500 microns SPIRE band for the disc of M33. The

the total luminosity at the mass accretion rates above $10^{21}\,{\rm

The trend is
to offload greedy computations on hardware accelerators as GPU, Xeon Phi or

energy-efficiency of specialized hardware and appear as a natural solution.
Hardware compilers from high-level languages (High-level synthesis, HLS) are
required to exploit all the capabilities of FPGA while satisfying tight
time-to-market constraints. Compiler optimizations for parallelism and data
locality restructure deeply the execution order of the processes, hence the
read/write patterns in communication channels. This breaks most FIFO channels,
which have to be implemented with addressable buffers. Expensive hardware is
required to enforce synchronizations, which often results in dramatic
performance loss. In this paper, we present an algorithm to partition the
communications so that most FIFO channels can be recovered after a loop tiling,
a key optimization for parallelism and data locality. Experimental results show
a drastic improvement of FIFO detection for regular kernels at the cost of a
few additional storage. As a bonus, the storage can even be reduced in some
cases.

Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 1961, necessitated the use of vancomycin ""the

already started gaining resistances to vancomycin. Liposome encapsulation of

vancomycin on MRSA and evaluated the antibacterial activity of the
liposome-entrapped drug in comparison to that of the free drug based on the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug. The MIC for liposomal
vancomycin was found to be about half of that of free vancomycin. The growth
response of MRSA showed that the liposomal vancomycin induced the culture to go
into bacteriostatic state and phagocytic killing was enhanced. Administration
of the antibiotic encapsulated in liposome thus was shown to greatly improve
the drug delivery as well as the drug resistance caused by MRSA.

were pre-incubated with different concentrations of pharmacological inhibitors
and then exposed to SPIONs for a few hours. The endocytosed particles were
localized and quantitatively estimated using Perl's or Prussian Blue reaction.
There was significant reduction in the uptake of SPIONs when incubated with the

reduction in SPION uptake was found to be dependent on the concentration of the

Results on the rates of observed neutron captures and nuclear recoils are

Also presented is the first statistically significant measurement of the

was obtained by unfolding the nuclear recoil spectrum. The observed neutron
spectrum is harder than predicted by GEANT4. An investigation of the
distribution of the time difference between muon tags and nuclear recoil

cannot properly describe the time distribution of nuclear recoil events. In
general, the description of the data is worse for GEANT4-10.3 than for

pathway for methanol to co-desorb at low temperatures. Mixed
CH$_{3}$OH:CO/CH$_{4}$ ices were heated under UHV (ultra-high vacuum)
conditions and ice contents are traced using RAIRS (reflection absorption IR
spectroscopy), while desorbing species were detected mass spectrometrically. An
updated gas-grain chemical network was used to test the impact of the results
of these experiments. The physical model used is applicable for TW Hya, a
protoplanetary disk in which cold gas-phase methanol has recently been
detected. Methanol release together with thermal CO desorption is found to be
an ineffective process in the experiments, resulting in an upper limit of
$\leq$ 7.3 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ CH3OH molecules per CO molecule over all ice
mixtures considered. Chemical modelling based on the upper limits shows that
co-desorption rates as low as 10$^{-6}$ CH$_{3}$OH molecules per CO molecule
are high enough to release substantial amounts of methanol to the gas-phase at
and around the location of the CO thermal desorption front in a protoplanetary
disk. The impact of thermal co-desorption of CH3OH with CO as a grain-gas
bridge mechanism is compared with that of UV induced photodesorption and
chemisorption.

open-circuit voltage is found to be ~ 2.3 V for the battery using the LTO@SPCT

accuracy for collision avoidance and have led to satellite collisions already.
This paper presents a methodology to predict RSOs' trajectories with higher
accuracy than that of the current methods. Inspired by the machine learning
(ML) theory through which the models are learned based on large amounts of
observed data and the prediction is conducted without explicitly modeling space
objects and space environment, the proposed ML approach integrates
physics-based orbit prediction algorithms with a learning-based process that
focuses on reducing the prediction errors. Using a simulation-based space
catalog environment as the test bed, the paper demonstrates three types of
generalization capability for the proposed ML approach: 1) the ML model can be
used to improve the same RSO's orbit information that is not available during
the learning process but shares the same time interval as the training data; 2)
the ML model can be used to improve predictions of the same RSO at future
epochs; and 3) the ML model based on a RSO can be applied to other RSOs that
share some common features.

cavities have been studied extensively over the years. In this paper we
introduce the fast encapsulating domain decomposition (EDD) scheme for the
analysis of radar cross section (RCS) of such open-ended cavities. Problem
definition, key principles, analysis, and implementation of the proposed
solution scheme are presented in detail. The EDD advantages stem from domain
decomposition along the elongated dimension and representing the fields on the
cross-sections in the spectral domain, which enables us to separate the fields
into in- and out-going waves. This diagonolizes the translation between the
cross sections, thus reducing the per segment computational complexity from
$O((N^A)^3)$ to $O(N^W(N^A)^2)$, where $N^A$ is the number of aperture unknowns
and $N^W$ is the number of wall unknowns per segment, satisfying $N^W<<N^A$,
since we construct the segmentation step to be small compared to the cross
section. The results of the EDD are demonstrated on an S-shape elongated
open-ended cavity.

by an exceptionally large time-integrated bolometric luminosity, a sustained
blue optical color, and Doppler-broadened HI lines at all times. Here, I
investigate the effect that a magnetar (initial rotational energy of 4x10^50erg
and field strength of 7x10^13G) would have on the properties of a typical Type
II SN ejecta (mass of 13.35Msun, kinetic energy of 1.32x10^51erg, 0.077Msun of
56Ni) produced by the terminal explosion of an H-rich blue-supergiant star. I
present a non-LTE time-dependent radiative transfer simulation of the resulting
photometric and spectroscopic evolution from 1d until 600d after explosion.
With magnetar power, the model luminosity and brightness are enhanced, the
ejecta is everywhere hotter and more ionised, and the spectrum formation region
is much more extended. This magnetar-powered SN ejecta reproduces most of the
observed properties of SLSN iPTF14hls, including the sustained brightness of
-18mag in the R band, the blue optical color, and the broad HI lines for 600d.
The non-extreme magnetar properties, combined with the standard Type II SN
ejecta properties offer an interesting alternative to the pair-unstable
super-massive star model recently proposed, which involves a highly-energetic
and super-massive ejecta. Hence, such Type II SLSNe may differ from standard
Type II SNe exclusively through the influence of a magnetar.

dilaton potentials, one can construct charged dilaton black holes in an
(anti)-de Sitter [(A)dS] spaces in the presence of linear Maxwell field.
However, asymptotically (A)dS dilaton black holes coupled to nonlinear gauge
field have not been found. In this paper, we construct, for the first time,
three new classes of dilaton black hole solutions in the presence of three
types of nonlinear electrodynamics, namely Born-Infeld, Logarithmic and
Exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. All these solutions are asymptotically
(A)dS and in the linear regime reduce to the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black
holes in AdS spaces. We investigate physical properties and the causal
structure, as well as asymptotic behavior of the obtained solutions, and show
that depending on the values of the metric parameters, the singularity can be
covered by various horizons. Interestingly enough, we find that the coupling of
dilaton field and nonlinear gauge field in the background of (A)dS spaces leads
to a strange behaviour for the electric field. We observe that the electric
field is zero at singularity and increases smoothly until reaches a maximum
value, then it decreases smoothly until goes to zero as $r\rightarrow\infty$.
The maximum value of the electric field increases with increasing the nonlinear
parameter $\beta$ or decreasing the dilaton coupling $\alpha$ and is shifted to
the singularity in the absence of either dilaton field ($\alpha=0$) or
nonlinear gauge field ($\beta\rightarrow\infty$).

ordinary or partial differential equations. From the point of view of analog
computability, the existence of an effective way to obtain solutions of these
systems is essential. A pioneering model of analog computation is the General
Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Shannon as a model of the
Differential Analyzer and improved by Pour-El, Lipshitz and Rubel, Costa and
Gra\c{c}a and others. Its power is known to be characterized by the class of
differentially algebraic functions, which includes the solutions of initial
value problems for ordinary differential equations. We address one of the
limitations of this model, concerning the notion of approximability, a
desirable property in computation over continuous spaces that is however absent
in the GPAC. In particular, the Shannon GPAC cannot be used to generate
non-differentially algebraic functions which can be approximately computed in
other models of computation. We extend the class of data types using networks
with channels which carry information on a general complete metric space $X$;
for example $X=C(R,R)$, the class of continuous functions of one real (spatial)
variable. We consider the original modules in Shannon's construction
(constants, adders, multipliers, integrators) and we add \emph{(continuous or
discrete) limit} modules which have one input and one output. We then define an
L-GPAC to be a network built with $X$-stream channels and the above-mentioned
modules. This leads us to a framework in which the specifications of such
analog systems are given by fixed points of certain operators on continuous
data streams. We study these analog systems and their associated operators, and
show how some classically non-generable functions, such as the gamma function
and the zeta function, can be captured with the L-GPAC.

Purcell factor, and effective volume of elastic modes. To illustrate our
framework, we consider the example of a submicron gold sphere as a generic
elastic GHz antenna and find that shear and mixed modes of low orders in such
