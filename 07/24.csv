evaluated point-wise is a challenging task that arises in statistical analysis,
notably in Bayesian inference for models with intractable likelihood functions.
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been proposed for this setting,
such as the pseudo-marginal method for latent variable models and the exchange
algorithm for a class of undirected graphical models. As with any MCMC
algorithm, the resulting estimators are justified asymptotically in the limit
of the number of iterations, but exhibit a bias for any fixed number of
iterations due to the Markov chains starting outside of stationarity. This
""burn-in"" bias is known to complicate the use of parallel processors for MCMC
computations. We show how to use coupling techniques to generate unbiased
estimators in finite time, building on recent advances for generic MCMC
algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of some of these procedures
by extending existing results to cover the case of polynomially ergodic Markov
chains. The efficiency of the proposed estimators is compared with that of
standard MCMC estimators, with theoretical arguments and numerical experiments
including state space models and Ising models.

facilitate the breathing and reduce the possibility of airway blocking by
lowering the surface tension when the lung volume decreases during exhalation.
This function is due to the dynamic surface tension of pulmonary surfactants,
which depends on the concentration of surfactants spread on the liquid layer
lining the interior surface of the airways and alveoli. Here, a finite membrane
element formulation for liquids is introduced that allows for the dynamics of
concentration-dependent surface tension, as is the particular case for

allows the presented framework to be easily used for drop shape analysis. It is
further shown how line tension can be taken into account. Following an
isogeometric approach, NURBS-based finite elements are used for the

the simulation of liquid films, constrained and unconstrained sessile drops,

problems of complexity or feasibility of manufacture, especially high line

semantics and their use lies at the heart of the theory of abstract
interpretation. Yet, mechanization of Galois connections using proof assistants
remains limited to restricted modes of use, preventing their general
application in mechanized metatheory and certified programming.
  This paper presents constructive Galois connections, a variant of Galois
connections that is effective both on paper and in proof assistants; is
complete with respect to a large subset of classical Galois connections; and
enables more general reasoning principles, including the ""calculational"" style
advocated by Cousot.
  To design constructive Galois connections we identify a restricted mode of
use of classical ones which is both general and amenable to mechanization in
dependently-typed functional programming languages. Crucial to our metatheory
is the addition of monadic structure to Galois connections to control a
""specification effect."" Effectful calculations may reason classically, while
pure calculations have extractable computational content. Explicitly moving
between the worlds of specification and implementation is enabled by our
metatheory.
  To validate our approach, we provide two case studies in mechanizing existing
proofs from the literature: the first uses calculational abstract
interpretation to design a static analyzer; the second forms a semantic basis
for gradual typing. Both mechanized proofs closely follow their original
paper-and-pencil counterparts, employ reasoning principles not captured by
previous mechanization approaches, support the extraction of verified
algorithms, and are novel.

economy, with the Smart Grid becoming an increasingly important factor in power
generation and distribution. In order to fully exploit it advantages, the
analysis of modern Smart Grid requires close collaboration and convergence
between power engineers and signal processing and machine learning experts.
Current analysis techniques are typically derived from a Circuit Theory
perspective; such an approach is adequate for only fully balanced systems
operating at nominal conditions and non-obvious for data scientists - this is
prohibitive for the analysis of dynamically unbalanced smart grids, where Data
Analytics is not only well suited but also necessary. A common language that
bridges the gap between Circuit Theory and Data Analytics, and the respective
community of experts, would be a natural step forward. To this end, we revisit
the Clarke and related transforms from a subspace, latent component, and
spatial frequency analysis frameworks, to establish fundamental relationships
between the standard three-phase transforms and modern Data Analytics. We show
that the Clarke transform admits a physical interpretation as a ""spatial
dimensionality"" reduction technique which is equivalent to Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for balanced systems, but is sub-optimal for dynamically
unbalanced systems, such as the Smart Grid, while the related Park transform
performs further ""temporal"" dimensionality reduction. Such a perspective opens
numerous new avenues for the use Signal Processing and Machine Learning in
power grid research, and paves the way for innovative optimisation,
transformation, and analysis techniques that are not accessible to arrive at
from the standard Circuit Theory principles, as demonstrated in this work
through the possibility of simultaneous frequency estimation and fault

entangled stabilizer states using only single-qubit measurements, known as
\emph{stabilizer pathfinding} (SPF). For heralded loss, SPF is shown to
generate optimally loss-tolerant measurement patterns on any given stabilizer
state. Furthermore, SPF also provides highly loss-tolerant teleportation
strategies when qubit loss is unheralded. We provide a fast algorithm for SPF
that updates continuously as a state is generated and measured, which is
therefore suitable for real-time implementation on a quantum-computing device.
When compared to simulations of previous heuristics for loss-tolerant
teleportation on graph states, SPF provides considerable gains in tolerance to
both heralded and unheralded loss, achieving a near-perfect teleportation rate
($> 95\%$) in the regime of low qubit loss ($< 10\%$) on various graph state
lattices. Using these results we also present evidence that points towards the
existence of loss-tolerant thresholds on such states, which in turn indicates
that the loss-tolerant behaviour we have found also applies as the number of
qubits tends to infinity. Our results represent a significant advance towards
the realistic implementation of teleportation in both large-scale and
near-future quantum architectures that are susceptible to qubit loss, such as
linear optical quantum computation and quantum communication networks.

able to extract more information from the mass maps than the commonly used
power spectrum, and thus achieve better precision for cosmological parameter
measurement. We explore the advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
over the power spectrum for varying levels of shape noise and different
smoothing scales applied to the maps. We compare the cosmological constraints
from the two methods in the $\Omega_M-\sigma_8$ plane for sets of 400 deg$^2$
convergence maps. We find that, for a shape noise level corresponding to 8.53
galaxies/arcmin$^2$ and the smoothing scale of $\sigma_s = 2.34$ arcmin, the
network is able to generate 45% tighter constraints. For smaller smoothing
scale of $\sigma_s = 1.17$ the improvement can reach $\sim 50 \%$, while for
larger smoothing scale of $\sigma_s = 5.85$, the improvement decreases to 19%.
The advantage generally decreases when the noise level and smoothing scales
increase. We present a new training strategy to train the neural network with
noisy data, as well as considerations for practical applications of the deep
learning approach.

introduced in order to provide a simple abstraction for overlay networks.
Congested Clique is a model of distributed (or parallel) computing, in which
there are $n$ players with unique identifiers from set [n], which perform
computations in synchronous rounds. Each round consists of the phase of
unlimited local computation and the communication phase. While communicating,
each pair of players is allowed to exchange a single message of size $O(\log
n)$ bits.
  Since, in a single round, each player can communicate with even $\Theta(n)$
other players, the model seems to be to powerful to imitate bandwidth
restriction emerging from the underlying network. In this paper we study a
restricted version of the Congested Clique model, the Node Congested Clique
(NCC) model, proposed by Augustine et al.[arxiv1805], in which a player is
allowed to send/receive only $O(\log n)$ messages per communication phase.
  More precisely, we provide communication primitives that improve the round
complexity of the MST algorithm by Augustine et al. [arxiv1805] to $O(\log^3
n)$ rounds, and give an $O(\log^2 n)$ round algorithm solving the Spanning
Forest (SF) problem. Furthermore, we present an approach based on the random

Then, we investigate the relationship between selective exposure and content

to consume contents that are more diverse. We find that people autonomously
consume more diverse contents from a macro-perspective without an external
influence, suggesting that people are less likely to be fragmented and
polarized, although from a micro-perspective they consume limited contents. We
also obtain evidence that users who consume highly ambiguous contents tend to
increase the diversity of their consumed contents.

where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. A direct simulation of
classic PRAM and distributed algorithms from the 1980s results in algorithms

  The result is obtained by repeatedly compressing several rounds of a natural

the optically-induced $^{31}$P hyperpolarization in the natural abundance

build-up and nuclear spin T$_1$ times at high field are likely due to the
shorter electron-spin T$_1$, which drives nuclear spin relaxation via
non-secular hyperfine interactions. At 6.7 T, the phosphorus nuclear spin

the combination of NGVS photometry and follow-up spectroscopy allows us to
reject foreground star contamination and explore GC kinematics over the full
Virgo dynamical range. The GC kinematics changes gradually with galactocentric
distance, decreasing in mean velocity and increasing in velocity dispersion,
eventually becoming indistinguishable from the kinematics of Virgo dwarf
galaxies at $\mathrm{R>320\, kpc}$. By kinematically tagging M87 halo and
intra-cluster GCs we find that 1) the M87 halo has a smaller fraction

$S_{N,\mathrm{ICL}}=10.2\pm4.8$, is consistent with what is observed for the
population of quenched, low-mass galaxies within 1~Mpc from the cluster's
center. The IC population at Virgo's center is thus consistent with being an
accreted component from low-mass galaxies tidally stripped or disrupted through
interactions, with a total mass of

examined with the aid of the ferrolens. We are presenting experimental and

is free of these limitations and its far more advanced visualization

taking place there, leading to the inescapable conclusion, novel observation
and experimental evidence that the field of any dipole magnet actually consists
of two distinct and separate toroidal shaped 3D magnetic bubbles, each located
at either side of the dipole around the exact spatial regions where the two

The first is a decoupling limit on AdS space where the mass goes to zero while
the AdS radius is held fixed. This results in an interacting massive Proca
vector theory with a $\Lambda_2\sim (M_{\rm Pl} m)^{1/2}$ strong coupling scale
which is ghost-free by construction and yet can not be put in the form of the
generalized Proca theories considered so far. We comment on the existence of a
potential duality between this Proca theory and a CFT on the boundary. The
second decoupling limit we consider is a new limit on dS, obtained by sending
the mass towards the finite partially massless value. We do this by introducing
the scalar St\""uckelberg field which restores the partially massless symmetry.
For generic values of the parameters, only a finite number of operators enter
the partially massless decoupling limit and take the form of dS Galileons. If
the interactions are chosen to be precisely those of the `candidate' non-linear
partially massless theory, the resulting strong coupling scale has a higher
value and the resulting decoupling limit includes an infinite number of
interactions which we give in closed form. These interactions preserve both the
linear partially massless symmetry and the dS version of the Galileon shift
symmetry.

rate of decline appears particularly strong in the 10-20 \r{A} range. The
dependence broadly supports the proposed ""shielding"" model for WLQs, in which a
geometrically and optically thick inner accretion disk, expected for a quasar
accreting at a high Eddington ratio, both prevents ionizing EUV/X-ray photons
from reaching the high-ionization broad emission-line region and also sometimes
blocks the line-of-sight to the central X-ray emitting region. This model is
also supported by the hard average spectral shape of X-ray weak WLQs (with a
power-law effective photon index of $\Gamma_{\rm eff}=1.19^{+0.56}_{-0.45}$).
Additionally, we have examined UV continuum/emission-line properties that might
trace X-ray weakness among WLQs, confirming that red UV continuum color is the

distributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because
most supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of
the disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered
alleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of
clustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well
before the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are
reduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy
released by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These
energetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject
substantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star
formation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by
the SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the
surroundings. We show that our conclusions hold for a range of galaxy
properties, both in the local Universe (e.g., M82) and at high redshift (e.g.,
$z \sim 2$ star forming galaxies). We further show that if the efficiency of
forming star clusters increases with increasing gas surface density, as
suggested by theoretical arguments, the condition for star cluster-driven
super-bubbles to break out of galactic discs corresponds to a threshold star
formation rate surface density for the onset of galactic winds $\sim 0.03$

morphological transformation than retrograde mergers -- while both types of

58004-58012), the source shows an optical-NIR spectrum that is consistent with
an optically thin synchrotron power-law from a jet. After MJD 58015, however,
the source faded considerably, the drop in flux being much more evident at
lower frequencies. Before the fading, we measure a de-reddened flux density of
$\gtrsim$100 mJy in the mid-infrared, making MAXI J1535-571 one of the
brightest mid-infrared BHBs known so far. A significant softening of the X-ray
spectrum is evident contemporaneous with the infrared fade. We interpret it as
due to the suppression of the jet emission, similar to the accretion-ejection
coupling seen in other BHBs. However, MAXI J1535-571 did not transition
smoothly to the soft state, instead showing X-ray hardness deviations,

rotate. This anisotropy leads to a misalignment of the thermal gradient and the
thermal flux, which in turn results in baroclinicity and circulation currents
in the upper radiative zone. We show that this induces a much stronger
meridional flow in the radiative zone than previously thought. This drives
significantly enhanced mixing, though this mixing does not necessarily reach
the surface. The extra mixing takes on a similar form to convective
overshooting, and is relatively insensitive to the rotation rate above a
threshold, and may help explain the large overshoot distances inferred from
observations. This has significant consequences for the evolution of these
stars by enhancing core-envelope mixing.

and its time integrals, which are closely connected to changes in the charges
that characterize asymptotically flat spacetimes. The first GW memory effect
discovered was a lasting change in the GW strain. It can occur when GWs or
massless fields carry away 4-momentum from an isolated source. Subsequently, it
was shown that fluxes of intrinsic angular momentum can generate a new type of
memory effect called the spin memory, which is an enduring change in a portion
of the time integral of the GW strain. In this paper, we note that there is
another new type of memory effect. We call it the center-of-mass (CM) memory
effect, because it is related to changes in the CM part of the angular momentum
of a spacetime. We first examine a few properties of the CM angular momentum.
Specifically, we describe how it transforms under the supertranslation symmetry
transformations of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, and we compute a new
expression for the flux of CM angular momentum carried by GWs in terms of a set
of radiative multipole moments of the GW strain. We then turn to the CM memory
effect. The CM memory effect appears in a quantity which has units of the time
integral of the GW strain. We define the effect in asymptotically flat
spacetimes that start in a stationary state, radiate, and settle to a different
stationary state. We show that it is invariant under infinitesimal
supertranslation symmetries in this context. To determine the magnitude of the
flux of CM angular momentum and the CM memory effect, we compute these
quantities for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the
post-Newtonian approximation. The CM memory effect arises from terms in the
gravitational waveform for such binaries beginning at third and fourth
post-Newtonian order for unequal- and equal-mass binaries, respectively.

The simplest strategy for decoherence reduction is dynamical decoupling (DD),
which requires no encoding overhead and works by converting quantum gates into
decoupling pulses. Here, using the IBM and Rigetti platforms, we demonstrate
that the DD method is suitable for implementation in today's relatively noisy
and small-scale cloud based quantum computers. Using DD, we achieve substantial
fidelity gains relative to unprotected, free evolution of individual
superconducting transmon qubits. To a lesser degree, DD is also capable of
protecting entangled two-qubit states. We show that dephasing and spontaneous
emission errors are dominant in these systems, and that different DD sequences
are capable of mitigating both effects. Unlike previous work demonstrating the
use of quantum error correcting codes on the same platforms, we make no use of
post-selection and hence report unconditional fidelity improvements against
natural decoherence.

surge of VR/AR displays that hinder face-to-face communications. Different from
the state-of-the-art face inpainting methods that have no control over the
synthesized content and can only handle frontal face pose, our approach can
faithfully recover the missing content under various head poses while
preserving the identity. At the core of our method is a novel generative
network with dedicated constraints to regularize the synthesis process. To
preserve the identity, our network takes an arbitrary occlusion-free image of
the target identity to infer the missing content, and its high-level CNN
features as an identity prior to regularize the searching space of generator.
Since the input reference image may have a different pose, a pose map and a
novel pose discriminator are further adopted to supervise the learning of
implicit pose transformations. Our method is capable of generating coherent
facial inpainting with consistent identity over videos with large variations of
head motions. Experiments on both synthesized and real data demonstrate that
our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both

roughly speaking, quantifies the amount of quantum information contained in a

available, in a regime that is often referred to as being asymptotic. In this
work, we provide a new operational characterization of the von Neumann entropy
which neither requires an i.i.d. limit nor any explicit randomness. We do so by
showing that the von Neumann entropy fully characterizes single-shot state
transitions in unitary quantum mechanics, as long as one has access to a
catalyst - an ancillary system that can be re-used after the transition - and
an environment which has the effect of dephasing in a preferred basis. Building
upon these insights, we formulate and provide evidence for the catalytic
entropy conjecture, which states that the above result holds true even in the
absence of decoherence. If true, this would prove an intimate connection
between single-shot state transitions in unitary quantum mechanics and the von
Neumann entropy. Our results add significant support to recent insights that,
contrary to common wisdom, the standard von Neumann entropy also characterizes
single-shot situations and opens up the possibility for operational single-shot
interpretations of other standard entropic quantities. We discuss implications
of these insights to readings of the third law of quantum thermodynamics and
hint at potentially profound implications to holography.

photonic microring weight banks, which use broadcast-and-weight protocol to
perform Multiply And Accumulate (MAC) operation and move data through layers of
a neural network. Here, we aim to exploit the synergy between the inherent
parallelism of photonics in the form of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

millisecond pulsars (MSPs) alone because of a significant discrepancy between
the MSP spectral properties and those of 47 Tuc. It is argued that there is a
significant ($>5\sigma$) preference for a two source scenario. The second
component could be from the annihilation of dark matter in a density spike
surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole candidate in 47 Tuc. In this paper
we argue that the claimed discrepancy arises because Brown et al. (2017) use a
stacked MSP spectrum to model the emission from MSPs in 47 Tuc which is
insufficient to account for the uncertainties in the spectrum of the MSPs in 47
Tuc. Contrary to the claims by Brown et al. (2018), we show that the
significance of an additional dark matter component is $\lesssim 2\sigma$ when
sample variance in the spectrum of a population of MSPs is accounted for. The
spectrum of 47 Tuc is compatible with that of a population of MSPs similar to
the disk population.

the bottom of the hill-slope contributes to the total overland runoff, while
for high rainfall (the supercritical case) the whole slope contributes and the
total runoff increases dramatically. We identify the critical point at which
the phase-change occurs, and show how it depends on the degree of coalescence.
When there is no stream coalescence the critical point occurs when the rainfall
rate equals the average infiltration rate, but when we allow coalescence the
critical point occurs when the rainfall rate is less than the average
infiltration rate, and increasing the amount of coalescence increases the total

Quantum Electrodynamics architectures can be used to study the internal degrees
of freedom of such a many-body phenomenon. We couple a quantum dot to a high
finesse microwave cavity to measure with an unprecedented sensitivity the dot
electronic compressibility i.e. the ability of the dot to accommodate charges.
Because it corresponds solely to the charge response of the electronic system,
this quantity is not equivalent to the conductance which involves in general
other degrees of freedom such as spin. By performing dual
conductance/compressibility measurements in the Kondo regime, we uncover
directly the charge dynamics of this peculiar mechanism of electron transfer.
Strikingly, the Kondo resonance, visible in transport measurements, is
transparent to microwave photons trapped in the high finesse cavity. This
reveals that, in such a many body resonance, finite conduction is achieved from
a charge frozen by Coulomb interaction. This previously elusive freezing of
charge dynamics is in stark contrast with the physics of a free electron gas.
Our setup highlights the power of circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures

acts as a fluorine vapor source, was investigated by utilizing polyvinyl
fluoride (PVF), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) in the reaction. The same process was carried out with polyethylene (PE)
to isolate the role of carbon in the vapor transport process. The F
distribution was probed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, which confirmed
the incorporation of F into the films and revealed higher F concentrations in
films exposed to PVF and PVDF compared to PTFE. The c-axis parameter expands
after fluorination, a result consistent with density functional theory
calculations that attribute the volume expansion to elongated Mn-F bonds
compared to shorter Mn-O bonds. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show
that the fluorination process reduces the nominal Mn oxidation state suggesting
that F substitutes on O sites in the lattice as opposed to filling anion
vacancy sites, a finding further supported by calculated formation energies of
different F site occupancies. These results provide new insights into
topochemical fluorination of perovskite oxides, which should enable future

of special points is strict if any CM elliptic curve appears at most finitely
many times and no relation between the points in the tuple is satisfied
infinitely often. The genus orbit of a special point is the

that genus orbits of special points in a strict sequence equidistribute in

  A genus orbit can be very sparse in the full Galois orbit. In particular, the

whistlers on fast particles. This situation stimulates the search for new
mechanisms. For example, earlier we showed the importance of explosive
instability, at least for large flares with the ejections of protons. In the
system a weakly relativistic beam of protons, nonisothermic plasma, the slow
beam mode of the space charge possesses negative energy, and in the triplet
slow and fast beam modes and ion acoustic wave an explosive cascade of
harmonics from ionic sound is excited. Electromagnetic waves in the form of ZS

understand how mergers affect galaxies, uncertainty remains about M31's most
important mergers. Previous studies focused individually on the giant stellar
stream or the impact of M32 on M31's disk, thereby suggesting many substantial
satellite interactions. Yet models of M31's disk heating and the similarity
between the stellar populations of different tidal substructures in M31's
outskirts both suggested a single large merger. M31's stellar halo (its outer
low-surface-brightness regions) is built up from the tidal debris of satellites
and provides information about its important mergers. Here we use cosmological
models of galaxy formation to show that M31's massive and metal-rich stellar
halo, containing intermediate-age stars, dramatically narrows the range of
allowed interactions, requiring a single dominant merger with a large galaxy
(with stellar mass about 2.5 x 10^10 solar masses, the third largest member of
the Local Group) about 2 Gyr ago. This single event explains many observations
that were previously considered separately: M31's compact and metal-rich
satellite M32 is likely to be the stripped core of the disrupted galaxy, its
rotating inner stellar halo contains most of the merger debris, and the giant
stellar stream is likely to have been thrown out during the merger. This
interaction may explain M31's global burst of star formation about 2 Gyr ago in
which approximately a fifth of its stars were formed. Moreover, M31's disk and
bulge were already in place, suggesting that mergers of this magnitude need not
dramatically affect galaxy structure.

patient monitoring data, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), real-time vital signs

data, due to high density of the monitoring data, heterogeneous data types and
the requirement for interpretable models. Integration of these high-density
monitoring data with the discrete clinical events (including diagnosis,
medications, labs) is challenging but potentially rewarding since richness and
granularity in such multimodal data increase the possibilities for accurate
detection of complex problems and predicting outcomes (e.g., length of stay and
mortality). We propose Recurrent Attentive and Intensive Model (RAIM) for
jointly analyzing continuous monitoring data and discrete clinical events. RAIM
introduces an efficient attention mechanism for continuous monitoring data
(e.g., ECG), which is guided by discrete clinical events (e.g, medication
usage). We apply RAIM in predicting physiological decompensation and length of
stay in those critically ill patients at ICU. With evaluations on MIMIC- III

testing, allowing for earlier detection of faults or helping to reduce testing

growing number of studies have evaluated them against synthetic software
defects, called mutants. Hence, it is currently unclear to what extent TCP
performance on mutants would be representative of the performance achieved on
real faults. To answer this fundamental question, we conduct the first
empirical study comparing the performance of TCP techniques applied to both
real-world and mutation faults. The context of our study includes eight
well-studied TCP approaches, 35k+ mutation faults, and 357 real-world faults
from five Java systems in the Defects4J dataset. Our results indicate that the
relative performance of the studied TCP techniques on mutants may not strongly
correlate with performance on real faults, depending upon attributes of the
subject programs. This suggests that, in certain contexts, the best performing
technique on a set of mutants may not be the best technique in practice when
applied to real faults. We also illustrate that these correlations vary for
mutants generated by different operators depending on whether chosen operators
reflect typical faults of a subject program. This highlights the importance,
particularly for TCP, of developing mutation operators tailored for specific
program domains.

wavefront in all three models, while the wavefront broadens as $t^{1/3}$ in the
short-range model and shows no broadening in the long-range model and the
Luttinger liquid model. For the boson creation operator, the corresponding
commutator function shows saturation inside the light cone in all three models,
with similar wavefront behavior as in the density-density commutator function,
despite the presence of a nonlocal string in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions.
For the long-range model and the Luttinger liquid model, the commutator
function decays as power law outside the light cone in the long time regime
when following different fixed-velocity rays. In all cases, the OTOCs approach
their long-time values in a power-law fashion, with different exponents for
different observables and short-range vs long-range cases. Our long-range model
appears to capture exponents in the Luttinger liquid model (which are found to
be independent of the Luttinger parameter in the model). This conclusion also
bears on the OTOC calculations in conformal field theories, which we propose

the assignment of definite properties to a macroscopic object (realism). In
this work we develop a method to investigate the indefiniteness of cat states
using currently available cold atom technology. The method we propose uses the
observation of a statistical distribution to demonstrate the macroscopic
distinction between dead and alive states, and uses the determination of the
interferometric sensitivity (Fisher information) to detect the indefiniteness
of the cat's vital status. We show how combining the two observations can
provide information about the structure of the quantum state without the need
for full quantum state tomography, and propose a measure of the indefiniteness
based on this structure. We test this method using a cat state proposed by
Gordon and Savage [Phys. Rev. A 59, 4623 (1999)] which is dynamically produced
from a coherent state. As a control, we consider a set of states produced using
the same dynamical procedure acting on an initial thermal distribution.
Numerically simulating our proposed method, we show that as the temperature of
this initial state is increased, the produced state undergoes a quantum to
classical crossover where the indefiniteness of the cat's vital status is lost,
while the macroscopic distinction between dead and alive states of the cat is
maintained.

deliver a 1.5x and 2x improvement in FWHM at optical (500 nm) and infrared (1.5

a Keck GLAO feed in that it has excellent image quality and is on the
telescope's optical axis. However, it lacks an atmospheric dispersion
compensator, which would limit the minimum usable slit size for long-exposure
science cases. Similarly, while LRIS and DEIMOS may be able to accept a GLAO
feed based on their internal image quality, they lack either an atmospheric
dispersion compensator (DEIMOS) or flexure compensation (LRIS) to utilize
narrower slits matched to the GLAO image quality. However, some science cases
needing shorter exposures may still benefit from Keck GLAO and we will
investigate the possibility of installing an ADC.

autoimmune disease (ankylosing spondylitis), patients under cancer

longitudinal data collection nor large cohorts, and is thus directly applicable
to most RepSeq datasets. Its results facilitate the identification of TCR

of lopsided structures. One of the possible mechanisms for producing vortices
is the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). In our previous work, we have performed
detailed linear stability analyses of the RWI with various initial conditions.
In this paper, we perform numerical simulations of the vortex formation by the
RWI in 2D barotropic disks using the Athena++ code. As initial conditions, we
consider axisymmetric disks with a Gaussian surface density bump of various
contrasts and half-widths. Perturbations grow as expected from the linear
stability analyses in the linear and weakly non-linear regimes. After the
saturation, multiple vortices are formed in accordance with the most unstable
azimuthal mode and coalesce one after another. In the end, only one
quasi-stationary vortex (the RWI vortex) remains, which migrates inward. During
the RWI evolution, the axisymmetric component approaches the stable
configuration. We find that the axisymmetric component reaches the marginally
stable state for the most unstable azimuthal mode at the saturation and the
marginally stable state for the m = 1 mode at the final vortex merger. We
investigate the structure and evolution of the RWI vortices. We obtain some
empirical relations between the properties of the RWI vortices and the initial
conditions. Using tracer particle analyses, we find that the RWI vortex can be
considered as a physical entity like a large fluid particle. Our results
provide a solid theoretical ground for quantitative interpretation of the
observed lopsided structures in protoplanetary disks.

technique in the sequential tunneling regime. To distinguish various
contributions to Andreev current we calculate the current cross-correlations,
i.e. correlations between currents flowing through two junctions with normal
leads. We analyze dependence of current cross-correlations on various
parameters of the considered model, both in linear and nonlinear transport

Interestingly, our results show that for specific transport regimes splitted
Cooper pair results in two uncorrelated electrons. However, utilizing

discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) that can be used to
more efficiently treat problems in control and optimization, uncertainty

solutions. In this work, a ROM is developed and tested for the treatment of
nonlinear PDEs whose solutions bifurcate as input parameter values change. In
such cases, the parameter domain can be subdivided into subregions, each of
which corresponds to a different branch of solutions. Popular ROM approaches
such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), results in a global
low-dimensional basis that does no respect not take advantage of the often
large differences in the PDE solutions corresponding to different subregions.
Instead, in the new method, the k-means algorithm is used to cluster snapshots
so that within cluster snapshots are similar to each other and are dissimilar
to those in other clusters. This is followed by the construction of local POD
bases, one for each cluster. The method also can detect which cluster a new
parameter point belongs to, after which the local basis corresponding to that
cluster is used to determine a ROM approximation. Numerical experiments show
the effectiveness of the method both for problems for which bifurcation cause
continuous and discontinuous changes in the solution of the PDE.

processes. They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain
stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional
interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting
partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise
maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of
amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of
multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of
known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have
been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners
among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data
alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner
identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual
information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our
mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of
interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with
structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence
data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models
substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings
entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction
from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct

However, significant time and effort is frequently required to tune various
Kalman filter model parameters, e.g. process noise covariance, pre-whitening
filter models for non-white noise, etc. Conventional optimization techniques
for tuning can get stuck in poor local minima and can be expensive to implement
with real sensor data. To address these issues, a new ""black box"" Bayesian
optimization strategy is developed for automatically tuning Kalman filters. In
this approach, performance is characterized by one of two stochastic objective
functions: normalized estimation error squared (NEES) when ground truth state
models are available, or the normalized innovation error squared (NIS) when
only sensor data is available. By intelligently sampling the parameter space to
both learn and exploit a nonparametric Gaussian process surrogate function for
the NEES/NIS costs, Bayesian optimization can efficiently identify multiple
local minima and provide uncertainty quantification on its results.

embedding theory (PET) [Manby et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 8, 2564, 2012],
restricted to the context of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. By
partitioning the global degrees of freedom into a `system' part and a `bath'
part, and by choosing a proper projector from the bath, PET is an in principle
exact formulation to confine the calculation to the system part only, and hence
can be carried out with reduced computational cost. Viewed from the perspective
of the domain decomposition method, one particularly interesting feature of PET
is that it does not enforce a boundary condition explicitly, and remains
applicable even when the discretized Hamiltonian matrix is dense, such as in
the context of the planewave discretization. In practice, the accuracy of PET
depends on the accuracy of the projector for the bath. Based on the linear
algebra reformulation, we develop a first order perturbation correction to the
projector from the bath to improve its accuracy. Numerical results for real
chemical systems indicate that with a proper choice of reference system, the
perturbatively corrected PET can be sufficiently accurate even when strong
perturbation is applied to very small systems, such as the computation of the
ground state energy of a SiH$_3$F molecule, using a SiH$_4$ molecule as the
reference system.

a similar evolution as the star formation history. This is physically
motivated, since stars form out of this component of the neutral gas and if the
case, would resolve the longstanding issue that there is a clear disparity
between the total abundance of neutral gas and star forming activity over the
history of the Universe. Radio-band 21-cm absorption traces the cold gas and
comparison with the Lyman-alpha absorption, which traces all of the gas,
provides a measure of the cold gas fraction or the spin temperature. The recent
study has shown that the spin temperature (degenerate with the ratio of the
absorber/emitter extent) appears to be anti-correlated with the star formation
density, undergoing a similar steep evolution as the star formation rate over
redshifts of 0 < z < 3, whereas the total neutral hydrogen exhibits little
evolution. Above z > 3, where the SFR shows a steep decline with redshift,
there is insufficient 21-cm data to determine whether the spin temperature
continues to follow the SFR. Knowing this is paramount in ascertaining whether
the cold neutral gas does trace the star formation over the Universe's history.
We explore the feasibility of resolving this with 21-cm observations of the
largest contemporary sample of reliable damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems
and conclude that, while today's largest radio interferometers can reach the
required sensitivity at z < 3.5, the Square Kilometre Array is required to
probe to higher redshifts.

superior electrical and optical properties as a direct bandgap semiconductor

from transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in which the direct bandgap only
exists at the single layer limit. However, absorption in InSe is mostly
dominated by an out-of-plane dipole contribution which results in the limited
absorption of normally incident light which can only excite the in-plane dipole
at resonance. To address this challenge, we have explored a unique geometric
ridge state of the 2D flake without compromising the sample quality. We
observed the enhanced absorption at the ridge over a broad range of excitation
frequencies from photocurrent and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. In
addition, we have discovered new PL peaks at low temperature due to defect
states on the ridge, which can be as much as ~ 60 times stronger than the
intrinsic PL peak of InSe. Interestingly, the PL of the defects is highly
tunable through an external electrical field, which can be attributed to the
Stark effect of the localized defects. InSe ridges thus provide new avenues for
manipulating light-matter interaction and defect-engineering which are vitally
crucial for novel optoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductors.

and are insufficient when division across chemical bonds is unavoidable.
Recently, density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and other methods based on the
Schmidt decomposition have emerged as a fresh approach to this problem. Despite
their success on model systems, these methods can prove difficult for realistic
systems because they rely on either a rigid, non-overlapping partition of the
system or a specification of some special sites (i.e. `edge' and `center'
sites), neither of which is well-defined in general for real molecules. In this
work, we present a new Schmidt decomposition-based embedding scheme called
Incremental Embedding that allows the combination of arbitrary overlapping
fragments without the knowledge of edge sites. This method forms a convergent
hierarchy in the sense that higher accuracy can be obtained by using fragments
involving more sites. The computational scaling for the first few levels is
lower than that of most correlated wave function methods. We present results
for several small molecules in atom-centered Gaussian basis sets and
demonstrate that Incremental Embedding converges quickly with fragment size and
recovers most static correlation in small basis sets even when truncated at the
second lowest level.

reported that a notable number of nearby non-merging BBHs, i.e. those BBHs that
are expected to undergo further dynamical interactions before merger, in GCs

the distribution of $\log f$ for the non-merging BBH population above $\sim

us to conclude that observing nearby BBHs with LISA is not as likely as has
been claimed in the recent literature. In fact, our results suggest that it
might be more likely that LISA detects the population of BBHs that will merge

We investigate the angular changes of galaxy spin vectors in clusters - denser

simulations of 17 clusters YZiCS and a set of complementary controlled
simulations. The magnitude by which galaxies change their spin vector is found
to be a function of their rotational support with larger cumulative angular
changes of spin vectors when they have initially lower $V_{\theta}/\sigma$. We
find that both mergers and tidal perturbations can significantly swing spin
vectors, with larger changes in spin vector for smaller pericentre distances.
Strong tidal perturbations are also correlated with the changes in stellar mass
and specific angular momentum of satellite galaxies. However, changes in spin
vector can often result in a canceling out of previous changes. As a result,
the integrated angular change is always much larger than the angular change
measured at any instant. Also, overall the majority of satellite galaxies do
not undergo mergers or sufficiently strong tidal perturbation after infall into
clusters, and thus they end up suffering little change to their spin vectors.

into some intermediate representation used for constructing models. Since the
underlying task is often insensitive to time shifts, these representations are
required to be time-shift invariant. We introduce the joint time-frequency
scattering transform, a time-shift invariant representation which characterizes
the multiscale energy distribution of a signal in time and frequency. It is
computed through wavelet convolutions and modulus non-linearities and may
therefore be implemented as a deep convolutional neural network whose filters
are not learned but calculated from wavelets. We consider the progression from
mel-spectrograms to time scattering and joint time-frequency scattering
transforms, illustrating the relationship between increased discriminability
and refinements of convolutional network architectures. The suitability of the
joint time-frequency scattering transform for time-shift invariant
characterization of time series is demonstrated through applications to chirp
signals and audio synthesis experiments. The proposed transform also obtains
state-of-the-art results on several audio classification tasks, outperforming
time scattering transforms and achieving accuracies comparable to those of
fully learned networks.

non-Hermiticity of which arises from the staggered on-site complex potential.
The boundary ELs are topological, but the non-boundary ELs are not. Each
non-boundary EL corresponds to two critical momenta that make opposite
contributions to the Berry connection. Therefore, the Berry connection of the
many-particle quantum state can have classical correspondence, which is
determined merely by the boundary ELs. Furthermore, the non-zero Berry phase,
which experiences a closed path in the parameter space, is dependent on how the
curve surrounds the boundary EL. This also provides an alternative way to

$\Delta + 1$ colors that can be found via a simple sequential greedy algorithm
in linear time and space. But can one find such a coloring via a sublinear
algorithm?
  We answer this fundamental question in the affirmative for several canonical
classes of sublinear algorithms including graph streaming, sublinear time, and
massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithms. In particular, we design:
  * A single-pass semi-streaming algorithm in dynamic streams using
$\tilde{O}(n)$ space. The only known semi-streaming algorithm prior to our work
was a folklore O(log n)-pass algorithm obtained by simulating classical
distributed algorithms in the streaming model.
  * A sublinear-time algorithm in the standard query model that allows neighbor
queries and pair queries using $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{n})$ time. We further show
that any algorithm that outputs a valid coloring with sufficiently large
constant probability requires $\Omega(n\sqrt{n})$ time. No non-trivial
sublinear time algorithms were known prior to our work.
  * A parallel algorithm in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model
using $\tilde{O}(n)$ memory per machine and $O(1)$ MPC rounds. Our number of
rounds significantly improves upon the recent
$O(\log\log{\Delta}\cdot\log^*{(n)})$-round algorithm of Parter [ICALP 2018].
  At the core of our results is a remarkably simple meta-algorithm for the
$(\Delta+1)$ coloring problem: Sample $O(\log{n})$ colors for each vertex from
the $\Delta+1$ colors; find a proper coloring of the graph using only the
sampled colors. We prove that the sampled set of colors with high probability
contains a proper coloring of the input graph. The sublinear algorithms are
then obtained by designing efficient algorithms for finding a proper coloring
of the graph from the sampled colors in the corresponding models.

  We present Nuri, a general subgraph discovery system that allows users to

of single substitutional nitrogen, N$^0$ . The polarization of the individual
NV centres in the diamond is dependent on the separation of the NV$^-$ and the
nitrogen donor. When the NV$^-$ - N$^+$ pair separation is large the properties
of the pair will be as for single sites and a high degree of spin polarization
attainable. When the separation decreases the emission is reduced, the lifetime
shortened and the spin polarization downgraded. The deterioration occurs as a
consequence of electron tunneling in the excited state from NV$^-$ to N$^+$ and
results in an optical cycle that includes NV$^0$. The tunneling process is
linear in optical excitation and more prevalent the closer the N$^+$ is to the
NV$^-$ centre. However, the separation between the NV$^-$ and its donor N$^+$
can be effected by light through the excitation of NV$^-$ and/or ionization of
N$^0$. The optical excitation that creates the spin polarization can also
modify the sample properties and during excitation creates charge dynamics. The
consequence is that the magnitude of spin polarization, the spin relaxation and
coherence times T$_1$ and T$_2$ have a dependence on the nitrogen concentration
and on the excitation wavelength. The adjacent N$^+$ gives an electric field
that Stark shifts the NV$^-$ transitions and for an ensemble results in line
broadening. It is observation of changes of these Stark induced effects that
allow the variation in NV$^-$ - N$^+$ separation to be monitored. Spectroscopic
measurements including that of the varying line widths are central to the
study. They are made at low temperatures and include extensive measurements of
the NV$^-$ optical transition at 637 nm, the infrared transition at 1042 nm and
ODMR at 2.87 GHz.

simply included in the last step of the simulation (i.e. post-processed) to
cases in which clouds and their radiative feedback are actively included
throughout the duration of the simulation. When clouds and radiative feedback
were actively included, cloud cover decreased at equatorial regions and
increased towards the poles relative to the post-processed solutions. The
resulting phase curves also differed between the two approaches; the
post-processed cloud simulations predicted weaker day-night contrasts in
emission and greater eastward shifts in the maximum emission compared to the
active cloud modeling. This illustrates the importance of cloud radiative
feedback and shows that post-processing will provide inaccurate solutions when
clouds are thick enough to provide significant scattering.

extensive air showers from secondary leptons. To test this on an example model,
we simulate the production of staus inside the earth from interactions between
ultra-high energy neutrinos and nuclei. We propose that results of ANITA
searches for upgoing air showers can be interpreted in terms of constraints on
long-lived, charged massive particles (CHAMPs) and consider a supersymmetric
partner of the tau lepton, the stau, as an example of such a particle.
Exploring the parameter space in stau mass and lifetimes, we find that the stau
properties that lead to an observable signal in ANITA are highly energy
dependent. At $10^{18.5}$ eV, we find that the best constraints on the product
of the neutrino flux and the stau production cross section would be placed near
$m_{\tilde{\tau}}=$1 TeV and $\tau_{\tilde{\tau}}=$10 ns. Thus ANITA could be
sensitive to new physics in a region of parameter space that is unconstrained
by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.

For both scenarios, we formulate wiretapping SNR maximization problems. For the

chiral p-wave superconductor, has been investigated from the perspective of the
dependence of its specific heat on magnetic field angles at temperatures as low
as 0.06 K ($\sim 0.04T_{\rm c}$). Except near $H_{\rm c2}$, its fourfold
specific-heat oscillation under an in-plane rotating magnetic field is unlikely
to change its sign down to the lowest temperature of 0.06 K. This feature is
qualitatively different from nodal quasiparticle excitations of a

The overall specific-heat behavior of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ can be explained by
Doppler-shifted quasiparticles around horizontal line nodes on the Fermi
surface, whose in-plane Fermi velocity is highly anisotropic, along with the
occurrence of the Pauli-paramagnetic effect. These findings, in particular, the

network has been barely studied due to the inconsistent performance of complex
network characteristics and lack of inherent objective function. In this paper,
we propose the IFSAD, a new two-phase ensemble method for anomaly detection
based on intuitionistic fuzzy set, and applies it to the abnormal behavior
detection problem in temporal complex networks. First, it constructs the
intuitionistic fuzzy set of single network characteristic which quantifies the
degree of membership, non-membership and hesitation of each of network
characteristic to the defined linguistic variables so that makes the unuseful
or noise characteristics become part of the detection. To build an objective
intuitionistic fuzzy relationship, we propose an Gaussian distribution-based
membership function which gives a variable hesitation degree. Then, for the
fuzzification of multiple network characteristics, the intuitionistic fuzzy
weighted geometric operator is adopted to fuse multiple IFSs and to avoid the
inconsistent of multiple characteristics. Finally, the score function and
precision function are used to sort the fused IFS. Finally we carried out
extensive experiments on several complex network datasets for anomaly
detection, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method to
state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our method.

its generality, simplicity of use, and the utility of Bayesian predictions. The
predominant implementation of GP regression is a nonparameteric kernel-based
approach, as it enables fitting of arbitrary nonlinear functions. However, this
approach suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) it is computationally
inefficient, as computation scales poorly with the number of samples; and (2)
it can be data inefficient, as encoding prior knowledge that can aid the model
through the choice of kernel and associated hyperparameters is often
challenging and unintuitive. In this work, we propose ALPaCA, an algorithm for
efficient Bayesian regression which addresses these issues. ALPaCA uses a
dataset of sample functions to learn a domain-specific, finite-dimensional
feature encoding, as well as a prior over the associated weights, such that
Bayesian linear regression in this feature space yields accurate online
predictions of the posterior predictive density. These features are neural
networks, which are trained via a meta-learning (or ""learning-to-learn"")
approach. ALPaCA extracts all prior information directly from the dataset,
rather than restricting prior information to the choice of kernel
hyperparameters. Furthermore, by operating in the weight space, it
substantially reduces sample complexity. We investigate the performance of
ALPaCA on two simple regression problems, two simulated robotic systems, and on
a lane-change driving task performed by humans. We find our approach
outperforms kernel-based GP regression, as well as state of the art
meta-learning approaches, thereby providing a promising plug-in tool for many
regression tasks in robotics where scalability and data-efficiency are
important.

the quality of single voxel MR spectroscopy data due to incoherent averaging.
Retrospective correction has previously been shown to improve data quality by
adjusting the phase and frequency offset of each average to match a reference
spectrum. In this work, a new method (RATS) is developed to be tolerant to
large frequency shifts (greater than 7Hz) and baseline instability resulting
from inconsistent water suppression. Methods: in contrast to previous
approaches, the variable-projection method and baseline fitting is incorporated
into the correction procedure to improve robustness to fluctuating baseline
signals and optimization instability. RATS is compared to an alternative
method, based on time-domain spectral registration (TDSR), using simulated data
to model frequency, phase and baseline instability. In addition, a J-difference
edited glutathione in-vivo dataset is processed using both approaches and
compared. Results: RATS offers improved accuracy and stability for large
frequency shifts and unstable baselines. Reduced subtraction artifacts are
demonstrated for glutathione edited MRS when using RATS, compared with
uncorrected or TDSR corrected spectra. Conclusion: the RATS algorithm has been
shown to provide accurate retrospective correction of SVS MRS data in the
presence of large frequency shifts and baseline instability. The method is
rapid, generic and therefore readily incorporated into MRS processing pipelines
to improve lineshape, SNR and aid quality assessment.

signal-to-noise ratios and proper validation of predictive methods is
difficult. It is poorly understood which, if any, of the currently available
machine learning algorithms will best predict new candidate drugs. 25 publicly
available molecular datasets were extracted from ChEMBL. Neural nets, random
forests, support vector machines (regression) and ridge regression were then
fitted to the structure-activity data. A new validation method, based on
quantile splits on the activity distribution function, is proposed for the
construction of training and testing sets. Model validation based on random
partitioning of available data favours models which overfit and `memorize' the
training set, namely random forests and deep neural nets. Partitioning based on
quantiles of the activity distribution correctly penalizes models which can
extrapolate onto structurally different molecules outside of the training data.
This approach favours more constrained models, namely ridge regression and
support vector regression. In addition, our new rank-based loss functions give
considerably different results from mean squared error highlighting the
necessity to define model optimality with respect to the decision task at hand.
Model performance should be evaluated from a decision theoretic perspective
with subjective loss functions. Data-splitting based on the separation of high
and low activity data provides a robust methodology for determining the best
extrapolating model. Simpler, traditional statistical methods such as ridge
regression outperform state-of-the-art machine learning methods in this

healthcare, in particular if they can be measured early compared to the

benefit. Bivariate meta-analysis methods can be used to evaluate surrogate
endpoints and to predict the treatment effect on the final outcome from the
treatment effect measured on a surrogate endpoint. However, candidate surrogate
endpoints are often imperfect, and the level of association between the
treatment effects on the surrogate and final outcomes may vary between
treatments. This imposes a limitation on the pairwise methods which do not
differentiate between the treatments. We develop bivariate network
meta-analysis (bvNMA) methods which combine data on treatment effects on the
surrogate and final outcomes, from trials investigating heterogeneous treatment
contrasts. The bvNMA methods estimate the effects on both outcomes for all
treatment contrasts individually in a single analysis. At the same time, they
allow us to model the surrogacy patterns across multiple trials (different
populations) within a treatment contrast and across treatment contrasts, thus
enabling predictions of the treatment effect on the final outcome for a new
study in a new population or investigating a new treatment. Modelling
assumptions about the between-studies heterogeneity and the network
consistency, and their impact on predictions, are investigated using simulated
data and an illustrative example in advanced colorectal cancer. When the
strength of the surrogate relationships varies across treatment contrasts,
bvNMA has the advantage of identifying treatments for which surrogacy holds,

coupling and energy distance from the Fermi level to the delocalized wire's
HOMO (LUMO) level. Special attention is payed to derivation of explicit
analytic expressions for the tunneling current using different approximations.
It is shown that if terminal units play barrier's role in the charge
transmission process, the best correspondence with the observed current-voltage
characteristics is achieved with the simplest Gauss and the mean-value explicit
forms. This is supported by comparison of the theory with experimental data
concerning the current-voltage characteristics of $N-$alkanedithiol chain.

  system","16 pages in double line spacing, 14 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown, using density matrix calculation, that high precision
two-dimensional (2D) atom localization in V-type system can be achieved by
applying an additional microwave coupling field between the excited states. In
the present scheme, two lasers, probe and pump, form a V-type system by
coupling the ground state to the excited states while an additional 2D standing
microwave field is used to couple the excited states. The solutions of the
density matrix equations reveal that the off-diagonal density matrix element
$\rho_{31}$, which signify the coherence between the states connected by the
probe laser, is position dependent. As the imaginary part of $\rho_{31}$ is
proportional to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, the probe absorption
also becomes position dependent and in this situation one can readily obtain
information about the atom position from the probe absorption spectra. Perfect
2D atom localization can be achieved by carefully selecting different system
parameters such as detuning, relative phase, dephasing and field strength. It
is found that the atom localization is highly dependent on the probe and
coupling field detuning values. In view of this, a systematic study is
performed on the system parameters and different zones have been identified
which give rise to different absorption shapes, e.g. ""dip"", ""wall"", ""peak"" as
well as negative absorption or amplification. Probe absorption spectrum is also
found to be dependent on relative phase between the applied fields. The
dependence of the dephasing parameter on the probe absorption is investigated
and found to be detrimental to atom localization. The effect of the microwave
coupling strength on ""wall"" type absorption shape is also studied and the
results are discussed. Finally, a possible practical realization of the present
scheme is discussed in Conclusion section.

may use Interplanetary Laser Ranging (ILR) as a tracking observable. Two-way
ILR will provide range data that are about 2 orders of magnitude more accurate
than radio-based range data. ILR does not produce Doppler data, however. In
this article, we compare the relative strength of radio Doppler and laser range
data for the retrieval of parameters of interest in planetary missions, to
clarify and quantify the science case of ILR, with a focus on geodetic
observables.
  We first provide an overview of the near-term attainable quality of ILR, in
terms of both the realization of the observable and the models used to process
the measurements. Subsequently, we analyze the sensitivity of radio-Doppler and
laser-range measurements in representative mission scenarios. We use both an
analytical approximation and numerical analyses of the relative sensitivity of
ILR and radio Doppler observables for more general cases.
  We show that mm-precise range normal points are feasible for ILR, but
mm-level accuracy and stability is unlikely to be attained, due to a
combination of instrumental and model errors. ILR has the potential for
superior performance in observing signatures in the data with a characteristic
period of greater than 0.33-1.65 hours This indicates that Doppler tracking
will typically remain the method of choice for gravity field determination and
spacecraft orbit determination in planetary missions. Laser ranging data,
however, are shown to have a significant advantage for the retrieval of
rotational and tidal characteristics from landers. Similarly, laser ranging

and many animal species show evidence of emotions in their behavior. Therefore,
emotions must be related to powerful mechanisms that aid survival, and,
emotions must be evolutionary continuous phenomena. How and why did emotions
evolve in nature, how do events get emotionally appraised, how do emotions
relate to cognitive complexity, and, how do they impact behavior and learning?
In this article I propose that all emotions are manifestations of reward
processing, in particular Temporal Difference (TD) error assessment.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful computational model for the learning
of goal oriented tasks by exploration and feedback. Evidence indicates that
RL-like processes exist in many animal species. Key in the processing of
feedback in RL is the notion of TD error, the assessment of how much better or
worse a situation just became, compared to what was previously expected (or,
the estimated gain or loss of utility - or well-being - resulting from new
evidence). I propose a TDRL Theory of Emotion and discuss its ramifications for
our understanding of emotions in humans, animals and machines, and present
psychological, neurobiological and computational evidence in its support.

underestimates the average GME size by at least a factor of two. The BCC200
overestimates the GME concentration by approximately 20% while the EDAC
overestimates the concentration by nearly one order of magnitude. Nevertheless,
the calculated total GME volume is only over-predicted by a factor 2 since the
EDAC underestimates the actual GME size. For the BCC200, the total GME volume
was over-predicted by 25 times due to the over-estimation of GME size. The
measured errors in the absolute sizing/counting of GME do not imply that all
results obtained using the bubble counters are insignificant or invalid. A
relative change in bubble size or bubble concentration can accurately be
measured. However, care must be taken in the interpretation of the results and
their absolute values. Moreover, the devices cannot be used interchangeably

been proposed as a new class of compact stars. We use the two-particle
irreducible effective action to leading order in the $1/N$-expansion to
describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the
parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation
of charged pions is exactly at $\mu_I=m_{\pi}$, where $\mu_I$ is the isospin
chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of
state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations.
Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars.
Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the
pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare
our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement.
The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the
corresponding radii are of the order of $10^5$ km.

  circuits with a cost on reliability",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural responses in the cortex change over time both systematically, due to
ongoing plasticity and learning, and seemingly randomly, due to various sources
of noise and variability. Most previous work considered each of these
processes, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural
networks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence
of powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical
unsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their
inputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for
neural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This
cost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but
inaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite
the learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff
by developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented
samples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would
result from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an
analytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the
cost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian
inference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads
to the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as
networks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through
multi-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide
insights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of
sampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep
learning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision
computing systems.

of measures) extremal with respect to the selected functional such as physical
measures, ergodic measures, atomic measures (corresponding to, e.g., periodic

infinite-dimensional LP is then approximated using a standard hierarchy of
finite-dimensional semidefinite programming problems (SDPs), the solutions of

than introducing self interaction vertices of the gravitational fields to the

since it is well known that addition of the self interaction terms necessarily
breaks the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry that PM gravity theory enjoys. For the
coupling with matter fields, we consider two different types of interaction
vertices. The first one is given by an interaction Lagrangian density,
$\mathcal L_{int}\sim h_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the PM
gravity field and $T^{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor of the matter
fields. To retain the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, the matter fields also transform
accordingly and it turns out that the transform must be non-local in this case.
The second type interaction is obtained by employing a gauge covariant
derivative with the PM gravity field, where the PM gravity fields play a role
of a gauge connection canceling the phase shift of the matter fields. We also
study the actions and the equations of motion of the partially massless gravity
fields. As expected, it shows 4 unitary degrees of freedom. 2 of them are
traceless tensor modes and they are light like fields. The other 2 are
transverse vector modes and their dispersion relation changes as background
space time (de Sitter) evolutes. In the very early time, they are light like
but in the very late time, their velocity become a half of speed of light. The
vector mode dispersion relation shows momentum dependent behavior. In fact, the

the (pre-change) distribution is known, but when the process becomes abnormal
there is a parametric uncertainty, i.e., the post-change (out-of-control)
distribution is known only partially up to a parameter. Both the change point
and the post-change parameter are unknown. Moreover, the change affects an
unknown subset of streams, so that the number of affected streams and their
location are unknown in advance. A good changepoint detection procedure should
detect the change as soon as possible after its occurrence while controlling
for a risk of false alarms. We consider a Bayesian setup with a given prior
distribution of the change point and propose two sequential mixture-based
change detection rules, one mixes a Shiryaev-type statistic over both the
unknown subset of affected streams and the unknown post-change parameter and
another mixes a Shiryaev-Roberts-type statistic. These rules generalize the
mixture detection procedures studied by Tartakovsky (2018) in a single-stream
case. We provide sufficient conditions under which the proposed multistream
change detection procedures are first-order asymptotically optimal with respect
to moments of the delay to detection as the probability of false alarm
approaches zero.

typical for intermediate temperature dwarfs (effective temperature is in the
range from approximately 5800 to 6100 K, surface garvity is from 3.6 to 4.5,
metallicity is from about -1 to -2.6 dex). We obtained a good agreement between
abundance from these two sets of the lines, and this testifies about
reliability of our NLTE copper atomic model. We confirmed that no underabundace
of this element is seen at low metallicities (the mean [Cu/Fe] value is about
-0.2 dex, while as it follows from the previous LTE studies copper behaves as a
secondary element and [Cu/Fe] ratio in the range of [Fe/H from -2 to -3 dex
should be about -1 dex). According to our NLTE data the copper behaves as a
primary element at low metallicity regime. We also conclude that our new NLTE
copper abundance in metal-poor stars requires significant reconsideration of

optical fibers. This is particularly acute for Inhibited-Coupling guiding
fibers because of the reliance of their core guidance on the core and cladding
mode-field overlap integral. Consequently, careful planning of the fiber
cladding parameters allows obtaining fibers with optimized characteristics such
as low loss and broad transmission bandwidth. In this manuscript, we report on
how one can tailor the modal properties of hollow-core photonic crystal fibers
by adequately modifying the fiber cladding. We show that the alteration of the
position of the unity-tubes in the cladding of tubular fibers can alter the
loss hierarchy of the modes in these fibers, and exhibit salient polarization
propriety. In this context, we present two fibers with different cladding
structures which favor propagation of higher order core modes - namely LP11 and
LP21 modes. Additionally, we provide discussions on mode transformations in
these fibers and show that one can obtain uncommon intensity and polarization
profiles at the fiber output. This allows the fiber to act as a mode intensity
and polarization shaper. We envisage this novel concept can be useful for a
variety of applications such as hollow core fiber based atom optics,
atom-surface physics, sensing and nonlinear optics.

are separately constructed in a primary embedding space, and then combined as
an input to feed-forward layers to transform to a canonical embedding space
which we discover more stable than the primary one. Experimental results show
that given a very short utterance, the proposed model can efficiently recover
high quality target speech from a mixture, which outperforms various baseline

asymptotic theory of changepoint detection for non-i.i.d.\ stochastic models,
assuming the certain stability of the log-likelihood ratio process, in the case
of simple hypotheses when both pre-change and post-change models are completely
specified. However, in most applications, the post-change distribution is not
completely known. In the present paper, we generalize previous results to the
case of parametric uncertainty, assuming the parameter of the post-change

the Mixture Shiryaev rule and the Mixture Shiryaev--Roberts rule -- and study
their asymptotic properties in the Bayesian context. In particular, we provide
sufficient conditions under which these rules are first-order asymptotically
optimal, minimizing moments of the delay to detection as the probability of

dianonic enol-2) of oxyluciferin (OxyLuc), which are the most probable emitters
responsible for the firefly bioluminescence, have been fully relaxed at the
variational Monte Carlo (VMC) level. Absorption energies of the S1<-S0 vertical
transition have been computed using different levels of theory, such as TDDFT,
CC2 and many body Green's function Theory (MBGFT). The use of MBGFT, by means
of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism, on VMC structures provides results in
excellent agreement with the value (2.26(8) eV) obtained by action spectroscopy
experiments for the keto-1 form (2.32 eV). To unravel the role of the quality
of the optimized ground state geometry, BS excitation energies have also been
computed on CASSCF geometries, inducing a non negligible blue shift (0.08 and
0.07 eV for keto-1 and enol-1 forms, respectively) with respect to the VMC
ones. Structural effects have been analyzed in terms of over- or
under-correlation along the conjugated bonds of OxyLuc by using different
methods for the ground-state optimization. The relative stability of the S$_1$
state for the keto-1 and enol-1 forms depends on the method chosen for the
excited state calculation, thus representing a fundamental caveat for any
theoretical study on these systems. Finally, Kohn-Sham HOMO and LUMO orbitals
of enol-2 are (nearly) bound only when the dianion is embedded into a solvent
(water and toluene in the present work); excited state calculations are
therefore meaningful only in presence of a dielectric medium which localizes
the electronic density. The combination of VMC for the ground state geometry
and BS formalism for the absorption spectra clearly outperforms standard TDDFT
and quantum chemistry approaches.

  for asymmetries in visual perspective",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent debates over adults' theory of mind use have been fueled by surprising
failures of perspective-taking in communication, suggesting that
perspective-taking can be relatively effortful. How, then, should speakers and
listeners allocate their resources to achieve successful communication? We
begin with the observation that this shared goal induces a natural division of
labor: the resources one agent chooses to allocate toward perspective-taking
should depend on their expectations about the other's allocation. We formalize
this idea in a resource-rational model augmenting recent probabilistic
weighting accounts with a mechanism for (costly) control over the degree of
perspective-taking. In a series of simulations, we first derive an intermediate
degree of perspective weighting as an optimal tradeoff between expected costs
and benefits of perspective-taking. We then present two behavioral experiments
testing novel predictions of our model. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the
presence or absence of occlusions in a director-matcher task and found that
speakers spontaneously produced more informative descriptions to account for
""known unknowns"" in their partner's private view. In Experiment 2, we compared
the scripted utterances used by confederates in prior work with those produced
in interactions with unscripted directors. We found that confederates were
systematically less informative than listeners would initially expect given the
presence of occlusions, but listeners used violations to adaptively make fewer
errors over time. Taken together, our work suggests that people are not simply
""mindblind""; they use contextually appropriate expectations to navigate the
division of labor with their partner. We discuss how a resource rational
framework may provide a more deeply explanatory foundation for understanding
flexible perspective-taking under processing constraints.

pulsar (MSP) with a white dwarf (WD) companion. Positive correlations between
the orbital period $P_{\rm b}$ and eccentricity $\epsilon$ are found in two
classes of MSP binaries with a He WD and with a CO/ONeMg WD, though their
trends are different. The distribution of $P_{\rm b}$ is not uniform.
Deficiency of sources at $P_{\rm b}\sim35-50$~days (Gap 1) have been mentioned
in previous studies. On the other hand, another gap at $P_{\rm
b}\sim2.5-4.5$~days (Gap 2) is identified for the first time. Inspection of the
relation between $P_{\rm b}$ and the companion masses $M_{\rm c}$ revealed the
subpopulations of MSP binaries with a He WD separated by Gap 1, above which
$P_{\rm b}$ is independent of $M_{\rm c}$ (horizontal branch) but below which
$P_{\rm b}$ correlates strongly with $M_{\rm c}$ (lower branch). Distinctive
horizontal branch and lower branch separated by Gap 2 were identified for the
MSP binaries with a CO/ONeMg WD at shorter $P_{\rm b}$ and higher $M_{\rm c}$.
Generally, $M_{\rm c}$ are higher in the horizontal branch than in the lower
branch for the MSP binaries with a He WD. These properties can be explained in
terms of a binary orbital evolution scenario in which the WD companion was
ablated by a pulsar wind in the post mass-transfer phase.

one-dimensional Bose gas in an optical lattice from an{\it {ab initio}}
perspective by solving the time-dependent many-boson Schr\""odinger equation
using the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons
(MCTDHB). We direct a superfluid (SF) to Mott-insulator (MI) transition by
performing two independent quenches: an interaction quench when the interaction
strength is changed instantaneously, and a lattice depth quench where the depth
of the lattice is altered suddenly. We show that although the Bose-Hubbard
model predicts identical physics, the general many-body treatment shows
significant differences between the two cases. We observe that lattice depth
quench exhibits a large time-scale to reach the MI state and shows an
oscillatory phase collapse-revival dynamics and a complete absence of
thermalization that reveals through the analysis of the time-evolution of the
reduced one-body density matrix, two-body density, and entropy production. In
contrast, the interaction quench shows a swift transition to the MI state and
shows a clear signature of thermalization for strong quench values. We provide
a physical explanation for these differences and prescribe an analytical
fitting formula for the time required for thermalization.

of the S1 stream on WIMP and axion detectors as a function of the density of
its unmeasured dark component. In WIMP detectors the S1 stream supplies more
high energy nuclear recoils so will marginally improve DM detection prospects.
We find that even if S1 comprises less than 10% of the local density, multi-ton
xenon WIMP detectors can distinguish the S1 stream from the bulk halo in the
relatively narrow mass range between 5 and 25 GeV. In directional WIMP
detectors such as CYGNUS, S1 increases DM detection prospects more
substantially since it enhances the anisotropy of the WIMP signal. Finally, we
show that axion haloscopes possess by far the greatest potential sensitivity to
the S1 stream. Once the axion mass has been discovered, the distinctive

multiband model, which is relevant for describing the low-energy properties of
some iron-chalcogenide superconducting materials. Crucial ingredients in this
analysis are the calculation of higher-order contributions in the RG scheme
that go beyond the widely-used parquet approximation and the consequent
inclusion of nontrivial self-energy effects of the model that yield an
anisotropic renormalization of the quasiparticle weight in the system. The
motivation of our work is the experimental discovery by Sprau et al. (2017)
that orbitally-selective renormalization of the quasiparticle weight in the
Hund's metal phase at moderate temperatures underpins the highly unusual gap in
the superconducting phase of the FeSe compound at lower temperatures. One
prediction we arrive here is that the underlying origin of nematicity in these
systems may indeed come from orbital-selectivity, instead of a Pomeranchuk
instability in the $d_{\pm}$ channel. This orbital selectivity is driven by the
presence of stripe-type antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the model. Therefore,
we argue that the present RG results may provide a scenario from a
weak-to-moderate coupling perspective, in which the role of orbital selectivity
to describe the physical properties of some iron-chalcogenide superconductors
is emphasized.

which should be respected by numerical schemes in order to predict correctly
the solution over a long time period. In this paper, the long-time behaviour of
momentum and actions for energy-preserving methods is analysed for semilinear

by firstly using a spectral semi-discretisation in space and then by applying
the adopted average vector field (AAVF) method in time. This numerical scheme
can exactly preserve the energy of the semi-discrete system. The main theme of
this paper is to analyse another important physical property of the scheme. It
is shown that this scheme yields near conservation of a modified momentum and
modified actions over long times. Both the results are rigorously proved based
on the technique of modulated Fourier expansions in two stages. First a
multi-frequency modulated Fourier expansion of the AAVF method is constructed
and then two almost-invariants of the modulation system are derived.

internal evolution of a magnetar. We allow the relation between the poloidal
and toroidal stream functions - that characterizes the magnetosphere - to
evolve freely without constraining its particular form. We find that, on
time-scales of the order of kyr, the energy stored in the magnetosphere
gradually increases, as the toroidal region grows and the field lines expand
outwards. This continues until a critical point is reached beyond which
force-free solutions for the magnetosphere can no longer be constructed, likely
leading to some large-scale magnetospheric reorganization. The energy budget
available for such events can be as high as several $10^{45}\,$erg for fields
of $10^{14}\,$G. Subsequently, starting from the new initial conditions, the
evolution proceeds in a similar manner. The time-scale to reach the critical
point scales inversely with the magnetic field amplitude. Allowing currents to
pass through the last few meters below the surface, where the magnetic
diffusivity is orders of magnitude larger than in the crust, should give rise
to a considerable amount of energy deposition through Joule heating. We
estimate that the effective surface temperature could increase locally from
$\sim 0.1\,$keV to $\sim 0.3 - 0.6\,$keV, in good agreement with observations.
Similarly, the power input from the interior into the magnetosphere could be as
high as $10^{35} - 10^{36}\,$erg/s, which is consistent with peak luminosities
observed during magnetar outbursts. Therefore, a detailed treatment of currents
flowing through the envelope may be needed to explain the thermal properties of
magnetars.

the Tracy-Widom GUE and the Gumbel distributions. We also define and prove

where in the first stage, a spatially uniform, precessing magnetization is
created via passage through a resonance followed by a self-phase-locking
(autoresonance) with a constant amplitude drive. In the second stage, the
passage trough an additional resonance with a spatial modulation of the driving
amplitude yields transformation of the uniform solution into a doubly
phase-locked standing wave, whose amplitude is controlled by the variation of
the driving frequency. The stability of this excitation process is analyzed
both numerically and via Whitham's averaged variational principle.

the vertices such that $v_i$ has at least one neighbour in $\{v_1, \ldots, v_{i
- 1}\}$ for every $i \in \{2, \ldots, n\}$. A connected greedy coloring (CGC
for short) is a coloring obtained by applying the greedy algorithm to a
connected ordering. This has been first introduced in 1989 by Hertz and de
Werra, but still very little is known about this problem. An interesting aspect
is that, contrary to the traditional greedy coloring, it is not always true
that a graph has a connected ordering that produces an optimal coloring; this
motivates the definition of the connected chromatic number of $G$, which is the
smallest value $\chi_c(G)$ such that there exists a CGC of $G$ with $\chi_c(G)$
colors. An even more interesting fact is that $\chi_c(G) \le \chi(G)+1$ for
every graph $G$ (Benevides et. al. 2014).
  In this paper, in the light of the dichotomy for the coloring problem
restricted to $H$-free graphs given by Kr\'al et.al. in 2001, we are interested
in investigating the problems of, given an $H$-free graph $G$: (1). deciding
whether $\chi_c(G)=\chi(G)$; and (2). given also a positive integer $k$,
deciding whether $\chi_c(G)\le k$. We have proved that Problem (2) has the same
dichotomy as the coloring problem (i.e., it is polynomial when $H$ is an
induced subgraph of $P_4$ or of $P_3+K_1$, and it is NP-complete otherwise). As
for Problem (1), we have proved that $\chi_c(G) = \chi(G)$ always hold when $G$
is an induced subgraph of $P_5$ or of $P_4+K_1$, and that it is NP-hard to
decide whether $\chi_c(G)=\chi(G)$ when $H$ is not a linear forest or contains
an induced $P_9$. We mention that some of the results actually involve fixed
$k$ and fixed $\chi(G)$.

empirically as well as in a simulation study, considering odds-ratio and risk
ratio effect sizes.
  Empirically, a majority of the identified meta-analyses include only 2
studies. In the simulation study, coverage probability is, in the presence of
heterogeneity and few studies, below the nominal level for all frequentist
methods based on normal approximation, in particular when sizes in
meta-analyses are not balanced, but improve when confidence intervals are
adjusted. Bayesian methods result in better coverage than the frequentist
methods with normal approximation in all scenarios. Credible intervals are
empirically and in the simulation study wider than unadjusted confidence
intervals, but considerably narrower than adjusted ones. Confidence intervals
based on the generalized linear mixed models are in general, slightly narrower
than those from other frequentist methods. Certain methods turned out
impractical due to frequent numerical problems.
  In the presence of between-study heterogeneity, especially with unbalanced
study sizes, caution is needed in applying meta-analytical methods to few
studies, as either coverage probabilities might be compromised, or intervals
are inconclusively wide. Bayesian estimation with a sensibly chosen prior for
between-trial heterogeneity may offer a promising compromise.

active relationships (friendly or hostile) to establish a hierarchy between
four different types of triadic relationships. The lack of an active link also
provides information about the network. To exploit the information that remains
uncovered by structural balance, we introduce the inactive relationship that
accounts for both neutral and nonexistent ties between two agents. This
addition results in ten types of triads, with the advantage that the network
analysis can be done with complete networks. To each type of triadic
relationship, we assign an energy that is a measure for its average occupation
probability. Finite temperatures account for a persistent form of disorder in
the formation of the triadic relationships. We propose a Hamiltonian with three
interaction terms and a chemical potential (capturing the cost of edge
activation) as an underlying model for the triadic energy levels. Our model is
suitable for empirical analysis of political networks and allows to uncover
generative mechanisms. It is tested on an extended data set for the standings
between two classes of alliances in a massively multi-player on-line game
(MMOG) and on real-world data for the relationships between countries during
the Cold War era. We find emergent properties in the triadic relationships
between the nodes in a political network. For example, we observe a persistent
hierarchy between the ten triadic energy levels across time and networks. In
addition, the analysis reveals consistency in the extracted model parameters
and a universal data collapse of a derived combination of global properties of
the networks. We illustrate that the model has predictive power for the
transition probabilities between the different triadic states.

imposing a suitable energy cutoff on a quantum particle in D dimensions subject
to a confining potential well V(r) with a very sharp minimum on the sphere of
radius r=1; furthermore, the cutoff and the depth of the well depend on (and
diverge with) a natural number L. The commutator of the coordinates depends
only on the angular momentum, as in Snyder noncommutative spaces. When L
diverges, the Hilbert space dimension diverges, too; S^d_L converges to S^d,
and we recover ordinary quantum mechanics on S^d. These models might be useful
in quantum field theory, quantum gravity or condensed matter physics.

black holes based on complex angular momentum techniques (analytic continuation
of partial wave expansions, duality of the ${\cal S}$-matrix and effective
resummations involving its Regge poles and the associated residues, Regge
trajectories, semiclassical interpretations, etc.). Such techniques, which
proved to be very helpful in various areas of physics to describe and analyze
resonant scattering, were only marginally used in the context of black hole
physics. Here, by considering the multipolar waveform generated by a massive
particle falling radially from infinity into a Schwarzschild black hole, we
show that they could play a fundamental role in gravitational-wave physics.
More precisely, from the multipole expansion defining the Weyl scalar $\Psi_4$,
we extract the Fourier transform of a sum over Regge poles and their residues
which can be evaluated numerically from the associated Regge trajectories. This
Regge pole approximation permits us to reconstruct, for an arbitrary direction
of observation, a large part of the multipolar waveform $\Psi_4$. In
particular, it can reproduce with very good agreement the quasinormal ringdown
as well as with rather good agreement the tail of the signal. This is achieved
even if we take into account only one Regge pole and, if a large number of
modes are excited, the result can be improved by considering additional poles.
Moreover, while quasinormal-mode contributions do not provide physically
relevant results at ""early times"" due to their exponentially divergent behavior
as time decreases, it is not necessary to determine from physical
considerations a starting time for the Regge ringdown.

phenomenon. The bending angle depends on the stellar compactness, which is the
ratio of stellar mass $M$ to radius $R$. In this paper, we investigate the
pulse profile of highly compact rotating neutron stars for which the bending
angle exceeds $\pi/2$. When $M/R > 0.284$ (the bending angle becomes equal to
$\pi/2$ for the stellar model with $M/R=0.284$), such a large bending happens,
resulting in that a photon emitted from any position on the stellar surface can
reach an observer. First, we classify the parameter plane of inclination angle
$i$ and angle $\Theta$ between the rotation axis and the normal on the hot spot
by the number of photon paths reaching the observer. Then, we estimate the
time-dependent flux of photons emitted from two hot spots on the rotating
neutron star, associated with the magnetic polar caps, for various combinations
of $i$ and $\Theta$, and for two values of compactness, assuming that the
stellar rotation is not so fast that the frame dragging and the stellar
deformation are negligible. As the result, we find that the pulse profiles of
highly compact neutron stars are qualitatively different from those for the
standard neutron stars. In particular, the ratio of the maximum observed flux
to the minimum one is significantly larger than that for the standard neutron
stars. This study suggests that one would be able to constrain the equation of
state for neutron stars through the observation of pulse profile with angles
$i$ and $\Theta$ determined by other methods.

order to avoid the high cost of full supervision, we propose to use a diverse
data set, which consists of two types of annotations: (i) a small number of
images are labeled using the expensive ground-truth pose; and (ii) other images
are labeled using the inexpensive action label. As action information helps
narrow down the pose of a human, we argue that this approach can help reduce
the cost of training without significantly affecting the accuracy. To
demonstrate this we design a probabilistic framework that employs two
distributions: (i) a conditional distribution to model the uncertainty over the
human pose given the image and the action; and (ii) a prediction distribution,
which provides the pose of an image without using any action information. We
jointly estimate the parameters of the two aforementioned distributions by
minimizing their dissimilarity coefficient, as measured by a task-specific loss
function. During both training and testing, we only require an efficient
sampling strategy for both the aforementioned distributions. This allows us to
use deep probabilistic networks that are capable of providing accurate pose
estimates for previously unseen images. Using the MPII data set, we show that
our approach outperforms baseline methods that either do not use the diverse
annotations or rely on pointwise estimates of the pose.

Erd{\""o}s-R{\'e}nyi $G(N,p)$ random graph in the large $N$ limit, is a
well-known example of a simple problem for which finding any approximate
solution within a factor of $2$ of the known, probabilistically determined
limit, appears to require P$=$NP. This type of search has practical importance
in very large graphs. Algorithmic approaches run into phase boundaries long
before they reach the size of the largest likely solutions. And, most
intriguing, there is an extensive literature of \textit{challenges} posed for
concrete methods of finding maximum naturally occurring as well as artificially
hidden cliques, with computational costs that are at most polynomial in the
size of the problem.
  We use the probabilistic approach in a novel way to provide a more insightful
test of constructive algorithms for this problem. We show that extensions of
existing methods of greedy local search will be able to meet the
\textit{challenges} for practical problems of size $N$ as large as $10^{10}$
and perhaps more. Experiments with spectral methods that treat a single large
clique of size $\alpha N^{1/2}$ \textit{planted} in the graph as an impurity
level in a tight binding energy band show that such a clique can be detected
when $\alpha \geq \approx1.0$. Belief propagation using a recent
\textit{approximate message passing} (\textbf{AMP}) scheme of inference pushes
this limit down to $\alpha \sim \sqrt{1/e}$. Exhaustive local search (with
early stopping when the planted clique is found) does even better on problems
of practical size, and proves to be the fastest solution method for this
problem.

single-particle level, the evolution is driven by incoherent interaction
between the particles, which may be effectively modeled by a noise, leading to
a Brownian-like dynamics of the momentum. Because this self-generated diffusion

emerges, in agreement with numerics.

case of smooth, periodically distributed inclusions with touching boundaries),
we prove that in an open neighbourhood of the set of rotations, the multi-cell
homogenization formula of non-convex homogenization reduces to a single-cell

detect CO emission in 12 of the galaxies at >4sigma significance, with
molecular gas masses in the range 0.01-6x10^8 Msol, as well as CO in absorption
in the non-dominant group member galaxy NGC 5354. In total 21 of the 53 CLoGS
dominant galaxies are detected in CO and we confirm our previous findings that
they have low star formation rates (0.01-1 Msol/yr) but short depletion times
(<1Gyr) implying rapid replenishment of their gas reservoirs. Comparing
molecular gas mass with radio luminosity, we find that a much higher fraction
of our group-dominant galaxies (60+-16%) are AGN-dominated than is the case for
the general population of ellipticals, but that there is no clear connection
between radio luminosity and the molecular gas mass. Using data from the
literature, we find that at least 27 of the 53 CLoGS dominant galaxies contain
HI, comparable to the fraction of nearby non-cluster early type galaxies
detected in HI and significantly higher that the fraction in the Virgo cluster.
We see no correlation between the presence of an X-ray detected intra-group
medium and molecular gas in the dominant galaxy, but find that the HI-richest
galaxies are located in X-ray faint groups. Morphological data from the
literature suggests the cold gas component most commonly takes the form of a
disk, but many systems show evidence of galaxy-galaxy interactions, indicating
that they may have acquired their gas through stripping or mergers. We provide
improved molecular gas mass estimates for two galaxies previously identified as
being in the centres of cooling flows, NGC 4636 and NGC 5846, and find that
they are relatively molecular gas poor compared to our other detected systems.

$N$. At each birth event, with probability $1-\rho_N R$ the offspring copies
one parent's chromosome, and with probability $\rho_N R$ she inherits a
chromosome that is a mosaic of both parental chromosomes. We assume that at
time $0$ each individual has her chromosome painted in a different color and we
study the color partition of the chromosome that is asymptotically fixed in a
large population, when we look at a portion of the chromosome such that $\rho
:= \lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{\rho_N N}{2}\to \infty$. To do so, we follow
backwards in time the ancestry of the chromosome of a randomly sampled
individual. This yields a Markov process valued in the color partitions of the
half-line, that was introduced by Esser et al. (2016), in which blocks can
merge and split, called the partitioning process. Its stationary distribution
is closely related to the fixed chromosome in our Moran model with
recombination. We are able to provide an approximation of this stationary
distribution when $\rho \gg 1$ and an error bound. This allows us to show that
the distribution of the (renormalised) length of the leftmost block of the
partition (i.e. the region of the chromosome that carries the same color as 0)
converges to an exponential distribution. In addition, the geometry of this
block can be described in terms of a Poisson point process with an explicit
intensity measure.

them to produce unfit daughters. Here, we extend previous theory by
investigating the evolution of female mate choice in a spatially explicit

female preferences for high-condition males or even cause a preference for

We investigate small-amplitude light variations in FU Ori occurring
in timescales of days and weeks.
  Aims. We seek to determine the mechanisms that lead to these light changes.
  Methods. The visual light curve of FU Ori gathered by the MOST satellite
continuously for 55 days in the 2013-2014 winter season and simultaneously
obtained ground-based multi-colour data were compared with the results from a
disc and star light synthesis model.
  Results. Hotspots on the star are not responsible for the majority of
observed light variations. Instead, we found that the long periodic family of
10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag
may arise owing to the rotational revolution of disc inhomogeneities located
between 16-20 solar radii. The same distance is obtained by assuming that these
light variations arise because of a purely Keplerian revolution of these
inhomogeneities for a stellar mass of 0.7 solar mass. The short-periodic
(3-1.38 d) small amplitude (0.01 mag) light variations show a clear sign of
period shortening, similar to what was discovered in the first MOST
observations of FU Ori. Our data indicate that these short-periodic
oscillations may arise because of changing visibility of plasma tongues (not
included in our model), revolving in the magnetospheric gap and/or likely
related hotspots as well.
  Conclusions. Results obtained for the long-periodic 10-11 d family of light
variations appear to be roughly in line with the colour-period relation, which
assumes that longer periods are produced by more external and cooler parts of
the disc. Coordinated observations in a broad spectral range are still
necessary to fully understand the nature of the short-periodic 1-3 d family of
light variations and their period changes.

indirect semiconducting behavior of PbI 2 is strongly influenced by the number
of layers. We find that at 3L-thickness there is a direct-to-indirect band gap
transition (from bulk-to-monolayer). It is shown that in the Raman spectrum two
prominent peaks, A 1g and E g , exhibit phonon hardening with increasing number
of layers due to the inter-layer van der Waals interaction. Moreover, the Raman
activity of the A 1g mode significantly increases with increasing number of
layers due to the enhanced out-of-plane dielectric constant in the few-layer
case. We further characterize rigid-layer vibrations of low-frequency
inter-layer shear (C) and breathing (LB) modes in few-layer PbI 2 . A reduced
mono-atomic (linear) chain model (LCM) provides a fairly accurate picture of

also known as the q-space, to adequately capture the pattern of water diffusion
in various directions and scales. As a result, the acquisition time can be
prohibitive for individuals who are unable to stay still in the scanner for an
extensive period of time, such as infants. To address this problem, in this
paper we harness non-local self-similar information in the x-q space of
diffusion MRI data for q-space upsampling. Specifically, we first perform
neighborhood matching to establish the relationships of signals in x-q space.
The signal relationships are then used to regularize an ill-posed inverse
problem related to the estimation of high angular resolution diffusion MRI data
from its low-resolution counterpart. Our framework allows information from
curved white matter structures to be used for effective regularization of the
otherwise ill-posed problem. Extensive evaluations using synthetic and infant
diffusion MRI data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with
the widely adopted interpolation methods using spherical radial basis functions
and spherical harmonics, our method is able to produce high angular resolution
diffusion MRI data with greater quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

regularized optimization problems with block-separable structure. Existing
methods have several limitations. They often assume that subproblems can be
solved exactly at each iteration, which in practical terms usually restricts
the quadratic term in the subproblem to be diagonal, thus losing most of the
benefits of higher-order derivative information. Moreover, in contrast to the
smooth case, non-uniform sampling of the blocks has not yet been shown to
improve the convergence rate bounds for regularized problems. This work
proposes an inexact randomized BCD method based on a regularized quadratic
subproblem, in which the quadratic term can vary from iteration to iteration: a
""variable metric"". We provide a detailed convergence analysis for both convex
and nonconvex problems. Our analysis generalizes to the regularized case
Nesterov's proposal to improve convergence of BCD by sampling proportional to
the blockwise Lipschitz constants. We improve the convergence rate in the
convex case by weakening the dependency on the initial objective value.
Empirical results also show that significant benefits accrue from the use of a
variable metric.

confounding bias may be reduced through adjustment for a large number of
pre-treatment covariates, but positivity is less likely in analyses with
irrelevant predictors of treatment such as instrumental variables. Under
empirical positivity violations, propensity score weights are highly variable,
and doubly robust estimators suffer from high variance and large finite sample
bias. To solve this problem, we introduce the $e$-score, which is defined
through a dimension reduction for the propensity score. This dimension
reduction is based on a result known as collaborative double robustness, which
roughly states that a propensity score conditioning only on the bias of the
outcome regression estimator is sufficient to attain double robustness. We
propose methods to construct doubly robust estimators based on the $e$-score,
and discuss their properties such as consistency, efficiency, and asymptotic
distribution. This allows the construction of asymptotically valid Wald-type
confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We present an illustrative
application on estimating the effect of smoking on bone mineral content in
adolescent girls well as a synthetic data simulation illustrating the bias and
variance reduction and asymptotic normality achieved by our proposed
estimators.

the evolution of the distribution of species of mass $x$, where pairs of

We provide two natural probabilistic solutions of the latter IPDE and address
in detail the case when $\delta=0$. The first solution is expressed in terms of
a branching particle system where particles carry masses behaving as
independent continuous-state branching processes. The second one is the law of

Deriving an accurate facial appearance representation is a critical task for an

emphasizing the relationship between neighboring and reference pixels by
dividing them into two quadrilaterals in a local neighborhood. Thus, the
resultant gradient edges reveal the transitional variation information, that
improves the classification rate by discriminating expression classes.
Moreover, it also enhances the capability of the descriptor to deal with

noise elements to enhance the robustness to noisy conditions. The QUEST pattern
generates a six-bit compact code, which improves the efficiency of the FER

anisotropy can play a role in minimizing or even eliminating locking behaviour,
for moderate values of the ratio of Young's moduli in the fibre and transverse

formulation, involving under-integration of the volumetric and extensional

either a mixed or a perturbed Lagrangian formulation, analogously to the
well-known situation for the volumetric term. A set of numerical examples
confirms the locking-free behaviour in the near-incompressible limit of the

clearly evident in the case of near-inextensibility. On the other hand,
under-integration of the extensional term leads to extensional locking-free

cameras. The first stacked catalogue is called 3XMM-DR7s. It contains 71,951
unique sources with positions and parameters such as fluxes, hardness ratios,
quality estimates, and information on inter-observation variability. About 15%
of the sources are new with respect to 3XMM-DR7. Through stacked source
detection, the parameters of repeatedly observed sources can be determined with
higher accuracy than in the individual observations. The method is more
sensitive to faint sources and tends to produce fewer spurious detections. With
this first stacked catalogue we demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of the
approach. It supplements the large data base of XMM-Newton detections by
additional, in particular faint, sources and adds variability information. In
the future, the catalogue will be expanded to larger samples and continued
within the series of serendipitous XMM-Newton source catalogues.

the wave functions of the qubit at zero magnetic field. The g-matrix formalism
therefore provides the complete dependence of the Larmor and Rabi frequencies

also provides a compact model for the control of the qubit, and a simple

operations, the time evolution of the spins is governed by a finite range

Specifically, a set of encoders are recursively applied to group 3D objects

Lagrange dual of the constrained least-squares problem. The resulting problem
is a generalized LASSO problem which can be solved efficiently. It is a
relaxation in the sense that it can only be guaranteed to give a feasible
solution; not necessarily the optimal one. In exhaustive experiments on small
images (2x2, 3x3, 4x4) we find, however, that if the problem has a unique
solution, our dual approach finds it. In case of multiple solutions, our
approach finds the commonalities between the solutions. Further experiments on
realistic numerical phantoms and an experiment on X-ray dataset show that our
method compares favourably to Total Variation and DART.

information about the extreme local geometric nature of the set. The Assouad
dimension of a set has a measure theoretic analogue, which is also known as the
upper regularity dimension. One reason for the interest in this notion is that
a measure has finite Assouad dimension if and only if it is doubling.
  Motivated by recent progress on both the Assouad dimension of measures that
satisfy a strong separation condition and the quasi-Assouad dimension of metric
spaces, we introduce the notion of the quasi-Assouad dimension of a measure. As
with sets, the quasi-Assouad dimension of a measure is dominated by its Assouad
dimension. It dominates both the quasi-Assouad dimension of its support and the
supremal local dimension of the measure, with strict inequalities possible in
all cases.
  Our main focus is on self-similar measures in $\mathbb{R}$ whose support is
an interval and which may have `overlaps'. For measures that satisfy a weaker
condition than the weak separation condition we prove that finite quasi-Assouad
dimension is equivalent to quasi-doubling of the measure, a strictly less
restrictive property than doubling. Further, we exhibit a large class of such
measures for which the quasi-Assouad dimension coincides with the maximum of
the local dimension at the endpoints of the support. This class includes all
regular, equicontractive self-similar measures satisfying the weak separation
condition, such as convolutions of uniform Cantor measures with integer ratio
of dissection. Other properties of this dimension are also established and many
examples are given.

Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is carried out to investigate the dynamics of
the flow-field around a NACA-0012 aerofoil at a Reynolds number of $5\times
10^4$, Mach number of $0.4$, and at various angles of attack around the onset
of stall. Three distinct dominant flow modes are identified by the DMD and the
POD: 1) a globally oscillating flow mode at a low-frequency (LFO mode 1); 2) a
locally oscillating flow mode on the suction surface of the aerofoil at a
low-frequency (LFO mode 2); and 3) a locally oscillating flow mode along the
wake of the aerofoil at a high-frequency (HFO mode). The LFO mode 1 features
the globally oscillating-flow around the aerofoil, the oscillating-pressure
along the aerofoil chord, and the process that creates and sustains the triad
of vortices. The LFO mode 2 features the expansion and advection of the
upstream vortex (UV) of the TCV. The HFO mode originates at the aerofoil
leading-edge and features the oscillating mode along the aerofoil wake. The HFO
mode exists at all of the investigated angles of attack and causes a global
oscillation in the flow-field. The global flow oscillation around the aerofoil
interacts with the laminar portion of the separated shear layer in the vicinity
of the leading-edge and triggers an inviscid absolute instability that creates
and sustains the TCV. When the UV of the TCV expands, it advects downstream and
energies the HFO mode. The LFO mode 1, the LFO mode 2, and the HFO mode
mutually strengthen each other until the LFO mode 1 and 2 overtake the HFO mode
at the onset of stall. At the angles of attack $9.7^{\circ} \leq \alpha \leq
10.0^{\circ}$ the low-frequency flow oscillation (LFO) phenomenon is fully
developed. At higher angles of attack, the HFO mode overtakes the LFO mode 2,
and the aerofoil undergoes a full stall.

periodogram method for the sinusoidal model, to find initial values to use in
any iterative procedure to compute the least squares estimators (LSEs) of the
unknown parameters, to the 2-D chirp model. Next we propose an estimator, known
as the approximate least squares estimator (ALSE), that is obtained by
maximising a periodogram-type function and is observed to be asymptotically
equivalent to the LSE. Moreover the asymptotic properties of these estimators
are obtained under slightly mild conditions than those required for the LSEs.
For the multiple component 2-D chirp model, we propose a sequential method of
estimation of the ALSEs, that significantly reduces the computational
difficulty involved in reckoning the LSEs and the ALSEs. We perform some
simulation studies to see how the proposed method works and a data set has been

in today particle physics and cosmology. Beta or electron capture spectrum
end-point study is currently the only experimental method which can provide a
model independent measurement of the absolute scale of neutrino mass. HOLMES is
an experiment funded by the European Research Council to directly measure the
neutrino mass. HOLMES will perform a calorimetric measurement of the energy
released in the electron capture decay of the artificial isotope $^{163}$Ho. In
a calorimetric measurement the energy released in the decay process is entirely
contained into the detector, except for the fraction taken away by the
neutrino. This approach eliminates both the issues related to the use of an
external source and the systematic uncertainties arising from decays on excited
final states. The most suitable detectors for this type of measurement are low
temperature thermal detectors, where all the energy released into an absorber
is converted into a temperature increase that can be measured by a sensitive
thermometer directly coupled with the absorber. This measurement was originally
proposed in 1982 by A. De Rujula and M. Lusignoli, but only in the last decade
the technological progress in detectors development has allowed to design a
sensitive experiment. HOLMES plans to deploy a large array of low temperature
microcalorimeters with implanted $^{163}$Ho nuclei. In this contribution we
outline the HOLMES project with its physics reach and technical challenges,

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but is easily affected by flip ambiguities
because of measurement errors and flying motions. This study proposes a
localization method that can avoid the occurrence of flip ambiguities in
bounded distance measurement errors and constrained flying motions; to
demonstrate its efficacy, the method is implemented on bilateration and
trilateration. For bilateration, an improved bi-boundary model based on the
unit disk graph model is created to compensate for the shortage of distance
constraints, and two boundaries are estimated as the communication range
constraint. The characteristic of the intersections of the communication range
and distance constraints is studied to present a unique localization criterion
which can avoid the occurrence of flip ambiguities. Similarly, for
trilateration, another unique localization criterion for avoiding flip
ambiguities is proposed according to the characteristic of the intersections of
three distance constraints. The theoretical proof shows that these proposed
criteria are correct. A localization algorithm is constructed based on these
two criteria. The algorithm is validated using simulations for different
scenarios and parameters, and the proposed method is shown to provide excellent
localization performance in terms of average estimated error. Our code can be

selected solar data to understand solar magnetic fields. Torsional oscillations
are speed-up and slow-down bands of the azimuthal flow that correlate with the
solar cycle, and they imply the existence of a symmetric solar dynamo with a
measured polar flux of 3x10^14 Wb. It is shown that the solar dynamo is thin
(~0.1 Mm gradient scale size) and powerful (~10^23 W). These properties are
found from the amplitude of the torsional oscillations and the relationship of
their velocity contours to solar magnetograms supports the result. The dynamo
has enough power to heat the chromosphere and to power the corona and the solar
wind. The dynamo also causes a rigid rotation of the heliosphere out to at
least the corona and the relationship of the rotation of the corona to solar
magnetograms supports this result as well. The thin solar dynamo sustains a
thin stable minimum energy state that seems to be covering most of the solar
surface just below the photosphere. The magnetic field lines of the minimum
energy state should be parallel to the solar surface and rotate with distance
from the surface with 2{\pi} radians of rotation in ~1 Mm Resistive diffusion
helps to push the magnetic fields to the surface and the global magnetic
structure (GMS) seems to lose {\pi} radians every 11 years, causing the
observed 180 degree flipping of the solar magnetic field. The thin sheets of
magnetized plasma in solar prominences may be the lost thin sheets of the GMS.
For completeness, the formation of sunspots, CMEs and flares is discussed.

that the control center is misled into detecting as an obvious line outage at a
different position in the local area of the power system. Therefore, the

  survival signature","21 pages",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is often difficult for a phased mission system (PMS) to be highly
reliable, because this entails achieving high reliability in every phase of
operation. Consequently, reliability analysis of such systems is of critical
importance. However, efficient and interpretable analysis of PMSs enabling
general component lifetime distributions, arbitrary structures, and the
possibility that components skip phases has been an open problem.
  In this paper, we show that the survival signature can be used for
reliability analysis of PMSs with similar types of component in each phase,
providing an alternative to the existing limited approaches in the literature.
We then develop new methodology addressing the full range of challenges above.
The new method retains the attractive survival signature property of separating
the system structure from the component lifetime distributions, simplifying
computation, insight into, and inference for system reliability.

assimilation. Model errors associated with sub-grid scale processes are often
represented through stochastic parameterizations of the unresolved process.
Many existing Stochastic Parameterization schemes are only applicable when
knowledge of the true sub-grid scale process or full observations of the coarse
scale process are available, which is typically not the case in real
applications. We present a methodology for estimating the statistics of
sub-grid scale processes for the more realistic case that only partial
observations of the coarse scale process are available. Model error
realizations are estimated over a training period by minimizing their
conditional sum of squared deviations given some informative covariates (e.g.
state of the system), constrained by available observations and assuming that
the observation errors are smaller than the model errors. From these
realizations a conditional probability distribution of additive model errors
given these covariates is obtained, allowing for complex non-Gaussian error
structures. Random draws from this density are then used in actual ensemble
data assimilation experiments. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach
through numerical experiments with the multi-scale Lorenz 96 system using both
small and large time scale separations between slow (coarse scale) and fast
(fine scale) variables. The resulting error estimates and forecasts obtained
with this new method are superior to those from two existing methods.

method is based on classical ideas from computational geometry. First, we
approximate the support of a scatterer by a point cloud. Secondly, we use the
Bayesian paradigm to model the joint conditional probability distribution of
the non-convex hull of the point cloud and the constant refractive index of the
scatterer given near field data. Of note, we use the non-convex hull of the

Finally, in order to sample the arising posterior distribution, we propose a
probability transition kernel that commutes with affine transformations of

our sampling method is robust to estimate a quantity of interest such as the
area of the scatterer. We conclude pointing out a series of generalizations of

great interest in developing a computer-aided system for pulmonary nodules
detection as early as possible on thoracic CT scans. In general, a nodule

reduction from candidates. However, due to the high variation of nodule
morphological characteristics and the possibility of mistaking them for

information inherent in different input scales with gradual integration, and
(3) to learn multi-stream feature integration in an end-to-end manner. To

classical physics and are formulated based on independent principles. We
propose that the formalism of classical dynamics can be considered as the
theoretical foundation of the current theory of relativity and may be employed
for exploring possibilities beyond the current theory. We show that
special-relativistic kinematics, including universality of the speed of
massless particles relative to inertial frames, is a consequence of the
formalism of classical dynamics, with no assumptions other than spacetime point
transformations and Euclidean geometry of space in inertial frames. We discuss
that energy-independent velocity is a general concept in classical dynamics,
applicable even to massive objects, in appropriate canonical coordinates. The
derivation of Lorentz symmetry is inherently local and allows the speed of
massless particles (relative to local inertial frames) to vary with space and
time globally, which may provide a theoretical foundation for variable speed of
light cosmology. We obtain no kinematical scales other than the light-speed,
specially no scale of energy or momentum as has been suggested in some quantum
gravity investigations. We argue that this is a consequence of spacetime point
transformations making the momentum space linear, and a possible second scale
must require non-point transformations as a necessary condition, which seems
compatible with the notion of relative locality in curved momentum space.

spatial-spectral cube matching frame (SSCMF) was proposed to explore the
non-local spatial-spectrum similarities for spectral CT. The method constructs
such a group by clustering up a series of non-local spatial-spectrum cubes. The
small size of spatial patch for such a group make SSCMF fails to encode the

collaboration filtering operation in the SSCMF are also rough to recover the

To avoid the above limitation and further improve image quality, we first
formulate a non-local cube-based tensor instead of the group to encode the
sparsity and low-rank properties. Then, as a new regularizer,
Kronecker-Basis-Representation (KBR) tensor factorization is employed into a
basic spectral CT reconstruction model to enhance the ability of extracting

by sky watchers and auroral enthusiasts in obtaining high-quality digital
images of rare and unusual auroral structures. A feature of particular
interest, which has been nicknamed ""Steve"", typically takes the form of a
short-lived arch, beam, or narrow band of light in the sky. MacDonald et al.
have established that the phenomenon is characterised by a range of optically
visible low magnetic latitude structures associated with a strong subauroral
ion drift. Respecting its nickname, they have dubbed the phenomenon STEVE, an
acronym for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. Here, we draw
attention to earlier observations of similar structures, showing that some
previously unidentified atmospheric, meteoric or auroral ""anomalies"" can now be
recognized as examples of ""Steve"", and therefore as part of a broad spectrum of
occasional auroral features that may appear well below the region of magnetic
latitudes represented by the traditional auroral oval. This highlights the
contributions of ""citizen scientists"" dating back hundreds of years, and the
importance of reassessing historical reports of rare auroral luminosities for a
full understanding of the range of solar activity over millennia.

elements on small random tree networks. Stochastic external inputs are applied
to the leaves causing large spiking events. Those events propagate along the
tree branches and, eventually, exciting the root node. Using Hodgkin-Huxley
type nodal elements, such a setup serves as a model for sensory neurons with
branched myelinated distal terminals. We focus on the influence of the
variability of tree structures on the spike train statistics of the root node.
We present a statistical description of random tree network and show how the
structural variability translates into the collective network dynamics. In
particular, we show that in the physiologically relevant case of strong
coupling the variability of collective response is determined by the joint
probability distribution of the total number of leaves and nodes. We further
present analytical results for the strong coupling limit in which the entire
tree network can be represented by an effective single element.

  arXiv:1801.03470",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Debye-H\""uckel equation is a fundamental physical model in chemical
thermodynamics that describes the free energy (chemical potential, activity) of
an ion in electrolyte solutions at variable salt concentration, temperature,
and pressure. It is based on the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation that ignores
the steric (finite size), correlation, and polarization effects of ions and
water (or solvent molecules). The Poisson-Fermi theory developed in recent
years takes these effects into account. A generalized Debye-H\""uckel equation
is derived from the Poisson-Fermi theory and is shown to consistently reduce to
the classical equation when these effects vanish in limiting cases. As a
result, a linear fourth-order Poisson-Fermi equation is presented for which
unique solutions are shown to exist for spherically symmetric systems.
Moreover, a generalized Debye length is proposed to include the size effects of
ions and water.

following the Planck mission reports presented in 2015 regarding cosmic
microwave background (CMB), there is an increasing interest in searching for
inflaton candidates within fundamental theories and to ultimately test them
with future CMB data. This thesis presents inflationary models using a
methodology that can be described as venturing top-down or bottom-up along
energy scales. In the top-down motivation, we study inflationary scenarios in
string theory and supergravity (SUGRA), namely with (multiple) 3-forms,
Dirac-Born-Infeld Galileon model, a string field theory setup and
$\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA $\alpha-$attractor models. In the bottom-up motivation,
we construct a grand unified theory based inflationary model with an additional
conformal symmetry and study not only inflation but also provide predictions
related to particle physics. Our research work includes various classes of
inflation driven by scalar fields under a canonical, non-canonical and induced
gravity frameworks. All these models are consistent with Planck data, supported
by key primordial cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index
$n_{s}$, the tensor to scalar ratio $r$, together with the primordial
non-Gaussianities. Future probes aiming to detect primordial gravitational
waves and CMB non-Gaussianities can further help to distinguish between them.
