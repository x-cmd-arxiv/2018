consequence of their topological properties. In the non-interacting case, the
derivative of the orbital magnetization with respect to chemical potential is
proportional to this anomalous Hall effect, the Str$\check{\text{e}}$da
formula. Motivated by compounds such as $\text{Mn}_3\text{Sn}$, here we
investigate how interactions modeled by a Hubbard $U$ impact on both quantities
when the Fermi energy is either aligned with the Weyl nodes or away from them.
Within Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we find, in the Weyl semimetal regime, away
from interaction-induced Mott or band-insulating phases, that interactions lead
not only to spectral weight redistribution between coherent bands and Hubbard
bands, but also to an increase in the imbalance between the densities of spin
species. This increased imbalance leads to a larger anomalous Hall effect in
ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals. But this interaction-induced spin imbalance also
compensates the reduction in orbital magnetization of each spin species that
comes from smaller quasiparticle weight. The combined effects lead to an
orbital magnetization that depends weakly on interaction strength and changes
linearly upon doping at small doping. The Str$\check{\text{e}}$da formula is
no-longer satisfied. Away from the insulating phases, the quasiparticle picture
and low-order perturbation theory go a long way to explain these results.

the fixed point and thus full scaling in space and time is generically reached
at very long evolution times, we propose that systems can show prescaling much
earlier in time, in particular, on experimentally accessible time scales.
During the prescaling evolution, some well-measurable properties of spatial
correlations already scale with the universal exponents of the fixed point

evolution obeying conservation laws associated with the remaining symmetry
which also defines the universality class of the asymptotically reached

to ergodic random planar environments. We extend some of these results to
random environments in which the length scale varies from place to place, so
that the law of the environment is in a certain sense only translation
invariant {\em modulo scaling}. For our purposes, an ``environment'' consists
of an infinite random planar map embedded in $\mathbb C$, each of whose edges
comes with a positive real conductance. Our main result is that under modest
constraints (translation invariance modulo scaling together with the finiteness
of a type of specific energy) a random walk in this kind of environment
converges to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization in the quenched
sense.
  Environments of the type considered here arise naturally in the study of
random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity. In fact, the results of this
paper are used in separate works to prove that certain random planar maps
(embedded in the plane via the so-called Tutte embedding) have scaling limits
given by SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity, and also to provide a more
explicit construction of Brownian motion on the Brownian map. However, the
results of this paper are much more general and can be read independently of
that program.
  One general consequence of our main result is that if a translation invariant
(modulo scaling) random embedded planar map and its dual have finite energy per
area, then they are close on large scales to a minimal energy embedding (the
harmonic embedding). To establish Brownian motion convergence for an {\em
infinite} energy embedding, it suffices to show that one can perturb it to make
the energy finite.

systems on $\mathbb Z^d$ with continuous time Markov dynamics of Glauber type,

family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation.
Furthermore, KCM have an interest in their own since they display some of the
most striking features of the liquid-glass transition, a major and longstanding
open problem in condensed matter physics. A key issue for KCM is to identify
the scaling of the characteristic time scales when the equilibrium density of
empty sites, $q$, goes to zero. In [19,20] a general scheme was devised to
determine a sharp upper bound for these time scales. Our paper is devoted to
developing a (very different) technique which allows to prove matching lower
bounds. We analyse the class of two-dimensional supercritical rooted KCM and
the Duarte KCM, the most studied critical $1$-rooted model. We prove that the
relaxation time and the mean infection time diverge for supercritical rooted
KCM as $e^{\Theta((\log q)^2)}$ and for Duarte KCM as $e^{\Theta((\log
q)^4/q^2)}$ when $q\downarrow 0$. These results prove the conjectures put
forward in [20,22], and establish that the time scales for these KCM diverge
much faster than for the corresponding $\mathcal U$-bootstrap processes, the
main reason being the occurrence of energy barriers which determine the
dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the bootstrap dynamics.

polarizable quantum particle by a perfectly conducting toroid, which is one of
the most common objects exhibiting a non-trivial topology. We employ a
convenient method developed by Eberlein and Zietal that essentially relates the
quantum problem of calculating dispersion forces between a quantum particle and
a perfectly conducting surface of arbitrary shape to a corresponding classical
problem of electrostatics. Considering the quantum particle in the symmetry
axis of the toroid, we use this method to find an exact analytical result for
the van der Waals interaction between the quantum particle and the conducting
toroid. Surprisingly, we show that for appropriate values of the two radii of
the toroid the dispersive force on the quantum particle is repulsive. This is a
remarkable result since repulsion in dispersive interactions involving only
electric objects (and particles) in vacuum is rarely reported in the
literature. Final comments are made about particular limiting cases as, for
instance, the quantum particle-nanoring system.

solved in a Las Vegas fashion (i.e., without false negatives) for $\ell_p$
($1\le p\le 2$) while matching the performance of optimal locality-sensitive
hashing. Specifically, we construct a data-independent Las Vegas data structure
with query time $O(dn^{\rho})$ and space usage $O(dn^{1+\rho})$ for $(r, c
r)$-approximate near neighbors in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ under the $\ell_p$ norm,
where $\rho = 1/c^p + o(1)$. Furthermore, we give a Las Vegas
locality-sensitive filter construction for the unit sphere that can be used
with the data-dependent data structure of Andoni et al. (SODA 2017) to achieve
optimal space-time tradeoffs in the data-dependent setting. For the symmetric
case, this gives us a data-dependent Las Vegas data structure with query time
$O(dn^{\rho})$ and space usage $O(dn^{1+\rho})$ for $(r, c r)$-approximate near
neighbors in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ under the $\ell_p$ norm, where $\rho = 1/(2c^p -
1) + o(1)$.
  Our data-independent construction improves on the recent Las Vegas data
structure of Ahle (FOCS 2017) for $\ell_p$ when $1 < p\le 2$. Our
data-dependent construction does even better for $\ell_p$ for all $p\in [1, 2]$
and is the first Las Vegas approximate near neighbors data structure to make
use of data-dependent approaches. We also answer open questions of Indyk (SODA
2000), Pagh (SODA 2016), and Ahle by showing that for approximate near
neighbors, Las Vegas data structures can match state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
data structures in performance for both the data-independent and data-dependent
settings and across space-time tradeoffs.

mystery, since no external appendages are involved in their motion which is
known as gliding. However, the physical principles behind gliding motility
still remain poorly understood. Using myxobacteria as a canonical example of
such organisms, we identify here the physical principles behind gliding
motility, and develop a theoretical model that predicts a two-regime behavior
of the gliding speed as a function of the substrate stiffness. Our theory
describes the elastic, viscous, and capillary interactions between the
bacterial membrane carrying a traveling wave, the secreted slime acting as a
lubricating film, and the substrate which we model as a soft solid. Defining
the myxobacterial gliding as the horizontal motion on the substrate under zero
net force, we find the two-regime behavior is due to two different mechanisms
of motility thrust. On stiff substrates, the thrust arises from the bacterial
shape deformations creating a flow of slime that exerts a pressure along the
bacterial length. This pressure in conjunction with the bacterial shape
provides the necessary thrust for propulsion. However, we show that such a
mechanism cannot lead to gliding on very soft substrates. Instead, we show that
capillary effects lead to the formation of a ridge at the slime-substrate-air
interface, which creates a thrust in the form of a localized pressure gradient
at the tip of the bacteria. To test our theory, we perform experiments with
isolated cells on agar substrates of varying stiffness and find the measured
gliding speeds to be in good agreement with the predictions from our
elasto-capillary-hydrodynamic model. The physical mechanisms reported here
serve as an important step towards an accurate theory of friction and
substrate-mediated interaction between bacteria in a swarm of cells
proliferating in soft media.

iteration whose size grows linearly in the number of iterations. We propose a
limited memory version of Kelley's method (L-KM) and os OSM that requires
limited memory (at most n + 1 constraints for an n-dimensional problem)

L-FCFW, of the Fully-Corrective Frank-Wolfe (FCFW) method with approximate

of extensions (e.g. to lower dimensions or to an arbitrary product of unitary
gauge groups) are conceptually straightforward. Amongst other features, the
program is able to: (i) check whether an input list of Lagrangian operators (of
a given dimension in the EFT expansion) is a basis for the space of operators
contributing to S-matrix elements, once redundancies (such as Fierz-Pauli
identities, integration by parts, and equations of motion) are taken into
account; (ii) generate such a basis (where possible) from an input algorithm;
(iii) carry out a change of basis. We describe applications to the SM (where we
carry out a number of non-trivial cross-checks) and extensions thereof, and
outline how the program may be of use in precision tests of the SM and in the
ongoing search for new physics at the LHC and elsewhere. The code and

These partial recovery bounds for the relaxed $K$means improve upon results
currently known in the sGMM setting. In the SBM setting, applying the relaxed

SDPs investigated in the literature are restricted to the assortative case

distance d_A(z) uniquely reaches a maximum (at z_max) and then shrinks to zero
towards the big bang. The location of this turning point depends sensitively on
the model, but has been difficult to measure. In this paper, we estimate and
use z_max inferred from quasar cores: (1) by employing a sample of 140 objects
yielding a much reduced dispersion due to pre-constrained limits on their
spectral index and luminosity, (2) by reconstructing d_A(z) using Gaussian
processes, and (3) comparing the predictions of seven different cosmologies and
showing that the measured value of z_max can effectively discriminate between
them. We find that z_max=1.70 +\- 0.20---an important new probe of the
Universe's geometry. The most strongly favoured model is R_h=ct, followed by
Planck LCDM. Several others, including Milne, Einstein-de Sitter and Static
tired light are strongly rejected. According to these results, the R_h=ct
universe, which predicts z_max=1.718, has a ~92.8% probability of being the
correct cosmology. For consistency, we also carry out model selection based on
d_A(z) itself. This test confirms that R_h=ct and Planck LCDM are among the few
models that account for angular-size data better than those that are
disfavoured by z_max. The d_A(z) comparison, however, is less discerning than
that with z_max, due to the additional free parameter, H_0. We find that
H_0=63.4 +\- 1.2 km/s/Mpc for R_h=ct, and 69.9 +\- 1.5 km/s/Mpc for LCDM. Both
are consistent with previously measured values in each model, though they
differ from each other by over 4 sigma. In contrast, model selection based on
z_max is independent of H_0.

theories characterized by the introduction of a time-like unit vector field,

consequence of a broken Lorentz invariance. In the present work we have
obtained and analyzed some exact solutions allowed by this theory for two
particular cases of perfect fluid, both with
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) symmetry: (i) a fluid with constant
energy density ($p=-\rho_0$), and (ii) a fluid with zero energy density
($\rho_0=0$), corresponding to the vacuum solution with and without
cosmological constant ($\Lambda$), respectively. Our solutions show that the EA
and GR theories do not differentiate each other only by the coupling constants.
This difference is clearly shown because of the existence of singularities that
there are not in GR theory. This characteristic appears in the solutions with
$p=-\rho_0$ as well as with $\rho_0=0$, where this last one depends only on the
aether field. Besides, we consider the term of the EA theory in the
Raychaudhuri equation and discuss the meaning of the strong energy condition in
this scenario and found that this depends on aether field. The solutions admit
an expanding or contracting system. A bounce, a singular, a constant and an
accelerated expansion solutions were also obtained, exhibiting the richness of
the EA theory from the dynamic point of view of a collapsing system or of a
cosmological model. The analysis of energy conditions, considering an effective
fluid shows that the term of the aether contributes significantly for the
accelerated expansion of the system for the case in which the energy density is
constant. On the other hand, for the vacuum case ($\rho_0=0$), the energy
conditions are all satisfied for the aether fluid.

studied intensively since the 1970s; in particular it is known to be stable if
the underlying manifold is connected and open. Closely related to configuration
spaces are moduli spaces of manifolds with marked points, and in [Tillmann,
2016] this relation was used to show that the homology of these moduli spaces
is also stable as the number of marked points goes to infinity.
  Since a disc neighbourhood of a marked point may be viewed as the cone on its
boundary sphere, we may think of marked points as inessential conical
singularities in the underlying manifold. In this paper, we prove stability for
the homology of moduli spaces of manifolds with conical singularities, allowing
more general -- essential -- singularities.
  This is deduced as a special case of a more general homological stability
result for classifying spaces of symmetric diffeomorphism groups of manifolds,
with respect to parametric connected sum, an operation generalising ordinary
connected sum and surgery (including Dehn surgery).
  The key input for the proof is stability for the homology of moduli spaces of
disconnected submanifolds [Palmer, 2018], which generalises configurations of
point-particles to configurations of higher-dimensional submanifolds. Along the
way, we extend this result further to homology with polynomially twisted
coefficients and configurations of labelled submanifolds.

collection of random variables. In the Gaussian case, each such model
corresponds to a semi-algebraic set of positive definite covariance matrices.
The set is given via parametrization, and much work has gone into obtaining an
implicit description in terms of polynomial (in-)equalities. Implicit
descriptions shed light on problems such as parameter identification, model
equivalence, and constraint-based statistical inference. For models given by
directed acyclic graphs, which represent settings where all relevant variables
are observed, there is a complete theory: All conditional independence
relations can be found via graphical $d$-separation and are sufficient for an
implicit description. The situation is far more complicated, however, when some
of the variables are hidden (or in other words, unobserved or latent). We
consider models associated to mixed graphs that capture the effects of hidden
variables through correlated error terms. The notion of trek separation
explains when the covariance matrix in such a model has submatrices of low rank
and generalizes $d$-separation. However, in many cases, such as the infamous
Verma graph, the polynomials defining the graphical model are not
determinantal, and hence cannot be explained by $d$-separation or
trek-separation. In this paper, we show that these constraints often correspond
to the vanishing of nested determinants and can be graphically explained by a
notion of restricted trek separation.

forcing the particle flux vanishes as $k_{\textrm{D}}^{-2}$ in the
dissipationless limit $k_{\textrm{D}}\rightarrow \infty$, while the energy flux
is independent of $k_{\textrm{D}}$. Moreover, our time-resolved measurements
give unique access to the pre-steady-state dynamics, when the cascade front

been predicted in the present work, by using the value of the parameter,
$\beta$ for $\Upsilon(1D)$, interpolated from the $\beta$ versus mass relation,
for the upsilon states. The effects of the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear
medium on the masses of the upsilon states are investigated and are observed to
be large for high densities. This should have observable consequences at the
asymmetric heavy ion collisions at the Compressed baryonic matter (CBM)
experiments at FAIR, GSI as well as at SPS, CERN. The study of the bottomonium
states at CBM will however require access to higher energies than the energy
regime planned at present. The effects of magnetic field on the masses of
bottomonium states in nuclear matter are studied in the present work. These
masses are investigated including the anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) of the
nucleons, and compared to the results when the AMMs of nucleons are not taken
into account. The effects of magnetic field as well as isospin asymmetry on the

emerge. Deconfined phases with algebraic spin and VBS correlation functions are
also observed. Such deconfined phases are an incarnation of exotic states of

deconfined and confined phases, as well as that between the different confined

$t_{\text{Th}}$ marks the point beyond which the dynamics acquire universal

of large scale aspherical motion in the Si and O shells surrounding the
collapsing iron core aid shock expansion and bring the models closer to the
threshold of explosion. We also find some dependence on resolution and geometry
(octant vs. full 4$\pi$). As has been noted in other recent works, we find that
the post-shock turbulence plays an important role in determining the overall
dynamical evolution of our simulations. We find a strong standing accretion
shock instability (SASI) that develops at late times during the shock recession
epoch. The SASI aids in transient shock expansion phases, but is not enough to
result in shock revival. We also report that for a subset of our simulations,
we find conclusive evidence for the LESA first reported in Tamborra et al.

obtain these results, we derive the stellar masses of our sample by fitting
synthetic stellar population models to their observed spectral energy
distribution with the inclusion of nebular emission lines. This is the deepest
and farthest in distance mass function measured to date and probes down to a
level of M$_{*} = 10^{6.8}M_{\odot}$. The main result of this study is that the
low-mass end of our GSMF to these limits and redshifts appears to become
steeper from $-1.98_{-0.07}^{+0.07}$ at $z=6$ to $-2.38_{-0.88}^{+0.72}$ at
$z=9$, steeper than previously observed mass functions at slightly lower
redshifts, and we find no evidence of turnover in the mass range probed. We
furthermore demonstrate that the UV LF for these system also appears to show a
steepening at the highest redshifts, without any evidence of turnover in the
luminosity range probed. Our $M_{\mathrm{UV}}-M_{*}$ relation exhibit shallower
slopes than previously observed and are in accordance with a constant
mass-to-light ratio. Integrating our GSMF, we find that the stellar mass
density increases by a factor of $\sim15_{-6}^{+21}$ from $z=9$ to $z=6$. We
estimate the dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) to calculate the
specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}=\mathrm{SFR/M_{*}}$) of our
sample, and find that for a fixed stellar mass of $5\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$,
sSFR $\propto(1+z)^{2.01\pm0.16}$. Finally, from our new measurements, we
estimate the UV luminosity density ($\rho_{\textrm{UV}}$) and find that our

with simulations based on two novel theoretical approaches well-suited to treat
this many-photon limit. At low incoming flux, we report good agreement between
both theories and the experiment. For higher input flux, the intensity of the
outgoing light is lower than that obtained from theoretical predictions. We
explain this discrepancy using a simple phenomenological model taking into
account pollutants, which are nearly-stationary Rydberg excitations coming from
the reabsorption of scattered probe photons. At high incoming photon rates, the
blockade physics results in unconventional shapes of measured correlation
functions.

""apparent horizon"") is an imaginary surface beyond which all null geodesics
recede from the observer. The Universe has an apparent (gravitational) horizon,
but unlike its counterpart in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, it is not
static. It may eventually turn into an event horizon---an asymptotically
defined membrane that forever separates causally connected events from those
that are not---depending on the equation of state of the cosmic fluid. In this
paper, we examine how and why an apparent (gravitational) horizon is manifested
in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, and why it is becoming so pivotal to
our correct interpretation of the cosmological data. We discuss its
observational signature and demonstrate how it alone defines the proper size of
our visible Universe. In so doing, we affirm its physical reality and its

bi-directional communication, and a hand-held external transceiver. The mote
consists of a piezoceramic transducer, an energy storage capacitor, and a
stimulator integrated circuit (IC). The IC harvests ultrasonic power with high
efficiency, decodes stimulation parameter downlink data, and generates
current-controlled stimulation pulses. Stimulation parameters are time-encoded
on the fly through the wireless link rather than being programmed and stored on
the mote, reducing power consumption and on-chip memory requirements and
enabling complex stimulation protocols with high-temporal resolution and
low-latency feedback for use in closed-loop stimulation. Uplink data indicates
whether the mote is currently stimulating; it is encoded by the mote via
backscatter modulation and is demodulated at the external transceiver. We show
that the mote operates at an acoustic intensity that is 7.8% of the FDA limit

robustness to expected real-world misalignment. We demonstrate the in vivo

drawn from among BALs with smaller balnicity indices, shallower depths, larger
velocities, and smaller widths. Within two rest-frame years (average) after a
BAL has emerged, we find it equally likely to continue increasing in equivalent
width in an observation six months later (average) as it is to start
decreasing. From the time separations between our observations, we conclude the
coherence time-scale of BALs is less than 100 rest-frame days. We observe
coordinated variability among pairs of troughs in the same quasar, likely due
to clouds at different velocities responding to the same changes in ionizing
flux; and the coordination is stronger if the velocity separation between the
two troughs is smaller. We speculate the latter effect may be due to clouds
having on average lower densities at higher velocities due to mass conservation
in an accelerating flow, causing the absorbing gas in those clouds to respond
on different timescales to the same ionizing flux variations.

the critical energy scales of the involved Bosonic mode, which are $\sim$15 and

energy scales of our Raman scattering data, we identify these Bosonic modes as
Raman active breathing (${\text{A}}_\text{1g}$) and shear

presents observations of two flares that both apparently violate the previously

Sun's magnetic field, identifying that it takes about 22 years for the Sun's
magnetic polarity to cycle. It was also identified that the latitudinal
distribution of sunspots resembles the wings of a butterfly showing migration
of sunspots in each hemisphere that abruptly start at mid-latitudes towards the
Sun's equator over the next 11 years. These sunspot patterns were shown to be
asymmetric across the equator. In intervening years, it was deduced that the
Sun (and sun-like stars) possess magnetic activity cycles that are assumed to
be the physical manifestation of a dynamo process that results from complex
circulatory transport processes in the star's interior. Understanding the Sun's
magnetism, its origin and its variation, has become a fundamental scientific
objective \-- the distribution of magnetism, and its interaction with
convective processes, drives various plasma processes in the outer atmosphere.
In the past few decades, a range of diagnostic techniques have been employed to
systematically study finer scale magnetized objects, and associated phenomena.
The patterns discerned became known as the ``Extended Solar Cycle'' (ESC). The
patterns of the ESC appeared to extend the wings of the activity butterfly back

much higher solar latitudes. In this short review, we describe their
observational patterns of the ESC and discuss possible connections to the solar

of the cluster is clearly bimodal in near-UV -- optical colour-magnitude
diagrams, thus suggesting that IC4499 is actually composed by two
sub-populations of stars with different nitrogen abundances. This represents
the first detection of multiple populations in IC4499. Consistently, we also
find that one star out of six is Na-rich to some extent, while we do not detect
any evidence of intrinsic spread in both Mg and O. The number ratio between
stars with normal and enriched nitrogen is in good agreement with the number
ratio - mass trend observed in Galactic globular clusters. Also, as typically
found in other systems, nitrogen rich stars are more centrally concentrated
than normal stars, although this result cannot be considered conclusive because
of the limited field of view covered by our observations (~$1r_h$). On the
contrary, we observe that both the RGB UV color spread, which is a proxy of N
variations, and Na abundance variations, are significantly smaller than those
observed in Milky Way globular clusters with mass and metallicity comparable to
IC4499. The modest N and Na spreads observed in this system can be tentatively
connected to the fact that IC4499 likely formed in a disrupted dwarf galaxy
orbiting the Milky Way, as previously proposed based on its orbit.

more efficient if the distances between the data points satisfy a metric. These
algorithms include metric learning, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
Because real data sets are noisy, the similarity measures often fail to satisfy
a metric. For this reason, Gilbert and Jain [11] and Fan, et al. [8] introduce
the closely related problems of $\textit{sparse metric repair}$ and
$\textit{metric violation distance}$. The goal of each problem is to repair as
few distances as possible to ensure that the distances between the data points
satisfy a metric. We generalize these problems so as to no longer require all
the distances between the data points. That is, we consider a weighted graph
$G$ with corrupted weights w and our goal is to find the smallest number of
modifications to the weights so that the resulting weighted graph distances
satisfy a metric. This problem is a natural generalization of the sparse metric
repair problem and is more flexible as it takes into account different
relationships amongst the input data points. As in previous work, we
distinguish amongst the types of repairs permitted (decrease, increase, and
general repairs). We focus on the increase and general versions and establish
hardness results and show the inherent combinatorial structure of the problem.
We then show that if we restrict to the case when $G$ is a chordal graph, then
the problem is fixed parameter tractable. We also present several classes of
approximation algorithms. These include and improve upon previous metric repair
algorithms for the special case when $G = K_n$

0.03 km/s, with a dispersion of 5.8 km/s, in the sense that APOGEE RVs are

occurs in the surface gravities. Using only surface gravities in calibrated red
giants from APOGEE DR14, where there are 24,074 stars in common, a deviation of
0.14 dex is found with substantial scatter. There are 17,482 red giant stars in
common between APOGEE DR14 and those in LAMOST tied to APOGEE DR12 via the

we find dependencies of the differences of the stellar parameters on effective
temperature. For metal-rich stars, a different trend for the [Fe/H]
discrepancies is found. Surprisingly, we see no correlation between the
internal APOGEE DR14 - DR12 differences in Teff and those in DR14 - LAMOST tied
to DR12, where a correlation should be expected since LAMOST has been
calibrated to APOGEE DR12. We also find no correlation between the [Fe/H]

summing simple functions over a large number of objects. Modern applications
pose an additional challenge in that such functions often depend on a parameter
vector $y$ (query) that is unknown a priori. Given a set of points $X\subset
\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a pairwise function $w:\mathbb{R}^{d}\times
\mathbb{R}^{d}\to [0,1]$, we study the problem of designing a data-structure
that enables sublinear-time approximation of the summation
$Z_{w}(y)=\frac{1}{|X|}\sum_{x\in X}w(x,y)$ for any query $y\in
\mathbb{R}^{d}$. By combining ideas from Harmonic Analysis (partitions of unity
and approximation theory) with Hashing-Based-Estimators [Charikar, Siminelakis
FOCS'17], we provide a general framework for designing such data structures
through hashing that reaches far beyond what previous techniques allowed.
  A key design principle is a collection of $T\geq 1$ hashing schemes with
collision probabilities $p_{1},\ldots, p_{T}$ such that $\sup_{t\in
[T]}\{p_{t}(x,y)\} = \Theta(\sqrt{w(x,y)})$. This leads to a data-structure
that approximates $Z_{w}(y)$ using a sub-linear number of samples from each
hash family. Using this new framework along with Distance Sensitive Hashing
[Aumuller, Christiani, Pagh, Silvestri PODS'18], we show that such a collection
can be constructed and evaluated efficiently for any log-convex function
$w(x,y)=e^{\phi(\langle x,y\rangle)}$ of the inner product on the unit sphere
$x,y\in \mathcal{S}^{d-1}$.
  Our method leads to data structures with sub-linear query time that
significantly improve upon random sampling and can be used for Kernel Density

bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) which serves as an important link between
the powerful quasars at higher redshift and local Seyfert galaxies. We find
that although the bolometric luminosities of the LLQSOs are lower than those of
the higher redshift quasars by almost an order of magnitude, their distribution
of the Eddington rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is similar. We detect a strong
anti-correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and $L_{2500 \rm \AA}$, as has also
been detected in several other quasar studies with large sample sizes,
indicating that as the UV luminosity of the source increases, the X-ray
luminosity decreases. We do not detect any significant neutral obscuration
($N_{\rm H} \ge10^{22}\, \rm cm^{-2}$) in the X-ray spectra of the LLQSOs, and
hence rule out obscuration as a possible cause for their lower luminosity. We
conclude that the central engines of the LLQSOs function similarly to those of
the higher redshift quasars, and the difference is possibly because of the fact
that the LLQSOs have lower black hole masses. We do not find any correlation
between the molecular gas in the host galaxies and accretion states of the AGN.
This indicates that the presence of molecular gas in the host galaxies of the
LLQSOs does not significantly influence the instantaneous accretion rates of
their SMBHs.

distributed computing to find maximum-weight matchings in a hypergraph of rank
$r$. Our main result is a deterministic algorithm to generate a matching which
is an $O(r)$-approximation to the maximum weight matching, running in $\tilde
O(r \log \Delta + \log^2 \Delta + \log^* n)$ rounds. (Here, the $\tilde O()$
notations hides $\text{polyloglog } \Delta$ and $\text{polylog } r$ factors).
This is based on a number of new derandomization techniques extending methods
of Ghaffari, Harris & Kuhn (2017).
  As a main application, we obtain nearly-optimal algorithms for the
long-studied problem of maximum-weight graph matching. Specifically, we get a
$(1+\epsilon)$ approximation algorithm using $\tilde O(\log \Delta / \epsilon^3
+ \text{polylog}(1/\epsilon, \log \log n))$ randomized time and $\tilde
O(\log^2 \Delta / \epsilon^4 + \log^*n / \epsilon)$ deterministic time.
  The second application is a faster algorithm for hypergraph maximal matching,
a versatile subroutine introduced in Ghaffari et al. (2017) for a variety of
local graph algorithms. This gives an algorithm for $(2 \Delta - 1)$-edge-list
coloring in $\tilde O(\log^2 \Delta \log n)$ rounds deterministically or
$\tilde O( (\log \log n)^3 )$ rounds randomly. Another consequence (with
additional optimizations) is an algorithm which generates an edge-orientation
with out-degree at most $\lceil (1+\epsilon) \lambda \rceil$ for a graph of
arboricity $\lambda$; for fixed $\epsilon$ this runs in $\tilde O(\log^6 n)$
rounds deterministically or $\tilde O(\log^3 n )$ rounds randomly.

fluid-saturated sediments, spanning dense to dilute regimes, developed from the
basic balance laws for two phase-mixtures. The model can represent various
limiting cases, such as pure fluid and dry grains. It is formulated to capture
a number of key behaviors such as: (i) viscous inertial rheology of submerged
wet grains under steady shearing flows, (ii) the critical state behavior of
grains, which causes granular Reynolds dilation/contraction due to shear, (iii)
the viscous thickening of the fluid response due to the presence of suspended
grains, and (iv) the Darcy-like drag interaction observed in both dense and
dilute mixtures, which gives rise to complex fluid-grain interactions under
dilation and flow. The full constitutive model is combined with the basic
equations of motion for each mixture phase and implemented in the material
point method (MPM) to accurately model the coupled dynamics of the mixed
system. Qualitative results show the breadth of problems which this model can
address. Quantitative results demonstrate the accuracy of this model as
compared with analytical limits and experimental observations of fluid and

Schr\""odinger equation and linear kinetic energy terms typical for a particle's

recently since they provide an alternative route for realizing fractional
quantum Hall physics, topological insulators, and spintronics physics. The
present work focuses on the three-boson system in the presence of 1D spin-orbit
coupling, which is most relevant to ongoing cold atom experiments. In the
absence of spin-orbit coupling terms, the three-boson system exibits the Efimov
effect: the entire energy spectrum is uniquely determined by the $s$-wave
scattering length and a single three-body parameter, i.e., using one of the
energy levels as input, the other energy levels can be obtained via Efimov's
radial scaling law, which is intimately tied to a discrete scaling symmetry. It
is demonstrated that the discrete scaling symmetry persists in the presence of
1D spin-orbit coupling, implying the validity of a generalized radial scaling
law in five-dimensional space. The dependence of the energy levels on the
scattering length, spin-orbit coupling parameters, and center-of-mass momentum
is discussed. It is conjectured that three-body systems with other types of
spin-orbit coupling terms are also governed by generalized radial scaling laws,

resonance signals and led to vastly accelerated NMR/MRI imaging and
spectroscopy. Unlike conventional cw-techniques, DNP methods that exploit the
full electron spectrum are appealing since they allow direct participation of
all electrons in the hyperpolarization process. Such methods typically entail
sweeps of microwave radiation over the broad electron linewidth to excite DNP,
but are often inefficient because the sweeps, constrained by adiabaticity
requirements, are slow. In this paper we develop a technique to overcome the
DNP bottlenecks set by the slow sweeps, employing a swept microwave frequency
comb that increases the effective number of polarization transfer events while
respecting adiabaticity constraints. This allows a multiplicative gain in DNP
enhancement, scaling with the number of comb frequencies and limited only by
the hyperfine-mediated electron linewidth. We demonstrate the technique for the
optical hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in powdered microdiamonds at low
fields, increasing the DNP enhancement from 30 to 100 measured with respect to
the thermal signal at 7T. For low concentrations of broad linewidth electron
radicals, e.g. TEMPO, these multiplicative gains could exceed an order of

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with massless fundamental quarks. We derive the
new discrete 't Hooft anomaly of massless QCD for generic numbers of color
$N_\mathrm{c}$ and flavor $N_\mathrm{f}$, and an exotic chiral-symmetry broken
phase without quark-bilinear condensate is ruled out from possible QCD vacua.
We show that the $U(1)_\mathrm{B}$ baryon number symmetry is anomalously broken
when the $(\mathbb{Z}_{2N_\mathrm{f}})_\mathrm{A}$ discrete axial symmetry and
the flavor symmetry are gauged. In the ordinary chiral symmetry breaking, the
Skyrmion current turns out to reproduce this 't Hooft anomaly of massless QCD.
In the exotic chiral symmetry breaking, however, the anomalous breaking of
$U(1)_\mathrm{B}$ does not take the correct form, and it is inconsistent with
anomaly matching. This no-go theorem is based only on symmetries and anomalies,
and thus has a wider range of applicability to the QCD phase diagram than the
previous one obtained by QCD inequalities. Lastly, as another application, we
check that duality of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD with $N_\mathrm{f}\ge
N_\mathrm{c}+1$ satisfies the new anomaly matching.

mechanics, without probability, and interpret them using the notion of
coexistence: a quantum state can be read, not uniquely, as a coexistence of
other quantum states, which are pairwise orthogonal. In this formalism, I prove
that a conscious observer is necessarily a physical object that can memorize
local events by setting one of its parts in an exactly specified constant
quantum state (hypotheses H1, H2 and H3). Then I define the probability of a
future event as the proportion of initial observers, all identical, who will
actually experience that event. It then becomes possible to establish the usual
results of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, I detail the link between
probabilities and relative frequencies. Additionally, I study the biological
feasibility of this modelling of observer's mind.
  The second part of this paper completes the neuronal description of the mind
functions, based on current neuroscientific knowledge. It provides a model that
is compatible with the assumptions of the first part and consistent with our
daily conscious experience. In particular, it develops a model of
self-consciousness based on an explicit use of the random component of neuron
behaviour; according to the first part, that random is in fact the coexistence
of a multiplicity of possibilities. So, when the mind measures the random part
of certain neurons in the brain, he goes himself within each of these
possibilities. The mind has a decision-making component that is active in this
situation, appearing then as the cause of the choice of this possibility among
all the others. This models the self-consciousness which then ensures the unity
of our conscious experience by equating this experience with ``what the ego is
conscious about''. The conclusion details the points that remain to be
developed.

stochastically dependent on the physical states of moving machineries in an
industrial working space. In this paper, the moving machineries are modeled as
Markov decision processes whereas the characteristics of the correlated fading
channels are modeled as a binary random process whose probability measure is a
function of both the moving machineries' physical states and the channels'
transmission power. Under such state-dependent fading channel models,
sufficient conditions which ensure the stochastic safety of the NCS are first
derived. Using the derived safety conditions, the co-design problem is then
formulated as a constrained joint optimization problem that seeks for optimal
control and transmission power policies which simultaneously minimize both the
communication and control costs in an infinite time horizon. This paper shows
that such optimal co-design policies can be obtained in an efficient manner
from the solution of convex programs. Simulation results from industrial NCS

the memory bandwidth. When lines are compressible, the hardware can store
multiple lines in a single memory location, and retrieve all these lines in a
single access, thereby increasing the effective memory bandwidth. However,
relocating and packing multiple lines together depending on the compressibility
causes a line to have multiple possible locations. Therefore, memory
compression designs typically require metadata to specify the compressibility
of the line. Unfortunately, even in the presence of dedicated metadata caches,
maintaining and accessing this metadata incurs significant bandwidth overheads
and can degrade performance by as much as 40%. Ideally, we want to implement
memory compression while eliminating the bandwidth overheads of metadata
accesses.
  This paper proposes CRAM, a bandwidth-efficient design for memory compression
that is entirely hardware based and does not require any OS support or changes
to the memory modules or interfaces. CRAM uses a novel implicit-metadata
mechanism, whereby the compressibility of the line can be determined by

factors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES

intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based
sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to
examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated
from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We
quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network
segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for
a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation
captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,
high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and
this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and
ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in
clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,
consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in
low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of
regional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may
fundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the
human brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of
information processing in late childhood and adolescence.

person image have attracted increasing research attention, yet is still
challenging. A desirable pipeline should not only transform the target clothes
into the most fitting shape seamlessly but also preserve well the clothes
identity in the generated image, that is, the key characteristics (e.g.
texture, logo, embroidery) that depict the original clothes. However, previous
image-conditioned generation works fail to meet these critical requirements
towards the plausible virtual try-on performance since they fail to handle
large spatial misalignment between the input image and target clothes. Prior
work explicitly tackled spatial deformation using shape context matching, but
failed to preserve clothing details due to its coarse-to-fine strategy. In this
work, we propose a new fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On
Network(CP-VTON) for addressing all real-world challenges in this task. First,
CP-VTON learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the in-shop
clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric
Matching Module (GMM) rather than computing correspondences of interest points
as prior works did. Second, to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes
and make the results more realistic, we employ a Try-On Module that learns a
composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to
ensure smoothness. Extensive experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate our
CP-VTON achieves the state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

work on penalized quantile regression has been mostly focused on point

prove that a wild residual bootstrap procedure for unpenalized quantile

a modified version can be used to approximate the distribution of

decades ago and has since generated a sizeable literature. Here we provide the
answer for the case in which energy is injected into the plasma via Alfv\'enic

the ion and electron temperatures. Numerical simulations using a hybrid
fluid-gyrokinetic model indicate that the ion-electron heating-rate ratio is an
increasing function of the thermal-to-magnetic energy ratio,
$\beta_\mathrm{i}$: it ranges from $\sim0.05$ at $\beta_\mathrm{i}=0.1$ to at
least $30$ for $\beta_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$. This energy partition is
approximately insensitive to the ion-to-electron temperature ratio

mechanisms, a collisionless plasma system heated via Alfv\'enic turbulence will
tend towards a nonequilibrium state in which one of the species is

bi-directional cooperative NOMA can be explained in two directions: 1) The
proposed NOMA system is still efficient when the channel gains of scheduled
users are almost the same. 2) The proposed NOMA system operates well without
accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). In a
two-user scenario, the closed-form ergodic capacity of bi-directional
cooperative NOMA is derived and it is proven to be better than those of other
techniques. Based on the ergodic capacity, the algorithms to find optimal power
allocations maximizing user fairness and sum-rate are presented. Outage
probability is also derived, and we show that bi-directional cooperative NOMA
achieves a power gain over uni-directional cooperative NOMA and a diversity
gain over non-cooperative NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We finally
extend the bi-directional cooperative NOMA to a multi-user model. The analysis
of ergodic capacity and outage probability in two-user scenario is numerically
verified. Also, simulation results show that bi-directional cooperative NOMA
provdes better data rates than the existing NOMA schemes as well as OMA in

SIC process can be applicable only when information about the co-scheduled

know whether the received signal is OMA or NOMA, whether SIC is required or
not, and which modulation orders and power ratios have been used for the
superposed UTs, before decoding the signal. An efficient network, e.g.,
vehicular network, requires that the UTs blindly classify the received signal
and apply a matching receiver strategy to reduce the high-layer signaling
overhead which is essential for high-mobility vehicular networks. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance impact of errors in NOMA signal
classification and address ensuing receiver challenges in practical MU usage
cases. In order to reduce the blind signal classification error rate, we
propose transmission schemes that rotate data symbols or pilots to a specific

rotation, a new signal classification algorithm is also proposed. The

occurrence. Photospheric flow fields were determined by applying the
Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) method
to a large data set of 2,548 co-aligned pairs of AR vector magnetograms with
12-min separation over the period 2012-2016. From each AR flow-field map, three
shear-flow parameters were derived corresponding to the mean (<S>), maximum
(S_max) and integral (S_sum) shear-flow speeds along strong-gradient,
strong-field MPIL segments. We calculated flaring rates within 24 hr as a
function of each shear-flow parameter, and also investigated the relation
between the parameters and the waiting time ({\tau}) until the next major flare
(class M1.0 or above) after the parameter observation. In general, it is found
that the larger S_sum an AR has, the more likely it is for the AR to produce
flares within 24 hr. It is also found that among ARs which produce major
flares, if one has a larger value of S_sum then {\tau} generally gets shorter.
These results suggest that large ARs with widespread and/or strong shear flows
along MPILs tend to not only be more flare productive, but also produce major
flares within 24 hr or less.

main bottleneck in such procedures is computation of a quotient for long
division. We give examples to show that with standard arithmetic, if quotients
are computed naively (by using exact norms as denominators, then rounding), the
algorithms have $\Theta(n^3)$ bit complexity. It is a ""folk theorem"" that this
can be reduced to $O(n^2)$ by modifying the division procedure. We give a
self-contained proof of this, and show that quadratic time is best possible for
these algorithms (with standard arithmetic or not).
  We also address the relative efficiency of using reciprocity, as compared to
Euler's criterion, for testing if a given number is a cubic or quartic residue
modulo an odd prime. Which is preferable depends on the number of residue tests
to be done.
  Finally, we discuss the cubic and quartic analogs of Eisenstein's
even-quotient algorithm for computing Jacobi symbols in ${\bf Z}$. Although the
quartic algorithm was given by Smith in 1859, the version for cubic symbols
seems to be new. As far as we know, neither was analyzed before. We show that

cubic algorithm involves a cyclic repetition of four quotients, which may be of
independent interest.

Apache Spark Streaming (under file-, TCP socket- and Kafka-based stream
integration), with a prototype P2P stream processing framework, HarmonicIO.
Maximum throughput for a spectrum of stream processing loads are measured,
specifically, those with large message sizes (up to 10MB), and heavy CPU loads
-- more typical of scientific computing use cases (such as microscopy), than
enterprise contexts. A detailed exploration of the performance characteristics
with these streaming sources, under varying loads, reveals an interplay of
performance trade-offs, uncovering the boundaries of good performance for each
framework and streaming source integration. We compare with theoretic bounds in
each case. Based on these results, we suggest which frameworks and streaming
sources are likely to offer good performance for a given load. Broadly, the
advantages of Spark's rich feature set comes at a cost of sensitivity to
message size in particular -- common stream source integrations can perform
poorly in the 1MB-10MB range. The simplicity of HarmonicIO offers more robust
performance in this region, especially for raw CPU utilization.

adjacent toroidal lenses (""saddle lenses"") in combination with standard optical
components. Its variable magnification is adjusted by a mere rotation of the
four saddle lenses around the optical axis. This avoids the necessity of
classical zoom systems to shift multiple lenses along the longitudinal axis of
the setup. A rotationally tunable pair of saddle lens consists of two
individual saddle lenses (also known as quadrupole lenses, or biconic lenses),
which are arranged directly behind each other, acting as a ""combi-saddle lens"".
The transmission function of such a combi-saddle lens corresponds to that of a
single saddle lens, but with an adjustable optical power which depends on the
mutual rotation angle between its two components. The optical system contains
two of these combi-saddle lenses, and acts as a cylindrical Kepler telescope in
one plane, and as a cylindrical Galilei telescope in the orthogonal plane. The
two orthogonal Kepler/Galilei telescopes stay aligned and change their
magnification factors in the same way when the telescope is zoomed by adjusting
the optical powers of the two combi-saddle lenses. Altogether this produces a
sharp image which is mirrored with respect to the axis of the Kepler telescope.
Thus, in addition to the zooming capabilities of the telescope, it is also
possible to rotate the resulting image by a rotation of the whole telescope, or
of all included saddle lenses. We theoretically explain the operation principle
of the telescope in both, a ray-optical and a wave-optical description.

outstanding problems in this context is the stick-slip instability, observed
above a critical velocity, during which the contact line periodically depins
from its own wetting ridge. Time-resolved measurements of the solid deformation
are challenging, and the mechanism of dynamical depinning has remained elusive.
Here we present direct visualisations of the dynamic wetting ridge formed by
water spreading on a PDMS gel. Unexpectedly, it is found that the opening angle
of the wetting ridge increases with speed, which cannot be attributed to bulk
rheology, but points to a dynamical increase of the solid's surface tensions.
From this we derive the criterion for depinning that is confirmed
experimentally. Our findings reveal a deep connection between stick-slip
processes and newly identified dynamical surface effects.

workflow for deploying a Platform as a Service (PaaS) in an open foundry
environment, but also the Telco business as well as operational models to
achieve an economy of scope and an economy of scale. (2) For that purpose, we
construct an integrative platform business model in the form of a Multi-Sided
Platform (MSP) for building Telco PaaSes. The proposed MSP based architecture
enables a multi-organizational ecosystem with increased automation
possibilities for Telco-grade service creation and operation. The paper
describes how the Dev-for-Operations and MSP lift constraints and offers an
effective way for next-generation PaaS building, while mutually reinforcing
each other in the Next Generation Platform as a Service (NGPaaS) framework.

robot's trajectory. In particular, we first use an occupancy map to summarize
human's movement preference over time, and such prior information is then
considered in an optimization-based motion planner via two cost items as
introduced in [1]: 1) avoidance of the workspace previously occupied by human,
to eliminate the interruption and to increase the task success rate; 2)
tendency to keep a safe distance between the human and the robot to improve the

where no human-related factors are considered. The trajectories generated are
tested in both simulated and real-world environments, and the results show that

Boundary Method (SBM) recently proposed. This approach is based on the idea of
shifting the location of true boundary conditions to a surrogate boundary, with
the goal of avoiding cut cells near the boundary of the computational domain.
This combination of methodologies has multiple advantages. In the first place,
since the Shifted Boundary Method always relies on the same background mesh,
there is no need to update the discretized parametric domain. Secondly, we
avoid the treatment of cut cell elements, which usually need particular
attention. Thirdly, since the whole background mesh is considered in the
reduced basis construction, the SBM allows for a smooth transition of the
reduced modes across the immersed domain boundary. The performances of the
method are verified in two dimensional heat transfer numerical examples.

  with unobserved variables",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The edge structure of the graph defining an undirected graphical model
describes precisely the structure of dependence between the variables in the
graph. In many applications, the dependence structure is unknown and it is
desirable to learn it from data, often because it is a preliminary step to be
able to ascertain causal effects. This problem, known as structure learning, is
hard in general, but for Gaussian graphical models it is slightly easier
because the structure of the graph is given by the sparsity pattern of the
precision matrix of the joint distribution, and because independence coincides
with decorrelation. A major difficulty too often ignored in structure learning
is the fact that if some variables are not observed, the marginal dependence
graph over the observed variables will possibly be significantly more complex
and no longer reflect the direct dependencies that are potentially associated
with causal effects. In this work, we consider a family of latent variable
Gaussian graphical models in which the graph of the joint distribution between
observed and unobserved variables is sparse, and the unobserved variables are
conditionally independent given the others. Prior work was able to recover the
connectivity between observed variables, but could only identify the subspace
spanned by unobserved variables, whereas we propose a convex optimization
formulation based on structured matrix sparsity to estimate the complete
connectivity of the complete graph including unobserved variables, given the
knowledge of the number of missing variables, and a priori knowledge of their
level of connectivity. Our formulation is supported by a theoretical result of
identifiability of the latent dependence structure for sparse graphs in the
infinite data limit. We propose an algorithm leveraging recent active set
methods, which performs well in the experiments on synthetic data.

analysis that quantifies the amplification of deterministic disturbances at a

amplification of a cascade of streamwise scales throughout the streamwise

captured by conducting locally parallel analysis at various streamwise

Our research is based on a model of knowledge diffusion applied to a
time-varying adaptive network, and considers two well-known strategies for
influencing social contexts. One is the selection of few influencers for
manipulating their actions in order to drive the whole network to a certain
behavior; the other, instead, drives the network behavior acting on the state
of a large subset of ordinary, scarcely influencing users. The two approaches
have been studied in terms of network and diffusion effects. The network effect
is analyzed through the changes induced on network average degree and
clustering coefficient, while the diffusion effect is based on two ad-hoc
metrics defined to measure the degree of knowledge diffusion and skill level,
as well as the polarization of agent interests. The results, obtained through
simulations on synthetic networks, show a rich dynamics and strong effects on
the communication structure and on the distribution of knowledge and skills,
supporting our hypothesis that the strategic use of random information could
represent a realistic approach to social network controllability, and that with

This equivalence which applies in the absence of any supersymmetry, is however
restricted by the presence of topological terms generating possible topological
effects. In particular in 3+1 dimensions the duality relations between the
Maxwell-Higgs model, the Stueckelberg and the topological mass generation

design of flow field in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). We focus on
generating a novel flow field configuration for VRFBs via topology
optimization, which has been attracted attention as a powerful design tool
based on numerical optimization. An attractive feature of topology optimization
is that a topology optimized configuration can be automatically generated
without presetting a promising design candidate. In this paper, we formulate
the topology optimization problem as a maximization problem of the electrode
surface concentration in the negative electrode during the charging process.
The aim of this optimization problem is to obtain a topology optimized flow
field that enables the improvement of mass transfer effect in a VRFB. We
demonstrate that a novel flow field configuration can be obtained through the
numerical investigation. To clarify the performance of the topology optimized
flow field, we investigate the mass transfer effect through the comparison with
reference flow fields---parallel and interdigitated flow fields---and the
topology optimized flow field. In addition, we discuss the power loss that
takes account of the polarization loss and pumping power, at various operating
conditions.

We establish these conditions for various examples, such as the
(vertex-weighted) exponential random graph model, the random coloring and the
hard-core model with fugacity. This leads to two separate branches of
applications. The first branch is given by mixing time estimates of the Glauber
dynamics. The proofs do not rely on coupling arguments, but instead use
functional inequalities. As a byproduct, this also yields exponential decay of
the relative entropy along the Glauber semigroup. Secondly, we investigate the
concentration of measure phenomenon (particularly of higher order) for these
spin systems. We show the effect of better concentration properties by
centering not around the mean, but a stochastic term in the exponential random
graph model. From there, one can deduce a central limit theorem for the number
of triangles from the CLT of the edge count. In the Erd\""os-R\'enyi model the
first order approximation leads to a quantification and a proof of a central

angle of incidence, almost as large as 80% of the laser ($p$-polarized) energy
gets absorbed in the target. Such a high percentage of absorption at
near-relativistic intensities has not been observed before. At smaller angles

improvement of the tracking precision and efficiency, in particular in the
low-momentum range; ii) an improvement of the readout capabilities of the
experiment, in order to fully exploit the luminosity for heavy ions envisaged
after LS2. The first goal will be achieved by replacing the Inner Tracking

The new tracker will be made up of about 25000 Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors
with fast readout, resulting in a material thickness reduced to 0.3% (inner

$28\times28$ $\mu$m$^2$. The second goal will be achieved, among other
measures, by replacing the readout chambers of the 90 m$^3$ Time Projection
Chamber with Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors. In particular, the new readout
chambers will consist of stacks of 4 Gas Electron Multiplier foils combining
different hole pitches. The upgraded detector will operate continuously without
the use of a triggered gating grid. It will thus be able to record all Pb--Pb

task-specific similarity from weakly supervised data. However, these methods
are subject to the curse of dimensionality: as the number of features grows
large, poor generalization is to be expected and training becomes intractable
due to high computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a
similarity learning method that can efficiently deal with high-dimensional
sparse data. This is achieved through a parameterization of similarity
functions by convex combinations of sparse rank-one matrices, together with the
use of a greedy approximate Frank-Wolfe algorithm which provides an efficient
way to control the number of active features. We show that the convergence rate
of the algorithm, as well as its time and memory complexity, are independent of
the data dimension. We further provide a theoretical justification of our
modeling choices through an analysis of the generalization error, which depends
logarithmically on the sparsity of the solution rather than on the number of
features. Our experiments on datasets with up to one million features
demonstrate the ability of our approach to generalize well despite the high
dimensionality as well as its superiority compared to several competing
methods.

Method (SBM) with a POD-Galerkin strategy. This approach allows to treat more
complex parametrized domains in an efficient and straightforward way. The
impact of the proposed approach is threefold.
  First, problems involving parametrizations of complex geometrical shapes
and/or large domain deformations can be efficiently solved at full-order by
means of the SBM, an unfitted boundary method that avoids remeshing and the
tedious handling of cut cells by introducing an approximate surrogate boundary.
  Second, the computational effort is further reduced by the development of a
reduced order model (ROM) technique based on a POD-Galerkin approach.
  Third, the SBM provides a smooth mapping from the true to the surrogate
domain, and for this reason, the stability and performance of the reduced order
basis are enhanced. This feature is the net result of the combination of the
proposed ROM approach and the SBM. Similarly, the combination of the SBM with a
projection-based ROM gives the great advantage of an easy and fast to implement
algorithm considering geometrical parametrization with large deformations. The
transformation of each geometry to a reference geometry (morphing) is in fact
not required.
  These combined advantages will allow the solution of PDE problems more
efficiently. We illustrate the performance of this approach on a number of
two-dimensional Stokes flow problems.

suitable choice of Hessenberg variety. It is then natural to imagine the Toda
lattice as extending to an appropriate union of Hessenberg varieties.
  We fix a simply-connected complex semisimple linear algebraic group $G$ and
restrict our attention to a particular family of Hessenberg varieties, a family
that includes the Peterson variety and all Toda leaf compactifications. The
total space of this family, $X(H_0)$, is shown to be a Poisson variety with a

whose center symmetry is gauged and has the advantage that the topological term
is correctly quantized so that $2\pi$ periodicity in $\theta$ is intact.
Because of this the $\theta = \pi$ theory has an exact $Z_2$ charge-conjugation
symmetry $C$, which is spontaneously broken when the mass-squared of the
scalars is large and positive. Lowering the mass squared the symmetry becomes
restored in a second order phase transition. Simulating the system at $\theta =

function of the mass parameter. Using a finite size scaling analysis we
determine the critical exponents and show that the transition is in the 2d
Ising universality class, as expected.

deletion of non-individually-rational strategy profiles until at most one
remains. In this paper, we characterize the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium
with adapted Kripke models having necessary rationality, necessary knowledge of
strategies as well as eventual logical omniscience.
  Eventual logical omniscience is introduced as a weaker version of perfect
logical omniscience, with logical omniscience being quantized and fading away
counterfactually. It is the price to pay for necessary factual omniscience and
necessary rationality: we conjecture that epistemic omniscience, logical
omniscience and necessary rationality form an impossibility triangle.
  We consider multimodal classes of Kripke structures, with respect to agents,
but also in the sense that we have both epistemic and logical accessibility
relations. Knowledge is defined in terms of the former, while necessity is
defined in terms of the latter. Lewisian closest-state functions, which are not
restricted to unilateral deviations, model counterfactuals.
  We use impossible possible worlds \`a la Rantala to model that some strategy
profiles cannot possibly be reached in some situations. Eventual logical
omniscience is then bootstrapped with the agents' considering that, at
logically possible, but non-normal worlds \`a la Kripke, any world is logically
accessible and thus any deviation of strategy is possible. As in known in
literature, under rationality and knowledge of strategies, these worlds
characterize individual rationality. Then, in normal worlds, higher levels of

high-enough level of logical omniscience characterizes, when it exists, the

waiting time pdfs is provided. The equation takes the form of a generalized
Fokker-Planck equation when the jump length pdf of the particle has a finite
variance. This generalized equation becomes a fractional Fokker-Planck equation
in the case of a heavy-tailed waiting time pdf. These equations allow us to
study the relationship between expansion, diffusion and external force. We
establish the conditions under which the dominant contribution to transport
stems from the diffusive transport rather than from the drift due to the medium

lead to propagators that are qualitatively different from the ones found in a

associated ion acceleration by the sub-wavelength target. In the chirped laser
pulses, the pulse frequency has a temporal variation about its fundamental
frequency,
  which manifests to the temporal dependence of the critical density ($n_c$).
In this work we used a chirp model which is beyond the linear approximation.
For negatively (positively) chirped pulses, the high (low) frequency component
of the pulse interacts with the target initially followed by the low (high)
frequency component. The threshold plasma density for the transmission of the
pulse is found to be higher for the negatively chirped laser pulses as compared
to the unchirped or positively chirped pulses. The enhanced transmission of the
negatively chirped pulses for higher densities ($6n_c$) results in very
efficient heating of the target electrons, creating a very stable and
persistent longitudinal electrostatic field behind the target. The void of the
electrons results in expansion of the target ions in either direction,
resulting in the broad energy spectrum. We have introduced a very thin, low
density ($< n_c$) secondary layer behind the primary layer. The ions from the
secondary layer are then found to be accelerated as a mono-energetic bunch
under the influence of the electrostatic field created by the primary layer
upon interaction by the negatively chirped pulse. Under the optimum conditions,
the maximum energy of the protons are found to be $\sim 100$ MeV for 10 fs

by the scatter matrix while the non-parametric, infinite-dimensional, part is
represented by the density generator. Since, in practical applications, we are

and allowed for large deformations. Though results were largely in agreement
with experiment that focus on the migration of a soft cancer cell in a
confluent layer of normal cells \cite{Lee2012}, simulations required large

derive a sharp interface limit of CPF, including all interactions and

original CPF implementation. We demonstrate that this model captures similar
behavior and allows us to obtain new results that were previously intractable.
We obtain the full velocity distribution for a large range of degrees of
confluence, $\rho$, and show regimes where its tail is heavier and lighter than
a normal distribution. Furthermore, we fully characterize the velocity
distribution with a single parameter, and its dependence on $\rho$ is fully
determined. Finally, cell motility is shown to linearly decrease with
increasing $\rho$, consistent with previous theoretical results.

systems, which can be of generic linear or Lipschitz nonlinear type,
communicating over directed switching network topologies. A mild connectivity
assumption on the switching topologies is imposed, which allows them to be
directed and jointly connected. We propose a novel analysis framework from both
algebraic and geometric perspectives to justify the attractiveness of the
synchronization manifold. Specifically, it is proven that the complementary
space of the synchronization manifold can be spanned by certain subspaces.
These subspaces can be the eigenspaces of the nonzero eigenvalues of Laplacian
matrices in linear case. They can also be subspaces in which the projection of
the nonlinear self-dynamics still retains the Lipschitz property. This allows
to project the states of the dynamical systems into these subspaces and
transform the synchronization problem under consideration equivalently into a
convergence one of the projected states in each subspace. Then, assuming the
joint connectivity condition on the communication topologies, we are able to
work out a simple yet effective and unified convergence analysis for both types
of dynamical systems. More specifically, for partial-state coupled generic
linear systems, it is proven that synchronization can be reached if an extra
condition, which is easy to verify in several cases, on the system dynamics is
satisfied. For Lipschitz-type nonlinear systems with positive-definite inner
coupling matrix, synchronization is realized if the coupling strength is strong
enough to stabilize the evolution of the projected states in each subspace
under certain conditions.

challenge in condensed matter physics and material science. Sometimes, however,
traditional electrical conductance or resistance measurements only provide very
small signals, and thus limit the ability to obtain direct band structure
information. In this case, it has been proven beneficial to employ
thermoelectric measurements which are sensitive to the first derivative of the
density of states with respect to energy, rather than to its value itself. Due
to the large interest in topological effects these days, it is important to
identify a similar concept for detecting the Berry curvature in a band
structure. Nowadays, the common way to access the Berry curvature directly via
measurements is the anomalous Hall effect, but the corresponding signal can be
too small to be detected when the topological features of the band structure
lie too far off the Fermi level. In this work we propose to investigate
topological band structure features utilizing the anomalous Nernst effect which
is tied to the derivative of the anomalous Hall effect with respect to energy.
Thereby, also signatures become resolvable, which are elusive in anomalous Hall
measurements. We demonstrate the underlying mechanisms for a minimal effective
four-band model and exemplary for the real Heusler compounds Co$_2$Fe$X$
($X$=Ge,Sn), which host topological nodal lines about 100 meV above the Fermi
level. This work demonstrates that anomalous Nernst measurements can be an
effective tool for the characterization of topological band structures, both at
room temperature and in the quantum transport regime at cryogenic temperatures.

their environments is fundamental to a range of cellular behaviours, with
substrate stiffness increasingly being found to be a key signalling factor.
Although active contractility of the cytoskeleton is clearly necessary for
stiffness sensing in cells, the physical mechanisms connecting contractility
with mechanosensing and molecular conformational change are not well
understood. Here we present a contractility-driven mechanism for linking
changes in substrate stiffness with internal conformational changes. Cellular
contractility is often assumed to imply an associated compressive strain. We
show, however, that where the contractility is non-uniform, localized areas of
internal stretch can be generated as stiffer substrates are encountered. This
suggests a physical mechanism for the stretch-activation of mechanotransductive
molecules on stiffer substrates. Importantly, the areas of internal stretch are
not co-localized with those traditionally associated with stiffness sensing,
e.g. focal adhesions, supporting recent experimental results on whole-cell
mechanically-driven mechanotransduction. Considering cellular shape we show
that aspect ratio acts as an additional control parameter, so that the onset of
positive strain moves to higher stiffness values in elliptical cells.

dramatically (69% vs. 75% mean accuracy). Finally, a long short-term memory

CNN features with 'elapsed time', increasing the accuracy to 86%. Our results
highlight the prominent role of visual saliency, long-range temporal recursion

(SLSN) showing no relatively narrow features in its early-time spectra, and
therefore its powering mechanism is under debate between circumstellar
interaction (CSI) and magnetar spin-down. Late-time data are required for
better constraints. We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry
obtained from Gemini, Keck, and Palomar Observatories from 192 to 554 days
after explosion. Only broad H$\alpha$ emission is detected in a Gemini spectrum
at 288 days. The line profile exhibits red-wing attenuation relative to the
early-time spectrum. In addition to the cooling SN photosphere, a NIR excess
with blackbody temperature $\sim1500$ K and radius $\sim10^{16}$ cm is
observed. This evidence supports dust condensation in the cool dense shell
being responsible for the spectral evolution and NIR excess. We favour CSI,
with $\sim2$--3 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ of circumstellar material (CSM) and
$\sim$10--20 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ of ejecta, as the powering mechanism, which
still dominates at our late-time epochs. Both models of uniform density and
steady wind fit the data equally well, with an effective CSM radius $\sim
10^{15}$ cm, supporting the efficient conversion of shock energy to radiation
by CSI. A low amount ($\lesssim 0.4$ $\textrm{M}_\odot$) of $^{56}$Ni is
possible but cannot be verified yet, since the light curve is dominated by CSI.
The magnetar spin-down powering mechanism cannot be ruled out, but is less
favoured because it overpredicts the late-time fluxes and may be inconsistent
with the presence of dust.

lip motion and speech. In this work, we integrate both aspects and enable
arbitrary-subject talking face generation by learning disentangled audio-visual

composition of both subject-related information and speech-related information.
These two spaces are then explicitly disentangled through a novel
associative-and-adversarial training process. This disentangled representation
has an advantage where both audio and video can serve as inputs for generation.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach generates realistic

coating, gives rise to strong electric-field at the near-field of tip apex,

axial direction. This strong near-field enables resolving molecular landscape
or nano-scale defects on crystal surfaces in apertureless scanning near field
optical microscopy or tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy applications. However,
strong near fields appear only at certain illumination wavelengths at which
material and geometry dependent plasmon resonances take place. Once the metal
coated tip is manufactured, optimal operation wavelength remains fixed since
the material and geometry of the tip apex remains fixed. Here, we show for the
first time a method which renders an AFM tip useful at wavelengths off-resonant
to its plasmon resonances. The technique relies on decoration of the tip with
appropriate auxiliary molecules. For instance, a tip originally bearing a
plasmon resonance at $\lambda_{\rm p}=581$ nm can be effectively operated
off-resonantly at $\lambda_{\rm exc}=532$ nm, when it is decorated by an
appropriate auxiliary molecule. Furthermore, the near-field is found to be
strongest just below the auxiliary molecule which enables a

found for the free energy in $D$ rectilinear spacetime dimensions with $c\le

systems are unable to benefit from unlabelled data which may be available in

labelling a given input image. Humans, on the other hand, regularly perform
identification of individuals completely unsupervised, recognising the identity

more human understanding of identities? We propose an integrated Bayesian model
that coherently reasons about the observed images, identities, partial
knowledge about names, and the situational context of each observation. While
our model achieves good recognition performance against known identities, it
can also discover new identities from unsupervised data and learns to associate
identities with different contexts depending on which identities tend to be

security in a wireless communication system, however, there are few studies
taking it into consideration. Existing work on information leakage rate has two
major limitations due to the complicated expression for the leakage rate: 1)
the analytical and numerical results give few insights into the trade-off
between system throughput and information leakage rate; 2) and the
corresponding optimal designs of transmission rates are not analytically
tractable. To overcome such limitations and obtain an in-depth understanding of
information leakage rate in secure wireless communications, we propose an
approximation for the average information leakage rate in the fixed-rate
transmission scheme. Different from the complicated expression for information
leakage rate in the literature, our proposed approximation has a low-complexity
expression, and hence, it is easy for further analysis. Based on our
approximation, the corresponding approximate optimal transmission rates are
obtained for two transmission schemes with different design objectives. Through
analytical and numerical results, we find that for the system maximizing
throughput subject to information leakage rate constraint, the throughput is an
upward convex non-decreasing function of the security constraint and much too
loose security constraint does not contribute to higher throughput; while for
the system minimizing information leakage rate subject to throughput
constraint, the average information leakage rate is a lower convex increasing
function of the throughput constraint.

bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate
program inputs to exercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code
that is guarded by complex checks.
  In this paper, we present a technique that extends greybox fuzzing with a
method for learning new inputs based on already explored program executions.
These inputs can be learned such that they guide exploration toward specific
executions, for instance, ones that increase path coverage or reveal
vulnerabilities. We have evaluated our technique and compared it to traditional
greybox fuzzing on 26 real-world benchmarks. In comparison, our technique
significantly increases path coverage (by up to 3X) and detects more bugs (up

provisioning of network services and is attracting a lot of attention. NFV can
be implemented in commercial off-the-shelf servers or Physical Machines (PMs),
and many network services can be offered as a sequence of Virtual Network
Functions (VNFs), known as VNF chains. Furthermore, many existing network
devices (e.g., switches) and collocated PMs are underutilized or
over-provisioned, resulting in low power-efficiency. In order to achieve more
energy efficient systems, this work aims at designing the placement of VNFs
such that the total power consumption in network nodes and PMs is minimized,
while meeting the delay and capacity requirements of the foreseen demands.
Based on existing switch and PM power models, we propose a Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) formulation to find the optimal solution. We also propose a
heuristic based on the concept of Blocking Islands (BI), and a baseline
heuristic based on the Betweenness Centrality (BC) property of the graph. Both
heuristics and the ILP solutions have been compared in terms of total power
consumption, delay, demands acceptance rate, and computation time. Our
simulation results suggest that BI-based heuristic is superior compared with
the BC-based heuristic, and very close to the optimal solution obtained from
the ILP in terms of total power consumption and demands acceptance rate.
Compared to the ILP, the proposed BI-based heuristic is significantly faster
and results in 22% lower end-to-end delay, with a penalty of consuming 6% more
power in average.

is very computationally efficient and provides a simple interpretation of the
collision. Unfortunately, it is not valid at energies around 10 MeV/nucleon,
the range of energy of HIE-ISOLDE at CERN and the future ReA12 at MSU. Fukui
etal. [Phys. Rev. C 90, 034617 (2014)] have shown that a simple semiclassical
correction of the projectile-target deflection could improve the description of
breakup of halo nuclei on heavy targets down to 20 MeV/nucleon.
  Purpose: We study two similar corrections, which aim at improving the
projectile-target relative motion within the eikonal approximation, with the
goal to extend its range of validity down to 10 MeV/nucleon in
nuclear-dominated collisions, viz. on light targets. The semiclassical
correction substitutes the impact parameter by the distance of closest approach
of the corresponding classical trajectory. The exact continued $S$-matrix
correction replaces the eikonal phase by the exact phase shift. Both
corrections successfully describe the elastic scattering of one-neutron halo
nuclei.
  Method: We extend these corrections and study their efficiency in describing
the breakup channel. We evaluate them in the case of $^{11}\mathrm{Be}$
impinging on $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at 20 and 10 MeV/nucleon.
  Results: Albeit efficient to reproduce the elastic channel, these corrections
do not improve the description of the breakup of halo nuclei within the eikonal
approximation down to 20 MeV/nucleon.
  Conclusions: Our analysis of these corrections shows that improving the
projectile-target relative motion is not the ultimate answer to extend the
eikonal approximation down to low energies. We suggest another avenue to reach
this goal.

to quantify the ``leakage'' of information from $X$ to $Y$. The resulting
measure $\mathcal{L}(X \!\! \to \!\! Y)$ is called \emph{maximal leakage}, and
is defined as the multiplicative increase, upon observing $Y$, of the
probability of correctly guessing a randomized function of $X$, maximized over
all such randomized functions. A closed-form expression for $\mathcal{L}(X \!\!
\to \!\! Y)$ is given for discrete $X$ and $Y$, and it is subsequently
generalized to handle a large class of random variables. The resulting
properties are shown to be consistent with an axiomatic view of a leakage
measure, and the definition is shown to be robust to variations in the setup.
Moreover, a variant of the Shannon cipher system is studied, in which
performance of an encryption scheme is measured using maximal leakage. A
single-letter characterization of the optimal limit of (normalized) maximal
leakage is derived and asymptotically-optimal encryption schemes are
demonstrated. Furthermore, the sample complexity of estimating maximal leakage
from data is characterized up to subpolynomial factors. Finally, the
\emph{guessing} framework used to define maximal leakage is used to give
operational interpretations of commonly used leakage measures, such as Shannon
capacity, maximal correlation, and local differential privacy.

L\'evy Flights (LFs) or L\'evy Walks (LWs). LFs get anomalous scaling, but also
infinite position variance and also infinite energy and discontinuous velocity.
LWs are based on random trapping events, resemble a L\'evy-type power-law
distribution that is truncated in the large displacement range and have finite
moments, finite energy and discontinuous velocity. However, both LFs and LWs
cannot describe friction-diffusion processes. We propose and discuss a model
describing a Heterogeneous Ensemble of Brownian Particles (HEBP) based on a
linear Langevin equation. We show that, for proper distributions of relaxation
time and velocity diffusivity, the HEBP displays features similar to LWs, in
particular power-law decaying PDF, long-range correlations and anomalous
diffusion, at the same time keeping finite position moments and finite energy.
The main differences between the HEBP model and two LWs are investigated,
finding that, even if the PDFs are similar, they differ in three main aspects:
(i) LWs are biscaling, while HEBP is monoscaling; (ii) a transition from
anomalous ($\delta \ne 1/2$) to normal ($\delta = 1/2$) diffusion in the
long-time regime; (iii) the power-law index of the position PDF and the
space/time diffusion scaling are independent in the HEBP, while they both
depend on the scaling of the inter-event time PDF in LWs. The HEBP model is
derived from a friction-diffusion process, it has finite energy and it
satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

adding to it isometries, which transform as tensors under gauge transformations

learning (e.g., feature engineering and active learning). For many large-scale
optimization problems, we are often concerned with the adaptivity complexity of
an algorithm, which quantifies the number of sequential rounds where
polynomially-many independent function evaluations can be executed in parallel.
While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for a distributed algorithm
to be efficient, since in many practical applications of submodular
optimization the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively
expensive. Motivated by these applications, we study the adaptivity and query
complexity of adaptive submodular optimization.
  Our main result is a distributed algorithm for maximizing a monotone
submodular function with cardinality constraint $k$ that achieves a
$(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$-approximation in expectation. This algorithm runs in
$O(\log(n))$ adaptive rounds and makes $O(n)$ calls to the function evaluation
oracle in expectation. The approximation guarantee and query complexity are
optimal, and the adaptivity is nearly optimal. Moreover, the number of queries
is substantially less than in previous works. Last, we extend our results to
the submodular cover problem to demonstrate the generality of our algorithm and

their size in response to a temperature variation. This peculiar feature is
driven by the nature of the solvent-polymer interactions, which triggers the
so-called volume phase transition from a swollen to a collapsed state above a
characteristic temperature. Recently, an advanced modelling protocol to
assemble realistic, disordered microgels has been shown to reproduce
experimental swelling behavior and form factors. In the original framework, the
solvent was taken into account in an implicit way, condensing solvent-polymer
interactions in an effective attraction between monomers. To go one step
further, in this work we perform simulations of realistic microgels in an
explicit solvent. We identify a suitable model which fully captures the main
features of the implicit model and further provides information on the solvent
uptake by the interior of the microgel network and on its role in the collapse
kinetics. These results pave the way for addressing problems where solvent
effects are dominant, such as the case of microgels at liquid-liquid
interfaces.

magnetization dynamics requests a proper theoretical description, especially in
the context of a microscopic framework, to be developed. Indeed, magnetization
dynamics is so far approached within Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation which
characterizes torques on magnetization on purely phenomenological grounds.
Particularly, spin-orbit coupling does not respect spin conservation, leading
thus to angular momentum transfer to lattice and damping as a result. This
mechanism is accounted by the Gilbert damping torque which describes relaxation
of the magnetization to equilibrium. In this study we work out a microscopic
Kubo-St\v{r}eda formula for the components of the Gilbert damping tensor and
apply the elaborated formalism to a two-dimensional Rashba ferromagnet in the

to the Gilbert damping parameter manifests linear dependence on the scattering

\cfour \,absorbers trace $M_{\text{UV}}\lesssim -16$ galaxies. Correlation with
the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of the QSOs indicates that these objects are
surrounded by a highly opaque region at $r\lesssim 5 $ cMpc/h followed by an
excess of transmission at $r\gtrsim 10$ cMpc/h detected at $2.7\sigma$. This is
in contrast to equivalent measurements at lower redshifts where only the opaque
trough is detected. We interpret this excess as a statistical enhancement of
the local photoionisation rate due to clustered faint galaxies around the
\cfour \,absorbers. Using the analytical framework described in Paper I of this

Fourier domain. We review the Fourier domain acceleration search (FDAS), which
uses a matched filtering algorithm to correct for this smearing by assuming
constant acceleration for a small enough portion of the orbit. We discuss the
theory and implementation of a Fourier domain ""jerk"" search, developed as part
of the \textsc{PRESTO} software package, which extends the FDAS to account for
a linearly changing acceleration, or constant orbital jerk, of the pulsar. We
test the performance of our algorithm on archival Green Bank Telescope

search has a significantly longer runtime, it improves search sensitivity to
binaries when the observation duration is $5$ to $15\%$ of the orbital period.

  Storage",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shared memory emulation can be used as a fault-tolerant and highly available
distributed storage solution or as a low-level synchronization primitive.
Attiya, Bar-Noy, and Dolev were the first to propose a single-writer,
multi-reader linearizable register emulation where the register is replicated
to all servers. Recently, Cadambe et al. proposed the Coded Atomic Storage
(CAS) algorithm, which uses erasure coding for achieving data redundancy with
much lower communication cost than previous algorithmic solutions.
  Although CAS can tolerate server crashes, it was not designed to recover from
unexpected, transient faults, without the need of external (human)
intervention. In this respect, Dolev, Petig, and Schiller have recently
developed a self-stabilizing version of CAS, which we call CASSS. As one would
expect, self-stabilization does not come as a free lunch; it introduces,
mainly, communication overhead for detecting inconsistencies and stale
information. So, one would wonder whether the overhead introduced by
self-stabilization would nullify the gain of erasure coding.
  To answer this question, we have implemented and experimentally evaluated the
CASSS algorithm on PlanetLab; a planetary scale distributed infrastructure. The
evaluation shows that our implementation of CASSS scales very well in terms of
the number of servers, the number of concurrent clients, as well as the size of
the replicated object. More importantly, it shows (a) to have only a constant
overhead compared to the traditional CAS algorithm (which we also implement)
and (b) the recovery period (after the last occurrence of a transient fault) is
as fast as a few client (read/write) operations. Our results suggest that CASSS
does not significantly impact efficiency while dealing with automatic recovery
from transient faults and bounded size of needed resources.

calculate the electromagnetic emission from WD-WD mergers and compare with
kilonova observations. We simulate WD-WD mergers leading to a massive, fast
rotating, highly magnetized WD with an adapted version of the
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom. We thus obtain initial
conditions for the ejecta such as escape velocity, mass and initial position
and distribution. The subsequent thermal and dynamical evolution of the ejecta
is obtained by integrating the energy-conservation equation accounting for
expansion cooling and a heating source given by the fallback accretion onto the
newly-formed WD and its magneto-dipole radiation. We show that magnetospheric
processes in the merger can lead to a prompt, short gamma-ray emission of up to
$\approx 10^{46}$ erg in a timescale of $0.1$-$1$ s. The bulk of the ejecta
initially expands non-relativistically with velocity $0.01 c$ and then it
accelerates to $0.1 c$ due to the injection of fallback accretion energy. The
ejecta become transparent at optical wavelengths around $\sim 7$ days
post-merger with a luminosity $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray
emission from the fallback accretion becomes visible around $\sim 150$-$200$

However, it is often expensive and time-consuming to acquire sufficient labeled
activity data. To solve this problem, transfer learning leverages the labeled
samples from the source domain to annotate the target domain which has few or
none labels. Unfortunately, when there are several source domains available, it
is difficult to select the right source domains for transfer. The right source
domain means that it has the most similar properties with the target domain,
thus their similarity is higher, which can facilitate transfer learning.
Choosing the right source domain helps the algorithm perform well and prevents
the negative transfer. In this paper, we propose an effective Unsupervised
Source Selection algorithm for Activity Recognition (USSAR). USSAR is able to
select the most similar $K$ source domains from a list of available domains.
After this, we propose an effective Transfer Neural Network to perform
knowledge transfer for Activity Recognition (TNNAR). TNNAR could capture both
the time and spatial relationship between activities while transferring
knowledge. Experiments on three public activity recognition datasets
demonstrate that: 1) The USSAR algorithm is effective in selecting the best
source domains. 2) The TNNAR method can reach high accuracy when performing
activity knowledge transfer.

speedup factor of partitioned-EDF is challenging to analyze and is far from

Fisher [1], and was shown to have a speedup factor at most 3-1/m, meaning that
if the input of sporadic tasks is feasible on m processors with speed one,
partitioned-EDF will always return succeeded on m processors with speed 3-1/m.
In 2011, this upper bound was improved to 2.6322-1/m by Chen and Chakraborty

will be to detect systematic energy trends in the composition of the various
particles. It could be a key to identifying {\it families} of bound states,
rather than individual cases. Numerical results based upon a set of parameters
derived from a phenomenological model of tetraquarks are given.

collected by a network of sensors that operate under resource constraints. When
the dynamics of the process and sensor observations are described by a
state-space model and the resource are unlimited, the conventional Kalman
filter provides the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimates. However, at any
given time, restrictions on the available communications bandwidth and
computational capabilities and/or power impose a limitation on the number of
network nodes whose observations can be used to compute the estimates. We
formulate the problem of selecting the most informative subset of the sensors
as a combinatorial problem of maximizing a monotone set function under a
uniform matroid constraint. For the MMSE estimation criterion we show that the
maximum element-wise curvature of the objective function satisfies a certain
upper-bound constraint and is, therefore, weak submodular. We develop an
efficient randomized greedy algorithm for sensor selection and establish
guarantees on the estimator's performance in this setting. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate the efficacy of the randomized greedy algorithm compared to
state-of-the-art greedy and semidefinite programming relaxation methods.

diamagnetism is a complex and elusive effect requiring laborious computations.
Here based on the semi-classical treatment of the problem I present a clear
picture of the Landau diamagnetism at zero temperature, which offers a simple
derivation of this effect and leads to important consequences: 1) the
diamagnetic response is due to electron states in a very narrow Fermi surface
region in the k-space, 2) small Fermi energy oscillations in an applied
magnetic field are caused by redistribution (inflow or outflow) of electrons
from the equatorial region of the Fermi surface. The consideration is based on
a structure called magnetic tube whose electron states surround a certain
Landau level in k-space. A completely filled magnetic tube does not change its
energy in an applied magnetic field as if it complied with the Bohr -- van
Leeuwen theorem. The intersection of tubes with the Fermi surface leads to the
appearance of partially occupied tubes in the region of intersection. The
reconstruction of electron states in a magnetic field in this very small narrow
region gives rise to the Landau diamagnetic response. In addition to the Landau
diamagnetism this approach fully describes the oscillatory de Haas - van Alphen
contribution to the magnetic susceptibility from the equatorial region of the
Fermi sphere.

technique for unsteady fluid-structure interaction systems. The proposed
data-driven technique combines the deep learning framework with a
projection-based low-order modeling. While the deep learning provides
low-dimensional approximations from datasets arising from black-box solvers,
the projection-based model constructs the low-dimensional approximations by
projecting the original high-dimensional model onto a low-dimensional subspace.
Of particular interest of this paper is to predict the long time series of
unsteady flow fields of a freely vibrating bluff-body subjected to wake-body
synchronization. We consider convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the
learning dynamics of wake-body interaction, which assemble layers of linear
convolutions with nonlinear activations to automatically extract the
low-dimensional flow features. Using the high-fidelity time series data from
the stabilized finite element Navier-Stokes solver, we first project the
dataset to a low-dimensional subspace by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
technique. The time-dependent coefficients of the POD subspace are mapped to
the flow field via a CNN with nonlinear rectification, and the CNN is
iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method to predict the
POD time coefficient when a new flow field is fed to it. The time-averaged flow
field, the POD basis vectors, and the trained CNN are used to predict the long
time series of the flow fields and the flow predictions are quantitatively
assessed with the full-order (high-dimensional) simulation data. The proposed
POD-CNN model based on the data-driven approximation has a remarkable accuracy
in the entire fluid domain including the highly nonlinear near wake region
behind a freely vibrating bluff body.

dissimilarity is essential to understanding the complex phenomena under study.
However, determining the structural dissimilarity between networks is an
ill-defined problem, as there is no canonical way to compare two networks.
Indeed, many of the existing approaches for network comparison differ in their
heuristics, efficiency, interpretability, and theoretical soundness. Thus,
having a notion of distance that is built on theoretically robust first
principles and that is interpretable with respect to features ubiquitous in
complex networks would allow for a meaningful comparison between different
networks. Here we introduce a theoretically sound and efficient new measure of
graph distance, based on the ""length spectrum"" function from algebraic
topology, which compares the structure of two undirected, unweighted graphs by
considering their non-backtracking cycles. We show how this distance relates to
structural features such as presence of hubs and triangles through the behavior
of the eigenvalues of the so-called non-backtracking matrix, and we showcase
its ability to discriminate between networks in both real and synthetic data
sets. By taking a topological interpretation of non-backtracking cycles, this
work presents a novel application of Topological Data Analysis to the study of
complex networks.
