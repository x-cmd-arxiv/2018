  arXiv:1811.07216",,,"ML4H/2018/172","cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature selection, which searches for the most representative features in
observed data, is critical for health data analysis. Unlike feature extraction,
such as PCA and autoencoder based methods, feature selection preserves
interpretability, meaning that the selected features provide direct information
about certain health conditions (i.e., the label). Thus, feature selection
allows domain experts, such as clinicians, to understand the predictions made
by machine learning based systems, as well as improve their own diagnostic
skills. Mutual information is often used as a basis for feature selection since
it measures dependencies between features and labels. In this paper, we
introduce a novel mutual information based feature selection (MIBFS) method
called SURI, which boosts features with high unique relevant information. We
compare SURI to existing MIBFS methods using 3 different classifiers on 6
publicly available healthcare data sets. The results indicate that, in addition
to preserving interpretability, SURI selects more relevant feature subsets
which lead to higher classification performance. More importantly, we explore
the dynamics of mutual information on a public low-dimensional health data set
via exhaustive search. The results suggest the important role of unique
relevant information in feature selection and verify the principles behind
SURI.

space L_2(\R^d)\,(d\ge 3), with V(x)\ge 0 and V(\cdot)\in L_{1,loc}(\R^d), we
obtain some constructive conditions for discreteness of its spectrum. Basing on
the Mazya-Shubin criterion for discreteness of the spectrum of $H$ and using
the isocapacity inequality and the concept of base polyhedron for the harmonic
capacity, we have estimated from below the cost functional of an optimization
problem, involved in this criterion, replacing a submodular constrain (in terms
of the harmonic capacity) by a weaker but additive constrain (in terms of a
measure). By this way we obtain an optimization problem, which can be
considered as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the optimal covering problem.
We have solved this problem for the case of a non-atomic measure. This approach
enables us to obtain for the operator H some sufficient conditions for
discreteness of its spectrum in terms of non-increasing rearrangements, with
respect to measures from the base polyhedron, for some functions connected with
the potential V(x). We construct some counterexamples, which permit to compare
our results between themselves and with results of other authors.

the overall 9-step score. Importantly, we applied multi-task learning

biological coordination that captures key experimental observations of
mid-scale social coordination at multiple levels of description. It also
reconciles in a single formulation two well-studied models of large- and
small-scale biological coordination (Kuramoto and extended Haken-Kelso-Bunz).
The model adds second-order coupling (from extended Haken-Kelso-Bunz) to the
Kuramoto model. We show that second-order coupling is indispensable for

from mono- to multi-stable coordination across scales. This mono-to-multistable

photodetection, when the detector clicks a photon has been absorbed and
destroyed. Yet the lack of a click also gives information about the presence or

decomposes the strong measurement into a series of weak measurements, which
describe the evolution of the state during the measurement process. Motivated
by this example of destructive photon detection, a simple model of destructive
weak measurements using qubits was studied in [1]. It has shown that the model
can achieve any positive-operator valued measurement (POVM) with commuting POVM
elements including projective measurements. In this paper, we use a different
approach for decomposing any POVM into a series of weak measurements. The
process involves three steps: randomly choose, with certain probabilities, a
set of linearly independent POVM elements; perform that POVM by a series of
destructive weak measurements; output the result of the series of weak
measurements with certain probabilities. The probabilities of the outcomes from
this process agree with those from the original POVM, and hence this model of
destructive weak measurements can perform any qubit POVM.

conditions that are both necessary and sufficient to enabling the recovery of
camera matrices. These conditions are based on arranging the fundamental
matrices as blocks in a single matrix, called the $n$-view fundamental matrix,
and characterizing this matrix in terms of the signs of its eigenvalues and
rank structures. Secondly, we propose a concrete algorithm for projective
structure-from-motion that utilizes this characterization. Given a complete or
partial collection of measured fundamental matrices, our method seeks camera
matrices that minimize a global algebraic error for the measured fundamental

corresponds to a unique set of cameras (up to a choice of projective frame).
Our experiments indicate that our method achieves state of the art performance

developers, targeted advertisements by marketers, and by public policy
researchers to gauge public opinion across demographic groups. Computer
scientists consider the problem of inferring user representations more
abstractly; how does one extract a stable user representation - effective for
many downstream tasks - from a medium as noisy and complicated as social media?
  The quality of a user representation is ultimately task-dependent (e.g. does
it improve classifier performance, make more accurate recommendations in a
recommendation system) but there are proxies that are less sensitive to the
specific task. Is the representation predictive of latent properties such as a
person's demographic features, socioeconomic class, or mental health state? Is
it predictive of the user's future behavior?
  In this thesis, we begin by showing how user representations can be learned
from multiple types of user behavior on social media. We apply several
extensions of generalized canonical correlation analysis to learn these
representations and evaluate them at three tasks: predicting future hashtag
mentions, friending behavior, and demographic features. We then show how user
features can be employed as distant supervision to improve topic model fit.
Finally, we show how user features can be integrated into and improve existing
classifiers in the multitask learning framework. We treat user representations
- ground truth gender and mental health features - as auxiliary tasks to
improve mental health state prediction. We also use distributed user
representations learned in the first chapter to improve tweet-level stance
classifiers, showing that distant user information can inform classification
tasks at the granularity of a single message.

By deriving a discrete orthogonality structure on these rhodonea nodes, we will
show that the spectral interpolation problem is unisolvent. The underlying
interpolation space is generated by a parity-modified Chebyshev-Fourier basis
on the disk. This allows us to compute the spectral interpolant in an efficient
way. Properties as continuity, convergence and numerical condition of the
scheme depend on the spectral structure of the interpolation space. For
rectangular spectral index sets, we show that the interpolant is continuous at
the center, the Lebesgue constant grows logarithmically and that the scheme
converges fast if the function under consideration is smooth. Finally, we
derive a Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule using function evaluations at the
rhodonea nodes and conduct some numerical experiments to compare different

directly encodes the convolved image information, which is updated
asynchronously as each event arrives from the camera. The state can be read-off
as-often-as and whenever required for use in higher level vision algorithms for
real-time robotic systems. We demonstrate the application of our method to

operator. Surprisingly, despite these concerns, and independent of its effect
on exploration, the softmax Bellman operator when combined with Deep
Q-learning, leads to Q-functions with superior policies in practice, even
outperforming its double Q-learning counterpart. To better understand how and
why this occurs, we revisit theoretical properties of the softmax Bellman
operator, and prove that $(i)$ it converges to the standard Bellman operator
exponentially fast in the inverse temperature parameter, and $(ii)$ the
distance of its Q function from the optimal one can be bounded. These alone do
not explain its superior performance, so we also show that the softmax operator
can reduce the overestimation error, which may give some insight into why a
sub-optimal operator leads to better performance in the presence of value
function approximation. A comparison among different Bellman operators is then
presented, showing the trade-offs when selecting them.

identical Fe atoms divacantly-substituted into graphene. Using density
functional theory, we simulated the electronic and magnetic properties for a
supercell of graphene with spatial variation of the Fe atoms along either the
armchair or zig-zag directions. Overall, we find that the exchange interaction
between the two Fe atoms fluctuates from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic as
a function of the spatial distance in the armchair direction. Given the induced
magnetic moment and increased density of states at the Fermi level by the
surrounding carbon atoms, we conclude that an RKKY-like interaction may
characterize the exchange interactions between the Fe atoms. Furthermore, we
examined the same interactions for Fe atoms along the zig-zag direction in
graphene and found no evidence for an RKKY interaction as this system shows
standard superexchange between the transition-metal impurities. Therefore, we
determine that Fe-substituted graphene produces a directional-dependent spin
interaction, which may provide stability to spintronic and multifunctional
devices and applications for graphene.

learning approach can be easily implemented with stochastic gradient descent

training cost is almost negligible and it has no impact on the inference time
or memory cost. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed anchor
optimization method consistently achieves significant improvement ($\ge 1\%$
mAP absolute gain) over the baseline methods on several benchmark datasets

also verified towards different anchor initialization methods and the number of

First, we present a new adaptation to the CycleGAN model to produce stochastic

enhance the classifier performance by using a self-ensembling technique with a

Finally, we present experimental results on three datasets Office-31,

  Communications Security (CCS)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many of today's machine learning (ML) systems are built by reusing an array
of, often pre-trained, primitive models, each fulfilling distinct functionality
(e.g., feature extraction). The increasing use of primitive models
significantly simplifies and expedites the development cycles of ML systems.
Yet, because most of such models are contributed and maintained by untrusted
sources, their lack of standardization or regulation entails profound security
implications, about which little is known thus far.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that malicious primitive models pose immense
threats to the security of ML systems. We present a broad class of {\em
model-reuse} attacks wherein maliciously crafted models trigger host ML systems
to misbehave on targeted inputs in a highly predictable manner. By empirically
studying four deep learning systems (including both individual and ensemble
systems) used in skin cancer screening, speech recognition, face verification,
and autonomous steering, we show that such attacks are (i) effective - the host
systems misbehave on the targeted inputs as desired by the adversary with high
probability, (ii) evasive - the malicious models function indistinguishably
from their benign counterparts on non-targeted inputs, (iii) elastic - the
malicious models remain effective regardless of various system design choices
and tuning strategies, and (iv) easy - the adversary needs little prior
knowledge about the data used for system tuning or inference. We provide
analytical justification for the effectiveness of model-reuse attacks, which
points to the unprecedented complexity of today's primitive models. This issue
thus seems fundamental to many ML systems. We further discuss potential
countermeasures and their challenges, which lead to several promising research
directions.

the existence of a large number of model moments. In this paper, parameter
estimation based on the phase function, a normalized version of the
characteristic function, is considered. This approach requires the model
covariates to have asymmetric distributions, while the error distributions are
symmetric. Parameter estimation is then based on minimizing a distance function
between the empirical phase functions of the noisy covariates and the outcome

calculate this estimator. Both the asymptotic and finite sample properties of
the estimator are considered. The connection between the phase function
approach and method of moments is also discussed. The estimation of standard

founded statements about the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The
predominant topic in this research domain is runtime analysis, which studies
the time it takes a given EA to solve a given optimization problem. Runtime
analysis has witnessed significant advances in the last couple of years,
allowing us to compute precise runtime estimates for several EAs and several
problems. Runtime analysis is, however (and unfortunately!), often judged by
practitioners to be of little relevance for real applications of EAs. Several
reasons for this claim exist. We address two of them in this present work:
  (1) EA implementations often differ from their vanilla pseudocode
description, which, in turn, typically form the basis for runtime analysis. To
close the resulting gap between empirically observed and theoretically derived
performance estimates, we therefore suggest to take this discrepancy into
account in the mathematical analysis and to adjust, for example, the cost
assigned to the evaluation of search points that equal one of their direct
parents (provided that this is easy to verify as is the case in almost all
standard EAs).
  (2) Most runtime analysis results make statements about the expected time to
reach an optimal solution (and possibly the distribution of this optimization
time) only, thus explicitly or implicitly neglecting the importance of
understanding how the function values evolve over time. We suggest to extend
runtime statements to runtime profiles, covering the expected time needed to
reach points of intermediate fitness values.
  As a direct consequence, we obtain a result showing that the greedy (2+1) GA
of Sudholt [GECCO 2012] outperforms any unary unbiased black-box algorithm on

superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana bound states (MBS), which may have
applications in topological quantum computation. In
superconductor-TI-superconductor Josephson junctions, the supercurrent versus
the phase difference between the superconductors, referred to as the
current-phase relation (CPR), reveals important information including the
nature of the superconducting transport. Here, we study the induced
superconductivity in gate-tunable Josephson junctions (JJs) made from
topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 with superconducting Nb electrodes. We observe
highly skewed (non-sinusoidal) CPR in these junctions. The critical current, or
the magnitude of the CPR, increases with decreasing temperature down to the
lowest accessible temperature (T ~ 20 mK), revealing the existence of
low-energy modes in our junctions. The gate dependence shows that close to the
Dirac point the CPR becomes less skewed, indicating the transport is more
diffusive, most likely due to the presence of electron/hole puddles and charge
inhomogeneity. Our experiments provide strong evidence that superconductivity
is induced in the highly ballistic topological surface states (TSS) in our
gate-tunable TI- based JJs. Furthermore, the measured CPR is in good agreement
with the prediction of a model which calculates the phase dependent eigenstate
energies in our system, considering the finite width of the electrodes as well
as the TSS wave functions extending over the entire circumference of the TI.

determine the best one. For OTSS, we derive an upper bound on its misalignment

an ideal beam pattern. We also characterize the decay rate function of the
upper bound with respect to the training budget and further derive the optimal
design parameters of OTSS that maximize the decay rate. OTSS is proved to
asymptotically outperform state-of-the-art beam alignment algorithms, and is
numerically shown to achieve better performance with limited training budget

investigated. By introducing circuit asymmetry, the supratransmission
thresholds, critical excitation amplitudes to enable bandgap transmission, are
found at different levels for the different wave transmission directions and
hence creating an excitation amplitude range within which nonreciprocal wave
transmission can be facilitated. Effect of the asymmetry factor on
nonreciprocity properties is subsequently analyzed and the trade-offs between
the forward transmission amplitude and the range of excitation with

deal with 3D segmentation for medical image analysis. Existing approaches
either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D)
networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot
capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and
less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.
  In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach
named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although
the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its
boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in
the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object
boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around
each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network
to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually
adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the
boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based
segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands
out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches. EBP achieves promising accuracy in
abdominal organ segmentation. Our code has been open-sourced

coupled first-order ODE. The open question by Grava et al. asks whether a
global smooth solution of the ODE with boundary condition {\alpha}(\infty)=0
and q_2(\infty)=1 exists. By studying the linear equation that is associated
with q_2 and {\alpha}, we give a positive answer to the open question.
Moreover, we find that the solutions of the ODE with {\alpha}(\infty)=0 and
q_2(\infty)=1 are parameterized by c_1 and c_2 . Not all c_1 and c_2 give
global smooth solutions. But if (c_1, c_2) \in R_{smooth}, where R_{smooth} is
a large region containing (0,0), they do give. We prove the constructed
solution is a bounded solution of the Bloemendal-Vir\'ag equation with the
required boundary condition if and only if (c_1,c_2)=(0,0).

al. in 2000 to a log-determinant semidefinite problem (SDP) with linear
constraints and propose a spectral projected gradient method for the dual
problem. Our method is based on alternate projections on the intersection of
two convex sets, which first projects onto the box constraints and then onto a
set defined by a linear matrix inequality. By exploiting structures of the two
projections, we show the same convergence properties can be obtained for the
proposed method as Birgin's method where the exact orthogonal projection onto
the intersection of two convex sets is performed. Using the convergence
properties, we prove that the proposed algorithm attains the optimal value or
terminates in a finite number of iterations. The efficiency of the proposed
method is illustrated with the numerical results on randomly generated
synthetic/deterministic data and gene expression data, in comparison with other
methods including the inexact primal-dual path-following interior-point method,
the adaptive spectral projected gradient method, and the adaptive Nesterov's
smooth method. For the gene expression data, our results are compared with the
quadratic approximation for sparse inverse covariance estimation method. We
show that our method outperforms the other methods in obtaining a better
optimal value fast.

effect. Anti-causal models are used to drive this search, but a causal model is
required for validation. We investigate the fundamental differences between
causal and anti-causal tasks, discuss implications for topics ranging from

present a simple yet surprisingly effective way of preventing catastrophic

neural net from changing its learned behaviour by performing logit matching on
selected samples kept in episodic memory from the old tasks. Surprisingly, this
simplistic approach only requires to retrain a small amount of data in order to
outperform previous methods in knowledge retention. We demonstrate the

for high-resolution sampling of phonocardiogram (PCG), photoplethysmogram, and
electrocardiogram (ECG). PCG and ECG perform as the proximal timing reference
to obtain PTT and PAT indices, respectively. In order to derive a BP estimator
model, a calibration procedure, including a supervised physical exercise, is
conducted for each individual, which causes changes in their BP, and then, a
number of reference BPs are measured alongside the acquisition of the signals
per subject. It is suggested to use a force-sensing resistor that is placed
under the cuff of the BP reference device to mark the exact moments of
reference BP measurements, which are corresponding to the inflation of the
cuff. Additionally, a novel BP estimator nonlinear model, based on the theory
of elastic tubes, is introduced to estimate the BP using PTT/PAT values
precisely. The proposed method is evaluated on 32 subjects. Using the PTT
index, the correlation coefficients for SBP and DBP estimation are 0.89 and
0.84, respectively. Using the PAT index, the correlation coefficients for SBP

proposed method, exploiting the introduced nonlinear model with the use of PAT

either a boost or $T \bar{T}$ deformation. For the boost case, we show that,
although it trivially acts on the underlying theory, it nontrivially affects
the entanglement entropy due to the length contraction. For a three-dimensional
AdS, we show that the effect of the boost transformation can be reinterpreted
as the rescaling of the energy scale, similar to the $T \bar{T}$ deformation.
Under the boost and $T \bar{T}$ deformation, the $c$-function of the
entanglement entropy exactly shows the features expected by the Zamoldchikov's
$c$-theorem. The deformed theory is always stationary at a UV fixed point and
monotonically flows to another CFT in the IR fixed point. We also show that the

the exact same result of the $T \bar{T}$ deformed theory on a two-dimensional

  Interference Channel","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1810.13256",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many communication channels, secrecy constraints usually incur a penalty
in capacity, as well as generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In this work we
show an interesting observation that, adding a helper can totally remove the
penalty in sum GDoF, for a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel.
For the interference channel where each transmitter sends a message to an
intended receiver without secrecy constraints, the sum GDoF is a well-known ""W""
curve, characterized by Etkin-Tse-Wang in 2008. If the secrecy constraints are
imposed on this interference channel, where the message of each transmitter
must be secure from the unintended receiver (eavesdropper), then a GDoF penalty
is incurred and the secure sum GDoF is reduced to a modified ""W"" curve, derived
by Chen recently. In this work we show that, by adding a helper into this
interference channel with secrecy constraints, the secure sum GDoF turns out to
be a ""W"" curve, which is the same as the sum GDoF of the setting without
secrecy constraints. The proposed scheme is based on the cooperative jamming
and a careful signal design such that the jamming signal of the helper is
aligned at a specific direction and power level with the information signals of
the transmitters, which allows to totally remove the penalty in GDoF due to the
secrecy constraints. Furthermore, the estimation approaches of noise removal
and signal separation due to the rational independence are used in the secure
rate analysis.

on attacking image classification models. Nevertheless, little attention has
been paid to attacking image retrieval systems. In this paper, we make the
first attempt in attacking image retrieval systems. Concretely, image retrieval
attack is to make the retrieval system return irrelevant images to the query at
the top ranking list. It plays an important role to corrupt the neighbourhood
relationships among features in image retrieval attack. To this end, we propose
a novel method to generate retrieval-against UAP to break the neighbourhood
relationships of image features via degrading the corresponding ranking metric.
To expand the attack method to scenarios with varying input sizes or
untouchable network parameters, a multi-scale random resizing scheme and a
ranking distillation strategy are proposed. We evaluate the proposed method on
four widely-used image retrieval datasets, and report a significant performance
drop in terms of different metrics, such as mAP and mP@10. Finally, we test our
attack methods on the real-world visual search engine, i.e., Google Images,

activity characteristics and further separate sleep and wake states. We used
Actiwatch and polysomnography (PSG) data from 43 individuals in the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis to evaluate the performance of our
method. Epoch-by-epoch comparisons were made between our HMM algorithm and that
embedded in the Actiwatch software (AS). The percent agreement between HMM and
PSG was 85.7%, and that between AS and PSG was 84.7%. Positive predictive
values for sleep epochs were 85.6% and 84.6% for HMM and AS, respectively, and
95.5% and 85.6% for wake epochs. Both methods have similar performance and tend
to overestimate sleep and underestimate wake compared to PSG. Our HMM approach
is able to quantify the variability in activity counts that allow us to
differentiate relatively active and sedentary individuals: individuals with
higher estimated variabilities tend to show more frequent sedentary behaviors.
In conclusion, our unsupervised data-driven HMM algorithm achieves slightly
better performance compared to the commonly used algorithm in the Actiwatch
software. HMM can help expand the application of actigraphy in large-scale
studies and in cases where intrusive PSG is hard to acquire or unavailable. In
addition, the estimated HMM parameters can characterize individual activity
patterns that can be utilized for further analysis.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image processing has been shown to have
significant impacts on medical image segmentation. Network training of
segmentation CNNs typically requires images and paired annotation data
representing pixel-wise tissue labels referred to as masks. However, the
supervised training of highly efficient CNNs with deeper structure and more
network parameters requires a large number of training images and paired tissue
masks. Thus, there is great need to develop a generalized CNN-based
segmentation method which would be applicable for a wide variety of MR image
datasets with different tissue contrasts. The purpose of this study was to
develop and evaluate a generalized CNN-based method for fully-automated
segmentation of different MR image datasets using a single set of annotated

was evaluated for segmenting bone and cartilage on two clinical knee MR image

about the driving conditions they experience on the traveled path in real time.
In this paper we analyse the simple but fundamental model of a platform
choosing between two paths: one with known deterministic travel cost and the
other that alternates over time between a low and a high random cost states,
where the low and the high cost states are only partially observable and
perform respectively better and worse on average than the fixed cost path. The
more users are routed over the stochastic path, the better the platform can
infer its actual state and use it efficiently.
  At the Nash equilibrium, if asked to take the riskier path, in many cases
selfish users will myopically disregard the optimal path suggestions of the
platform, leading to a suboptimal system without enough exploration on the
stochastic path. We prove the interesting result that if the past collected
information is hidden from users, the system becomes incentive compatible and
even `sophisticated' users (in the sense that they have full capability to
reverse-engineer the platform's recommendation and derive the path state
distribution conditional on the recommendation) prefer to follow the platform's
recommendations. In a more practical setting where the platform implements a
model-free Q-learning algorithm to minimise the social travel cost, our
analysis suggests that increasing the accuracy of the learning algorithm
increases the range of system parameters for which sophisticated users follow !
the recommendations of the platform, becoming in the limit fully incentive
compatible. Finally, we extend the two-path model to include more stochastic
paths, and show that incentive compatibility holds under our information

information out of a scenario that is monitored and where communication is not
allowed. Specifically, the UAV as a transmitter intends to transmit information
to a legitimate receiver (Bob) covertly in order to avoid being detected by a
warden (Willie) with location uncertainties at Bob and/or Willie. In order to
enhance the considered covert communication performance, we prefer to jointly
optimize the UAV's trajectory and transmit power in terms of maximizing the
average covert transmission rate from the UAV to Bob subject to transmission
outage constraint and covertness constraint. The formulated optimization
problem is difficult to tackle directly due to the intractable constraints. As
such, we first employ conservative approximation to transform a constraint into
a deterministic form and then apply the first-order restrictive approximation
to transform the optimization problem into a convex form. By applying the
successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, an efficient iterative
algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. Our examination shows
that the developed joint trajectory and transmit power optimization scheme
achieves significantly better covert communication performance as compared to a
benchmark scheme.

From a practical point of view, the theoretical analysis of generalization

precisely, under minimal learnability assumptions, we derive a new risk bound

a Rademacher complexity as a capacity measure. This capacity measure is then
linked to the metric entropy through the chaining method. In this context, our
improvement is based on the introduction of a new combinatorial metric entropy

learning survival analysis techniques. Firstly, we applied fifty one potential
readmission risk variables to Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) survival regression
univariate analysis. Fourteen of them turned out to be significant (with p
value < 0.05), contributing to readmissions. Subsequently, we applied these 14
predictors to multivariate CPH model and Deep Learning Neural Network (NN)
representation of the CPH model, DeepSurv. We validated this new ensembled
model with 453 isolated adult CABG cases. Nine of the fourteen perioperative
risk variables were identified as the most significant with Hazard Ratios (HR)
of greater than 1.0. The concordance index metrics for CPH, DeepSurv, and
ensembled models were then evaluated with training and validation datasets. Our
ensembled model yielded promising results in terms of c-statistics, as we
raised the the number of iterations and data set sizes. 30 day all-cause
readmissions among isolated CABG patients can be predicted more effectively
with perioperative pre-discharge data, using machine learning survival analysis

the real electric field that is perpendicular to neuron membrane to initiate an
action potential. Thus, to reveal the real electrode-tissue interactions, we
developed a circuit to model transmembrane voltage waveforms. Here, we show a
distributed-parameter circuit model to systematically study how
electrode-tissue interaction is affected by electrode position, input current
waveform, and biological structures in the neuromuscular system. Our model
explains and predicts various phenomena in neuromuscular stimulation, guides
new stimulation electrode and method design, and more importantly, facilitates
a fundamental understanding of the physical process during electrode-tissue
interaction. In our model, myelin is assumed to be inductive. The voltage
waveform resonance caused by this inductive myelin accounts for the much lower
stimulation threshold to activate motoneurons than muscle fibers, which is
observed with in vivo measurements. These findings confirmed the feasibility of
studying electrode-tissue interaction using a proper distributed-parameter

Such problem domains are challenging owing to the demand uncertainty,
combinatorial action spaces (due to allocation) and constraints on allocation

  Existing systems typically employ myopic and greedy optimization approaches
to optimize allocation of supply resources to locations. Such approaches
typically are unable to handle surges or variances in demand patterns well.
Recent research has demonstrated the ability of Deep RL methods in adapting

efficiency of a bus system, but also prevents transit authorities from keeping

Sustained bunching is a repercussion of the process of phase synchronisation
whereby the phases of the oscillators are locked to each other. This emerges
when demand exceeds a critical threshold. Buses also bunch at low demand,
albeit temporarily, due to frequency detuning arising from different human
drivers' distinct natural speeds. We calculate the critical transition when
\emph{complete phase locking} (full synchronisation) occurs for the bus system,
and posit the critical transition to \emph{completely no phase locking} (zero
synchronisation). The intermediate regime is the phase where clusters of
partially phase locked buses exist. Intriguingly, these theoretical results are
in close correspondence to real buses in a university's shuttle bus system.

density of dark energy in the form of a series of inverse powers of the

to a signature-based operation. A UEBA process usually involves two phases,
learning and inference. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) available still
suffer from bias, including over-simplification of problems, underexploitation
of the AI potential, insufficient consideration of the temporality of events,
and perfectible management of the memory cycle of behaviours. In addition,
while an alert generated by a signature-based IDS can refer to the signature on

unsupervised approach is to enrich this process by adding a third phase to
correlate events (incongruities, weak signals) that are presumed to be linked

completing the Schwinger-Dyson pyramid for quartic melonic (`pillow'-vertices)

functional connectivity of a class of GABAergic sensory neurons contacting the
CSF in the vertebrate spinal cord and referred to as CSF-cNs. The remote
activation of CSF-cNs was shown to trigger delayed slow locomotion in the
zebrafish larva, suggesting that these cells modulate components of locomotor
central pattern generators (CPGs). Combining anatomy, electrophysiology, and
optogenetics in vivo, we show that CSF-cNs form active GABAergic synapses onto
V0-v glutamatergic interneurons, an essential component of locomotor CPGs. We
confirmed that activating CSF-cNs at rest induced delayed slow locomotion in
the fictive preparation. In contrast, the activation of CSF-cNs promptly
inhibited ongoing slow locomotion. Moreover, selective activation of rostral
CSF-cNs during ongoing activity disrupted rostrocaudal propagation of
descending excitation along the spinal cord, indicating that CSF-cNs primarily
act at the premotor level. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a spinal
GABAergic sensory neuron can tune the excitability of locomotor CPGs in a
state-dependent manner by projecting onto essential components of the
excitatory premotor pool.

absorption at telecommunication wavelengths. Heating due to strongly confined
light fields is therefore greatly reduced. Here, we investigate the benefits of
these properties for cavity optomechanics. Utilizing a recently developed
fabrication scheme based on direct wafer bonding, we realize integrated
one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities made of gallium phosphide with
optical quality factors as high as $1.1\times10^5$. We optimize their design to
couple the optical eigenmode at $\approx 200$ THz via radiation pressure to a
co-localized mechanical mode with a frequency of 3 GHz, yielding
sideband-resolved devices. The high vacuum optomechanical coupling rate
($g_0=2\pi\times 400$ kHz) permits amplification of the mechanical mode into
the so-called mechanical lasing regime with input power as low as $\approx 20$
{\mu}W. The observation of mechanical lasing implies a multiphoton
cooperativity of $C>1$, an important threshold for the realization of quantum

optomechanically induced transparency can be detected at room temperature in
addition to the normally observed optomechanically induced absorption.

tiny numbers. The well-defined principle for protecting the tiny number to be
large from quantum correction is supersymmetry. However, such a nice framework
is challenged by the non-observation of superpartners at LHC. Instead, we
propose a new principle to realize a natural framework to explain the smallness
of feebly interaction dark matter coupling and neutrino mass. The scalar sector
as well as gauge sector must be extended to include $N$ copies as a price. It
is found in this paper that the yukawa coupling $y$ as well as quartic coupling
$\lambda$ scales with inverse power of $N$ to maintain perturbativity. In terms
of the scaling behavior of couplings, the freeze-in dark matter becomes
compatible with neutrino mass requirement. The biggest observation is that $y$
has to be evaluated by $1/N^{3/2}$ in type-I seesaw mechanism in order to
obtain a large $N$ suppressed neutrino mass. The intrinsic hierarchy between
$1/\sqrt{N}$ and $1/N^{3/2}$ for yukawa coupling $y$ can be improved if we
focus on the loop generated neutrino mass which can be relaxed to be $1/N$. The
underlying reason for not use $1/\sqrt{N}$ is that freeze-in dark matter
provides a lower bound for the scaling. Therefore the only choice of scaling
for yukawa coupling is left to be $1/N$. Based on this simple scaling, we
realiza an unified framework for explaining FIMP and neutrino mass.

even the most basic mechanism of tidal triggering at the ridges has been
elusive. The triggering occurs at low tides, but as the earthquakes are of the
normal faulting type, low tides should inhibit rather than encourage faulting.
Here, treating the most well documented case, Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca
ridge, we show that the axial magma chamber inflates or deflates in response to
tidal stresses and produces Coulomb stresses on normal faults opposite in sign
to those produced by the tidal stresses. If the bulk modulus of the magma
chamber is below a critical value, the magma chamber Coulomb stresses will
exceed the tidal ones and the phase of tidal triggering will be inverted. The
stress dependence of seismicity rate agrees with triggering theory with
unprecedented faithfulness, showing that there is no triggering threshold.

time. With the increasing availability of multi-temporal remote sensing images,
numerous change detection algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods,
image transformation methods with feature extraction and mapping could
effectively highlight the changed information and thus has better change
detection performance. However, changes of multi-temporal images are usually
complex, existing methods are not effective enough. In recent years, deep
network has shown its brilliant performance in many fields including feature
extraction and projection. Therefore, in this paper, based on deep network and
slow feature analysis (SFA) theory, we proposed a new change detection
algorithm for multi-temporal remotes sensing images called Deep Slow Feature
Analysis (DSFA). In DSFA model, two symmetric deep networks are utilized for
projecting the input data of bi-temporal imagery. Then, the SFA module is
deployed to suppress the unchanged components and highlight the changed
components of the transformed features. The CVA pre-detection is employed to
find unchanged pixels with high confidence as training samples. Finally, the
change intensity is calculated with chi-square distance and the changes are
determined by threshold algorithms. The experiments are performed on two
real-world datasets and a public hyperspectral dataset. The visual comparison
and quantitative evaluation have both shown that DSFA could outperform the
other state-of-the-art algorithms, including other SFA-based and deep learning
methods.

into simpler, frequently single-physics, subproblems. A comprehensive solution
strategy may commonly be attempted, then, by means of combining strategies
devised for the constituent subproblems. When decomposing the monolithic
problem, however, it may be that requiring a particular scaling for one
subproblem enforces an undesired scaling on another. In this manuscript we
consider the H(div)-based mixed formulation of the Darcy problem as a
single-physics subproblem; the hydraulic conductivity, K, is considered
intrinsic and not subject to any rescaling.
  Preconditioners for such porous media flow problems in mixed form are
frequently based on H(div) preconditioners rather than the pressure Schur
complement. We show that when the hydraulic conductivity, K, is small the
pressure Schur complement can also be utilised for H(div)-based
preconditioners. The proposed approach employs an operator preconditioning
framework to establish a robust, K- and h-uniform block preconditioner. The
mapping properties of the continuous operator are a key component in applying
the theoretical framework point of view. As such, a main challenge addressed
here is establishing a K-uniform inf-sup condition with respect to
appropriately weighted Hilbert intersection- and sum-spaces.

  to Reduce Inter-Core Crosstalk and Capacity Wastage","15 pages,14 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inter-core crosstalk is one of the most serious impairments for signal
transmission in a multi-core fiber (MCF) optical network. On the other hand,
because of wide deployment of data centers (DCs), we are seeing an increasing
bidirectional traffic demand asymmetry, which leads to significant capacity
wastage in designing and operating an optical transport network. To alleviate
these effects, for an MCF optical network, we propose to assign fiber cores in
an MCF in an asymmetric and counter-propagating manner. This can not only
significantly reduce inter-core crosstalk between counter-propagating fiber
cores but also flexibly assign different numbers of fiber cores in the opposite
directions of a fiber link, thereby overcoming network capacity wastage due to
the bidirectional traffic demand asymmetry. To evaluate the benefits of the
proposed strategy, we consider the routing, spectrum, and core assignment
(RSCA) problem for the MCF optical network. An integer linear programming (ILP)
model and an auxiliary graph (AG) based heuristic algorithm are developed to
optimize network spectrum resource utilization. Simulation studies show the
effectiveness of the proposed core counter-propagation strategy, which can
significantly outperform its counterpart, i.e., the co-propagation scheme, in
terms of the total number of MCFs used and average inter-core crosstalk. In
addition, the proposed RSCA heuristic algorithm is efficient to perform close
to the ILP model, which can minimize the number of MCFs used and crosstalk
between neighboring cores.

The ambient temperature increases with distance from the jet origin maintaining
constant pressure. Jets with low magnetization show an enhanced collimation at
small distances with respect to hydrodynamic (HD) cases studied in a previous
paper. These jets eventually evolve in a way similar to the HD cases. Jets with
higher magnetization are affected by strong nonaxisymmetric modes that lead to
the sudden jet energy release. From there on, distorted plumes of jet material
move at subsonic velocities. This transition is associated with the formation
of structures reminiscent of the `warm spots' observed in wide-angle-tail (WAT)

type star and a short period hot Jupiter exoplanet. This is the first such
simulation in which the stellar surface evolution is studied in detail. In our
simulations, a planetary outflow, based on models of FUV evaporation of the
exoplanets upper atmosphere, results in the build-up of circumstellar and
circumplanetary material which accretes onto the stellar surface in a form of
coronal rain, in which the rain is HJ wind material falling onto the stellar
surface. We have conducted a suite of mixed geometry high resolution
simulations which characterise the behaviour of interacting stellar and
planetary wind material for a representative HJ hosting system. Our results
show that magnetic topology plays a central role in forming accretion streams
between the star and HJ and that the nature of the accretion is variable both
in location and in rate, with the final accretion point occurring at
$\phi~=~227^{\circ}$ ahead of the sub-planetary point and $\theta~=~53^{\circ}$
below the orbital plain. The size of the accretion spot itself has been found
to vary with a period of $67 \ \mathrm{ks}$. Within the accretion spot, there
is a small decrease in temperature accompanied by an increase in density
compared with ambient surface conditions. We also demonstrate that magnetic
fields cannot be ignored as accretion is highly dependent upon the magnetic
topology of both the HJ and the host. We characterise this behaviour as Star
Planet Wind Interaction (SPWI)

density limit of 50, 80, 120 and 290 mJy respectively, correcting for
ionospheric smearing, incompleteness and source blending. These counts are more
accurate than other counts in the literature at similar frequencies as a result
of the large area of sky covered and this survey's sensitivity to extended
emission missed by other surveys. At S_154MHz > 0.5 Jy, there is no evidence of
flattening in the average spectral index (alpha approx. -0.8 where S
proportional to nu^alpha) towards the lower frequencies. We demonstrate that
the SKA Design Study (SKADS) model by Wilman et al. (2008) significantly
underpredicts the observed 154 MHz GLEAM counts, particularly at the bright
end. Using deeper LOFAR counts and the SKADS model, we find that sidelobe
confusion dominates the thermal noise and classical confusion at nu >~ 100 MHz
due to both the limited CLEANing depth and undeconvolved sources outside the
field-of-view. We show that we can approach the theoretical noise limit using a
more efficient and automated CLEAN algorithm.

the use of cameras. However, the poor scalability of camera systems renders
them impractical in pursuit of the goal of wider adoption of HAR in mobile
computing contexts. Consequently, researchers instead rely on wearable sensors
and in particular inertial sensors. A particularly prevalent wearable is the
smart watch which due to its integrated inertial and optical sensing
capabilities holds great potential for realising better HAR in a non-obtrusive
way. This paper seeks to simplify the wearable approach to HAR through
determining if the wrist-mounted optical sensor alone typically found in a
smartwatch or similar device can be used as a useful source of data for
activity recognition. The approach has the potential to eliminate the need for
the inertial sensing element which would in turn reduce the cost of and
complexity of smartwatches and fitness trackers. This could potentially
commoditise the hardware requirements for HAR while retaining the functionality
of both heart rate monitoring and activity capture all from a single optical
sensor. Our approach relies on the adoption of machine vision for activity
recognition based on suitably scaled plots of the optical signals. We take this
approach so as to produce classifications that are easily explainable and
interpretable by non-technical users. More specifically, images of
photoplethysmography signal time series are used to retrain the penultimate

computational accelerator -- FPGA, GPU, etc, is not starved for data. Feeding
training data fast enough to effectively keep the accelerator utilization high
is difficult when utilizing dedicated hardware like GPUs. As accelerators are
getting faster, the storage media \& data buses feeding the data have not kept
pace and the ever increasing size of training data further compounds the
problem. We describe the design and implementation of a distributed caching
system called Hoard that stripes the data across fast local disks of multiple
GPU nodes using a distributed file system that efficiently feeds the data to
ensure minimal degradation in GPU utilization due to I/O starvation. Hoard can
cache the data from a central storage system before the start of the job or
during the initial execution of the job and feeds the cached data for
subsequent epochs of the same job and for different invocations of the jobs
that share the same data requirements, e.g. hyper-parameter tuning. Hoard
exposes a POSIX file system interface so the existing deep learning frameworks
can take advantage of the cache without any modifications. We show that Hoard,
using two NVMe disks per node and a distributed file system for caching,
achieves a 2.1x speed-up over a 10Gb/s NFS central storage system on a 16 GPU
(4 nodes, 4 GPUs per node) cluster for a challenging AlexNet ImageNet image
classification benchmark with 150GB of input dataset. As a result of the
caching, Hoard eliminates the I/O bottlenecks introduced by the shared storage
and increases the utilization of the system by 2x compared to using the shared
storage without the cache.

from a product state using a trivial circuit) nor topologically ordered. In
addition, we show that the whole setting can be understood in terms of Grover

classification performance, we also integrate a transfer learning technique
into the semi-supervised learning pipeline . Our experimental findings show
that (1) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while being independent of any

effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning approaches, (2)
leveraging unlabeled data in training a CNN-based classifier reduces the
dependency on labeled data by more than 50% to reach the same performance of a

accounting for the photometry quality, assessed from extensive artificial stars

from the original ESIM model in the following four aspects. First, a new word

address the challenge of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Second, an attentive
hierarchical recurrent encoder (AHRE) is designed which is capable to encode
sentences hierarchically and generate more descriptive representations by

pooling and last-state pooling is used instead of the simple combination of max
pooling and average pooling in the original ESIM. Last, a modification layer is
added before the softmax layer to emphasize the importance of the last
utterance in the context for response selection. In the released evaluation
results of DSTC7, our proposed method ranked second on the Ubuntu dataset and
third on the Advising dataset in subtask 1 of Track 1.

duration in a finite state-space one-dimensional gambler's ruin problem with
arbitrary winning $p(n)$ and losing $q(n)$ probabilities (i.e., they depend on
the current fortune). The formulas are stated in terms of the parameters of the
system. Beyer and Waterman [Mathematics Magazine, 50(1), 1977] showed that for
the classical gambler's ruin problem the distribution of a conditional
absorption time is symmetric in $p$ and $q$. Our formulas imply that for
non-constant winning/losing probabilities the expectation of a conditional game
duration is symmetric in these probabilities (i.e., it is the same if we
exchange $p(n)$ with $q(n)$) as long as a ratio $q(n)/p(n)$ is constant. Most
of the formulas are applied to a non-symmetric random walk on a circle/polygon.
Moreover, for a symmetric random walk on a circle we construct an optimal
strong stationary dual chain -- which turns out to be an absorbing,
non-symmetric, birth and death chain. We apply our results and provide a
formula for its expected absorption time, which is a fastest strong stationary
time for the aforementioned symmetric random walk on a circle. This way we
improve upon a result of Diaconis and Fill [The Annals of Probability, 18(4),

constructed. Expectations of the fastest strong stationary time and the one
constructed by Diaconis and Fill differ by 3/4, independently of a circle's

research efforts devote to defining the tensor rank. Among them, the recent
popular tensor tubal rank, defined based on the tensor singular value
decomposition (t-SVD), obtains promising results. However, the framework of the
t-SVD and the tensor tubal rank are applicable only to three-way tensors and
lack of flexibility to handle different correlations along different modes. To
tackle these two issues, we define a new tensor unfolding operator, named
mode-$k_1k_2$ tensor unfolding, as the process of lexicographically stacking
the mode-$k_1k_2$ slices of an $N$-way tensor into a three-way tensor, which is
a three-way extension of the well-known mode-$k$ tensor matricization. Based on
it, we define a novel tensor rank, the tensor $N$-tubal rank, as a vector whose
elements contain the tubal rank of all mode-$k_1k_2$ unfolding tensors, to
depict the correlations along different modes. To efficiently minimize the
proposed $N$-tubal rank, we establish its convex relaxation: the weighted sum
of tensor nuclear norm (WSTNN). Then, we apply WSTNN to low-rank tensor
completion (LRTC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). The
corresponding WSTNN-based LRTC and TRPCA models are proposed, and two efficient
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithms are
developed to solve the proposed models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
the proposed models significantly outperform the compared ones.

describe the water quality change and to determine the water carrying capacity.
This paper is devoted to identify the degradation coefficient in an anomalous
diffusion process by using the average flux data at the accessible part of
boundary. The main challenges in inverse degradation coefficient problems
(IDCP) is the average flux measurement data only provide very limited
information and cause the severe ill-posedness of IDCP. Firstly, we prove the
average flux measurement data can uniquely determine the degradation
coefficient. The existence and uniqueness of weak solution for the direct
problem are established, and the Lipschitz continuity of the corresponding
forward operator is also obtained. Secondly, to overcome the ill-posedness, we
combine the variational regularization method with Laplace approximations (LA)
to solve the IDCP. This hybrid method is essentially the combination of
deterministic regularization method and stochastic method. Thus, it is able to
calculate the minimizer (MAP point) more rapidly and accurately, but also
enables captures the statistics information and quantifying the uncertainty of
the solution. Furthermore, the existence, stability and convergence of the
minimizer of the variational problem are proved. The convergence rate estimate
between the LA posterior distribution and the actual posterior distribution in
the sense of Hellinger distance is given, and the skewness are introduced for
characterizing the symmetry or slope of LA solution, especially the
relationship with the symmetry of the measurement data. Finally, the
one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical examples are presented to confirm
the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.

  Information Theory",,,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collective behaviour is known to be the result of diverse dynamics and is
sometimes likened to a living system. Although many studies have revealed the
dynamics of various collective behaviours, their main focus was on the
information process inside the collective, not on the whole system itself. For
example, the qualitative difference between two elements and three elements as
a system has rarely been investigated. Tononi et al. have proposed Integrated
Information Theory (IIT) to measure the degree of consciousness $\Phi$. IIT
postulates that the amount of information loss caused by certain partitions is
equivalent to the degree of information integration in the system. This measure
is not only useful for estimating the degree of consciousness but can also be
applied to more general network systems. Here we applied IIT (in particular,
IIT 3.0 using PyPhi) to analyse real fish schools ({\it Plecoglossus
altivelis}). Our hypothesis in this study is a very simple one: a living system
evolves to raise its $\Phi$ value. If we accept this hypothesis, IIT reveals
the existence of continuous and discontinuous properties as group size varies.
For example, leadership in the fish school emerged for a school size of four or
above; but not below three. Furthermore, this transition was not observed by
measuring mutual information or in a simple Boids model. This result suggests
that integrated information $\Phi$ can reveal some inherent properties which
cannot be observed using other measures. We also discuss how the fish
recognition of the figure-ground relation, that is, what determines the
relevant ON and OFF states, may reveal various optimal paths for obtaining the
functional evolution of collective behaviour.

electron subsystem as a source of spin relaxation. The obtained magnon-drag
electron current is proportional to the entropy of magnons and to $\alpha -

damping constant and $\beta$ is the dissipative spin-transfer torque parameter.
This result almost coincides with the previous phenomenological result based on

important technical issues appear (or are aggravated with respect to those of

image patches to erase scene text, our method, namely ensconce network
(EnsNet), can operate end-to-end on a single image without any prior knowledge.
The overall structure is an end-to-end trainable FCN-ResNet-18 network with a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). The feature of the former is
first enhanced by a novel lateral connection structure and then refined by four
carefully designed losses: multiscale regression loss and content loss, which
capture the global discrepancy of different level features; texture loss and
total variation loss, which primarily target filling the text region and
preserving the reality of the background. The latter is a novel local-sensitive
GAN, which attentively assesses the local consistency of the text erased
regions. Both qualitative and quantitative sensitivity experiments on synthetic
images and the ICDAR 2013 dataset demonstrate that each component of the EnsNet
is essential to achieve a good performance. Moreover, our EnsNet can
significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of all

lack flexibility, and are limited by the speed of digital switches. In this
paper, we alternatively develop a top-down traffic grooming (TG) approach to
the design and provisioning of mission-critical optical wireless DCNs. While
switches are modeled as hybrid optoelectronic cross-connects, links are modeled
as wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capable free-space optic (FSO)
channels. Using the standard TG terminology, we formulate the optimal
mixed-integer TG problem considering the virtual topology, flow conversation,
connection topology, non-bifurcation, and capacity constraints. Thereafter, we
develop a fast yet efficient sub-optimal solution which grooms mice flows (MFs)
and mission-critical flows (CFs) and forward on predetermined rack-to-rack
(R2R) lightpaths. On the other hand, elephant flows (EFs) are forwarded over
dedicated server-to-server (S2S) express lightpaths whose routes and capacity
are dynamically determined based on the availability of wavelength and
capacity. To prioritize the CFs, we consider low and high priority queues and
analyze the delay characteristics such as waiting times, maximum hop counts,
and blocking probability. As a result of grooming the sub-wavelength traffic
and adjusting the wavelength capacities, numerical results show that the
proposed solutions can achieve significant performance enhancement by utilizing
the bandwidth more efficiently, completing the flows faster than delay
sensitivity requirements, and avoiding the traffic congestion by treating EFs
and MFs separately.

Without any annotations on real images, our algorithm generalizes well and
produces satisfying results on 3D pose estimation, which is evaluated on two

Unlike other widely used codes, it runs on predefined lists of positions,
allowing for repeated measurements on the same list of objects on different

exploit the CANDELS GOODS-South data to compare the A-PHOT measurements with
those from the survey legacy catalogs, finding good agreement overall. A-PHOT
proves to a useful and versatile tool for quickly extracting robust and

Moreover, the PbI$_3$ columns avoid the Peierls distortion and assume a

lower social welfare for a non-negligible amount of time. To counter this, this
paper introduces a framework for including both AC and HVDC losses in a zonal

of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide a plethora of services ranging
from delivery of goods to surveillance. In particular, UAVs in a swarm can
utilize wireless communications to collect information, like velocity and
heading angle, from surrounding UAVs for coordinating their operations and
maintaining target speed and intra-UAV distance. However, due to the
uncertainty of the wireless channel, wireless communications among UAVs will
experience a transmission delay which can impair the swarm's ability to
stabilize system operation. In this paper, the problem of joint communication
and control is studied for a swarm of three cellular-connected UAVs positioned
in a triangle formation. In particular, a novel approach is proposed for
optimizing the swarm's operation while jointly considering the delay of the
wireless network and the stability of the control system. Based on this
approach, the maximum allowable delay required to prevent the instability of
the swarm is determined. Moreover, by using stochastic geometry, the
reliability of the wireless network is derived as the probability of meeting
the stability requirement of the control system. The simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint strategy, and help obtain
insightful design guidelines on how to form a stable swarm of UAVs.

show that only two-quasiparticle scattering processes contribute to the

in the framework of the (3+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) in
the large-$N_c$ limit ($N_c$ is the number of quark colors). Its phase
structure is considered in terms of baryon -- $\mu_B$, isospin -- $\mu_I$ and
chiral isospin -- $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials. It is shown in the paper that
(i) in the chiral limit there is a duality between chiral symmetry breaking
(CSB) and charged pion condensation (PC) phenomena. (ii) At the physical point,
i.e. at nonzero bare quark mass $m_0$, and temperature this duality relation is
only approximate, although rather accurate. (iii) We have shown that the chiral
isospin chemical potential $\mu_{I5}$ in dense quark matter generates charged
pion condensation both at zero and nonzero $m_0$, and at $\mu_{I5}\ne 0$ this
phase might be observed up to temperatures as high as 100 MeV. (iv)
Pseudo-critical temperature of the chiral crossover transition rises in the NJL
model with increasing $\mu_{I5}$. (v) It has been found an agreement between
particular sections of the phase diagram in the framework of NJL model and
corresponding ones in lattice QCD simulations. Two different plots from
different lattice simulations that are completely independent and are not
connected at the first sight are in reality dual to each other, it means that
lattice QCD simulations support the hypothesis that in real quark matter there
exists the (approximate) duality between CSB and charged PC. Moreover, we can
reverse the logic and we can predict the increase of pseudo-critical
temperature with chiral chemical potential, the much debated effect recently,
just by the duality notion, hence bolster confidence in this result (lattice
QCD showed this feature for unphysically large pion mass) and put it on the
considerably more solid ground.

assigning different decision variables to their respective time horizons and
therefore ensures their manageability. However, the restrictive structure of
this top-down approach implying that upper level decisions are the constraints
for lower level decisions also has its shortcomings. One problem that occurs is
that deterministic mixed integer decision problems are often used for long-term
planning, but the real production system faces a set of stochastic influences.
Therefore, a planned utilisation factor has to be included into this
deterministic aggregate planning problem. In practice, this decision is often
based on past data and not consciously taken. In this paper, the effect of
long-term forecast error on the optimal planned utilisation factor is evaluated
for a production system facing stochastic demand and the benefit of exploiting
this decision's potential is discussed. Overall costs including capacity,
backorder and inventory costs, are determined with simulation for different
multi-stage and multi-item production system structures. The results show that
the planned utilisation factor used in the aggregate planning problem has a
high influence on optimal costs. Additionally, the negative effect of forecast
errors is evaluated and discussed in detail for different production system

that is constant for a range of applied voltages and applied macroscopic fields
$F_\text{M}$. A constant FEF of this kind can be evaluated for classical CNT
emitter models by finite-element and other methods, but (apparently contrary to
experiment) several past quantum-mechanical (QM) CNT calculations find
FEF-values that vary with $F_\text{M}$. A common feature of most such
calculations is that they focus only on deriving the CNT real-charge
distributions. Here we report on calculations that use density functional
theory (DFT) to derive real-charge distributions, and then use these to
generate the related induced-charge distributions and related fields and FEFs.
We have analysed three carbon nanostructures involving CNT-like nanoprotrusions
of various lengths, and have also simulated geometrically equivalent classical
emitter models, using finite-element methods. We find that when the
DFT-generated local induced FEFs (LIFEFs) are used, the resulting values are
effectively independent of macroscopic field, and behave in the same
qualitative manner as the classical FEF-values. Further, there is fair to good
quantitative agreement between a characteristic FEF determined classically and
the equivalent characteristic LIFEF generated via DFT approaches. Although many
issues of detail remain to be explored, this appears to be a significant step
forwards in linking classical and QM theories of CNT electrostatics. It also
shows clearly that, for ideal CNTs, the known experimental constancy of the FEF
value for a range of macroscopic fields can also be found in appropriately
developed QM theory.

overlook the reference electrode impact. The subsequent interpretation of brain
connectivity is thus often biased by the choice a non-neutral reference. This
study aims at systematically investigating these effects. As EEG reference, we
examined: the vertex electrode (Cz), the digitally linked mastoids (DLM), the
average reference (AVE), and the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique
(REST). As a connectivity metric, we used the imaginary part of coherency. We
tested simulated and real data (eyes open resting state), by evaluating the
influence of electrode density, effect of head model accuracy in the REST
transformation, and impact on the characterization of the topology of
functional networks from graph analysis. Simulations demonstrated that REST
significantly reduced the distortion of connectivity patterns when compared to
AVE, Cz and DLM references. Moreover, the availability of high-density EEG
systems and an accurate knowledge of the head model are crucial elements to
improve REST performance. For real data, a systematic change of the spatial
pattern of functional connectivity depending on the chosen reference was also
observed. The distortion of connectivity patterns was larger for the Cz
reference, and progressively decreases when using the DLM, the AVE, the REST.
Strikingly, we also showed that network attributes derived from graph analysis,
i.e., node degree and local efficiency, are significantly influenced by the EEG
reference choice. Overall, this study highlights that significant differences
arise in scalp EEG functional connectivity and graph network properties, in
dependence of the chosen reference. We hope our study will convey the message
that caution should be taken when interpreting and comparing results obtained
from different laboratories when using different reference schemes.

quantifying the stellar feedback processes that take place at different scales.
We present ~85 arcmin^2 velocity-resolved maps of several submm molecular lines
toward the closest high-mass star-forming region, OMC-1. The observed
rotational lines include probes of warm and dense molecular gas that are
difficult to detect from ground-based telescopes: CH+ (1-0), CO (10-9), HCO+
(6-5), and HCN (6-5). These lines trace an extended but thin layer of molecular
gas at high thermal pressure, P_th ~ 1e7-1e9 K/cm3, associated with the
FUV-irradiated surface of OMC-1. The intense FUV field, emerging from massive
stars in the Trapezium cluster, heats, compresses and photoevaporates the cloud
edge. It also triggers the formation of reactive molecules such as CH+. The CH+
(1-0) emission spatially correlates with the flux of FUV photons impinging the
cloud: G_0 from 1e3 to 1e5. This correlation is supported by isobaric PDR
models in the parameter space P_th/G_0 ~ [5e3-8e4] K/cm3 where many PDRs seem
to lie. The CH+ (1-0) emission correlates with the extended emission from
vibrationally excited H2, and with that of [CII]158um and CO 10-9, all emerging
from FUV-irradiated gas. These correlations link the presence of CH+ to the
availability of C+ ions and of FUV-pumped H2(v>0) molecules. The parsec-scale
CH+ emission and narrow-line (dv ~ 3 km/s) mid-J CO emission arises from
extended PDRs and not from fast shocks. PDR line tracers are the smoking gun of
the stellar feedback from young massive stars. The PDR component in OMC-1
represents 5 to 10% of the total gas mass, however, it dominates the emitted
line luminosity. These results provide insights into the source of submm CH+
and mid-J CO emission from distant star-forming galaxies.

illumination of the target stimulus: white letters, white blocks, coloured
letters, and coloured blocks. Results: The block-shaped conditions offered an
improvement versus the letter-shaped conditions in the calibration (accuracy)

being characterized by strong interactions between neighboring voids. A simple
semi-analytical coalescence criterion for porous single crystals with periodic
arrangement of voids is proposed using effective isotropic yield stresses
associated with a criterion derived for isotropic materials. An extension of
the coalescence criterion is also proposed to account for shear with respect to
the coalescence plane. Effective yield stresses are defined using Taylor theory
of single crystal deformation, and rely ultimately on the computation of
average Taylor factors. Arbitrary sets of slip systems can be considered. The
coalescence criterion is assessed through comparisons to numerical limit
analysis results performed using a Fast-Fourier-Transform based solver. A good
agreement is observed between the proposed criterion and numerical results for
various configurations including different sets of slip systems
(Face-Centered-Cubic, Hexagonal-Close-Packed), crystal orientations, void
shapes and loading conditions. The competition between void growth and void

property of quantum states, quantified by coherence measures, is a distinct
feature to distinguish quantum mechanics from classical theories. In
literature, witness and quantification of coherence with trusted devices have
been well-studied. However, it remains open whether we can witness and quantify
single party coherence with untrusted devices, as it is not clear whether the

DI witness and quantification of coherence with untrusted devices. First, we
prove a no-go theorem for a fully DI scenario, as well as a semi DI scenario
employing a joint measurement with trusted ancillary states. We then propose a

coherence is a fundamental resource for tasks such as quantum random number

also have been important and possibly built up the majority of the inner halo.
In this work we focus on the Helmi streams, a group of streams crossing the
Solar vicinity and known for almost two decades. We characterize their
properties and relevance for the build-up of the Milky Way's halo. We identify
new members of the Helmi streams in an unprecedented dataset with full
phase-space information combining Gaia DR2, and the APOGEE DR2, RAVE DR5 and
LAMOST DR4 spectroscopic surveys. Based on the orbital properties of the stars,
we find new stream members up to a distance of 5 kpc from the Sun, which we
characterize using photometry and metallicity information. We also perform
N-body experiments to constrain the time of accretion and properties of the
progenitor of the streams. We find nearly 600 new members of the Helmi streams.
Their HR diagram reveals a broad age range, from approximately 11 to 13 Gyr,
while their metallicity distribution goes from $\sim$ 2.3 to $\sim$1.0, and
peaks at [Fe/H] $\sim$1.5. These findings confirm that the streams originate in
a dwarf galaxy. Furthermore, we find 7 globular clusters to be likely
associated, and which follow a well-defined age-metallicity sequence whose
properties suggest a relatively massive progenitor object. Our N-body
simulations favour a system with a stellar mass of $\sim
10^8\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ accreted $5 - 8$ Gyr ago. The debris from the Helmi
streams is an important donor to the MilkyWay halo, contributing approximately
15\% of its mass in field stars and 10\% of its globular clusters.

for these simpler dyadic models. For the next decade the technique used to get
sharp weighted inequalities was the Bellman function method introduced by
Nazarov, Treil, and Volberg, paired with sharp extrapolation by
Dragi\v{c}evi\'c et al. Other methods where introduced by Hyt\""onen, Lerner,
Cruz-Uribe, Martell, P\'erez, Lacey, Reguera, Sawyer, Uriarte-Tuero, involving
stopping time and median oscillation arguments, precursors of the very
successful domination by positive sparse operators methodology. The culmination
of this work was Tuomas Hyt\""onen's 2012 proof of the $A_2$ conjecture based on
a representation formula for any Calder\'on-Zygmund operator as an average of
appropriate dyadic operators. Since then domination by sparse dyadic operators
has taken central stage and has found applications well beyond Hyt\""onen's
$A_p$ theorem. We will survey this remarkable progression and more in these
lecture notes.

order to reduce power consumption and lower the execution time. However, to
communicate to the cloud server over a wireless channel, additional energy is
consumed for transmitting the data. Also a delay is introduced for offloading
the data and receiving the response. Therefore, an optimal decision needs to be
made that would reduce the energy consumption, while simultaneously satisfying
the delay constraint. In this paper, we obtain an optimal closed form solution
for these decision variables in a multi-user scenario. Furthermore, we
optimally allocate the cloud server resources to the user devices, and evaluate
the minimum delay that the system can provide, for a given bandwidth and number

  Synchronization in Distributed SDN","7 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In distributed software-defined networks (SDN), multiple physical SDN
controllers, each managing a network domain, are implemented to balance
centralized control, scalability and reliability requirements. In such
networking paradigm, controllers synchronize with each other to maintain a
logically centralized network view. Despite various proposals of distributed
SDN controller architectures, most existing works only assume that such
logically centralized network view can be achieved with some synchronization
designs, but the question of how exactly controllers should synchronize with
each other to maximize the benefits of synchronization under the eventual
consistency assumptions is largely overlooked. To this end, we formulate the
controller synchronization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and apply
reinforcement learning techniques combined with deep neural network to train a
smart controller synchronization policy, which we call the Deep-Q (DQ)
Scheduler. Evaluation results show that DQ Scheduler outperforms the
antientropy algorithm implemented in the ONOS controller by up to 95.2% for
inter-domain routing tasks.

scalable approaches to operate such networks is pressing. Decentralization and
locality are key concepts to provide scalability. Existing models for which
local algorithms are designed fail to model an important aspect of many modern
communication networks such as software-defined networks: the possibility to
precompute distributed network state. We take this as an opportunity to study
the fundamental question of how and to what extent local algorithms can benefit
from preprocessing. In particular, we show that preprocessing allows for
significant speedups of various networking problems. A main benefit is the
precomputation of structural primitives, where purely distributed algorithms
have to start from scratch. Maybe surprisingly, we also show that there are
strict limitations on how much preprocessing can help in different scenarios.
To this end, we provide approximation bounds for the maximum independent set
problem---which however show that our obtained speedups are asymptotically
optimal. Even though we show that physical link failures in general hinder the
power of preprocessing, we can still facilitate the precomputation of symmetry
breaking processes to bypass various runtime barriers. We believe that our
model and results are of interest beyond the scope of this paper and apply to
other dynamic networks as well.

efficiency reasons may execute instructions in an order different to that
specified by the program text. The consequences of instruction reordering can
be complex and subtle, and can impact on ensuring correctness. In this paper we
build on extensive work elucidating the semantics of assembler-level languages
on hardware architectures with weak memory models (specifically TSO, ARM and
POWER) and lift the principles to a straightforward operational semantics which
allows reasoning at a higher level of abstraction. To this end we introduce a
wide-spectrum language that encompasses operations on abstract data types as
well as low-level assembler code, define its operational semantics using a
novel approach to allowing reordering of instructions, and derive some
refinement laws that can be used to explain behaviours of real processors. In
this framework memory models are mostly distinguished via a pair-wise static
ordering on instruction types that determines when later instructions may be
reordered before earlier instructions. In addition, memory models may use
different types of storage systems. For instance, non-multicopy atomic systems
allow sibling processes to see updates to different variables in different
orders.
  We encode the semantics in the rewriting engine Maude as a model-checking
tool, and develop confidence in our framework by validating our semantics
against existing sets of \textit{litmus tests} -- small assembler programs --
comparing our results with those observed on hardware and in existing
semantics. We also use the tool as a prototype to model check implementations
of data structures from the literature against their abstract specifications.

a monovalent metal can be considered as a Fermi surface effect. Only relatively
small number of electron states close to the Fermi surface are diamagnetically
active whereas the majority of the electron states inside the Fermi surface are
diamagnetically inert. This partitioning of the occupied electron states is
driven by the structure of Landau levels, around which one can introduce
magnetic tubes in the reciprocal space. Completely filled magnetic tubes do not
change their energy in an applied magnetic field, and only partially occupied
magnetic tubes in the neighborhood of the Fermi surface exhibit a diamagnetic
response. Using this partitioning of the occupied electron states we derive a
general expression for the steady diamagnetic susceptibility, for calculation
of which one needs to know the shape of the Fermi surface and the energy
gradient on it. The method is applied to alkali metals, whose Fermi surfaces
and energy gradients have been obtained from ab initio band structure
calculations. It has been found that the Landau diamagnetic susceptibility is
anisotropic depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field in respect
to the Fermi surface. This effect is more pronounced for Li and Cs, whose Fermi
surfaces show a noticeable deformation from the spherical shape. The method
opens a new route for ab initio calculations of the Landau diamagnetism of
metals or intermetallic compounds. In the case of free electron gas it is shown
that this approach also fully describes the oscillatory de Haas - van Alphen
part of the diamagnetic susceptibility. Small oscillations of the Fermi energy
found in the model are caused by redistribution (inflow or outflow) of
electrons from the equatorial region of the Fermi surface.

(N2LO) PT corrections in the chiral limit, next-to-leading order (NLO) SU3 PT

conclude, within the errors, that the observed XZ states are good candidates
for being 1^{++} and 0^{++} molecules or/and four-quark states, contrary to the
observed Y states which are too light compared to the predicted 1^{-\pm} and
0^{-\pm} states. We find that the SU3 breakings are relatively small for the

large (< 20%) for the couplings which decrease faster (1/m_{b}^{3/2}) than

separate (within the errors) molecules from four-quark states having the same

proteins. Furthermore, these curved membrane proteins are often associated with
the recruitment of the cytoskeleton, which then applies active forces that
deform the membrane. This coupling between curvature and activity was
previously explored theoretically in the linear limit of small deformations,
and low dimensionality. Here we explore the unrestricted shapes of vesicles
that contain active curved membrane proteins, in three-dimensions, using
Monte-Carlo numerical simulations. The activity of the proteins is in the form
of protrusive forces that push the membrane outwards, as may arise from the
cytoskeleton of the cell due to actin or microtubule polymerization occurring
near the membrane. For proteins that have an isotropic convex shape, the
additional protrusive force enhances their tendency to aggregate and form
membrane protrusions (buds). In addition, we find another transition from
deformed spheres with necklace type aggregates, to flat pancake-shaped
vesicles, where the curved proteins line the outer rim. This second transition
is driven by the active forces, coupled to the spontaneous curvature, and the
resulting configurations may shed light on the organization of the lamellipodia

it essential to consider how such systems may impact social good. Various
modifications to recommendation algorithms have been proposed to improve their
performance for specific socially relevant measures. However, previous
proposals are often not easily adapted to different measures, and they
generally require the ability to modify either existing system inputs, the
system's algorithm, or the system's outputs. As an alternative, in this paper
we introduce the idea of improving the social desirability of recommender
system outputs by adding more data to the input, an approach we view as
providing `antidote' data to the system. We formalize the antidote data
problem, and develop optimization-based solutions. We take as our model system
the matrix factorization approach to recommendation, and we propose a set of
measures to capture the polarization or fairness of recommendations. We then
show how to generate antidote data for each measure, pointing out a number of
computational efficiencies, and discuss the impact on overall system accuracy.
Our experiments show that a modest budget for antidote data can lead to
significant improvements in the polarization or fairness of recommendations.

world clothing, we propose a new computational framework that recasts three
dimensional cloth deformation as an RGB image in a two dimensional pattern
space. Then a three dimensional animation of cloth is equivalent to a sequence
of two dimensional RGB images, which in turn are driven/choreographed via
animation parameters such as joint angles. This allows us to leverage popular
CNNs to learn cloth deformations in image space. The two dimensional cloth
pixels are extended into the real world via standard body skinning techniques,
after which the RGB values are interpreted as texture offsets and displacement
maps. Notably, we illustrate that our approach does not require accurate
unclothed body shapes or robust skinning techniques. Additionally, we discuss
how standard image based techniques such as image partitioning for higher
resolution, GANs for merging partitioned image regions back together, etc., can
readily be incorporated into our framework.

dataset. Although training and testing are performed on different subsets of
the dataset, models built on one study show limited capability to generalize to
other studies. While database bias has been recognized as a serious problem in
the computer vision community, it has remained largely unnoticed in medical
imaging research. Transfer learning thus remains confined to the re-use of
feature representations requiring re-training on the new dataset. As a result,
machine learning models do not generalize even when trained on imaging datasets
that were captured to study the same variable of interest. The ability to
transfer knowledge gleaned from one study to another, without the need for
re-training, if possible, would provide reassurance that the models are
learning knowledge fundamental to the problem under study instead of latching
onto the idiosyncracies of a dataset. In this paper, we situate the problem of
dataset bias in the context of medical imaging studies. We show empirical
evidence that such a problem exists in medical datasets. We then present a
framework to unlearn study membership as a means to handle the problem of
database bias. Our main idea is to take the data from the original feature
space to an intermediate space where the data points are indistinguishable in
terms of which study they come from, while maintaining the recognition
capability with respect to the variable of interest. This will promote models
which learn the more general properties of the etiology under study instead of
aligning to dataset-specific peculiarities. Essentially, our proposed model
learns to unlearn the dataset bias.

energy is the size of the future event horizon. This model gives a holographic
dark energy comparable to the observational data. Though this model is in good
agreement with observational data, some problems (non-locality, circular logic,
causality problem, $\it etc.$) exist due to the use of the future event horizon
as a present IR cut-off. These problems of the holographic dark energy model
are considerably resolved using action principle and equations of motion.

We introduced the method named ""reading periodic table"" which represented the
periodic table in a way that allows deep learning to learn to read the periodic
table and to learn the law of elements for the purpose of discovering novel
superconductors that are outside the training data. It is recognized that it is
difficult for deep learning to predict something outside the training data.

Non-superconductors are not reported, but the data must be required for deep
learning to distinguish between superconductors and non-superconductors. We
obtained three remarkable results. The deep learning can predict
superconductivity for a material with a precision of 62%, which shows the
usefulness of the model; it found the recently discovered superconductor CaBi2

suggests that when the number of aerosols increases, it will act to suppress
precipitation. However, recent studies on satellite observations have found
that aerosols are positively correlated with precipitation, which is contrary
to conventional views. This study attempts to use the A-Train satellite product
to verify the correlation between aerosol and precipitation, and further
reveals the possible physical mechanism of the positive relationship between
aerosols and precipitation in satellite observations through the
three-dimensional structure of clouds. The study found that the precipitation
intensity is positively correlated with the aerosol optical depth, while the
relationship between the cloud droplet concentration and the precipitation
intensity is related to the liquid water path; and when the number of aerosols
increases, the radar reflectance spectrum is widened, and the precipitation
increases, while the cloud droplet concentration shows the opposite phenomenon.
It can be concluded that the possible cause of positive correlation between
aerosol and precipitation is the negative correlation between CDNC and AOD.

(SM), which has been shown to be energy efficient in many applications,
including LiFi. We consider two configurations for placing the photodiodes
(PDs) on the user equipment (UE). The first one is referred to as the screen
receiver (SR) whereby all the PDs are located on one face of the UE, whereas
the other one is a multi-directional receiver (MDR), in which the PDs are
located on different sides of the UE. The latter configuration was motivated by
the fact that SR exhibited poor performance in the presence of random device
orientation and blockage. We show that MDR outperforms SR by over $10$ dB at
BER of $3.8\times10^{-3}$. Moreover, an adaptive access point (AP) selection
scheme for SM is considered where the number of APs are chosen adaptively in an
effort to achieve the lowest energy requirement for a target BER and spectral
efficiency. The user performance with random orientation and blockage in the
whole room is evaluated for sitting and walking activities. For the latter, we
invoke the orientation-based random waypoint (ORWP) mobility model. We also
study the performance of the underlying system on the uplink channel where the
same techniques are used for the downlink channel. Specifically, as the
transmitted uplink power is constrained, the energy efficiency of SM is
evaluated analytically. It is shown that the multi-directional transmitter
(MDT) with adaptive SM is highly energy efficient. As a benchmark, we compare
the performance of the proposed framework to that of the conventional spatial
multiplexing system, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed one.

relations that do not lead to an instability, the energy levels of the cavity
are non-trivial functions of $v$. In other words, an observer could in
principle measure their velocity with respect to the preferred frame by

robustness of the detection of relevant time periods. Second, we propose a
formal retrieval model that generalizes the use of the temporal dimension

temporal evidence of external collections can be used to (i) infer a topic's

  Vehicle Networks","This work is a pre-print version to appear at MobiCom 2019",,,,"eess.SP cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the ever-growing concerns on air pollution and energy security, many
cities have started to update their taxi fleets with electric ones. Although
environmentally friendly, the rapid promotion of electric taxis raises problems
to both taxi drivers and governments, e.g., prolonged waiting/charging time,
unbalanced utilization of charging infrastructures and reduced taxi supply due
to the long charging time. In this paper, we make the first effort to
understand the long-term evolving patterns through a five-year study on one of
the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric
taxi network in China. In particular, we perform a comprehensive measurement
investigation called ePat to explore the evolving mobility and charging
patterns of electric vehicles. Our ePat is based on 4.8 TB taxi GPS data, 240
GB taxi transaction data, and metadata from 117 charging stations, during an
evolving process from 427 electric taxis in 2013 to 13,178 in 2018. Moreover,
ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the
evolving process. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric
taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the
understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the
way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.

  Millimeter-Wave 5G Networks","This article has been accepted for publication at the IEEE GLOBECOM
  2018 Workshops, Abu Dhabi, UAE, 9-13 December 2018",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands offer a new frontier for
next-generation wireless networks, popularly known as 5G, to enable
multi-gigabit communication; however, the availability and reliability of
mmWave signals are significantly limited due to its unfavorable propagation
characteristics. Thus, mmWave networks rely on directional narrow-beam
transmissions to overcome severe path-loss. To mitigate the impact of
transmission-reception directionality and provide uninterrupted network
services, ensuring the availability of mmWave transmission links is important.
In this paper, we proposed a new flexible network architecture to provide
efficient resource coordination among serving basestations during user
mobility. The key idea of this holistic architecture is to exploit the
software-defined networking (SDN) technology with mmWave communication to
provide a flexible and resilient network architecture. Besides, this paper
presents an efficient and seamless uncoordinated network operation to support
reliable communication in highly-dynamic environments characterized by high
density and mobility of wireless devices. To warrant high-reliability and guard
against the potential radio link failure, we introduce a new transmission
framework to ensure that there is at least one basestation is connected to the
UE at all times. We validate the proposed transmission scheme through
simulations.

result, security technology has become a major help to protect our daily life.

authenticated users. The classifier is trained by using a new adaptive learning
method. The training data are initially collected from social networks. The
accuracy of the classifier is incrementally improved as the user starts using

TensorFlow, it will be easy to reuse the framework to adopt with many devices

functional requirements of the CV applications meet the latency requirements
imposed by corresponding CV applications. We conducted a case study to evaluate
the efficacy of CVDeP using two CV applications (one safety and one mobility
application) and validated them through a field evaluation at the Clemson
University Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Testbed (CU-CAVT). The analysis
outcome proves the efficacy of CVDeP, which satisfies the functional
requirements (e.g., latency, throughput) of a CV application while maintaining
scalability, and security of the platform and applications.

this paper we introduce the design and a prototype of a service, provided to a
doctor and a patient, for the on-line remote visualization of patient's 3-leads

off-the-shelf devices to implement the sensor on patient's side, a browser on a
laptop PC on the doctor's side as viewer, and a cloud container to connect the
two using Websockets. A prototype is built to evaluate signal latency, power
consumption of the patient side device, and the quality of the rendering. After
some experiments, latency is measured below $1sec$, and power consumption is
estimated in the 2A*3.3V range; visualization is comparable to commercial,
non-diagnostic products. The prototype patient device is portable, and can be
operated using rechargeable battery packs. Its cost is below 100\$, and all the
required equipment is commercially available. The architecture is ready for on
field evaluation, and we indicate how to improve power consumption while
reducing cost.

of graph properties. Although there are already perturbation methods proposed
to tackle this problem, they are limited by the fact that the strength of the
perturbation cannot be well controlled. We firstly provide a perturbation
framework on graphs by introducing weights on the nodes, of which the magnitude
of perturbation can be easily controlled through the variance of the weights.
Meanwhile, the topology of the graphs are also preserved to avoid
uncontrollable strength in the perturbation. We then extend the measure of
robustness in the robust statistics literature to the graph properties.

been a principal challenge in the field of metasurfaces. In this letter, we
demonstrate a device platform for achieving reconfigurable control over the
resonant wavelength of a subwavelength optical antenna through free-carrier
injection. We engineer and grow, using molecular beam epitaxy, a
heterostructure of In1-xAlxAs/InAs/AlyGa1-ySb layers designed to achieve large
amplitude and phase modulation of light by maximizing the refractive index
change in regions of resonant field enhancement The p-i-n layers are grown on a
heavily doped n-InAs layer which forms a reflecting substrate to confine the
Mie resonances within the nanowires of the index tunable layers. We outline the
fabrication process developed to form such tunable metasurface elements using a
four-step projection lithography process and a self-aligned vertical dry etch.
We experimentally demonstrate the operation of an electrically reconfigurable
optical antenna element where the resonant wavelength blue shifts by 200nm only
during carrier-injection. We extrapolate the experimentally measured InAs
refractive index shifts to show we can achieve nearly {\pi} phase shift in a
metasurface array. This solid-state device platform enables us to contact each
resonant element independently to form a truly reconfigurable Fourier optical
element with the promise of arbitrary control of the electromagnetic wavefront
at the subwavelength scale.
