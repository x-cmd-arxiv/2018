transition (SIT) in quasi-two-dimensional superconductors is expected to occur
when the applied magnetic-field crosses a certain critical value. A fundamental
question is whether this transition is due to the localization of Cooper pairs
or due to the destruction of them. Here we address this question by studying
the SIT in amorphous WSi. Transport measurements reveal the localization of
Cooper pairs at a quantum critical field B_c^1 (Bose-insulator), with a product
of the correlation length and dynamical exponents zv~4/3 near the quantum
critical point (QCP). Beyond B_c^1, superconducting fluctuations still persist
at finite temperatures. Above a second critical field B_c^2>B_c^1, the Cooper
pairs are destroyed and the film becomes a Fermi-insulator. The different
phases all merge at a tricritical point at finite temperatures with zv=2/3. Our
results suggest a sequential superconductor to Bose insulator to Fermi
insulator phase transition, which differs from the conventional scenario
involving a single quantum critical point.

increase and decrease in the disk accretion rate is accompanied by a
modification of the disk magnetization $\mu \propto B_z^2/\dot{m}_{in}$, which
in turn determines the dominant torque allowing accretion. For $\mu>0.1$, the
accretion flow produces jets that vertically, carry away the disk angular
momentum (jet-emitting disk or JED). The goal of this paper is to investigate
the spectral signatures of the JED configurations. We have developed a
two-temperature plasma code that computes the disk local thermal equilibria,
taking into account the advection of energy in an iterative way. Our code
addresses optically thin-to-thick transitions, both radiation and gas supported
regimes and computes in a consistent way the emitted spectrum from a
steady-state disk. The optically thin emission is obtained using the BELM code,
which provides accurate spectra for bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission
processes as well as for their local Comptonization. For a range in radius and
accretion rates, JEDs exhibit three thermal equilibria, one thermally unstable
and two stables. Due to the existence of two thermally stable solutions, a
hysteresis cycle is naturally obtained. However, standard outbursting X-ray
binary cycles cannot be reproduced. Another striking feature of JEDs is their
ability to reproduce luminous hard states. Showing that when the loss of
angular momentum and power in jets is consistently taken into account,
accretion disks have spectral signatures that are consistent with hard states,
even up to high luminosities. The reproduction of soft states being well
performed by standard accretion disks (SAD), this study argues for the
existence of hybrid disk configuration: JED and SAD. A study of such hybrid
configuration will be presented in a forthcoming paper III.

proposal for obtaining the gauge field configurations in the Yang-Mills theory
from the solutions of the field equations in the ""complementary"" gauge-scalar
model with the radial length of the scalar field being fixed. The
gauge-invariant mass term is obtained through a change of variables and a
gauge-independent description of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism which
neither relies on the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry nor on the
assumptions of the nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the scalar field.
According to these procedures, we solve under the static and spherically
symmetric ansatz the field equations of the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled
with an adjoint scalar field whose radial degree of freedom is fixed, and
obtain a gauge field configuration of magnetic monopole with a minimum magnetic

monopole obtained in this way in the massive Yang--Mills theory with the
Wu-Yang magnetic monopole in the pure Yang-Mills theory and the 't

capable of providing computational advantages over classical computers, it
seems likely that such computers will, initially at least, be required to run
in a hybrid quantum-classical regime. This realisation has led to interest in
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms allowing, for example, quantum computers to
solve large problems despite having very limited numbers of qubits. Here we
propose a hybrid paradigm for quantum annealers with the goal of mitigating a
different limitation of such devices: the need to embed problem instances
within the (often highly restricted) connectivity graph of the annealer. This
embedding process can be costly to perform and may destroy any computational
speedup. In order to solve many practical problems, it is moreover necessary to
perform many, often related, such embeddings. We will show how, for such
problems, a raw speedup that is negated by the embedding time can nonetheless
be exploited to give a real speedup. As a proof-of-concept example we present
an in-depth case study of a simple problem based on the maximum weight
independent set problem. Although we do not observe a quantum speedup
experimentally, the advantage of the hybrid approach is robustly verified,
showing how a potential quantum speedup may be exploited and encouraging
further efforts to apply the approach to problems of more practical interest.

In many applications, pre-specified restrictions are imposed on the parameter
space of latent class models, through a design matrix, to reflect
practitioners' assumptions about how the observed responses depend on subjects'
latent traits. Though widely used in various fields, such restricted latent
class models suffer from non-identifiability due to their discreteness nature
and complex structure of restrictions. This work addresses the fundamental
identifiability issue of restricted latent class models by developing a general
framework for strict and partial identifiability of the model parameters. Under
correct model specification, the developed identifiability conditions only
depend on the design matrix and are easily checkable, which provide useful

people explore and share information of interest. They host a huge amount of
users' activities including explicit RSVP, shared photos, comments and social
connections. Exploiting these activities to detect communities of similar users
is a challenging problem. In reality, a community in event-based social network
(ESBN) is a group of users not only sharing common events and friends, but also
having similar topical interests. However, such community could not be detected
by most of existing methods which mainly draw on link analysis in the network.
To address this problem, there is a need to capitalize on the semantics of
shared objects along with the structural properties, and to generate
overlapping communities rather than disjoint ones. In this paper, we propose to
leverage the users' activities around events with the aim to detect communities
based on topical clustering and link analysis that maximize a new form of
semantic modularity. We particularly highlight the difference between online
and offline social interactions, and the influence of event categories to
detect communities. Experimental results on real datasets showed that our
approach was able to detect semantically meaningful communities compared with
existing state of the art methods.

We analyze the contributions of the quartic Higgs coupling, including the

form factor, to the vector-boson-fusion and the vector-boson associated
di-Higgs productions at one-loop level. Such an effect is independent of the

di-Higgs productions is important for optimizing the collider sensitivities to
probe the quartic Higgs coupling. With this guideline, we explore the ILC and
CLIC sensitivities, and find that the ILC has a potential to measure the
quartic Higgs coupling, normalized by its SM value, with a precision of $\sim

theoretical analyses could elucidate these phenomena, such methods have rarely
been used in realistic (large-dimensional) gap-junction coupled heterogeneous
pacemaker tissue models. In this study, we adapt a recent model of pacemaker
cells (Severi et al. 2012), incorporating biophysical representations of ion
channel and intracellular calcium dynamics, to capture physiological features
of a heterogeneous population of pacemaker cells, in particular ""center"" and
""peripheral"" cells with distinct intrinsic frequencies and action potential
morphology. Large-scale simulations of the SAN tissue, represented by a
heterogeneous tissue structure of pacemaker cells, exhibit a rich repertoire of
behaviors, including complete synchrony, traveling waves of activity
originating from periphery to center, and transient traveling waves originating
from the center. We use phase reduction methods that do not require fully
simulating the large-scale model to capture these observations. Moreover, the
phase reduced models accurately predict key properties of the tissue electrical
dynamics, including wave frequencies when synchronization occurs, and wave
propagation direction in a variety of tissue models. With the reduced phase
models, we analyze the relationship between cell distributions and coupling
strengths and the resulting transient dynamics. Further, the reduced phase
model predicts parameter regimes of irregular electrical dynamics. Thus, we
demonstrate that phase reduced oscillator models applied to realistic pacemaker

that the stress to thermal pressure ratio $\alpha$ varied with peak values of

enhancement of $\alpha$ near the tip of the upper branch caused by convection;
this increase in $\alpha$ occurred despite our choice of zero net vertical

disk simulations are that AM CVn disks are capable of exhibiting persistent

non-ideal MHD effects are likely important in quiescence. By combining our

cell spreading is studied extensively, and important universal relationships
are established on how the cell area grows with time. Here we study the

processes involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the
individual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the
substrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is
observed. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time
statistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier
dG=19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law $t^5$. This
implies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of
adhesion-mechanosensing complex assembly and activation: the operational
complex must have 5 component proteins, and the last process in the sequence

the binding energy dG.

curve shape. As a result, designs for more complex clinical trials, for
example, trials looking at schedules of a combination treatment involving TA,
have not been extensively studied yet. We propose a novel regimen-finding
design which is based on a derived efficacy-toxicity trade-off function. Due to
its special properties, an accurate regimen selection can be achieved without
any parametric or monotonicity assumptions. We illustrate how this design can
be applied in the context of a complex combination-schedule clinical trial. We
discuss practical and ethical issues such as coherence, delayed and missing
efficacy responses, safety and futility constraints.

relatively unexplored as their observation necessitates time resolution much
shorter than conventional photon counters. Integrating nonlinear optical gating
with conventional photon counters can overcome this limitation and enable
subpicosecond time resolution. Here, using this technique and a Franson
interferometer, we demonstrate high-visibility quantum interference with two
entangled photons, where the one- and two-photon coherence times are both
subpicosecond. We directly observe the spectral and temporal interference
patterns, measure a visibility in the two-photon coincidence rate of
$(85.3\pm0.4)\%$, and report a CHSH-Bell parameter of $2.42\pm0.02$, violating

periodic solids to continuous wave light using a perturbative formula, which is
linear in the intensity of light and which involves Berry connection describing
the shift in the center of mass position of the Wannier wave function
associated with the transition between the valence and conduction bands. We
analyze realistic two-terminal devices, where paradigmatic Rice-Mele model is
sandwiched between two metallic electrodes, using recently developed
time-dependent nonequilibrium Green function algorithms scaling linearly in the
number of time steps and capable of treating nonperturbative effects in the
amplitude of external time-dependent fields. This unveils novel features:
superballistic transport, signified by time dependence of the displacement,
$\sim t^\nu$ with $\nu > 1$, of the photoexcited charge carriers from the
region where the femtosecond light pulse is applied toward the electrodes; and
photocurrent quadratic in light intensity at subgap frequencies of light due to
two-photon absorption processes that were missed in previous perturbative
analyses. Furthermore, frequency dependence of the DC component of the
photocurrent reveals shift currents as a realization of nonadiabatic quantum
charge pumping enabled by breaking of left-right symmetry of the device
structure. This demonstrates that a much wider class of systems, than the
usually considered polar noncentrosymmetric bulk materials, can be exploited to
generate nonzero DC component of photocurrent in response to unpolarized light
and optimize shift-current-based solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

the matrix Bochner problem, the classification of $N \times N$ weight matrices
$W(x)$ whose associated orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a second
order differential operator. Based on techniques from noncommutative algebra
(semiprime PI algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension one), we construct a
framework for the systematic study of the structure of the algebra $\mathcal
D(W)$ of matrix differential operators for which the orthogonal polynomials of
the weight matrix $W(x)$ are eigenfunctions. The ingredients for this algebraic
setting are derived from the analytic properties of the orthogonal matrix
polynomials. We use the representation theory of the algebras $\mathcal D(W)$
to resolve the matrix Bochner problem under the two natural assumptions that
the sum of the sizes of the matrix algebras in the central localization of
$\mathcal D(W)$ equals $N$ (fullness of $\mathcal D(W)$) and the leading
coefficient of the second order differential operator multiplied by the weight
$W(x)$ is positive definite. In the case of $2\times 2$ weights, it is proved
that fullness is satisfied as long as $\mathcal D(W)$ is noncommutative. The
two conditions are natural in that without them the problem is equivalent to
much more general ones by artificially increasing the size of the matrix

processes subject to blocking when the channel conveying the particles becomes
too crowded. If the blockage is temporary, which means that after a finite time
the channel is flushed and reopened, one expects to observe a maximum
throughput for a finite intensity of entering particles. We investigate this
phenomenon by introducing a queueing theory inspired, circular Markov model.
Particles enter a channel with intensity $\lambda$ and exit at a rate $\mu$. If
$N$ particles are present at the same time in the channel, the system becomes
blocked and no more particles can enter until the blockage is cleared after an
exponentially distributed time with rate $\mu^*$. We obtain an exact expression
for the steady state throughput (including the exiting blocked particles) for
all values of $N$. For $N=2$ we show that the throughput assumes a maximum
value for finite $\lambda$ if $\mu^*/\mu < 1/4$. The time-dependent throughput
either monotonically approaches the steady state value, or reaches a maximum
value at finite time. We demonstrate that, in the steady state, this model can
be mapped to a previously introduced non-Markovian model with fixed transit and
blockage times.
  We also examine an irreversible, non-Markovian blockage process with constant
transit time exposed to an entering flux of fixed intensity for a finite time

particles are maximized for a finite intensity.

interpret the array of new observational data in this field. However, each of
the two main theories (core accretion, gravitational instability) is unable to
explain some key aspects. In many planet formation calculations, it is usual to
treat the initial properties of the planet forming disc (mass, radius, etc.) as
free parameters. In this paper, we stress the importance of setting the
formation of planet forming discs within the context of the formation of the
central stars. By exploring the early stages of disc formation, we introduce
the concept of the Maximum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN), as opposed to the oft-used
Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (here mmsn). It is evident that almost all
protoplanetary discs start their evolution in a strongly self-gravitating
state. In agreement with almost all previous work in this area, we conclude
that on the scales relevant to planet formation these discs are not
gravitationally unstable to gas fragmentation, but instead form strong,
transient spiral arms. These spiral arms can act as efficient dust traps
allowing the accumulation and subsequent fragmentation of the dust (but not the
gas). This phase is likely to populate the disc with relatively large
planetesimals on short timescales while the disc is still veiled by a dusty-gas
envelope. Crucially, the early formation of large planetesimals overcomes the
main barriers remaining within the core accretion model. A prediction of this
picture is that essentially all observable protoplanetary discs are already
planet hosting.

reveals that the fraction of the [CII] line emission that arises from neutral
gas increases from 60% to 90% in the most active star-forming regions and that
the emission originating in the ionized gas is associated with low-ionization,
diffuse gas rather than with dense gas in HII regions. Finally, we report the
global and spatially resolved line fluxes of the SHINING galaxies to enable the
comparison and planning of future local and high-$z$ studies.

a valuable probe of SN Ia progenitors and physics, and of the role of SNe Ia in
cosmic metal enrichment. The SN Ia rate in galaxy clusters as a function of
cluster redshift is an almost-direct measure of the DTD, but current estimates
have been limited out to a mean redshift z=1.1, corresponding to time delays,
after cluster star-formation, of over 3.2 Gyr. We analyze data from a Hubble
Space Telescope monitoring project of 12 galaxy clusters at z=1.13-1.75, where
we discover 29 SNe, and present their multi-band light curves. Based on the SN
photometry and the apparent host galaxies, we assess cluster membership and SN
type, finding 11 cases that are likely SNe Ia in cluster galaxies and 4 more
cases which are possible but not certain cluster SNe Ia. We conduct simulations
to estimate the SN detection efficiency, the experiment's completeness, and the
photometric errors, and perform photometry of the cluster galaxies to derive
the cluster stellar masses. Separating the cluster sample into high-z and low-z
bins, we obtain rest-frame SN Ia rates per unit formed stellar mass of $2.2
^{+2.6}_{-1.3}\times 10^{-13}{\rm yr}^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ at a mean

rates, we fit the DTD, now down to delays of 1.5 Gyr, with a power-law
dependence, $t^\alpha$, with $\alpha=-1.30^{+0.23}_{-0.16}$. We confirm
previous indications for a Hubble-time-integrated SN Ia production efficiency
that is several times higher in galaxy clusters than in the field, perhaps
caused by a peculiar stellar initial mass function in clusters, or by a higher
incidence of binaries that will evolve into SNe Ia.

opportunity to study the properties of the ionized and neutral media of
galaxies from prototypical starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGN) to
heavily obscured objects. Based on Herschel/PACS observations of the main
far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines, in this paper we analyze the physical
mechanisms behind the observed line deficits in galaxies, the apparent offset
of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) from the mass-metallicity relation, and
the scaling relations between [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission and star formation
rate (SFR). Based on a toy model and the Cloudy code, we conclude that the
increase in the ionization parameter with FIR surface brightness can explain
the observed decrease in the line-to-FIR continuum ratio of galaxies. In the
case of the [CII] line, the increase in the ionization parameter is accompanied
by a reduction in the photoelectric heating efficiency and the inability of the
line to track the increase in the FUV radiation field as galaxies become more
compact and luminous. In the central $\sim$kiloparsec regions of AGN galaxies
we observe a significant increase in the [OI] 63 $\mu$m/[CII] line ratio; the
AGN impact on the line-to-FIR ratios fades on global scales. Based on
extinction-insensitive metallicity measurements of LIRGs we confirm that they
lie below the mass-metallicity relation, but the offset is smaller than those
reported in studies that use optical-based metal abundances. Finally, we
present scaling relations between [CII] emission and SFR in the context of the
main-sequence of star-forming galaxies.

ground-based data decisively favor the planetary model. This is a new channel
to resolve the 2L1S/1L2S degeneracy, which can be difficult to break in some

this type of effects. Our study is the first atmospheric neutrino analysis

significantly change the evolution of the binary stellar components. In
particular, striping the envelope of an evolved star can give rise to a core
remnant, which can later evolve into a WD with significantly different

produces shocks. Shocks in clusters emerge out of merger or accretion, but
which one is more effective in producing CRs? at which dynamical phase? and
why? To this aim, we study the production or injection of CRs through shocks
and its evolution in the galaxy clusters using cosmological simulations with
the {\sc enzo} code. Particle acceleration model considered here is primarily
the Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of thermal particles, but we also report
a tentative study with pre-existing CRs. Defining appropriate dynamical states
using the concept of virialization, we studied a sample of merging and
non-merging clusters. We report that the merger shocks (with Mach number
$\mathcal{M}\sim2-5$) are the most effective CR producers, while high-Mach
peripheral shocks (i.e. $\mathcal{M}>5$) are mainly responsible for the
brightest phase of CR injection in clusters. Clusters once merged, permanently
deviate from CR and X-ray mass scaling of non-merging systems, enabling us to
use it as a tool to determine the state of merger. Through a temporal and
spatial evolution study, we found a strong correlation between cluster merger
dynamics and CR injection. We observed that the brightest phase of X-ray and CR
injection from clusters occur respectively at about 1.0 and 1.5 Gyr after every
mergers, and CR injection peaks near to the cluster virial radius (i.e
$r_{200}$). Delayed CR injection peaks found in this study deserve further

therefore one of the major open problems in solar and stellar physics. Magnetic
flux concentrations can be produced by the negative effective magnetic pressure
instability (NEMPI). This instability is strongly suppressed by rotation.
However, the presence of an outer coronal envelope was previously found to
strengthen the flux concentrations and make them more prominent. It also allows
for the formation of bipolar regions (BRs). We want to know whether the
presence of an outer coronal envelope also changes the excitation conditions
and the rotational dependence of NEMPI. We use direct numerical simulations and
mean-field simulations. We adopt a simple two-layer model of turbulence that
mimics the jump between the convective turbulent and coronal layers below and
above the surface of a star, respectively. The computational domain is
Cartesian and located at a certain latitude of a rotating sphere. We
investigate the effects of rotation on NEMPI by changing the Coriolis number,
the latitude, and the box resolution. Rotation has a strong impact on the
process of BR formation. Even rather slow rotation is found to suppress their
formation. However, increasing the imposed magnetic field strength also makes
the structures stronger and alleviates the rotational suppression somewhat. The
presence of a coronal layer itself does not significantly alleviate the effects
of rotational suppression.

Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP): finding mappings of request graphs
(describing the workloads) onto a substrate graph (describing the physical
infrastructure). In the offline setting, the two natural objectives are profit
maximization, i.e., embedding a maximal number of request graphs subject to the
resource constraints, and cost minimization, i.e., embedding all requests at
minimal overall cost. The VNEP can be seen as a generalization of classic
routing and call admission problems, in which requests are arbitrary graphs
whose communication endpoints are not fixed. Due to its applications, the
problem has been studied intensively in the networking community. However, the
underlying algorithmic problem is hardly understood.
  This paper presents the first fixed-parameter tractable approximation
algorithms for the VNEP. Our algorithms are based on randomized rounding. Due
to the flexible mapping options and the arbitrary request graph topologies, we
show that a novel linear program formulation is required. Only using this novel
formulation the computation of convex combinations of valid mappings is
enabled, as the formulation needs to account for the structure of the request
graphs. Accordingly, to capture the structure of request graphs, we introduce
the graph-theoretic notion of extraction orders and extraction width and show
that our algorithms have exponential runtime in the request graphs' maximal
width. Hence, for request graphs of fixed extraction width, we obtain the first
polynomial-time approximations.
  Studying the new notion of extraction orders we show that (i) computing
extraction orders of minimal width is NP-hard and (ii) that computing
decomposable LP solutions is in general NP-hard, even when restricting request
graphs to planar ones.

transition T_c and at two second order transitions T_A,B into ordered phases A
and B. Our measurements establish for the first time the boundary of phase B at
high field and low temperature. No evidence for additional high field phases
above B is found up to the maximum field. We speculate based on our
experimental results that i) phase B is similar to phase A of spin-density wave
type and ii) the first order phase transition between A and B is caused by
Fermi surface reconstruction. We furthermore identify a new quantum critical
point at H_c ~ 17T, where T_B is suppresssed to zero, and a bicritical point at
(0.35K, 7.0T), where phase lines T_A(H) and T_B(H) meet.

of deterioration will help doctors prevent readmissions, thus reducing health
care cost and providing patients with just-in-time intervention. Wearable
devices (e.g., wristbands and smart watches) provide a convenient technology
for continuous outpatient monitoring. In the paper, we explore the feasibility
of monitoring outpatients using Fitbit Charge HR wristbands and the potential
of machine learning models to predicting clinical deterioration (readmissions
and death) among outpatients discharged from the hospital. We developed and
piloted a data collection system in a clinical study which involved 25 heart
failure patients recently discharged from a hospital. The results from the
clinical study demonstrated the feasibility of continuously monitoring
outpatients using wristbands. We observed high levels of patient compliance in
wearing the wristbands regularly and satisfactory yield, latency and
reliability of data collection from the wristbands to a cloud-based database.
Finally, we explored a set of machine learning models to predict deterioration
based on the Fitbit data. Through 5-fold cross validation, K nearest neighbor
achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8800 for identifying patients at risk of
deterioration using the health data from the beginning of the monitoring.
Machine learning models based on multimodal data (step, sleep and heart rate)
significantly outperformed the traditional clinical approach based on LACE
index. Moreover, our proposed weighted samples one class SVM model can reach
high accuracy (0.9635) for predicting the deterioration happening in the future
using data collected by a sliding window, which indicates the potential for
allowing timely intervention.

whitepaper outlines key technology challenges for studying the diversity of
worlds in the Galaxy and in searching for habitable planets. Observations of
habitable planets outside of our solar system require technologies enabling the
measurement of (1) spectral signatures of gases in their atmospheres, some of
which may be of biological origin, and (2) planetary mass. Technology gaps must
be closed in many areas. In some cases, performance requirements are 1-2 orders
of magnitude from the current state-of-the-art. Thes technology gaps are in the
areas of: starlight suppression (for reflection or emission spectroscopy;
coronagraphs or starshades, contrast stability, detector sensitivity,
collecting area, spectroscopic sensitivity, radial stellar motion sensitivity,
and tangential stellar motion sensitivity. The technologies advancing to close
these gaps are identified through the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's
(ExEP's) annual Technology Selection and Prioritization Process in
collaboration with the larger exoplanet science and technology communities.
Details can be found in the annual ExEP Technology Plan Appendix. Looking
towards the more distant future, the size of a desired single-aperture space
telescope, even when folded, may exceed current launch capabilities, suggesting
the study of in-space assembly approaches. Additionally, mid-infrared spectral
observations of candidate habitable worlds may be needed to rule out false
positives observed at shorter wavelengths and add supportive evidence.
Consequently, single aperture telescopes may prove impractically large and
space interferometry may be needed, as identified in NASA's 30 year roadmap

cross on a one-dimensional loop in the reciprocal space. For the nodal-loop

close to the Fermi level, relatively flat in energy, simple in its shape, and
not coexisting with other extraneous bands. Here, based on the first-principles

single nodal loop around the Fermi level, protected by either of the two
independent symmetries: the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry and the glide mirror
symmetry. The size of the loop can be effectively tuned by strain, and the loop
can even be annihilated under stain, making a topological phase transition to a
trivial insulator phase. Including the spin-orbit coupling opens a tiny gap at
the loop, and the system becomes a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological semimetal with a
nontrivial bulk $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant but no global bandgap. The
corresponding topological surface states have been identified. We also
construct a low-energy effective model to describe the nodal loop and the
effect of spin-orbit coupling.

with each pair occupying a distinct phase of stellar evolution: two G-dwarfs,

analysis uses near-IR high-resolution spectra ($\lambda$1.5 -- 1.7$\mu$m) from
the APOGEE survey and derives abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca,
Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Our derived stellar parameters and metallicity for

differences relative to the Sun of $\leq$ 0.04 dex for all elements. Chemical
homogeneity is found within each class of stars ($\sim$0.02 dex), while
significant abundance variations ($\sim$0.05 -- 0.20 dex) are found across the

Unknown Systematics, which deals in a conservative way with the problem of data
combination, for any degree of tension between experiments. We introduce
hyperparameters that describe a bias in each model parameter for each class of
experiments. A conservative posterior for the model parameters is then obtained
by marginalization both over these unknown shifts and over the width of their
prior. We contrast this approach with an existing hyperparameter method in
which each individual likelihood is scaled, comparing the performance of each
approach and their combination in application to some idealized models. Using
only these rescaling hyperparameters is not a suitable approach for the current
observational situation, in which internal null tests of the errors are passed,
and yet different experiments prefer models that are in poor agreement. The
possible existence of large shift systematics cannot be constrained with a
small number of data sets, leading to extended tails on the conservative
posterior distributions. We illustrate our method with the case of the $H_0$

symmetries of an intrinsically determined physical system under which
observables remain unaffected, but the extraneous information is changed. We
establish three central results in this context: i) Given a system with such a
symmetry there exists a system of invariants which form a subalgebra of phase
space, whose evolution is autonomous; ii) this subalgebra of autonomous
observables evolves as a contact system, in which the friction-like term
describes evolution along the direction of similarity; iii) the contact
Hamiltonian and one-form are invariants, and reproduce the dynamics of the
invariants. As the subalgebra of invariants is smaller than phase space,
dynamics is determined only in terms of this smaller space. We show how to
obtain the contact system from the symplectic system, and the embedding which
inverts the process. These results are then illustrated in the case of
homogeneous Lagrangians, including flat cosmologies minimally coupled to
matter; the n-body problem and homogeneous, anisotropic cosmology.

Commissioning observations of calibrator radio sources show that this receiver
has the lowest reported beamformed system temperature ($T_{\rm sys}$)
normalized by aperture efficiency ($\eta$) of any phased array receiver to
date. The measured $T_{\rm sys}/\eta$ is $25.4 \pm 2.5$ K near 1350 MHz for the
boresight beam, which is comparable to the performance of the current 1.4 GHz
cryogenic single feed receiver on the GBT. The degradation in $T_{\rm
sys}/\eta$ at $\sim$ 4 arcmin (required for Nyquist sampling) and $\sim$ 8
arcmin offsets from the boresight is, respectively, $\sim$ 1\% and $\sim$ 20\%
of the boresight value. The survey speed of the PAF with seven formed beams is
larger by a factor between 2.1 and 7 compared to a single beam system depending
on the observing application. The measured performance, both in frequency and
offset from boresight, qualitatively agree with predictions from a rigorous
electromagnetic model of the PAF. The astronomical utility of the receiver is
demonstrated by observations of the pulsar B0329+54 and an extended HII region,
the Rosette Nebula. The enhanced survey speed with the new PAF receiver will
enable the GBT to carry out exciting new science, such as more efficient
observations of diffuse, extended neutral hydrogen emission from galactic

vectors into visually plausible images. If the real dataset contains only clean

clean images. In this paper, we propose to denoise corrupted images by finding
the nearest point on the GAN manifold, recovering latent vectors by minimizing
distances in image space. We first demonstrate that given a corrupted version
of an image that truly lies on the GAN manifold, we can approximately recover
the latent vector and denoise the image, obtaining significantly higher
quality, comparing with BM3D. Next, we demonstrate that latent vectors
recovered from noisy images exhibit a consistent bias. By subtracting this bias
before projecting back to image space, we improve denoising results even
further. Finally, even for unseen images, our method performs better at
denoising better than BM3D. Notably, the basic version of our method (without
bias correction) requires no prior knowledge on the noise variance. To achieve
the highest possible denoising quality, the best performing signal processing

paper is to show that the subjective choice of data and analysis methodology
substantially impacts the identification of factors and outcomes of
observational studies. This subjective variability of inference is at the heart
of recent discussions around irreproducibility in scientific research. To
demonstrate this subjective variability, data is taken from an existing study,
where interest centres on understanding the factors associated with a young
adult's propensity to fall into the category of `not in employment, education

Bayesian framework and implemented using Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte

inference problematic. We demonstrate how the use of prior distributions in

electron pair produced at midrapidity with mass larger than 110 GeV, has been
observed for the first time at the LHC in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV.
One of the two scattered protons is measured in the CMS-TOTEM precision proton
spectrometer (CT-PPS), which operated for the first time in 2016. The second
proton either remains intact or is excited and then dissociates into a low-mass
state p$^{*}$, which is undetected. The measurement is based on an integrated
luminosity of 9.4 fb$^{-1}$ collected during standard, high-luminosity LHC
operation. A total of 12 $\mu^+\mu^-$ and 8 e$^+$e$^-$ pairs with
$m(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}) >$ 110 GeV, and matching forward proton kinematics, are
observed, with expected backgrounds of 1.49 $\pm$ 0.07 (stat) $\pm$ 0.53 (syst)
and 2.36 $\pm$ 0.09 (stat) $\pm$ 0.47 (syst), respectively. This corresponds to
an excess of more than five standard deviations over the expected background.
The present result constitutes the first observation of proton-tagged
$\gamma\gamma$ collisions at the electroweak scale. This measurement also
demonstrates that CT-PPS performs according to the design specifications.

involved in many physiological functions, including analgesia, hypothermia, and
hypotension. To gain a better understanding of which signaling pathways or
combination of pathways are linked to NTS1 activation and function, we
investigated the ability of activated hNTS1, which was stably expressed by
CHO-K1 cells, to directly engage G proteins, activate second messenger cascades
and recruit \b{eta}-arrestins. Using BRET-based biosensors, we found that
neurotensin (NT), NT(8-13) and neuromedin N (NN) activated the G{\alpha}q-,
G{\alpha}i1-, G{\alpha}oA-, and G{\alpha}13-protein signaling pathways as well
as the recruitment of \b{eta}-arrestins 1 and 2. Using pharmacological
inhibitors, we further demonstrated that all three ligands stimulated the
production of inositol phosphate and modulation of cAMP accumulation along with
ERK1/2 activation. Interestingly, despite the functional coupling to
G{\alpha}i1 and G{\alpha}oA, NT was found to produce higher levels of cAMP in
the presence of pertussis toxin, supporting that hNTS1 activation leads to cAMP
accumulation in a G{\alpha}s-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrated
that the full activation of ERK1/2 required signaling through both a
PTX-sensitive Gi/o-c-Src signaling pathway and PLCb-DAG-PKC-Raf-1- dependent
pathway downstream of Gq. Finally, the whole-cell integrated signatures
monitored by the cell-based surface plasmon resonance and changes in the
electrical impedance of a confluent cell monolayer led to identical phenotypic
responses between the three ligands. The characterization of the hNTS1-mediated
cellular signaling network will be helpful to accelerate the validation of
potential NTS1 biased ligands with an improved therapeutic/adverse effect
profile.

humans whilst reducing peripheral vascular resistance. In this study, we
investigated the signaling pathways through which apelin exerts its hypotensive
action. We synthesized a series of apelin-13 analogs whereby the C-terminal
Phe13 residue was replaced by natural or unnatural amino acids. In HEK293 cells
expressing APJ, we evaluated the relative efficacy of these compounds to
activate G{\alpha}i1 and G{\alpha}oA G-proteins, recruit \b{eta}-arrestins 1

ratio for each pathway allowed us to identify several analogs with distinct
signaling profiles. Furthermore, we found that these analogs delivered i.v. to
Sprague-Dawley rats exerted a wide range of hypotensive responses. Indeed, two
compounds lost their ability to lower blood pressure, while other analogs
significantly reduced blood pressure as apelin-13. Interestingly, analogs that
did not lower blood pressure were less effective at recruiting \b{eta}arrs.
Finally, using Spearman correlations, we established that the hypotensive
response was significantly correlated with \b{eta}arr recruitment but not with

the \b{eta}arr recruitment potency is involved in the hypotensive efficacy of

generally to suppress flavor transformation, while the flavor-violating (FV)

explore the actual level of circular polarization in the CMB generated by
conventional cosmological sources of birefringence. We consider two classes of
mechanisms for birefringence. One is alignment of the matter to produce an
anisotropic susceptibility tensor: the hydrogen spins can be aligned either by
density perturbations or CMB anisotropies themselves. The other is anisotropy
of the radiation field coupled to the non-linear response of the medium to
electromagnetic fields: this can occur either via photon-photon scattering
(non-linear response of the vacuum); atomic hyperpolarizability (non-linear
response of neutral atoms); or plasma delay (non-linear response of free
electrons). The strongest effect comes from photon-photon scattering from
recombination at a level of $\sim 10^{-14}$ K. Our results are consistent with
a negligible circular polarization of the CMB in comparison with the linear
polarization or the sensitivity of current and near-term experiments.

need to know the topology and line impedances of their electric networks.
Nevertheless, distribution grids currently lack a comprehensive metering

they have been recently advocated as the means for an active data acquisition
paradigm: Reading the voltage deviations induced by intentionally perturbing
inverter injections, the system operator can potentially recover the electric
grid topology. Adopting inverter probing for feeder processing, a suite of
graph-based topology identification algorithms is developed here. If the grid
is probed at all leaf nodes but voltage data are metered at all nodes, the
entire feeder topology can be successfully recovered. When voltage data are
collected only at probing buses, the operator can find a reduced feeder
featuring key properties and similarities to the actual feeder. To handle
modeling inaccuracies and load non-stationarity, noisy probing data need to be
preprocessed. If the suggested guidelines on the magnitude and duration of
probing are followed, the recoverability guarantees carry over from the
noiseless to the noisy setup with high probability.

the feasibility and efficiency of approximate consensus under different
restrictions on topology knowledge and the relay depth, i.e., the maximum
number of hops any message can be relayed. These two constraints are common in
large-scale networks, and are used to avoid memory overload and network
congestion respectively. Specifically, for different values of integers k, k ,
we consider that each node knows all its neighbors of at most k-hop distance
(k-hop topology knowledge), and the relay depth is k . We consider both
directed and undirected graphs. More concretely, we answer the following main
question in asynchronous systems:
  What is a tight condition on the underlying communication graphs for
achieving approximate consensus if each node has only a k-hop topology
knowledge and relay depth k?
  To prove that the necessary conditions presented in the paper are also
sufficient, we have developed algorithms that achieve consensus in graphs
satisfying those conditions:
  -The first class of algorithms requires k-hop topology knowledge and relay
depth k. Unlike prior algorithms, these algorithms do not flood the network,
and each node does not need the full topology knowledge. We show how the
convergence time and the message complexity of those algorithms is affected by
k, providing the respective upper bounds.
  -The second set of algorithms requires only one-hop neighborhood knowledge,
i.e., immediate incoming and outgoing neighbors, but needs to flood the network
(i.e., relay depth is n, where n is the number of nodes). One result that may
be of independent interest is a topology discovery mechanism to learn and

physically and chemically, to understand the environment in which planets form.
However, the first steps of planet formation are likely to occur already when
the protostar and disk are still embedded in their natal envelope. The initial
conditions for planet formation may thus be provided by these young embedded
disks, of which the physical and chemical structure is poorly characterized. We
aim to constrain the midplane temperature structure, one of the critical
unknowns, of the embedded disk around L1527. In particular, we set out to
determine whether there is an extended cold outer region where CO is frozen
out, as is the case for Class II disks. We use archival ALMA data to directly
observe the midplane of the near edge-on L1527 disk. Optically thick $^{13}$CO
($J=2-1$) and C$^{18}$O ($J=2-1$) emission is observed throughout the disk and
inner envelope, while N$_2$D$^+ (J=3-2$), which can only be abundant when CO is
frozen out, is not detected. Both CO isotopologues have brightness temperatures
$\gtrsim$ 25 K along the midplane. Disk and envelope emission can be
disentangled kinematically, because the largest velocities are reached in the
disk. A power law radial temperature profile constructed using the highest
midplane temperature at these velocities suggest that the temperature is above
20 K out to at least 75 AU, and possibly throughout the entire 125 AU disk.
Radiative transfer models show that a model without CO freeze-out in the disk
matches the C$^{18}$O observations better than a model with the CO snowline at
$\sim$70 AU. In addition, there is no evidence for a large (order of magnitude)
depletion of CO. The disk around L1527 is likely to be warm enough to have CO

ideally suited for real-time motion analysis. The unique properties encompassed
in the readings of such sensors provide high temporal resolution, superior
sensitivity to light and low latency. These properties provide the grounds to
estimate motion extremely reliably in the most sophisticated scenarios but they
come at a price - modern event-based vision sensors have extremely low

event stream calls for novel algorithms.
  This paper presents a new, efficient approach to object tracking with
asynchronous cameras. We present a novel event stream representation which
enables us to utilize information about the dynamic (temporal) component of the
event stream, and not only the spatial component, at every moment of time. This
is done by approximating the 3D geometry of the event stream with a parametric
model; as a result, the algorithm is capable of producing the
motion-compensated event stream (effectively approximating egomotion), and
without using any form of external sensors in extremely low-light and noisy
conditions without any form of feature tracking or explicit optical flow
computation. We demonstrate our framework on the task of independent motion
detection and tracking, where we use the temporal model inconsistencies to
locate differently moving objects in challenging situations of very fast

four years. Long-cadence data with 29.4 min sampling were obtained for ~200,000
individual stellar targets in at least one observing quarter in the primary
Kepler Mission. Light curves for target stars are extracted in the Kepler
Science Data Processing Pipeline, and are searched for transiting planet
signatures. A Threshold Crossing Event is generated in the transit search for
targets where the transit detection threshold is exceeded and transit
consistency checks are satisfied. These targets are subjected to further
scrutiny in the Data Validation (DV) component of the Pipeline. Transiting
planet candidates are characterized in DV, and light curves are searched for
additional planets after transit signatures are modeled and removed. A suite of
diagnostic tests is performed on all candidates to aid in discrimination
between genuine transiting planets and instrumental or astrophysical false
positives. Data products are generated per target and planet candidate to
document and display transiting planet model fit and diagnostic test results.
These products are exported to the Exoplanet Archive at the NASA Exoplanet
Science Institute, and are available to the community. We describe the DV
architecture and diagnostic tests, and provide a brief overview of the data
products. Transiting planet modeling and the search for multiple planets on

plateau M/Ms = 5/6 for this model. Besides, we examine the magnetic

in the literature as ""holomorphic chains"" --- have practical use in questions
concerning the topology of the moduli space of Higgs bundles. In that problem,
the variety is a Riemann surface of genus at least 2, and the twist is its

Higgs bundles and computing their deformation theory. We then focus in

$M_\phi \sim 5-10$~keV and $g_s \sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, as allowed by

neutrinos with relic sterile neutrinos on their way to the Earth would result
in significant dips in the neutrino spectrum which would produce unique
features in the event spectra observed in these detectors.

the brightest spot is facing the observer, suggesting a correlation between the
position of the bright spots and flare events. In addition, these flares may
occur preferentially when the spots are increasing in brightness, which
suggests that the 3.3 d periodicity may not be a rotational signal, but rather
a characteristic timescale of active regions.

general bipartite stochastic block model (SBM). A modern spectral clustering
algorithm consists of three steps: (1) regularization of an appropriate
adjacency or Laplacian matrix (2) a form of spectral truncation and (3) a
k-means type algorithm in the reduced spectral domain. We focus on the
adjacency-based spectral clustering and for the first step, propose a new
data-driven regularization that can restore the concentration of the adjacency
matrix even for the sparse networks. This result is based on recent work on
regularization of random binary matrices, but avoids using unknown population
level parameters, and instead estimates the necessary quantities from the data.
We also propose and study a novel variation of the spectral truncation step and
show how this variation changes the nature of the misclassification rate in a
general SBM. We then show how the consistency results can be extended to models
beyond SBMs, such as inhomogeneous random graph models with approximate
clusters, including a graphon clustering problem, as well as general
sub-Gaussian biclustering. A theme of the paper is providing a better
understanding of the analysis of spectral methods for community detection and
establishing consistency results, under fairly general clustering models and
for a wide regime of degree growths, including sparse cases where the average
expected degree grows arbitrarily slowly.

objection. Digital computers can indeed surprise us. Just like a piece of art,
algorithms can be designed in such a way as to lead us to question our
understanding of the world, or our place within it. Some humans do lose the
capacity to be surprised in that way. It might be fear, or it might be the
comfort of ideological certainties. As lazy normative animals, we do need to be
able to rely on authorities to simplify our reasoning: that is ok. Yet the
growing sophistication of systems designed to free us from the constraints of
normative engagement may take us past a point of no-return. What if, through
lack of normative exercise, our moral muscles became so atrophied as to leave
us unable to question our social practices? This paper makes two distinct
normative claims:
  1. Decision-support systems should be designed with a view to regularly
jolting us out of our moral torpor.
  2. Without the depth of habit to somatically anchor model certainty, a
computer s experience of something new is very different from that which in
humans gives rise to non-trivial surprises. This asymmetry has key
repercussions when it comes to the shape of ethical agency in artificial moral
agents. The worry is not just that they would be likely to leap morally ahead
of us, unencumbered by habits. The main reason to doubt that the moral
trajectories of humans v. autonomous systems might remain compatible stems from
the asymmetry in the mechanisms underlying moral change. Whereas in humans
surprises will continue to play an important role in waking us to the need for
moral change, cognitive processes will rule when it comes to machines. This
asymmetry will translate into increasingly different moral outlooks, to the
point of likely unintelligibility. The latter prospect is enough to doubt the
desirability of autonomous moral agents.

that the circumference of the ring $L$ can be stabilised once the previously

vortex is not BPS but its energy becomes close to the BPS bound if $L$ is

BPS-saturated solitons. BPS saturation is achieved in the limit $J\rightarrow

WLLN introduced in this paper shows that the same is essentially true for
signals supported on graphs. However, the notions of stationarity, ensemble

stationary signals as those that satisfy a form of invariance with respect to

here as an average of successive weighted averages of local signal values with

node-varying signals are within e of each other with probability of order
O(1/Ne^2) in at least some nodes. In stationary time signals, the realization
average is not only a consistent estimator of the ensemble mean but also
optimal in terms of mean squared error (MSE). This is not true of graph

sensor outputs can provide improved results. However, if some of the sensors
are providing lower quality outputs, the fused results can be degraded. In this
work, a multi-sensor conflict measure is proposed which estimates multi-sensor
conflict by representing each sensor output as interval-valued information and
examines the sensor output overlaps on all possible n-tuple sensor
combinations. The conflict is based on the sizes of the intervals and how many
sensors output values lie in these intervals. In this work, conflict is defined
in terms of how little the output from multiple sensors overlap. That is, high
degrees of overlap mean low sensor conflict, while low degrees of overlap mean
high conflict. This work is a preliminary step towards a robust conflict and
sensor fusion framework. In addition, a sensor fusion algorithm is proposed
based on a weighted sum of sensor outputs, where the weights for each sensor
diminish as the conflict measure increases. The proposed methods can be
utilized to (1) assess a measure of multi-sensor conflict, and (2) improve
sensor output fusion by lessening weighting for sensors with high conflict.
Using this measure, a simulated example is given to explain the mechanics of
calculating the conflict measure, and stereo camera 3D outputs are analyzed and
fused. In the stereo camera case, the sensor output is corrupted by additive
impulse noise, DC offset, and Gaussian noise. Impulse noise is common in
sensors due to intermittent interference, a DC offset a sensor bias or
registration error, and Gaussian noise represents a sensor output with low SNR.
The results show that sensor output fusion based on the conflict measure shows
improved accuracy over a simple averaging fusion strategy.

Based on our previous work on forcing theory, this new criterion is purely
topological and can be expressed in terms of equivariant Brouwer foliations and
transverse trajectories. We then apply this new tool in the study of the
dynamics of homeomorphisms of surfaces with zero genus and null topological
entropy and we obtain several applications. For homeomorphisms of the open
annulus $\mathbb{A}$ with zero topological entropy, we show that rotation
numbers exists for all points with nonempty omega limits, and that if
$\mathbb{A}$ is a generalized region of instability then it admits a single
rotation vector. We also offer a new proof of a recent result of Passegi,
Potrie and Sambarino, showing that zero entropy dissipative homeomorphisms of
the annulus having as an atractor a circloid have a single rotation number.
  Our work also studies homeomorphisms of the sphere without horseshoes. For
these maps we present a structure theorem in terms of fixed point free
invariant sub-annuli, as well as a very restricted description of all possible
dynamical behavior in the transitive subsets. This description ensures, for
instance, that transitive sets can contain at most $2$ distinct periodic orbits

set must be an extension of an odometer. In particular, we show that any

  Models",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Additive regression models are actively researched in the statistical field
because of their usefulness in the analysis of responses determined by
non-linear relationships with multivariate predictors. In this kind of
statistical models, the response depends linearly on unknown functions of
predictor variables and typically, the goal of the analysis is to make
inference about these functions.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of Additive Regression with random
designs from a novel viewpoint: we propose an estimator based on an orthogonal
projection onto a multiresolution space using empirical wavelet coefficients
that are fully data driven. In this setting, we derive a mean-square consistent
estimator based on periodic wavelets on the interval $[0,1]$. For construction
of the estimator, we assume that the joint distribution of predictors is
non-zero and bounded on its support; We also assume that the functions belong
to a Sobolev space and integrate to zero over the $[0,1]$ interval, which
guarantees model identifiability and convergence of the proposed method.
Moreover, we provide the $\mathbb{L}_{2}$ risk analysis of the estimator and
derive its convergence rate.
  Theoretically, we show that this approach achieves good convergence rates
when the dimensionality of the problem is relatively low and the set of unknown
functions is sufficiently smooth. In this approach, the results are obtained
without the assumption of an equispaced design, a condition that is typically
assumed in most wavelet-based procedures.
  Finally, we show practical results obtained from simulated data,
demonstrating the potential applicability of our method in the problem of
additive regression models with random designs.

oscillation of the optical beam transmitted through a dielectric block and
whose orthogonal components are then mixed by a polarizer. We show under which
conditions the plane wave analysis is valid and when the power oscillation can
be optimized to reproduce a full pattern of oscillation and to simulate quarter
and half wave plates.

galaxy candidate Cetus II with the aim of providing stronger constraints on its
size, luminosity and stellar population. Cetus II is an important object in the
size-luminosity plane as it occupies the transition zone between dwarf galaxies
and star clusters. All known objects smaller than Cetus II ($r_h \sim 20$ pc)
are reported to be star clusters, while most larger objects are likely dwarf
galaxies. We found a prominent excess of main-sequence stars in the
colour-magnitude diagram of Cetus II, best described by a single stellar
population with an age of 11.2 Gyr, metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-1.28$ dex, an
[$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.0 dex at a heliocentric distance of 26.3$\pm$1.2 kpc. As well
as being spatially located within the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream, these
properties are well matched to the Sagittarius galaxy's Population B stars.
Interestingly, like our recent findings on the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy
candidate Tucana V, the stellar field in the direction of Cetus II shows no
evidence of a concentrated overdensity despite tracing the main sequence for
over six magnitudes. These results strongly support the picture that Cetus II
is not an ultra-faint stellar system in the Milky Way halo, but made up of
stars from the Sagittarius tidal stream.

addition, most methods fail to explicitly incorporate the spatial information

hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus

this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN),

analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation,
discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude

tensor dimensions vary across one of the modes. An example scenario is modeling
treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical
encounters over time. Despite recent improvements on unconstrained PARAFAC2,
its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it
PA}RAFAC2 (COPA) method, which carefully incorporates optimization constraints
such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid
optimization framework using alternating optimization and alternating direction
method of multiplier (AO-ADMM). As evaluated on large electronic health record
(EHR) datasets with hundreds of thousands of patients, COPA achieves
significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches
that only attempt to handle a subset of the constraints that COPA enables.
Overall, our method outperforms all the baselines attempting to handle a subset
of the constraints in terms of speed, while achieving the same level of
accuracy. Through a case study on temporal phenotyping of medically complex
children, we demonstrate how the constraints imposed by COPA reveal concise
phenotypes and meaningful temporal profiles of patients. The clinical
interpretation of both the phenotypes and the temporal profiles was confirmed

classical simulation of the system is intractable. A nuclear magnetic resonance
spin-ensemble system is one of the realistic candidates for such physical
implementations, which is currently available in laboratories. In this paper,
considering these realistic experimental constraints for implementing the
framework, we introduce a scheme, which we call a spatial multiplexing
technique, to effectively boost the computational power of the platform. This
technique exploits disjoint dynamics, which originate from multiple different
quantum systems driven by common input streams in parallel. Accordingly, unlike
designing a single large quantum system to increase the number of qubits for
computational nodes, it is possible to prepare a huge number of qubits from
multiple but small quantum systems, which are operationally easy to handle in
laboratory experiments. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of the
technique using several benchmark tasks and quantitatively investigate its

the tree edges into fewest number of feasible sets, where constraints on the
edges define feasibility. The motivation comes from wireless networking, where
we seek to model the irregularities seen in actual wireless environments. Not
all node pairs may be able to communicate, even if geographically close ---
thus, the available pairs are modeled with a link graph $\mathcal{L}=(V,E)$.
Also, signal attenuation need not follow a nice geometric formulas --- hence,
interference is modeled by a conflict (hyper)graph $\mathcal{C}=(E,F)$ on the
links. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of the communication, or
equivalently minimizing the length of a schedule of the tree edges in the form
of a coloring.
  We find that in spite of all this generality, the problem can be approximated
linearly in terms of a versatile parameter, the inductive independence of the
interference graph. Specifically, we give a simple algorithm that attains a
$O(\rho \log n)$-approximation, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\rho$ is
the inductive independence, and show that near-linear dependence on $\rho$ is
also necessary. We also treat an extension to Steiner trees, modeling
multicasting, and obtain a comparable result.

given hypercuboidally-shaped data that displays strong discontinuities,
rendering learning challenging. We model the sought high-dimensional function,
with a tensor-variate Gaussian Process (GP), and use three independent ways for
learning covariance matrices of the resulting likelihood, which is
Tensor-Normal. We demonstrate that the discontinuous data demands that
implemented covariance kernels be non-stationary--achieved by modelling each
kernel hyperparameter, as a function of the sample function of the invoked
tensor-variate GP. Each such function can be shown to be temporally-evolving,
and treated as a realisation from a distinct scalar-variate GP, with covariance
described adaptively by collating information from a historical set of samples
of chosen sample-size. We prove that deep-learning using 2-""layers"", suffice,
where the outer-layer comprises the tensor-variate GP, compounded with multiple
scalar-variate GPs in the ""inner-layer"", and undertake inference with
Metropolis-within-Gibbs. We apply our method to a cuboidally-shaped,
discontinuous, real dataset, and subsequently perform forward prediction to
generate data from our model, given our results--to perform model-checking.

no information regarding the operating condition after a foreseen contingency.
The proposed approach first estimates the post-contingency operating point as
well as possible PV-PQ transitions based on the current operating point. Then
the STI for each contingency can be predicted using the estimated operating
condition. Numerical results based on IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the
accuracy of the proposed approach in predicting the voltage stability margin
under contingency. Moreover, the on-line implementation of the proposed
approach is promising since it only involves solving several linear equations.

(RPE) Theorem, a result which appears in literature in the context of
Simultaneous Long-Short stock trading. This theorem states that using a
combination of two specially-constructed linear feedback trading controllers,
one long and one short, the expected value of the resulting gain-loss function
is guaranteed to be robustly positive with respect to a large class of
stochastic processes for the stock price. The main result of this paper is a
generalization of this theorem. Whereas previous work applies to a single
stock, in this paper, we consider a pair of stocks. To this end, we make two
assumptions on their expected returns. The first assumption involves price
correlation between the two stocks and the second involves a bounded non-zero
momentum condition. With known uncertainty bounds on the parameters associated
with these assumptions, our new version of the RPE Theorem provides necessary
and sufficient conditions on the positive feedback parameter K of the
controller under which robust positive expectation is assured. We also
demonstrate that our result generalizes the one existing for the single-stock
case. Finally, it is noted that our results also can be interpreted in the
context of pairs trading.

with significant consequences in material design and applications. In this
respect two intertwined aspects are important: stability and reversibility. It
is crucial to understand on the one hand how a glass may become unstable due to
increased plasticity under shear deformations; on the other hand, to what
extent the response is reversible, meaning how much a system is able to recover
the original configuration once the perturbation is released. Here we focus on
assemblies of hard spheres as the simplest model of amorphous solids such as
colloidal glasses and granular matter. We prepare glass states quenched from
equilibrium supercooled liquid states, which are obtained by using the swap
Monte Carlo algorithm and correspond to a wide range of structural relaxation
time scales. We exhaustively map out their stability and reversibility under
volume and shear strains, using extensive numerical simulations. The region on
the volume-shear strain phase diagram where the original glass state remains
solid is bounded by the shear-yielding and the shear-jamming lines which meet
at a yielding-jamming crossover point. This solid phase can be further divided
into two sub-phases: the stable glass phase where the system deforms purely
elastically and is totally reversible, and the marginal glass phase where it
experiences stochastic plastic deformations at mesoscopic scales and is
partially irreversible. The details of the stability-reversibility map depend
strongly on the quality of annealing of the glass. This study provides a
unified framework for understanding elasticity, plasticity, yielding and
jamming in amorphous solids.

  two-phase flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speed of sound is a key parameter for the compressibility effects in
multiphase flow. We present a new approach to do direct numerical simulations
on the speed of sound in compressible two-phase flow, based on the stratified
multiphase flow model (Chang & Liou, JCP 2007). In this method, each face is
divided into gas-gas, gas-liquid, and liquid-liquid parts via reconstruction of
volume fraction, and the corresponding fluxes are calculated by Riemann
solvers. Viscosity and heat transfer models are included. The effects of
frequency (below the natural frequency of bubbles), volume fraction, viscosity
and heat transfer are investigated. With frequency 1 kHz, under viscous and
isothermal conditions, the simulation results satisfy the experimental ones
very well. The simulation results show that the speed of sound in air-water
bubbly two-phase flow is larger when the frequency is higher. At lower
frequency, for the phasic velocities, the homogeneous condition is better
satisfied. Considering the phasic temperatures, during the wave propagation an
isothermal bubble behavior is observed. Finally, the dispersion relation of
acoustics in two-phase flow is compared with analytical results below the
natural frequency. This work for the first time presents an approach to the
direct numerical simulations of speed of sound and other compressibility
effects in multiphase flow, which can be applied to study more complex
situations, especially when it is hard to do experimental study.

characterizing the process of measurement. Predictions in quantum mechanics are
made from probabilities for sets of alternative histories. Probabilities can be
assigned only to sets of histories that approximately decohere. Decoherence is
defined and the mechanism of decoherence is reviewed. Decoherence requires a
sufficiently coarse-grained description of alternative histories of the
universe. A quasiclassical domain consists of a branching set of alternative
decohering histories, described by a coarse graining that is maximally refined
consistent with decoherence, with individual branches that exhibit a high level
of classical correlation in time. A quasiclassical domain is emergent in the
universe as a consequence of the initial condition and the action function of
the elementary particles. It is an important question whether all the
quasiclassical domains are roughly equivalent or whether there are various
essentially inequivalent ones. A measurement is a correlation with variables in
a quasiclassical domain. An observer (or information gathering and utilizing
system) is a complex adaptive system that has evolved to exploit the relative
predictability of a quasiclassical domain. We suggest that resolution of many
of the problems of interpretation presented by quantum mechanics is to be
accomplished, not by further scrutiny of the subject as it applies to
reproducible laboratory situations, but rather by an examination of alternative
histories of the universe, stemming from its initial condition, and a study of
the problem of quasiclassical domains.

usage of the image quality metrics in the video coding and more specific in the
motion estimation. We have utilized the perceptual image quality metrics
instead of MSE or SAD in the block based motion estimation. Three different
metrics have used: structural similarity or SSIM, complex wavelet structural

exhibit some degree of uncertainty in their results. Rather than treating this
as a problem, this paper asks if this uncertainty is a resource that can
simplify software quality prediction.
  For example, Deb's principle of $\epsilon$-dominance states that if there
exists some $\epsilon$ value below which it is useless or impossible to
distinguish results, then it is superfluous to explore anything less than
$\epsilon$. We say that for ""large $\epsilon$ problems"", the results space of
learning effectively contains just a few regions. If many learners are then
applied to such large $\epsilon$ problems, they would exhibit a ""many roads
lead to Rome"" property; i.e., many different software quality prediction
methods would generate a small set of very similar results.
  This paper explores DART, an algorithm especially selected to succeed for
large $\epsilon$ software quality prediction problems. DART is remarkable
simple yet, on experimentation, it dramatically out-performs three sets of
state-of-the-art defect prediction methods.
  The success of DART for defect prediction begs the questions: how many other
domains in software quality predictors can also be radically simplified? This
will be a fruitful direction for future work.

Bohr gave an address which is recognized as the first instance in which the
term ""complementarity"", as a physical concept, was spoken publicly [1],
revealing Bohr's own thinking about Louis de Broglie's ""duality"". Bohr had very
slowly accepted duality as a principle of physics: close observation of any
quantum object will reveal either wave-like or particle-like behavior, one or
the other of two fundamental and complementary features. Little disagreement
exists today about complementarity's importance and broad applicability in
quantum science. Book-length scholarly examinations even provide speculations
about the relevance of complementarity in fields as different from physics as
biology, psychology and social anthropology, connections which were apparently
of interest to Bohr himself (see Jammer [2], Murdoch [3] and Whitaker [4]).
Confusion evident in Como following his talk was not eliminated by Bohr's
article [1], and complementarity has been subjected to nine decades of repeated
examination ever since with no agreed resolution. Semi-popular treatments [5]
as well as expert examinations [6-9] show that the topic cannot be avoided, and
complementarity retains its central place in the interpretation of quantum
mechanics. However, recent approaches by our group [10-13] and others [14-20]
to the underlying notion of coherence now allow us to present a universal
formulation of complementarity that may signal the end to the confusion. We
demonstrate a new relationship that constrains the behavior of an
electromagnetic field (quantum or classical) in the fundamental context of
two-slit experiments. We show that entanglement is the ingredient needed to
complete Bohr's formulation of complementarity, debated for decades because of
its incompleteness.

spatial and temporal redundancies present in the video sequence, which is a
complex procedure. As a result almost all video encoders have five to ten times
more complexity than their decoders. In a video compression process, one of the
main tasks at the encoder side is motion estimation which is to extract the
temporal correlation between frames. Distributed video coding (DVC) proposed
the idea that can lead to low complexity encoders and higher complexity
decoders. DVC is a new paradigm in video compression based on the information
theoretic ideas of Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv theorems. Wyner-Ziv coding is
naturally robust against transmission errors and can be used for joint source
and channel coding. Side Information is one of the key components of the
Wyner-Ziv decoder. Better side information generation will result in better
functionality of Wyner-Ziv coder. In this paper we proposed a new method that
can generate side information with a better quality and thus better
compression. We have used HVS (human visual system) based image quality metrics
as our quality criterion. The motion estimation we used in the decoder is
modified due to these metrics such that we could obtain finer side information.
The motion compensation is optimized for perceptual quality metrics and leads
to better side information generation compared to con- ventional MSE (mean
squared error) or SAD (sum of absolute difference) based motion compensation
currently used in the literature. Better motion compensation means better
compression.

applications such as authentication of ownership or identification of illegal
copies. Digital watermark is an invisible or maybe visible structure added to
the original media (known as asset). Images are considered as communication
channel when they are subject to a watermark embedding procedure so in the case
of embedding a digital watermark in an image, the capacity of the channel
should be considered. There is a trade-off between imperceptibility, robustness
and capacity for embedding a watermark in an asset. In the case of image
watermarks, it is reasonable that the watermarking algorithm should depend on
the content and structure of the image. Conventionally, mean squared error
(MSE) has been used as a common distortion measure to assess the quality of the
images. Newly developed quality metrics proposed some distortion measures that
are based on human visual system (HVS). These metrics show that MSE is not
based on HVS and it has a lack of accuracy when dealing with perceptually
important signals such as images and videos. SSIM or structural similarity is a
state of the art HVS based image quality criterion that has recently been of
much interest. In this paper we propose a robust least significant bit (LSB)

is embedded into a host image through an adaptive algorithm. Various attacks
examined on the embedding approach and simulation results revealed the fact
that the watermarked sequence can be extracted with an acceptable accuracy

sensors to detect a car, instead uses real-time static images to consider a
group of slots together, instead of the usual single slot method. This greatly
decreases the expenses required to design an efficient parking system. We
compare the performance of our algorithm to that of other techniques. These

methodology to the stochastic combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB)
framework. We first analyze the standard TS algorithm for the general CMAB
model when the outcome distributions of all the base arms are independent, and
obtain a distribution-dependent regret bound of $O(m\log K_{\max}\log T /
\Delta_{\min})$, where $m$ is the number of base arms, $K_{\max}$ is the size
of the largest super arm, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\Delta_{\min}$ is the
minimum gap between the expected reward of the optimal solution and any
non-optimal solution. This regret upper bound is better than the $O(m(\log
K_{\max})^2\log T / \Delta_{\min})$ bound in prior works. Moreover, our novel
analysis techniques can help to tighten the regret bounds of other existing
UCB-based policies (e.g., ESCB), as we improve the method of counting the
cumulative regret. Then we consider the matroid bandit setting (a special class
of CMAB model), where we could remove the independence assumption across arms
and achieve a regret upper bound that matches the lower bound. Except for the
regret upper bounds, we also point out that one cannot directly replace the
exact offline oracle (which takes the parameters of an offline problem instance
as input and outputs the exact best action under this instance) with an
approximation oracle in TS algorithm for even the classical MAB problem.
Finally, we use some experiments to show the comparison between regrets of TS
and other existing algorithms, the experimental results show that TS
outperforms existing baselines.

the so-called filter regularized operator to design an approximate problem.
Different from recently developed approaches that consist in the conventional
spectral methods, we analyze this new approximation in a variational framework,
where the finite element method can be applied. To see the whole skeleton of
this method, our main results lie in the analysis of a semi-linear case and we
discuss some generalizations where this analysis can be adapted. As is
omnipresent in many physical processes, there is likely a myriad of models
derived from this simpler case, such as source localization problems for brain
tumors and heat conduction problems with nonlinear sinks in nuclear science.
With respect to each noise level, we benefit from the Faedo-Galerkin method to
study the weak solvability of the approximate problem. Relying on the
energy-like analysis, we provide detailed convergence rates in $L^2$-$H^1$ of
the proposed method when the true solution is sufficiently smooth. Depending on
the dimensions of the domain, we obtain an error estimate in $L^{r}$ for some

addressed successfully in the laboratory. However, we have identified the need
to continue these technology development efforts to achieve sub-microarcsecond
astrometry precision necessary for detection and characterization of Earth-like
planets around nearby FGK stars. The international community has realized the
importance of astrometry, and various astrometry missions have been proposed
and under development, with a few high profile missions now operational. We
believe that it is vital for the U.S. scientific community to participate in
the development of these new technologies and scientific discoveries. We
recommend exploring alternatives to incorporate astrometric capabilities into
future exoplanet flagship missions such as HABEX and LUVOIR, substantially
increasing the scientific return associated with the expected yield of
earth-like planets to be recovered.

demonstrate that these ligands have overall more effective interactions with
catalytically-essential residues and metal cofactors of EptA. Selected hits can

{\alpha}-In2Se3 layer as thin as 5 nm in the form of graphene/{\alpha}-In2Se3
heterojunction. The intrinsic out-of-plane ferroelectricity of the
{\alpha}-In2Se3 thin layers is evidenced by the observation of reversible
spontaneous electric polarization with a relative low coercive electric field
of ~$2 X 10^5 V/cm$ and a typical ferroelectric domain size of around tens
${\mu}m^2$. Owing to the out-of-plane ferroelectricity of the {\alpha}-In2Se3
layer, the Schottky barrier at the graphene/{\alpha}-In2Se3 interface can be
effectively tuned by switching the electric polarization with an applied
voltage, leading to a pronounced switchable double diode effect with an on/off
ratio of ~$10^4$. Our results offer a new way for developing novel
nanoelectronic devices based on 2D ferroelectrics.

Young tableaux with k rows (suggested in arXiv:1211.1273[hep-th]) by extracting
the second-class constraints, $\widehat{O}_\alpha=(\widehat{O}_a,

supercommute on the constraint surface with constrained BRST $Q_C$ and spin
operators $\sigma^i_C$. The closedness of the superalgebra $Q_C, \widehat{O}_a,
\sigma^i_C$ guarantees that the final gauge-invariant LF is compatible with
off-shell constraints $\widehat{O}_a$ imposed on field and gauge parameter
vectors of Hilbert space not depending from the ghosts and conversion auxiliary
oscillators related to $\widehat{O}_a$, in comparison with vectors for
unconstrained BRST-BFV LF. The suggested constrained BRST-BFV approach is valid
for both massive HS fields and integer HS fields in the second-order
formulation. It is shown that the respective constrained and unconstrained LFs
for (half)-integer HS fields with a given spin are equivalent. The constrained
Lagrangians in ghost-independent and component (for initial spin-tensor field)
are obtained and shown to coincide with Fang-Fronsdal formulation for
constrained totally-symmetric HS field. The triplet and unconstrained quartet

the victim's photo is acquired by the attacker. Again, the attack is totally
unobservable by nearby people, because not only the light is invisible, but

$\approx$$(1$-$5)\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to limits on the
rotational energy loss of a possible X-ray pulsar in SN 1987A of
$\approx$$(0.5$-$1.5)\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. However, a much brighter
X-ray source cannot be excluded if, as is likely, it is enshrouded in a cloud
of absorbing matter with metallicity similar to that expected in the outer
layers of a massive star towards the end of its life. We found that other
limits obtained from various arguments and observations in other energy ranges
either are unbinding or allow a similar maximum luminosity of the order of
$\approx$$10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We conclude that while a pulsar alike the one
in the Crab Nebula in both luminosity and spectrum is hardly compatible with
the observations, there is ample space for an `ordinary' X-ray-emitting young
neutron star, born with normal initial spin period, temperature and magnetic
field, to be hiding inside the evolving remnant of SN 1987A.

strain. The SW defect is intrinsic to the polymer-I structure of the
nanothreads and is a building block for the general hybrid structures. We find
that the bandgap of the nanothreads can be tuned by the concentration of SW
defects in a wide range of $3.92 \sim 4.82$ eV, interpolating between the
bandgaps of $sp^{3}$-(3,0) structure and the polymer-I structure. Under strain,
the bandgaps of all the structures, including the hybrid ones, show a
nonmonotonic variation: the bandgap first increases with strain, then drops at
large strain above 10%. The gap size can be effectively tuned by strain in a
wide range ($>0.5$ eV). Interestingly, for $sp^{3}$-(3,0) structure, a switch
of band ordering occurs under strain at the valence band maximum, and for the
polymer-I structure, an indirect-to-direct-bandgap transition occurs at about
8% strain. The result also indicates that the presence of SW defects tends to
stabilize the bandgap size against strain. Our findings suggest the great
potential of structure- and strain-engineered carbon nanothreads in
optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications as well as stress sensors.

occur with a rate that is the order of the effective Lyapunov exponent of the
classical chaotic system and imply that the wave packet undergoes random kicks
described by the classical Langevin equation of Brownian motion. The
implication of the analysis is that this theory can explain in detail how
classical mechanics arises from quantum mechanics by using only unitary
evolution and Born's Rule applied to a subsystem.

obtained in two steps. First, the ""current"" $ J = (k^2 - k_0^2)u$ is determined

via the current $ J (x) $ and the incident wave $u_0.$ The uniqueness of the

magnetic field concentrations during their rise through the convection zone to
produce complex active regions at the solar surface. To do so, we perform
numerical simulations of buoyant magnetic structures evolving and interacting
in a model solar convection zone. We first produce a 3D model of rotating
convection and then introduce idealized magnetic structures close to the bottom
of the computational domain. These structures possess a certain degree of field
line twist and they are made buoyant on a particular extension in longitude.
The resulting twisted $\Omega$-loops will thus evolve inside a spherical
convective shell possessing large-scale mean flows. We present results on the
interaction between two such loops with various initial parameters (mainly
buoyancy and twist) and on the complexity of the emerging magnetic field. In
agreement with analytical predictions, we find that if the loops are introduced
with opposite handedness and same axial field direction or same handedness but
opposite axial field, they bounce against each other. The emerging region is
then constituted of two separated bipolar structures. On the contrary, if the
loops are introduced with the same direction of axial and peripheral magnetic
fields and if sufficiently close, they merge while rising. This more
interesting case produces complex magnetic structures, with a high degree of
non-neutralized currents, especially when the convective motions act
significantly on the magnetic field. This indicates that those interactions
could be good candidates to produce eruptive events like flares or CMEs.

coupled-channels models, at energies below the lowest barrier between the
reaction partners, is termed as deep sub-barrier fusion hindrance. This
phenomenon has been observed in many symmetric and nearly-symmetric systems.
Different physical origins of the hindrance have been proposed. This work aims
to study the probable effects of direct reactions on deep sub-barrier fusion
cross sections. Fusion (evaporation residue) cross sections have been measured
for the system $^{19}$F+$^{181}$Ta, from above the barrier down to the energies
where fusion hindrance is expected to come into play. Coupled-channels
calculation with standard Woods-Saxon potential gives a fair description of the
fusion excitation function down to energies $\simeq 14\%$ below the barrier for
the present system. This is in contrast with the observation of increasing
fusion hindrance in asymmetric reactions induced by increasingly heavier
projectiles, \textit{viz.} $^{6,7}$Li, $^{11}$B, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O. The
asymmetric reactions, which have not shown any signature of fusion hindrance
within the measured energy range, are found to be induced by projectiles with
lower $\alpha$ break-up threshold, compared to the reactions which have shown
signatures of fusion hindrance. In addition, most of the $Q$-values for light
particles pick-up channels are negative for the reactions which have exhibited
strong signatures of fusion hindrance, \textit{viz.} $^{12}$C+$^{198}$Pt and
$^{16}$O+$^{204,208}$Pb. Thus, break-up of projectile and particle transfer
channels with positive $Q$-values seem to compensate for the hindrance in
fusion deep below the barrier. Inclusion of break-up and transfer channels
within the framework of coupled-channels calculation would be of interest.

high-quality storage cavity. However, such systems are bulky compared to their
less coherent 2D counterparts. A more compact and scalable approach is achieved
by making use of the multimode structure of a 3D cavity. In our work, we
investigate such a device where a transmon qubit is capacitively coupled to two
modes of a single 3D cavity. The external coupling is engineered so that the
memory mode has an about 100 times larger quality factor than the readout mode.
Using an all-microwave second-order protocol, we realize a lifetime enhancement
of the stored state over the qubit lifetime by a factor of $6$ with a fidelity
of approximately $80\%$ determined via quantum process tomography. We also find
that this enhancement is not limited by fundamental constraints.

otherwise unitary evolution of the system is interrupted by a non-unitary
projection operation. In order to probe measurement-induced effects in the
state dynamics using a quantum simulator, the challenge is to implement
controlled measurements on a small subspace of the system and continue the
evolution from the complementary subspace. A powerful platform for versatile
quantum evolution is represented by photonic quantum walks due to their high
control over all relevant parameters. However, measurement-induced dynamics in
such a platform have not yet been realized. Here we implement controlled
measurements in a discrete-time quantum walk based on time multiplexing. This
is achieved by adding a deterministic out-coupling of the optical signal to
include measurements constrained to specific positions resulting in the
projection of the walker's state on the remaining ones. With this platform and
coherent input light we experimentally simulate measurement-induced single
particle quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the difference between dynamics with
only a single measurement at the final step and those including measurements
during the evolution. To this aim we study recurrence as a figure of merit,
i.e. the return probability to the walker's starting position, which is
measured in the two cases. We track the development of the return probability
over 36 time steps and observe the onset of both recurrent and transient
evolution as an effect of the different measurement schemes, a signature which
only emerges for quantum systems. Our simulation of the observed one particle
conditional quantum dynamics does not require a genuine quantum particle but is
demonstrated with coherent light.

useful for software development tasks that need functionality implementations
in different languages. Although past studies have considered this problem,
they may be either specific to the language grammars, or specific to certain
kinds of code elements (e.g., tokens, phrases, API uses). This paper proposes a
new approach to automatically learn cross-language representations for various
kinds of structural code elements that may be used for program translation. Our
key idea is two folded: First, we normalize and enrich code token streams with
additional structural and semantic information, and train cross-language vector
representations for the tokens (a.k.a. shared embeddings based on word2vec, a
neural-network-based technique for producing word embeddings; Second,
hierarchically from bottom up, we construct shared embeddings for code elements
of higher levels of granularity (e.g., expressions, statements, methods) from
the embeddings for their constituents, and then build mappings among code
elements across languages based on similarities among embeddings.
  Our preliminary evaluations on about 40,000 Java and C# source files from 9
software projects show that our approach can automatically learn shared
embeddings for various code elements in different languages and identify their
cross-language mappings with reasonable Mean Average Precision scores. When
compared with an existing tool for mapping library API methods, our approach
identifies many more mappings accurately. The mapping results and code can be
accessed at
https://github.com/bdqnghi/hierarchical-programming-language-mapping. We
believe that our idea for learning cross-language vector representations with
code structural information can be a useful step towards automated program

Hence, galaxies behave as clocks, rotating once a Gyr at the very outskirts of
their discs. Observations of a large optically-selected sample are consistent,
implying this relationship is generic to disc galaxies in the low redshift
Universe. A linear RV relationship is expected from simple models of galaxy
formation and evolution. The total mass within Rmax has collapsed by a factor
of 37 compared to the present mean density of the Universe. Adopting standard
assumptions we find a mean halo spin parameter lambda in the range 0.020 to
0.035. The dispersion in lambda, 0.16 dex, is smaller than expected from
simulations. This may be due to the biases in our selection of disc galaxies
rather than all halos. The estimated mass densities of stars and atomic gas at
Rmax are similar (~0.5 Msun/pc^2) indicating outer discs are highly evolved.
The gas consumption and stellar population build time-scales are hundreds of
Gyr, hence star formation is not driving the current evolution of outer discs.
The estimated ratio between Rmax and disc scale length is consistent with
long-standing predictions from monolithic collapse models. Hence, it remains
unclear whether disc extent results from continual accretion, a rapid initial
collapse, secular evolution or a combination thereof.

proton-proton collisions in order to reduce the contamination from
non-perturbative effects, is applied to event shapes in electron-positron
annihilation. In particular, we study the thrust distribution at the $Z$ pole
and show that the region where non-perturbative corrections due to the
hadronisation process are small is considerably extended if soft drop is
applied. Therefore, we argue that the use of soft drop to reduce hadronisation
effects is potentially of great benefit in the context of strong coupling
determination using event shapes, which would be otherwise characterised by a
strong correlation between $\alpha_s$ and non-perturbative parameters. However,
reduced sensitivity to hadronisation corrections is only one of the aspects
that need to be considered. In this context, we show that perturbative
calculability, especially away from the soft and collinear region of the
event-shape spectrum, has a nontrivial interplay with the soft-drop observable
of choice. To this purpose, besides thrust, we investigate the behaviour of the
hemisphere mass as well as the jet mass. We find that the latter shows the most
promising behaviour in the intermediate region of the spectrum, especially if
small jet radii are considered.

gravity gradients, in spite of the fact that the experimenters were aware of it

a combination of double inverse J-shaped and inverse-S field-lines with dips
touching the photosphere. Such field-lines are formed by flux-cancellation

formation of a weakly twisted flux-rope from large scale sheared arcade field

until a CME is triggered. The modeled structure captured these major features
of sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid transformation, that is being recurrent under
continuous photospheric flux motions. Calculations of the field-line twist
reveal a fractional increase followed by a decrease of the number of pixels

direct analysis of concurrent changes in the recent period has been presented.
Here the observational TC record (1981-2016) and the ERA-Interim, JRA55 and
MERRA2 reanalyses are studied to examine potential relationships between the
two. A zonally-asymmetric HC is defined by employing Helmholtz theory for
vector decomposition and this permits the derivation of novel HC diagnostics
local to TC basins. Coherent variations in both long-term linear trends and
detrended interannual variability are found. TC genesis and lifetime maximum
intensity latitudes share trend sign and magnitude with shifts in local HC
extent, with rates being ~0.25 plus/minus 0.1 degrees latitude decade-1. Both
these lifecycle stages in hemispheric means and all Pacific TC basins, as well
as poleward-extreme North Atlantic lysis latitudes, shared ~35% of their
interannual variability with HC extent. Local HC intensity is linked only to
eastern North Pacific TC latitudes, where strong local overturning corresponds
to equatorward TC shifts. Examination of potential dynamical linkages
implicates La Ni\~na-like sea surface temperature gradients to poleward HC
termini. This corresponds to increased tropical and reduced subtropical
vertical wind shear everywhere except in the North Atlantic and western North
Pacific, where the opposite is true. These results quantify a long-hypothesized

GMCs occupy a distinct region in the PC1-PC2 plane, with lower ISM content and
star formation activity compared to intermediate age and older clouds.

that GMCs may be heated or grow denser and more massive via aggregation of
diffuse material in their first ~10 Myr. The PCA also objectively identified a

main processes playing a relevant role in the cosmic evolution of ETGs.
Specifically, their early fast evolution comprises: biased collapse of the low
angular momentum gaseous baryons located in the inner regions of the host dark
matter halo; cooling, fragmentation, and infall of the gas down to the radius
set by the centrifugal barrier; further rapid compaction via clump/gas
migration toward the galaxy center, where strong heavily dust-enshrouded
star-formation takes place and most of the stellar mass is accumulated;
ejection of substantial gas amount from the inner regions by feedback
processes, which causes a dramatic puffing up of the stellar component. In the
late slow evolution, passive aging of stellar populations and mass additions by
dry merger events occur. We describe these processes relying on prescriptions
inspired by basic physical arguments and by numerical simulations, to derive
new analytical estimates of the relevant sizes, timescales, and kinematic
properties for individual galaxies along their evolution. Then we obtain
quantitative results as a function of galaxy mass and redshift, and compare
them to recent observational constraints on half-light size $R_e$, on the ratio
$v/\sigma$ between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion (for gas and
stars) and on the specific angular momentum $j_\star$ of the stellar component;
we find good consistency with the available multi-band data in average values
and dispersion, both for local ETGs and for their $z\sim 1-2$ star-forming and
quiescent progenitors.

  procedure with a statistical criterion",,,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent remarkable advances in the experimental techniques have provided a
background for inferring neuronal couplings from point process data that
includes a great number of neurons. Here, we propose a systematic procedure for
pre- and post-processing generic point process data in an objective manner, to
handle data in the framework of a binary simple statistical model, the Ising or
generalized McCulloch--Pitts model. The procedure involves two steps: (1)
determining time-bin size for transforming the point-process data into
discrete-time binary data and (2) screening relevant couplings from the
estimated couplings. For the first step, we decide the optimal time-bin size by
introducing the null hypothesis that all neurons would fire independently, then
choosing a time-bin size so that the null hypothesis is rejected with the most
strict criterion. The likelihood associated with the null hypothesis is
analytically evaluated and used for the rejection process. For the second
post-processing step, after a certain estimator of coupling is obtained based
on the pre-processed dataset, the estimate is compared with many other
estimates derived from datasets obtained by randomizing the original dataset in
the time direction. We accept the original estimate as relevant only if its
absolute value is sufficiently larger than them of randomized datasets. These
manipulations suppress false positive couplings induced by statistical noise.
We apply this inference procedure to spiking data from synthetic and in vitro
neuronal networks. The results show that the proposed procedure identifies the
presence/absence of synaptic couplings fairly well including their signs, for
the synthetic and experimental data. In particular, the results support that we
can infer the physical connections of underlying systems in favorable
situations, even when using the simple statistical model.

  with parametric links via reparameterized importance sampling",,"Spatial Statistics, 2019",,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) are popular for analyzing
non-Gaussian spatial data. These models assume a prescribed link function that
relates the underlying spatial field with the mean response. There are
circumstances, such as when the data contain outlying observations, where the
use of a prescribed link function can result in poor fit, which can be improved
by using a parametric link function. Some popular link functions, such as the
Box-Cox, are unsuitable because they are inconsistent with the Gaussian
assumption of the spatial field. We present sensible choices of parametric link
functions which possess desirable properties. It is important to estimate the
parameters of the link function, rather than assume a known value. To that end,
we present a generalized importance sampling (GIS) estimator based on multiple
Markov chains for empirical Bayes analysis of SGLMMs. The GIS estimator,
although more efficient than the simple importance sampling, can be highly
variable when used to estimate the parameters of certain link functions. Using
suitable reparameterizations of the Monte Carlo samples, we propose modified
GIS estimators that do not suffer from high variability. We use Laplace
approximation for choosing the multiple importance densities in the GIS
estimator. Finally, we develop a methodology for selecting models with
appropriate link function family, which extends to choosing a spatial
correlation function as well. We present an ensemble prediction of the mean
response by appropriately weighting the estimates from different models. The
proposed methodology is illustrated using simulated and real data examples.

constructed out of spacetime quantities only, whose divergence is the exterior

Einstein-Hilbert, Gauss-Bonnet and, in general, the Euler scalar densities can
be written as the divergences of genuine vector densities in the critical

This market modeling is novel in the sense that the prosumption cost function

a ""parameterized"" max-min program, in which the variable of the prosumption

uncertainty in a unified way. In addition, it enables to enforce a market
regulation in which every aggregator is responsible for absorbing his renewable
energy uncertainty by managing his own dispatchable energy resources. Second,

analysis on the premise of several photovoltaic penetration levels. In this
numerical analysis, we demonstrate that renewable generators do not always have
priority of energy supply higher than conventional generators due to their
uncertainty and limited dispatchability, meaning that the merit order of

qualitative parity objective and to minimize a quantitative long-term average
of payoffs (aka. mean payoff). The game is zero-sum and hence the aim of the
other player is to either foil the parity objective or to maximize the mean
payoff.
  Our main technical result is a pseudo-quasi-polynomial algorithm for solving
mean-payoff parity games. All algorithms for the problem that have been
developed for over a decade have a pseudo-polynomial and an exponential factors
in their running times; in the running time of our algorithm the latter is
replaced with a quasi-polynomial one. By the results of Chatterjee and Doyen
(2012) and of Schewe, Weinert, and Zimmermann (2018), our main technical result
implies that there are pseudo-quasi-polynomial algorithms for solving parity
energy games and for solving parity games with weights.
  Our main conceptual contributions are the definitions of strategy
decompositions for both players, and a notion of progress measures for
mean-payoff parity games that generalizes both parity and energy progress
measures. The former provides normal forms for and succinct representations of
winning strategies, and the latter enables the application to mean-payoff
parity games of the order-theoretic machinery that underpins a recent
quasi-polynomial algorithm for solving parity games.

The original goal, actually, is to identify how and by which method we can
induce non-classicality in Raman modes. We introduce a plasmonic system in
which Raman dye molecules are buried between two shells of the plasmonic
materials similar to onion-like core/shell nanoparticle. This system is excited
by the entangled photons, followed by analyzing its dynamics of motion using
the Heisenberg-Langevin equations by which the time evolution of the
signal-idler mode and Raman modes are derived. Interestingly, the entangled
photons are coupled to the plasmonic modes which are used to improve the
non-classicality. It is shown that the exciting system with the entangled
photons lead to inducing the non-classicality in Raman modes and entanglement
between them. This behavior is attributed to the non-classicality of input
modes that is coupled to the Raman modes considering the correlation between
the incident wave frequency and Raman modes frequency. Notably, these quantum
properties are dramatically affected by the environment temperature and Raman
molecules location around the plasmonic nanoparticles. Modelling results
demonstrate that a temperature increase has a drastic effect on system
dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the entanglement between modes in system
surely is affected by the coupling between the incident modes and plasmonic
modes generated by the core/shell nanoparticles. Finally, as an important
result, it is revealed that the Raman modes such as stoke and anti-stoke modes
show a revival behavior, which is a quantum phenomenon.

research over a century. However, there still remains controversy about the
basic mechanisms of their growth. Inspired by previous work on scaling laws in
other systems, here we extend the notion of size of firms from a scalar to a
vector in order to characterize in more detail the mechanisms of growth and
decay of firms. Based on a large scale dataset of Japanese firms covering over
two million firms for two decades (1994-2015), we compile the dataset of
vectors of three components, namely, annual sales, number of employee and
number of trading partners. We find that the number of employees is more
influential in determining firm sales compared to the number of trading
partners. This asymmetry is validated by regressions of sales against these
parameters and the analysis of growth rate correlations. We then explore
multi-variate dynamics of firms by elaborating an evolutionary flow diagram of
the averaged motion in the three-dimensional vector space. The flow diagram
indicates that firms which deviate from the balanced scaling relation tend to
return to this relation. We also find that firms with a chance of large sales
growth suffer the risk of high disappearance rate. These results could serve
for prediction and modeling of firms, and are relevant for theoretical
understanding of the general principles governing complex systems.

structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision
strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and
interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep
k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest
neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of
the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according
to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels
of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the
model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial
examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the
models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to
estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in
the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable
explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several
datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside
the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are
intuitive and useful in understanding model failures.

interband transitions between deeper valence bands and states at the valence

transitions to the valence band maximum are concentrated in the infrared with

besides exhibiting spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP), needs to be highly
scalable, have a large endurance and require low energy for transitioning
between states. In this work, we first introduce and empirically determine two
new specifications for an synapse in SNNs: number of conductance levels per
synapse and maximum learning-rate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
RRAMs that meet the latter specification. As a solution, we propose the use of
multiple PCMO-RRAMs in parallel within a synapse. While synaptic reading, all
PCMO-RRAMs are simultaneously read and for each synaptic conductance-change
event, the mechanism for conductance STDP is initiated for only one RRAM,
randomly picked from the set. Second, to validate our solution, we
experimentally demonstrate STDP of conductance of a PCMO-RRAM and then show
that due to a large learning-rate, a single PCMO-RRAM fails to model a synapse
in the training of an SNN. As anticipated, network training improves as more
PCMO-RRAMs are added to the synapse. Fourth, we discuss the
circuit-requirements for implementing such a scheme, to conclude that the
requirements are within bounds. Thus, our work presents specifications for
synaptic devices in trainable SNNs, indicates the shortcomings of state-of-art
synaptic contenders, and provides a solution to extrinsically meet the
specifications and discusses the peripheral circuitry that implements the

necessary but not sufficient to predict accurate poses. We therefore complement
it with a supervised loss aiming to predict the correct pose in a small set of

spin-densities and spin-symmetry breaking. This necessitates a general
two-component Pauli spinor representation. In this paper, we report the
implementation of a General Hartree-Fock method, without any spin constraints,
for non-perturbative calculations with finite non-uniform fields. London atomic
orbitals are used to ensure faster basis convergence as well as invariance
under constant gauge shifts of the magnetic vector potential. The
implementation has been applied to an investigate the joint orbital and spin
response to a field gradient---quantified through the anapole moments---of a
set of small molecules placed in a linearly varying magnetic field. The
relative contributions of orbital and spin-Zeeman interaction terms have been
studied both theoretically and computationally. Spin effects are stronger and
show a general paramagnetic behaviour for closed shell molecules while orbital
effects can have either direction. Basis set convergence and size effects of
anapole susceptibility tensors have been reported. The relation of the mixed
anapole susceptibility tensor to chirality is also demonstrated.

  design","Accepted by ICASSP 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has the potential to
substantially improve the spectral efficiency, robustness and coverage of
mobile networks. However, such potential is limited by hardware cost and power
consumption associated with a large number of RF chains. Recently, one-bit
quantization is proposed to address this issue by replacing high-resolution
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with one-bit DACs, thereby simplifying the
RF chains. Despite low system cost, advanced signal processing techniques are
needed to compensate for quantization distortions caused by low resolution
DACs. In this paper, a symbol-error-rate (SER)-based one-bit precoding scheme
is proposed to minimize the detection error probability of all users under
one-bit constraints. The problem is recast as a continuous optimization problem
with a biconvex objective. By applying the block coordinate descent (BCD)
method and the FISTA method, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to
obtain a one-bit precoding solution. Simulation results demonstrate its
superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of bit error rate
performance in high-order modulation cases.

regimes of the driving frequency. For lower frequencies, resonances of various
copies of the spectrum lead to intricate formations of topological gaps. In the
Landau-level regime, new wing-like gaps emerge upon reducing the driving
frequency, thus revealing the possibility of dynamically tuning the formation
of the Hofstadter butterfly. In this regime, an effective model may be
analytically derived, which allows us to retrace the energy levels that exhibit
avoided crossings and ultimately lead to gap structures with a wing-like shape.
At high frequencies, we find that gaps open for various fluxes at $E=0$, and
upon increasing the amplitude of the driving, gaps also close and reopen at
other energies. The topological invariants of these gaps are calculated and the
resulting spectrum is elucidated. We suggest opportunities for experimental
realization and discuss similarities with Landau-level structures in non-driven

molecular hydrogen using OH absorption against cm-continuum sources over the
first Galactic quadrant. This OH study is part of the HI/OH/Recombination line
survey (THOR). THOR is a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array large program of
atomic, molecular and ionized gas in the range 15{\deg}$\leq$l$\leq$67{\deg}
and |b|$\leq$1{\deg}. It is the highest-resolution unbiased OH absorption
survey to date towards this region. We combine the derived optical depths with
literature 13CO(1-0) and HI observations to determine the OH abundance. We
detect absorption in the 1665 and 1667 MHz transitions for continuum sources
stronger than $F_{\rm cont}\geq$0.1 Jy/beam. OH absorption is found against
$\sim$15% of these continuum sources with increasing fractions for stronger
sources. Most of the absorption is associated with Galactic HII regions. We
find OH and 13CO gas to have similar kinematic properties. The OH abundance
decreases with increasing hydrogen column density. The OH abundance with
respect to the total hydrogen nuclei column density (atomic and molecular
phase) is in agreement with a constant abundance for $A_V$ < 10-20. Towards the
lowest column densities, we find sources that exhibit OH absorption but no 13CO
emission, indicating that OH is a well suited tracer of the low column density
molecular gas. We present spatially resolved OH absorption towards W43. The
unbiased nature of the THOR survey opens a new window onto the gas properties
of the ISM. The characterization of the OH abundance over a large range of
hydrogen gas column densities contributes to the understanding of OH as a
molecular gas tracer and provides a starting point for future investigations.

understand complex systems, being the most outstanding one the human brain.
These networks have classically been reconstructed using a frequentist approach
that, while simple, completely disregards the uncertainty that derives from
data finiteness. We here provide an alternative solution based on Bayesian
inference, with link weights treated as random variables described by
probability distributions, from which ensembles of networks are sampled. By
using both statistical and topological considerations, we prove that the role
played by links' uncertainty is equivalent to the introduction of a random
rewiring, whose omission leads to a consistent overestimation of topological
structures. We further show that this bias is enhanced in short time series,
suggesting the existence of a theoretical time resolution limit for obtaining
reliable structures. We also propose a simple sampling process for correcting
topological values obtained in frequentist networks. We finally validate these
concepts through synthetic and real network examples, the latter representing
the brain electrical activity of a group of people during a cognitive task.

codes can detect and correct transmission errors if one encodes the original

algorithms are used to decode the received vector. However, these algorithms
may fail to decode if the received vector contains multiple errors. We consider
decoding the received vector with minimum error as an integer programming
problem and propose a branch-and-price method for its solution. We improve the
performance of our method by introducing heuristic feasible solutions and
adding valid cuts to the mathematical formulation. Computational results reveal
that our branch-price-and-cut algorithm significantly improves solvability of
the problem compared to a commercial solver in high channel error rates. Our
proposed algorithm can find higher quality solutions than commonly used
iterative decoding heuristics.

investigate the dependence of this process on the phase difference between the

process is qualitatively insensitive to either choice: the phase difference and
the amplitude ratio are conserved during the evolution. Thus, whereas a truly

equal amplitudes and opposite phases, quasi-stationary compact solitonic
objects are, nevertheless, formed in the general case.

a key technology for scaling up optical quantum information and communication
applications. Nonlinear parametric photon-pair sources and heralded
single-photon sources (HSPSs) had been the most standard resource of quantum
information applications for decades. However, the intrinsic uncertainty of the
produced number of photon pairs in such sources is a critical drawback that
prevents on-demand photon-pair and heralded single-photon generation. Here we
demonstrate large-scale time multiplexing of indistinguishable heralded single
photons, employing a low-loss HSPS and adjustable delay line. We observed 66.7%
presence probability of single-photon states collected into a single-mode
optical fiber by multiplexing 40 periodic time bins of heralded single photons.
To our knowledge, this is the highest fiber-coupled single-photon probability
achieved to date. A high indistinguishability (~90%) of our time-multiplexed
photons has also been confirmed. We also experimentally investigate trade-off
relations of single-photon probability and unwanted multi-photon contribution
by using different pump powers for a HSPS. Our results demonstrate that
low-loss, large-scale multiplexing can realize highly efficient single-photon
generation as well as highly scalable multi-photon generation from inefficient
HSPSs. We predict that our large-scale time multiplexing will pave the way
toward generation of > 30 coincident photons with unprecedented efficiencies,

theoretical rationale to claim that the summation in normal convolution is one
sort of ""linear collusion attack"" which reserves strong correlated patterns
while impairs uncorrelated noises. Therefore in the bottom convolutional layer
which aims at suppressing correlated image contents, we adopt separate
channel-wise convolution without summation instead. Conversely, in the upper
convolutional layers we believe that the summation in normal convolution is
beneficial. Therefore we adopt united normal convolution in those layers and
make them remarkably wider to reinforce the effect of ""linear collusion
attack"". As a result, our proposed wide-and-shallow, separate-then-reunion
network structure is specifically suitable for color image steganalysis. We
have conducted extensive experiments on color image datasets generated from
BOSSBase raw images and another large-scale dataset which contains 100,000 raw
images, with different demosaicking algorithms and down-sampling algorithms.
The experimental results show that our proposed network outperforms other
state-of-the-art color image steganalytic models either hand-crafted or learned
using deep networks in the literature by a clear margin. Specifically, it is
noted that the detection performance gain is achieved with less than half the

energies is dominated by Comptonisation rather than the disc, but there is a
complex pattern in the time lags between different energy bands and differences
in the normalisation and shape in the power spectra of these bands, which
clearly shows that the Comptonisation is not produced from a single,
homogeneous region. We use a physically based model of density fluctuations
propagating through a spectrally inhomogeneous flow, setting the spectral
components by jointly fitting to the time-averaged and Fourier resolved
spectra. The predicted variability in any band is modelled analytically in
Fourier space so it can be fit directly to the observed power spectra and lags.
We find that the best fit model picks out three distinct radii in the flow,
each with a distinct Compton spectrum. The variability and luminosity produced
at these radii is enhanced, while propagation of fluctuations from larger radii
is suppressed. We associate these radii with the disc truncation, the inner
edge of the flow, and (more speculatively) the jet launch radius. These
distinct radii are most evident where the source is close to a transition
between the low/hard and high/soft states. We suggest that the smoother power
spectra seen at lower luminosities imply that the source structure is simpler
away from the transition.

limiting unabsorbed flux in the core is $f_x$ (0.5$-$6.0 keV) $\simeq$ 3
$\times$ 10$^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($L_X$ $\simeq$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{30}$
erg s$^{-1}$ at 5.2 kpc). We estimate that ~$60\pm 20$ of these are cluster
members, of which ~30 lie within the core ($r_c$ $=$ 155 arcsec), and another
~30 between 1$-$2 core radii. We identify four new optical counterparts, for a
total of 45 likely identifications. Probable cluster members include 18
cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates, one quiescent low-mass X-ray
binary, four variable stars, and five stars that are either associated with w
Cen's anomalous red giant branch, or are sub-subgiants. We estimate that the
cluster contains $40\pm 10$ CVs with $L_X$ $>$ 10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
confirming that CVs are underabundant in w Cen relative to the field. Intrinsic
absorption is required to fit X-ray spectra of six of the nine brightest CVs,
suggesting magnetic CVs, or high-inclination systems. Though no radio
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are currently known in w Cen, more than 30
unidentified sources have luminosities and X-ray colours like those of MSPs
found in other globular clusters; these could be responsible for the
Fermi-detected gamma-ray emission from the cluster. Finally, we identify a CH
star as the counterpart to the second-brightest X-ray source in the cluster and
argue that it is a symbiotic star. This is the first such giant/white dwarf
binary to be identified in a globular cluster.

already been addressed for the case of 2D video, but not for 3D. The objective
of this paper is to study the relationship between 3D quality and bitrate at
different frame rates. Our performance evaluations show that increasing the
frame rate of 3D videos beyond 60 fps may not be visually distinguishable. In
addition, our experiments show that when the available bandwidth is reduced,
the highest possible 3D quality of experience can be achieved by adjusting

sequential data. However, RNNs are commonly difficult to train due to the
well-known gradient vanishing and exploding problems and hard to learn
long-term patterns. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit
(GRU) were developed to address these problems, but the use of hyperbolic
tangent and the sigmoid action functions results in gradient decay over layers.
Consequently, construction of an efficiently trainable deep network is
challenging. In addition, all the neurons in an RNN layer are entangled
together and their behaviour is hard to interpret. To address these problems, a
new type of RNN, referred to as independently recurrent neural network
(IndRNN), is proposed in this paper, where neurons in the same layer are
independent of each other and they are connected across layers. We have shown
that an IndRNN can be easily regulated to prevent the gradient exploding and
vanishing problems while allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies.
Moreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions such as
relu (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Multiple IndRNNs
can be stacked to construct a network that is deeper than the existing RNNs.
Experimental results have shown that the proposed IndRNN is able to process
very long sequences (over 5000 time steps), can be used to construct very deep
networks (21 layers used in the experiment) and still be trained robustly.
Better performances have been achieved on various tasks by using IndRNNs
compared with the traditional RNN and LSTM. The code is available at

explores stereoscopic video saliency prediction by exploiting both low-level
attributes such as brightness, color, texture, orientation, motion, and depth,
as well as high-level cues such as face, person, vehicle, animal, text, and
horizon. Our model starts with a rough segmentation and quantifies several
intuitive observations such as the effects of visual discomfort level, depth
abruptness, motion acceleration, elements of surprise, size and compactness of
the salient regions, and emphasizing only a few salient objects in a scene. A
new fovea-based model of spatial distance between the image regions is adopted
for considering local and global feature calculations. To efficiently fuse the
conspicuity maps generated by our method to one single saliency map that is
highly correlated with the eye-fixation data, a random forest based algorithm
is utilized. The performance of the proposed saliency model is evaluated

laser cooling of a molecule. In this paper the laser cooling of a hydride is
studied with rovibronic detail using ab initio quantum chemistry in order to
document the decays to all possible electronic states (not just the vibrational
branching within a single electronic transition) and to identify the most
populated final quantum states. The effect of spin-orbit and associated
couplings on the properties of the lowest excited states of BaH are analysed in
detail. The lifetimes of the A$^2{\Pi}_{1/2}$, H$^2{\Delta}_{3/2}$ and
E$^2{\Pi}_{1/2}$ states are calculated (136 ns, 5.8 {\mu}s and 46 ns
respectively) for the first time, while the theoretical value for
B$^2{\Sigma}^+_{1/2}$ is in good agreement with experiments. Using a simple
rate model the numbers of absorption-emission cycles possible for both one- and
two-colour cooling on the competing electronic transitions are determined, and
it is clearly demonstrated that the A$^2{\Pi}$ - X$^2{\Sigma}^+$ transition is
superior to B$^2{\Sigma}^+$ - X$^2{\Sigma}^+$, where multiple tiny decay
channels degrade its efficiency. Further possible improvements to the cooling

biological matter, such as protein aggregation, is inherently challenging.
These processes emerge from the simultaneous action of multiple molecular
mechanisms, each of which is associated with the rearrangement of a large
number of weak bonds, resulting in a complex free energy landscape with many
kinetic barriers. Reaction rate measurements of supramolecular processes at
different temperatures can offer unprecedented insights into the underlying
molecular mechanisms and their thermodynamic properties. However, to be able to
interpret such measurements in terms of the underlying microscopic mechanisms,
a key challenge is to establish which properties of the complex free energy
landscapes are probed by the reaction rate. Here, we present a reaction rate
theory for supramolecular kinetics based on Kramers rate theory for diffusive
reactions over multiple kinetic barriers, and apply the results to protein
aggregation. Using this framework and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that
reaction rates for protein aggregation are of the Arrhenius-Eyring type and
that the associated activation energies probe only one relevant barrier along
the respective free energy landscapes. We apply this advancement to interpret,
both in experiments and in coarse-grained computer simulations, reaction rate
measurements of amyloid aggregation kinetics in terms of the underlying
molecular mechanisms and associated thermodynamic signatures. Our results
establish a general platform for probing the mechanisms and energetics of
supramolecular phenomena in soft- and biological matter using the framework of

Currently, one does not even know whether S_{d,k} is optimal within the family

In view of this, it makes sense to look at even narrower families, for example,

increase the total number of rapid optical transients by more than factor of
two. They are found at a wide range of redshifts ($0.05<z<1.56$) and peak
brightnesses ($-15.75>M_\mathrm{g}>-22.25$). The multiband photometry is well
fit by a blackbody up to few weeks after peak. The events appear to be hot
($T\approx10000-30000$ K) and large ($R\approx 10^{14}-2\cdot10^{15}$ cm) at
peak, and generally expand and cool in time, though some events show evidence
for a receding photosphere with roughly constant temperature. Spectra taken
around peak are dominated by a blue featureless continuum consistent with hot,
optically thick ejecta. We compare our events with a previously suggested
physical scenario involving shock breakout in an optically thick wind
surrounding a core-collapse supernova (CCSNe), we conclude that current models
for such a scenario might need an additional power source to describe the
exponential decline. We find these transients tend to favor star-forming host

with other pathogens. This cooperative effect can give rise to violent
outbreaks, reflecting the presence of an abrupt epidemic transition. As for
other diffusive dynamics, the topology of the interaction pattern of the host
population plays a crucial role. It was conjectured that a discontinuous
transition arises when there are relatively few short loops and many long loops
in the contact network. Here we focus on the role of local clustering in
determining the nature of the transition. We consider two mutually cooperative
pathogens diffusing in the same population: an individual already infected with
one disease has an increased probability of getting infected by the other. We
look at how a disease obeying the susceptible-infected-removed dynamics spreads
on contact networks with tunable clustering. Using numerical simulations we
show that for large cooperativity the epidemic transition is always abrupt,
with the discontinuity decreasing as clustering is increased. For large
clustering strong finite size effects are present and the discontinuous nature
of the transition is manifest only in large networks. We also investigate the
problem of influential spreaders for cooperative infections, revealing that
both cooperativity and clustering strongly enhance the dependence of the
spreading influence on the degree of the initial seed.

vulnerabilities than both. We will start this presentation with the design of a
targeted search strategy for KLEE, sonar-search, that prioritizes paths leading
to a target function, rather than maximizing overall path coverage in the

(compositional analysis) leads to discovering more vulnerabilities than
symbolic execution from a single entry point. Using this finding, we will,
then, demonstrate a greybox fuzzing method that can achieve higher function

is not directly accessible. Using melting probe technology is one of the
promising technological approaches to reach those scientifically interesting
water reservoirs. Melting probes basically consist of a heated melting head on
top of an elongated body that contains the scientific payload. The traditional
engineering approach to design such melting probes starts from a global energy
balance around the melting head and quantifies the power necessary to sustain a
specific melting velocity while preventing the probe from refreezing and stall
in the channel. Though this approach is sufficient to design simple melting
probes for terrestrial applications, it is too simplistic to study the probe's
performance for environmental conditions found on some of the Ocean's Worlds,
e.g. a lower value of the gravitational acceleration. This will be important,
however, when designing exploration technologies for extraterrestrial purposes.
We tackle the problem by explicitly modeling the physical processes in the thin
melt film between the probe and the underlying ice. Our model allows to study
melting regimes on bodies of different gravitational acceleration, and we
explicitly compare melting regimes on Europa, Enceladus and Mars. In addition
to that, our model allows to quantify the heat losses due to convective
transport around the melting probe. We discuss to which extent these heat
losses can be utilized to avoid the necessity of a side wall heating system to
prevent stall, and introduce the notion of the 'Critical Refreezing Length'.
Our results allow to draw important conclusions towards the design of melting
probe technology for future missions to icy bodies in our Solar System.

excitation, which appears in a narrow temperature range just across the

symmetry changes across the monoclinic to rhombohedral phase transition, phonon
eigenfrequencies and the majority of spin-orbital excitations are not strongly

the eigenfrequencies of most of these excitations. Finally, from this combined

atmosphere is frequently modelled via a single-fluid approximation, which is
valid for the case of a strongly coupled collisional media, such as solar
photosphere and low chromosphere. Under the single-fluid formalism the main
non-ideal effects are described by a series of extra terms in the generalised
induction equation and in the energy conservation equation. These effects are:
Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, the Hall effect, and the Biermann battery
effect. From the point of view of the numerical solution of the single-fluid
equations, when ambipolar diffusion or Hall effects dominate can introduce
severe restrictions on the integration time step and can compromise the
stability of the numerical scheme. In this paper we introduce two numerical
schemes to overcome those limitations. The first of them is known as Super
Time-Stepping (STS) and it is designed to overcome the limitations imposed when
the ambipolar diffusion term is dominant. The second scheme is called the Hall
Diffusion Scheme (HDS) and it is used when the Hall term becomes dominant.
These two numerical techniques can be used together by applying Strang operator
splitting. This paper describes the implementation of the STS and HDS schemes
in the single-fluid code Mancha3D. The validation for each of these schemes is
provided by comparing the analytical solution with the numerical one for a
suite of numerical tests.

collapse of gas and giant burst of central star formation, followed by the
later accretion of material that builds up their stellar and dark matter
haloes. The globular cluster systems of such galaxies are believed to form in a
similar manner. The initial central burst forms metal-rich (red) clusters,
while more metal-poor (blue) clusters are brought in by the later accretion of
less massive satellites. This formation process is thought to lead the creation
of the multimodal optical colour distributions seen in the globular cluster
systems of massive galaxies. Here we report HST/ACS observations of the massive
relic galaxy NGC 1277 and its globular clusters, a nearby unevolved example of
a high redshift ""red nugget"". The g-z cluster colour distribution shows that
the globular cluster system of the galaxy is unimodal and uniquely red. This is
in strong contrast to normal galaxies of similar and larger stellar mass, whose
cluster systems always exhibit (and are generally dominated by) blue clusters.
We argue that the globular cluster system of NGC 1277 indicates that the galaxy
has undergone little (if any) mass accretion after its initial collapse and use
analytic merger trees to show that the total stellar mass accretion is likely
less than ~ 10 %. These results confirm that NGC 1277 is a genuine relic galaxy
and show that the blue, metal-poor globular clusters constitute an accreted
population in present day massive galaxies.

performed on 1-second NYSE data, shows that opening hours are dominated by
idiosyncratic risk and that a market factor progressively emerges in the second

models: hyperbolic random graphs (HRG), geometric inhomogeneous random graphs
(GIRG) and scale-free percolation (SFP). In HRGs, $n=\Theta(\mathrm{e}^{R/2})$
vertices are sampled independently from the hyperbolic disk with radius $R$ and
two vertices are connected either when they are within hyperbolic distance $R$,
or independently with a probability depending on the hyperbolic distance. In
GIRGs and SFP, each vertex is given an independent weight and location from an
underlying measured metric space and $\mathbb{Z}^d$, respectively, and two
vertices are connected independently with a probability that is a function of
their distance and weights. We assign i.i.d. weights to the edges of the random
graphs and study the weighted distance between two uniformly chosen vertices.
In SFP, we study the weighted distance from the origin of vertex-sequences with
norm tending to infinity. In particular, we study the case when the parameters
are so that the degree distribution in the graph follows a power law with
exponent $\tau\in(2,3)$ (infinite variance), and the edge-weight distribution
is such that it produces an explosive age-dependent branching process with
power-law offspring distribution. We show that in all three models, typical
distances within the giant/infinite component converge in distribution, solving
an open question in [Explosion and distances in scale-free percolation (2017)].
The main tools of our proof are to couple the models to infinite versions, to
follow the shortest paths to infinity and to connect these paths using
weight-dependent percolation on the graphs: delete edges attached to vertices
with higher weight with higher probability. We realise this using the
edge-weights: only short edges connected to high weight vertices will stay,
yielding arbitrarily short upper bounds for the connections.

proposed algorithm, watermark casting is performed separately in each block of
an image, and embedding in each block continues until a certain structural
similarity threshold is reached. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that our
scheme improves the imperceptibility of the watermark when the capacity remains
fix, and at the same time, robustness against attacks is assured. The proposed
method is applicable to most image watermarking algorithms. We verify this
issue on watermarking schemes in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), wavelet, and
spatial domain.

vital for administrator and analyst to trust and act on the automated analysis
of machine learning models. Deep learning methods have been criticized as black
box oracles which allow limited insight into decision factors. In this work we
seek to ""bridge the gap"" between the impressive performance of deep learning
models and the need for interpretable model introspection. To this end we
present recurrent neural network (RNN) language models augmented with attention
for anomaly detection in system logs. Our methods are generally applicable to
any computer system and logging source.
  By incorporating attention variants into our RNN language models we create
opportunities for model introspection and analysis without sacrificing
state-of-the art performance.
  We demonstrate model performance and illustrate model interpretability on an
intrusion detection task using the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) cyber

known as The Vibrating String Controversy, spanned the whole of 1700s and
involved a group of the most eminent scientists of the time. After that, the
model stood undisputed for over two centuries. In this study, it is shown that
not only this 300-year-old model cannot correspond to reality, but it is
theoretically not quite plausible, either. A new 2D model is developed removing
all the assumptions of the classical model. The result is a pair of non-linear
partial differential equations modeling 2D motions of a finite 1D string. A
theorem that can be used to determine the initial displacement functions from
the initial shape of the string is proven. The new model is capable of
representing initial conditions that cannot be handled in the classical model.
It also allows initially non-taut/non-slack strings and self-intersecting
shapes. The classical model and the non-taut strings emerge as special limit
cases. It is proven that pure transverse motions of a 1D string are possible
only in very rare cases. A theorem that sets the conditions for pure transverse
motions is also presented. Numerical studies of interesting cases are presented
in support of the new model. High-speed camera experiments are also conducted,

recently, it was believed that proportional electroluminescence was fully due
to VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with
excited atoms, the latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons. In this
work we consider an additional mechanism of proportional electroluminescence,

a dedicated two-phase detector with EL gap optically read out by cryogenic PMTs

intriguing observations in EL radiation: that of the substantial contribution
of the non-VUV spectral component, extending from the UV to NIR, and that of
the photon emission at lower electric fields, below the Ar excitation
threshold. Possible applications of neutral bremsstrahlung effect in two-phase

derived. The spectral running coupling constant is computed and is shown to

to diverge for all non-zero energies.

acquisition in many scientific researches such as driving style identification
systems. In the present paper, smartphone data are used to evaluate the driving
styles based on maneuvers analysis. The data obtained for each maneuver is the
speed of the vehicle steering and the vehicle's direct and lateral
acceleration. To classify the drivers based on their driving style,
machine-learning algorithms can be used on these data. However, these data
usually contains more information than it is needed and cause a bad effect on
the learning accuracy. In addition, they may transfer some wrong information to
the learning algorithm. Thus, we used Haar discrete wavelet transformation to
remove noise effects. Then, we get the discrete wavelet transformation with
four levels from smartphone sensors data, which include low-to-high
frequencies, respectively. The obtained features vector for each maneuver
includes the raw signal variance as well as the variance of the wavelet
transform components. On these vectors, we use the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm for features selection. Then, we use SVM, RBF and MLP neural networks
on these features to separate braking and dangerous speed maneuvers from the
safe ones as well as dangerous turning, U-turn and lane-changing maneuvers. The
results are very interesting.

compiled 36 measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ in the redshifts
intermediate $0.07\leqslant z \leqslant 2.36$. Moreover, we use these models to
estimate the redshift of the deceleration-acceleration transition. We consider
two Gaussian priors for current value of the Hubble constant i.e
$H_{0}=73\pm1.74 (68\pm 2.8)$ km/s/Mpc to investigate the effect of the assumed
$H_{0}$ on our parameters estimations. For statistical analysis we use NUTS
sampler which is an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to generate
MCMC chains for parameters of dark energy models. To compare the considered
cosmologies, we perform Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes factor
($\Psi$). In general, when we compared our results with 9 years WMAP as well as

characterises the standard sequential product on either a von Neumann algebra

application of unital order isomorphisms, (2) symmetry of the sequential
product with respect to a certain inner product, and (3) preservation of
invertibility of the effects. To give these characterisations we first have to
study convex $\sigma$-sequential effect algebras. We show that these objects

advantage of massive parallel computing of field-programmable gate array

performed by means of our recently established divide-and-conquer semiclassical
approach [M. Ceotto, G. Di Liberto, and R. Conte, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 010401
(2017)]. This technique allows us to simulate quantum vibrational spectra of
high-dimensional systems starting from full-dimensional classical trajectories
and projection of the semiclassical propagator onto a set of lower dimensional
subspaces. The potential energy surface employed is a many-body representation
up to three-body terms, in which monomers and two-body interactions are
described by the high level Wang-Huang-Braams-Bowman (WHBB) water potential,
while, for three-body interactions, calculations adopt a fast permutationally
invariant ab initio surface at the same level of theory of the WHBB 3-body
potential. Applications range from the water dimer up to the water decamer, a
system made of 84 vibrational degrees of freedom. Results are generally in
agreement with previous variational estimates in the literature. This is
particularly true for the bending and the high-frequency stretching motions,
while estimates of modes strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding are red
shifted, in a few instances even substantially, as a consequence of the
dynamical and global picture provided by the semiclassical approach.
