Beltrami field with eigenvalue 2, is an energy minimizer in its adjoint orbit

property for Beltrami fields is relevant because of its connections with the
phenomenon of magnetic relaxation and the hydrodynamic stability of steady
Euler flows. We characterize the Sasakian manifolds where the Reeb field is a
minimizer in terms of the first positive eigenvalue of the curl operator and
show that for $a>a_0$ (a constant that depends on the Sasakian structure) the
Reeb field of the $\mathcal{D}$-homothetic deformation of the manifold with
constant $a$ (which is still Sasakian) is an unstable critical point of the
energy, and hence not even a local minimizer. We also provide some examples of
Sasakian manifolds where the Reeb field is a minimizer, highlighting the case
of the weighted 3-spheres, on which another minimization problem (for the
quartic Skyrme-Faddeev energy) is shown to admit exact solutions.

way to support large scale data storage and query processing. However, due to
security and privacy concerns, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) need to
be protected from the cloud server and other unauthorized users. One approach
is to outsource encrypted data to the cloud server and have the cloud server
perform query processing on the encrypted data only. It remains a challenging
task to support various queries over encrypted data in a secure and efficient
way such that the cloud server does not gain any knowledge about the data,

queries over encrypted data. The skyline query is particularly important for
multi-criteria decision making but also presents significant challenges due to
its complex computations. We propose a fully secure skyline query protocol on
data encrypted using semantically-secure encryption. As a key subroutine, we
present a new secure dominance protocol, which can be also used as a building
block for other queries. Furthermore, we demonstrate two optimizations, data
partitioning and lazy merging, to further reduce the computation load. Finally,
we provide both serial and parallelized implementations and empirically study
the protocols in terms of efficiency and scalability under different parameter

has many favorable properties. One of its nicest geometric/duality properties
is the fact that the vertices of its feasible region correspond exactly to the
cuts of a graph, as proved by Laurent and Poljak in 1995. Recall that a
boundary point $x$ of a convex set $C$ is called a vertex of $C$ if the normal
cone of $C$ at $x$ is full-dimensional.
  We study how often strict complementarity holds or fails for the MaxCut SDP
when a vertex of the feasible region is optimal, i.e., when the SDP relaxation
is tight. While strict complementarity is known to hold when the objective
function is in the interior of the normal cone at any vertex, we prove that it
fails generically at the boundary of such normal cone. In this regard, the
MaxCut SDP displays the nastiest behavior possible for a convex optimization
problem.
  We also study strict complementarity with respect to two classes of objective
functions. We show that, when the objective functions are sampled uniformly
from the negative semidefinite rank-one matrices in the boundary of the normal
cone at any vertex, the probability that strict complementarity holds lies in
$(0,1)$. We also extend a construction due to Laurent and Poljak of weighted
Laplacian matrices for which strict complementarity fails. Their construction
works for complete graphs, and we extend it to cosums of graphs under some mild
conditions.

scheme, we show that it is more effective than active immunization. Besides, we
give a comprehensive theoretical analysis on applying targeted immunization to
directed networks. For targeted immunization strategy, we prove that immunizing
nodes with large out-degrees are more effective than immunizing nodes with
large in-degrees, and nodes with both large out-degrees and large in-degrees
are more worthy to be immunized than nodes with only large out-degrees or large
in-degrees. Finally, some numerical analysis are performed to verify and

reward sparsity, reward delay, and the perceptual complexity of the task. When
comparing TD with infinite-horizon MC, we are able to reproduce classic results
in modern settings. Yet we also find that finite-horizon MC is not inferior to
TD, even when rewards are sparse or delayed. This makes MC a viable alternative
to TD in deep RL.

important applications including intelligence surveillance, robot navigation
and autonomous driving. In existing MOT methods, individual object's movements
and inter-object relations are mostly modeled separately and relations between
them are still manually tuned. In addition, inter-object relations are mostly
modeled in a symmetric way, which we argue is not an optimal setting. To tackle
those difficulties, in this paper, we propose a Deep Continuous Conditional
Random Field (DCCRF) for solving the online MOT problem in a track-by-detection
framework. The DCCRF consists of unary and pairwise terms. The unary terms
estimate tracked objects' displacements across time based on visual appearance
information. They are modeled as deep Convolution Neural Networks, which are
able to learn discriminative visual features for tracklet association. The
asymmetric pairwise terms model inter-object relations in an asymmetric way,
which encourages high-confidence tracklets to help correct errors of
low-confidence tracklets and not to be affected by low-confidence ones much.
The DCCRF is trained in an end-to-end manner for better adapting the influences
of visual information as well as inter-object relations. Extensive experimental
comparisons with state-of-the-arts as well as detailed component analysis of
our proposed DCCRF on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed MOT framework.

mass-digitisation projects that are currently under way, and coupled with the
ever-increasing number of documents which are ""born digital"". As such, new
interactive tools are required to discover and extract macroscopic patterns
from these vast quantities of textual data. Here we present History Playground,
an interactive web-based tool for discovering trends in massive textual
corpora. The tool makes use of scalable algorithms to first extract trends from
textual corpora, before making them available for real-time search and
discovery, presenting users with an interface to explore the data. Included in
the tool are algorithms for standardization, regression, change-point detection
in the relative frequencies of ngrams, multi-term indices and comparison of
trends across different corpora.

disruptions to their environment? We show that current approaches to penalizing
side effects can introduce bad incentives, e.g. to prevent any irreversible
changes in the environment, including the actions of other agents. To isolate
the source of such undesirable incentives, we break down side effects penalties
into two components: a baseline state and a measure of deviation from this
baseline state. We argue that some of these incentives arise from the choice of
baseline, and others arise from the choice of deviation measure. We introduce a
new variant of the stepwise inaction baseline and a new deviation measure based
on relative reachability of states. The combination of these design choices
avoids the given undesirable incentives, while simpler baselines and the
unreachability measure fail. We demonstrate this empirically by comparing
different combinations of baseline and deviation measure choices on a set of
gridworld experiments designed to illustrate possible bad incentives.

mock theta of Ramanujan. In 1964, George Andrews proved an asymptotic formula
of the form $$\alpha(n)= \sum_{c\leq\sqrt{n}}
\psi(n)+O_\epsilon\left(n^\epsilon\right),$$ where $\psi(n)$ is an expression
involving generalized Kloosterman sums and the $I$-Bessel function. Andrews
conjectured that the series converges to $\alpha(n)$ when extended to infinity,
and that it does not converge absolutely. Bringmann and Ono proved the first of
these conjectures. Here we obtain a power savings bound for the error in
Andrews' formula, and we also prove the second of these conjectures.
  Our methods depend on the spectral theory of Maass forms of half-integral
weight, and in particular on an average estimate which we derive for the
Fourier coefficients of such forms which gives a power savings in the spectral
parameter.
  As a further application of this result, we derive a formula which expresses
$\alpha(n)$ with small error as a sum of exponential terms over imaginary
quadratic points (this is similar in spirit to a recent result of Masri). We
also obtain a bound for the size of the error term incurred by truncating
Rademacher's analytic formula for the ordinary partition function which
improves a result of the first author and Andersen when $24n-23$ is squarefree.

observable probabilities, the real space distinction between the pointer
distributions corresponding to post-interaction pointer states play crucial
role. It is implicitly assumed that mutual orthogonality ensures the support
between the post-interaction pointer distributions to be disjoint. We point out
that mutual orthogonality (formal idealness) does \emph{not} necessarily imply
the real space distinguishability (operational idealness), but converse is
true. In fact, for the commonly referred Gaussian wavefunction, it is possible
to obtain a measurement situation which is formally ideal but fully nonideal
operationally. In this paper, we derive a class of pointer states, that we call
faithful pointers, for which the degree of formal (non)idealness is equal to
the operational (non)idealness. In other words, for the faithful pointers, if a
measurement situation is formally ideal then it is operationally ideal and vice

a redshift of $z=5.72$ close to the presumed end of the Epoch of Reionisation.
The radio galaxy was selected from the TGSS ADR1 survey at 150 MHz for having
to an ultra-steep spectral index, $\alpha^{\textrm{150 MHz}}_{\textrm{1.4 GHz}}
= -1.4$ and a compact morphology obtained using VLA imaging at 1.4 GHz. No
optical or infrared counterparts for it were found in publicly available sky
surveys. Follow-up optical spectroscopy at the radio position using GMOS on
Gemini North revealed the presence of a single emission line. We identify this
line as Lyman alpha at $z=5.72$, because of its asymmetric line profile, the
absence of other optical/UV lines in the spectrum and a high equivalent width.
With a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $5.7 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a FWHM of
$370$ km s$^{-1}$, TGSS1530 is comparable to `non-radio' Lyman alpha emitters
(LAEs) at a similar redshift. However, with a radio luminosity of $\log
L_{\textrm{150 MHz}} = 29.1$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and a deconvolved physical size $3.5$
kpc, its radio properties are similar to other known radio galaxies at $z>4$.
Subsequent $J$ and $K$ band imaging using LUCI on the Large Binocular Telescope
resulted in non-detection of the host galaxy down to $3\sigma$ limits of
$J>24.4$ and $K>22.4$ (Vega). The $K$ band limit is consistent with $z>5$ from
the $K-z$ relation for radio galaxies, suggesting stellar mass limits using
simple stellar population models of $M_{\textrm{stars}}< 10^{10.5}$ $M_\odot$.
Its high redshift coupled with relatively small radio and Ly$\alpha$ sizes
suggest that TGSS1530 may be a radio galaxy in an early phase of its evolution.

K_\text{S}^0\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D\to K_\text{S}^0K^+K^-$, is used to perform a
measurement of the CP-violating observables $x_{\pm}$ and $y_{\pm}$, which are
sensitive to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle $\gamma$. The analysis is
performed without assuming any $D$ decay model, through the use of information
on the strong-phase variation over the Dalitz plot from the CLEO collaboration.
Using a sample of proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb
experiment in 2015 and 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
2.0$\,\text{fb}^{-1}$, the values of the CP violation parameters are found to
be $x_- = ( 9.0 \pm 1.7 \pm 0.7 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-2}$, $y_- = ( 2.1 \pm 2.2
\pm 0.5 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-2}$, $x_+ = (- 7.7 \pm 1.9 \pm 0.7 \pm 0.4) \times
10^{-2}$, and $y_+ = (- 1.0 \pm 1.9 \pm 0.4 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{-2}$. The first
uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to
the uncertainty on the strong-phase measurements. These values are used to
obtain $\gamma = \left(87\,^{+11}_{-12}\right)^\circ$, $r_B = 0.086^{+
0.013}_{-0.014}$, and $\delta_B = (101 \pm 11)^\circ$, where $r_B$ is the ratio
between the suppressed and favoured $B$-decay amplitudes and $\delta_B$ is the
corresponding strong-interaction phase difference. This measurement is combined
with the result obtained using 2011 and 2012 data collected with the \lhcb
experiment, to give $\gamma = \left(80\,^{+10}_{\,-9}\right)^\circ$, $r_B =
0.080 \pm 0.011$, and $\delta_B = (110 \pm 10)^\circ$.

classification, language processing, and gameplay, few can construct or modify
a complex system such as a tower of blocks. We hypothesize that what these
systems lack is a ""relational inductive bias"": a capacity for reasoning about
inter-object relations and making choices over a structured description of a
scene. To test this hypothesis, we focus on a task that involves gluing pairs
of blocks together to stabilize a tower, and quantify how well humans perform.
We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning agent which uses object- and
relation-centric scene and policy representations and apply it to the task. Our
results show that these structured representations allow the agent to
outperform both humans and more naive approaches, suggesting that relational
inductive bias is an important component in solving structured reasoning
problems and for building more intelligent, flexible machines.

of the second-order injection and shift currents of the bulk photovoltaic
effect. We also revisit the theory of the bulk photovoltaic effect and include
Fermi surface contributions which are important in metals. Finally, we show
that injection, shift, and jerk currents admit simple physical interpretations

violation of a three-time Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) for a dichotomic qutrit
system can exceed the L$\ddot{u}$ders bound. This is obtained by using a
degeneracy breaking projective measurement rule which the authors termed as von
Neumann rule. Such violation can even approach the algebraic maximum in the
asymptotic limit of system size. In this paper, we question the implication of
such violation of L$\ddot{u}$ders bound and its conceptual relevance in LG
scenario. We note an important fact that the basis for implementing the
proposed von Neumann rule for a degenerate observable is non-unique and show
that the violation of L$\ddot{u}$ders bound is crucially dependent on the
choice of basis. Further, we demonstrate the violation of L$\ddot{u}$ders bound
of the simplest non-contextual inequality (NCI) which is in contrast to the
reasoning provided in the aforementioned Letter. This result further raises the
doubts regarding the validity of the proposed rule as a viable projective
measurement. We discuss the relevance of such results with respect to the usual
quantum violation of LGI and NCI.

in many cases the orbit elements satisfy some strong arithmetic properties. It
is well known that the $c$ values for which $f_{c,d}$ has tail size $m\geq 1$
and period $n$ are the roots of a polynomial $G_d(m,n) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, and
the irreducibility or not of $G_d(m,n)$ has been a great mystery. As a
consequence of our work, for any prime $d$, we establish the irreducibility of
these $G_d(m,n)$ polynomials for infinitely many pairs $(m,n)$. These appear to
be the first known such infinite families of $(m,n)$. We also prove that all
the iterates of $f_{c,d}$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(c)$ if $d$ is a

loop-parameters chosen on the basis of these stability conditions ensure that
chattering phenomenon does not occur during switching between different

  quantum violation","Comments are welcome!",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the derivation of local bound of a Bell's inequality, the response
functions corresponding to the different outcomes of measurements are fixed by
the relevant hidden variables irrespective of the fact if the measurement is
unsharp. In the context of a recent result by Spekkens that tells even in an
ontological model the unsharp observable cannot be assigned a deterministic
response function, we derive a modified local bound of CHSH inequality in
unsharp measurement scenario. We consider response function for a given POVM
which is determined by the response functions of the relevant projectors
appearing in its spectral representation. In this scenario, the local bound of
CHSH inequality is found to be dependent on the unsharpness parameter. This
then enables us to show that the quantum violation of CHSH inequality for
unbiased spin-POVMs occurs whenever there is violation for their sharp
counterpart. For the case of biased POVMs, it is shown that the quantum
violation of CHSH inequality can be obtained for ranges of sharpness parameter
for which no violation obtained using standard local bound of CHSH inequality.

planetary ring which is close to the threshold for viscous overstability. We
solve numerically the hydrodynamical equations for a dense, axisymmetric thin
disk in the vicinity of an inner Lindblad resonance with a perturbing
satellite. The spiral shape of a density wave is taken into account through a
suitable approximation of the advective terms arising from the fluid orbital
motion. This paper is a first attempt to model the co-existence of resonantly
forced density waves and short-scale axisymmetric overstable wavetrains in
Saturn's rings by conducting large-scale hydrodynamical integrations. These
integrations reveal that the two wave types undergo complex interactions, not
taken into account in existing models for the damping of density waves. In
particular it is found that, depending on the relative magnitude of both wave
types, the presence of viscous overstability can lead to a damping of an
unstable density wave and vice versa. The damping of viscous overstability by a
density wave is investigated further by employing a simplified model of an
axisymmetric ring perturbed by a nearby Lindblad resonance. A linear
hydrodynamic stability analysis as well as local N-body simulations of this
model system are performed and support the results of our large-scale
hydrodynamical integrations.

the Born approximation of the photon diffusion. In this paper we study the
performance of quadratic estimators when applied to realistic sky maps

personal genome interpretation in the realm of precision medicine. There are 13
possible relations between two intervals according to Allen's interval algebra.
Conventional interval trees are routinely used to identify the genomic
intervals satisfying a coarse relation with a query interval, but cannot
support efficient query for more refined relations such as all Allen's
relations. We design and implement a novel approach to address this unmet need.
Through rewriting Allen's interval relations, we transform an interval query to
a range query, then adapt and utilize the range trees for querying. We
implement two types of range trees: a basic 2-dimensional range tree (2D-RT)
and an augmented range tree with fractional cascading (RTFC) and compare them
with the conventional interval tree (IT). Theoretical analysis shows that RTFC
can achieve the best time complexity for interval queries regarding all Allen's
relations among the three trees. We also perform comparative experiments on the
efficiency of RTFC, 2D-RT and IT in querying noncoding element annotations in a
large collection of personal genomes. Our experimental results show that 2D-RT
is more efficient than IT for interval queries regarding most of Allen's
relations, RTFC is even more efficient than 2D-RT. The results demonstrate that
RTFC is an efficient data structure for querying large-scale datasets regarding
Allen's relations between genomic intervals, such as those required by
interpreting genome-wide variation in large populations.

minimum of 2 snapshots taken at different pump-probe delays. Alternatively,
without any pre-characterization, our method can retrieve both unperturbed and

diffuse X-ray emission. Diffuse emission was detected in the sub-bands Soft
[0.5 : 1.2] and Medium [1.2 : 2.5], and marginally in the Hard [2.5 : 7.0] keV
band. From X-ray spectral analysis of stacked spectra we compute a total [0.5 :
7.0 keV] diffuse X-ray luminosity of L$_{\rm x}^{\rm
diff}\approx$4.2$\times$10$^{\rm 34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, characterized with plasma
temperature components at kT$\approx$ 0.11, 0.40 and 1.18 keV, respectively.
The HI absorption column density corresponding to these temperatures has a
distribution consistent with N$_{\rm H}$ = 0.43, 0.80 and 1.39
$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The extended medium band energy emission likely
arises from O-type stellar winds thermalized by wind-wind collisions in the
most populated regions of the association, while the soft band emission
probably arises from less energetic termination shocks against the surrounding
Interstellar-Medium. Super-soft and Soft diffuse emission appears more widely
dispersed and intense than the medium band emission. The diffuse X-ray emission
is generally spatially coincident with low-extinction regions that we attribute
to the ubiquitous influence of powerful stellar winds from massive stars and
their interaction with the local Interstellar-Medium. Diffuse X-ray emission is
volume-filling, rather than edge-brightened, oppositely to other star-forming
regions. We reveal the first observational evidence of X-ray haloes around some
evolved massive stars.

positive function, defined by a self-consistent equation, typical for certain
problems in physics and mathematics. In this approach, the function's
properties are represented statistically by lists containing a large collection
of sets of coordinates (or ""walkers"") that are distributed according to the
function's value. The coordinates are generated stochastically by the
Metropolis algorithm and may replace older entries according to some protocol.
While stochastic lists offer a solution to the impossibility of efficiently
computing and storing multi-variable functions without a systematic bias,
extrapolation in the inverse of the number of walkers is usually difficult,
even though in practice very good results are found already for short lists.
This situation is reminiscent of diffusion Monte Carlo, and is hence generic
for all population-based methods. We illustrate the method by computing the
lowest-order vertex corrections in Hedin's scheme for the Fr\""ohlich polaron

transportation-based ones introduced in Chernozhukov et al. (2017) enjoy all
the properties that make univariate quantiles and ranks successful tools for
semiparametric statistical inference.
  We therefore propose a new center-outward definition of multivariate

for which we obtain a Glivenko-Cantelli result. Our approach is geometric and,
contrary to the Monge-Kantorovich one in Chernozhukov et al. (2017), does not

distribution-free, and maximal invariant under the action of a data-driven
class of (order-preserving) transformations generating the family of absolutely
continuous distributions; that property is the theoretical foundation of the
semiparametric efficiency preservation property of ranks. The corresponding
quantiles are equivariant under the same transformations.
  The empirical proposed distribution functions are defined at observed values
only. A continuous extension to the entire $\mathbb{R}^d$, yielding continuous
empirical quantile contours while preserving the monotonicity and
Glivenko-Cantelli features is desirable. Such extension requires solving a
nontrivial problem of smooth interpolation under cyclical monotonicity
constraints. A complete solution of that problem is given in Chapter 2; we show
that the resulting distribution and quantile functions are Lipschitz, and
provide a sharp lower bound for the Lipschitz constants. A numerical study of

consists of droplets or bicontinuous demixed domains and the physics is
controlled by the interfaces between these domains. At continuum level, the
structure is defined by a composition field whose gradients which are steep
near interfaces drive its diffusive current. These gradients also cause
thermodynamic stresses which can drive fluid flow. Fluid flow in turn advects
the composition field, while thermal noise creates additional random fluxes
that allow the system to explore its configuration space and move towards the
Boltzmann distribution. This article introduces continuum models of binary
fluids, first covering some well-studied areas such as the thermodynamics and
kinetics of phase separation, and emulsion stability. We then address cases
where one of the fluid components has anisotropic structure at mesoscopic
scales creating nematic (or polar) liquid-crystalline order; this can be
described through an additional tensor (or vector) order parameter field. We
conclude by outlining a thriving area of current research, namely active

crystal structures (at least one 3D and several 2D layered structures have been
reported) with diverse electrical and optical properties. This feature has
plagued its characterization over the years, with reported band gaps varying in
an unacceptable range of 1 eV. Using first-principles calculations based on
density functional theory and the HSE06 hybrid functional, we investigated the
structural and electronic properties of four layered phases of In$_2$Se$_3$,
addressing their relative stability and the nature of their fundamental band
gaps, i.e., direct {\em versus} indirect. Our results show large disparities
between fundamental and optical gaps. The absorption coefficients are found to
be as high as that in direct-gap III-V semiconductors. The band alignment with
respect to conventional semiconductors indicate a tendency to $n$-type
conductivity, explaining recent experimental observations.

photocatalyst and to understand its surface chemistry. In this work we present
a comparative study of the OER on the oxide NaTaO$_3$ (113) surface and the
oxynitride SrTaO$_2$N (001) surface. Oxynitrides are highly promising
photocatalysts due to their smaller band gap and resulting better visible light
absorption compared to oxides but our knowledge about their surface structure
and chemistry is still very limited. With the goal to compare the surface
chemistry of oxides and oxynitrides, we perform density functional theory
calculations to obtain the free energy changes associated with the OER reaction
steps. For the OER at the Ta site of the clean surfaces, our results predict
the rate-limiting step for both materials to be the formation of the *OOH
intermediate, with a larger overpotential for the oxide than the oxynitride
(1.30 V vs 1.01 V). The Na site is found to be more active than the Ta site on
the oxide surface with an OER overpotential of 0.88 V, whereas the OER at the
Sr site on the oxynitride has an overpotential of 1.14 V. For the A sites,
contrary to the Ta site, the deprotonation of *OH was found to be the
rate-limiting step. Computed Pourbaix diagrams show that at relevant
(photo)electrochemical conditions all surfaces are covered with oxygen
adsorbates. Oxygen adsorbates at A (Na, Sr) sites are however found to couple
and desorb as O$_2$, leaving these sites empty under typical operating
conditions. Following this desorption, we find the OER to proceed by the
conventional *OOH mechanism on the SrO termination of the oxynitride but by a
direct coupling of neighbouring *O at Na sites on the oxide surface. This
coupling mechanism on the oxide has the smallest overpotential of 0.79 V
compared to 0.88 V for the oxynitride, implying that the oxide is a better OER
catalyst.

from DNS of incompressible channel flows at $Re_\tau$ up to 5200. Each term in
the transport equation has been spectrally decomposed to expose the
contribution of turbulence at different length scales to the processes
governing the flow of energy in the wall-normal direction, in scale and among
components.
  The outer-layer turbulence is dominated by very large-scale streamwise
elongated modes. Away from the wall, production occurs primarily in these
large-scale streamwise-elongated modes in the streamwise velocity, but
dissipation occurs nearly isotropically in both velocity components and scale.
For this to happen, the energy is transferred from the streamwise elongated
modes to modes with a range of orientations through non-linear interactions,
and then transferred to other velocity components. This allows energy to be
transferred more-or-less isotropically from these large scales to the small
scales at which dissipation occurs. The VLSMs also transfer energy to the
wall-region resulting in a modulation of the autonomous near-wall dynamics.
  The near-wall energy flows are consistent with the well-known autonomous
near-wall dynamics. Through the overlap region between outer and inner layer
turbulence, there is a self-similar structure to the energy flows. The VLSM
production occurs at spanwise scales that grow with $y$. There is transport of
energy away from the wall over a range of scales that grows with $y$. And,
there is transfer of energy to small dissipative scales which grow like
$y^{1/4}$. Finally, the small-scale near-wall processes characterised by
wavelengths less than 1000 wall units are largely Reynolds number independent,
while the larger-scale outer layer process are strongly Reynolds number
dependent. The interaction between them appears to be relatively simple.

compute infrastructure that routinely face a number of unavailabilities such as

adverse effects of such unavailabilities. A code consists of an encoding
function that proactively introduces redundant computation and a decoding
function that reconstructs unavailable outputs using the available ones. Past
work focuses on using codes to provide resilience for linear computations and
specific iterative optimization algorithms. However, computations performed for
a variety of applications including inference on state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms, such as neural networks, typically fall outside this
realm. In this paper, we propose taking a learning-based approach to designing
codes that can handle non-linear computations. We present carefully designed
neural network architectures and a training methodology for learning encoding

computation results. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating
the effectiveness of the proposed approach: we show that the our learned codes
can accurately reconstruct $64 - 98\%$ of the unavailable predictions from
neural-network based image classifiers on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and

major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and
decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute
resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many
defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much
different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular,
generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from
infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.
  The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We
argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to
achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and
computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature
and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between
""hand-engineering"" and ""end-to-end"" learning, and instead advocate for an
approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how
using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can
facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We
present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational
inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various
approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a
straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing
structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational
reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more
sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a
companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for
building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.

spectroscopy. These interaction and disorder effects can be incorporated into a
mean-field description by means of a self-energy appearing in the Green's
function. We first examine the quasiparticle scattering interference spectra in
the superconducting state at optimal doping as temperature is increased.
Assuming agreement with angle-resolved photoemission experiments which suggest
that the scattering rate depends on temperature, resulting in the filling of
the $d$-wave gap, we find that the peaks predicted by the octet model become
progressively smeared as temperature is increased. When the scattering rate is
of the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap, the spectral
function shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local
density of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks. We next
consider the normal state properties of the optimally-doped cuprates. We model
this by adding a marginal Fermi liquid self-energy to the normal-state
propagator, and consider the dependence of the QPI spectra on frequency,
temperature, and doping. We demonstrate that the MFL self-energy leads to a
smearing of the caustics appearing in the normal-state QPI power spectrum as
either temperature or frequency is increased at fixed doping. The smearing is
found to be more prominent in the MFL case than in an ordinary Fermi liquid. We
also consider the case of a marginal Fermi liquid with a strongly
momentum-dependent self-energy which gives rise to a visible ""nodal-antinodal""
dichotomy at the normal state, and discuss how the spectra as seen in ARPES and

qubit-based models and connect the error probabilities defining these models to
parameters of the physical system. Using these models, we compute
pseudo-thresholds for the $d=5$ Bacon-Shor subsystem code. Our results
emphasize the importance of correlated errors induced in multi-qubit
measurements. Moreover, we find that for sufficiently fast quasiparticle
relaxation the errors are well described by Pauli operators. This work bridges
the divide between physical errors in Majorana-based quantum computing
architectures and the significance of these errors in a quantum error
correcting code.

state. While there exist well defined spin wave excitations at high magnetic
fields, the one magnon modes and the two magnon continuum start to strongly
overlap upon decreasing the field, and eventually they become the scattering
continuum at zero field. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the
possible emergence of a magnetically ordered ground state with fractionalized
excitations in the spin model with the exchange parameters determined from two
previous experiments. Using the fermionic parton mean field theory, we show
that the magnetically ordered state with fractionalized excitations can arise
as a stable mean field ground state in the presence of sufficiently strong
quantum fluctuations. The spin excitation spectrum in such a ground state is
computed and shown to have the scattering continuum. Upon increasing the
magnetic field, the fractionalized magnetically ordered state is suppressed,
and is eventually replaced by the conventional magnetically ordered phase at
high fields, which is consistent with the experimental data. We discuss further

of stellar masses -- the stellar initial mass function -- in order to
extrapolate from the star-formation rate measured for typically rare, massive
stars (> 8 Msun) to the total star-formation rate across the full stellar mass
spectrum. The shape of the stellar initial mass function in various galaxy
populations underpins our understanding of the formation and evolution of
galaxies across cosmic time. Classical determinations of the stellar initial
mass function in local galaxies are traditionally made at ultraviolet, optical
and near-infrared wavelengths, which cannot be probed in dust-obscured
galaxies, especially in distant starbursts, whose apparent star-formation rates
are hundreds to thousands of times higher than in our Milky Way, selected at
submillimetre (rest-frame far-infrared) wavelengths. The 13C/18O abundance
ratio in the cold molecular gas -- which can be probed via the rotational
transitions of the 13CO and C18O isotopologues -- is a very sensitive index of
the stellar initial mass function, with its determination immune to the
pernicious effects of dust. Here we report observations of 13CO and C18O
emission for a sample of four dust-enshrouded starbursts at redshifts of
approximately two to three, and find unambiguous evidence for a top-heavy
stellar initial mass function in all of them. A low 13CO/C18O ratio for all our
targets -- alongside a well-tested, detailed chemical evolution model
benchmarked on the Milky Way -- implies that there are considerably more
massive stars in starburst events than in ordinary star-forming spiral
galaxies. This can bring these extraordinary starbursts closer to the `main
sequence' of star-forming galaxies, though such main-sequence galaxies may not
be immune to changes in initial stellar mass function, depending upon their

unique opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments

stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with

histories in much higher mass systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows
that coexist with a low entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member
galaxies are substantially quenched compared to the field down to dwarf galaxy
masses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence on mass or
distance from the cluster center. This enhanced quenched population extends
beyond $R_{200}$ and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that
SMBH activity is significantly suppressed within clusters outside of the BCG,

through the inner Solar system as the Sun's energy sublimates ices and
liberates surface material, generating beautiful comae, dust, and ion tails.
Comets are also thought to orbit other stars, and are the most promising
interpretation of sporadic absorption features (i.e. transits) seen in spectra
of stars such as $\beta$ Pictoris and 49 Ceti. These `exocomets' are thought to
form and evolve in the same way as in the Solar system, and as in the Solar
system we may gain insight into their origins by deriving their orbits. In the
case of $\beta$ Pictoris, orbits have been estimated indirectly, using the
radial velocity of the absorption features coupled with a physical evaporation
model to estimate the stellocentric distance at transit $d_{\rm tr}$. Here, we
note that the inferred $d_{\rm tr}$ imply that some absorption signatures
should accelerate over several hours, and show that this acceleration is indeed
seen in HARPS spectra. This new constraint means that orbital characteristics
can be obtained directly, and the pericentre distance and longitude constrained
when parabolic orbits are assumed. The results from fitting orbits to 12
accelerating features, and a handful of non-accelerating ones, are in broad
agreement with previous estimates based on an evaporation model, thereby
providing some validation of the exocomet hypothesis. A prediction of the
evaporation model, that coma absorption is deeper for more distant transits, is
also seen here.

from previous studies, which concluded that for low upstream densities CO

arbitrary upstream values will support a detonation wave of the CJ type. Using
this argument, we are able to show that CO detonations are pathological and to
verify that He detonations are of the CJ type, as was previously claimed for
He. Our analysis of the reactions that control the approach to nuclear

around nearby stars arising from exozodiacal dust. Here we investigate how the
process of inward scattering of comets originating in an outer belt, is
affected by the architecture of a planetary system, to determine whether this
could lead to observable exozodi levels or deliver volatiles to inner planets.
Using N-body simulations, we model systems with different planet mass and
orbital spacing distributions in the 1-50 AU region. We find that tightly
packed ($\Delta a_\mathrm{p}<20 R_\mathrm{Hill,m}$) low mass planets are the
most efficient at delivering material to exozodi regions (5-7% of scattered
exocomets end up within 0.5 AU at some point), although the exozodi levels do
not vary by more than a factor of ~7 for the architectures studied here. We
suggest that emission from scattered dusty material in between the planets
could provide a potential test for this delivery mechanism. We show that the
surface density of scattered material can vary by two orders of magnitude
(being highest for systems of low mass planets with medium spacing), whilst the
exozodi delivery rate stays roughly constant, and that future instruments such
as JWST could detect it. In fact for $\eta$ Corvi, the current Herschel upper
limit rules out the scattering scenario by a chain of $\lesssim$30 M$_\oplus$
planets. Finally, we show that exocomets could be efficient at delivering
cometary material to inner planets (0.1-1% of scattered comets are accreted per
inner planet). Overall, the best systems at delivering comets to inner planets
are the ones that have low mass outer planets and medium spacing ($\sim20

a primary target of future CMB experiments. Measurements of the kSZ effect have
the potential to address fundamental questions about the structure and
evolution of our Universe on the largest scales and at the earliest times. This
potential is unlocked by combining measurements of small-scale CMB anisotropies
with large-scale structure surveys, a technique known as kSZ tomography.
Previous work established a quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field,
the CMB dipole observed at different locations in the Universe. This previous
work did not include gravitational lensing, redshift space distortions, or
non-linear evolution of structure. In this paper, we investigate how well the
remote dipole field can be reconstructed in the presence of such effects by
using mock data from a suite of simulations. To properly model both large and
small scales, we develop a novel box-in-box simulation pipeline, where
small-scale information is obtained from N-body simulations, and large-scale
information obtained by evolving fields using linear theory and adding the
resulting corrections to the N-body particle data. This pipeline allows us to
create properly correlated maps of the primary CMB including lensing, as well
as the kSZ effect and density maps on the past light cone of an observer.
Analyzing an ensemble of mocks, we find that the dipole field can be
reconstructed with high fidelity over a range of angular scales and redshift
bins, although there is evidence of excess power from nonlinear structure. We
also analyze correlations with the primary CMB, investigating the ability of
kSZ tomography to reconstruct the intrinsic CMB dipole. Our results constitute
a proof-of-principle that kSZ tomography is a promising technique for future
datasets.

Andreev bound state regime is characterized by strong features in the tunneling
spectra creating a ""gap closure"" signature, but no ""gap reopening"" signature

the coming together of the Andreev bound states at high chemical potential

transition. Our theoretical finding establishes the generic intrinsic Andreev
bound states on the trivial side of the topological quantum phase transition as
the main contributors to the tunneling conductance spectra, providing a generic
interpretation of existing experiments in clean Majorana nanowires. Our work
also explains why experimental tunnel conductance spectra generically have gap

nebulae around early-type stars. If they exist over a wide range of stellar
properties, one possible overarching explanation is non-conservative mass
transfer in binary interactions, or stellar mergers. For ~3850 stars (all OBA
stars in the Bright Star Catalogue [BSC], Be stars, BeXRBs, and Be+sdO
systems), we visually inspect WISE 22 $\mu$m images. Based on nebular shape and
relative position, we distinguish five categories: offset bow shocks
structurally aligned with the stellar space velocity, unaligned offset bow
shocks, and centered, unresolved, and not classified nebulae. In the BSC, we
find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess
associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs,
and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae. Aligned or unaligned
bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar
medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13%
of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the
rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova
remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The
existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits
the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass
loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at
least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all
OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary
evolution.

minihalo ($z\sim 10\hbox{--}20$, M$\sim 10^5\hbox{--}10^7$ M$_\odot$),and put
an upper limit on the diffusion coefficient $D\le 1\times 10^{26}$ cm$^2$

of $D$, our results suggest uniform heating by CR at high redshift, although
there are uncertainties in magnetic field and other CR parameters. We also
discuss two cases with continuous star formation, one in which the star
formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy is high enough to make the IGM in the vicinity
photoionized, and another in which the SFR is low enough to keep it neutral but
high enough to cause significant heating by cosmic ray protons. In the neutral
case (low SFR), we find that the resulting heating can make the gas hotter than
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation for $D < 10^{30}$ cm$^2$

future radio observations. In the case of photoionized IGM (high SFR), the

neutral gas properties such as metallicity, HI column density and dust
depletion, however the relative velocity of NV, typically a blueshift with
respect to the neutral gas, is found to be correlated with the column density
of HI. This may be explained if the NV gas is part of an HII region hosting the
GRB, where the region's expansion is confined by dense, neutral gas in the
GRB's host galaxy. We find tentative evidence (at 2-sigma significance) that
the X-ray derived column density, N_H,X, may be correlated with the column
density of NV, which would indicate that both measurements are sensitive to the
column density of the gas located in the vicinity of the GRB. We investigate

generally, the jumps are suggested to take place in an operator space-time in

We compare the results with those from a large sample of HI column densities

column density corrections are significantly lower than those inferred by the
Planck-based model. Further, we rule out the hypothesis that the pencil-beam HI
absorption sight lines preferentially miss opaque ""blobs"" with small covering
fraction, as these structures require densities and pressures which are
incompatible with ISM conditions. Our results support the picture that excess
dust emission in the local ISM is not dominated by optically-thick HI, but is
rather a combination of intrinsic changes in dust grain emissivities and H2

application of quantum chemistry simulation on near-term quantum devices, we
envision a hybrid quantum--classical framework for leveraging problem
decomposition (PD) techniques in quantum chemistry. Specifically, we use PD
techniques to decompose a target molecular system into smaller subsystems
requiring fewer computational resources. In our framework, there are two levels
of hybridization. At the first level, we use a classical algorithm to decompose
a target molecule into subsystems, and utilize a quantum algorithm to simulate
the quantum nature of the subsystems. The second level is in the quantum
algorithm. We consider the quantum--classical variational algorithm that
iterates between an expectation estimation using a quantum device and a
parameter optimization using a classical device. We investigate three popular
PD techniques for our hybrid approach: the fragment molecular-orbital (FMO)
method, the divide-and-conquer (DC) technique, and the density matrix embedding
theory (DMET). We examine the efficacy of these techniques in correctly
differentiating conformations of simple alkane molecules. In particular, we
consider the ratio between the number of qubits for PD and that of the full
system; the mean absolute deviation; and the Pearson correlation coefficient
and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Sampling error is introduced when
expectation values are measured on the quantum device. Therefore, we study how
this error affects the predictive performance of PD techniques. The present
study is our first step to opening up the possibility of using quantum

industry on near-term quantum hardware.

represents the largest sample of UCMG candidates assembled to date over the
largest sky area. In this paper we present the first effort to obtain their
redshifts using different facilities, starting with first results for 28
candidates with redshifts $z < 0.5$, obtained at NTT and TNG telescopes. We
confirmed, as bona fide UCMGs, 19 out of the 28 candidates with new redshifts.
A further 46 UCMG candidates are confirmed with literature spectroscopic
redshifts (35 at $z < 0.5$), bringing the final cumulative sample of
spectroscopically-confirmed lower-z UCMGs to 54 galaxies, which is the largest
sample at redshifts below $0.5$. We use these spectroscopic redshifts to
quantify systematic errors in our photometric selection, and use these to
correct our UCMG number counts. We finally compare the results to independent
datasets and simulations.

interacting oscillators, has been used and generalized for a wide range of
applications involving the collective behavior of large heterogeneous groups of
dynamical units whose states are characterized by a scalar angle variable. One
such application in which we are interested is the alignment of orientation
vectors among members of a swarm. Despite being commonly used for this purpose,
the Kuramoto model can only describe swarms in 2 dimensions, and hence the
results obtained do not apply to the often relevant situation of swarms in 3
dimensions. Partly based on this motivation, as well as on relevance to the
classical, mean-field, zero-temperature Heisenberg model with quenched site
disorder, in this paper we study the Kuramoto model generalized to $D$
dimensions. We show that in the important case of 3 dimensions, as well as for
any odd number of dimensions, the $D$-dimensional generalized Kuramoto model
for heterogeneous units has dynamics that are remarkably different from the
dynamics in 2 dimensions. In particular, for odd $D$ the transition to
coherence occurs discontinuously as the inter-unit coupling constant $K$ is
increased through zero, as opposed to the $D=2$ case (and, as we show, also the
case of even $D$) for which the transition to coherence occurs continuously as
$K$ increases through a positive critical value $K_c$. We also demonstrate the
qualitative applicability of our results to related models constructed

potential usage of the derived statistics in learning strategies. First, small

and the field rotation from ELT-M4-M5 induce distortions and PSF jitter at the
edge of 1 arcmin FoV (radius 35 arcsec) up to $\sim$ 5 mas comparable to the
diffraction-limited PSF size $FWHM_H = 8.5$ mas. The RMS distortions inherent
to the ELT design are confined to the 1$^{st}$-3$^{rd}$ order and reduce to an
astrometric RMS residual post fit of $\sim$ 10-20 $\mu as$ for higher order
terms. In this paper, we study which calibration effort has to be undertaken to
reach an astrometric stability close to this level of higher order residuals.
The amplitude and timescales of the assumed telescope tolerances indicate the
need for frequent on-sky calibrations and MCAO stabilization of the plate scale
to enable astrometric observations with ELT at the level of $\leq 50 \mu as$,
which is one of the core science missions for the ELT / MICADO instrument.

The former corresponds to emission from AGN-heated dust only, whereas the
latter includes emission from dust heated by stars and AGN. Our results show
that the two luminosity functions are substantially different below 10^13 Lsun

feature and object detection in images since it provides information about
their objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic
analysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot
be used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image
segmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding
by simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there
is currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges
cannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The
objective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that
allows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial
contours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that
uses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the
required probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous
space of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap
between the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed
method is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities
and its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based
estimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take
into consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This
is the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability
based on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such
as image segmentation and contour completion.

processes. Off-policy evaluation is the task of evaluating the expected return
of one policy with data generated by a different, behavior policy. Importance
sampling is a technique for off-policy evaluation that re-weights off-policy
returns to account for differences in the likelihood of the returns between the
two policies. In this paper, we study importance sampling with an estimated
behavior policy where the behavior policy estimate comes from the same set of
data used to compute the importance sampling estimate. We find that this
estimator often lowers the mean squared error of off-policy evaluation compared
to importance sampling with the true behavior policy or using a behavior policy
that is estimated from a separate data set. Intuitively, estimating the
behavior policy in this way corrects for error due to sampling in the
action-space. Our empirical results also extend to other popular variants of
importance sampling and show that estimating a non-Markovian behavior policy

resolution spectroscopy that combines a fiber-laser cavity with a
microresonator. Although the spectral resolution of a chip-based comb source is
typically limited by the free spectral range (FSR) of the microresonator, we
overcome this limit by tuning the 200-GHz repetition-rate comb over one FSR via
control of an integrated heater. Our dual-cavity scheme allows for
self-starting comb generation without the need for conventional pump-cavity
detuning while achieving a spectral resolution equal to the comb linewidth. We
measure broadband molecular absorption spectra of acetylene by interleaving 800
spectra taken at 250-MHz per spectral step using a 60-GHz-coarse-resolution
spectrometer and exploits advances of integrated heater which can locally and
rapidly change the refractive index of a microresonator with low electrical
consumption (0.9 GHz/mW), which is orders of magnitude lower than a fiber-based
comb. This approach offers a path towards a simple, robust and low-power
consumption CMOS-compatible platform capable of remote sensing.

in high interaction rate causing the data acquisition rate to exceed 3 TB/sec.
In order to acquire data for all the events and to handle the increased data
rate, a transition in the readout electronics architecture from the triggered
to the trigger-less acquisition mode is required. In this new architecture, a
dedicated electronics block called the Common Readout Unit (CRU) is defined to
act as a nodal communication point for detector data aggregation and as a
distribution point for timing, trigger and control (TTC) information. TTC
information in the upgraded triggerless readout architecture uses two
asynchronous high-speed serial links connections: the TTC-PON and the GBT. We
have carried out a study to evaluate the quality of the embedded timing signals
forwarded by the CRU to the connected electronics using the TTC-PON and GBT
bridge connection. We have used four performance metrics to characterize the
communication bridge: (a)the latency added by the firmware logic, (b)the jitter
cleaning effect of the PLL on the timing signal, (c)BER analysis for
quantitative measurement of signal quality, and (d)the effect of optical
transceivers parameter settings on the signal strength. Reliability study of
the bridge connection in maintaining the phase consistency of timing signals is
conducted by performing multiple iterations of power on/off cycle, firmware
upgrade and reset assertion/de-assertion cycle (PFR cycle). The test results
are presented and discussed concerning the performance of the TTC-PON and GBT

perturbations and show that (1) has a deterministic spreading speed interval
$[2\sqrt{\underline a}, 2\sqrt{\bar a}]$, where $\underline{a}$ and $\bar a$

a$ is the average of $a(\cdot)$. Under some assumption on $a_0(\cdot)$, we also
show that the constant solution $u=1$ of (2) is asymptotically stably and (2)
admits a bounded spreading speed interval.
  It is not assumed that $a(\omega)$ and $a_0(t)$ are bounded above and below
by some positive constants. The results obtained in this part are new and

one could better understand the complexity of each task, as well as potentially
find smaller policy representations that are easier for humans to understand

policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for
policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are

Vector Quantization makes the encoder capable of growing its dictionary size
over time, to address new observations as they appear in an open-ended
online-learning context; Direct Residuals Sparse Coding encodes observations by
disregarding reconstruction error minimization, and aiming instead for highest
information inclusion. The encoder autonomously selects observations online to
train on, in order to maximize code sparsity. As the dictionary size increases,
the encoder produces increasingly larger inputs for the neural network: this is
addressed by a variation of the Exponential Natural Evolution Strategies
algorithm which adapts its probability distribution dimensionality along the
run. We test our system on a selection of Atari games using tiny neural
networks of only 6 to 18 neurons (depending on the game's controls). These are
still capable of achieving results comparable---and occasionally superior---to

characterize the publication landscape of approaches that handle security

mapping to outline relevant work and contemporary gaps for future research.
[Results] In total, we identified 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria,
dated from 2005 to 2017. We found that the approaches typically involve
modifying agile methods, introducing new artifacts (e.g., extending the concept

that more effort needs to be invested into empirically evaluating the existing

understand the behaviour of real-time systems during overload conditions. While
competitive analysis provides insight into the behaviour of certain algorithms,
it is hard to make inferences about the performance of those algorithms in
practice. Other approaches to dealing with overload resort to heuristics that
seem to perform well but are hard to prove as being good. Further, most work on
handling overload in real-time systems does not consider using information
regarding the distribution of arrival rates of jobs and execution times to make
scheduling decisions. We present an scheduling policy (obtained through
stochastic approximation, and using information about the workload) to handle
overload in real-time systems and improve the revenue earned when each
successful job completion results in revenue accrual. We prove that the policy
we outline does lead to increased revenue when compared to a class of
scheduling policies that make static resource allocations to different service
classes. We also use empirical evidence to underscore the fact that this policy
performs better than a variety of other scheduling policies. The ideas
presented can be applied to several soft real-time systems, specifically
systems with multiple service classes.

medium and high temperature range. To harness these material properties for
thermoelectric applications, it is important to realize electrical contacts
with low electrical contact resistivity. However, little is known about the
detailed structural and electronic properties of such contacts, and the
expected values of contact resistivity. Here, we employ atomistic ab initio
calculations to study electrical contacts in a subclass of HH alloys consisting
of the compounds HfCoSb, HfZrCoSb, and HfZrNiSn. By using Ag as a prototypical
metal, we show that the termination of the HH material critically determines
the presence or absence of strong deformations at the interface. Our study
includes contacts to doped materials, and the results indicate that the p-type
materials generally form ohmic contacts while the n-type materials have a small
Schottky barrier. We calculate the temperature dependence of the contact
resistivity in the low to medium temperature range and provide quantitative
values that set lower limits for these systems.

The paradigm of topological lasing, realized in three recent experiments,
offers entirely new interpretations of these states, as they can be selectively
amplified by distributed gain and loss. A key question is whether such
topological mode selection persists when one accounts for the nonlinearities
that stabilize such systems at their working point. Here we show that
topological defect lasers can indeed stably operate in genuinely topological
states. These comprise direct analogues of zero modes from the linear setting,
as well as a novel class of states displaying symmetry-protected power
oscillations, which appear in a spectral phase transition when the gain is
increased. These effects show a remarkable practical resilience against
imperfections, even if these break the underlying symmetries, and pave the way
to harness the power of topological protection in nonlinear quantum devices.

either solves such complex equilibrium constraints for two-dimensional grasps,

the number of possible `slip states' (where each contact is labeled as either

provides a convenient method for determining the reception sensitivity from the

described by Hoult et al. [J. Magn. Reson. (1976),24, 71], and can be seen as
being based on the broader Lorentz reciprocity principle, and similar theorems
from antenna theory. One frequent application of the reciprocity principle is
that for a single coil used for both transmission and detection, the transmit
and receive fields can be assumed to be equal. This aspect is also where some
of the conceptual difficulty of applying the theorem may be encountered. For
example, the questions of whether one should use the complex conjugate field
for detection, or whether one should apply the theorem in the rotating frame or
the laboratory frame are often where considerable confusion may arise, and
incorrect results may be derived. We attempt here to provide a helpful
discussion of the application of the reciprocity principle in such a way as to
clarify some of the confounding questions. In particular, we avoid the use of
the `negatively rotating frame', which is frequently mentioned in this context,

Cepheid for which the projection factor is measured. The typical accuracy of
our dynamical masses and radii determinations is 1%. The radii of the six
classical Cepheids follow period--radius relations in the literature. Our very
accurate physical parameter measurements allow us to calculate a purely
empirical, tight period--mass--radius relation that agrees well with
theoretical relations derived from non-canonical models. This empirical
relation is a powerful tool to calculate accurate masses for single Cepheids
for which precise radii can be obtained from Baade--Wesselink-type analyses.
The mass of the type-II Cepheid $\kappa$ Pav, $0.56 \pm 0.08 M_\odot$,
determined using this relation is in a very good agreement with theoretical
predictions. We find large differences between the p-factor values derived for
the Cepheids in our sample. Evidence is presented that a simple
period--p-factor relation shows an intrinsic dispersion, hinting at the
relevance of other parameters, such as the masses, radii, and radial velocity
variation amplitudes. We also find evidence that the systematic blueshift
exhibited by Cepheids, is primarily correlated with their gravity. The
companion star of the Cepheid in the OGLE LMC-CEP-4506 system has a very
similar temperature and luminosity, and is clearly located inside the Cepheid
instability strip, yet it is not pulsating.

The fundamental differences between them are encapsulated in their rotational
symmetries - the spin. Although spin quantization is routinely encountered in
fermionic topological edge states, analogous quantization for bosons has proven
elusive. To this end, we develop the complete electromagnetic continuum theory
characterizing 2+1D topological bosons, taking into account their intrinsic
spin and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that
spatiotemporal dispersion (momentum and frequency dependence of linear
response) captures the matter-mediated interactions between bosons and is a
necessary ingredient for topological phases. We prove that the bulk topology of
these 2+1D phases is manifested in transverse spin-1 quantization of the
photon. From this insight, we predict two unique bosonic phases - one with even
parity $C=\pm 2$ and one with odd $C=\pm 1$. To understand the even parity
phase $C=\pm 2$, we introduce an exactly solvable model utilizing non-local
optical Hall conductivity and reveal a single gapless photon at the edge. This
unidirectional photon is spin-1 helically quantized, immune to backscattering,
defects, and exists at the boundary of the $C=\pm 2$ bosonic phase and any
interface - even vacuum. The contrasting phenomena of transverse quantization
in the bulk, but longitudinal (helical) quantization on the edge is addressed
as the quantum gyro-electric effect (QGEE). We also validate our bosonic
Maxwell theory by direct comparison with the supersymmetric Dirac theory of
fermions. To accelerate the discovery of such bosonic phases, we suggest two
new probes of topological matter with broken time-reversal symmetry:
momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy and cold atom near-field
measurement of non-local optical Hall conductivity.

leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for

spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and
checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on

65% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89% (on a temporal
out-of-sample test set). This proves that, next to the residential population
of an area, the ambient population there is strongly predictive of the area's
crime levels. We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the
predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such
features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults
are already well predicted by the census features. Furthermore, we identify and
discuss top predictive features for the main crime categories. These results
offer valuable insights for those responsible for urban policy or law

maximization (EM) algorithm, but recent work by Koenker & Mizera shows that
modern convex optimization techniques -- in particular, interior point methods
-- are substantially faster and more accurate than EM. Here, we develop a new
solution based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP). It is substantially
faster than the interior point method, and just as accurate. Our approach
combines several ideas: first, it solves a reformulation of the original
problem; second, it uses an SQP approach to make the best use of the expensive
gradient and Hessian computations; third, the SQP iterations are implemented
using an active set method to exploit the sparse nature of the quadratic
subproblems; fourth, it uses accurate low-rank approximations for more

approach in experiments on synthetic data sets as well as a large genetic

extensive usage of feature forwarding mechanisms to integrate information from
multiple scales. Although yielding good results, even deeper architectures and
alternative methods for feature fusion at different resolutions have been
scarcely investigated for medical applications. In this work we propose to
implement segmentation via an encoder-decoder architecture which differs from
any other previously published method since (i) it employs a very deep
architecture based on residual learning and (ii) combines features via a
convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), instead of concatenation or
summation. The intuition is that the memory mechanism implemented by LSTMs can
better integrate features from different scales through a coarse-to-fine
strategy; hence the name Coarse-to-Fine Context Memory (CFCM). We demonstrate
the remarkable advantages of this approach on two datasets: the Montgomery
county lung segmentation dataset, and the EndoVis 2015 challenge dataset for
surgical instrument segmentation.

high-magnetic-field radio pulsar PSR J1119-6127 that occurred on 2016 July 27.
We present the results of a monitoring campaign using the Neil Gehrels Swift
X-ray Telescope, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton. After reaching a peak luminosity of
~300 times the quiescent luminosity, the pulsar's X-ray flux declined by factor
of ~50 on a time scale of several months. The X-ray spectra are well described
by a blackbody and a hard power-law tail. After an initial rapid decline during
the first day of the outburst, we observe the blackbody temperature rising from
kT = 0.9 keV to 1.05 keV during the first two weeks of the outburst, before
cooling to 0.9 keV. During this time, the blackbody radius decreases
monotonically by a factor of ~4 over a span of nearly 200 days. We also report
a heretofore unseen highly pulsed hard X-ray emission component, which fades on
a similar timescale to the soft X-ray flux, as predicted by models of
relaxation of magnetospheric current twists. The previously reported spin-up
glitch which accompanied this outburst was followed by a period of enhanced and
erratic torque, leading to a net spin-down of $\sim3.5\times10^{-4}$ Hz, a
factor of ~24 over-recovery. We suggest that this and other radiatively loud
magnetar-type glitch recoveries are dominated by magnetospheric processes, in
contrast to conventional radio pulsar glitch recoveries which are dominated by
internal physics.

expressions for the ground state internal energy and magnetization, under a
perpendicular electric and magnetic field, taking in consideration the Zeeman
effect. It is found that the MO are sawtooth-like, depending on the change in
the last occupied energy level. This leads us to a classification of the MO
peaks in terms of the Landau level (LL), valley or spin changes. Using this
classification we analyze the MO for different values of the electric field
$E_{z}$. When $E_{z}=0$, the energy levels have a valley degeneracy and the MO
peaks occur only whenever the last energy level changes its LL and/or spin.
When $E_{z}\neq0$, the valley degeneracy is broken and new MO peaks appear,
associated with the valley change in the last energy level. By analyzing the MO
peaks amplitude it is possible to extract information about the Fermi velocity
and the spin-orbit interaction strength. Finally we analyze the MO frequencies,

provides a rich framework for understanding genetic variation between samples

more recent models for coalescence (with or without recombination) can be
described in terms of the so-called phase-type theory, where complicated and
tedious calculations are circumvented by the use of matrices. The application
of phase-type theory consists of describing the stochastic model as a Markov
model by appropriately setting up a state space and calculating the
corresponding intensity and reward matrices. Formulae of interest are then
expressed in terms of these aforementioned matrices. We illustrate this by a
few examples calculating the mean, variance and even higher order moments of
the site frequency spectrum in the multiple merger coalescent models, and by
analysing the mean and variance for the number of segregating sites for
multiple samples in the two-locus ancestral recombination graph. We believe
that phase-type theory has great potential as a tool for analysing probability
models in population genetics. The compact matrix notation is useful for
clarification of current models, in particular their formal manipulation

reduced precision), and can impact the final model's accuracy on unseen data.
Due to a lack of standard evaluation criteria that considers these trade-offs,
it is difficult to directly compare these optimizations. To address this
problem, we recently introduced DAWNBench, a benchmark competition focused on
end-to-end training time to achieve near-state-of-the-art accuracy on an unseen
dataset---a combined metric called time-to-accuracy (TTA). In this work, we
analyze the entries from DAWNBench, which received optimized submissions from
multiple industrial groups, to investigate the behavior of TTA as a metric as
well as trends in the best-performing entries. We show that TTA has a low
coefficient of variation and that models optimized for TTA generalize nearly as
well as those trained using standard methods. Additionally, even though
DAWNBench entries were able to train ImageNet models in under 3 minutes, we
find they still underutilize hardware capabilities such as Tensor Cores.
Furthermore, we find that distributed entries can spend more than half of their

deforming into liquid lenses, droplets with a Hookean membrane (finite
stretching modulus, zero bending modulus) deforming into elastic lenses, to
microcapsules (finite stretching and bending modulus) deforming into rounded

interest in the analysis and design of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.
The vast majority of research in this area is focused on algorithmic
techniques. Most recently, Blake and Lin proposed a computational technique to
count the number of cycles of length $g$ in a bi-regular bipartite graph, where
$g$ is the girth of the graph. The information required for the computation is
the node degree and the multiplicity of the nodes on both sides of the
partition, as well as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph
(graph spectrum). In this paper, the result of Blake and Lin is extended to
compute the number of cycles of length $g+2, \ldots, 2g-2$, for bi-regular
bipartite graphs, as well as the number of $4$-cycles and $6$-cycles in
irregular and half-regular bipartite graphs, with $g \geq 4$ and $g \geq 6$,
respectively.

Here, we
present the study of the physical effect of introduction of finite thickness on
the generation of small-scale spiral arms by swing amplification in a
differentially rotating galactic disk. The galactic disk is modelled first as a
one-fluid system, and then as a gravitationally-coupled two-fluid (stars and
gas) system where each fluid is taken as isothermal, and corotating with each
other. We derived the equations governing the evolution of growth of the
non-axisymmetric perturbations in a sheared frame of reference while
incorporating the effect of finite thickness of a galactic disk. We found that
the finite thickness of a galactic disk has a generic trend of suppressing the
growth of the non-axisymmetric perturbations via swing amplification. Moreover,
even the observed range of disk-thickness values (~ 300-500 pc) can lead to a
complete suppression of swing amplification for Q ~ 1.7, whereas for an
infinitesimally-thin disk, the corresponding critical value is Q ~ 2. For a
two-fluid (stars and gas) system, the net amplification is shown to be set by
the mutual interplay of the effect of interstellar gas in promoting the spiral
features and the effect of finite thickness in preventing the spiral arms. The
coexistence of these two opposite effects is shown to be capable of giving rise
to diverse and complex dynamical behaviour.

approach used to predict unobserved or missing edges between entities. However,
an open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyond
simple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which might
involve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, given
an incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict ""em what
drugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?"" -- a
query that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that {\em might}
interact with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficiently
make predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractable
subset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach,
we embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operators
as learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embedding
space. By performing logical operations within a low-dimensional embedding
space, our approach achieves a time complexity that is linear in the number of
query variables, compared to the exponential complexity required by a naive
enumeration-based approach. We demonstrate the utility of this framework in two
application studies on real-world datasets with millions of relations:
predicting logical relationships in a network of drug-gene-disease interactions
and in a graph-based representation of social interactions derived from a
popular web forum.

and the multi-orbital effects are more prominent than those of electron-doped

different types of hole pockets, namely, one mainly consisting of the almost

of the spin-split upper and lower bands near ${\rm K}$ and ${\rm K}'$ points
arising from the $|d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\rangle$ and $|d_{xy}\rangle$ orbitals. The
number of relevant Fermi pockets increases with increase of the doping. At very
low doping, the upper split bands of $|d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\rangle$ and
$|d_{xy}\rangle$ are concerned, yielding extremely low $T_{\rm c}$ due to small
density of states of the split bands. For further doping, the conventional
spin-singlet state (SS) appears in the $\Gamma$ pocket, which has a mixture of
the spin-triplet (orbital-singlet) (ST-OS) and spin-singlet (orbital-triplet)
(SS-OT) states in the K and K$'$ pockets. The ratio of the mixture depends on
the relative strength of the interactions, and the sign of the exchange
interactions. Moderately strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions even lead
to the pairing state with the dominant ST-OS state over the conventional SS
one. With these observations, we expect that the fascinating pairing with
relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ emerges at high doping that involves all the three

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a small-scale
dynamo on the differential rotation. The solar differential rotation deviates
from the Taylor-Proudman state in which the angular velocity does not change
along the rotational axis. To break the Taylor-Proudman state deep in the
convection zone, it is thought that a latitudinal entropy gradient is required.
In this study, we find that the small-scale dynamo has three roles in the
deviation of the stellar differential rotation from the Taylor-Proudman state.
1. The shear of the angular velocity is suppressed. This leads to a situation
where the latitudinal entropy gradient efficiently breaks the Taylor-Proudman
state. 2. The perturbation of the entropy is increased with suppressing the
turbulent velocity between up- and downflows. 3. The convection velocity is
reduced. This increases the effect of the rotation on the convection. The
second and third factors increase the latitudinal entropy gradient and break
the Taylor-Proudman state. We find that the efficient small-scale dynamo has a
significant impact on the stellar differential rotation.

nonrelativistic uncorrelated particles is derived for general cases of given
distribution functions of single particle velocities. The distribution function
is then used in calculations of thermonuclear reaction rates. As an example, we
take the Tsallis non-Maxwellian distribution, and show that the distribution
function of the relative velocity is different from the Tsallis distribution.
We identify an inconsistency in previous studies of nuclear reaction rates
within Tsallis statistics, and derive revised nuclear reaction rates. Utilizing
the revised rates, accurate results of big bang nucleosynthesis are obtained
for the Tsallis statistics. For this application it is more difficult to reduce
the primordial 7Li abundance while keeping other nuclear abundances within the
observational constraints. A small deviation from a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution can increase the D abundance and slightly reduce 7Li abundance.
Although it is impossible to realize a 7Li abundance at the level observed in
metal-poor stars, a significant decrease is possible while maintaining a
consistency with the observed D abundance.

succinct descriptive models for observed data. In alternative,
interdependencies among $N$ time series $\{ x_{nk}, k>0 \}_{n=1}^{N}$ are
nowadays often captured by a graph or network $G$ that in practice may be very
large. The network itself may change over time as well (i.e., as $G_k$).
Tracking brute force the changes of time varying networks presents major
challenges, including the associated computational problems. Further, a large
set of networks may not lend itself to useful analysis. This paper approximates
the time varying networks $\left\{G_k\right\}$ as weighted linear combinations
of eigennetworks. The eigennetworks are fixed building blocks that are
estimated by first learning the time series of graphs $G_k$ from the data $\{
x_{nk}, k>0 \}_{n=1}^{N}$, followed by a Principal Network Analysis procedure.
The weights of the eigennetwork representation are eigenfeatures and the time
varying networks $\left\{G_k\right\}$ describe a trajectory in eigennetwork
space. These eigentrajectories should be smooth since the networks $G_k$ vary
at a much slower rate than the data $x_{nk}$, except when structural network
shifts occur reflecting potentially an abrupt change in the underlying
application and sources of the data. Algorithms for learning the time series of
graphs $\left\{G_k\right\}$, deriving the eigennetworks, eigenfeatures and
eigentrajectories, and detecting changepoints are presented. Experiments on
simulated data and with two real time series data (a voting record of the US
senate and genetic expression data for the \textit{Drosophila Melanogaster} as
it goes through its life cycle) demonstrate the performance of the learning and
provide interesting interpretations of the eigennetworks.

However, since their genesis, value of information methods have been largely
neglected by statisticians. In this paper we review and extend existing value
of information methods and recommend the use of three quantities for
identifying influential and outlying data: an influence measure previously
suggested by \cite{kempthorne1986}, a related quantity known as the expected
value of sample information that is used to gauge how much influence we would
expect a portion of the data to have, and the ratio of these two quantities
which serves as a comparison between observed influence and expected influence.
  We study the basic theoretical properties of those quantities and illustrate
our proposed approach using two datasets. A data set containing employment

of sublimation from an object as large as Themis. We nonetheless demonstrate
that our observations would have been capable of detecting faint dust emission
as close as 20"" from the object, even in a crowded star field. This approach
could be used to conduct future searches for sublimation-generated dust
emission from Themis or other large asteroids closer to perihelion than was
done in this work. It would also be useful for deep imaging of collisionally

clustering to study (i) the failures of spectral clustering and (ii) the
benefits of regularization. The explanation is simple. Sparse and stochastic
graphs create a lot of small trees that are connected to the core of the graph
by only one edge. Graph conductance is sensitive to these noisy `dangling
sets'. Spectral clustering inherits this sensitivity. The second part of the
paper starts from a previously proposed form of regularized spectral clustering
and shows that it is related to the graph conductance on a `regularized graph'.
We call the conductance on the regularized graph CoreCut. Based upon previous
arguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger
inequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering.
Simple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to small cuts in
the graph. Together, these results show that unbalanced partitions from
spectral clustering can be understood as overfitting to noise in the periphery
of a sparse and stochastic graph. Regularization fixes this overfitting. In
addition to this statistical benefit, these results also demonstrate how
regularization can improve the computational speed of spectral clustering. We
provide simulations and data examples to illustrate these results.

this behavior confuses attempts for extracting the routing information from the

allowing us to use a breadth-first search that finds the vertices positions on
the torus. The positions are pairs of integer numbers that provides routing
information to a greedy routing algorithm that finds small paths of the

the background of a global monopole. Due to the nontrivial topology of the
global monopole spacetime, characterized by a solid deficit angle parametrized
by $\eta^2$, we expect that $\left<\hat{\Psi}^2\right>_{\text{ren}}$ and
$\left<\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}\right>_{\text{ren}}$ are nonzero and proportional to
$\eta^2$, so that they annul in the Minkowski limit $\eta\to0$. However, due to
the naked singularity at the monopole core, the evolution of the scalar field
is not unique. In fact, they are in one to one correspondence with the boundary
conditions which turn into self-adjoint the spatial part of the wave operator.
We show that only Dirichlet boundary condition corresponds to our expectations
and gives zero contribution to the vacuum fluctuations in Minkowski limit. All
other boundary conditions give nonzero contributions in this limit due to the
nontrivial interaction between the field and the singularity.

chemical properties of the hot interstellar medium, as well as its content, in
nearby galaxies. Although resonant line scattering complicates the
interpretation of the emission, it also offers an opportunity to measure the
kinematics of the medium. We have implemented a direct Monte Carlo simulation
scheme that enables us to account for resonant scattering effect in the medium,
in principle, with arbitrary spatial, thermal, chemical, and kinematic
distributions. Here we apply this scheme via dimensionless calculation to an
isothermal, chemically uniform, and spherically symmetric medium with a radial
density distribution characterized by a $\beta$-model. This application
simultaneously account for both optical depth-dependent spatial distortion and
intensity change of the resonant line emission due to the scattering,
consistent with previous calculations. We further apply the modeling scheme to
the OVII and OVIII emission line complex observed in the XMM-Newton RGS
spectrum of the M31 bulge. This modeling, though with various limitations due
to its simplicity, shows that the resonant scattering could indeed account for
much of the spatial distortion of the emission, as well as the relative
strengths of the lines, especially the large forbidden to resonant line ratio
of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet. We estimate the isotropic turbulence Mach
number of the medium in M31 as $\sim0.17$ for the first time and the
line-emitting gas temperature as $\sim2.3\times10^6$ K. We conclude that the
resonant scattering may in general play an important role in shaping the soft
X-ray spectra of diffuse hot gas in normal galaxies.

domain is a problem of broad interest in science and engineering and is
commonly referred to as super-resolution. In many cases, however, Fourier
domain may not be the natural choice. For example, in holography, low-pass
projections of sparse signals are obtained in the Fresnel domain. Similarly,
time-varying system identification relies on low-pass projections on the space
of linear frequency modulated signals. In this paper, we study the recovery of
sparse signals from low-pass projections in the Special Affine Fourier
Transform domain (SAFT). The SAFT parametrically generalizes a number of well
known unitary transformations that are used in signal processing and optics. In
analogy to the Shannon's sampling framework, we specify sampling theorems for
recovery of sparse signals considering three specific cases: (1) sampling with
arbitrary, bandlimited kernels, (2) sampling with smooth, time-limited kernels
and, (3) recovery from Gabor transform measurements linked with the SAFT
domain. Our work offers a unifying perspective on the sparse sampling problem
which is compatible with the Fourier, Fresnel and Fractional Fourier domain
based results. In deriving our results, we introduce the SAFT series (analogous
to the Fourier series) and the short time SAFT, and study convolution theorems

recently been research efforts that aimed to develop techniques that leverage
compressive sampling to enable compressed wideband spectrum sensing. These
techniques consider homogeneous wideband spectrum where all bands are assumed
to have similar PU traffic characteristics. In practice, however, wideband
spectrum is not homogeneous, in that different spectrum bands could have
different PU occupancy patterns. In fact, the nature of spectrum assignment, in
which applications of similar types are often assigned bands within the same
block, dictates that wideband spectrum is indeed heterogeneous, as different
application types exhibit different behaviors. In this paper, we consider
heterogeneous wideband spectrum, where we exploit this inherent, block-like
structure of wideband spectrum to design efficient compressive spectrum sensing
techniques that are well suited for heterogeneous wideband spectrum. We propose
a weighted $\ell_1$-minimization sensing information recovery algorithm that
achieves more stable recovery than that achieved by existing approaches while
accounting for the variations of spectrum occupancy across both the time and
frequency dimensions. Through intensive numerical simulations, we show that our
approach achieves better performance when compared to the state-of-the-art

Intra-Cluster Light (ICL) by means of a semi-analytic model. We assume that the
ICL forms by stellar stripping of satellite galaxies and violent processes
during mergers, and implement two independent models: (1) one considers both
mergers and stellar stripping (named {\small STANDARD} model), and one
considers only mergers (named {\small MERGERS} model). We find that BCGs and
ICL form, grow and overall evolve at different times and with different
timescales, but they show a clear co-evolution after redshift $z \sim 0.7-0.8$.
Around 90\% of the ICL from stellar stripping is built-up in the innermost 150
Kpc from the halo centre and the dominant contribution comes from disk-like
galaxies (B/T$<$0.4) through a large number of small/intermediate stripping
events ($M_{strip}/M_{sat}<0.3$). The fractions of stellar mass in BCGs and in
ICL over the total stellar mass within the virial radius of the halo evolve
differently with time. At high redshift, the BCG accounts for the bulk of the
mass, but its contribution gradually decreases with time and stays constant
after $z\sim 0.4-0.5$. The ICL, instead, grows very fast and its contribution
keeps increasing down to the present time. The {\small STANDARD} and the
{\small MERGERS} models make very similar predictions in most of the cases, but
predict different amounts of ICL associated to other galaxies within the virial
radius of the group/cluster other than the BCG, at $z=0$. We then suggest that
this quantity is a valid observable that can shed light on the relative
importance of mergers and stellar stripping for the formation of the ICL.

operator in the bosonic sector of the theory, avoiding so undesirable

exponent, as reported in the literature. The consistency of the proposed model

in the canonical formalism. This component-field Lifshitz-Wess-Zumino model is
in addition rephrased in the Lifshitz superspace, a natural modification of the
conventional one. The one-loop effective potential is computed to study the
possibility of symmetry breaking. It is found that supersymmetry remains intact
at one-loop order, while the U(1) phase symmetry suffers a spontaneous
breakdown above the critical value of the renormalization point. By
renormalizing the one-loop effective potential within the cutoff regularization
scheme, it is observed an improvement of the UV behavior of the theory compared
with the relativistic Wess-Zumino model.

physical attention that helps the model to learn where to look in a large scene
and extract the most salient parts of the image relevant to the path. Whereas,
the social attention component aggregates information across the different
agent interactions and extracts the most important trajectory information from
the surrounding neighbors. SoPhie also takes advantage of GAN to generates more
realistic samples and to capture the uncertain nature of the future paths by
modeling its distribution. All these mechanisms enable our approach to predict

leads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities
numerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends
on both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the
cell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug
concentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for
a cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The
concentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us
to compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at
much finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to
produce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture
of the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,
leak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different
individuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through
bootstrapping to simulate error. While the usual data-driven model with
Sigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters, our mechanistic model only has two
free parameters, allowing it to be open to scrutiny rather than forcing
agreement with data. Even so, the simplest model in our framework, derived

design two dynamic routing policies to aggregate the outputs of RNN/CNN

compress the adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Our algorithms are
based on finding patterns within the adjacency matrix data, and replacing the

lossless compression of graphs. Based on the experimental results, it is

of duality developed by De Haro: which is illustrated here with several
examples, from both elementary physics and string theory. Thus I argue that in

is radiated away at approximately the same cooperative rate that scales with

lineshape with overall amplitude scaling with the ensemble size. If QEs are

scales linearly with the number of excited QEs, consistent with the experiment,
and can be tuned in a wide range by varying the excitation power. For QEs
distributed in an extended region saturating the plasmon mode volume, we show
that the cooperative Purcell factor has universal form independent of the

weak-coupling approaches. The experimental fluctuation spectrum up to 80 meV is
confirmed by theory. Furthermore, the peak at ${\bf Q}_i$ is shown to carry
nearly equal contributions from each of the Ru$(4d)$-$t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbitals,
pointing to a cooperative effect resulting in the dominant spin fluctuations.

  features under different working conditions","Fault diagnosis; Vibration signal; Domain adaptation; Transferable
  features",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bearing failure is the most common failure mode in rotating machinery and can
result in large financial losses or even casualties. However, complex
structures around bearing and actual variable working conditions can lead to
large distribution difference of vibration signal between a training set and a
test set, which causes the accuracy-dropping problem of fault diagnosis. Thus,
how to improve efficiently the performance of bearing fault diagnosis under
different working conditions is always a primary challenge. In this paper, a
novel bearing fault diagnosis under different working conditions method is
proposed based on domain adaptation using transferable features(DATF). The
dataset of normal bearing and faulty bearings are obtained through the fast
Fourier transformation(FFT) of raw vibration signals under different motor
speeds and load conditions. Then we reduce marginal and conditional
distributions simultaneously across domains based on maximum mean
discrepancy(MMD) in feature space by refining pseudo test labels, which can be
obtained by the Nearest-Neighbor(NN) classifier built on training data, and
then a robust transferable feature representation for training and test domains
is achieved after several iterations. With the help of the NN classifier
trained on transferable features, bearing fault categories are identified
accurately in final. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed method
under different working conditions can identify the bearing faults accurately
and outperforms obviously competitive approaches.

  Projections of the Total Fertility Rate for All Countries",,,"10.1214/19-aoas1294",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the 1940s, population projections have in most cases been produced
using the deterministic cohort component method. However, in 2015, for the
first time, in a major advance, the United Nations issued official
probabilistic population projections for all countries based on Bayesian
hierarchical models for total fertility and life expectancy. The estimates of
these models and the resulting projections are conditional on the UN's official
estimates of past values. However, these past values are themselves uncertain,
particularly for the majority of the world's countries that do not have
longstanding high-quality vital registration systems, when they rely on surveys
and censuses with their own biases and measurement errors. This paper is a
first attempt to remedy this for total fertility rates, by extending the UN
model for the future to take account of uncertainty about past values. This is
done by adding an additional level to the hierarchical model to represent the
multiple data sources, in each case estimating their bias and measurement error
variance. We assess the method by out-of-sample predictive validation. While
the prediction intervals produced by the current method have somewhat less than
nominal coverage, we find that our proposed method achieves close to nominal
coverage. The prediction intervals become wider for countries for which the
estimates of past total fertility rates rely heavily on surveys rather than on
vital registration data.

The concerned bilevel optimization problem has a nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex,

popularity of nonconvex $\ell_p$-regularizer and the usefulness of bilevel
optimization for selecting hyperparameters, algorithms for such bilevel
problems have not been studied because of the difficulty of
$\ell_p$-regularizer.
  Our contribution is the proposal of the first algorithm equipped with a

smoothing-type algorithm for the above mentioned bilevel optimization problems

since optimality conditions are not known for such bilevel optimization
problems so far, new necessary optimality conditions, which are called the
SB-KKT conditions, are derived and it is shown that a sequence generated by the

electronic modes of such superconductors in a magnetic field appears as an
efficient way to realize the nonlinear interaction of light at the level of two
single photons. The essence of the effect is in the fact that the pondermotor
energy is proportional to the ratio of the charge squared to the mass of the
""collective particle"" interacting with radiation, $e^2/m$, and therefore, for a
""particle"" representing a collective motion of many electrons, it scales
linearly-, and its second-order correction quadratically with the number of the

carried out in the field of unmanned underwater vehicles. During the last two
decades, more emphasis on the associated hydrodynamic mechanisms, structural

prominently witnessed in the literature. Considering the importance of the
involved acoustic mechanisms, we focus on the quantification of flow noise
produced by an oscillating hydrofoil here employed as a kinematic model for
fish or its relevant appendages. In our current study, we perform numerical
simulations for flow over an oscillating hydrofoil for a wide range of flow and
kinematic parameters. Using the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) method, we
quantify the flow noise produced by a fish during its swimming for a range of
kinematic and flow parameters including Reynolds number, reduced frequency, and
Strouhal number. We find that the distributions of the sound pressure levels at
the oscillating frequency and its first even harmonic due to the pressure
fluctuations in the fluid domain are dipole-like patterns. The magnitudes of
these sound pressure levels depend on the Reynolds number and Strouhal number,
whereas the direction of their dipole-axes appears to be affected by the
reduced frequency only. Moreover, We also correlate this emission of sound
radiations with the hydrodynamic force coefficients.

difference between two magnetization directions at a fixed potential. The
maximally localized Wannier function can be utilized to construct a compact
Hilbert space of low-lying electron states and interpolate band eigenvalues
with high precession. We combine the force theorem and the Wannier

urban ecosystems where ecological functions are driven by human activities. The
higher frequency of some phenotypes in urban vs rural/wild areas has led to the
assumption that directional selection in urban habitats occurs, which may
thereby favour some behavioural and physiological traits in urban animal
populations compared to rural ones. However, empirical evidence of directional
selection on phenotypic traits in urban areas remains scarce. In this study we
tested whether eumelanin-based colouration could be linked to survival in two
urban populations of the feral pigeon Columba livia. A number of studies in
different cities pointed out a higher frequency of darker individuals in more
urbanised areas compared to rural ones. To investigate whether directional
selection through survival on this highly heritable trait could explain such
patterns, we conducted mark-recapture studies on two populations of feral
pigeons in highly urbanized areas. We predicted that darker coloured
individuals would exhibit higher survival and/or philopatry (integrated into
'local survival') than paler coloured ones. No difference in local survival was
found between adults of different colouration intensities. However, on one
site, we found that darker juveniles had a higher local survival probability
than light ones. Juvenile local survival on that site was also negatively
correlated with the number of chicks born. This suggests the existence of
colour- and/or density-dependent selection processes acting on juvenile feral
pigeons in urban environments, acting through differential mortality and/or
dispersal.

equal-mass stars on a 15.8 d period surrounded by a circumbinary disk. Here, we
analyze DQ Tau's light curves obtained by Kepler K2, the Spitzer Space
Telescope, and ground-based facilities. We observed variability phenomena,
including rotational modulation by stellar spots, brief brightening events due
to stellar flares, long brightening events around periastron due to increased
accretion, and short dips due to brief circumstellar obscuration. The
rotational modulation appears as sinusoidal variation with a period of 3.017 d.
In our model this is caused by extended stellar spots 400 K colder than the
stellar effective temperature. During our 80-day-long monitoring we detected 40
stellar flares with energies up to 1.2$\times$10$^{35}$ erg and duration of a
few hours. The flare profiles closely resemble those in older late-type stars,
and their occurrence does not correlate with either the rotational or the
orbital period. We observe elevated accretion rate up to 5$\times$10$^{-8}
M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ around each periastron. Our Spitzer data suggests that the
increased accretion luminosity heats up the inner part of the circumbinary disk
temporarily by about 100 K. We found an inner disk radius of 0.13 au,
significantly smaller than expected from dynamical modeling of circumbinary
disks. Interestingly, the inner edge of the disk is in corotation with the
binary's orbit. DQ Tau also shows short dips of < 0.1 mag in its light curve,

mining. Fuzzy clustering is a particular method that considers that a data
point can belong to more than one cluster. Fuzzy clustering helps obtain
flexible clusters, as needed in such applications as text categorization. The
performance of a clustering algorithm critically depends on the number of
clusters, and estimating the optimal number of clusters is a challenging task.
Quality indices help estimate the optimal number of clusters. However, there is
no quality index that can obtain an accurate number of clusters for different
datasets. Thence, in this paper, we propose a new cluster quality index
associated with a visual, graph-based solution that helps choose the optimal
number of clusters in fuzzy partitions. Moreover, we validate our theoretical
results through extensive comparison experiments against state-of-the-art
quality indices on a variety of numerical real-world and artificial datasets.

family of slowed down gradient flow equations: $\dot \omega ^{
\varepsilon}\_t=- \varepsilon F'( \omega ^{ \varepsilon}\_t),$ where
$\varepsilon>0$, and (ii) by considering the \emph{accelerations} $\ddot \omega
^{ \varepsilon}\_t$. We shall focus on Wasserstein gradient flows. Our approach
is mainly heuristic. It relies on Otto calculus.A special formulation of the
Schr{\""o}dinger problem consists in minimizing some action on the Wasserstein
space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold subject to fixed initial
and final data. We extend this action minimization problem by replacing the
usual entropy, underlying Schr{\""o}dinger problem, with a general function of
the Wasserstein space. The corresponding minimal cost approaches the squared
Wasserstein distance when some fluctuation parameter tends to zero. We show
heuristically that the solutions satisfy a Newton equation, extending a recent
result of Conforti. The connection with Wasserstein gradient flows is
established and various inequalities, including evolutional variational
inequalities and contraction inequality under curvature-dimension condition,
are derived with a heuristic point of view. As a rigorous result we prove a new
and general contraction inequality for the Schr{\""o}dinger problem under a
Ricci lower bound on a smooth and compact Riemannian manifold.

The frequency domain acceleration search (FDAS) module is an important part of
the SKA1-MID pulsar search engine. To develop for a yet to be finalised
hardware, for cross-discipline interoperability and to achieve fast
prototyping, OpenCL as a high-level FPGA synthesis approach is employed to
create the sub-modules of FDAS. The FT convolution and the harmonic-summing
plus some other minor sub-modules are elements in the FDAS module that have
been well-optimised separately before. In this paper, we explore the design
space of combining well-optimised designs, dealing with the ensuing need to
trade-off and compromise. Pipeline computing is employed to handle multiple
input arrays at high speed. The hardware target is to employ multiple high-end
FPGAs to process the combined FDAS module. The results show interesting
consequences, where the best individual solutions are not necessarily the best
solutions for the speed of a pipeline where FPGA resources and memory bandwidth

the combined FDAS module can achieve up to 2x speedup over implementations

including the Drude correction and the correction due to the Cooperon channel.
It is shown that the Drude correction renormalizes the CME coefficient by a
factor to a finite value that is independent of the system size. Furthemore,
due to an additional momentum expansion involved in deriving the CME
coefficient, the contribution of Cooperon to the CME coefficient is governed by
the quartic momentum term. As a result, in contrast to the weak localization
and weak anti-localization effects observed in the measurement of conductivity
of Dirac fermions, we find that in the limit of zero magnetic field, the CME
coefficients of finite systems manifest the same scaling of localization even
in three dimension. Our results indicate that while the chiral magnetic current
due to slowly oscillating magnetic fields can exist in clean systems, its
observability will be limited by suppression due to short-range disorder in

  for the kriging of large spatial datasets",,,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large spatial datasets are becoming ubiquitous in environmental sciences with
the explosion in the amount of data produced by sensors that monitor and
measure the Earth system. Consequently, the geostatistical analysis of these
data requires adequate methods. Richer datasets lead to more complex modeling
but may also prevent from using classical techniques. Indeed, the kriging
predictor is not straightforwarldly available as it requires the inversion of
the covariance matrix of the data. The challenge of handling such datasets is
therefore to extract the maximum of information they contain while ensuring the
numerical tractability of the associated inference and prediction algorithms.
The different approaches that have been developed in the literature to address
this problem can be classified into two families, both aiming at making the
inversion of the covariance matrix computationally feasible. The covariance
tapering approach circumvents the problem by enforcing the sparsity of the
covariance matrix, making it invertible in a reasonable computation time. The
second available approach assumes a low rank representation of the covariance
function. While both approaches have their drawbacks, we propose a way to
combine them and benefit from their advantages. The covariance model is assumed
to have the form low rank plus sparse. The choice of the basis functions
sustaining the low rank component is data driven and is achieved through a
selection procedure, thus alleviating the computational burden of the low rank
part. This model expresses as a spatial random effects model and the estimation
of the parameters is conducted through a step by step approach treating each
scale separately. The resulting model can account for second order non
stationarity and handle large volumes of data.

radio galaxy NGC 1275 in very-high-energy (VHE, E $>$ 100 GeV) gamma rays with
the MAGIC telescopes. Observations were performed between 2016 September and
2017 February as part of a monitoring program. The brightest outburst with
$\sim1.5$ times the Crab Nebula flux above 100 GeV (C.U.) was observed during
the night between 2016 December 31 and 2017 January 1 (fifty times higher than
the mean previously measured in two observational campaigns between 2009 and
2011). Significant variability of the day-by-day light curve was measured, the
shortest flux-doubling time-scales was found to be of $(611\pm101)$ min. The
combined spectrum of the MAGIC data during the strongest flare state and
simultaneous data from the Fermi-LAT around 2017 January 1 follows a power-law
with an exponential cutoff at the energy $(492\pm35)$ GeV. Simultaneous optical
flux density measurements in the R-band obtained with the KVA telescope are
also presented and the correlation between the optical and gamma-ray emission
is investigated. Due to possible internal pair-production, the fast flux
variability constrains the Doppler factor to values which are inconsistent with
a large viewing angle as observed in the radio band. We investigate different
scenarios for the explanation of fast gamma-ray variability, namely emission
from: magnetospheric gaps, relativistic blobs propagating in the jet
(mini-jets) or external cloud (or star) entering the jet. We find that the only
plausible model to account for the luminosities here observed would be the
production of gamma rays in a magnetospheric gap around the central black hole
only in the eventuality of an enhancement of the magnetic field threading the
hole from its equipartition value with the gas pressure in the accretion flow.

the Stokes flow equations for problems in biological fluid mechanics. A recent
variation of this method incorporates a nearest-neighbor discretization to
improve accuracy and efficiency while maintaining the ease-of-implementation of
the original meshless method. This method contains three sources of numerical
error, the regularization error associated from using the regularized form of
the boundary integral equations (with parameter $\varepsilon$), and two sources
of discretization error associated with the force and quadrature
discretizations (with lengthscales $h_f$ and $h_q$). A key issue to address is
the quadrature error: initial work has not fully explained observed numerical
convergence phenomena. In the present manuscript we construct sharp quadrature
error bounds for the nearest-neighbor discretisation, noting that the error for
a single evaluation of the kernel depends on the smallest distance ($\delta$)
between these discretization sets. The quadrature error bounds are described
for two cases: with disjoint sets ($\delta>0$) being close to linear in $h_q$
and insensitive to $\varepsilon$, and contained sets ($\delta=0$) being
quadratic in $h_q$ with inverse dependence on $\varepsilon$. The practical
implications of these error bounds are discussed with reference to the
condition number of the matrix system for the nearest-neighbor method, with the
analysis revealing that the condition number is insensitive to $\varepsilon$
for disjoint sets, and grows linearly with $\varepsilon$ for contained sets.
Error bounds for the general case ($\delta\geq 0$) are revealed to be
proportional to the sum of the errors for each case.

Analysis of foregrounds and its characteristics is thus of utmost importance.
It is customary to test efficacy of foreground removal techniques using

foreground signal is a Gaussian random field. In this work we test this
assumption by computing the binned bispectrum for the all-sky $408$ MHz map.
This is done by applying different brightness temperature ($T$) thresholds in
order to assess whether the cooler parts of the sky have different

these regions of the sky are ideal for future H{\sc i} intensity mapping

junction, i.e. by increasing the ratio between supercurrent and total junction
volume. We present extensive numerical calculations using quasi-classical Green

can be implemented by combining iso-entropic and iso-phasic processes acting on
the weak-link, thereby engineering the coherent version of thermal machines

thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion; the correction of the mass diffusion

Firstly, the quantized DCT coefficients with same frequency are extracted to
build the new data matrices. Then, considering the direction effect on the
correlation between the adjacent positions in DCT domain, twelve kinds of
high-pass filter templates with different directions are executed and the
translation probability matrix is calculated for each filtered data.
Furthermore, principal component analysis and support vector machine technique
are applied to reduce the feature dimension and train a classifier,

network architectures that bal- ance the super-resolution performance and the

adaptive importance learning scheme for SISR that trains the network with an
easy-to-complex paradigm by dynam- ically updating the importance of image

network training and the importance learning into a joint optimization problem.
With a carefully designed importance penalty function, the importance of
individual pixels can be gradu- ally increased through solving a convex
optimization problem. The training process thus begins with pixels that are
easy to reconstruct, and gradually proceeds to more complex pixels as fitting
improves.

Hartree-Fock theory gives an excellent ground-state energy and local moment for
intermediate and strong interactions. However, it lacks spin fluctuations and
thus cannot screen the impurity spin. The Gutzwiller variational energy bound
becomes very poor for large interactions because it does not describe properly
the charge fluctuations. Nevertheless, the Gutzwiller approach provides a
qualitatively correct description of the zero-field susceptibility and the
Kondo screening cloud. The DMRG provides excellent data for the ground-state

this using an analytic technique instead of adopting a numerical approach. In
addition, we perform a fixed point analysis of the cosmological dynamical
system, and we examine the behavior of the total effective equation of state
parameter, at the fixed points, as a function of the free parameters of the
system. Finally, we investigate the phenomenological implications of the dark
energy equation of state which we assumed that it governs the dark energy

for resource sharing under real-time constraints. Its importance in modern

for a variety of reasons, determining a job's maximum blocking time could be
difficult, and thus far no exact method has been proposed that does it.
Existing analysis methods are inefficient, inaccurate, and of limited

several models of metal mirrors with a constant outer shape but varying mass
reduction factors. The optimized lightweight mirror exhibits $63.5 \%$ of mass
reduction and a higher stiffness compared to conventional designs, but it is
not manufacturable by cutting techniques. Utilizing Selective Laser Melting
instead, a demonstrator of the mentioned topological non-trivial design is
manufactured out of AlSi12 alloy powder. It is further shown that -- like in
case of a traditional manufactured mirror substrate -- optical quality can be
achieved by diamond turning, electroless nickel plating, and polishing
techniques, which finally results in $< 150$~nm peak-to-valley shape deviation
and a roughness of $< 1$~nm rms in a measurement area of $140 \times 110$

to be negligible. Further it is shown that surface form is maintained over a

different qualities, and thus of varying file sizes, by maximizing the sum of
video quality measures that users can enjoy. There exists an interesting
trade-off between video quality and video diversity, i.e., the ability to
provision diverse video files. By caching high-quality files, the cache-enabled
devices can provide high-quality video, but cannot cache a variety of files.
Conversely, when the device caches various files, it cannot provide a good
quality for file-requesting users. In addition, when multiple devices cache the
same file but their qualities are different, advanced node association is
required for file delivery. This paper proposes a node association algorithm
that maximizes time-averaged video quality for multiple users under a playback
delay constraint. In this algorithm, we also consider request collision, the
situation where several users request files from the same device at the same

from the Vulcano Island (Aeolian archipelago, Italy) at a temperature of 1200
{\deg}C, pressures from 50 to 500 MPa, and water contents ranging from
nominally dry to ca. 2 wt. %. Concentration-distance profiles, measured by
Laser Ablation ICP-MS, highlight different behaviours, and trace elements were
divided into two groups: (1) elements with normal diffusion profiles (13
elements, mainly low field strength and transition elements), and (2) elements
showing uphill diffusion (17 elements including Y, Zr, Nb, Pb and rare earth
elements, except Eu). For the elements showing normal diffusion profiles,
chemical diffusion coefficients were estimated using a concentration-dependent
evaluation method, and values are given at four intermediate compositions (SiO2
equal to 58, 62, 66 and 70 wt. %, respectively). A general coupling of
diffusion coefficients to silica diffusivity is observed, and variations in
systematics are observed between mafic and silicic compositions. Results show
that water plays a decisive role on diffusive rates in the studied conditions,
producing an enhancement between 0.4 and 0.7 log units per 1 wt.% of added H2O.
Particularly notable is the behaviour of the trivalent-only REEs (La to Nd and
Gd to Lu), with strong uphill diffusion minima, diminishing from light to heavy
REEs. Modelling of REE profiles by a modified effective binary diffusion model
indicates that activity gradients induced by the SiO2 concentration contrast
are responsible for their development, inducing a transient partitioning of
REEs towards the shoshonitic melt.

as these early stages often involve critical decisions such as first rounds of
staffing and resource allocation. Traditionally, this estimation has been
performed through coarse-grained measures such as observing numbers in local
venues or venues at similar places (e.g., coffee shops around another station
in the same city). The advent of crowdsourced data from devices and services
carried by individuals on a daily basis has opened up the possibility of
performing better predictions of temporal visitation patterns for locations and
venues. In this paper, using mobility data from Foursquare, a location-centric
platform, we treat venue categories as proxies for urban activities and analyze
how they become popular over time. The main contribution of this work is a
prediction framework able to use characteristic temporal signatures of places
together with k-nearest neighbor metrics capturing similarities among urban
regions, to forecast weekly popularity dynamics of a new venue establishment in
a city neighborhood. We further show how we are able to forecast the popularity
of the new venue after one month following its opening by using locality and
temporal similarity as features. For the evaluation of our approach we focus on
London. We show that temporally similar areas of the city can be successfully
used as inputs of predictions of the visit patterns of new venues, with an
improvement of 41% compared to a random selection of wards as a training set
for the prediction task. We apply these concepts of temporally similar areas
and locality to the real-time predictions related to new venues and show that
these features can effectively be used to predict the future trends of a venue.
Our findings have the potential to impact the design of location-based
technologies and decisions made by new business owners.

vulnerable to hardware impairments due to operating at high frequencies and
employing a large number of radio- frequency (RF) hardware components. In
particular, nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) employed at the transmitter
distort the signal when operated close to saturation due to energy efficiency
considerations. In this paper, we study the performance of a MIMO mmWave hybrid
beamforming scheme in the presence of nonlinear PAs. First, we develop a
statistical model for the transmitted signal in such systems and show that the
spatial direction of the inband distortion is shaped by the beamforming filter.
This suggests that even in the large antenna regime, where narrow beams can be
steered toward the receiver, the impact of nonlinear PAs should not be ignored.
Then, by employing a realistic power consumption model for the PAs, we
investigate the trade-off between spectral and energy efficiency in such
systems. Our results show that increasing the transmit power level when the
number of transmit antennas grows large can be counter-effective in terms of
energy efficiency. Furthermore, using numerical simulation, we show that when
the transmit power is large, analog beamforming leads to higher spectral and
energy efficiency compared to digital and hybrid beamforming schemes.

long-range Coulombic correlations and solvent excluded volume. Correlations
originate from fluctuations of the electrostatic potential beyond the
mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory, evaluated by employing a field-theoretical
loop expansion of the free energy. The solvent excluded-volume, on the other

show that both correlations and excluded volume are required in order to
capture the important features of the dielectric behavior. For highly polar
solvents, such as water, the dielectric constant is given by the product of the
solvent volume fraction and a concentration-dependent susceptibility per volume
fraction. The available solvent volume decreases as function of ionic strength
due the increasing volume fraction of ions. A similar decrease occurs for the
susceptibility due to correlations between the ions and solvent, reducing the
dielectric response even further. Our predictions for the dielectric constant
fit well with experiments for a wide range of concentrations for different
salts in different temperatures, using a single fit parameter related to the

diamond upon ion implantation and subse- quent thermal annealing. Their optical
emission in photoluminescence (PL) regime consists of an articulated spectrum
with intense emission peaks at 552.1 nm and 556.8 nm, accompanied by a set of
additional lines in the 535700 nm range. The attribution of the PL emission to
stable Pb-based defects is corroborated by the correlation of its intensity
with the implantation fluence of Pb ions, while none of the reported features
is observed in reference samples implanted with C ions. Furthermore, PL
measurements performed as a function of sample temperature (143-300 K range)
and un- der different excitation wavelengths (532 nm, 514 nm, 405 nm) suggest
that the complex spectral features observed in Pb-implanted diamond might be
related to a variety of different defects and/or charge states. This work
follows from previous reports on optically active centers in diamond based on
group IV impurities, such as Si, Ge and Pb. In perspective, a comprehensive
study of this set of defect complexes could bring significant insight on the
common features involved in their formation and opto-physical properties, thus
offering a solid basis for the devel- opment of a new generation of
quantum-optical devices.

receive great interest. However, training of autoencoders is typically
complicated by the need to train a separate encoder and decoder model that have
to be enforced to be reciprocal to each other. To overcome this problem,
by-design reversible neural networks (RevNets) had been previously used as
generative models either directly optimizing the likelihood of the data under
the model or using an adversarial approach on the generated data. Here, we
instead investigate their performance using an adversary on the latent space in
the adversarial autoencoder framework. We investigate the generative
performance of RevNets on the CelebA dataset, showing that generative RevNets
can generate coherent faces with similar quality as Variational Autoencoders.
This first attempt to use RevNets inside the adversarial autoencoder framework
slightly underperformed relative to recent advanced generative models using an
autoencoder component on CelebA, but this gap may diminish with further
optimization of the training setup of generative RevNets. In addition to the
experiments on CelebA, we show a proof-of-principle experiment on the MNIST
dataset suggesting that adversary-free trained RevNets can discover meaningful
latent dimensions without pre-specifying the number of dimensions of the latent
sampling distribution. In summary, this study shows that RevNets can be
employed in different generative training settings.

application-level checkpoint and a global rollback to recover. In recent years,
techniques reducing the number of rolling back processes have been implemented
via message logging. However, the log-based approaches have weaknesses, such as
being dependent on complex modifications within an MPI implementation, and the
fact that a full restart may be required in the general case. To address the
limitations of all log-based mechanisms, we return to checkpoint-only
mechanisms, but advocate data-flow-driven recovery (DFR), a fundamentally
different approach relying on analysis of the data flow of iterative codes, and
the well-known concept of data-flow graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
DFR for an MPI stencil code to optimise rollback and reduce the overall energy
consumption by 10-12 % on idling nodes during localised rollback. We also
provide large-scale estimates for the energy savings of DFR compared to global
rollback, which for stencil codes increase as n square for a process count n.

and dynamical properties, typically the product of competing interactions in
ferromagnets, and with great technological potential [1-5]. Researchers have
long wondered whether analogous electric skyrmions might exist in
ferroelectrics, maybe featuring novel behaviors and possibilities for electric
and mechanical control. The results thus far are modest, though: an electric
equivalent of the most typical magnetic skyrmion (which would rely on a
counterpart of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction) seems all but impossible;
further, the exotic ferroelectric orders observed or predicted to date [6-8]
rely on very specific nano-structures (composites, superlattices), which limits
the generality and properties (e.g., mobility) of the possible associated
skyrmions. Here we propose an original approach to write electric skyrmions in
simple ferroelectric lattices in a customary manner. Our second-principles
simulations [9] of columnar ferroelectric nano-domains, in prototype compound
PbTiO3 , show that it is possible to harness the Bloch-type internal structure
of the domain wall [10] and hence create a genuine skyrmion. We check that the
object thus obtained displays the usual skyrmion-defining features; further, it
also presents unusual ones, including a symmetry-breaking skyrmion-skyrmion
transition driven by strain, various types of topological transformations
induced by external fields and temperature, and potentially very small sizes.
Our results suggest countless possibilities for creating and manipulating
electric textures with non-trivial topologies, using standard experimental
tools and materials, effectively inaugurating the field of electric skyrmions.

by inter- action events. However, it remains an open question as to what extent
both merging and non-merging interactions have in triggering starbursts? In
this study, we make use of the Illustris simulation to test how different
triggering mechanisms can effect starburst events. We examine star formation
rate, colour and environment of starburst galaxies to determine if this could
be why we witness a bimodality in post-starburst populations within
observational studies. Further, we briefly test the extent of quenching due to
AGN feedback. From Illustris, we select 196 starburst galaxies at z = 0.15 and
split them into post-merger and pre-merger/harassment driven starburst samples.
We find that 55% of this sample not undergone a merger in the past 2 Gyr. Both
of our samples are located in low-density environments within the filament
regions of the cosmic web, however we find that pre-merger/harassment driven
starburst are in higher density environments than post-merger driven
starbursts. We also find that pre-merger/harassment starbursts are redder than
post-merger starbursts, this could be driven by environmental effects. Both
however, produce nuclear starbursts of comparable strengths.

from positive examples has been recently addressed. In this paper, we address
the problem of identifying a set of DFAs from labeled strings and come up with
two methods. The first is based on state merging and a heuristic related to the
size of each state merging iteration. State merging operations involving a
large number of states are extracted, to provide sub-DFAs. The second method is
based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm whose fitness function takes
into account the accuracy of the DFA w.r.t. the learning sample, as well as the
desired number of DFAs. We evaluate our methods on a dataset originated from
industry.

to the expanse of the IPv6 address space, exhaustive scans as in IPv4 are not
possible for IPv6. In recent years, several studies have proposed the use of
target lists of IPv6 addresses, called IPv6 hitlists.
  In this paper, we show that addresses in IPv6 hitlists are heavily clustered.
We present novel techniques that allow IPv6 hitlists to be pushed from quantity
to quality. We perform a longitudinal active measurement study over 6 months,
targeting more than 50 M addresses. We develop a rigorous method to detect
aliased prefixes, which identifies 1.5 % of our prefixes as aliased, pertaining
to about half of our target addresses. Using entropy clustering, we group the
entire hitlist into just 6 distinct addressing schemes. Furthermore, we perform
client measurements by leveraging crowdsourcing.
  To encourage reproducibility in network measurement research and to serve as
a starting point for future IPv6 studies, we publish source code, analysis
tools, and data.

to standard parametric deep learning models. A DGP is formed by stacking
multiple GPs resulting in a well-regularized composition of functions. The
Bayesian framework that equips the model with attractive properties, such as
implicit capacity control and predictive uncertainty, makes it at the same time
challenging to combine with a convolutional structure. This has hindered the
application of DGPs in computer vision tasks, an area where deep parametric
models (i.e. CNNs) have made breakthroughs. Standard kernels used in DGPs such
as radial basis functions (RBFs) are insufficient for handling pixel
variability in raw images. In this paper, we build on the recent convolutional
GP to develop Convolutional DGP (CDGP) models which effectively capture image
level features through the use of convolution kernels, therefore opening up the
way for applying DGPs to computer vision tasks. Our model learns local spatial
influence and outperforms strong GP based baselines on multi-class image
classification. We also consider various constructions of convolution kernel
over the image patches, analyze the computational trade-offs and provide an
efficient framework for convolutional DGP models. The experimental results on

However, the nested form in the SQL query can cause performance issues on the

have to reduce the momentum (compared with Sync-MSGD). To the best of our

both streaming PCA and training deep neural networks are provided to support

This results in a model that leverages large image context to resolve matching
ambiguities. Second, a novel sub-pixel cross- entropy loss combined with a MAP
estimator make this network less sensitive to ambiguous matches, and applicable
to any disparity range without re-training. We compare PDS to state-of-the-art

some aspects of MBL from this perspective, via local propagators for the FS

key features of the problem, including recovery of an MBL transition, and
predictions for the forms of the SE distributions. The problem is then studied
numerically in $1d$ by exact diagonalization, free from MFT assumptions. The
geometric mean indeed appears to act as a suitable order parameter for the
transition. Throughout the MBL phase the appropriate SE distribution is
confirmed to have a universal form, with long-tailed L\'evy behavior as
predicted by MFT. In the delocalized phase for weak disorder, SE distributions
are clearly log-normal; while on approaching the transition they acquire an
intermediate L\'evy-tail regime, indicative of the incipient MBL phase.

cooling and following accretion of disc gas. We compare isothermal and
non-isothermal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet to
investigate the influence on the feasibility of the recycling mechanism.
Radiative cooling is implemented by using the beta cooling model. We find that,
in either case, gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves
through the midplane regions, or vice versa when disc gas rotates
sub-Keplerian. However, in contrast to the isothermal case where the recycling
flow reaches the deeper part of the envelope, the inflow is inhibited from
reaching the deep envelope in the non-isothermal case. Once the atmosphere
starts cooling, buoyant force prevents the high-entropy disc gas from intruding
the low-entropy atmosphere. We suggest that the buoyancy barrier isolates the
lower envelope from the recycling and allows further cooling, which may lead
runaway gas accretion onto the core.

effects of a faster increase in technological performance in maritime shipping
achieved by leveraging fast-improving technological domains such as computer
processors, and advanced energy storage. Based on historical improvement rates
of several modes of transport (Cargo Ships, Air, Rail, Trucking) a simplified
Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulation of an intermodal transport model
(IMTM) is used to explore the effects of differing technological improvement
rates for AS. The results show that the annual improvement rates of traditional
shipping (Ocean Cargo Ships = 2.6%, Air Cargo = 5.5%, Trucking = 0.6%, Rail =
1.9%, Inland Water Transport = 0.4%) improve at lower rates than technologies
associated with automation such as Computer Processors (35.6%), Fuel Cells
(14.7%) and Automotive Autonomous Hardware (27.9%). The IMTM simulations up to
the year 2050 show that the introduction of any mode of autonomous transport
will increase competition in lower cost shipping options, but is unlikely to
significantly alter the overall distribution of transport mode costs. Secondly,
if all forms of transport end up converting to autonomous systems, then the
uncertainty surrounding the improvement rates yields a complex intermodal
transport solution involving several options, all at a much lower cost over
time. Ultimately, the research shows a need for more accurate measurement of
current autonomous transport costs and how they are changing over time.

by the collapse model adopted, but also by the large number of unknown physical
and chemical parameters. Models which are initially gravitationally unstable
predict similar abundances despite differing densities and collapse timescales,
while ambipolar diffusion produces more extended inner depleted regions which
are not seen in observations of prestellar cores. Molecular observations are
capable of discriminating between modes of collapse despite the unknown values
of various input parameters. We also investigate the evolution of the ambipolar
diffusion timescale for a range of collapse modes, metallicities and cosmic ray
ionization rates, finding that it remains comparable to or larger than the
collapse timescale during the initial stages for all models we consider, but
becomes smaller at later evolutionary stages. This confirms that ambipolar
diffusion is an important process for diffuse gas, but becomes less significant
as cores collapse to higher densities.

The
fundamental step in these representations is the association of a graph

a block sparse representation of the graph signal leading to a modular graph
whose Laplacian matrix admits the found dictionary as its eigenvectors. The
role of sparsity here is to induce a band-limited representation or,
equivalently, a modular structure of the graph. The proposed strategy is
composed of two optimization steps: i) learning an orthonormal sparsifying
transform from the data; ii) recovering the Laplacian, and then topology, from
the transform. The first step is achieved through an iterative algorithm whose
alternating intermediate solutions are expressed in closed form. The second
step recovers the Laplacian matrix from the sparsifying transform through a
convex optimization method. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods over both synthetic data and real brain data, used for
inferring the brain functionality network through experiments conducted over

approximate and even surpass human performance, but machine systems reliably
struggle to generalize information to untrained situations. We describe a
neural network model that is trained to play one video game (Breakout) and
demonstrates one-shot generalization to a new game (Pong). The model
generalizes by learning representations that are functionally and formally
symbolic from training data, without feedback, and without requiring that
structured representations be specified a priori. The model uses unsupervised
comparison to discover which characteristics of the input are invariant, and to
learn relational predicates; it then applies these predicates to arguments in a
symbolic fashion, using oscillatory regularities in network firing to
dynamically bind predicates to arguments. We argue that models of human
cognition must account for far-reaching and flexible generalization, and that
in order to do so, models must be able to discover symbolic representations
from unstructured data, a process we call predicate learning. Only then can
models begin to adequately explain where human-like representations come from,
why human cognition is the way it is, and why it continues to differ from
machine intelligence in crucial ways.

rather than tagging in the sense that grooming always returns a groomed jet,
while tagging dose not return a jet when a single particle remains after
tagging. We find that the grooming procedure makes the jet mass distribution
infrared safe and only ultraviolet divergences appear in each factorized part.
The groomed jet mass distributions are investigated in a wide range of the jet
mass considering various limits on the jet mass variable $\rho =
M_J^2/(p_T^JR)^2$ and the grooming cut $y_c$. Appropriate effective theories in
different kinematic regions are employed to resum large logarithms, in which
the analysis in the region $\rho \sim y_c \ll 1$ is included due to the
different type of factorization. The analytic computation of the factorized
groomed jet mass distribution is presented by resumming the large logarithms in
the jet mass, and $y_c$. Numerically, the effect of the resummation is notably
enhanced, compared with the calculation at next-to-leading order, and nonglobal

studied first using a diblock foam model with unconstrained particle volumes

advantage from its increase by investing on the banks in the core. Investments

between individual elements represented as nodes in a graph. In medical
applications, specifically, nodes can represent individuals within a

set of features, while the graph edges incorporate associations between
subjects in an intuitive manner. This representation allows to incorporate the
wealth of imaging and non-imaging information as well as individual subject
features simultaneously in disease classification tasks. Previous graph-based
approaches for supervised or unsupervised learning in the context of disease
prediction solely focus on pairwise similarities between subjects, disregarding

imaging feature vectors and fail to model interactions between them. In this
paper, we present a thorough evaluation of a generic framework that leverages
both imaging and non-imaging information and can be used for brain analysis in
large populations. This framework exploits Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
and involves representing populations as a sparse graph, where its nodes are
associated with imaging-based feature vectors, while phenotypic information is
integrated as edge weights. The extensive evaluation explores the effect of
each individual component of this framework on disease prediction performance
and further compares it to different baselines. The framework performance is
tested on two large datasets with diverse underlying data, ABIDE and ADNI, for

Space Telescope (HST) program designed to characterize the ionizing radiation
emerging from a sample of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift $z\simeq
3.1$. As many show intense [O III] emission characteristic of $z>6.5$
star-forming galaxies, they may represent valuable low redshift analogs of
galaxies in the reionization era. Using HST Wide Field Camera 3 / UVIS $F336W$
to image Lyman continuum emission, we investigate the escape fraction of
ionizing photons in this sample. For 61 sources, of which 77% are
spectroscopically confirmed and 53 have measures of [O III] emission, we detect
Lyman continuum leakage in 20%, a rate significantly higher than is seen in
individual continuum-selected Lyman break galaxies. We estimate there is a 98%
probability that $\leq 2$ of our detections could be affected by foreground
contamination. Fitting multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to take
account of the varying stellar populations, dust extinctions and metallicities,
we derive individual Lyman continuum escape fractions corrected for foreground
intergalactic absorption. We find escape fractions of 15 to 60% for individual
objects, and infer an average 20% escape fraction by fitting composite SEDs for
our detected samples. Surprisingly however, even a deep stack of those sources
with no individual $F336W$ detections provides a stringent upper limit on the
average escape fraction of less than 0.5%. We examine various correlations with
source properties and discuss the implications in the context of the popular
picture that cosmic reionization is driven by such compact, low metallicity
star-forming galaxies.

detectors have shown a good operation stability with the current gas mixture
during the entire Run 1 (2010$-$2013) and the ongoing Run 2 (2015$-$2018) at
the LHC. The gas mixture is made up of $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$, $SF_{6}$ and
$iC_{4}H_{10}$. Since the first two gases have high Global Warming Potentials
(GWPs), there is the risk that they will be phased out of production in the
next years, due to the recent restrictions and regulations of the European
Union. Therefore, finding a new eco-friendly gas mixture has become extremely
important in order to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition,
the present $iC_{4}H_{10}$ contribution makes the current gas mixture
flammable. Non-flammable components, or at least in non-flammable
concentrations, would be advisable to make the operation of detectors simpler
and safer. In order to identify a gas mixture suited to cope with the
requirements of the ALICE Muon Identifier in the forthcoming High-Luminosity
runs, a dedicated experimental set-up has been used to carry out R&D studies on
promising gas mixtures with small-size RPCs. Hydrofluoroolefins ($HFOs$) are
appropriate candidates to replace the $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ thanks to their very
low GWPs, especially $HFO1234ze$ which is not flammable at room temperature.
Several tests on $HFO$-based mixtures with addition of various gases are
ongoing and encouraging results have already been obtained. Furthermore, the
use of $CO_{2}$ as a quencher has been studied as it might represent a valid
solution to avoid flammability of the mixture. Finally, medium-term stability
of detectors exposed to the cosmic-ray flux will be shown in this paper.

for a diffuse gas component producing absorption features at more extreme

distribution. Its motion requires a bundle of non-uniformly rotating streams of
slightly different inclinations. The inferred gas density peaks are lower than
the local Roche limit. This supports that CND molecular cores are transient. We
apply the two standard orbit models, spirals vs. ellipses, invoked to explain
the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around SgrA*. The location and
velocities of the CO cloudlets are inconsistent with the spiral model, and only
two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets,
however, show similar velocities that are incompatible with the motions of the
ionized streamers or with gas bounded to the central gravity. We speculate that
they are leftovers of more massive, tidally disrupted, clouds that fall into
the cavity, or that they originate from instabilities in the inner rim of the
CND and infall from there. Molecular cloudlets, all together with a mass of

couplings are now severely constrained, entailing a substantially limited

dark energy models that get around this obstacle while still providing
interesting phenomenologies able to distinguish them from the standard

discussion is extensible to a broader class of models. In particular, we show
the possibility of having a non-minimal derivative coupling giving a
non-trivial effect on scalar modes without affecting gravitational waves and
the possibility of having a second tensor mode that can oscillate into
gravitational waves. We also present a novel class of configurations breaking
rotational invariance but with an energy-momentum tensor that is isotropic
on-shell. This peculiar feature makes the scalar and vector sectors of the
perturbations mix so that, even in a perfectly isotropic background cosmology,
preferred direction effects can appear in the perturbations. We also comment on
models that give rise to isotropic solutions when averaging over rapid
oscillations of the vector fields. The explored models are classified according

problems in machine learning. Among existing methods, non-parametric and/or
kernel-based methods are often difficult to use on large datasets, while
methods based on neural networks usually make restrictive parametric
assumptions on the probability densities. Here, we propose a novel method for
estimating the conditional density based on score matching. In contrast to
existing methods, we employ scalable neural networks, but do not make explicit
parametric assumptions on densities. The key challenge in applying score
matching to neural networks is computation of the first- and second-order
derivatives of a model for the log-density. We tackle this challenge by
developing a new neural-kernelized approach, which can be applied on large
datasets with stochastic gradient descent, while the reproducing kernels allow
for easy computation of the derivatives needed in score matching. We show that
the neural-kernelized function approximator has universal approximation
capability and that our method is consistent in conditional density estimation.
We numerically demonstrate that our method is useful in high-dimensional
conditional density estimation, and compares favourably with existing methods.
Finally, we prove that the proposed method has interesting connections to two
probabilistically principled frameworks of representation learning: Nonlinear

they allow the fastest and strongest interaction between nodes. However
measuring the shortest paths between all nodes in a large network is
computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the
shortest path length (SPL) distribution of a network by random walk sampling.
To deal with the unequal inclusion probabilities of dyads (pairs of nodes) in
the sample, we generalize the usage of Hansen-Hurwitz estimator and
Horvitz-Thompson estimator (and their ratio forms) and apply them to the
sampled dyads. Based on theory of Markov chains we prove that the selection
probability of a dyad is proportional to the product of the degrees of the two
nodes. To approximate the actual SPL for a dyad, we use the observed SPL in the
induced subgraph for networks with large degree variability, i.e., the standard
deviation is at least two times of the mean, and for networks with small degree
variability, estimate the SPL using landmarks for networks with small degree
variability. By simulation studies and applications to real networks, we find
that 1) for large networks, high estimation accuracy can be achieved by using a
single random or multiple random walks with total number of steps equal to at
least 20% of the nodes in the network; 2) the estimation performance increases
as the network size increases but tends to stabilize when the network is large

integration problem, third, using this notion to combine information from
multiple samplings at different levels; and fourth using Poisson disk sampling
as a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning. The key idea across
all these contributions is to guarantee adequate consideration of the
underlying non-uniform sample distribution function from a Monte Carlo
perspective. To make the proposed concepts applicable to real-world tasks, we
furthermore propose an efficient implementation which significantly reduces the
GPU memory required during the training process. By employing our method in
hierarchical network architectures we can outperform most of the
state-of-the-art networks on established point cloud segmentation,
classification and normal estimation benchmarks. Furthermore, in contrast to
most existing approaches, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method with
respect to sampling variations, even when training with uniformly sampled data
only. To support the direct application of these concepts, we provide a
ready-to-use TensorFlow implementation of these layers at

onset of each flare, there is a reverse S-shaped filament above the polarity
inversion line. Then the filaments become unstable and begin to rise. The
rising filaments gain the upper hand over the tension force of the dome-like
overlying loops and thus successfully erupt outward. The footpoints of the
reconnecting overlying loops successively brighten and are observed as two
flare ribbons, while the newly formed low-lying loops appear as the post-flare

filament eruptions associated with coronal mass ejections. However, the
erupting filaments in this study move along large-scale lines and eventually
reach the remote solar surface, i.e., no filament material is ejected into the
interplanetary space. Thus both the flares are confined ones. These results
reveal that some successful filament eruptions can trigger confined flares. Our

models -- Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) and Tucker -- in muscle synergy
analysis of the wrist's three main Degree of Freedoms (DoFs) using the public
first Ninapro database. Furthermore, we proposed a constrained Tucker
decomposition (consTD) method for efficient synergy extraction building on the
power of tensor decompositions. This method is proposed as a direct novel
approach for shared and task-specific synergy estimation from two
biomechanically related tasks. Our approach is compared with the current
standard approach of repetitively applying non-negative matrix factorisation
(NMF) to a series of movements. The results show that the consTD method is
suitable for synergy extraction compared to PARAFAC and Tucker. Moreover,
exploiting the multi-way structure of muscle activity, the proposed methods
successfully identified shared and task-specific synergies for all three DoFs
tensors. These were found to be robust to disarrangement with regard to
task-repetition information, unlike the commonly used NMF. In summary, we
demonstrate how to use tensors to characterise muscle activity and develop a
new consTD method for muscle synergy extraction that could be used for shared

the way for the development of novel muscle activity analysis methods based on

Principal component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA),
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and second-order blind identification

synergy sparsity, level of noise and number of channels on the extracted
synergies. Results suggest that the sparse synergy model and a higher number of
channels would result in better-estimated synergies. Without dimensionality
reduction, SOBI showed better results than other factorisation methods. This
suggests that SOBI would be an alternative when a limited number of electrodes
is available but its performance was still poor in that case. Otherwise, NMF
had the best performance when the number of channels was higher than the number
of synergies. Therefore, NMF would be the best method for muscle synergy
extraction.

computational efficiency effectively and provide satisfactory accuracy. This
advantage was especially highlighted in complex models, where the new approach
achieved the same accuracy with only a half number of points. The

exclusively a quantum feature. Here we demonstrate it could be explained
classically only in relativistic terms. The electron is treated as an extended,
continuous, but rigid Gaussian body (RGB) spinning at finite angular frequency.
In contrast to expectations, the mechanical energy and spin angular momentum of
the particle are not diverging but standard values are reproduced. The g-factor
value ge = 2 immediately follows from the ratio of non-relativistic and
relativistic angular momenta which can be both attributed to a spinning
electron of known rest mass. A detailed analysis of the inertia tensor and
limit, torque-free precession reveals a multiplication factor of -2 between the
external and internal precession angular frequency which might resemble the
spin-1/2 appearance of the particle. Furthermore, the theory of Li\'enard and
Wiechert is used to derive a static electromagnetic field. A continuous form of
Gaussian charge density ensures an absence of infinities in electromagnetic
energy and angular momentum. Introducing the associated electromagnetic angular
momentum as a small correction to the mechanical spin angular momentum, we
obtain a modified g-factor ge* = 2.0021 which is close to the measured value ge

associated with the topics above-mentioned, and several contributions have been
proposed: One of the pillars of this work is focused on the estimation of the
most important parameters in the exploitation of renewable resources. The
second contribution of this thesis is related to feature selection problems.
The proposed methodologies are applied to multiple problems: the prediction of
$H_s$, relevant for marine energy applications and marine activities, the
estimation of WPREs, undesirable variations in the electric power produced by a
wind farm, the prediction of global solar radiation in areas from Spain and
Australia, really important in terms of solar energy, and the prediction of
low-visibility events at airports. All of these practical issues are developed
with the consequent previous data analysis, normally, in terms of

reasons. one is the higher proportion of elderly in the population, and the
other is the rise in the share of the elderly who drive. This paper examines
the features of their driving and the level of their awareness of problems
relating to it, by analysis preference survey that included interviews with 205
drivers aged between 70 and 80. The interviewees exhibited a level of optimism
and self confidence in their driving that is out of line with the real
situation. There is also a discrepancy between how their driving is viewed by
others and their own assessment, and between their self assessment and their
assessment of the driving of other elderly drivers, which they rate lower than
their own. they attributed great importance to safety feature in cars, although
they did not think that they themselves needed them, and most elderly drivers
did not think there was any reason that they should stop driving, despite
suggestions from family members and others that they should do so. A declared
preference survey was undertaken to assess the degree of difficulty elderly
drivers attribute to driving conditions. It was found that they are concerned
mainly about weather condition, driving at night, and long journeys. Worry
about night driving was most marked among women, the oldest drivers, and those
who drove less frequently. In light of the findings, imposing greater
responsibility on the health system should be considered. Consideration should
also be given to issuing partial licenses to the elderly for daytime driving
only, or restricted to certain weather conditions, dependent on their medical
condition. Such flexibility will enable the elderly to maintain their life
style and independence for a longer period on the one hand, and on the other,
will minimize the risks to themselves and other.

variable sized input DWI signals eliminating the need to worry about memory
issues as seen with the traditional techniques. The advantage of this

topologies rely on an accurate time information available at the frontend,
where raw data are acquired and tagged with a precise timestamp prior to data

  Guarantee",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Code offloading is promising to accelerate mobile applications and save
energy of mobile devices by shifting some computation to cloud. However,
existing code offloading systems suffer from a long communication delay between
mobile devices and cloud. To address this challenge, in this paper, we consider
to deploy edge nodes in the proximity of mobile devices, and study how they
benefit code offloading. We design an edge-centric code offloading system,
called Echo, over a three-layer computing hierarchy consisting of mobile
devices, edge and cloud. A critical problem needs to be addressed by Echo is to
decide which method should be offloaded to which computing platform (edge or
cloud). Different from existing offloading systems that let mobile devices
individually make offloading decisions, Echo implements a centralized decision
engine at the edge node. This edge-centric design can fully exploit the limited
hardware resources at the edge to provide an offloading service with Quality of
Service guarantee. Furthermore, we propose some novel mechanisms, e.g., lazy
object transmission and differential object update, to further improve system
performance. The results of a small-scale real deployment and trace-driven
simulations show that Echo significantly outperforms existing
