networks. The system includes clients that store and retrieve replicated
information on N servers, out of which e are malicious. When a client access a
malicious server, the data field of that server response might be different
than the value it originally stored. However, all other control variables in
the server reply and protocol actions are according to the server algorithm.
For the coded atomic storage (CAS) algorithms by Cadambe et al., we present an
enhancement that ensures no information leakage and malicious fault-tolerance.
  We also consider recovery after the occurrence of transient faults that
violate the assumptions according to which the system is to behave. After their
last occurrence, transient faults leave the system in an arbitrary state (while
the program code stays intact). We present a self-stabilizing algorithm, which
recovers after the occurrence of transient faults. This addition to Cadambe et
al. considers asynchronous settings as long as no transient faults occur. The
recovery from transient faults that bring the system counters (close) to their
maximal values may include the use of a global reset procedure, which requires
the system run to be controlled by a fair scheduler. After the recovery period,
the safety properties are provided for asynchronous system runs that are not
necessarily controlled by fair schedulers.
  Since the recovery period is bounded and the occurrence of transient faults
is extremely rare, we call this design criteria self-stabilization in the
presence of seldom fairness. Our self-stabilizing algorithm uses a bounded
storage during asynchronous executions (that are not necessarily fair). To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to address privacy and
self-stabilization in the context of emulating atomic shared memory in
networked systems.

mammalian species follows a universal scaling law that can be derived from a
simple theoretical model. The same scaling law has also been shown to hold
across brains of our own species, irrespective of age or sex. These results,
however, only relate measures of complete cortical hemispheres. There are known
systematic variations in morphology between different brain regions, and
region-specific changes with age. It is therefore of interest to extend our
analyses to different cortical regions, and analyze the scaling law within an
individual brain.
  Methods: To directly compare the morphology of sub-divisions of the cortical
surface in a size-independent manner, we base our method on a topological
invariant of closed surfaces. We reconstruct variables of a complete hemisphere
from each lobe of the brain so that it has the same gyrification index, average
thickness and average Gaussian curvature.
  Results: We show that different lobes are morphologically diverse but obey
the same scaling law that was observed across human subjects and across
mammalian species. This is also the case for subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
The age-dependent offset changes at similar rates for all lobes in healthy
subjects, but differs most dramatically in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's
disease.
  Significance: Our results further support the idea that while morphological
parameters can vary locally across the cortical surface/across subjects of the
same species/across species, the processes that drive cortical gyrification are
universal.

molecules, start small, from a few individuals, and grow large into a
noticeable fraction of the environmental carrying capacity $K$. Typically, the
elements of the initiating, sparse set will not be hampering each other and
their number will grow from $Z_0=z_0$ in a branching process or Malthusian
like, roughly exponential fashion, $Z_t \sim a^tW$, where $Z_t$ is the size at
discrete time $t\to\infty$, $a>1$ is the offspring mean per individual (at the
low starting density of elements, and large $K$), and $W$ a sum of $z_0$ i.i.d.
random variables. It will, thus, become detectable (i.e. of the same order as
$K$) only after around $\log K$ generations, when its density $X_t:=Z_t/K$ will
tend to be strictly positive. Typically, this entity will be random, even if
the very beginning was not at all stochastic, as indicated by lower case $z_0$,
due to variations during the early development. However, from that time
onwards, law of large numbers effects will render the process deterministic,
though initiated by the random density at time log $K$, expressed through the
variable $W$. Thus, $W$ acts both as a random veil concealing the start and a
stochastic initial value for later, deterministic population density
development. We make such arguments precise, studying general density and also
system-size dependent, processes, as $K\to\infty$. As an intrinsic size
parameter, $K$ may also be chosen to be the time unit. The fundamental ideas
are to couple the initial system to a branching process and to show that late
densities develop very much like iterates of a conditional expectation
operator.

  to MUSIC",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the classical approaches for estimating the frequencies and damping
factors in a spectrally sparse signal is the MUSIC algorithm, which exploits
the low-rank structure of an autocorrelation matrix. Low-rank matrices have
also received considerable attention recently in the context of optimization
algorithms with partial observations, and nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has
been widely used as a popular heuristic of rank minimization for low-rank
matrix recovery problems. On the other hand, it has been shown that NNM can be
viewed as a special case of atomic norm minimization (ANM), which has achieved
great success in solving line spectrum estimation problems. However, as far as
we know, the general ANM (not NNM) considered in many existing works can only
handle frequency estimation in undamped sinusoids. In this work, we aim to fill
this gap and deal with damped spectrally sparse signal recovery problems. In
particular, inspired by the dual analysis used in ANM, we offer a novel
optimization-based perspective on the classical MUSIC algorithm and propose an
algorithm for spectral estimation that involves searching for the peaks of the
dual polynomial corresponding to a certain NNM problem, and we show that this
algorithm is in fact equivalent to MUSIC itself. Building on this connection,
we also extend the classical MUSIC algorithm to the missing data case. We
provide exact recovery guarantees for our proposed algorithms and quantify how
the sample complexity depends on the true spectral parameters. In particular,
we provide a parameter-specific recovery bound for low-rank matrix recovery of
jointly sparse signals rather than use certain incoherence properties as in
existing literature. Simulation results also indicate that the proposed
algorithms significantly outperform some relevant existing methods (e.g., ANM)
in frequency estimation of damped exponentials.

automation, building secure applications, systems and networks are some of the
main challenges faced in the current decade. The number of threats that
individuals and businesses face is rising exponentially due to the increasing
complexity of networks and services of modern networks. To alleviate the impact
of these threats, researchers have proposed numerous solutions for anomaly
detection; however, current tools often fail to adapt to ever-changing
architectures, associated threats and zero-day attacks. This manuscript aims to
pinpoint research gaps and shortcomings of current datasets, their impact on
building Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and the growing number of
sophisticated threats. To this end, this manuscript provides researchers with
two key pieces of information; a survey of prominent datasets, analyzing their
use and impact on the development of the past decade's Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS) and a taxonomy of network threats and associated tools to carry
out these attacks. The manuscript highlights that current IDS research covers
only 33.3% of our threat taxonomy. Current datasets demonstrate a clear lack of
real-network threats, attack representation and include a large number of
deprecated threats, which together limit the detection accuracy of current
machine learning IDS approaches. The unique combination of the taxonomy and the
analysis of the datasets provided in this manuscript aims to improve the
creation of datasets and the collection of real-world data. As a result, this
will improve the efficiency of the next generation IDS and reflect network
threats more accurately within new datasets.

significant improvement of the contrast compared to DAS without severe increase

characteristic. However, in Newtonian physics the microstate of an individual
system (a point in its phase space) evolves incessantly in accord with its
equations of motion. Ensembles were introduced in XIX century to bridge that
chasm between continuous motion of phase space points in Newtonian dynamics and
stasis of thermodynamics: While states of individual classical systems
inevitably evolve, a phase space distribution of such states -- an ensemble --
can be time-independent. I show that entanglement (e.g., with the environment)
can yield a time-independent equilibrium in an individual quantum system. This
allows one to eliminate ensembles -- an awkward stratagem introduced to
reconcile thermodynamics with Newtonian mechanics -- and use an individual
system interacting and therefore entangled with its heat bath to represent
equilibrium and to elucidate the role of information and measurements in
physics. Thus, in our quantum Universe one can practice statistical physics
without ensembles -- hence, in a sense, without statistics. The elimination of
ensembles uses ideas that led to the recent derivation of Born's rule from the
symmetries of entanglement, and I start with a review of that derivation. I
then review and discuss difficulties related to the reliance on ensembles and
illustrate the need for ensembles with the classical Szilard's engine. A
similar quantum engine -- a single system interacting with the thermal heat
bath environment -- is enough to establish thermodynamics. The role of
Maxwell's demon (which in this quantum context resembles Wigner's friend) is

a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of

range of ""neighboring"" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly
depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To
adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture --
jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node,
different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation.
In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore,
combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks,
GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models'
performance.

a transition redshift, $z_t=0.71\substack{+0.12 -0.12}$ (when the Universe

change the state. This type of setup is common to many robot motion planning
hardness proofs. We characterize the complexity for a natural simple case: each
gadget connects up to four locations in a perfect matching (but each direction
can be traversable or not in the current state), has one or two states, every
gadget traversal is immediately undoable, and that gadget locations are
connected by an always-traversable forest, possibly restricted to avoid
crossings in the plane. Specifically, we show that any single nontrivial
four-location two-state gadget type is enough for motion planning to become
PSPACE-complete, while any set of simpler gadgets (effectively two-location or
one-state) has a polynomial-time motion planning algorithm. As a sample
application, our results show that motion planning games with ""spinners"" are
PSPACE-complete, establishing a new hard aspect of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.

of occam's razor and finds the ""simplest"" network that explains the observed

network, including the internal nodes and links of the network that are not
amenable to direct measurement. In addition to network topology, OCCAM infers
the routing paths that packets take between the hosts. OCCAM uses path metrics
measurable from the hosts and expresses the observed measurements as
constraints of a mixed-integer bilinear optimization problem that can then be
feasibly solved to yield the network topology and the routing paths. We
empirically validate OCCAM on a wide variety of real-world ISP networks and
show that its inferences agree closely with the ground truth. Specifically,
OCCAM infers the topology with an average network similarity score of 93% and
infers routing paths with a path edit distance of 0.20. Further, OCCAM is
robust to error in its measured path metric inputs, producing high quality
inferences even when 20-30% of its inputs are erroneous. Our work is a
significant advance in network tomography as it proposes and empirically
evaluates the first method that infers the complete network topology, rather

Monitoring-Control Attacks (MCA) --i.e., attacks in which adversaries
manipulate control decisions by fabricating measurement signals in the feedback
loop-- are highly threatening. This is because, MCAs are (i) more likely to
happen with greater attack surface and lower cost, (ii) difficult to detect by
hiding in measurement signals, and (iii) capable of inflicting severe
consequences by coordinating attack resources. To defend against MCAs, we have
developed a semantic analysis framework for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
in power grids. The framework consists of two parts running in parallel: a
Correlation Index Generator (CIG), which indexes correlated MCAs, and a
Correlation Knowledge-Base~(CKB), which is updated aperiodically with attacks'
Correlation Indices (CI). The framework has the advantage of detecting MCAs and
estimating attack consequences with promising runtime and detection accuracy.
To evaluate the performance of the framework, we computed its false alarm rates

database-driven cognitive radio networks that protect secondary users' (SUs)
location privacy while allowing them to learn spectrum availability in their
vicinity. Our schemes harness probabilistic set membership data structures to
exploit the structured nature of spectrum databases (DBs) and SUs' queries.
This enables us to create a compact representation of DB that could be queried
by SUs without having to share their location with DB, thus guaranteeing their
location privacy. Our proposed schemes offer different cost-performance
characteristics. Our first scheme relies on a simple yet powerful two-party
protocol that achieves unconditional security with a plausible communication
overhead by making DB send a compacted version of its content to SU which needs
only to query this data structure to learn spectrum availability. Our second
scheme achieves significantly lower communication and computation overhead for
SUs, but requires an additional architectural entity which receives the
compacted version of the database and fetches the spectrum availability
information in lieu of SUs to alleviate the overhead on the latter. We show
that our schemes are secure, and also demonstrate that they offer significant
advantages over existing alternatives for various performance and/or security
metrics.

images have undergone complex deformations remains a challenging task in the
field of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical method to
tackle this problem by first semantically targeting the foreground objects to
localize the search space and then looking deeply into multiple levels of the
feature representation to search for point-level correspondence. In contrast to
existing approaches, which typically penalize large discrepancies, our approach
allows for significant displacements, with the aim to accommodate large
deformations of the objects in scene. Localizing the search space by
semantically matching object-level correspondence, our method robustly handles
large deformations of objects. Representing the target region by concatenated
hypercolumn features which take into account the hierarchical levels of the
surrounding context, helps to clear the ambiguity to further improve the
accuracy. By conducting multiple experiments across scenes with non-rigid
objects, we validate the proposed approach, and show that it outperforms the
state of the art methods for semantic correspondence establishment.

infer that T implies H? What world knowledge would be needed for this task?
Although such knowledge-intensive techniques have not had much success in RTE
evaluations, ultimately an intelligent system should be expected to know and
deploy this kind of world knowledge required to perform this kind of reasoning.
  The selected examples are typically ones which our RTE system (called BLUE)
got wrong and ones which require world knowledge to answer. In particular, the
analysis covers cases where there was near-perfect lexical overlap between T

roughly, it is eps-close to the uniform distribution when restricted to any k

distribution can be from any globally k-wise uniform distribution. We show that
every (eps, k)-wise uniform distribution is O(n^(k/2) eps)-close to a k-wise
uniform distribution in total variation distance. In addition, we show that
this bound is optimal for all even k: we find an (eps, k)-wise uniform
distribution that is Omega(n^(k/2) eps)-far from any k-wise uniform
distribution in total variation distance. For k = 1, we get a better upper
bound of O(eps), which is also optimal.
  One application of our closeness result is to the sample complexity of
testing whether a distribution is k-wise uniform or delta-far from k-wise
uniform. We give an upper bound of O(n^k/delta^2) (or O(log n/delta^2) when k =
1) on the required samples. We show an improved upper bound of
O~(n^(k/2)/delta^2) for the special case of testing fully uniform vs. delta-far

Omega(n/delta^2) when k = 2.

spectroscopic measurements of available space missions, and investigate the
properties of non-damping oscillations at flaring loops. Methods. We used the
IRIS to measure the spectrum over a narrow slit. The double-component Gaussian
fitting method was used to extract the line profile of Fe XXI 1354.08 A at ""O
I"" window. The quasi-periodicity of loop oscillations were identified in the
Fourier and wavelet spectra. Results. A periodicity at about 40 s is detected
in the line properties of Fe XXI, HXR emissions in GOES 1-8 A derivative, and
Fermi 26-50 keV. The Doppler velocity and line width oscillate in phase, while
a phase shift of about Pi/2 is detected between the Doppler velocity and peak
intensity. The amplitudes of Doppler velocity and line width oscillation are
about 2.2 km/s and 1.9 km/s, respectively, while peak intensity oscillate with
amplitude at about 3.6% of the background emission. Meanwhile, a quasi-period
of about 155 s is identified in the Doppler velocity and peak intensity of Fe
XXI, and AIA 131 A intensity. Conclusions. The oscillations at about 40 s are
not damped significantly during the observation, it might be linked to the
global kink modes of flaring loops. The periodicity at about 155 s is most
likely a signature of recurring downflows after chromospheric evaporation along
flaring loops. The magnetic field strengths of the flaring loops are estimated
to be about 120-170 G using the MHD seismology diagnostics, which are
consistent with the magnetic field modeling results using the flux rope

from segmentation of arterial wall boundaries from Intravascular Ultrasound

describe the luminal area of human coronary. Each EREL is then fitted by an
ellipse to represent the luminal border. The goal is to assign the most
appropriate EREL as the lumen. In this work, EREL selection carries out in two
rounds. In the first round, the pattern in a set of EREL regions is analyzed
and used to generate an approximate luminal region. Then, the two-dimensional
(2D) correlation coefficients are computed between this approximate region and
each EREL to keep the ones with tightest relevance. In the second round, a
compactness measure is calculated for each EREL and its fitted ellipse to
guarantee that the resulting EREL has not affected by the common artifacts such
as bifurcations, shadows, and side branches. We evaluated the selected ERELs in

location-based applications in intelligent transport systems such as

systems and wireless communication technology enabled vehicles has resulted in
huge volumes of trajectory data. The task of utilizing this data employing
spatio-temporal techniques for trajectory prediction in an efficient and
accurate manner is an ongoing research problem. Existing TP approaches are
limited to short-term predictions. Moreover, they cannot handle a large volume
of trajectory data for long-term prediction. To address these limitations, we
propose a scalable clustering and Markov chain based hybrid framework, called
Traj-clusiVAT-based TP, for both short-term and long-term trajectory
prediction, which can handle a large number of overlapping trajectories in a
dense road network. Traj-clusiVAT can also determine the number of clusters,
which represent different movement behaviours in input trajectory data. In our
experiments, we compare our proposed approach with a mixed Markov model
(MMM)-based scheme, and a trajectory clustering, NETSCAN-based TP method for
both short- and long-term trajectory predictions. We performed our experiments
on two real, vehicle trajectory datasets, including a large-scale trajectory
dataset consisting of 3.28 million trajectories obtained from 15,061 taxis in
Singapore over a period of one month. Experimental results on two real
trajectory datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the existing
approaches in terms of both short- and long-term prediction performances, based
on prediction accuracy and distance error (in km).

evolution, its effects are not well understood. Thanks to high- quality and
long timebase photometric observations obtained with recent space missions, we
are now able to study stellar rotation more precisely. Aims. We aim to
constrain radial differential rotation profiles in gamma Doradus (gamma Dor)
stars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with
rapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods. We derive a new asymptotic
description which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core
rotation on gravity- mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are
illustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with
observations of gamma Dor stars. When possible, we also derive the surface
rotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of
rotational modulation, and compute the core-to-surface rotation ratios.
Results. Stellar rotation has to be strongly differential before its effects on
period spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing
patterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained
period spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai
modes. Finally, we find signatures of rotational spot modulation in the
photometric data of eight targets. Conclusions. If only one period spacing
pattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect
differential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best
solution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple period
spacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface rotation rate
is known as well. This is the case for eight stars in our sample, revealing
surface-to-core rotation ratios between 0.95 and 1.05.

clopens, we obtain several new results on lifting idempotents. The Zariski
clopens of the maximal spectrum are precisely determined, then as an
application, lifting idempotents modulo the Jacobson radical is characterized.
Lifting idempotents modulo an arbitrary ideal is also characterized in terms of
certain connected sets related to that ideal. Then as an application, we obtain
that the sum of a lifting ideal and a regular ideal is a lifting ideal. We
prove that lifting idempotents preserves the orthogonality in countable cases.
The lifting property of an arbitrary morphism of rings is characterized. As
another major result, it is proved that the number of idempotents of a ring $R$
is finite if and only if it is of the form $2^{\kappa}$ where $\kappa$ is the
cardinal of the connected components of Spec$(R)$. Finally, it is proved that
the primitive idempotents of a zero dimensional ring are in 1-1 correspondence
with the isolated points of its prime spectrum. These results either generalize
or improve several important results in the literature.

Later it was found to be an asynchronous polar, now called V1500 Cyg. Our
multisite photometric campaign occurring 40 years post eruption covered
26-nights (2015-2017). The reflection effect from the heated donor has
decreased, but still dominates the op- tical radiation with an amplitude
~1^m.5. The 0^m.3 residual reveals cyclotron emission and ellipsoidal
variations. Mean brightness modulation from night-to-night is used to measure
the 9.6-d spin-orbit beat period that is due to changing accretion geometry
including magnetic pole-switching of the flow. By subtracting the orbital and
beat frequencies, spin-phase dependent light curves are obtained. The amplitude
and profile of the WD spin light curves track the cyclotron emitting accretion
regions on the WD and they vary systematically with beat phase. A weak
intermittent signal at 0.137613-d is likely the spin period, which is 1.73(1)
min shorter than the orbital period. The O-C diagram of light curve maxima
displays phase jumps every one-half beat period, a characteristic of
asynchronous polars. The first jump we interpret as pole switching between
regions separated by 180 deg. Then the spot drifts during ~0.1 beat phase
before undergoing a second phase jump between spots separated by less than 180
deg. We trace the cooling of the still hot WD as revealed by the irradiated
companion. The post nova evolution and spin-orbit asynchronism of V1500 Cyg
continues to be a powerful laboratory for accretion flows onto magnetic white

diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. It is not only because of that
echocardiography is a real-time imaging technology and widespread in clinical
application, but also because of that LV segmentation on 3D echocardiography
can provide more full volume information of heart than LV segmentation on 2D
echocardiography. However, 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography is still an
open and challenging task owing to the lower contrast, higher noise and data
dimensionality, limited annotation of 3D echocardiography. In this paper, we
proposed a novel real-time framework, i.e., VoxelAtlasGAN, for 3D LV
segmentation on 3D echocardiography. This framework has three contributions: 1)
It is based on voxel-to-voxel conditional generative adversarial nets (cGAN).
For the first time, cGAN is used for 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography.
And cGAN advantageously fuses substantial 3D spatial context information from
3D echocardiography by self-learning structured loss; 2) For the first time, it
embeds the atlas into an end-to-end optimization framework, which uses 3D LV
atlas as a powerful prior knowledge to improve the inference speed, address the
lower contrast and the limited annotation problems of 3D echocardiography; 3)
It combines traditional discrimination loss and the new proposed consistent
constraint, which further improves the generalization of the proposed
framework. VoxelAtlasGAN was validated on 60 subjects on 3D echocardiography
and it achieved satisfactory segmentation results and high inference speed. The
mean surface distance is 1.85 mm, the mean hausdorff surface distance is 7.26
mm, mean dice is 0.953, the correlation of EF is 0.918, and the mean inference
speed is 0.1s. These results have demonstrated that our proposed method has
great potential for clinical application

cosmic-ray properties, such as energy and mass. A long standing challenge is to
access this information experimentally with a sparse grid of antennas. We
present a new analytic model of the radio signal distribution that depends only
on the definition of the shower axis and on the parameters energy and distance
to the emission region. The distance to the emission region has a direct
relation to the cosmic ray's mass. This new analytic model describes the
different polarizations of the radiation and therefore allows the use of
independently measured signals in different polarization, thereby doubling the
amount of information that is available in current radio arrays, compared to
what has been used thus far. We show with the use of CoREAS Monte Carlo
simulation that fitting the measurements with our model does not result in
significant contributions in both systematic bias and in resolution for the
extracted parameters energy and distance to emission region, when compared to
the expected experimental measurement uncertainties.

query-by-example (QbE) speech search. The temporal context includes the leading
and trailing word sequences of a word. We assume that there exist spoken word
pairs in the training database. We pad the word pairs with their original
temporal context to form fixed-length speech segment pairs. We obtain the
acoustic word embeddings through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
which is trained on the speech segment pairs with a triplet loss. Shifting a
fixed-length analysis window through the search content, we obtain a running
sequence of embeddings. In this way, searching for the spoken query is
equivalent to the matching of acoustic word embeddings. The experiments show
that our proposed acoustic word embeddings learned with temporal context are
effective in QbE speech search. They outperform the state-of-the-art
frame-level feature representations and reduce run-time computation since no
dynamic time warping is required in QbE speech search. We also find that it is
important to have sufficient speech segment pairs to train the deep CNN for
effective acoustic word embeddings.

application in which representations learned from real intraoperative

hyperrealism is introduced in this field, which we regard as a novel subform of
surgical augmented reality for approaches that involve real-time object
transfigurations. For related tasks in the computer vision community, unpaired
cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown excellent
results on still RGB images. Though, application of this approach to continuous
video frames can result in flickering, which turned out to be especially
prominent for this application. Therefore, we propose an extension of
cycle-consistent GANs, named tempCycleGAN, to improve temporal consistency.The
novel method is evaluated on captures of a silicone phantom for training
endoscopic reconstructive mitral valve procedures. Synthesized videos show
highly realistic results with regard to 1) replacement of the silicone
appearance of the phantom valve by intraoperative tissue texture, while 2)
explicitly keeping crucial features in the scene, such as instruments, sutures
and prostheses. Compared to the original CycleGAN approach, tempCycleGAN
efficiently removes flickering between frames. The overall approach is expected
to change the future design of surgical training simulators since the generated
sequences clearly demonstrate the feasibility to enable a considerably more
realistic training experience for minimally-invasive procedures.

allowed to vary between iterations. Several basic properties of topological
pressure and topological entropy of NAIFSs are provided. Especially, we
generalize the classical Bowen's result to NAIFSs ensures that the topological
entropy is concentrated on the set of nonwandering points. Then, we define the
notion of specification property, under which, the NAIFSs have positive
topological entropy and all points are entropy points. In particular, each
NAIFS with the specification property is topologically chaotic. Additionally,
the $\ast$-expansive property for NAIFSs is introduced. We will prove that the
topological pressure of any continuous potential can be computed as a limit at
a definite size scale whenever the NAIFS satisfies the $\ast$-expansive
property. Finally, we study the NAIFSs induced by expanding maps. We prove that

always been a major limitation of the spectral efficiency of cellular
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) networks. This letter proposes an
FD-directional spatial channel estimation algorithm for frequency division
duplex massive FD-MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm uses the statistical
spatial correlation between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channels of each
user equipment. It spatially decomposes the UL channel into azimuthal and
elevation dimensions to estimate the array principal receive responses. An FD
spatial rotation matrix is constructed to estimate the corresponding transmit
responses of the DL channel, in terms of the frequency band gap between the UL
and DL channels. The proposed algorithm shows significantly promising
performance, approaching the ideal perfect-CSIT case without UL feedback
overhead.

contractivity and dissipativity, of the solutions to several numerical methods
for fractional ordinary differential equations (F-ODEs). The existing algebraic
contractivity and dissipativity rates of the solutions to the scalar F-ODEs are
first improved. In order to study the long time behavior of numerical solutions
to fractional backward differential formulas (F-BDFs), two crucial analytical
techniques are developed, with the first one for the discrete version of the
fractional generalization of the traditional Leibniz rule, and the other for
the algebraic decay rate of the solution to a linear Volterra difference
equation. By mens of these auxiliary tools and some natural conditions, the
solutions to F-BDFs are shown to be contractive and dissipative, and also
preserve the exact contractivity rate of the continuous solutions. Two typical
F-BDFs, based on the Grunwald-Letnikov formula and L1 method respectively, are
studied. For high order F-BDFs, including some second order F-BDFs and
$3-\alpha$ order method, their numerical contractivity and dissipativity are
also developed under some slightly stronger conditions. Numerical experiments
are presented to validate the long time qualitative characteristics of the
solutions to F-BDFs, revealing very different decay rates of the numerical
solutions in terms of the the initial values between F-ODEs and integer ODEs
and demonstrating the superiority of the structure-preserving numerical
methods.

electronic properties of materials, and it has been influential for theory of
high-temperature superconducting cuprates. Importantly, NMR found early that
nuclear relaxation is much faster than what one expects from coupling to
fermionic excitations above the critical temperature for superconductivity
($T_{\rm c}$), i.e. what one estimates from the Knight shift with the Korringa
law. As a consequence, special electronic spin fluctuations have been invoked.
Here, based on literature relaxation data it is shown that the electronic
excitations, to which the nuclei couple with a material and doping dependent
anisotropy, are rather ubiquitous and Fermi liquid-like. A suppressed NMR spin
shift rather than an enhanced relaxation leads to the failure of the Korringa
law for most materials. Shift and relaxation below $T_{\rm c}$ support the view
of suppressed shifts, as well. A simple model of two coupled electronic spin
components, one with $3d(x^2-y^2)$ orbital symmetry and the other with an
isotropic $s$-like interaction can explain the data. The coupling between the
two components is found to be negative, and it must be related to the pseudogap
behavior of the cuprates. We can also explain the negative shift conundrum and
the long-standing orbital shift discrepancy for NMR in the cuprates.

interest in the conjecture it has only been shown to hold for some classes of

  In this work, we prove the conjecture for extremal cases, functions with
small influence and functions with high entropy. Specifically, we show that:
  * FEI holds for the class of functions with ${\bf I}[f] \leq 2^{-cn}$ with
the constant $C = 4 \cdot \frac{c+1}{c}$. Furthermore, proving FEI for a class
of functions with ${\bf I}[f] \leq 2^{-s(n)}$ for some $s(n) = o(n)$ will imply
FEI for the class of all Boolean functions.

read-k decision trees, from ${\bf H}[f] \leq O(k) \cdot {\bf I}[f]$ to ${\bf

finely discrete time. Dimensions are simultaneously related to their observed
(possibly multivariate) markers through nonlinear equations of observation.
Parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood framework enjoying a closed
form for the likelihood. We demonstrate in a simulation study that this dynamic
model in discrete time benefits the same causal interpretation of temporal
relationships as models defined in continuous time as long as the
discretization step remains small. The model is then applied to the data of the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Three longitudinal dimensions
(cerebral anatomy, cognitive ability and functional autonomy) measured by 6
markers are analyzed and their temporal structure is contrasted between
different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Keywords: causality,
difference equations, latent process, longitudinal data, mixed models,
multivariate data.

In previous work, the estimation principle called noise-contrastive estimation

distinguish between data and auxiliary noise. An open question is how to best
choose the auxiliary noise distribution. We here propose a new method that
addresses this issue. The proposed method shares with NCE the idea of
formulating density estimation as a supervised learning problem but in contrast
to NCE, the proposed method leverages the observed data when generating noise
samples. The noise can thus be generated in a semi-automated manner. We first
present the underlying theory of the new method, show that score matching
emerges as a limiting case, validate the method on continuous and discrete
valued synthetic data, and show that we can expect an improved performance
compared to NCE when the data lie in a lower-dimensional manifold. Then we

arguments based entirely on experimental grounds we argue and demonstrate that
the class of HF systems is characterized by universal scaling behavior of their

irrespective of the individual details of their symmetries, interactions, and

of a new state of matter manifest in HF compounds. We propose a simple,
realistic model to study the appearance of flat bands in two-dimensional
ensembles of ultracold fermionic atoms, interacting with coherent resonant
light. It is shown that signatures of these flat bands may be found in

algorithm for reservoir data assimilation through integrating domain
decomposition (DD), radial basis function (RBF) interpolation and the
trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL). It is an efficient approach for
model reduction and linearization of general non-linear time-dependent
dynamical systems without intruding the legacy source code. In the subdomain
POD-TPWL algorithm, firstly, a sequence of snapshots over the entire
computational domain are saved and then partitioned into subdomains. From the
local sequence of snapshots over each subdomain, a number of local basis
vectors is formed using POD, and then the RBF interpolation is used to estimate
the derivative matrices for each subdomain. Finally, those derivative matrices
are substituted into a POD-TPWL algorithm to form a reduced-order linear model
in each subdomain. This reduced-order linear model makes the implementation of
the adjoint easy and resulting in an efficient adjoint-based parameter
estimation procedure. The performance of the new adjoint-based parameter
estimation algorithm has been assessed through several synthetic cases.
Comparisons with the classic finite-difference based history matching show that
our proposed subdomain POD-TPWL approach is obtaining comparable results. The
number of full-order model simulations required is roughly 2-3 times the number
of uncertain parameters. Using different background parameter realizations, our
approach efficiently generates an ensemble of calibrated models without
additional full-order model simulations.

multiplier-less radix 22 DIF (Decimation In Frequency) SDF (single path delay

reduce computation complexity in butterfly multiplier, the digit-slicing
multiplier-less technique was utilized in the critical path of pipeline
Radix-22 DIF SDF FFT structure. The proposed design focused on the trade-off
between the speed and active silicon area for the chip implementation. The
multiplier input data was sliced into four blocks each one with four bits to
process at the same time in parallel. The new architecture was investigated and
simulated with MATLAB software. The Verilog HDL code in Xilinx ISE environment
was derived to describe the FFT Butterfly functionality and was downloaded to
Virtex II FPGA board. Consequently, the Virtex-II FG456 Proto board was used to
implement and test the design on the real hardware. As a result, from the
findings, the synthesis report indicates the maximum clock frequency of 555.75
MHz with the total equivalent gate count of 32,146 is a marked and significant
improvement over Radix 22 DIF SDF FFT butterfly. In comparison with the
conventional butterfly architecture design which can only run at a maximum
clock frequency of 200.102 MHz and the conventional multiplier can only run at
a maximum clock frequency of 221.140 MHz, the proposed system exhibits better
results.

mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and
massive machine type communications. Emerging URLLC services require up to one
millisecond of communication latency with 99.999% success probability. Though,
there is a fundamental trade-off between system spectral efficiency (SE) and
achievable latency. This calls for novel scheduling protocols which
cross-optimize system performance on user-centric; instead of network-centric
basis. In this paper, we develop a joint multi-user preemptive scheduling
strategy to simultaneously cross-optimize system SE and URLLC latency. At each
scheduling opportunity, available URLLC traffic is always given higher
priority. When sporadic URLLC traffic appears during a transmission time
interval (TTI), proposed scheduler seeks for fitting the URLLC-eMBB traffic in
a multi-user transmission. If the available spatial degrees of freedom are
limited within a TTI, the URLLC traffic instantly overwrites part of the
ongoing eMBB transmissions to satisfy the URLLC latency requirements, at the
expense of minimal eMBB throughput loss. Extensive dynamic system level
simulations show that proposed scheduler provides significant performance gain
in terms of eMBB SE and URLLC latency.

perpetually grants incoming URLLC traffic a higher priority for instant
scheduling. In case that radio resources are not immediately schedulable,
proposed scheduler forcibly enforces an artificial spatial user separation, for
the URLLC traffic to get instantly scheduled over shared resources with ongoing
eMBB transmissions. A pre-defined reference spatial subspace is constructed for
which scheduler instantly picks the active eMBB user whose precoder is the
closest possible. Then, it projects the eMBB precoder on-the-go onto the
reference subspace, in order for its paired URLLC user to orient its decoder
matrix into one possible null space of the reference subspace. Hence, a robust
decoding ability is always preserved at the URLLC user, while cross-maximizing
the ergodic capacity. Compared to the state-of-the-art proposals from industry
and academia, proposed scheduler shows extreme URLLC latency robustness with
significantly improved overall spectral efficiency. Analytical analysis and
extensive system level simulations are presented to support paper conclusions.

for the sigma-delta modulators. This paper presents the analysis and design of
low power and high-speed comb filters. The comparison is made between the
recursive and the non-recursive comb filters with the focus on high speed and
saving power consumption. Design procedures and examples are given by using
Matlab and Verilog HDL for both recursive and non-recursive comb filter with
emphasis on frequency response, transfer function and register width. The
implementation results show that non-recursive comb filter has the capability
of speeding up the circuit and reducing power compared to recursive one when
the decimation ratio and filter order are high. Using Modified Carry Look-ahead
Adder for summation and also apply pipelined filter structure makes it more
compatible with DSP application.

high performance. However, the main bottleneck that affects the communication
capability is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is the core of most
modulators. This study presents an on-chip implementation of pipeline
digit-slicing multiplier-less butterfly for FFT structure. The approach is
taken, in order to reduce computation complexity in the butterfly,
digit-slicing multiplier-less single constant technique was utilized in the
critical path of Radix-2 Decimation In Time (DIT) FFT structure. The proposed
design focused on the trade-off between the speed and active silicon area for
the chip implementation. The new architecture was investigated and simulated
with MATLAB software. The Verilog HDL code in Xilinx ISE environment was
derived to describe the FFT Butterfly functionality and was downloaded to
Virtex II FPGA board. Consequently, the Virtex-II FG456 Proto board was used to
implement and test the design on the real hardware. As a result, from the
findings, the synthesis report indicates the maximum clock frequency of 549.75
MHz with the total equivalent gate count of 31,159 is a marked and significant
improvement over Radix 2 FFT butterfly. In comparison with the conventional
butterfly architecture, the design that can only run at a maximum clock
frequency of 198.987 MHz and the conventional multiplier can only run at a
maximum clock frequency of 220.160 MHz, the proposed system exhibits better
results. The resulting maximum clock frequency increases by about 276.28% for
the FFT butterfly and about 277.06% for the multiplier. It can be concluded
that on-chip implementation of pipeline digit-slicing multiplier-less butterfly
for FFT structure is an enabler in solving problems that affect communications
capability in FFT and possesses huge potentials for future related works and
research areas.
