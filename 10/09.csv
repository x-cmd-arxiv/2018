perturbed Kerr black holes. Here, we present new phenomenological methods to
model the analytically understood gravitational wave spectra (quasi-normal mode
frequencies), and harmonic structure of Kerr black holes (mixing coefficients
between spherical and spheroidal harmonics). In particular, we present a
greedy-multivariate-polynomial (GMVP) regression method and
greedy-multivariate-rational (GMVR) regression method for the automated
modeling of polynomial and rational functions respectively. GMVR is a
quasi-linear numerical method for interpolating rational functions. It
therefore represents a solution to Runge's phenomenon. GMVP is used to develop
a model for QNM frequencies that explicitly enforces consistency with the
extremal Kerr limit. GMVR is used to develop a model for harmonic mixing
coefficients that extends previous results to dominant multipoles with $\ell
\le 5$. Both models are the first of their kind to consider black hole spin to
vary between -1 and 1, thus naturally connecting the pro and retrograde modes.
We discuss the potential use of these models in current and future

this problem we are given a pattern $P$ of length $w$ and a text $T$ of length

find all the positions $j$ in $T$ such that there is a substring of $T$ ending
at $j$ which has edit distance at most $k$ from the pattern $P$. Recall, the
edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of character
insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into
the other. For a position $t$ in $\{1,...,n\}$, let $k_t$ be the smallest edit
distance between $P$ and any substring of $T$ ending at $t$. In this paper we
give a constant factor approximation to the sequence $k_1,k_2,...,k_{n}$. We
consider both offline and online settings.
  In the offline setting, where both $P$ and $T$ are available, we present an
algorithm that for all $t$ in $\{1,...,n\}$, computes the value of $k_t$
approximately within a constant factor. The worst case running time of our
algorithm is $O(n w^{3/4})$. As a consequence we break the $O(nw)$-time barrier

computes $k_t$ approximately within $O(1)$-multiplicative factor and
$w^{8/9}$-additive error. Our algorithm takes $O(w^{1-(7/54)})$ amortized time
per symbol arrival and takes $O(w^{1-(1/54)})$ additional space apart from
storing the pattern $P$.
  Both of our algorithms are randomized and produce correct answer with high

sub-linear (in the length of the pattern) time and sub-linear succinct space
algorithm for online approximate pattern matching problem.

models. Such deep neural models, however, are not applicable to most human
languages due to the lack of annotated training data for various NLP tasks.
Cross-lingual transfer learning (CLTL) is a viable method for building NLP
models for a low-resource target language by leveraging labeled data from other
(source) languages. In this work, we focus on the multilingual transfer setting
where training data in multiple source languages is leveraged to further boost
target language performance.
  Unlike most existing methods that rely only on language-invariant features
for CLTL, our approach coherently utilizes both language-invariant and
language-specific features at instance level. Our model leverages adversarial
networks to learn language-invariant features, and mixture-of-experts models to
dynamically exploit the similarity between the target language and each
individual source language. This enables our model to learn effectively what to
share between various languages in the multilingual setup. Moreover, when
coupled with unsupervised multilingual embeddings, our model can operate in a
zero-resource setting where neither target language training data nor
cross-lingual resources are available. Our model achieves significant
performance gains over prior art, as shown in an extensive set of experiments
over multiple text classification and sequence tagging tasks including a
large-scale industry dataset.

facilitate the understanding of the Denef-Loeser motivic Milnor fiber and
closely related objects. Our study focuses on the so-called ""nonarchimedean
Milnor fiber"" that was introduced by Hrushovski and Loeser, and our thesis is
that it is a richer embodiment of the underlying philosophy of the Milnor
construction. The said narrative is first developed in the more natural complex
environment, and is then extended to the real one via descent. In the process
of doing so, we are able to provide more illuminating new proofs, free of
resolution of singularities, of a few pivotal results in the literature, both
complex and real. To begin with, the real motivic zeta function is shown to be
rational, which yields the real motivic Milnor fiber; this is an analogue of
the Hrushovski-Loeser construction. We also establish, in a much more intuitive
manner, a new Thom-Sebastiani formula, which can be specialized to the one
given by Guibert, Loeser, and Merle. Finally, applying $T$-convex integration
after descent, matching the Euler Characteristics of the topological Milnor
fiber and the motivic Milnor fiber becomes a matter of simple computation,
which is not only free of resolution of singularities as in the

can occur in the dynamical system variables. As we demonstrate, the solutions
of the dynamical system are non-singular for all cosmic times and this result
is general, meaning that the initial conditions corresponding to the regular
solutions, belong to a general set of initial conditions and not to a limited
set of initial conditions. As we explain, a dynamical system singularity is not
directly related to a physical finite-time singularity. Then, by assuming that
the Hubble rate with functional form $H(t)=f_1(t)+f_2(t)(t-t_s)^{\alpha}$, is a
solution of the dynamical system, we investigate the implications of the
absence of finite-time singularities in the dynamical system variables. As we
demonstrate, Big Rip and a Type IV singularities can always occur if

behaviors are adopted. In widely-used models of biological contagion,
interventions that randomly rewire edges (generally making them ""longer"")
accelerate spread. However, there are other models relevant to social
contagion, such as those motivated by myopic best-response in games with
strategic complements, in which an individual's behavior is described by a
threshold number of adopting neighbors above which adoption occurs (i.e.,
complex contagions). Recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather than
random, networks facilitate spread of these complex contagions. Here we show
that minor modifications to this model, which make it more realistic, reverse
this result, thereby harmonizing qualitative facts about how network structure
affects contagion. To model the trade-off between long and short edges we
analyze the rate of spread over networks that are the union of circular
lattices and random graphs on $n$ nodes. Allowing for noise in adoption
decisions (i.e., adoptions below threshold) to occur with order $1/\sqrt{n}$
probability along some ""short"" cycle edges) is enough to ensure that random
rewiring accelerates spread. This conclusion continues to hold true under
partial but frequent enough rewiring and when adoption decisions are reversible
but infrequently so. Simulations illustrate the robustness of these results to
several variations on this noisy best-response behavior. Hypothetical
interventions that randomly rewire existing edges or add random edges (versus
adding ""short"", triad-closing edges) in hundreds of empirical social networks
reduce time to spread. This revised conclusion suggests that those wanting to
increase spread should induce formation of long ties, rather than triad-closing
ties. More generally, this highlights the importance of noise in game-theoretic
analyses of behavior.

an increase in speckle size leads to smoothening of the self-consistent
background potential, increase in the critical disorder needed for a
superfluid-insulator transition, and an increase in superfluid $T_c$ . Along
with these hints at decrease in effective disorder, speckle correlations also
suppress the superfluid gap and the gap formation temperature - effects
normally associated with increasing disorder. We correlate these effects with
the effective potential and the single particle localisation effects in the
ground state

tissue micro-vascularization. It appears as a promising tool to build imaging
biomark-ers for diagnostic, prognosis or anti-angiogenesis treatment monitoring
of cancer. However, quantitative analysis of DCE image sequences suffers from
low signal to noise ratio (SNR). SNR may be improved by averaging functional
information in a large region of interest when it is functionally homogeneous.
  We propose a novel method for automatic segmentation of DCE image sequences
into functionally homogeneous regions, called DCE-HiSET. Using an observation
model which depends on one parameter a and is justified a posteri-ori,
DCE-HiSET is a hierarchical clustering algorithm. It uses the p-value of a
multiple equivalence test as dissimilarity measure and consists of two steps.
The first exploits the spatial neighborhood structure to reduce complexity and
takes advantage of the regularity of anatomical features, while the second
recovers (spatially) disconnected homogeneous structures at a larger (global)
scale. Given a minimal expected homogeneity discrepancy for the multiple
equivalence test, both steps stop automatically by controlling the Type I
error. This provides an adaptive choice for the number of clusters. Assuming
that the DCE image sequence is functionally piecewise constant with signals on
each piece sufficiently separated, we prove that DCE-HiSET will retrieve the
exact partition with high probability as soon as the number of images in the
sequence is large enough. The minimal expected homogeneity discrepancy appears
as the tuning parameter controlling the size of the segmentation.
  DCE-HiSET has been implemented in C++ for 2D and 3D image sequences with
competitive speed.

show that the algorithm guarantees a $\frac{n}{k}$-approximation for training

et al. To exploit the remarkable efficiency of SMT solving, a natural approach
to solve systems of higher-order Horn constraints is to reduce them to systems
of first-order Horn constraints. This paper presents a defunctionalization
algorithm to achieve the reduction.
  Given a well-sorted higher-order constrained Horn clause (HoCHC) problem
instance, the defunctionalization algorithm constructs a first-order
well-sorted constrained Horn clause problem. In addition to well-sortedness of
the algorithm's output, we prove that if an input HoCHC is solvable, then the

already be made about these systems, simply based on their symmetries and
electron fillings. The insulator in the Moire superlattice is described by an
effective spin-orbital model with approximate higher symmetries than ordinary
spin systems. We demonstrate that both the insulators observed at the 1/2 and
1/4 fillings away from the charge neutrality can be viewed as the boundary of a
three-dimensional bosonic symmetry protected topological phase, and hence have
the 't Hooft anomaly once the spatial symmetries are viewed as internal
symmetries.

progress, but risks societal harm. As a recent example, researchers have shown
that popular word embedding algorithms exhibit stereotypical biases, such as
gender bias. The widespread use of these algorithms in machine learning
systems, from automated translation services to curriculum vitae scanners, can
amplify stereotypes in important contexts. Although methods have been developed
to measure these biases and alter word embeddings to mitigate their biased
representations, there is a lack of understanding in how word embedding bias
depends on the training data. In this work, we develop a technique for
understanding the origins of bias in word embeddings. Given a word embedding
trained on a corpus, our method identifies how perturbing the corpus will
affect the bias of the resulting embedding. This can be used to trace the
origins of word embedding bias back to the original training documents. Using
our method, one can investigate trends in the bias of the underlying corpus and
identify subsets of documents whose removal would most reduce bias. We
demonstrate our techniques on both a New York Times and Wikipedia corpus and
find that our influence function-based approximations are very accurate.

Compared with Spitzer measurements 10 years earlier, the 31.5 micron flux has

Herschel 70 micron excess, which was detected 5 years earlier. The dust mass
needed to account for the the 31.5--70 micron excess is 3--7x10^-4 Msun, more
than ten times larger than the ring dust mass (1x10^-5 Msun) estimate from the
data 10-years earlier. We argue that dust grains are re-formed or grown in the
post-shock regions in the ring after forward shocks have destroyed pre-existing
dust grains in the ring and released refractory elements into gas. In the
post-shock region, atoms can stick to surviving dust grains, and the dust mass
may have increased (grain growth), or dust grains might have condensed directly
from the gas. An alternative possibility is that the outer part of the
expanding ejecta dust might have been heated by X-ray emission from the
circumstellar ring. The future development of this excess could reveal whether
grains are reformed in the post-shocked region of the ring or eject dust is
heated by X-ray.

a galaxy and its star formation rate (SFR) and play key roles in galaxy
evolution models. In this paper, we present new empirical SF laws of disc
galaxies based on volume densities. Following the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium, we calculated the radial growth of the thickness of the gaseous
discs in the combined gravitational potential of dark matter, stars, and gas
for 12 nearby star-forming galaxies. This allowed us to convert the observed
surface densities of gas and SFR into the deprojected volume densities. We
found a tight correlation with slope in the range 1.3-1.9 between the volume
densities of gas (HI+H$_2$) and the SFR with a significantly smaller scatter
than the surface-based (Kennicutt) law and no change in the slope over five
orders of magnitude. This indicates that taking into account the radial
increase of the thickness of galaxy discs is crucial to reconstruct their
three-dimensional density profiles, in particular in their outskirts. Moreover,
our result suggests that the break in the slope seen in the Kennicutt law is
due to disc flaring rather than to a drop of the SF efficiency at low surface
densities. Surprisingly, we discovered an unexpected correlation between the
volume densities of HI and SFR, indicating that the atomic gas is a good tracer
of the cold star-forming gas, especially in low density HI-dominated
environments.

two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the moving-mesh code DISCO of a
BH inspiraling at the GW rate in a binary system with a mass ratio
$q\!=\!M_2/M_1\!=\!10^{-3}$, embedded in an accretion disc. We assume a locally

and implement a standard $\alpha$-prescription for its viscosity (with $\alpha
= 0.03$). We find disc torques on the binary that are weaker than in previous
semi-analytic toy models, and are in the opposite direction: the gas disc slows
down, rather than speeds up the inspiral. We compute the resulting deviations
in the GW waveform, which scale linearly with the mass of the disc. The SNR of
these deviations accumulates mostly at high frequencies, and becomes detectable
in a 5-year LISA observation if the total phase shift exceeds a few radians. We
find that this occurs if the disc surface density exceeds $\Sigma_0 \gtrsim

probability of measurement sequences, and generalize the ""sum over position
histories "" of the Feynman path-integral. As we argue in the present note, this
description has some computational advantages over the usual state vector
description, and may help to clarify some issues regarding nonlocality of
quantum correlations and collapse. A measurement on a system described by $C$
modifies the history operator, $C \rightarrow PC$, where $P$ is the projector
corresponding to the measurement. We refer to this modification as ""history
operator collapse"". Thus $C$ keeps track of the succession of measurements on a
system, and contains all histories compatible with the results of these
measurements. The collapse modifies the history content of $C$, and therefore
modifies also the past (relative to the measurement), but never in a way to
violate causality. Probabilities of outcomes are obtained as $Tr(C^\dagger P
C)/Tr(C^\dagger C)$. A similar formula yields probabilities for intermediate
measurements, and reproduces the result of the two-vector formalism in the case
of given initial and final states. We apply the history operator formalism to a
few examples: entangler circuit, Mach-Zehnder interferometer, teleportation
circuit, three-box experiment. Not surprisingly, the propagation of coordinate
eigenstates $|q\rangle$ is described by a history operator $C$ containing the
Feynman path-integral.

diagnostics for integrated measurements introduce bias in the results. We
modeled the ionised gas combining the mid- and far-infrared fine-structure
cooling lines observed with Spitzer/IRS and Herschel/PACS, with the
photoionisation code Cloudy. The free parameters of the models are the age of
the stellar cluster, the density and the ionisation parameter of the ionised
gas as well as the depth of the cloud. The latter is used to investigate the
leakage of the ionising photons from the analysed regions of IC 10. We
investigate HII regions in the main star-forming body, on scales of ~25 pc,
three in the main star-forming region in the center of the galaxy and two on
the first arc. We then consider larger sizes on the scale of ~200 pc. We find
that most clumps have nearly identical properties, density ~10$^{2.} $ -
10$^{2.6}$ cm$^{-3}$, ionisation parameter between 10$^{-2.2}$ and 10$^{-1.6}$
and age of the stellar cluster ~5.5 Myr. All of them are matter-bounded
regions, allowing ionising photons to leak. The relatively uniform physical
properties of the clumps suggest a common origin for their star formation
activity, which could be related to the feedback from stellar winds or
supernovae of a previous generation of stars. The properties derived for ~200
pc size ""zones"" have similar properties as the HII regions they encompass, but
with the larger regions tending to be more radiation-bounded. Finally, we
investigate the fraction of [CII] 157.7 {\mu}m, [SiII] 34.8 {\mu}m, and [FeII]
25.9 {\mu}m, emission arising from the ionised gas phase and we find that most

as requiring a constant density core at the centre, at odds with the ""cuspy""
inner profiles predicted by $N$-body simulations of cold dark matter (CDM)
haloes. It has been suggested that this conflict could be resolved by
fluctuations in the inner gravitational potential caused by the periodic
removal of gas following bursts of star formation. Earlier work has suggested
that core formation requires a bursty and extended star formation history
(SFH). Here we investigate the structure of CDM haloes of dwarf galaxies
($M_{{\rm DM}} \sim 10^9-5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) formed in the APOSTLE
('A Project of Simulating the Local Environment') and AURIGA cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations have comparable or better resolution
than others that make cores ($M_{{\rm gas}} \sim 10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$,
gravitational softening $\sim 150$ pc). Yet, we do not find evidence of core
formation at {\it any} mass or any correlation between the inner slope of the
DM density profile and temporal variations in the SFH. APOSTLE and AURIGA
dwarfs display a similar diversity in their cumulative SFHs to available data
for Local Group dwarfs. Dwarfs in both simulations are DM-dominated on all
resolved scales at all times, likely limiting the ability of gas outflows to
alter significantly the central density profiles of their haloes. We conclude
that recurrent bursts of star formation are not sufficient to cause the
formation of cores, and that other conditions must also be met for baryons to
be able to modify the central DM cusp.

The huge statistics of the HL-LHC, delivering $\mathcal{L}=3$ ab$^{-1}$ to

an improvement in their statistical and systematic uncertainties. Here we

statistics of this model is known to be Wigner-Dyson. Our aim is to understand
if this integrability breaking is manifested in the high-temperature spin
transport. We focus first on the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), where the
chain is connected to spin baths that act as sources and sinks for spin
excitations at the boundaries. Using a combination of open quantum system
theory and matrix product operators techniques, we extract the transport
properties by means of a finite-size scaling of the spin current in the NESS.
Our results indicate that, despite the formation of a partial domain wall in
the steady state magnetization (and despite the Wigner-Dyson level spacing
distribution of the model), transport remains ballistic. We contrast this
behavior with the one produced by a staggered magnetic field in the XXZ chain,
for which it is known that transport is diffusive. By performing a numerical
computation of the real part of the spin conductivity, we show that our
findings are consistent with linear response theory. We discuss subtleties

attention, primarily for its applications in machine learning and neural
networks. A quantum analogue of the IBM has recently been defined, and an
attempt at providing an operational interpretation of the so-called quantum IB
function as an optimal rate of an information-theoretic task, has recently been
made by Salek et al. However, the interpretation given in that paper has a
couple of drawbacks; firstly its proof is based on a conjecture that the
quantum IB function is convex, and secondly, the expression for the rate
function involves certain entropic quantities which occur explicitly in the
very definition of the underlying information-theoretic task, thus making the
latter somewhat contrived. We overcome both of these drawbacks by first proving
the convexity of the quantum IB function, and then giving an alternative
operational interpretation of it as the optimal rate of a bona fide
information-theoretic task, namely that of quantum source coding with quantum
side information at the decoder, and relate the quantum IB function to the rate
region of this task. We similarly show that the related privacy funnel function
is convex (both in the classical and quantum case). However, we comment that it
is unlikely that the quantum privacy funnel function can characterize the
optimal asymptotic rate of an information theoretic task, since even its
classical version lacks a certain additivity property which turns out to be
essential.

all odd under an additional $Z_2$ symmetry, as a unifying framework for
simultaneous explanation of inflation, dark matter, baryogenesis and neutrino
mass. The inert doublet is coupled nonminimally to gravity and forms the
inflaton. The lightest neutral particle of this doublet later becomes the dark
matter candidate. Baryogenesis is achieved via leptogenesis by the decay of
$N_1$ to SM leptons and the inert doublet particles. Neutrino masses are
generated at the one-loop level. Explaining all these phenomena together in one
model is very economic and gives us a new set of constraints on the model
parameters. We calculate the inflationary parameters like spectral index,
tensor-to-scalar ratio and scalar power spectrum, and find them to be
consistent with the Planck 2018 constraints. We also do the reheating analysis

find that the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be obtained and the

region and the inner solar system, orbiting the Sun in the giant planet region.
Some Centaurs display cometary activity, which cannot be sustained by the
sublimation of water ice in this part of the solar system, and has been
hypothesized to be due to the crystallization of amorphous water ice.
  Aims. In this work, we look at Centaurs discovered by the Outer Solar System
Origins Survey (OSSOS) and search for cometary activity. Tentative detections
would improve understanding of the origins of activity among these objects.
  Methods. We search for comae and structures by fitting and subtracting both
Point Spread Functions (PSF) and Trailed point-Spread Functions (TSF) from the
OSSOS images of each Centaur. When available, Col-OSSOS images were used to
search for comae too.
  Results. No cometary activity is detected in the OSSOS sample. We track the
recent orbital evolution of each new Centaur to confirm that none would
actually be predicted to be active, and we provide size estimates for the
objects.
  Conclusions. The addition of 20 OSSOS objects to the population of 250 known
Centaurs is consistent with the currently understood scenario, in which drastic
drops in perihelion distance induce changes in the thermal balance prone to
trigger cometary activity in the giant planet region.

shortcoming is often not well reflected during evaluation because the same
strong priors exist in test distributions; however, a VQA system that fails to
ground questions in image content would likely perform poorly in real-world
settings. In this work, we present a novel regularization scheme for VQA that
reduces this effect. We introduce a question-only model that takes as input the
question encoding from the VQA model and must leverage language biases in order
to succeed. We then pose training as an adversarial game between the VQA model
and this question-only adversary -- discouraging the VQA model from capturing
language biases in its question encoding. Further,we leverage this
question-only model to estimate the increase in model confidence after
considering the image, which we maximize explicitly to encourage visual
grounding. Our approach is a model agnostic training procedure and simple to
implement. We show empirically that it can improve performance significantly on
a bias-sensitive split of the VQA dataset for multiple base models -- achieving
state-of-the-art on this task. Further, on standard VQA tasks, our approach
shows significantly less drop in accuracy compared to existing bias-reducing
VQA models.

exclusively used because previously proposed speech separation techniques have
critical constraints for application to real meetings. This paper proposes a
new signal processing module, called an unmixing transducer, and describes its
implementation using a windowed BLSTM. The unmixing transducer has a fixed
number, say J, of output channels, where J may be different from the number of
meeting attendees, and transforms an input multi-channel acoustic signal into J
time-synchronous audio streams. Each utterance in the meeting is separated and
emitted from one of the output channels. Then, each output signal can be simply
fed to a speech recognition back-end for segmentation and transcription. Our
meeting transcription system using the unmixing transducer outperforms a system
based on a state-of-the-art neural mask-based beamformer by 10.8%. Significant
improvements are observed in overlapped segments. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report that applies overlapped speech recognition to

theory (or equivalently the Abelian Higgs model) and $\chi$PT arises due to the
presence of additional momentum-dependent (derivative) interactions in $\chi$PT
and the presence of electromagnetically neutral pions that interact with the
charged pions via strong interactions but do not couple directly to the
external magnetic field. We find that while the vortex lattice structure is
hexagonal similar to vortices in GL theory, the condensation energy (relative
to the normal vacuum state in a uniform, external magnetic field) is smaller
(larger in magnitude) due to the presence of derivative interactions.
Furthermore, we establish that neutral pions do not condense in the vortex
lattice near the upper critical field.

proposed a sufficient condition detecting the genuinely entangled pure states.
In this paper, we indicate that generally, the coefficient vector of a pure

vectors, and show that a pure state of $n$ qubits is a product state if and
only if there exists a permutation of qubits such that under the permutation,
its coefficient vector arranged in ascending lexicographical order can be
decomposed into a tensor product of two vectors. The contrapositive of this
result reads that a pure state of $n$ qubits is genuinely entangled if and only
if its coefficient vector cannot be decomposed into a tensor product of two
vectors under any permutation of qubits. Further, by dividing a coefficient
vector into $2^{i}$ equal-size block vectors, we show that the coefficient
vector can be decomposed into a tensor product of two vectors if and only if
any two non-zero block vectors of the coefficient vector are proportional. In
terms of \textquotedblleft proportionality\textquotedblright , we can rephrase
that a pure state of $n$ qubits is genuinely entangled if and only if there are
two non-zero block vectors of the coefficient vector which are not proportional
under any permutation of qubits. Thus, we avoid decomposing a coefficient
vector into a tensor product of two vectors to detect the genuine entanglement.
We also present the full decomposition theorem for product states of n qubits.

the problem of energy sharing in such a community. This is different from
previously addressed energy sharing between buildings as our focus is on the
improvement of community energy status, while traditionally research focused on
reducing losses due to transmission and storage, or achieving economic gains.
We model this problem in a multi-agent environment and propose a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution. Each building is represented by an
intelligent agent that learns over time the appropriate behaviour to share
energy. We have evaluated the proposed solution in a multi-agent simulation
built using osBrain. Results indicate that with time agents learn to
collaborate and learn a policy comparable to the optimal policy, which in turn
improves the ZEC's energy status. Buildings with no renewables preferred to
request energy from their neighbours rather than from the supply grid.

isothermal simulations which created large numbers of sinks over a large range

\propto M^{\Gamma}$, asymptotically and accurately approaches $\Gamma = -1.$
Simple analytic models show that such a power law can develop if the mass
accretion rate $\dot{M} \propto M^2$, as in Bondi-Hoyle accretion; however, the
sink mass accretion rates in the simulations show significant departures from
this relation. In this paper we show that the expected accretion rate
dependence is more closely realized provided the gravitating mass is taken to
be the sum of the sink mass and the mass in the near environment. This
reconciles the observed mass functions with the accretion rate dependencies,

of gravitational focusing, a mechanism present in, for example, the competitive

constructing median composite spectra of diverse broad absorption lines (BALs)
and `mini-BALs' in SDSS-III BOSS quasars at redshifts 2.3 < z < 3.5. Sorting by
CIV 1549,1551 absorption-line strength with AlIII 1855,1863 as an additional
indicator of low ionisations (LoBALs) we find the following: (1) Deeper and
broader BALs are accompanied by weaker HeII 1640 emission lines, consistent
with softer ionising spectra producing more effective radiative acceleration.
(2) PV 1118,1128 absorption is present with resolved ~1:1 depth ratios in all
composites from mini-BALs to strong BALs indicating that line saturation, large
total column densities log N_H(cm^-2) > 22.7, and large ionisation parameters
log U > -0.5 are common. (3) Different observed depths in saturated lines
identify inhomogeneous partial covering on spatial scales <0.006 pc, where
weak/low-abundance transitions like PV form in small high-column density clumps
while stronger/broader lines like CIV form in larger volumes. (4) Excited-state
SiIV* 1073 and CIII* 1176 lines in BAL outflows indicate typical densities n_e
> 3 x 10^5 cm^-3 and maximum radial distances R < 23pc from the quasars. (5)
For reasonable actual distances, the median BAL outflow has minimum kinetic
energy L_K/L > 0.005(R/1.2pc) sufficient (by some estimates) for feedback to
galaxy evolution. (6) LoBAL quasars have the largest median outflow column
densities, highest velocities, and weakest HeII 1640 emission in our study;
they appear to be at one extreme in a distribution of quasar properties where
softer ionising spectra drive more powerful outflows.

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations detected a strong potassium feature

Here, we present high-resolution observations (R>80,000) of WASP-31b with the

comprehensive search for potassium using differential transit light curves, and
integration over the planet's radial velocity. Our observations do not detect K
absorption at the level previously reported with HST, consistent with the VLT
observations. We measure a differential light curve depth $\Delta F = 0.00031

upper limit on the core line depth of $\Delta F \leq 0.007$ (3\sigma) at a few

there are still significant limitations to our understanding of instrumental
systematics even with our most stable space-based instrumentation, and that
care must be taken when extracting narrow band signatures from low-resolution

methodologies should be a priority, and confronting the limitations of

conducted as part of the Hayabusa mission, with a large number of scientific
findings being derived from the returned samples. Following the Hayabusa
mission, Hayabusa2 was planned, targeting sample return from a primitive
asteroid. The primary target body of Hayabusa2 was asteroid 162173 Ryugu;
however, it was also necessary to gather physical information for backup target
selection. Therefore, we examined five asteroids spectroscopically, 43
asteroids spectrophotometrically, and 41 asteroids through periodic analysis.
Hence, the physical properties of 74 near-Earth asteroids were obtained, which
helped the Hayabusa2 backup target search and, also, furthered understanding of
the physical properties of individual asteroids and their origins.

proof is to consider certain varieties $B^r_n$ that are universal varieties for
degree-$n$ Azumaya algebras equipped with a set of $r$ generators, and
specifically we show that a natural map on Chow group $CH^{(r-1)(n-1)}_{PGL_n}

also has rich associational structures that can serve as a further resource for
achieving successful reference. Here we investigate this use of associational
information in a setting where only associational information is available: a
simplified version of the popular game Codenames. Using optimal experiment
design techniques, we compare a range of models varying in the type of
associative information deployed and in level of pragmatic sophistication
against human behavior. In this setting, we find that listeners' behavior
reflects direct bigram collocational associations more strongly than
word-embedding or semantic knowledge graph-based associations and that there is
little evidence for pragmatically sophisticated behavior by either speakers or
listeners of the type that might be predicted by recursive-reasoning models
such as the Rational Speech Acts theory. These results shed light on the nature
of the lexical resources that speakers and listeners can bring to bear in
achieving reference through associative meaning alone.

considers that processes use different names for the same memory location.
Hence, there is permanent disagreement on the location names among processes.
In this context, the PODC paper presented -among other results- a symmetric
deadlock-free mutual exclusion (mutex) algorithm for two processes and a
necessary condition on the size $m$ of the anonymous memory for the existence
of a symmetric deadlock-free mutex algorithm in an $n$-process system. This
condition states that $m$ must be greater than $1$ and belong to the set
$M(n)=\{m:\forall~\ell:1<\ell\leq n:~\gcd(\ell,m)=1\}$ (symmetric means that,
while each process has its own identity, process identities can only be
compared with equality).
  The present paper answers several open problems related to symmetric
deadlock-free mutual exclusion in an $n$-process system ($n\geq 2$) where the
processes communicate through $m$ registers. It first presents two algorithms.
The first considers that the registers are anonymous read/write atomic
registers and works for any $m$ greater than $1$ and belonging to the set
$M(n)$. It thus shows that this condition on $m$ is both necessary and
sufficient. The second algorithm considers anonymous read/modify/write atomic
registers. It assumes that $m\in M(n)$. These algorithms differ in their design
principles and their costs (measured as the number of registers which must
contain the identity of a process to allow it to enter the critical section).
The paper also shows that the condition $m\in M(n)$ is necessary for
deadlock-free mutex on top of anonymous read/modify/write atomic registers. It
follows that, when $m>1$, $m\in M(n)$ is a tight characterization of the size
of the anonymous shared memory needed to solve deadlock-free mutex, be the
anonymous registers read/write or read/modify/write.

imprinting a spin texture with a nonlinear magnetic field generated by a pair
of coils in a modified Helmholtz configuration. We also investigate the case

the monopole and antimonopole are connected by a vortex line segment carrying

characterized by covariance matrices. In this paper, we consider the problem of
simultaneously estimating the dimension of the principal (dominant) subspace of
these covariance matrices and obtaining an approximation to the subspace. This
problem arises in the popular principal component analysis (PCA), and in many
applications of machine learning, data analysis, signal and image processing,
and others. We first present a novel method for estimating the dimension of the
principal subspace. We then show how this method can be coupled with a Krylov
subspace method to simultaneously estimate the dimension and obtain an
approximation to the subspace. The dimension estimation is achieved at no
additional cost. The proposed method operates on a model selection framework,
where the novel selection criterion is derived based on random matrix
perturbation theory ideas. We present theoretical analyses which (a) show that
the proposed method achieves strong consistency (i.e., yields optimal solution
as the number of data-points $n\rightarrow \infty$), and (b) analyze conditions
for exact dimension estimation in the finite $n$ case. Using recent results, we
show that our algorithm also yields near optimal PCA. The proposed method
avoids forming the sample covariance matrix (associated with the data)
explicitly and computing the complete eigen-decomposition. Therefore, the
method is inexpensive, which is particularly advantageous in modern data
applications where the covariance matrices can be very large. Numerical
experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed method in various

consider three path geometries: point-to-line, point-to-half-line, and
point-to-line with paths restricted to stay in a half-plane. Through exact
formulas, we establish new connections between integrable probabilistic models

compute the Laplace transform of the polymer partition functions in the above

two geometries we also provide multiple contour integral formulas. For the

structure from a single image using Manhattan world assumption. This problem is
a distinctly unsolved problem because there can be multiple 3D reconstructions
from a single image. Thus, we are often forced to look for priors like
Manhattan world assumption and common scene structures. In addition to the
standard orthogonality, perspective projection, and parallelism constraints, we
investigate a few novel constraints based on the physical realizability of the
3D scene structure. We treat the line segments in the image to be part of a
graph similar to straws and connectors game, where the goal is to back-project
the line segments in 3D space and while ensuring that some of these 3D line
segments connect with each other (i.e., truly intersect in 3D space) to form
the 3D structure. We consider three sets of novel constraints while solving the
reconstruction: (1) constraints on a series of Manhattan line intersections
that form cycles, but are not all physically realizable, (2) constraints on
true and false intersections in the case of nearby lines lying on the same
Manhattan plane, and (3) constraints from the intersections on boundary and
non-boundary line segments. The reconstruction is achieved using mixed integer
linear programming (MILP), and we show compelling results on real images. Along
with this paper, we will release a challenging Single View Line Reconstruction
dataset with ground truth 3D line models for research purposes.

performance in many machine learning tasks. However, researchers have
discovered that these state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to adversarial
examples: legitimate examples added by small perturbations which are
unnoticeable to human eyes. Adversarial training, which augments the training
data with adversarial examples during the training process, is a well known
defense to improve the robustness of the model against adversarial attacks.
However, this robustness is only effective to the same attack method used for
adversarial training. Madry et al.(2017) suggest that effectiveness of
iterative multi-step adversarial attacks and particularly that projected
gradient descent (PGD) may be considered the universal first order adversary
and applying the adversarial training with PGD implies resistance against many
other first order attacks. However, the computational cost of the adversarial
training with PGD and other multi-step adversarial examples is much higher than
that of the adversarial training with other simpler attack techniques. In this
paper, we show how strong adversarial examples can be generated only at a cost
similar to that of two runs of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), allowing
defense against adversarial attacks with a robustness level comparable to that
of the adversarial training with multi-step adversarial examples. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-step defense
approach against different attack methods and its improvements over existing
defense strategies.

high Reynolds number. Classical related issues are addressed and discussed in
light of the DNS data, including validity of compressibility transformations,
velocity/temperature relations, passive scalar statistics, and size of
turbulent eddies.Regarding velocity statistics, we find that Huang's
transformation yields excellent universality of the scaled Reynolds stresses
distributions, whereas the transformation proposed by Trettel and Larsson
(2016) yields better representation of the effects of strong variation of
density and viscosity occurring in the buffer layer on the mean velocity
distribution. A clear logarithmic layer is recovered in terms of transformed
velocity and wall distance coordinates at the higher Reynolds number under
scrutiny ($\Rey_{\tau} \approx 1000$), whereas the core part of the flow is
found to be characterized by a universal parabolic velocity profile. Based on
formal similarity between the streamwise velocity and the passive scalar
transport equations, we further propose an extension of the above
compressibility transformations to also achieve universality of passive scalar
statistics. Analysis of the velocity/temperature relationship provides evidence
for quadratic dependence which is very well approximated by the thermal analogy
proposed by Zhang et Al.(2014). The azimuthal velocity and scalar spectra show
an organization very similar to canonical incompressible flow, with a
bump-shaped distribution across the flow scales, whose peak increases with the
wall distance. We find that the size growth effect is well accounted for
through an effective length scale accounting for the local friction velocity
and for the local mean shear.

Rapidly-exploring Random disjointed-Trees* (RRdT*), an incremental optimal
multi-query planner. RRdT* uses multiple disjointed-trees to exploit
local-connectivity of spaces via Markov Chain random sampling, which utilises
neighbourhood information derived from previous successful and failed samples.
To balance local exploitation, RRdT* actively explore unseen global spaces when
local-connectivity exploitation is unsuccessful. The active trade-off between
local exploitation and global exploration is formulated as a multi-armed bandit
problem. We argue that the active balancing of global exploration and local
exploitation is the key to improving sample efficient in sampling-based motion
planners. We provide rigorous proofs of completeness and optimal convergence

scores on these dimensions are directly involved in the intervention process

small scale vortexes, we further generalize our unified first-order hyperbolic
formulation of continuum fluid and solid mechanics which treats the flowing
medium as a Riemann-Cartan manifold with zero curvature but non-vanishing
torsion. We associate the rotational degrees of freedom of the main field of
our theory, the distortion field, to the dynamics of microscopic (unresolved)
vortexes. The distortion field characterizes the deformation and rotation of
the material elements and can be viewed as anholonomic basis triad with
non-vanishing torsion. The torsion tensor is then used to characterize
distortion's spin and is treated as an independent field with its own time
evolution equation. This new governing equation has essentially the structure
of the non-linear electrodynamics in a moving medium and can be viewed as a
Yang-Mills-type gauge theory. The system is closed by providing an example of
the total energy potential. The extended system describes not only irreversible
dynamics (which raises the entropy) due to the viscosity or plasticity effect
but it also has dispersive features which are due to the reversible energy
exchange (which conserves the entropy) between micro and macro scales. Both the
irreversible and dispersive processes are represented by relaxation-type
algebraic source terms so that the overall system remains first-order
hyperbolic. The turbulent state is then treated as an excitation of the
equilibrium laminar state due to the non-linear interplay between dissipation

and first of its class to be extensively monitored by Kepler for its pulsation
properties. Fitting the observed oscillation frequencies of KIC 08626021 to a
model can yield insights into its otherwise-hidden internal structure.
Template-based white dwarf models choose a luminosity profile where the
luminosity is proportional to the enclosed mass, $L_r \propto M_r$, independent
of the effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$. Evolutionary models of young white
dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim$ 25,000 K suggest neutrino emission gives rise
to luminosity profiles with $L_r$ $\not\propto$ $M_r$. We explore this contrast
by comparing the oscillation frequencies between two nearly identical white
dwarf models: one with an enforced $L_r \propto M_r$ luminosity profile and the
other with a luminosity profile determined by the star's previous evolution
history. We find the low order g-mode frequencies differ by up to $\simeq$ 70
$\mu$Hz over the range of Kepler observations for KIC 08626021. This suggests
that by neglecting the proper thermal structure of the star (e.g., accounting
for the effect of plasmon neutrino losses), the model frequencies calculated by
using an $L_r \propto M_r$ profile may have uncorrected, effectively-random
errors at the level of tens of $\mu$Hz. A mean frequency difference of 30
$\mu$Hz, based on linearly extrapolating published results, suggests a template
model uncertainty in the fit precision of $\simeq$ 12% in white dwarf mass,

discussion and effort across a broad range of perspectives: technological,
legislative/policy, education, and publishing. Discussion on these topics is
not new, but the need to adopt standards for reproducibility of claims made
based on computational results is now clear to researchers, publishers and
policymakers alike. Many technologies exist to support and promote reproduction
of computational results: containerisation tools like Docker, literate
programming approaches such as Sweave, knitr, iPython or cloud environments
like Amazon Web Services. But these technologies are tied to specific
programming languages (e.g. Sweave/knitr to R; iPython to Python) or to
platforms (e.g. Docker for 64-bit Linux environments only). To date, no single
approach is able to span the broad range of technologies and platforms
represented in computational biology and biotechnology.
  To enable reproducibility across computational biology, we demonstrate an
approach and provide a set of tools that is suitable for all computational work
and is not tied to a particular programming language or platform. We present
published examples from a series of papers in different areas of computational
biology, spanning the major languages and technologies in the field
(Python/R/MATLAB/Fortran/C/Java). Our approach produces a transparent and
flexible process for replication and recomputation of results. Ultimately, its
most valuable aspect is the decoupling of methods in computational biology from
their implementation. Separating the 'how' (method) of a publication from the
'where' (implementation) promotes genuinely open science and benefits the

binary images. First, our method stylizes the stroke-based geometric shape like

image. Second, the composition of the stylized geometric shape and a background
image is explored. To accomplish the task, we propose legibility-preserving
structure and texture transfer algorithms, which progressively narrow the
visual differences between the binary image and the style image. The
stylization is then followed by a context-aware layout design algorithm, where
cues for both seamlessness and aesthetics are employed to determine the optimal
layout of the shape in the background. Given the layout, the binary image is
seamlessly embedded into the background by texture synthesis under a
context-aware boundary constraint. According to the contents of binary images,
our method can be applied to many fields. We show that the proposed method is
capable of addressing the unsupervised text stylization problem and is superior
to state-of-the-art style transfer methods in automatic artistic typography

points of the complexified Euclidean action, which can be viewed as bound
states of a pair of fractional instantons with opposite topological charges. We
first derive the bion solutions by solving the equation of motion in the model
with a potential which simulates an interaction induced by fermions in the
$\mathbb C P^{N-1}$ quantum mechanics. The bion solutions have quasi-moduli
parameters corresponding to the relative distance and phase between the
constituent fractional instantons. By summing over the Kaluza-Klein modes of
the quantum fluctuations around the bion backgrounds, we find that the
effective action for the quasi-moduli parameters is renormalized and becomes a
function of the dynamical scale (or the renormalized coupling constant). Based
on the renormalized effective action, we obtain the semiclassical bion
contribution in a weak coupling limit by making use of the Lefschetz thimble
method. We find that the non-perturbative contribution vanishes in the
supersymmetric case and it has an imaginary ambiguity which is consistent with
the expected infrared renormalon ambiguity in non-supersymmetric cases. This is
the first explicit result indicating the relation between the complex bion and

object has latent vectors, and the probability of neighbor objects is modeled
by the inner-product of the latent vectors, where the neighbors are generated
by short random walks over the relations. The latent vectors are estimated by
maximizing the likelihood of the neighbors for each dataset. The estimated
latent vectors contain hidden structural information of each object in the

latent vectors for all the datasets onto a common latent space shared across
all datasets by matching the distributions while preserving the structural
information. The projection matrix is estimated by minimizing the distance
between the latent vector distributions with an orthogonality regularizer. To
represent the distributions effectively, we use the kernel embedding of
distributions that hold high-order moment information about a distribution as
an element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which enables us to calculate
the distance between the distributions without density estimation. The

by a novel generalization bound that shows a tradeoff in classifier accuracy

skeleton prior, which provides a better initialization for tracking articulated

correct correspondences for human performance capture. We also contribute a
synthetic dataset which provides ground truth locations for frame-by-frame

Stripe 82X, we build a sample of X-ray detected quasars to investigate the
relation between UV/optical variation amplitude ($\sigma_{rms}$) and X-ray
loudness. We find that quasars with more intense X-ray radiation (com- pared to
bolometric luminosity) are more variable in UV/optical. Such correlation
remains highly significant after excluding the effect of other parameters
including luminosity, black hole mass, Ed- dington ratio, redshift, rest-frame
wavelength (i.e., through partial correlation analyses). We further find the
intrinsic link between X-ray loudness and UV/optical variation is gradually
more prominent on longer timescales (up to 10 years in the observed frame), but
tends to disappear at timescales < 100 days. This suggests a slow and long-term
underlying physical process. The X-ray reprocessing paradigm, in which
UV/optical variation is produced by a variable central X-ray emission
illuminating the accretion disk, is thus disfavored. The discovery points to an
interesting scheme that both the X-ray corona heating and UV/optical variation
is quasars are closely associated with magnetic disc turbulence, and the
innermost disc turbulence (where corona heating occurs) correlates with the
slow turbulence at larger radii (where UV/optical emission is produced).

entanglement renormalization ansatz and quantum error correction. We explicitly
illustrate its potential with two examples. First, QCNN is used to accurately
recognize quantum states associated with 1D symmetry-protected topological
phases. We numerically demonstrate that a QCNN trained on a small set of
exactly solvable points can reproduce the phase diagram over the entire
parameter regime and also provide an exact, analytical QCNN solution. As a
second application, we utilize QCNNs to devise a quantum error correction
scheme optimized for a given error model. We provide a generic framework to
simultaneously optimize both encoding and decoding procedures and find that the
resultant scheme significantly outperforms known quantum codes of comparable
complexity. Finally, potential experimental realization and generalizations of

  Kernel and Improved Approximation","An extended abstract of this work will appear in SOSA'19",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Maximum $k$-Vertex Cover (Max $k$-VC), the input is an edge-weighted graph
$G$ and an integer $k$, and the goal is to find a subset $S$ of $k$ vertices
that maximizes the total weight of edges covered by $S$. Here we say that an
edge is covered by $S$ iff at least one of its endpoints lies in $S$.
  We present an FPT approximation scheme (FPT-AS) that runs in
$(1/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$ time for the problem, which improves upon Gupta
et al.'s $(k/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$-time FPT-AS [SODA'18, FOCS'18]. Our
algorithm is simple: just use brute force to find the best $k$-vertex subset
among the $O(k/\epsilon)$ vertices with maximum weighted degrees.
  Our algorithm naturally yields an efficient approximate kernelization scheme
of $O(k/\epsilon)$ vertices; previously, an $O(k^5/\epsilon^2)$-vertex
approximate kernel is only known for the unweighted version of Max $k$-VC
[Lokshtanov et al., STOC'17]. Interestingly, this has an application outside of
parameterized complexity: using our approximate kernelization as a
preprocessing step, we can directly apply Raghavendra and Tan's SDP-based
algorithm for 2SAT with cardinality constraint [SODA'12] to give an
$0.92$-approximation for Max $k$-VC in polynomial time. This improves upon
Feige and Langberg's algorithm [J. Algorithms'01] which yields $(0.75 +
\delta)$-approximation for some (unspecified) constant $\delta > 0$.
  We also consider the minimization version (Min $k$-VC), where the goal is to
minimize the total weight of edges covered by $S$. We provide an FPT-AS for Min
$k$-VC with similar running time of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$, which again
improves on a $(k/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$-time FPT-AS of Gupta et al. On the
other hand, we show that there is unlikely a polynomial size approximate
kernelization for Min $k$-VC for any factor less than two.

Collective Strategies with Master-Slave Mechanism (CSMSM) defeat Tit-for-Tat

identifies kin members by means of a handshaking mechanism. If the opponent is
identified as non-kin, a CSMSM will always defect. Once two CSMSMs meet, they
play master and slave roles. A mater defects and a slave cooperates in order to
maximize the master's payoff. CSMSM outperforms non-collective strategies in
spatial IPD even if there is only a small cluster of CSMSMs in the population.
The existence and performance of CSMSM in spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma

with stellar noise. We confirm the planet with a new compilation and analysis
of precise RV data spanning 30 years, and combine it with upper limits from our
direct imaging search, the most sensitive ever performed. The deep images were
taken in the Ms band (4.7$\mu$m) with the vortex coronagraph recently installed
in W.M. Keck Observatory's infrared camera NIRC2, which opens a sensitive
window for planet searches around nearby adolescent systems. The RV data and
direct imaging upper limit maps were combined in an innovative joint Bayesian
analysis, providing new constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the
elusive planet. $\epsilon$ Eridani b has a mass of $0.78^{+0.38}_{-0.12}$

of hot channels usually takes several to dozens of hours during which two
J-shape sheared arcades gradually evolve into sigmoidal hot channels, then they
keep stable for tens of minutes or hours and erupt. While the low-lying
filaments show no significant change. \textbf{We construct a series of magnetic
field models and find that the best-fit preflare models contain magnetic flux
ropes with hyperbolic flux tubes (HFTs). The field lines above the HFT
correspond to the high-lying hot channel, while those below the HFT surround
the underlying filaments. In particular, the continuous and long field lines
representing the flux rope located above the HFT match the observed hot
channels well in three events. While for SOL2014-04-18 event, the flux bundle
that mimics the observed hot channel is located above the flux rope. The flux
rope axis lies in a height range of 19.8 Mm and 46 Mm above the photosphere for
the four events, among which the flux rope axis in SOL2012-07-12 event has a
maximum height, which probably explains why it is often considered as a
double-decker structure. Our modeling suggests that the high-lying hot channel
may be formed by magnetic reconnections between sheared field lines occurring
above the filament prior to eruption.

very little is known about the intrinsic geometry of MSTs of most standard

space has only been identified in the case of the complete graph [5]. In this
work, we show that the MST constructed by assigning i.i.d. continuous
edge-weights to either the random (simple) $3$-regular graph or the $3$-regular
configuration model on $n$ vertices, endowed with the tree distance scaled by
$n^{-1/3}$ and the uniform probability measure on the vertices, converges in
distribution with respect to Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology to a random
compact metric measure space. Further, this limiting space has the same law as
the scaling limit of the MST of the complete graph identified in [5] up to a
scaling factor of $6^{1/3}$. Our proof relies on a novel argument that proceeds
via a comparison between a $3$-regular configuration model and the largest

instead propose sufficient input subsets that identify minimal subsets of

that globally govern a model's decision-making can also be revealed by
searching for clusters of such input patterns across many data points. Our
approach is conceptually straightforward, entirely model-agnostic, simply
implemented using instance-wise backward selection, and able to produce more
concise rationales than existing techniques. We demonstrate the utility of our

imperceptible but intentionally-designed perturbations to the input can cause
incorrect output of the networks. In this paper, using information geometry, we
provide a reasonable explanation for the vulnerability of deep learning models.
By considering the data space as a non-linear space with the Fisher information
metric induced from a neural network, we first propose an adversarial attack
algorithm termed one-step spectral attack (OSSA). The method is described by a
constrained quadratic form of the Fisher information matrix, where the optimal
adversarial perturbation is given by the first eigenvector, and the model
vulnerability is reflected by the eigenvalues. The larger an eigenvalue is, the
more vulnerable the model is to be attacked by the corresponding eigenvector.
Taking advantage of the property, we also propose an adversarial detection
method with the eigenvalues serving as characteristics. Both our attack and
detection algorithms are numerically optimized to work efficiently on large
datasets. Our evaluations show superior performance compared with other
methods, implying that the Fisher information is a promising approach to
investigate the adversarial attacks and defenses.

the detection of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia and their treatment

induce unnecessary shocks and, even more egregious, prevent required therapy.
In this paper, we present a formal approach for the synthesis of ICD
reprogramming attacks that are both effective, i.e., lead to fundamental
changes in the required therapy, and stealthy, i.e., involve minimal changes to
the nominal ICD parameters. We focus on the discrimination algorithm underlying
Boston Scientific devices (one of the principal ICD manufacturers) and
formulate the synthesis problem as one of multi-objective optimization. Our
solution technique is based on an Optimization Modulo Theories encoding of the

to the effectiveness-stealthiness tradeoff (i.e., lie along the corresponding
Pareto front). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to derive
systematic ICD reprogramming attacks designed to maximize therapy disruption
while minimizing detection. To evaluate our technique, we employ an extensive
dataset of synthetic EGMs (cardiac signals), each generated with a prescribed

  Measures","15 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CC cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we investigate into energy complexity, a Boolean function
measure related to circuit complexity. Given a circuit $\mathcal{C}$ over the
standard basis $\{\vee_2,\wedge_2,\neg\}$, the energy complexity of
$\mathcal{C}$, denoted by $\mathrm{EC}(\mathcal{C})$, is the maximum number of
its activated inner gates over all inputs. The energy complexity of a Boolean
function $f$, denoted by $\mathrm{EC}(f)$, is the minimum of
$\mathrm{EC}(\mathcal{C})$ over all circuits $\mathcal{C}$ computing $f$. This
concept has attracted lots of attention in literature. Recently, Dinesh, Otiv,
and Sarma [COCOON'18] gave $\mathrm{EC}(f)$ an upper bound in terms of the
decision tree complexity, $\mathrm{EC}(f)=O(\mathrm{D}(f)^3)$. They also showed
that $\mathrm{EC}(f)\leq 3n-1$, where $n$ is the input size. Recall that the
minimum size of circuit to compute $f$ could be as large as $2^n/n$. We improve
their upper bounds by showing that
$\mathrm{EC}(f)\leq\min\{\frac12\mathrm{D}(f)^2+O(\mathrm{D}(f)),n+2\mathrm{D}(f)-2\}$.
For the lower bound, Dinesh, Otiv, and Sarma defined positive sensitivity, a
complexity measure denoted by $\mathrm{psens}(f)$, and showed that
$\mathrm{EC}(f)\ge\frac{1}{3}\mathrm{psens}(f)$. They asked whether
$\mathrm{EC}(f)$ can also be lower bounded by a polynomial of $\mathrm{D}(f)$.
In this paper we affirm it by proving
$\mathrm{EC}(f)=\Omega(\sqrt{\mathrm{D}(f)})$. For non-degenerated functions
with input size $n$, we give another lower bound
$\mathrm{EC}(f)=\Omega(\log{n})$. All these three lower bounds are incomparable
to each other. Besides, we also examine the energy complexity of $\mathtt{OR}$
functions and $\mathtt{ADDRESS}$ functions, which implies the tightness of our
two lower bounds respectively. In addition, the former one answers another open

to other experiments. In this paper, we explore the prospect of searching for
the continuous gravitational waves generated by boson clouds around known black
holes. We carefully study the predicted waveforms and use the latest-available
numerical results to model signals for different black-hole and boson
parameters. We then demonstrate the suitability of a specific method (hidden
Markov model tracking) to efficiently search for such signals, even when the
source parameters are not perfectly known and allowing for some uncertainty in
theoretical predictions. We empirically study this method's sensitivity and
computational cost in the context of boson signals, finding that it will be
possible to target remnants from compact-binary mergers localized with at least
three instruments. For signals from scalar clouds, we also compute detection
horizons for future detectors (Advanced LIGO, LIGO Voyager, Cosmic Explorer and
the Einstein Telescope). Among other results, we find that, after one year of
observation, an Advanced LIGO detector at design sensitivity could detect these
sources up to over 100 Mpc, while Cosmic Explorer could reach over $10^4$ Mpc.
These projections offer a more complete picture than previous estimates based
on analytic approximations to the signal power or idealized search strategies.
Finally, we discuss specific implications for the followup of compact-binary
coalescences and black holes in x-ray binaries. Along the way, we review the

superlinearly for the Enet criterion and achieves an optimal local convergence
rate for the LASSO criterion, i.e., SNAP converges in one step at the cost of
two matrix-vector multiplication per iteration. Under certain regularity
conditions on the design matrix and the minimum magnitude of the nonzero
elements of the target regression coefficients, we show that SNAP hits a
solution with the same signs as the regression coefficients and achieves a
sharp estimation error bound in finite steps with high probability. The

obey Wigner-Dyson statistics and the OTOC shows distinctive behaviors at
different times: Its early-time dynamics is characterized by an exponential
growth, while the approach to its saturated value at late times obeys a power
law. The temperature scaling of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ shows that
while it is well below the conjectured bound $2\pi T$ at high temperatures,
$\lambda_L$ approaches the bound at low temperatures and for large number of

obtain generic conclusions on the global dynamics of a system over a wide range

features of the braneworld model from a more global perspective, here, we
investigate the global cosmological dynamics of the braneworld model using
dynamical system techniques. We first analyze the case where there is just a
normal matter on the brane and then extend the analysis to the case with an
extra scalar field also trapped on the brane. In the presence of a scalar
field, potentials belonging to different classes are considered. The stability
behavior of critical points is examined using linear stability analysis and
when necessary center manifold theory as well as numerical perturbation
techniques are also used. To understand the global dynamics of a dynamical

properties of all possible critical points. Applying dynamical system analysis,
we found that brane gravity is consistent with observed actions of the

choosing such features from multiple kernels in a greedy fashion. Our method
sequentially selects these explicit features from a set of candidate features
using a correlation metric. We establish an out-of-sample error bound capturing
the trade-off between the error in terms of explicit features (approximation

verifies that when the (best) underlying data model is sparse enough, i.e., the
spectral error is negligible, one can control the test error with a small
number of explicit features, that can scale poly-logarithmically with data. Our

as analyzed by Serghei et al.; with deviations on the low frequency side. The
proportionality between the relaxation rate of the dynamic glass transition and
the charge carrier hopping rate reflects the nature of charge transport as
glass transition assisted hopping. Hereby, the PIL under study exposes the
highest dc-conductivity values observed for this class of materials below 100
oC so far, and for the first time a conductivity increase by rising degree of
polymerization. The comparison of the polymeric Ionic Liquids under study with
others implies conclusions on the design of novel highly conductive PILs.

field are analyzed in the Hamiltonian formalism. For the first type of mimetic
gravity, the Ricci scalar only couples to the mimetic field and we demonstrate
the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) is three. Then in both Einstein frame
and Jordan frame, we perform the Hamiltonian analysis for the extended mimetic
gravity with higher derivatives directly coupled to the Ricci scalar. We show
that different from previous studies working at the cosmological perturbation
level, where only three propagating DOFs show up, this generalized mimetic
model, in general, has four DOFs. To understand this discrepancy, we consider
the unitary gauge and find out that the number of DOFs reduces to three. We
conclude that the reason why this system looks peculiar is that the Dirac
matrix of all secondary constraints becomes singular in the unitary gauge,
resulting in extra secondary constraints and thus reducing the number of DOFs.
Furthermore, we give a simple example of a dynamic system to illustrate how
gauge choice can affect the number of secondary constraints as well as the DOFs
when the rank of the Dirac matrix is gauge dependent.

direction utilize uniform grid discretizations of the integral that facilitate
the use of FFT for $O(n\log n)$ computations on a grid of size $n$. In general,
however, the resulting error converges slowly with increasing $n$ when the
integrand does not have a smooth periodic extension. Such extensions, in fact,
are often discontinuous and, therefore, their approximations by truncated
Fourier series suffer from Gibb's oscillations. In this paper, we present and
analyze an $O(n\log n)$ scheme, based on a Fourier extension approach for
removing such unwanted oscillations, that not only converges with high-order
but is also relatively simple to implement. We include a theoretical error
analysis as well as a wide variety of numerical experiments to demonstrate its

Realize a set of behaviors, namely trot, walk, gallop and bound from these
kinematic motion primitives in our custom four legged robot, called the
`Stoch'. D-RL is a data driven approach, which has been shown to be very
effective for realizing all kinds of robust locomotion behaviors, both in
simulation and in experiment. On the other hand, kMPs are known to capture the
underlying structure of walking and yield a set of derived behaviors. We first
generate walking gaits from D-RL, which uses policy gradient based approaches.
We then analyze the resulting walking by using principal component analysis. We
observe that the kMPs extracted from PCA followed a similar pattern
irrespective of the type of gaits generated. Leveraging on this underlying
structure, we then realize walking in Stoch by a straightforward reconstruction
of joint trajectories from kMPs. This type of methodology improves the
transferability of these gaits to real hardware, lowers the computational
overhead on-board, and also avoids multiple training iterations by generating a
set of derived behaviors from a single learned gait.

emissions, we estimate the characteristic time scales for the emissions, and
evaluate whether the observed differences between UV and IR emissions can be
understood by the differences in the emission time scales. Based on the model
results, the UV aurora at Jupiter and Saturn is directly related to excitation
by auroral electrons that impact molecular H2, occurring over a time scale of
0.01 sec. The IR auroral emission involves several time scales: while the
auroral ionization process and IR transitions occur over < 0.01 sec, the time
scale for ion chemistry is much longer at 0.01-10000 sec. Associated
atmospheric phenomena such as temperature variations and circulation are
effective over time scales of > 10000 sec. That is, for events that have a time
scale of ~100 sec, the ion chemistry, present in the IR but absent in the UV

solving dynamic programs in continuous state and action spaces. The key idea is
to approximate the output of the Bellman operator at a particular state by the
optimal value of a convex program. The approximate Bellman operator has a
computational advantage because it involves a convex optimization problem in
the case of control-affine systems and convex costs. Using this feature, we
propose a simple dynamic programming algorithm to evaluate the approximate
value function at pre-specified grid points by solving convex optimization
problems in each iteration. We show that the proposed method approximates the
optimal value function with a uniform convergence property in the case of
convex optimal value functions. We also propose an interpolation-free design
method for a control policy, of which performance converges uniformly to the
optimum as the grid resolution becomes finer. When a nonlinear control-affine
system is considered, the convex optimization approach provides an approximate
policy with a provable suboptimality bound. For general cases, the proposed
convex formulation of dynamic programming operators can be modified as a
nonconvex bi-level program, in which the inner problem is a linear program,
without losing uniform convergence properties.

cosmological probes, the need for well-defined cluster samples is critical. The
XXL Survey has been specifically designed to provide a well characterised
sample of some 500 X-ray detected clusters suitable for cosmological studies.
The main goal of present article is to make public and describe the properties
of the cluster catalogue in its present state, as well as of associated
catalogues as super-clusters and fossil groups. We release a sample containing
365 clusters in total. We give the details of the follow-up observations and
explain the procedure adopted to validate the cluster spectroscopic redshifts.
Considering the whole XXL cluster sample, we have provided two types of
selection, both complete in a particular sense: one based on flux-morphology
criteria, and an alternative based on the [0.5-2] keV flux within one arcmin of
the cluster centre. We have also provided X-ray temperature measurements for
80$\%$ of the clusters having a flux larger than 9$\times$10$^{-15}$$\rm
\thinspace erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$. Our cluster sample extends from z$\sim$0
to z$\sim$1.2, with one cluster at z$\sim$2. Clusters were identified through a
mean number of six spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. Our updated
luminosity function and luminosity-temperature relation are compatible with our
previous determinations based on the 100 brightest clusters, but show smaller
uncertainties. We also present an enlarged list of super-clusters and a sample
of 18 possible fossil groups. This intermediate publication is the last before
the final release of the complete XXL cluster catalogue when the ongoing C2
cluster spectroscopic follow-up is complete. It provides a unique inventory of
medium-mass clusters over a 50~\dd\ area out to z$\sim$1.

significant efforts have been made to exploit attention schemes to advance

target objects undergoing large appearance changes. Attention maps facilitate
visual tracking by selectively paying attention to temporal robust features.
Existing tracking-by-detection approaches mainly use additional attention
modules to generate feature weights as the classifiers are not equipped with
such mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a reciprocative learning algorithm
to exploit visual attention for training deep classifiers. The proposed
algorithm consists of feed-forward and backward operations to generate
attention maps, which serve as regularization terms coupled with the original
classification loss function for training. The deep classifier learns to attend
to the regions of target objects robust to appearance changes. Extensive
experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed attentive
tracking method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.

appear similar, one produced a terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF) so bright that
it paralyzed the gamma-ray detectors while it was occurring, and could be
observed only via the weaker flux of neutrons created in its wake, while the
other produced no detectable TGF gamma-rays at all. The ratio between the
indirectly derived gamma-ray fluence for the TGF and the 95% confidence
gamma-ray upper limit for the gamma-ray quiet flash is a factor of
$1\times10^7$. With the only two observations of this type providing such
dramatically different results -- a TGF probably as bright as those seen from
space and a powerful upper limit -- we recognize that weak, sub-luminous TGFs
in this situation are probably not common, and we quantify this conclusion.
While the gamma-ray quiet flash appeared to have a faster leader and more
powerful initial continuous current pulse than the flash that produced a TGF,
the TGF-producing flash occurred during a weak gamma-ray ""glow"", while the
gamma-ray quiet flash did not, implying a higher electric field aloft when the
TGF was produced. We suggest that the field in the high-field region approached

neural network using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised
training procedure over a large dataset of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder
latent space provides a meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional
description of each image. We then presented several thousand face images to
human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel
fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied
this mapping to novel test images, turning the obtained fMRI patterns into VAE
latent codes, and ultimately the codes into face reconstructions. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluation of the reconstructions revealed robust pairwise
decoding (>95% correct), and a strong improvement relative to a baseline model
(PCA decomposition). Furthermore, this brain decoding model can readily be
recycled to probe human face perception along many dimensions of interest; for
example, the technique allowed for accurate gender classification, and even to
decode which face was imagined, rather than seen by the subject. We hypothesize
that the latent space of modern deep learning generative models could serve as
a valid approximation for human brain representations.

different kinematic structure that reaches higher velocities/dispersions. We

is compatible with a high dynamical mass close to those implied by the standard
stellar-to-halo-mass ratio (SHMR). The analysis relies on a convenient form for
the distribution function (DF) of projected phase space data, capturing
non-gaussian features in the spread of true velocities of the mass tracers. A
key ingredient is tidal stripping by the gravity of the apparently nearby
larger galaxy, NGC 1052. Tidal stripping decreases the range of velocities of
mass tracers, while only mildly lowering the total mass inside the trimming
radius $r_{tr}$. The analysis is performed assuming halo profiles consistent
with simulations of the $\Lambda$CDM model. For the fiducial value $r_{tr}=10$
kpc, we find that the virial mass of the pre-trimmed halo is $M<1.6\times
10^{10}M_\odot$ at $2\sigma $ ($95\%$) and $M<8.6\times 10^{9}M_\odot$ at
$1.64\sigma$ ($90\%$). For the mass within 10 kpc we obtain,
$M_\mathrm{10kpc}<3.9\times 10^{9}M_\odot$ and $<2.9\times 10^{9}M_\odot$ at
$2\sigma$ and $1.64\sigma$, respectively. The $2\sigma$ upper limit on the
virial mass is roughly a factor of 3-5 below the mean SHMR relation.Taking
$r_{tr}=20$ kpc, lowers the $2\sigma$ virial mass limits by a factor of $\sim 4
$, bringing our results closer to those of Wasserman et al. (2018) without
their SHMR prior.

edge-connectivity recognition algorithm in near-linear time. A crucial step in

$n$ vertices whose contractions leave a multigraph with $\tilde{O}(n/\delta)$
vertices and $\tilde{O}(n)$ edges that preserves all non-trivial min-cuts of
$G$, where $\delta$ is the minimum degree of $G$ and $\tilde{O}$ hides
logarithmic factors.
  We present a simple argument that improves this contraction-based sparsifier
by eliminating the poly-logarithmic factors, that is, we show a
contraction-based sparsification that leaves $O(n/\delta)$ vertices and $O(n)$
edges, preserves all non-trivial min-cuts and can be computed in near-linear
time $\tilde{O}(m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$. We also obtain
that every simple graph has $O((n/\delta)^2)$ non-trivial min-cuts.
  Our approach allows to represent all non-trivial min-cuts of a graph by a
cactus representation, whose cactus graph has $O(n/\delta)$ vertices. Moreover,
this cactus representation can be derived directly from the standard cactus
representation of all min-cuts in linear time. We apply this compact structure
to show that all min-cuts can be explicitly listed in $\tilde{O}(m) + O(n^2 /
\delta)$ time for every simple graph, which improves the previous best time
bound $O(nm)$ given by Gusfield and Naor.

(ODE) models. Due to complex relationships between parameters and states the
use of standard techniques such as nonlinear least squares can lead to the

approximations of the true process and the influence of misspecification on
inference is often neglected. Methods based on control theory have emerged to
regularize the ill posed problem of parameter estimation in this context.
However, they are computationally intensive and rely on a nonparametric state
estimator known to be biased in the sparse sample case. In this paper, we
construct criteria based on discrete control theory which are computationally
efficient and bypass the presmoothing step of signal estimation while retaining
the benefits of control theory for estimation. We describe how the estimation
problem can be turned into a control one and present the numerical methods used
to solve it. We show convergence of our estimator in the parametric and
well-specified case. For small sample sizes, numerical experiments with models
containing poorly identifiable parameters and with various sources of model
misspecification demonstrate the acurracy of our method. We finally test our
approach on a real data example.

introduced by data-inherent perturbations, which significantly reduce the

modularized temporal filter, which stabilizes an abstract feature
representation of a single-frame segmentation model using information of
previous time steps. Our filter module splits the filter task into multiple
less complex and more interpretable subtasks. The basic structure of the filter
is inspired by a Bayes estimator consisting of a prediction and an update step.
To make the prediction more transparent, we implement it using a geometric
projection and estimate its parameters. This additionally enables the
decomposition of the filter task into static representation filtering and
low-dimensional motion filtering. Our model can cope with missing frames and is
trainable in an end-to-end fashion. Using photorealistic, synthetic video data,
we show the ability of the proposed architecture to overcome data-inherent

$r$-MD in which the distance between two vertices is considered as infinite if
the real distance exceeds $r$. Note that while IC = 1-IC and LD = 1-LD, we have
MD = $\infty$-MD; we say that MD is not local
  In this article, we prove computational lower bounds for several problems
included in Distance Identifying Set by providing generic reductions from
(Planar) Hitting Set to the meta-problem. We mainly focus on two families of
problem from the meta-problem: the first one, called bipartite gifted local,
contains $r$-IC, $r$-LD and $r$-MD for each positive integer $r$ while the
second one, called 1-layered, contains LD, MD and $r$-MD for each positive
integer $r$. We have:
  - the 1-layered problems are NP-hard even in bipartite apex graphs,
  - the bipartite gifted local problems are NP-hard even in bipartite planar
graphs,
  - assuming ETH, all these problems cannot be solved in $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ when
restricted to bipartite planar or apex graph, respectively, and they cannot be
solved in $2^{o(n)}$ on bipartite graphs,
  - even restricted to bipartite graphs, they do not admit parameterized
algorithms in $2^{O(k)}.n^{O(1)}$ except if W[0] = W[2]. Here $k$ is the

climate change is Arctic Amplification (AA). This is the more rapid change in
the surface air temperature (SAT) in the Arctic compared to some wider
reference region, such as the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mean. Many different
metrics have been developed to quantify the degree of AA based on SAT
anomalies, trends and variability. The use of different metrics, as well as the
choice of dataset to use can affect conclusions about the magnitude and
temporal variability of AA. Here we review the established metrics of AA to see
how well they agree upon the temporal signature of AA, such as the
multi-decadal variability, and assess the consistency in these metrics across
different commonly-used datasets which cover both the early and late 20th
century warming in the Arctic. We find the NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis most
closely matches the observations when using metrics based upon SAT trends (A2),
variability (A3) and regression (A4) of the SAT anomalies, and the ERA 20th
Century Reanalysis is closest to the observations in the SAT anomalies (A1) and
variability of SAT anomalies (A3). However, there are large seasonal
differences in the consistency between datasets. Moreover, the largest
differences between the century-long reanalysis products and observations are
during the early warming period, likely due to the sparseness of the
observations in the Arctic at that time. In the modern warming period, the high
density of observations strongly constrains all the reanalysis products,
whether they include satellite observations or only surface observations. Thus,
all the reanalysis and observation products produce very similar magnitudes and
temporal variability in the degree of AA during the recent warming period.

using ALMA and ZIMPOL to probe the distribution of gas and large dust grains,
respectively. The polarized light images show dust around Mira~A, the companion
(Mira~B) and in a trail that connects the two sources. ALMA reveals that dust
around Mira~A is contained in a high-gas-density region with a significant
fraction of the polarized light arising from its edge. We constrained the gas
density, temperature, and velocity within a few stellar radii from the star by
modelling the CO $v=1, J=3-2$ line. We find a mass $(\sim 3.8 \pm 1.3) \times
10^{-4}~M_\odot$ to be contained between the stellar millimetre photosphere,
$R^{\rm 338~GHz}_\star$, and $4~R^{\rm 338~GHz}_\star$. Our best-fit models
with lower masses also reproduce the $^{13}$CO $v=0, J=3-2$ line emission from
this region. We find TiO$_2$ and AlO abundances corresponding to 4.5% and $<
0.1$% of the total titanium and aluminium expected for a solar-composition gas.
The low abundance of AlO allows for efficient Al depletion into dust already
very close to the star, as expected from thermal dust emission observations and
theoretical calculations of Mira variables. We constrain the presence of
aluminium oxide grains based on the scattered light observations and our
gas-phase model. We find that aluminium oxide grains can account for a
significant fraction of the total aluminium atoms in this region only if the
grains have sizes $\lesssim 0.02~\mu$m. This is an order of magnitude smaller
than the maximum sizes predicted by dust-formation and wind-driving models.

freezing temperature $\delta T_{\rm f} \simeq 0.017$, obtained from the AC
susceptibility data reflects the formation of cluster spin-glass states. The
frequency dependence of $T_{\rm f}$ is also analyzed within the framework of
dynamic scaling laws. The analysis using power law yields a time constant for a
single spin flip $\tau* \simeq 1.1\times10^{-10}$~s and critical exponent
$z\nu^{\prime}=4.2\pm0.2$. On the other hand, the Vogel-Fulcher (VF) law yields

temperature $T_{\rm 0}=21.1\pm0.1$~K, and an activation energy $E_{\rm

non-zero value of $T_{\rm 0}$ provide further evidence for the cluster
spin-glass behaviour. The magnetic field dependent $T_{\rm f}$ follows the de
Almeida-Thouless line with a non-mean-field type instability, reflecting either
a different universality class or strong anisotropy in the spin system. A
detailed non-equilibrium dynamics study via relaxation and memory effect

render a cluster spin-glass behaviour which is triggered by magnetic
frustration due to competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions

relaxation with respect to the change in temperature, below $T_{\rm f}$ can be
explained by the hierarchical model.

  It has been recently shown that SISO MMSE DFE with dynamic filters (i.e.

category, thanks to sequential estimation of data symbols [1].
  However the dependence of filters on the feedback incurs high amount of

provide an attractive alternative for computational complexity-performance
trade-off.
  However, the latter category of receivers faces a fundamental design issue on

  To address this issue, a novel approach to decision feedback reliability
estimation through online prediction is proposed and applied for SISO FIR DFE

  This novel method for filter computation is shown to improve detection

annealing is shown to reduce the overall doping whilst increasing the overall
strain, indicating and increased interaction between graphene and hBN.
Surprisingly, we find that the two contacts configurations lead to different
twist-angles in graphene/hBN superlattices, which converge to the same value
after thermal annealing. This observation confirms the self-locking mechanism
of graphene/hBN superlattices also in the presence of strain gradients. Our
experiments may have profound implications in the development of future
electronic devices based on heterostructures and provide a new mechanism to
induce complex strain patterns in 2D materials.

our knowledge, this is the first time a quantum circuit-depth lower bound is
given for unique ground state of a {\it gapped} local Hamiltonian. Providing a
lower bound in this case seems more challenging, since such systems exhibit
exponential decay of correlations and standard lower bound techniques do not
apply. We prove our lower bound by introducing the new notion of
$\gamma$-separation, and analyzing its behavior using algebraic topology
arguments. We extend out methods also to a wide class of polygonal complexes
beyond the sphere, and prove a circuit-depth lower bound whenever the complex
does not have a small ""bottle neck"" (in a sense which we define). Here our
lower bound on the circuit depth is only $\Omega(logloglog(n))$. We conjecture
that the correct lower bound is at least $\Omega(log(log(n))$, but this seems
harder to achieve due to the possibility of hyperbolic geometry. For general
simplicial complexes the lack of geometrical restriction on the gates becomes
considerably more problematic than for the sphere, and we need to thoroughly
modify the original argument in order to get a meaningful bound. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time the class of trivial quantum states is

Swift Observatory from December 2016 until October 2017. The X-ray hardness
ratio and timing evolution indicate that the source approached the soft state
three times during the outburst, even though it never reached the canonical
soft spectral state. Thus, GRS 1716-249 increases the number of black hole
transients showing outbursts with ""failed"" state transition. During the
softening events, XRT and BAT broadband spectral modeling, performed with
thermal Comptonization plus a multicolor disc black-body, showed a photon index
(Gamma < 2) and an inner disc temperature (kTin = 0.2-0.5 keV) characteristic
of the hard intermediate state. This is in agreement with the root mean square
amplitude of the flux variability (rms > 10%). We find that, coherently with a
scenario in which the disc moves closer to the compact object, the accretion
disc inner radius decreases with the increase of the inner disc temperature,
until a certain point when the temperature starts to increase at constant
radius. This, in addition with the spectral analysis results, suggests that
either the accretion disc reached the innermost stable circular orbit during
the hard intermediate state or the hot accretion flow might re-condensate in an
inner mini-disc. We report on the radio observations performed during the

creating K_s/(Y-K_s) Hess diagrams; the observed density excesses over the
local field population are used to classify the stellar populations. Our
analysis recovers all known star formation complexes in this pilot field (N44,
N51, N148 and N138) and for the first time reveals their true spatial extent.
In total, around 2260 PMS candidates with ages $\lesssim$ 10 Myr are found in
the pilot field. PMS structures, identified as areas with a significant density
excess of PMS candidates, display a power-law distribution of the number of
members with a slope of -0.86+-0.12. We find a clustering of the young stellar
populations along ridges and filaments where dust emission in the far-infrared
(FIR) (70 micron - 500 micron) is bright. Regions with young populations
lacking massive stars show a lesser degree of clustering and are usually
located in the outskirts of the star formation complexes. At short FIR
wavelengths (70 micron, 100 micron) we report a strong dust emission increase
in regions hosting young massive stars, which is less pronounced in regions

distribution of the subsurface petro-elastic properties by perturbing the model
parameter space through iterative stochastic sequential

petro-elastic properties is represented with the updated a posteriori variance
from an ensemble of the simulated realizations. Within this setting, the
large-scale geological (metaparameters) used to generate the petro-elastic
realizations, such as the spatial correlation model and the global a priori
distribution of the properties of interest, are assumed to be known and
stationary for the entire inversion domain. This assumption leads to
underestimation of the uncertainty associated with the inverted models. We
propose a practical framework to quantify uncertainty of the large-scale
geological parameters in seismic inversion. The framework couples
geostatistical seismic inversion with a stochastic adaptive sampling and
Bayesian inference of the metaparameters to provide a more accurate and
realistic prediction of uncertainty not restricted by heavy assumptions on
large-scale geological parameters. The proposed framework is illustrated with
both synthetic and real case studies. The results show the ability retrieve
more reliable acoustic impedance models with a more adequate uncertainty spread
when compared with conventional geostatistical seismic inversion techniques.
The proposed approach separately account for geological uncertainty at

essentially unresolved and isolated from other strong and compact emission
peaks. We detect SiO (5-4) emission that is marginally resolved and elongated
in a direction perpendicular to the large-scale outflow seen in the 13CO (2-1)
line using the main ALMA array in conjunction with the Atacama Compact Array
(ACA). Morphologically, the SiO appears to represent a disc-like structure.
Using parametric models we show that the position-velocity profile of the SiO
is consistent with the Keplerian rotation of a disc around an object between
10-30Mo in mass, only if there is also radial expansion from a separate
structure. The radial motion component can be interpreted as a disc wind from
the disc surface. Models with a central stellar object mass between 20 and 30Mo
are the most consistent with the stellar luminosity (100000 Lo) and indicative
of an O-type star. The H30a millimetre recombination line (231.9GHz) is also
detected, but spatially unresolved, and is indicative of a very compact, hot,
ionised region co-spatial with the dust continuum core. Accounting for all
observables, we suggest that G17.64 is consistent with a O-type young stellar
object in the final stages of protostellar assembly, driving a wind, but that
has not yet developed into a compact HII region. The existance and detection of
the disc in G17.64 is likely related to its isolated and possibly more evolved
nature, traits which may underpin discs in similar sources.

Stars can maintain their observable magnetic activity from the PMS
to the tip of the red giant branch. However, the number of known active giants
is much lower than active stars on the main sequence since on the giant branch
the stars spend only about 10% of their main sequence lifetime. Due to their
rapid evolution it is difficult to estimate the stellar parameters of giant
stars. A possibility for obtaining more reliable stellar parameters of an
active giant arises when it is a member of an eclipsing binary system.
  Aims. We have discovered EPIC 211759736, an active spotted giant star in an
eclipsing binary system during the Kepler K2 Campaign 5. The eclipsing nature
allows us to much better constrain the stellar parameters than in most cases of
active giant stars. Method. We have combined the K2 data with archival HATNet
and DASCH photometry, new spectroscopic radial velocity measurements, and a set
of follow-up ground-based BVRI photometric observations, to find the binary
system parameters as well as robust spot models for the giant at two different
epochs.
  Results. We determined the physical parameters of both stellar components and
provide a description of the rotational and long-term activity of the primary
component. The temperatures and luminosities of both components were examined
in the context of the HR diagram. We find that both the primary and the
secondary components deviate from the evolutionary tracks corresponding to
their masses in the sense that the stars appear in the diagram at lower masses
than their true masses.
  Conclusions. We further evaluate the proposition that active giants have
masses that are found to be generally higher by traditional methods than are
indicated by stellar evolution tracks in the HR diagram. A possible reason for
this discrepancy could be a strong magnetic field, since we see greater
differences in more active stars.

orthogonality constraints is usually regarded as an extremely difficult
mission, due to the low scalability of the orthonormalization procedure.
However, such demand is particularly huge in some application areas such as
materials computation. In this paper, we propose a proximal linearized
augmented Lagrangian algorithm (PLAM) for solving optimization problems with
orthogonality constraints. Unlike the classical augmented Lagrangian methods,
in our algorithm, the prime variables are updated by minimizing a proximal
linearized approximation of the augmented Lagrangian function, meanwhile the
dual variables are updated by a closed-form expression which holds at any
first-order stationary point. The orthonormalization procedure is only invoked
once at the last step of the above mentioned algorithm if high-precision
feasibility is needed. Consequently, the main parts of the proposed algorithm
can be parallelized naturally. We establish global subsequence convergence,
worst-case complexity and local convergence rate for PLAM under some mild
assumptions. To reduce the sensitivity of the penalty parameter, we put forward
a modification of PLAM, which is called parallelizable column-wise block
minimization of PLAM (PCAL). Numerical experiments in serial illustrate that
the novel updating rule for the Lagrangian multipliers significantly
accelerates the convergence of PLAM and makes it comparable with the existent
feasible solvers for optimization problems with orthogonality constraints, and
the performance of PCAL does not highly rely on the choice of the penalty
parameter. Numerical experiments under parallel environment demonstrate that
PCAL attains good performance and high scalability in solving discretized
Kohn-Sham total energy minimization problems.

observational window to reveal the properties of compact binaries in the
Universe. In particular, the discovery of the first binary neutron star
coalescence, GW170817, led to a number of scientific breakthroughs as the
possibility to place constraints on the equation of state of cold matter at
supranuclear densities. These constraints and all scientific results based on
them require accurate models describing the GW signal to extract the source
properties from the measured signal.
  In this article, we study potential systematic biases during the extraction
of source parameters using different descriptions for both, the point-particle
dynamics and tidal effects. We find that for the considered cases the mass and
spin recovery show almost no systematic bias with respect to the chosen
waveform model. However, the extracted tidal effects can be strongly biased,
where we find generally that Post-Newtonian approximants predict neutron stars
with larger deformability and radii than numerical relativity tuned models.
Noteworthy, an increase in the Post-Newtonian order in the tidal phasing does
not lead to a monotonic change in the estimated properties.
  We find that for a signal with strength similar to GW170817, but observed
with design sensitivity, the estimated tidal parameters can differ by more than
a factor of two depending on the employed tidal description of the waveform
approximant. This shows the current need for the development of better waveform
models to extract reliably the source properties from upcoming GW detections.

class of gradient flows in a metric space $(X,\mathsf{d})$ that can be
characterized by Evolution Variational Inequalities. We present new results
concerning the structural properties of solutions to the $\mathrm{EVI}$
formulation, such as contraction, regularity, asymptotic expansion, precise
energy identity, stability, asymptotic behaviour and their link with the
geodesic convexity of the driving functional. Under the crucial assumption of
the existence of an $\mathrm{EVI}$ gradient flow, we will also prove two main
results: the equivalence with the De Giorgi variational characterization of
curves of maximal slope and the convergence of the Minimizing Movement-JKO
scheme to the $\mathrm{EVI}$ gradient flow, with an explicit and uniform error
estimate of order $1/2$ with respect to the step size, independent of any
geometric hypothesis (such as upper or lower curvature bounds) on $\mathsf{d}$.
In order to avoid any compactness assumption, we will also introduce a suitable
relaxation of the Minimizing Movement algorithm obtained by the Ekeland
variational principle, and we will prove its uniform convergence as well.

engine with a specific focus on memory characteristics and energy needs.
ExaHyPE combines dynamically adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) with ADER-DG. It is
parallelized using tasks, and it is cache efficient. AMR plus ADER-DG yields a
task graph which is highly dynamic in nature and comprises both arithmetically
expensive tasks and tasks which challenge the memory's latency. The expensive
tasks and thus the whole code benefit from AVX vectorization, though we suffer
from memory access bursts. A frequency reduction of the chip improves the
code's energy-to-solution. Yet, it does not mitigate burst effects. The bursts'
latency penalty becomes worse once we add Intel Optane technology, increase the
core count significantly, or make individual, computationally heavy tasks fall
out of close caches. Thread overbooking to hide away these latency penalties
contra-productive with non-inclusive caches as it destroys the cache and
vectorization character. In cases where memory-intense and computationally
expensive tasks overlap, ExaHyPE's cache-oblivious implementation can exploit
deep, non-inclusive, heterogeneous memory effectively, as main memory misses
arise infrequently and slow down only few cores. We thus propose that upcoming
supercomputing simulation codes with dynamic, inhomogeneous task graphs are
actively supported by thread runtimes in intermixing tasks of different compute
character, and we propose that future hardware actively allows codes to
downclock the cores running particular task types.

(1) No Language Structure in Context: Probabilistic topic models ignore word
order by summarizing a given context as a ""bag-of-word"" and consequently the
semantics of words in the context is lost. The LSTM-LM learns a vector-space
representation of each word by accounting for word order in local collocation
patterns and models complex characteristics of language (e.g., syntax and
semantics), while the TM simultaneously learns a latent representation from the
entire document and discovers the underlying thematic structure. We unite two
complementary paradigms of learning the meaning of word occurrences by
combining a TM (e.g., DocNADE) and a LM in a unified probabilistic framework,
named as ctx-DocNADE. (2) Limited Context and/or Smaller training corpus of
documents: In settings with a small number of word occurrences (i.e., lack of
context) in short text or data sparsity in a corpus of few documents, the
application of TMs is challenging. We address this challenge by incorporating
external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language
modelling approach: we use word embeddings as input of a LSTM-LM with the aim
to improve the word-topic mapping on a smaller and/or short-text corpus. The
proposed DocNADE extension is named as ctx-DocNADEe.
  We present novel neural autoregressive topic model variants coupled with
neural LMs and embeddings priors that consistently outperform state-of-the-art

cost can be mitigated by using the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
capibility, or vectorization, now available on most architectures. This article
details and discusses the vectorization strategy developed in the code Smilei
which takes advantage from an efficient, systematic, cell-based sorting of the
particles. The PIC operators on particles (projection, push, deposition) have
been optimized to benefit from large SIMD vectors on both recent and older
architectures. The efficiency of these vectorized operations increases with the
number of particles per cell (PPC), typically speeding up three-dimensional
simulations by a factor 2 with 256 PPC. Although this implementation shows
acceleration from as few as 8 PPC, it can be slower than the scalar version in
domains containing fewer PPC as usually observed in vectorization attempts.
This issue is overcome with an adaptive algorithm which switches locally
between scalar (for few PPC) and vectorized operators (otherwise). The newly
implemented methods are benchmarked on three different, large-scale simulations
considering configurations frequently studied with PIC codes.

denoising images. Importantly, these heat kernels give rise to operators that
include (but are not restricted to) the generators of the classical Laplacian
associated to Brownian processes as well as the fractional Laplacian associated
with $\beta$-stable L\'evy processes. For local kernels, while the method is a

graph distance is used to approximate the geodesic distance with appropriate

number of data points increases, it produces an accurate operator estimation
that is robust to the choice of the kernel bandwidth parameter value. In
contrast, the local kernels are numerically more efficient but more sensitive
to the choice of kernel bandwidth parameter value. In an application to
estimate non-smooth regression functions, we find that using the nonlocal
kernel as a regularizer produces a more robust and accurate estimate than using
local kernels. For manifolds with boundary, we find that the proposed
fractional diffusion maps framework implemented with non-local kernels
approximates the regional fractional Laplacian.

sheets largely dominate the distribution of the emerging current structures, in
contrast to the usual picture, where a full hierarchy of structure sizes is
generally observed. These current sheets are shown to be the sites of
electron-only reconnection (e-rec), in which the usual electron exhausts are
unaccompanied by ion outflows and which are in qualitative agreement with those
recently observed by MMS in the Earth's turbulent magnetosheath, downstream of

photonics-based simulation to date, applied in the context of subatomic
physics. Using an all-optical quantum frequency processor, the ground-state
energies of light nuclei including the triton ($^3$H), $^{3}$He, and the alpha
particle ($^{4}$He) are computed. Complementing these calculations and
utilizing a 68-dimensional Hilbert space, our photonic simulator is used to
perform sub-nucleon calculations of the two-body and three-body forces between
heavy mesons in the Schwinger model. This work is a first step in simulating
subatomic many-body physics on quantum frequency processors---augmenting
classical computations that bridge scales from quarks to nuclei.

to nonlinear Hamiltonian systems, accelerator physics, plasma physics, and
quantum physics. It is shown that the solution map of a linear Hamiltonian
system with time-dependent coefficients can be parameterized by an envelope
matrix $w(t)$, which has a clear physical meaning and satisfies a nonlinear
envelope matrix equation. It is proved that a linear Hamiltonian system with
periodic coefficients is stable iff the envelope matrix equation admits a
solution with periodic $\sqrt{w^{\dagger}w}$ and a suitable initial condition.
The mathematical devices utilized in this theoretical development with
significant physical implications are time-dependent canonical transformations,
normal forms for stable symplectic matrices, and horizontal polar decomposition
of symplectic matrices. These tools systematically decompose the dynamics of
linear Hamiltonian systems with time-dependent coefficients, and are expected

in a surfactant-laden fluid can self-propel spontaneously. The onset of this
motion is attributed to a symmetry-breaking Marangoni instability resulting
from the nonlinear advective coupling of the distribution of surfactant to the
hydrodynamic flow generated by Marangoni stresses at the droplet's surface.
Here, we use weakly nonlinear analysis to characterize the self-propulsion near
the instability threshold and the influence of the droplet's deformability. We
report that in vicinity of the threshold, deformability enhances
self-propulsion of viscous droplets, but hinders propulsion of drops that are
roughly less viscous than the surrounding fluid. Our asymptotics further
reveals that droplet deformability may alter the type of bifurcation leading to
symmetry breaking: for moderately deformable droplets the onset of
self-propulsion is transcritical and a regime of steady self-propulsion is
stable; while in the case of highly deformable drops, no steady flows can be
found within the asymptotic limit considered in this paper suggesting that the
bifurcation is subcritical.

informational measure (CIM) that selects critical points and brings out phase
transitions in confined energy models with arbitrary parameters. We select the
DSG scenario because it presents an energy-degenerate spatially localized
profile where the solutions to the scalar field demonstrate critical behavior

evaluation provides a method for predicting the existence of a transition
between the phases of the domain wall solutions. Moreover, the entropic measure
reveals information about the model that is capable of describing the phase
sector where we obtain resonance modes on the massive spectra of the graviton.
The graviton resonance lifetimes are related to the existence of scales on
which 4D gravity is recovered. Thus, we correlate the critical points defined
by the {CIMs} with the existence of resonances and their lifetimes. To extend
our research regarding this system, we calculate the corrections to Newton's
Law coming from the graviton modes.

time consuming 3D evaluation, like, segmentation, is able to provide precise
estimation of a number of valuable spatial characteristics, giving us
understanding about the course of the disease.\newline Recent studies, focusing
on the segmentation task, report superior performance of Deep Learning methods
compared to classical computer vision algorithms. But still, it remains a
challenging problem. In this paper we present deep cascaded approach for
automatic brain tumor segmentation. Similar to recent methods for object
detection, our implementation is based on neural networks; we propose
modifications to the 3D UNet architecture and augmentation strategy to
efficiently handle multimodal MRI input, besides this we introduce approach to

vision and learning applications. In the past few years, both knowledge-driven
maximum a posterior (MAP) with prior modelings and fully data-dependent
convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques have been investigated to address
specific enhancement tasks. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of
these two types of mechanisms within a complementary propagation perspective,
we propose a unified framework, named deep prior ensemble (DPE), for solving
various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, we first establish the basic
propagation scheme based on the fundamental image modeling cues and then
introduce residual CNNs to help predicting the propagation direction at each
stage. By designing prior projections to perform feedback control, we
theoretically prove that even with experience-inspired CNNs, DPE is definitely
converged and the output will always satisfy our fundamental task constraints.
The main advantage against conventional optimization-based MAP approaches is
that our descent directions are learned from collected training data, thus are
much more robust to unwanted local minimums. While, compared with existing CNN
type networks, which are often designed in heuristic manners without
theoretical guarantees, DPE is able to gain advantages from rich task cues
investigated on the bases of domain knowledges. Therefore, DPE actually
provides a generic ensemble methodology to integrate both knowledge and
data-based cues for different image enhancement tasks. More importantly, our
theoretical investigations verify that the feedforward propagations of DPE are
properly controlled toward our desired solution. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed DPE outperforms state-of-the-arts on a variety of
image enhancement tasks in terms of both quantitative measure and visual
perception quality.

are expected to reach this threshold. We identify three distinct cascading
regimes in the interaction of counter-propagating, circularly-polarised laser
pulses with a thin foil by performing a comprehensive scan over the laser
intensity (from $10^{23}$ -- $5\times10^{24}$\ Wcm$^{-2}$) and initial foil
target density (from $10^{26}$ -- $10^{31}$\ m$^{-3}$). For low densities and
intensities the number of pairs grows exponentially. If the intensity and
target density are high enough the number density of created pairs reaches the
relativistically-corrected critical density, the pair plasma efficiently
absorbs the laser energy (through radiation reaction) and the cascade
saturates. If the initial density is too high, such that the initial target is
overdense, the cascade is suppressed by the skin effect. We derive a
semi-analytical model which predicts that dense pair plasmas are endemic
features of these interactions for intensities above $10^{24}$ Wcm$^{-2}$

homogeneous fast streams (i.e. well-defined streams of coronal-hole plasma that
maintain their identity during several solar rotations) by means of
re-processed particle data, from the HELIOS satellites between 0.3 and 1 AU. We
have identified 16 intervals of unperturbed high-speed coronal hole plasma,
from three different sources and measured at different radial distances. The
observations show that, for all three streams, (i) the proton density decreases
as expected for a radially expanding plasma, unlike previous analysis that
found a slower decrease; (ii) the magnetic field deviates from the Parker
prediction, with the radial and tangential components decreasing more slowly
and quickly than expected, respectively; (iii) the double-adiabatic invariants
are violated and an increase of entropy is observed; (iv) the proton-core
temperature anisotropy is constrained by mirror mode instability; (v) the
collisional frequency is not constant, but decreases as the plasma travels away

Furthermore, the quality of GTD is closely related to the performance of a
supervised learning algorithm. To reduce manual work in the labeling process,
we generated weakly annotated GTD by marking only character centroids. Whereas
bounding-boxes for characters require at least a drag-and-drop operation or two
clicks to annotate a character location, the weakly annotated GTD requires a
single click to record a character location. The main contribution of this
paper is on selective distillation to improve the quality of the weakly
annotated GTD. Because manual GTD are usually generated by many people, it may
contain personal bias or human error. To address this problem, the information
in manual GTD is integrated and refined by selective distillation. In the
process of selective distillation, a fully convolutional network is trained
using the weakly annotated GTD, and its prediction maps are selectively used to
revise locations and boundaries of semantic regions of characters in the
initial GTD. The modified GTD are used in the main training stage, and a
post-processing is conducted to retrieve text information. Experiments were
thoroughly conducted on actual industry data collected at a steelmaking factory
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

symmetry of the confining trap affects the macroscopic quantum tunneling
dynamics of the system between the two wells. In an asymmetric DW, the two
wells are not equivalent anymore -the left well is deeper than the right one.
Accordingly, we analyze the dynamics by initially preparing the condensate in
both the left and the right well. We examined the frequencies and amplitudes of
the oscillations of the survival probabilities, the time scale for the
development of fragmentation and its degree, and the growth and oscillatory
behavior of the many-body position and momentum variances. There is an overall
suppression of the oscillations of the survival probabilities in an asymmetric
double well. However, depending on whether the condensate is initially prepared
in the left or right well, the repulsive inter-atomic interactions affect the
survival probabilities differently. The degree of fragmentation depends both on
the asymmetry of the trap and the initial well in which the condensate is
prepared in a non-trivial manner. Overall, the many-body position and momentum
variances bear the prominent signatures of the density oscillations of the
system in the asymmetric double well as well as a breathing-mode oscillation.
Finally, a universality of fragmentation for systems made of different numbers
of particles but the same interaction parameter is also found. The phenomenon
is robust despite the asymmetry of the junction and admits a

sized trees had either negative or no density effects. Tree size was more
important predictor than density in survival and this has implications for
nature based solutions: maintaining large tree individuals or planting species
that can become large-sized can safeguard against tree less areas by promoting
survival at long time periods through harsh environmental conditions. Large
trees had also a significant effect in moderating land surface temperature.

variability caused by exoplanets in stars with $m_V < 8.4$. Such variability
signals are typically small and require an accurate calibration algorithm,
tailored to the survey, in order to be detected. This paper presents the
methods developed to calibrate the raw photometry of the MASCARA and bRing
stations and characterizes the performance of the methods and instruments.
Methods: For the primary calibration a modified version of the coarse
decorrelation algorithm is used, which corrects for the extinction due to the
earth's atmosphere, the camera transmission, and intrapixel variations.
Residual trends are removed from the light curves of individual stars using
empirical secondary calibration methods. In order to optimize these methods, as
well as characterize the performance of the instruments, transit signals were
injected in the data. Results: After optimal calibration an RMS scatter of 10
mmag at $m_V \sim 7.5$ is achieved in the light curves. By injecting transit
signals with periods between one and five days in the MASCARA data obtained by
the La Palma station over the course of one year, we demonstrate that MASCARA
La Palma is able to recover 84.0, 60.5 and 20.7% of signals with depths of 2, 1
and 0.5% respectively, with a strong dependency on the observed declination,
recovering 65.4% of all transit signals at $\delta > 0^\circ$ versus 35.8% at
$\delta < 0^\circ$. Using the full three years of data obtained by MASCARA La
Palma to date, similar recovery rates are extended to periods up to ten days.
We derive a preliminary occurrence rate for hot Jupiters around A-stars of ${>}
0.4 \%$, knowing that many hot Jupiters are still overlooked. In the era of
TESS, MASCARA and bRing will provide an interesting synergy for finding
long-period (${>} 13.5$ days) transiting gas-giant planets around the brightest
stars.

into account the time-varying nature of dynamics of open systems. Secondly, we
show that models with explicit dependence on time exhibit stark dynamic
phenomena, even when they cannot be defined for infinite time. We see a
bifurcation occurring in nonautonomous finite-time systems that cannot be
identified by classical methods for infinite-time autonomous systems. Thirdly,
even when a time-varying model can be extended to infinite time, the classical
infinite-time approach is likely to miss dynamical phenomena that are more
readily understood within the framework of finite-time dynamics. We conclude
the potentially crucial importance of a nonautonomous finite-time approach to

robust true error certifications and discuss three versions of greedy
algorithms to balance the finite element error, the exact reduced basis error,
and the adaptive mesh refinements.
  For a class of convex minimization variational problems which has
corresponding dual problems satisfying the strong duality, the primal-dual gap
between the primal and dual functionals can be used as a posteriori error
estimator. This primal-dual gap error estimator is robust with respect to the
parameters of the problem, and it can be used for both mesh refinements of
finite element methods and the true RB error certification.
  With the help of integrations by parts formula, the primal-dual variational
theory is developed for the symmetric coercive elliptic boundary value problems
with non-homogeneous boundary conditions by both the conjugate function and
Lagrangian theories. A generalized Prager-Synge identity, which is the
primal-dual gap error representation for this specific problem, is developed.
RBMs for both the primal and dual problems with robust error estimates are
developed. The dual variational problem often can be viewed as a constraint
optimization problem. In the paper, different from the standard saddle-point
finite element approximation, the dual RBM is treated as a Galerkin projection
by constructing RB spaces satisfying the homogeneous constraint.
  Inspired by the greedy algorithm with spatio-parameter adaptivity of
\cite{Yano:18}, adaptive balanced greedy algorithms with primal-dual finite
element and reduced basis error estimators are discussed. Numerical tests are
presented to test the PD-RBM with adaptive balanced greedy algorithms.

deformable objects. By mapping the point cloud of the current object to the
pre-trained point cloud, a transformation function can be constructed. The
manipulator's trajectory for pre-trained shapes can be warped with this
transformation function, yielding a feasible trajectory for the new shape.
However, usually this transformation function regards objects as discrete
points, and dismisses the topological structures. Therefore, it risks
over-stretching or over-compression during manipulation. To tackle this
problem, this paper proposes a tangent space point set registration method. A
tangent space representation of an object is constructed by defining an angle
for each node on the object. Point set registration algorithm runs in this
newly-constructed tangent space, yielding a tangent space trajectory. The
trajectory is then converted back to Cartesian space and carried out by the
robot. Compared to its counterpart in Cartesian space, tangent space point set
registration is safer and more robust, succeeding in a series of experiments
such as rope straightening, rope knotting, cloth folding and unfolding.

Non-mechanical stimuli, such as one that tends to modify the rest curvature of

systems, and may occur due to thermal expansion, changes in pH, differential
swelling, and differential growth. Here, we investigate how the presence of
both an evolving natural curvature and an external pressure modifies the
stability of a complete spherical shell. We show that due to a mechanical
analogy between pressure and curvature, positive natural curvatures can
severely destabilize a thin shell, while negative natural curvatures can
strengthen the shell against buckling, providing the possibility to design
shells that buckle at or above the theoretical limit for pressure alone, i.e. a
knock-up factor. These results extend directly from the classical analysis of
the stability of shells under pressure, and highlight the important role that
non-mechanical stimuli can have on modifying the the membrane state of stress

statistical characteristics of a light field. In particular, we are interested
in the question whether an initial state transforms into a lasing state,
i.e.,~a (phase diffused) coherent state, after infinitely many photon
subtractions. This question is discussed in terms of the Glauber
P-representation $P(\alpha)$, the photon number distribution $P[n]$, and the
experimentally relevant autocorrelation functions $g^{(m)}$. We show that a
thermal state does not converge to a lasing state, although all of its
autocorrelation functions at zero delay time converge to one. This
contradiction is resolved by the analysis of the involved limits, and a general
criterion for an initial state to reach at least such a pseudo-lasing state
($g^{(m)}\to 1$) is derived, revealing that they can be generated from a large
class of initial states.

the Small Magellanic Cloud as previously thought. We conduct a reanalysis of
the star's physical and kinematic properties, which indicates that the star may
be an even more extraordinary find than previously reported. The star is a 180
Myr old 3-4 Mo G5-8 bright giant, with an effective temperature of 4800+/-100
K, a metallicity of {Fe/H]=-0.5, and a luminosity of log L/Lo=2.70+/-0.20 dex.
A comparison with evolutionary tracks identifies the star as being in a giant
or early asymptotic giant branch stage. The proper motion, combined with the
previously known radial velocity, yields a total Galactocentric space velocity
of 296 km/s. The star is currently located 6.4 kpc below the plane of the Milky
Way, but our analysis of its orbit shows it passed through the disk ~25 Myr
ago. The star's metallicity and age argue against it being native to the halo,
and we suggest that the star was likely ejected from the disk. We discuss
several ejection mechanisms, and conclude that the most likely scenario is
ejection by the Milky Way's central black hole based upon our analysis of the
star's orbit. The identification of the large radial velocity of
J01020100-7122208 came about as a happenstance of it being seen in projection
with the SMC, and we suggest that many similar objects may be revealed in Gaia

computer vision. While other image-based depth sensing techniques leverage on
the geometry between different viewpoints (e.g., stereo or structure from
motion), the lack of these cues within a single image renders ill-posed the
monocular depth estimation task. For inference, state-of-the-art
encoder-decoder architectures for monocular depth estimation rely on effective
feature representations learned at training time. For unsupervised training of
these models, geometry has been effectively exploited by suitable images
warping losses computed from views acquired by a stereo rig or a moving camera.
In this paper, we make a further step forward showing that learning semantic
information from images enables to improve effectively monocular depth
estimation as well. In particular, by leveraging on semantically labeled images
together with unsupervised signals gained by geometry through an image warping
loss, we propose a deep learning approach aimed at joint semantic segmentation
and depth estimation. Our overall learning framework is semi-supervised, as we
deploy groundtruth data only in the semantic domain. At training time, our
network learns a common feature representation for both tasks and a novel
cross-task loss function is proposed. The experimental findings show how,
jointly tackling depth prediction and semantic segmentation, allows to improve
depth estimation accuracy. In particular, on the KITTI dataset our network
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for monocular depth estimation.

an essential tool for many daily activities. This resulted in an increase in
the amount of information available in users' contexts that is not taken into
account by current information retrieval systems. This thesis proposes a
semisupervised information retrieval technique that helps users to recover
context relevant information. The objective of the proposed technique is to
reduce the vocabulary gap existing between the knowledge a user has about a
specific topic and the relevant documents available in the Web. This thesis
presents a method for learning novel terms associated with a thematic context.
This is achieved by identifying those terms that are good descriptors and good
discriminators of the user's current thematic context. In order to evaluate the
proposed method, a theoretical framework for the evaluation of search
mechanisms was developed. This served as a guide for the implementation of an
evaluation framework that allowed to compare the techniques proposed in this
thesis with other techniques existing in the literature. The experimental
evidence indicates that the methods proposed in this thesis present significant
improvements over previously published techniques. In addition, the evaluation
framework was equipped with novel evaluation metrics that favor the exploration
of novel material and incorporates a semantic relationship metric between
documents. The algorithms developed in this thesis evolve high quality queries,
which have the capability of retrieving results that are relevant to the user
context. These results have a positive impact on the way users interact with
available resources.

the transition from order to period-doubling bifurcation and finally enter
chaos by adjusting the microwave driving power. Different from the normal
chaos, the magnon chaos-order transition proposed here is phase-mediated.

paper, we introduce the use of light to switch and tune the optical response of
a structured material, exploiting a physical deformation induced by light
itself. In this new strategy, light drives an elastic reshaping, which leads to
different spectral properties and hence to a change in the optical response.
This is made possible by the use of liquid crystalline networks structured by
Direct Laser Writing. As a proof of concept, a grating structure with
sub-millisecond time-response is demonstrated for optical beam steering
exploiting an optically induced reversible shape-change. Experimental
observations are combined with finite-element modeling to understand the
actuation process dynamics and to obtain information on how to tune the time
and the power response of this technology. This optical beam steerer serves as
an example for achieving full optical control of light in broad range of
structured optical materials.

knowledge of discontinuous associations amongst linguistic features, and an
ability to recognise such patterns of associations, provides a robust means of
determining what a pronoun like ""they"" refers to. For any AI system to solve
this kind of problem, it needs appropriate knowledge of relevant syntax and
semantics which, ideally, it should learn for itself. Although the SP System
has some strengths in unsupervised learning, its capabilities in this area are
not yet good enough to learn the kind of knowledge needed to interpret WS
examples, so it must be supplied with such knowledge at the outset. However,
its existing strengths in unsupervised learning suggest that it has potential
to learn the kind of knowledge needed for the interpretation of WS examples. In
particular, it has potential to learn the kind of discontinuous association of
linguistic features mentioned earlier.

to equilibrate. We then deduce conditions for non-oscillatory convergence of
the solutions, which could ensure that the blood cell concentration does not
oscillate. Further, we define the convergence characteristics of the solutions
which govern the rate at which the concentration equilibrates when the system
is stable. Owing to the possibility that physiological parameters can seldom be
estimated precisely, we also derive bounds for robust stability\textemdash
which enable one to ensure that the blood cell concentration equilibrates

sufficient condition for local stability is violated, the system transits into
instability via a Hopf bifurcation, leading to limit cycles in the blood cell
concentration. We then outline a framework to characterise the type of the Hopf
bifurcation and determine the asymptotic orbital stability of limit cycles. The
analysis is complemented with numerical examples, stability charts and

non-Markovianity is a necessary ingredient to capture the non-trivial temporal
patterns of real-world networks. However, our understanding of how memory can
affect the properties of dynamical processes taking place over temporal
networks is still very limited, being especially constrained to the case of
short-term memory. Here, by introducing a model for temporal networks in which
we can precisely control the link density and the strength and length of memory
for each link, we unveil the role played by memory on the dynamics of epidemic
spreading processes. Surprisingly, we find that the average spreading time in
our temporal networks is often non-monotonically dependent on the length of the
memory, and that the optimal value of the memory length which maximizes the
spreading time depends on the strength of the memory and on the density of
links in the network. Through analytical arguments we then explore the effect
that changing the number and length of network paths connecting any two nodes

In order that the interaction tensor be Lorentz-invariant in special
relativity, it has to depend only on a scalar field $p$. Since the system of
electrodynamics of the theory is closed in the absence of the interaction
tensor, just one scalar equation more is needed to close it again in the
presence of $p$. We add the equation for charge conservation. We derive
equations that will allow one to determine the field $p$ in a given weak

recognition (NER), which needs a number of labeled data to for model training.
When meeting a new domain (target domain) for NER, there is no or a few labeled
data, which makes domain NER much more difficult. As NER has been researched
for a long time, some similar domain already has well labelled data (source
domain). Therefore, in this paper, we focus on domain NER by studying how to
utilize the labelled data from such similar source domain for the new target
domain. We design a kernel function based instance transfer strategy by getting
similar labelled sentences from a source domain. Moreover, we propose an
enhanced recurrent neural network (ERNN) by adding an additional layer that
combines the source domain labelled data into traditional RNN structure.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two datasets. The comparison results
among HMM, CRF and RNN show that RNN performs bette than others. When there is
no labelled data in domain target, compared to directly using the source domain
labelled data without selecting transferred instances, our enhanced RNN
approach gets improvement from 0.8052 to 0.9328 in terms of F1 measure.

which may contribute to designing magazine covers, tourism publicity materials,
and so forth. Recent works have shed light on the visual features that make
generic images, object images or face photographs memorable. However, these
methods are not able to effectively predict the memorability of outdoor natural
scene images. To overcome this shortcoming of previous works, in this paper, we
provide an attempt to answer: ""what exactly makes outdoor natural scenes
memorable"". To this end, we first establish a large-scale outdoor natural scene
image memorability (LNSIM) database, containing 2,632 outdoor natural scene
images with their ground truth memorability scores and the multi-label scene
category annotations. Then, similar to previous works, we mine our database to
investigate how low-, middle- and high-level handcrafted features affect the
memorability of outdoor natural scenes. In particular, we find that the
high-level feature of scene category is rather correlated with outdoor natural
scene memorability, and the deep features learnt by deep neural network (DNN)
are also effective in predicting the memorability scores. Moreover, combining
the deep features with the category feature can further boost the performance
of memorability prediction. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end DNN based
outdoor natural scene memorability (DeepNSM) predictor, which takes advantage
of the learned category-related features. Then, the experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our DeepNSM model, exceeding the state-of-the-art
methods. Finally, we try to understand the reason of the good performance for
our DeepNSM model, and also study the cases that our DeepNSM model succeeds or

by-product, a new proof of an earlier result of G. Gr\""atzer is obtained.
Moreover, our results yield a new characterization of discrete Sugeno integrals
on bounded distributive lattices.

  https://github.com/hpaulkeeler/DetPoisson_MATLAB","Proc. of IEEE WCNC 2019",,,"cs.LG math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new type of dependent thinning for point processes in continuous space is
proposed, which leverages the advantages of determinantal point processes
defined on finite spaces and, as such, is particularly amenable to statistical,
numerical, and simulation techniques. It gives a new point process that can
serve as a network model exhibiting repulsion. The properties and functions of
the new point process, such as moment measures, the Laplace functional, the
void probabilities, as well as conditional (Palm) characteristics can be
estimated accurately by simulating the underlying (non-thinned) point process,
which can be taken, for example, to be Poisson. This is in contrast (and
preference to) finite Gibbs point processes, which, instead of thinning,
require weighting the Poisson realizations, involving usually intractable
normalizing constants. Models based on determinantal point processes are also
well suited for statistical (supervised) learning techniques, allowing the
models to be fitted to observed network patterns with some particular geometric
properties. We illustrate this approach by imitating with determinantal
thinning the well-known Mat{\'e}rn~II hard-core thinning, as well as a
soft-core thinning depending on nearest-neighbour triangles. These two examples
demonstrate how the proposed approach can lead to new, statistically optimized,
probabilistic transmission scheduling schemes.

  Excited by Stable L\'evy Noise",,,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the most probable trajectories of the concentration evolution for
the transcription factor activator in a genetic regulation system, with
non-Gaussian stable L\'evy noise in the synthesis reaction rate taking into
account. We calculate the most probable trajectory by spatially maximizing the
probability density of the system path, i.e., the solution of the associated
nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We especially examine those most probable
trajectories from low concentration state to high concentration state (i.e.,
the likely transcription regime) for certain parameters, in order to gain
insights into the transcription processes and the tipping time for the
transcription likely to occur. This enables us: (i) to visualize the progress
of concentration evolution (i.e., observe whether the system enters the
transcription regime within a given time period); (ii) to predict or avoid
certain transcriptions via selecting specific noise parameters in particular
regions in the parameter space. Moreover, we have found some peculiar or
counter-intuitive phenomena in this gene model system, including (a) a smaller
noise intensity may trigger the transcription process, while a larger noise
intensity can not, under the same asymmetric L\'evy noise. This phenomenon does
not occur in the case of symmetric L\'evy noise; (b) the symmetric L\'evy
motion always induces transition to high concentration, but certain asymmetric
L\'evy motions do not trigger the switch to transcription. These findings
provide insights for further experimental research, in order to achieve or to
avoid specific gene transcriptions, with possible relevance for medical
advances.

so far by conventional high-frequency methods, so that those data might, from
