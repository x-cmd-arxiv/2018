regularities of the appearance of a chaotic set under the saddle-node scenario
of the birth of the Smale--Williams hyperbolic attractor. In such a mapping, a
non-trivial chaotic set (with non-zero Hausdorff dimension) arises in the
general case as a result of a cascade of period-adding bifurcations
characterized by geometric scaling both in the phase space and in the parameter
space. Numerical analysis of the behavior of models demonstrating the
saddle-node scenario of birth of a hyperbolic chaotic Smale--Williams attractor
shows that these regularities are preserved in the case of multidimensional
systems. Limits of applicability of the approximate 1D model are discussed.

In previous work, we investigated the expressive and computational power of
dialectical systems, and we compared them to a new class of systems, that of
quasidialectical systems, that enrich Magari's systems with a natural mechanism
of revision. In the present paper we consider a third class of systems, that of
$p$-dialectical systems, that naturally combine features coming from the two
other cases. We prove several results about $p$-dialectical systems and the
sets that they represent. Then we focus on the completions of first-order
theories. In doing so, we consider systems with connectives, i.e. systems that
encode the rules of classical logic. We show that any consistent system with
connectives represents the completion of a given theory. We prove that
dialectical and $q$-dialectical systems coincide with respect to the
completions that they can represent. Yet, $p$-dialectical systems are more
powerful: we exhibit a $p$-dialectical system representing a completion of
Peano Arithmetic which is neither dialectical nor $q$-dialectical.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are characterized by overabundances of
s-process elements. Roughly half of them are enhanced in technetium (Tc), an
s-process element with no stable isotope, while the other half lack technetium.
This dichotomy arises from the fact that Tc-rich S stars are intrinsically
producing s-process elements and have undergone third dredge-up (TDU) events,
while Tc-poor S stars owe their s-process overabundances to a past pollution by
a former AGB companion. Our aim is to analyse the abundances of S stars and
gain insights into their evolutionary status and on the nucleosynthesis of
heavy s-process elements taking place in their interior. In particular, the
location of extrinsic and intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram will be compared
with the theoretical onset of the TDU on the thermally-pulsing AGB. A sample of
19 S-type stars was analysed by combining HERMES high-resolution spectra,
accurate Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models, and
newly-designed MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Combining the derived
parameters with GDR2 parallaxes allows a joint analysis of the location of the
stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and of their surface abundances. For
all 19 stars, Zr and Nb abundances are derived, complemented by abundances of
other s-process elements for the three Tc-rich S stars. These abundances agree
within the uncertainties with nucleosynthesis predictions for stars of
corresponding mass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. Most extrinsic S stars
lie close to the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), and a few are located along
the early AGB. The location of intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram is
compatible with them being thermally-pulsing AGB stars.

process, $gq\to\gamma q$ contributes significantly to the production of
direct-photons at midrapidity and dominates it in the negative (backward)
rapdity region. We find that for direct photons, asymmetries of upto 10\% are
allowed by a maximal gluon Sivers function. However, the asymmetry obtained
using existing fits of the GSF available is literature is negligible. We also
estimate the impact that photons produced via fragmentation can have on the
signal and find that their inclusion can dilute the asymmetry by between
10-50\% of the direct-photon value. Finally, using the Colour-Gauge Invariant
generalised parton model (CGI-GPM) approach, we consider the effects of initial
state and final state interactions which can affect the universality of the
Sivers functions in different processes. We find that the inclusion of these
effects leads to the size of the gluon contributions being roughly halved.
However, in the backward region which we are interested in, the sizes of the

be used by unlicensed devices as secondary users. Thanks to their lower
frequencies (e.g., 54 -- 698 MHz in the US), communication over the TV spectrum
has excellent propagation characteristics over long distances and through
obstacles. These characteristics along with their wide availability make the TV
white spaces a great choice and alternative to many existing wireless
technologies, especially the ones that need long range and high bandwidth
communication. In the last decade, there have been numerous efforts from
academia, industries, and standards bodies for exploiting the potentials of the
TV white spaces for several applications including wireless broadband Internet
access. Their characteristics and features also hold potentials for many new
applications including sensing and monitoring, Internet of Things, wireless
control, smart utility, location-based services, and transportation and
logistics. In this paper, we perform a retrospective review and comparative
study of existing work on networking in the TV white spaces. Additionally, we
discuss the associated research challenges such as dealing with the
interference between primary and secondary TV spectrum users, TV white space
temporal and spatial variations and fragmentation, antenna design, mobility,
and security. We also describe the future research directions to handle the
above challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
survey on the literature of TV white space networking research.

the task of mapping 3rd person video features to robot trajectories.

consists of a quasi-two-dimensional sheet of short ($\approx$ 1 $\mu$m) actin
filaments driven by myosin-II motors. By adopting a concerted theoretical and
experimental strategy, new insights are gained into the non-equilibrium
properties of active nematics over a wide range of internal activity levels. In
particular, it is shown that topological defect interactions can be led to
transition from attractive to repulsive as a function of initial defect
separation and relative orientation. Furthermore, by examining the +1/2 defect
morphology as a function of activity, it is found that the apparent elastic
properties of the system (the ratio of bend-to-splay elastic moduli) are
altered considerably by increased activity, leading to an effectively lower
bend elasticity. At high levels of activity, the topological defects that
decorate the material exhibit a liquid-like structure, and adopt preferred
orientations depending on their topological charge. Taken together, these
results suggest that it should be possible to tune internal stresses in active

popular measures of concordance, such as Spearman's rho and Blomqvist's beta,
appear as classical correlations of transformed random variables. We
characterize a whole class of such concordance measures arising from
correlations of transformed random variables, which includes Spearman's rho,

Compatibility and attainability of square matrices with entries given by such

Spearman's rho matrices are in general not attainable for dimensions larger

In this paper we discuss gravitational echoes from ultracompact stars. We
restrict our analysis to exact solutions of Einstein field equations in GR that
are supported by physically motivated equations of state (EoS), and in
particular we impose the constraint of causality. Our main conclusion is that
ultracompact objects supported by physical EoS are not able to generate
gravitational echoes like those that characterize the relaxation phase of a
putative black hole mimicker. Nevertheless, we identify a class of physical
exotic objects that are compact enough to accommodate the presence of an
external unstable light ring, thus opening the possibility of trapping
gravitational radiation and affecting the ringdown phase of a merger event.
Most importantly, we show that once rotation is included these stars --
contrary to what usually expected for ultracompact objects -- are not plagued
by any ergoregion instability. We extend our analysis for arbitrary values of
angular velocity up to the Keplerian limit, and we comment about potential
signals relevant for gravitational wave interferometers.

demonstrated by a feasible design. The high absorption regime (absorption above
90%) for the suggested structure ranges from visible to mid-infrared (MIR),
i.e. for the wavelength from 478 to 3,278 nm that yields an ultra-wide
bandwidth of 2,800 nm. The structure consists of a top-layer-patterned
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) configuration, into the insulator layer of which,
an ultra-thin 5 nm layer of Manganese (Mn) is embedded. The MIM configuration
represents a Ti-Al2O3-Ti tri-layer. It is shown that, without the ultra-thin
layer of Mn, the absorption bandwidth is reduced to 274 nm. Therefore, adding
only a 5 nm layer of Mn leads to a more than tenfold increase in the width of
the absorption band. It is explained in detail that the physical mechanism
contributing to this ultra-broadband result is a combination of plasmonic and
non-plasmonic resonance modes, along with the appropriate optical properties of
Mn. This structure has the relative bandwidth (RBW) of 149%, while only one
step of lithography is required for its fabrication, so it is relatively simple
to fabricate. This makes it rather promising for practical applications.

This deformation breaks ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetry down to ${\mathcal N}=1$

Non-Abelian strings in addition to translational zero modes have orientation
moduli. In the ${\mathcal N}=2$ limit of small $\mu$ the dynamics of
orientational moduli is described by the two dimensional $CP(N-1)$ model for
QCD with $N_f=N$ flavors of quark hypermultiplets. For the case of $N_f>N$ the
non-Abelian string becomes semilocal developing additional size moduli which
modify the effective two dimensional $\sigma$-model on the string making its
target space non-compact. In this paper we consider the $\mu$-deformed theory
with $N_f>N$ eventually making $\mu$ large. We show that size moduli develop a
potential that forces the string transverse size to shrink. Eventually in the
large $\mu$ limit size moduli decouple and the effective theory on the string
reduces to the $CP(N-1)$ model. We also comment on physics of confined
monopoles.

Semantic Hashing is an attempt to overcome such a challenge and learn robust

vocabularies. One of the major drawbacks of such methods is out-of-vocabulary
terms, especially when having small training datasets and using a wider
vocabulary. This is the case in Intent Classification for chatbots, where
typically small datasets are extracted from internet communication. Two
problems arise by the use of internet communication. First, such datasets miss
a lot of terms in the vocabulary to use word embeddings efficiently. Second,
users frequently make spelling errors. Typically, the models for intent
classification are not trained with spelling errors and it is difficult to
think about ways in which users will make mistakes. Models depending on a word
vocabulary will always face such issues. An ideal classifier should handle
spelling errors inherently. With Semantic Hashing, we overcome these challenges

relative intensity BR (branching ratio), it is necessary to measure the spectra

of triple coincidences of electron, proton and radiative gamma-quantum.
Analysis of double coincidences spectra requires one to distinguish events of
ordinary neutron beta decay from the background; analysis of triple
coincidences relies on distinguishing radiative neutron decay from background
events. As demonstrated in our first experiment, these spectra presented a
heterogeneous background that included response peaks related to the
registration of electrons and protons by our electronic detection system. The
NIST experimental group (emiT group) observed an analogous pattern on the
spectrum of double coincidences. The current report is dedicated to the
analysis of this heterogeneous background. In particular, this report
demonstrates that the use of response function methodology allows to clearly

measured by Voyager in the heliosheath and the interpretation of this new data
in terms of the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient at low
rigidities presented in this paper represents a major step in understanding
diffusion theory as it applies to energetic particles. This description uses
electron spectra measured at 5 different epochs and distances within the
heliosheath. The diffusion dependence needed to explain the remarkable solar
modulation effects observed for both electrons and higher rigidity protons as
one progresses from the heliopause inward by ~25 AU to the termination shock
really has two distinct rigidity regimes. Above a rigidity ~Pc the diffusion
coefficient has a dependence ~beta P, the modulation is ~P and its magnitude
increases linearly with radius in AU according to the integral of dr/K. This
integral defines a potential, beta, called the modulation potential, thus
explaining the proton variations. At rigidities <Pc, the diffusion coefficient
is ~beta and independent of rigidity. The modulation is also independent of
rigidity but its magnitude depends on the modulation potential, thus explaining
the electron modulation. One needs both electron and proton observations,
together, to recognize the physical description of the solar modulation
process. For the first time we have been able, using proton data at high
rigidities and electron data at low rigidities, to put together a picture of
the high and low rigidity diffusion coefficients and how they affect energetic

planetesimals in the gaseous envelope of the planet, leading to substantial
enrichment of the envelope mass in heavy elements and a non-uniform composition
with depth. For Kepler-36 c, models involving in situ formation and models
involving orbital migration are considered. The results are compared with
standard formation models. The calculations include the formation (accretion)
phase, as well as the subsequent cooling phase, up to the age of Kepler-36 (7
Gyr). During the latter phase, mass loss induced by stellar XUV radiation is
included. In all cases, the results fit the measured mass, 7.84 M$_\oplus$, and
radius, 3.68 R$_\oplus$, of Kepler-36 c. Two parameters are varied to obtain
these fits: the disk solid surface density at the formation location, and the
""efficiency"" factor in the XUV mass loss rate. The updated models are hotter
and therefore less dense in the silicate portion of the planet and in the
overlying layers of H/He, as compared with standard models. The lower densities
mean that only about half as much H/He is needed to be accreted to fit the
present-day mass and radius constraints. For Kepler-36 b, an updated in situ
calculation shows that the entire H/He envelope is lost, early in the cooling
phase, in agreement with observation.

However, the relationship between the coupling constant and the efficiency of
the engine is rather involved. We find that in the higher spin scenario
efficiency can sometimes be negative (this means work has to be done to run the
engine cycle) for certain range of coupling constants, in contrast to the
aforesaid work of Yi, Talkner and Kim, where they showed that the extracted
work is always positive in the absence of coupling. We provide arguments for
this negative efficiency in higher spin scenarios. Interestingly, this happens
only in the asymmetric scenarios, where the two spins are different. Given
these facts, for judiciously chosen conditions, an engine with coupled working

lightcurves based on Monte-Carlo (MC) techniques for the radiative transfer.
The code assumes spherical symmetry, homologous expansion and steady state for
the matter, but is otherwise capable of solving the time-dependent radiative
transfer problem in non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE). The method used
was introduced in a series of papers by Lucy, but the full time-dependent NLTE
capabilities of it have never been tested. Here, we have extended the method to
include non-thermal excitation and ionization as well as charge-transfer and
two-photon processes. Based on earlier work, the non-thermal rates are
calculated by solving the Spencer-Fano equation. Using a method previously
developed for the SUMO code, macroscopic mixing of the material is taken into
account in a statistical sense. In addition, a statistical Markov-chain model
is used to sample the emission frequency, and we introduce a method to control
the sampling of the radiation field. Except for a description of JEKYLL, we
provide comparisons with the ARTIS, SUMO and CMFGEN codes, which show good
agreement in the calculated spectra as well as the state of the gas. In
particular, the comparison with CMFGEN, which is similar in terms of physics
but uses a different technique, shows that the Lucy method does indeed converge
in the time-dependent NLTE case. Finally, as an example of the time-dependent
NLTE capabilities of JEKYLL, we present a model of a Type IIb SN, taken from a
set of models presented and discussed in detail in an accompanying paper. Based
on this model we investigate the effects of NLTE, in particular those arising
from non-thermal excitation and ionization, and find strong effects even on the
bolometric lightcurve. This highlights the need for full NLTE calculations when
simulating the spectra and lightcurves of SNe.

decreasing the velocity below the optimal value leads to larger outbreaks.
Second, in the cooperative case, the system displays a continuous transition
for low velocities, which becomes discontinuous for velocities of the order of
three times the optimal velocity. Finally, we describe these characteristic

scalar field that represents the extra d.o.f. in $f(T)$ gravity encodes

essential to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this
paper, a deep complex-valued convolutional network (DCCN) is developed to
recover bits from time-domain OFDM signals without relying on any explicit
DFT/IDFT. The DCCN can exploit the cyclic prefix (CP) of OFDM waveform for
increased SNR by replacing DFT with a learned linear transform, and has the
advantage of combining CP-exploitation, channel estimation, and intersymbol
interference (ISI) mitigation, with a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$.
Numerical tests show that the DCCN receiver can outperform the legacy channel
estimators based on ideal and approximate linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE) estimation and a conventional CP-enhanced technique in Rayleigh fading
channels with various delay spreads and mobility. The proposed approach
benefits from the expressive nature of complex-valued neural networks, which,
however, currently lack support from popular deep learning platforms. In
response, guidelines of exact and approximate implementations of a
complex-valued convolutional layer are provided for the design and analysis of
convolutional networks for wireless PHY. Furthermore, a suite of novel training
techniques are developed to improve the convergence and generalizability of the
trained model in fading channels. This work demonstrates the capability of deep

exhibiting SU($N$) symmetry. Motivated in particular by recent experiments
preparing high density samples of strongly interacting ${}^{87}$Sr atoms in a
three-dimensional optical lattice, we develop a low-energy effective theory of
fermionic AEAs which exhibits emergent multi-body SU($N$)-symmetric
interactions, where $N$ is the number of atomic nuclear spin levels. Our theory
is limited to the experimental regime of (i) a deep lattice, with (ii) at most
one atom occupying each nuclear spin state on any lattice site. The latter
restriction is a consequence of initial ground-state preparation. We fully
characterize the low-lying excitations in our effective theory, and compare
predictions of many-body interaction energies with direct measurements of
many-body excitation spectra in an optical lattice clock. Our work makes the
first step in enabling a controlled, bottom-up experimental investigation of
multi-body SU($N$) physics.

a measure of the stellar kinematics. The time when galaxies moved onto the red
sequence depends on their morphology. Disc-type galaxies tend to have become
red during the last 3 Gyr, while elliptical-type galaxies joined the red
sequence earlier, with half the sample already being red 5 Gyr ago. The
time-scale, $\tau_{\rm{Green}}$, of colour transition through the `green

galaxies cross the green valley slightly faster ($\tau_{\rm{Green}}{\approx}1$
Gyr) than disc-type galaxies ($\tau_{\rm{Green}}{\approx}$1.5 Gyr). While
$\tau_{\rm{Green}}$ is similar for central and satellite galaxies, for
satellites $\tau_{\rm{Green}}$ decreases with increasing stellar mass to
host-halo mass ratio. Coupled with our finding that galaxies tend to become
green after becoming satellites, this indicates that satellite-specific
processes are important for quenching red-sequence galaxies. The last time
central, elliptical-type red-sequence galaxies left the blue cloud is strongly
correlated with the time the luminosity of the central black hole peaked, but
this is not the case for discs. This suggests that AGN feedback is important

is coupled to embedded Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers through crystal
deformation. Even though this type of coupling has been investigated
intensively in the past, several inconsistencies exist in available literature,
and no complete and consistent theoretical description has been given thus far.
To clarify and resolve these issues, we here develop a complete and consistent

crystal deformation in terms of stress, defined in the crystal coordinate
system XYZ, and strain, defined in the four individual NV reference frames. We
find that the stress-based approach is straightforward, yields compact
expressions for stress-induced level shifts and therefore constitutes the
preferred approach to be used in future advances in the field. In contrast, the
strain-based formalism is much more complicated and requires extra care when
transforming into the employed NV reference frames. Furthermore, we illustrate
how the developed formalism can be employed to extract values for the
spin-stress and spin-strain coupling constants from data published by Teissier

find successively smaller regions which eventually form a kink. Whenever a kink

distribution of planetesimals develops a bump at intermediate mass after the
oligarchs form. This feature marks a boundary between growth modes. The
smallest planetesimals are packed tightly enough together to populate mean
motion resonances with the oligarchs, which heats the small bodies, enhancing
their growth. If we depopulate most of the resonances by decreasing the width
of the annulus, this effect becomes weaker. To clearly demonstrate the dynamics
driving these growth modes, we also examine the evolution of a planetary embryo
embedded in an annulus of collisionless planetesimals. In this case, we find
that the resonances push planetesimals away from the embryo, decreasing the
surface density of the bodies adjacent to the embryo. This effect only occurs
when the annulus is wide enough and the mass resolution of the planetesimals is
fine enough to populate the resonances. The bump we observe in the mass
distribution resembles the 100 km power law break seen in the size distribution
of asteroid belt objects. Although the bump produced in our simulations occurs
at a size larger than 100 km, we show that the bump location is sensitive to
the initial planetesimal mass, which implies that this feature is potentially
useful for constraining planetesimal formation models.

utilizing stellar continuum spectroscopy, specifically through a combination of

average star-formation timescale of $\tau\sim0.1-0.2$~Gyr. These findings
contrast with measurements from the low-redshift Universe where, on average,
galaxies form their stars over a more extended time period ($\tau>1$~Gyr).

usually referred to as the ""surface term"" can result in erroneous
interpretation of the oscillation frequencies unless treated properly. Several
techniques have been developed to minimize the effect of the surface term; it
is either subtracted out, or frequency combinations insensitive to the surface
terms are used, or the asteroseismic phase $\epsilon$ is used to determine a
match between models and stars. In this paper we show that no matter what
technique is used to account for the surface term, as long as the physics of
the models is the same, the global parameters of a star --- mass, radius and,
age --- obtained from frequency analyses are robust. This implies that even

the transverse mode via the coupling $\phi F \tilde F$ between the inflaton and
the vector field strength. Such a coupling leads to a tachyonic instability and
exponential production of one transverse polarization of the vector field,
reaching its maximum near the end of inflation. At production the mass is
negligible and the vectors add up coherently to form a dark electromagnetic
field. As the Universe expands, the energy density of the dark electromagnetic
field then redshifts like radiation until its wavelength stretches to beyond
its Compton wavelength. After this point the vectors become non-relativistic
and their energy density redshifts like matter. We show that these polarized
transverse vectors can account for the observed dark matter relic density in
the mass range $\mu$eV to hundreds of GeV. We also find that the tachyonic
production mechanism of the transverse mode can accommodate larger vector
masses and lower Hubble scales of inflation compared to the production

learning, it can be computationally challenging or even infeasible to evaluate
an entire function or its derivatives. This motivates the use of stochastic
algorithms that sample problem data, which can jeopardize the guarantees
obtained through classical globalization techniques in optimization such as a
trust region or a line search. Using subsampled function values is particularly
challenging for the latter strategy, which relies upon multiple evaluations. On
top of that all, there has been an increasing interest for nonconvex
formulations of data-related problems, such as training deep learning models.
For such instances, one aims at developing methods that converge to
second-order stationary points quickly, i.e., escape saddle points efficiently.
This is particularly delicate to ensure when one only accesses subsampled
approximations of the objective and its derivatives.
  In this paper, we describe a stochastic algorithm based on negative curvature
and Newton-type directions that are computed for a subsampling model of the
objective. A line-search technique is used to enforce suitable decrease for
this model, and for a sufficiently large sample, a similar amount of reduction
holds for the true objective. By using probabilistic reasoning, we can then
obtain worst-case complexity guarantees for our framework, leading us to
discuss appropriate notions of stationarity in a subsampling context. Our
analysis encompasses the deterministic regime, and allows us to identify
sampling requirements for second-order line-search paradigms. As we illustrate
through real data experiments, these worst-case estimates need not be satisfied
for our method to be competitive with first-order strategies in practice.

how, and when to interact with others in their group. However, it has been
difficult for researchers to detect the inputs to these decisions and, in
particular, how much information individuals actually have about their social
context. We present a new method that can serve as a social assay to quantify
how patterns of aggression depend upon information about the ranks of
individuals within social dominance hierarchies. Applied to existing data on
aggression in 172 social groups across 85 species in 23 orders, it reveals
three main patterns of rank-dependent social dominance: the downward heuristic
(aggress uniformly against lower-ranked opponents), close competitors (aggress
against opponents ranked slightly below self), and bullying (aggress against
opponents ranked much lower than self). The majority of the groups (133 groups,
77%) follow a downward heuristic, but a significant minority (38 groups, 22%)
show more complex social dominance patterns (close competitors or bullying)
consistent with higher levels of social information use. These patterns are not
phylogenetically constrained and different groups within the same species can
use different patterns, suggesting that heuristics use may depend on context
and the structuring of aggression by social information should not be
considered a fixed characteristic of a species. Our approach provides new
opportunities to study the use of social information within and across species

which can control latent attributes in the generated speech that are rarely
annotated in the training data, such as speaking style, accent, background
noise, and recording conditions. The model is formulated as a conditional
generative model based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, with two
levels of hierarchical latent variables. The first level is a categorical
variable, which represents attribute groups (e.g. clean/noisy) and provides
interpretability. The second level, conditioned on the first, is a multivariate
Gaussian variable, which characterizes specific attribute configurations (e.g.
noise level, speaking rate) and enables disentangled fine-grained control over
these attributes. This amounts to using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the
latent distribution. Extensive evaluation demonstrates its ability to control
the aforementioned attributes. In particular, we train a high-quality
controllable TTS model on real found data, which is capable of inferring
speaker and style attributes from a noisy utterance and use it to synthesize
clean speech with controllable speaking style.

pre-defined classes. However, in many applications, it is often desirable to
have the flexibility of learning additional concepts, with limited data and
without re-training on the full training set. This paper addresses this
problem, incremental few-shot learning, where a regular classification network
has already been trained to recognize a set of base classes, and several extra
novel classes are being considered, each with only a few labeled examples.
After learning the novel classes, the model is then evaluated on the overall
classification performance on both base and novel classes. To this end, we
propose a meta-learning model, the Attention Attractor Network, which
regularizes the learning of novel classes. In each episode, we train a set of
new weights to recognize novel classes until they converge, and we show that
the technique of recurrent back-propagation can back-propagate through the
optimization process and facilitate the learning of these parameters. We
demonstrate that the learned attractor network can help recognize novel classes
while remembering old classes without the need to review the original training
set, outperforming various baselines.

importance to economic theory \cite{MCKELVEY1997411}, it is not known whether
it can be computed in polynomial time. The desire to answer efficiently certain

  Our second direction of study is structural. We introduce the anagraph, which
generalizes derangement graphs. For $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge

result fully determines the $n$-tuples $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ for which the
anagraph is connected and leads to a linear algorithm for this task. We end
with a conjecture, which fits into the ongoing debate about the connection
between hamiltonicity and vertex-transitivity \cite{transitive}.

agents (subsystems). Agents in a com- posite system interact with each other
towards performing an in- tended goal. Controllability is essential to achieve
desired system performance in linear time-invariant composite systems. Agents
in a composite system are often uncontrollable individually, further, only a
few agents receive input. In such a case, the agents share/communicate their
private state information with pre-specified neighboring agents so as to
achieve controllability. Our objective in this paper is to identify an optimal
network topology, optimal in the sense of minimum cardinality information
transfer between agents to guarantee the controllability of the composite
system when the possible neighbor set of each agent is pre-specified. We focus
on graph-theoretic analysis referred to as structural controllability as
numerical entries of system matrices in complex systems are mostly unknown. We
first prove that given a set of agents and the possible set of neighbors,
finding a minimum cardinality set of information (interconnections) that must
be shared to accomplish structural controllability of the composite system is
NP-hard. Subsequently, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a
2-optimal solution to this NP-hard problem. Our algorithm combines a minimum
weight bipartite matching algorithm and a minimum spanning tree algorithm and
gives a subset of interconnections which when established guarantees structural
controllability, such that the worst-case performance is 2-optimal. Finally, we
show that our approach directly extends to weighted constrained optimal net-

important component for many robotics applications, such as autonomous
navigation and tracking. With accurate motion prediction of other agents,
robots can plan for more intelligent behaviors to achieve specified objectives,
instead of acting in a purely reactive way. Previous work addresses motion
prediction by either only filtering kinematics, or using hand-designed and
learned representations of the environment. Instead of separating kinematic and
environmental context, we propose a novel approach to integrate both into an
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for trajectory prediction.
Instead of exponentially increasing the state-space complexity with kinematics,
we propose a two-stage neural network architecture that considers motion and
environment together to recover the reward function. The first-stage network
learns feature representations of the environment using low-level LiDAR
statistics and the second-stage network combines those learned features with
kinematics data. We collected over 30 km of off-road driving data and validated
experimentally that our method can effectively extract useful environmental and
kinematic features. We generate accurate predictions of the distribution of
future trajectories of the vehicle, encoding complex behaviors such as
multi-modal distributions at road intersections, and even show different
predictions at the same intersection depending on the vehicle's speed.

the interstellar medium, if we can infer their properties from the
scintillation pattern. With Very Long Baseline Interferometry and working in
delay-delay rate space, where the contributions of pairs of images to the
interference pattern become localized, the scattering geometry and distribution
of scattered images on the sky can be determined if a single,
highly-anisotropic scattering screen is responsible for the scintillation.
However, many pulsars are subject to much more complex scattering environments
where this method cannot be used. We present a novel technique to reconstruct
the scattered flux of the pulsar and solve for the scattering geometry in these
cases by combining interferometric visibilities with cross-correlations of
single-station intensities. This takes advantage of the fact that, considering
a single image pair in delay-delay rate space, the visibilities are sensitive
to the sum of the image angular displacements, while the cross-correlated
intensities are sensitive to the difference, so that their combination can be
used to localize both images of the pair. We show that this technique is able
to reconstruct the published scattering geometry of PSR B0834+06, then apply it
to simulations of more complicated scattering systems, where we find that it
can distinguish features from different scattering screens even when the
presence of multiple screens is not obvious in the Fourier transform of the
dynamic spectrum. This technique will allow us to both better understand the
distribution of scattering within the interstellar medium and to apply current
scintillometry techniques, such as modelling scintillation and constraining the
location of pulsar emission, to sources for which a current lack of
understanding of the scattering environment precludes the use of these
techniques. (abridged)

quantum-nondemolition (QND) measurement schemes. They separate input from
output, impose unidirectional routing of readout signals, and protect the
quantum systems from unwanted noise originated by the output chain. However,
state-of-the-art, cryogenic circulators and isolators are disadvantageous in
scalable superconducting quantum processors because they use magnetic materials
and strong magnetic fields. Here, we realize an active isolator formed by
coupling two nondegenerate Josephson mixers in an interferometric scheme.
Nonreciprocity is generated by applying a phase gradient between the
same-frequency pumps feeding the Josephson mixers, which play the role of the
magnetic field in a Faraday medium. To demonstrate the applicability of this
Josephson-based isolator for quantum measurements, we incorporate it into the
output line of a superconducting qubit, coupled to a fast resonator and a
Purcell filter. We also utilize a wideband, superconducting directional coupler
for coupling the readout signals into and out of the qubit-resonator system and
a quantum-limited Josephson amplifier for boosting the readout fidelity. By
using this novel quantum setup, we demonstrate fast, high-fidelity, QND
measurements of the qubit while providing more than 20 dB of protection against
amplified noise reflected off the Josephson amplifier.

other advantages - the presence of multiple interferometer baselines in an
array provide an important level of redundancy and additional confidence
(verification) in the detection of faint and potentially transient signals. The
SETI requirement for high time and frequency resolution is well matched to
wide-field VLBI techniques that permits the simultaneous analysis of thousands
of potential SETI targets within the field-of-view. Searching for a SETI signal
in the image plane has the important advantage that the signal location on the
sky is likely to be invariant on short timescales - this is a useful constraint
when potentially almost everything else could be changing (eg frequency drift
due to Doppler accelerations). Using archive data, we demonstrate how VLBI can
be used to conduct SETI searches. We target two targets within the field of
view - a galactic star and a galaxy at a redshift of 0.14. We place coarse
upper limits on any SETI signals from the two SETI targets, and note that while
the EIRP associated with the galaxy is comparable to the energy resources of a
Kardashev Type 2 civilisation, a distributed array of coherent transmitters
with excellent forward gain, could reduce this to more modest levels. We
therefore argue that targeted observations of extragalactic sources may also be
merited by interferometer surveys. Using VLBI to study the precise location and
motion of confirmed SETI signals is also discussed.

multi-temperature disk and a thermal Comptonization component which revealed
spectral variability where the primary distinction is the change in the optical
depth of the Comptonizing component, similar to what has been observed for
other ULXs. We also fitted the spectra with a general relativistic accretion
disk emission and a power-law component and found that it can reproduce a large
part but not all of the spectral variability of the source. The parameters for
the black hole mass and spin were found to be degenerate, but the high spin and
larger mass ($20-100\,\rm M_\odot$) solutions provided near Eddington accretion
rates consistent with the assumptions of the model. The spectral variation is
found to be driven by accretion rate changes leading to three different
spectral classes. Thus, our results suggest the possibility of a dominant
relativistic disk emission component for some of the spectral states of the

tool for increasing social welfare. One of the avenues taken in the past decade
is sugar consumption regulation by introducing a sugar tax. Such a tax
increases the price of extensive sugar containment in products such as soft
drinks. In this article we consider a typical problem of optimal regulatory
policy design, where the task is to determine the sugar tax rate maximizing the
social welfare. We model the problem as a sequential game represented by the
three-level mathematical program. On the upper level, the government decides
upon the tax rate. On the middle level, producers decide on the product
pricing. On the lower level, consumers decide upon their preferences towards
the products. While the general problem is computationally intractable, the
problem with a few product types is polynomially solvable, even for an
arbitrary number of heterogeneous consumers. This paper presents a simple,
intuitive and easily implementable framework for computing optimal sugar tax in
a market with a few products. This resembles the reality as the soft drinks,
for instance, are typically categorized in either regular or no-sugar drinks,
e.g. Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero. We illustrate the algorithm using an example
based on the real data and draw conclusions for a specific local market.

example of discrete survival time with such recall error is time-to-pregnancy

demonstrated that retrospective TTP is subject to recall error and statistical
models focusing on TTP have not accounted for the recall error. We propose a
multistage model that utilizes women's retrospectively-reported TTP and
associated certainty to estimate the TTP distribution. Our proposed model
utilizes a discrete survival function that accounts for random heterogeneity
arising from between women TTP data as well as a multinomial regression model
to account for her certainty as accuracy may decline over time, i.e., depends
on time since pregnancy in estimating the TTP distribution. Other novel
features of the model include attention to whether the pregnancy was
(un)planned as well as providing an approach to predict survival function for
women without a reported TTP. Our model allows for the consideration of
covariates for each of the underlying factors of (un)planned pregnancy, measure
of certainty and TTP distribution. The proposed model is applicable for any
discrete survival time when certainty in reporting may be a consideration. We
use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the finite sample performance for the
proposed estimators. We illustrate our proposed method using data from Upstate

significance is unclear due to lack of reliable error estimates. We therefore
develop a method for accurately estimating parameter uncertainty based on

the convergence of the main optimization algorithm. We apply our method to the

Our analysis shows that the Ising model captures neuronal collective behavior
much better than the independent model during wakefulness, light sleep, and
deep sleep when both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons are modeled;
ignoring the inhibitory effects of I-neurons dramatically overestimates
synchrony among E-neurons. Furthermore, information-theoretic measures reveal
that the Ising model explains about 80%-95% of the correlations, depending on
sleep state and neuron type. Thermodynamic measures show signatures of
criticality, although we take this with a grain of salt as it may be merely a
reflection of long-range neural correlations.

n-step algorithms for optimal control. Unfortunately, this has rarely been
addressed in current research. This trade-off principle holds independent of
the choice of the algorithm, such as n-step SARSA, n-step Expected SARSA or
n-step Tree backup. A small n results in a large bias, while a large n leads to
large variance. The literature offers no straightforward recipe for the best
choice of this value. While currently all n-step algorithms use a fixed value
of n over the state space we extend the framework of n-step updates by allowing
each state to have its specific n.
  We propose a solution to this problem within the context of human aided
reinforcement learning. Our approach is based on the observation that a human
can learn more efficiently if she receives input regarding the criticality of a
given state and thus the amount of attention she needs to invest into the
learning in that state. This observation is related to the idea that each state
of the MDP has a certain measure of criticality which indicates how much the
choice of the action in that state influences the return. In our algorithm the
RL agent utilizes the criticality measure, a function provided by a human
trainer, in order to locally choose the best stepnumber n for the update of the

'effective medium theory' (EMT) to model the atomic interactions realistically.
We test the predictions from isomorph theory for structure and dynamics by
means of the radial distribution and the velocity autocorrelation functions, as
well as the rather dramatic prediction of instantaneous equilibration after a
jump between two isomorphic points. Many properties of crystals tend to be
dominated by defects and many of the properties associated with these defects
are expected to be isomorph invariant as well. This is investigated in this
paper for the case of vacancy diffusion. We find the predicted invariance of
structure and also of dynamics, though less rigorous. We show results on the
variation of the density scaling exponent $\gamma$, which can be related to the
Gr\""uneisen-parameter, for all six metals. We consider large density changes up
to a factor of two, corresponding to very high pressures. Unlike systems
modelled using the Lennard-Jones potential where the density scaling-exponent
$\gamma$ is almost constant, it varies substantially when using the EMT
potential and is also strongly material dependent.

slower light-curve decline rates. This is consistent with the correlation

probability flux and velocity characterize time-varying and steady-state
properties of these systems, including high probability paths, barriers,
checkpoints among different stable regions, as well as mechanisms of dynamic
switching among them. However, conventional fluxes on continuous space are
ill-defined and are problematic when at boundaries of the state space or when
copy numbers are small. By re-defining the derivative and divergence operators
based on the discrete nature of reactions, we introduce new formulations of
discrete fluxes. Our flux model fully accounts for the discreetness of both the
state space and the jump processes of reactions. The reactional discrete flux
satisfies the continuity equation and describes the behavior of the system
evolving along directions of reactions. The species discrete flux directly
describes the dynamic behavior in the state space of the reactants such as the
transfer of probability mass. With the relationship between these two fluxes
specified, we show how to construct time-evolving and steady-state global
flow-maps of probability flux and velocity in the directions of every species
at every microstate, and how they are related to the outflow and inflow of
probability fluxes when tracing out reaction trajectories. We also describe how
to impose proper conditions enabling exact quantification of flux and velocity
in the boundary regions, without the difficulty of enforcing artificial
reflecting conditions. We illustrate the computation of probability flux and
velocity using three model systems, namely, the birth-death process, the
bistable Schl\""ogl model, and the oscillating Schnakenberg model.

research shows that the quality of deposition measured by flattening ratio of
the bonded particle is associated with impact velocity, angle and particle
size. Therefore, the original idea of CLIAO is to improve the quality of
deposition by obtaining the maximum flattening ratio which is extracted from
the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation snapshots directly. To complete this
strategy, a Python script is suggested to generate the required snapshots from
result files automatically and the image processing technique is used to
evaluate the flattening ratio from the snapshots. Moreover, three optimization
methods including surrogate optimization (Efficient Global Optimization) and
heuristic algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Different Evolution
algorithm) are engaged. Then a back propagation neural network (BPNN) is used
to accelerate the process of optimization, where the BPNN is used to build the
meta-model instead of the forward calculation. The optimization result
demonstrates that all the above methods can obtain the acceptable solution. The
comparison between those methods is also given and the selection of them should
be determined by the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

$\lambda_i$ be a Borel probability measure on $K_i$ for each $i$. Let
$f:\prod_i K_i \to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded and continuous potential function,
and let $$\mu(d \mathbf{x})\ \propto\ e^{f(\mathbf{x})}\lambda_1(d x_1)\cdots
\lambda_n(d x_n)$$ be the associated Gibbs distribution. At each point
$\mathbf{x} \in \prod_i K_i$, one can define a `discrete gradient' $\nabla
f(\mathbf{x},\,\cdot\,)$ by comparing the values of $f$ at all points which
differ from $\mathbf{x}$ in at most one coordinate. In case $\prod_i K_i =
\{-1,1\}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, the discrete gradient $\nabla
f(\mathbf{x},\,\cdot\,)$ is naturally identified with a vector in
$\mathbb{R}^n$.
  This paper shows that a `low-complexity' assumption on $\nabla f$ implies
that $\mu$ can be approximated by a mixture of other measures, relatively few
in number, and most of them close to product measures in the sense of optimal
transport. This implies also an approximation to the partition function of $f$
in terms of product measures, along the lines of Chatterjee and Dembo's theory
of `nonlinear large deviations'.
  An important precedent for this work is a result of Eldan in the case
$\prod_i K_i = \{-1,1\}^n$. Eldan's assumption is that the discrete gradients
$\nabla f(\mathbf{x},\,\cdot\,)$ all lie in a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that has
small Gaussian width. His proof is based on the careful construction of a
diffusion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which starts at the origin and ends with the
desired distribution on the subset $\{-1,1\}^n$. Here our assumption is a more
naive covering-number bound on the set of gradients $\{\nabla
f(\mathbf{x},\,\cdot\,):\ \mathbf{x} \in \prod_i K_i\}$, and our proof relies
only on basic inequalities of information theory. As a result, it is shorter,
and applies to Gibbs measures on arbitrary product spaces.

However, state-of-the-art predictive algorithms are typically black-boxes,
learning statistical interactions that are difficult to translate into testable
hypotheses. The iterative Random Forest algorithm took a step towards bridging
this gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the
stable, high-order feature interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of
Random Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions identified by iRF to
explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method,
signed iRF, describes subsets of rules that frequently occur on RF decision
paths. We refer to these rule subsets as signed interactions. Signed
interactions share not only the same set of interacting features but also
exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent
functional relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe
stable and predictive importance metrics to rank signed interactions. For each
SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior
under known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically
inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and
spatial gene expression patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF
recovers one of the few experimentally validated high-order interactions and
suggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active. In the
case of spatial gene expression patterns, s-iRF recovers all 11 reported links

study, we analyze forecasts submitted to the Community Coordinated Modeling

answer the following questions: (1) How well do these models forecast the
arrival time of CME-driven shocks? (2) What are the uncertainties associated

become more accurate during the past six years? We analyze all forecasts made

all of which were forecasted by six models. We find that the models are
generally able to predict CME-shock arrival times -- in an average sense -- to
within 10 hours, but with standard deviations often exceeding 20 hours. The
best performers, on the other hand, maintained a mean error (bias) of -1 hour,
a mean absolute error of 13 hours, and a precision (s.d.) of 15 hours. Finally,
there is no evidence that the forecasts have become more accurate during this

  and Multigrid Reduction in Time","37 pages, accepted in SIMAX",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parareal and multigrid reduction in time (MGRiT) are two of the most popular
parallel-in-time methods. The idea is to treat time integration in a parallel
context by using a multigrid method in time. If $\Phi$ is a (fine-grid)
time-stepping scheme, let $\Psi$ denote a ""coarse-grid"" time-stepping scheme
chosen to approximate $k$ steps of $\Phi$, $k\geq 1$. In particular, $\Psi$
defines the coarse-grid correction, and evaluating $\Psi$ should be
(significantly) cheaper than evaluating $\Phi^k$.
  A number of papers have studied the convergence of Parareal and MGRiT.
However, there have yet to be general conditions developed on the convergence
of Parareal or MGRiT that answer simple questions such as, (i) for a given
$\Phi$ and $k$, what is the best $\Psi$, or (ii) can Parareal/MGRiT converge
for my problem? This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the
convergence of Parareal and MGRiT applied to linear problems, along with tight
two-level convergence bounds. Results rest on the introduction of a ""temporal
approximation property"" (TAP) that indicates how $\Phi^k$ must approximate the
action of $\Psi$ on different vectors. Loosely, for unitarily diagonalizable
operators, the TAP indicates that fine-grid and coarse-grid time integration
schemes must integrate geometrically smooth spatial components similarly, and
less so for geometrically high frequency. In the (non-unitarily) diagonalizable
setting, the conditioning of each eigenvector, $\mathbf{v}_i$, must also be
reflected in how well $\Psi\mathbf{v}_i \sim\Phi^k\mathbf{v}_i$. In general,
worst-case convergence bounds are exactly given by $\min \varphi < 1$ such that
an inequality along the lines of $\|(\Psi-\Phi^k)\mathbf{v}\| \leq\varphi \|(I
- \Psi)\mathbf{v}\|$ holds for all $\mathbf{v}$. Such inequalities are
formalized as different realizations of the TAP, and form the basis for
convergence of MGRiT and Parareal.

instability of the Linet - Tian solution to the case $\Lambda > 0$. A
fundamental difference brought about by $\Lambda >0$, as compared to

each of the two commuting Killing vectors $\partial_{\phi}$, and
$\partial_{z}$, there is a curvature singularity that has the same
characteristics as that associated to $\partial_{\phi}$ in the Levi - Civita
metric, and we show that there is an isometry relating these singularities that
reduces the effective parameter space of the metrics. In attempting to set up
and solve the linearized perturbation equations we are confronted with the
problem of a gauge ambiguity that leads to the introduction of a gauge
invariant function, $W_1$, that is shown to be also a {\em master function},
that satisfies a second order ODE, and in terms of which one can express all
the perturbation functions. Unfortunately, the equation satisfied by $W_1$
contains singular coefficients, and, although {\em all} its solutions are
regular, because of the presence of these singularities one cannot, as in the
case of negative $\Lambda$, set up an associated self adjoint problem that
provides a complete set of solutions for $W_1$. We are thus restricted to
solving numerically the perturbation equations, and using those solutions for
constructing $W_1$, for particular values of the parameters. In all the cases
analyzed we find unstable modes, which strongly suggests that all the Linet -
Tian space times with $\Lambda > 0$ are linearly unstable under gravitational
perturbations. The problem of determining the time evolution of arbitrary
initial data in terms of the $W_1$, or something equivalent, remains open.

challenging task due to the large variation and content mismatch between short
utterances. I-vector based systems have become the standard in speaker
verification applications, but they are less effective with short utterances.
In this paper, we first compare two state-of-the-art universal background model
training methods for i-vector modeling using full-length and short utterance
evaluation tasks. The two methods are Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based and
deep neural network (DNN) based methods. The results indicate that the
I-vector_DNN system outperforms the I-vector_GMM system under various
durations. However, the performances of both systems degrade significantly as
the duration of the utterances decreases. To address this issue, we propose two
novel nonlinear mapping methods which train DNN models to map the i-vectors
extracted from short utterances to their corresponding long-utterance
i-vectors. The mapped i-vector can restore missing information and reduce the
variance of the original short-utterance i-vectors. The proposed methods both
model the joint representation of short and long utterance i-vectors by using
autoencoder. Experimental results using the NIST SRE 2010 dataset show that
both methods provide significant improvement and result in a max of 28.43%
relative improvement in Equal Error Rates from a baseline system, when using
deep encoder with residual blocks and adding an additional phoneme vector. When
further testing the best-validated models of SRE10 on the Speaker In The Wild

Gaussian process regression to perform predictions based on the similarity

apply the marginalized graph kernel, a spatial adjacency rule is first employed
to convert molecules into graphs whose vertices and edges are labeled by

the efficient evaluation of the kernel. Specific functional components for the
marginalized graph kernel are proposed, while the effect of the associated
hyperparameters on accuracy and predictive confidence are examined. We show
that the graph kernel is particularly suitable for predicting extensive

large rainfall events, makes it difficult to develop strategies to mitigate
related hazards, like flooding. Latent spatial extremes models reduce
uncertainty by exploiting spatial dependence in statistical characteristics of
extreme events to borrow strength across locations. However, these estimates
can have poor properties due to model misspecification: many latent spatial
extremes models do not account for extremal dependence, which is spatial
dependence in the extreme events themselves. We improve estimates from latent
spatial extremes models that make conditional independence assumptions by
proposing a weighted likelihood that uses the extremal coefficient to
incorporate information about extremal dependence during estimation. This
approach differs from, and is simpler than, directly modeling the spatial
extremal dependence; for example, by fitting a max-stable process, which is

approximation. However, for a shock propagating parallel to a magnetic field,
magnetohydrodynamics states that the shock properties are independent of the
field strength, whereas recent Particle-in-Cell simulations reveal a
significant departure from magnetohydrodynamics behavior for such shocks in the
collisionless regime. This departure is found to be caused by a field-driven
anisotropy in the downstream pressure, but the functional dependence of this
anisotropy on the field strength is yet to be determined. Here, we present a
non-relativistic model of the plasma evolution through the shock front,
allowing for a derivation of the downstream anisotropy in terms of the field
strength. Our scenario assumes double adiabatic evolution of a pair plasma
through the shock front. As a result, the perpendicular temperature is
conserved. If the resulting downstream is firehose stable, then the plasma
remains in this state. If unstable, it migrates towards the firehose stability
threshold. In both cases, the conservation equations, together with the
relevant hypothesis made on the temperature, allows a full determination of the
downstream anisotropy in terms of the field strength.

increasing sizes of graphs, even traditionally fast clustering methods can be
computationally expensive for real-world graphs of interest. Scalability
problems led to the development of local graph clustering algorithms that come
with a variety of theoretical guarantees. Rather than return a global
clustering of the entire graph, local clustering algorithms return a single
cluster around a given seed node or set of seed nodes. These algorithms improve
scalability because they use time and memory resources that depend only on the
size of the cluster returned, instead of the size of the input graph. Indeed,
for many of them, their running time grows linearly with the size of the
output. In addition to scalability arguments, local graph clustering algorithms
have proven to be very useful for identifying and interpreting small-scale and
meso-scale structure in large-scale graphs. As opposed to heuristic operational
procedures, this class of algorithms comes with strong algorithmic and
statistical theory. These include statistical guarantees that prove they have
implicit regularization properties. One of the challenges with the existing
literature on these approaches is that they are published in a wide variety of
areas, including theoretical computer science, statistics, data science, and
mathematics. This has made it difficult to relate the various algorithms and
ideas together into a cohesive whole. We have recently been working on unifying
these diverse perspectives through the lens of optimization as well as
providing software to perform these computations in a cohesive fashion. In this
note, we provide a brief introduction to local graph clustering, we provide
some representative examples of our perspective, and we introduce our software
named Local Graph Clustering (LGC).

regulating star-formation in galaxies in dense environments. The Spitzer Planck
Herschel Infrared Cluster (SPHerIC) survey was initiated to identify these
characteristically faint and dust-reddened sources during the epoch of their
early assembly. We present Spitzer IRAC observations of 82 galaxy
(proto-)cluster candidates at 1.3<$z_p$<3.0 that were vetted in a two step
process: (1) using Planck to select by color those sources with the highest
star-formation rates, and (2) using Herschel at higher resolution to separate
out the individual red sources. The addition of the Spitzer data enables
efficient detection of the central and massive brightest red cluster galaxies
(BRCGs). We find that BRCGs are associated with highly significant, extended
and crowded regions of IRAC sources which are more overdense than the field.
This result corroborates our hypothesis that BRCGs within the Planck - Herschel
sources trace some of the densest and actively star-forming proto-clusters in
the early Universe. On the basis of a richness-mass proxy relation, we obtain
an estimate of their mean masses which suggests our sample consists of some of

formation and subsequently arrive on the passive cloud in specific star
formation rate (SSFR)-mass space - we find that the $\tau_{\rm Q}$ distribution
of high-mass centrals, low-mass centrals and satellites are divergent. In the
low stellar mass regime where $M_{\star}<10^{9.6}M_{\odot}$, centrals exhibit
systematically longer quenching timescales than satellites ($\approx 4$~Gyr
compared to $\approx 2$~Gyr). Satellites with low stellar mass relative to
their halo mass cause this disparity, with ram pressure stripping quenching
these galaxies rapidly. Low mass centrals are quenched as a result of stellar
feedback, associated with long $\tau_{\rm Q}\gtrsim 3$~Gyr. At intermediate
stellar masses where $10^{9.7}\,\rm M_{\odot}<M_{\star}<10^{10.3}\,\rm
M_{\odot}$, $\tau_{\rm Q}$ are the longest for both centrals and satellites,
particularly for galaxies with higher gas fractions. At $M_{\star}\gtrsim
10^{10.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, galaxy merger counts and black hole activity
increase steeply for all galaxies. Quenching timescales for centrals and
satellites decrease with stellar mass in this regime to $\tau_{\rm
Q}\lesssim2$~Gyr. In anticipation of new intermediate redshift observational
galaxy surveys, we analyse the passive and star-forming fractions of galaxies

range and energy of long distance nonlinear pulse propagation in the atmosphere
by moving to longer infrared wavelengths, with the purpose of mitigating the
effects of turbulence. In addition, picosecond and longer pulse durations are
being used to increase the pulse energy. While both of these tacks promise
improvements in applications, such as remote sensing and directed energy, they
open up fundamental issues regarding the standard model used to calculate the
nonlinear optical properties of dilute gases. Amongst these issues is that for
longer wavelengths and longer pulse durations, exponential growth of the
laser-generated electron density, the so-called avalanche ionization, can limit
the propagation range via nonlinear absorption and plasma defocusing. It is
therefore important for the continued development of the field to assess the
theory and role of avalanche ionization in gases for longer wavelengths. Here,
after an overview of the standard model, we present a microscopically motivated
approach for the analysis of avalanche ionization in gases that extends beyond
the standard model and we contend is key for deepening our understanding of
long distance propagation at long infrared wavelengths. Our new approach
involves the mean electron kinetic energy, the plasma temperature, and the free
electron density as dynamic variables. The rate of avalanche ionization is
shown to depend on the full time history of the pulsed excitation, as opposed
to the standard model in which the rate is proportional to the instantaneous
intensity.

  Queries","21 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The it Convex Hull Membership(CHM) problem is: Given a point $p$ and a subset
$S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^m$, is $p \in conv(S)$? CHM is not only a
fundamental problem in Linear Programming, Computational Geometry, Machine
Learning and Statistics, it also serves as a query problem in many applications
e.g. Topic Modeling, LP Feasibility, Data Reduction. The {\it Triangle
Algorithm} (TA) \cite{kalantari2015characterization} either computes an
approximate solution in the convex hull, or a separating hyperplane. The {\it
Spherical}-CHM is a CHM, where $p=0$ and each point in $S$ has unit norm.
First, we prove the equivalence of exact and approximate versions of CHM and
Spherical-CHM. On the one hand, this makes it possible to state a simple
version of the original TA. On the other hand, we prove that under the
satisfiability of a simple condition in each iteration, the complexity improves
to $O(1/\varepsilon)$. The analysis also suggests a strategy for when the
property does not hold at an iterate. This suggests the \textit{Spherical-TA}
which first converts a given CHM into a Spherical-CHM before applying the
algorithm. Next we introduce a series of applications of Spherical-TA. In
particular, Spherical-TA serves as a fast version of vanilla TA to boost its
efficiency. As an example, this results in a fast version of \emph{AVTA}
\cite{awasthi2018robust}, called \emph{AVTA$^+$} for solving exact or
approximate irredundancy problem. Computationally, we have considered CHM, LP
and Strict LP Feasibility and the Irredundancy problem. Based on substantial
amount of computing, Spherical-TA achieves better efficiency than state of the
art algorithms. Leveraging on the efficiency of Spherical-TA, we propose
AVTA$^+$ as a pre-processing step for data reduction which arises in such
applications as in computing the Minimum Volume Enclosing Ellipsoid
\cite{moshtagh2005minimum}.

problems still requires intensive study because of the static and offline
nature of conventional deep learning approaches. A deep continual learning
algorithm, namely autonomous deep learning (ADL), is proposed in this paper.
Unlike traditional deep learning methods, ADL features a flexible structure
where its network structure can be constructed from scratch with the absence of
an initial network structure via the self-constructing network structure. ADL
specifically addresses catastrophic forgetting by having a different-depth
structure which is capable of achieving a trade-off between plasticity and
stability. Network significance (NS) formula is proposed to drive the hidden
nodes growing and pruning mechanism. Drift detection scenario (DDS) is put
forward to signal distributional changes in data streams which induce the
creation of a new hidden layer. The maximum information compression index
(MICI) method plays an important role as a complexity reduction module
eliminating redundant layers. The efficacy of ADL is numerically validated
under the prequential test-then-train procedure in lifelong environments using
nine popular data stream problems. The numerical results demonstrate that ADL
consistently outperforms recent continual learning methods while characterizing
the automatic construction of network structures.

calculate optical forces for straight and curved waveguide sections and all
possible excitation configurations for a given set of coupled eigenmodes, and
then compare the results for each of the known proposed optical force laws as
well as a novel one derived from this general stress tensor. We show that
proper use of the divergence theorem is crucial to account for all force terms,
many of which vanish if the procedure most commonly used is applied for
situations other than eigenmodes in straight waveguides. A better understanding
of how different stress tensors predict very different forces for certain
waveguide geometries opens a pathway for new experimental tests of each
formulation.

self-correcting behavior due to their iterative-convergent nature. Recent
systems exploit this property to achieve adaptability and efficiency in
unreliable computing environments by relaxing the consistency of execution and
allowing calculation errors to be self-corrected during training. However, the
behavior of such systems are only well understood for specific types of
calculation errors, such as those caused by staleness, reduced precision, or
asynchronicity, and for specific types of training algorithms, such as
stochastic gradient descent. In this paper, we develop a general framework to
quantify the effects of calculation errors on iterative-convergent algorithms
and use this framework to design new strategies for checkpoint-based fault
tolerance. Our framework yields a worst-case upper bound on the iteration cost
of arbitrary perturbations to model parameters during training. Our system,
SCAR, employs strategies which reduce the iteration cost upper bound due to
perturbations incurred when recovering from checkpoints. We show that SCAR can
reduce the iteration cost of partial failures by 78% - 95% when compared with
traditional checkpoint-based fault tolerance across a variety of ML models and

indispensable for increasing search accuracy, an excessive number of outgoing

Therefore, we propose three degree-adjustment methods: static degree adjustment
of not only outdegrees but also indegrees, dynamic degree adjustment with which

adjustment to remove edges that have alternative search paths to reduce

$O(10^{-2})$. Further, we present exact values of $\alpha(tri)$,

measurements comes from the neutrino-nucleus interaction part, and its accurate
understanding is essential for high-precision neutrino physics, namely for
studying CP violation in the lepton sector. Depending on neutrino beam
energies, quasi-elastic, resonance, Regge, or/and deep inelastic scattering
(DIS) processes contribute to the neutrino cross section. It is desirable to
have a code to calculate the neutrino-nucleus cross section in any kinematical
range by combining various theoretical descriptions. On the other hand, the
IceCube collaboration started obtaining cross section data up to the $10^{15}$
eV range, so that it became necessary to understand ultra-high-energy neutrino
interactions beyond the artificial lepton-accelerator energy range. For future
precise neutrino physics including the CP measurement, it is also necessary to
understand accurate nuclear corrections. The current status is explained for
nuclear corrections in DIS structure functions. The possibility is also
discussed to find gravitational sources within nucleons and nuclei, namely
matrix elements of quark-gluon energy-momentum tensor. They could be probed by
neutrino interactions without replying on direct ultra-weak ""gravitational
interactions"" with high-intensity neutrino beams, possibly at a future neutrino
factory, by using techniques of hadron tomography.

represents a significant limitation for comprehensive chemical identification
of small molecules in complex samples since this process is time-consuming and

leading to a need for standards-free identification. To address this need, we
are advancing chemical property calculations and developing multi-attribute

platforms through the utilization and creation of the in silico Chemical
Library Engine (ISiCLE) and the Multi-Attribute Matching Engine (MAME). Here,
we describe our results in a blinded analysis of synthetic chemical mixtures as

high confidence identifications, the FDR was 35%. After unblinding of the
sample compositions, we improved our approach by optimizing the scoring

perform recognition in each space, where the uncertain space contains instances

bandits are a sub-class of MABs where, at every time step, the learner has
access to side information that is predictive of the best arm. Simple regret
minimization assumes that the learner only incurs regret after a pure
exploration phase. In this work, we study simple regret minimization for
contextual bandits. Motivated by applications where the learner has separate
training and autonomous modes, we assume that the learner experiences a pure
exploration phase, where feedback is received after every action but no regret
is incurred, followed by a pure exploitation phase in which regret is incurred
but there is no feedback. We present the Contextual-Gap algorithm and establish
performance guarantees on the simple regret, i.e., the regret during the pure

represent admissible inferences, while remaining in the intuitionistic world by
having normal forms that are just intuitionistic terms. We then extend
intuitionistic logic with principles corresponding to admissible rules. As an
example, we consider the Kreisel-Putnam logic KP, for which we prove the strong
normalization and the disjunction property through our term assignment. This is
our first step in understanding the essence of admissible rules for

east half of the cold front, we found a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI)
layer candidate. The measured width-to-azimuthal extension ratio and the
thermodynamic properties are all consistent with it being a KHI layer currently
developing along the sloshing cold front. We found a thermal pressure deficit
of the order of 10$^{-2}~\mathrm{keV~cm^{-3}}$ at the KHI layer. Assuming that
turbulent pressure fully supports the pressure deficit, we estimated the
turbulent strength at several hundred km~s$^{-1}$, which translates into the
turbulent heating rate of $Q_\mathrm{turb}\sim
10^{-26}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}}$. This value agrees within an order of
magnitude with the previous estimation derived from the surface brightness
fluctuations, and can balance the radiative cooling at this radius. In the west

relationships for later use is a non-trivial task. One such relationship would
be between railroad accidents' causes and their correspondent descriptions in
reports. From 2001 to 2016 rail accidents in the U.S. cost more than $4.6B.
Railroads involved in accidents are required to submit an accident report to
the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). These reports contain a variety of
fixed field entries including primary cause of the accidents (a coded variable
with 389 values) as well as a narrative field which is a short text description
of the accident. Although these narratives provide more information than a
fixed field entry, the terminologies used in these reports are not easy to
understand by a non-expert reader. Therefore, providing an assisting method to
fill in the primary cause from such domain specific texts(narratives) would
help to label the accidents with more accuracy. Another important question for
transportation safety is whether the reported accident cause is consistent with
narrative description. To address these questions, we applied deep learning
methods together with powerful word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe to
classify accident cause values for the primary cause field using the text in
the narratives. The results show that such approaches can both accurately
classify accident causes based on report narratives and find important
inconsistencies in accident reporting.

nuanced than the simple dichotomy it might appear to be at first sight.
  This commentary is structured as follows. In Section 2 I briefly summarise
the arguments of F++ and comment on their approach. Next, in Section 3, I take
a step back to consider the nature of representativeness in inferential
arguments and the need for careful definition. Then I give three examples of
using different types of participant to consider impact. I conclude by arguing,
largely in agreement with F++, that the question of whether student
participants are representative or not depends on the target population.
However, we need to give careful consideration to defining that population and,
in particular, not to overlook the representativeness of tasks and environment.
This is facilitated by explicit description of the target populations.

function. This gives rise to an effective long-range self-trapping interaction,
which may act alone, or be combined with the contact cubic nonlinearity. The
system is made discrete by loading the BEC into a deep optical-lattice
potential. Numerical solutions demonstrate that onsite-centered fundamental
solitons are stable in the cases of attractive or zero contact interactions,
while offsite-centered solitons are unstable. In the case of the repulsive
onsite nonlinearity, offsite solitons are stable, while their onsite-centered
counterparts are stable only at sufficiently small values of the norm, where
bistability between the off- and onsite-centered mode takes place. The shape of
the onsite-centered solitons is very accurately predicted by a variational
approximation (which includes essential technical novelties).
Spatially-antisymmetric (\textquotedblleft twisted"") solitons are stable at
small values of the norm, being unstable at larger norms. In the strongly
asymmetric version of the two-component system, which includes the Zeeman

Estimation and Multi-Task Linear Discriminant Analysis. We assume the so-called
spiked covariance model for $\Sigma$, and exploit recent advances in
understanding that model, to derive a nonlinear shrinker which is
asymptotically optimal among orthogonally-equivariant procedures. In our
asymptotic study, the number of variables $p$ is comparable to the number of
observations $n$. The form of the optimal nonlinearity depends on the aspect
ratio $\gamma=p/n$ of the data matrix and on the top eigenvalue of $\Sigma$.
For $\gamma > 0.618...$, even dependence on the top eigenvalue can be avoided.
The optimal shrinker has two notable properties. First, when $p/n \rightarrow
\gamma \gg 1$ is large, it shrinks even very large eigenvalues substantially,
by a factor $1/(1+\gamma)$. Second, even for moderate $\gamma$, certain highly
statistically significant eigencomponents will be completely suppressed. We
show that when $\gamma \gg 1$ is large, purely diagonal covariance matrices can
be optimal, despite the top eigenvalues being large and the empirical
eigenvalues being highly statistically significant. This aligns with
practitioner experience. We identify intuitively reasonable procedures with
small worst-case relative regret - the simplest being generalized soft
thresholding having threshold at the bulk edge and slope $(1+\gamma)^{-1}$
above the bulk. For $\gamma < 2$ it has at most a few percent relative regret.

to infer the spatial distribution of subsurface elastic properties. These

those associated with poor well-log data, upscaling and noise within the
seismic data. We express uncertain well-log samples, due to bad logging reads
and upscaling, in terms of local probability distribution functions (PDFs).
Local PDFs are used as conditioning data to a stochastic sequential simulation
algorithm, included as the model perturbation within the inversion. The problem
of noisy seismic and narrow exploration of the model parameter space,
particularly at early steps of the inversion, is tackled by the introduction of
a cap on local correlation coefficients responsible for the generation of the
new set of models during the next iteration. A single geostatistical framework
is proposed and illustrated with its application to a real case study. When
compared against a conventional iterative geostatistical seismic inversion, the
integration of additional sources of uncertainty increases the match between
real and inverted seismic traces and the variability within the ensemble of
models inverted at the last iteration. The selection of the local PDFs plays a
central role in the reliability of the inverted elastic models. Avoiding high
local correlation coefficients at early stages of the inversion increases
convergence in terms of global correlation between synthetic and real seismic
reflection data at the end of the inversion.

powerful in a wide variety of applications. However, training these models

assignment considerably more challenging. Furthermore, the nature of
back-propagation itself does not permit the use of non-differentiable
activation functions and is inherently sequential, making parallelization of
the underlying training process difficult. Here, we propose the Parallel
Temporal Neural Coding Network (P-TNCN), a biologically inspired model trained
by the learning algorithm we call Local Representation Alignment. It aims to
resolve the difficulties and problems that plague recurrent networks trained by
back-propagation through time. The architecture requires neither unrolling in
time nor the derivatives of its internal activation functions. We compare our
model and learning procedure to other back-propagation through time
alternatives (which also tend to be computationally expensive), including
real-time recurrent learning, echo state networks, and unbiased online
recurrent optimization. We show that it outperforms these on sequence modeling
benchmarks such as Bouncing MNIST, a new benchmark we denote as Bouncing
NotMNIST, and Penn Treebank. Notably, our approach can in some instances
outperform full back-propagation through time as well as variants such as
sparse attentive back-tracking. Significantly, the hidden unit correction phase
of P-TNCN allows it to adapt to new datasets even if its synaptic weights are
held fixed (zero-shot adaptation) and facilitates retention of prior generative
knowledge when faced with a task sequence. We present results that show the
P-TNCN's ability to conduct zero-shot adaptation and online continual sequence

interest is in micrometre-range porosity since these pores are able to store
water that is easily available for plants. Gas adsorption measurements which
are commonly used to characterize the physical pore structure of biochars are
not able to quantify this pore-size range. While pyrogenetic porosity (i.e.
pores formed during pyrolysis process) tends to increase with elevated process
temperature, it is uncertain whether this change affects the pore space capable
to store plant available water. In this study, we characterized biochar
porosity with x-ray tomography which provides quantitative information on the
micrometer-range porosity. We imaged willow dried at 60 $^\circ$C and biochar
samples pyrolysed in three different temperatures (peak temperatures 308, 384,
489 $^\circ$C, heating rate 2 $^\circ$C min$^{-1}$). Samples were carefully
prepared and traced through the experiments, which allowed investigation of
porosity development in micrometre size range. Pore space was quantified with
image analysis of x-ray tomography images and, in addition, nanoscale porosity
was examined with helium ion microscopy. The image analysis results show that
initial pore structure of the raw material determines the properties of
micrometre-range porosity in the studied temperature range. Thus, considering
the pore-size regime relevant to the storage of plant available water,
pyrolysis temperature in the studied range does not provide means to optimize
the biochar structure. However, these findings do not rule out that process

[ICALP 2018] have shown that each sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers

and cost-efficient services to cloud users on demand and pay-per-utilization
basis. However, vast diversity in available cloud service providers leads to
numerous challenges for users to determine and select the best suitable
service. Also, sometimes users need to hire the required services from multiple
CSPs which introduce difficulties in managing interfaces, accounts, security,
supports, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To circumvent such problems
having a Cloud Service Broker (CSB) be aware of service offerings and users
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements will benefit both the CSPs as well as
users. In this work, we proposed a Fuzzy Rough Set based Cloud Service
Brokerage Architecture, which is responsible for ranking and selecting services
based on users QoS requirements, and finally monitor the service execution. We
have used the fuzzy rough set technique for dimension reduction. Used weighted
Euclidean distance to rank the CSPs. To prioritize user QoS request, we
intended to use user assign weights, also incorporated system assigned weights
to give the relative importance to QoS attributes. We compared the proposed
ranking technique with an existing method based on the system response time.
The case study experiment results show that the proposed approach is scalable,
resilience, and produce better results with less searching time.

effect of the corridor width in front of a bottleneck on the density. The idea
is based on a previous study suggesting that a guiding system in front of an
entrance can reduce pushing of the waiting people and thus the density at the
entrance. In our study we aim to find out to what extend the corridor width has
an impact on crowding or queuing behavior and with that on the density. The
results of the presented experiment suggest that the transition takes place
between a corridor width of 1.2 m and 2.3 m. The total duration of each
experimental run is not significantly influenced by the corridor width but by
the width of the entrance itself, the number of participants and partly by the
motivation. In general, the density in front of the gate as well as the area of
high density is increased by widening the corridor and by intensifying the
motivation of the participants. However, the results also suggest that also the
number of participants significantly influences the occurrence of pushing and
the level of density.

fragmentation of the Tunguska Cosmic Body (TCB) by taking into account the
possibility that a metre-sized fragment could cause the formation of the Lake
Cheko, located at about $9$~km North-West from the epicentre. We performed
order-of-magnitude calculations by using the classical single-body theory for
the atmospheric dynamics of comets/asteroids, with the addition of the
fragmentation conditions by Foschini (2001). We calibrated the numerical model
by using the data of the Chelyabinsk Event (CE) of 2013 February 15. Our work
favours the hypothesis that the TCB could have been a rubble-pile asteroid
composed by boulders with very different materials with different mechanical
strengths, density, and porosity. Before the impact, a close encounter with the
Earth stripped at least one boulder, which fell aside the main body and
excavated the Lake Cheko. We exclude the hypothesis of a single compact
asteroid ejecting a metre-sized fragment during, or shortly before, the
airburst, because there is no suitable combination of boulder mass and lateral
velocity.

systems, many optimization methods have been applied to solve the
stochastic/uncertain transmission-constrained unit commitment (TCUC) problem.
Among all methods, two-stage and multi-stage robust optimization-based methods
are the most widely adopted ones. In the two-stage methods, nonanticipativity
of economic dispatch (ED) decisions are not considered. While in multi-stage
methods, explicit decision rules (for example, affine decision rules) are
usually adopted to guarantee nonanticipativity of ED decisions. With explicit
decision rules, the computational burden can be heavy and the optimality of the
solution is affected. In this paper, a multi-stage robust TCUC formulation with
implicit decision rules is proposed, as well as a decomposition framework to
solve it. The solutions are proved to be multi-stage robust and
nonanticipativity of ED decisions is guaranteed. Meanwhile, a computationally
efficient time-decoupled solution method for the feasibility check subproblems
is also proposed such that the method is suitable for large-scale TCUC problems
with uncertain loads/renewable injections. Numerical tests are conducted on the

radially directed toward these clumps (at T_d ~ 25 - 32 K). The analysis of the

toward both the clumps, suggesting the ongoing SF activities. In each IRAS

of H II regions, which are powered by B-type stars. In the site IRAS
17008-4040, a previously known O-star candidate without an H II region is
identified as an infrared counterpart of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission
(i.e. IRcmme). Based on the VLT/NACO adaptive-optics L' image (resolution ~ 0.1
arcsec), the source IRcmme is resolved into two objects (i.e. IRcmme1 and
IRcmme2) within a scale of 900 AU that are found to be associated with the ALMA
core G345.50M. IRcmme1 is characterized as the main accreting HMPO candidate
before the onset of an ultracompact H II region. In the site IRAS 17009-4042,
the 1.28 GHz map has resolved two radio sources that were previously reported
as a single radio peak. Altogether, in each IRAS site, the junction of the

infrared-excess sources and the ongoing massive SF. These evidences are
consistent with the ""hub-filament"" systems as proposed by Myers (2009).

above completeness magnitude mc, is well described by the Gutenberg-Richter
law. The parameter mc however varies in space due to the seismic network
configuration, yielding a convoluted FMD shape below max(mc). This paper
investigates the shape of the generalized FMD (GFMD), which may be described as
a mixture of elemental FMDs (eFMDs) defined as asymmetric Laplace distributions
of mode mc [Mignan, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JB009347]. An asymmetric
Laplace mixture model (GFMD- ALMM) is thus proposed with its parameters
(detection parameter kappa, Gutenberg-Richter beta-value, mc distribution, as
well as number K and weight w of eFMD components) estimated using a
semi-supervised hard expectation maximization approach including BIC penalties
for model complexity. The performance of the proposed method is analysed, with
encouraging results obtained: kappa, beta, and the mc distribution range are
retrieved for different GFMD shapes in simulations, as well as in regional
catalogues (southern and northern California, Nevada, Taiwan, France), in a
global catalogue, and in an aftershock sequence (Christchurch, New Zealand). We
find max(mc) to be conservative compared to other methods, kappa = k/log(10) =
3 in most catalogues (compared to beta = b/log(10) = 1), but also that biases
in kappa and beta may occur when rounding errors are present below
completeness. The GFMD-ALMM, by modelling different FMD shapes in an autonomous
manner, opens the door to new statistical analyses in the realm of incomplete
seismicity data, which could in theory improve earthquake forecasting by
considering c. ten times more events.

volatility smiles. The technique is widely used in the FX markets context, due
to its ability to consistently construct the entire Lognormal smile using only
three Lognormal market quotes. However, the derivation of the Vanna-Volga
method itself is free of distributional assumptions. With this is mind, it is
surprising there have been no attempts to apply the method to Normal
volatilities (the current standard for interest rate markets). We show how the
method can be modified to build Normal volatility smiles. As it turns out, only
minor modifications are required compared to the Lognormal case. Moreover, as
the inversion of Normal volatilities from option prices is easier in the Normal
case, the smile construction can occur at a machine-precision level using
analytical formulae, making the approximations via Taylor-series unnecessary.
Apart from being based on practical and intuitive hedging arguments, the
Vanna-Volga has further important advantages. In comparison to the Normal SABR
model, the Vanna-Volga can easily fit both classical convex and atypical
concave smiles (frowns). Concave smile patterns are sometimes observed around
ATM strikes in the interest rate markets, particularly in the situations of
anticipated jumps (with an unclear outcome) in interest rates. Besides,
concavity is often observed towards the lower/left end of the Normal volatility
smiles of interest rates. At least in these situations, the Vanna-Volga can be
expected to interpolate/extrapolate better than SABR.

collision-coalescence process can faithfully represent mean droplet growth in
turbulent clouds. But an open question is how accurately the superdroplet
algorithm accounts for fluctuations in the collisional aggregation process.
Such fluctuations are particularly important in dilute suspensions. Even in the
absence of turbulence, Poisson fluctuations of collision times in dilute
suspensions may result in substantial variations in the growth process,
resulting in a broad distribution of growth times to reach a certain droplet
size. We quantify the accuracy of the superdroplet algorithm in describing the
fluctuating growth history of a larger droplet that settles under the effect of
gravity in a quiescent fluid and collides with a dilute suspension of smaller
droplets that were initially randomly distributed in space ('lucky droplet
model'). We assess the effect of fluctuations upon the growth history of the
lucky droplet and compute the distribution of cumulative collision times. The
latter is shown to be sensitive enough to detect the subtle increase of
fluctuations associated with collisions between multiple lucky droplets. The
superdroplet algorithm incorporates fluctuations in two distinct ways: through
the random spatial distribution of superdroplets and through the Monte Carlo
collision algorithm involved. Using specifically designed numerical
experiments, we show that both on their own give an accurate representation of
fluctuations. We conclude that the superdroplet algorithm can faithfully
represent fluctuations in the coagulation of droplets driven by gravity.

configuration and a complex magnetic ground state with both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic orders. Such a magnetic state is attributed to presence of
distorted Mn$_6$C octahedra with long and short Mn--Mn bonds. Our studies show
that C deficiency increases the tensile strain on the Mn$_6$C octahedra which
elongates Mn--Mn bonds and strengthens ferromagnetic interactions while Sn
deficiency tends to ease out the strain resulting in shorter as well as longer
Mn--Mn bond distances in comparison with stoichiometric Mn$_3$SnC. Such a
variation strengthens both, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.
Thus the structural strain caused by both Sn and C is responsible for complex
magnetic ground state of Mn$_3$SnC.

tasks from a single (one-shot) third-person demonstration video. To our

The key novelty lies in pre-training a feature extractor for creating a
perceptual representation for actions that we call 'action vectors'. The action
vectors are extracted using a 3D-CNN model pre-trained as an action classifier
on a generic action dataset. The distance between the action vectors from the
observed third-person demonstration and trial robot executions is used as a
reward for reinforcement learning of the demonstrated task. We report on
experiments in simulation and on a real robot, with changes in viewpoint of
observation, properties of the objects involved, scene background and
morphology of the manipulator between the demonstration and the learning
domains. O2A outperforms baseline approaches under different domain shifts and
has comparable performance with an oracle (that uses an ideal reward function).

traveling waves with oscillations for time-delayed nonlocal dispersion
equations. We first theoretically prove that all traveling waves, especially
the critical oscillatory traveling waves, are globally stable in a certain
weighted space, where the convergence rates to the non-critical oscillatory
traveling waves are time-exponential, and the convergence to the critical
oscillatory traveling waves are time-algebraic. Both of the rates are optimal.
The approach adopted is the weighted energy method with the fundamental
solution theory for time-delayed equations. Secondly, we carry out numerical
computations in different cases, which also confirm our theoretical results.
Because of oscillations of the solutions and nonlocality of the equation, the
numerical results obtained by the regular finite difference scheme are not
stable, even worse to be blow-up. In order to overcome these obstacles, we
propose a new finite difference scheme by adding artificial viscosities to both
sides of the equation, and obtain the desired numerical results.

observable lower bounds for the convex roof of the $l_{1}$-norm of coherence,

proposed that the detection of this tail can offer an unambiguous way to
distinguish between the hadron beam scenario and the standard one, which
instead assumes gamma-ray emission from the jet strongly depleted at the
highest energies ($E>30$ TeV) because of the interaction with the optical-IR
cosmic radiation field. We present dedicated simulations of observations
through the presently under construction Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) of the
very-high energy spectrum of the prototypical EHBL 1ES 0229+200 assuming the
two alternative models. We demonstrate that, considering 50 hours of
observations from the southern site of CTA (the most sensitive at the highest
energies), in the case of the hadron beam model it is possible to detect the
source up to 100 TeV. This, together with the non detection of the source above
10 TeV in the standard case, ensures that CTA observations can be effectively
used to unambiguously confirm or rule out the hadron beam scenario.

orbits around its host star, help us to characterize their atmospheres.
However, the variability of the host star can make their detection challenging:
the presence of starspots, faculae, flares and rotational effects introduce
brightness variations that can hide other flux variations related to the
presence of an exoplanet: ellipsoidal variation, Doppler boosting and a
combination of reflected light and thermal emission from the planet. Here we
present a study to quantify the effect of stellar variability on the
detectability of phase curves in the optical. On a first stage, we simulate
ideal data, with different white noise levels, and with cadences and total
duration matching a quarter of the \textit{Kepler} mission. We perform
injection and recovery tests to evaluate the minimum number of planetary orbits
that need to be observed in order to determine the amplitude of the phase curve
with an accuracy of 15\%. We also evaluate the effect of a simplistic stellar
variability signal with low amplitude, to provide strong constraints on the
minimum number of orbits needed under these ideal conditions. On a second
stage, we apply these methods to data from the quarter Q9 of the
\textit{Kepler} mission, known for its low instrumental noises. The injection
and recovery tests are performed on a selected sample of the less noisy stars
in different effective temperature ranges. Even for the shortest explored
planet period of 1 day, we obtain that observing a single orbit of the planet
fails to detect accurately more than 90\% of the inserted amplitude. The best
recovery rates, close to 48\%, are obtained after 10 orbits of a 1d period
planet with the largest explored amplitude of 150 ppm. The temperature range of

technique is demonstrated that visualises the presence and strength of atomic
movements leading to a period doubling of the unit cell along the beam
direction, using the intensity in an extra Laue zone ring in the back focal
plane recorded using a pixelated detector method. This method is used together
with conventional atomic resolution imaging in the plane perpendicular to the
beam direction to gain information about the 3D crystal structure in an
epitaxial thin film of LaFeO3 sandwiched between a substrate of (111) SrTiO3
and a top layer of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. It is found that a hitherto unreported
structure of LaFeO3 is formed under the unusual combination of compressive
strain and (111) growth, which is triclinic with a periodicity doubling from
primitive perovskite along one of the three <110> directions lying in the
growth plane. This results from a combination of La-site modulation along the
beam direction, and modulation of oxygen positions resulting from octahedral
tilting. This transition to the period-doubled cell is suppressed near both the
substrate and near the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 top layer due to the clamping of the
octahedral tilting by the absence of tilting in the substrate and due to an
incompatible tilt pattern being present in the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 layer. This work
shows a rapid and easy way of scanning for such transitions in thin films or
other systems where disorder-order transitions or domain structures may be
present and does not require the use of atomic resolution imaging, and could be
done on any scanning TEM instrument equipped with a suitable camera.

the signal lies on a single homogeneous domain. In contrast, many naturally
occurring signals lie on an inhomogeneous domain, such as brain activity
associated to different brain tissue. We propose an interpolation method that
instead exploits prior information about domain inhomogeneity, characterized by
different, potentially overlapping, subdomains. As proof of concept, the focus
is put on extending conventional shift-invariant B-spline interpolation. Given
a known inhomogeneous domain, B-spline interpolation of a given order is
extended to a domain-informed, shift-variant interpolation. This is done by
constructing a domain-informed generating basis that satisfies stability
properties. We illustrate example constructions of domain-informed generating
basis, and show their property in increasing the coherence between the
generating basis and the given inhomogeneous domain. By advantageously
exploiting domain knowledge, we demonstrate the benefit of domain-informed
interpolation over standard B-spline interpolation through Monte Carlo
simulations across a range of B-spline orders. We also demonstrate the
feasibility of domain-informed interpolation in a neuroimaging application
where the domain information is available by a complementary image contrast.
The results show the benefit of incorporating domain knowledge so that an
interpolant consistent to the anatomy of the brain is obtained.

dynamic side information induced by caches at base stations (BSs) to support
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) and achieve huge degrees of freedom (DoF) gains.
Due to the limited cache storage capacity, the performance of PHY caching
depends heavily on the cache content placement algorithm. In existing
algorithms, the cache content placement is adaptive to the long-term popularity
distribution in an offline manner. We propose an online PHY caching framework
which adapts the cache content placement to microscopic spatial and temporary
popularity variations to fully exploit the benefits of PHY caching.
Specifically, the joint optimization of online cache content placement and
content delivery is formulated as a mixed-timescale drift minimization problem
to increase the CoMP opportunity and reduce the cache content placement cost.
We propose a low-complexity algorithm to obtain a throughput-optimal solution.
Moreover, we provide a closed-form characterization of the maximum sum DoF in
the stability region and study the impact of key system parameters on the
stability region. Simulations show that the proposed online PHY caching
framework achieves large gain over existing solutions.

The task of scheduling a set of jobs on a given number of machines and
minimizing the makespan is well studied and among other results, we know that
EPTAS's for machine scheduling on identical machines exist. Das and Wiese
initiated the research on a generalization of makespan minimization, that
includes so called bag-constraints. In this variation of machine scheduling the
given set of jobs is partitioned into subsets, so called bags. Given this
partition a schedule is only considered feasible when on any machine there is
at most one job from each bag.
  Das and Wiese showed that this variant of machine scheduling admits a PTAS.
We will improve on this result by giving the first EPTAS for the machine
scheduling problem with bag-constraints. We achieve this result by using new
insights on this problem and restrictions given by the bag-constraints. We show
that, to gain an approximate solution, we can relax the bag-constraints and
ignore some of the restrictions. Our EPTAS uses a new instance transformation
that will allow us to schedule large and small jobs independently of each other
for a majority of bags. We also show that it is sufficient to respect the
bag-constraint only among a constant number of bags, when scheduling large
jobs. With these observations our algorithm will allow for some conflicts when
computing a schedule and we show how to repair the schedule in polynomial-time
by swapping certain jobs around.

technology (ICT) to manage traffic flow through highly congested and

to ensuring the efficiency and safety of our airspace, they are also
increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats that could potentially lead to
reduction in capacity and/or reorganization of traffic flows. In this paper, we
model various cyber threats to air traffic control systems, and analyze how
these attacks could impact the flow of aircraft through the airspace. To
perform this analysis, we consider a model for wide-area air traffic based on a
dynamic queuing network model. Then we introduce three different attacks (Route
Denial of Service, Route Selection Tampering, and Sector Denial of Service) to
the air traffic control system, and explore how these attacks manipulate the
sector flows by evaluating the queue backlogs for each sector's outflows.
Furthermore, we then explore graph-level vulnerability metrics to identify the
sectors that are most vulnerable to various flow manipulations, and compare
them to case-study simulations of the various attacks. The results suggest that
Route Denial of Service attacks have a significant impact on the target sector
and lead to the largest degradation to the overall air traffic flows.
Furthermore, the impact of Sector Denial of Service attack impacts are
primarily confined to the target sector, while the Route Selection Tampering
impacts are mostly confined to certain aircraft.

common sense has long been a critical-but-missing component of Artificial

highly specialized. Developers must carefully train or program systems for
every situation. General commonsense reasoning remains elusive. The absence of
common sense prevents intelligent systems from understanding their world,
behaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, communicating naturally with

matter (DM) sector and the fields of the Standard Model (SM). The interaction
of the DP, described by a broken $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry, with the SM is
usually generated at the one-loop level via kinetic mixing through the
existence of portal matter (PM), here assumed to be fermionic, which carries
both a dark charge as well as a SM $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge. For theoretical
consistency, as well as for many phenomenological reasons, this PM must be
vector-like with respect to the SM and dark gauge groups and, in particular, is
shown to be allowed only to transform as vector-like copies of the usual SM
fields. The dark Higgs that is responsible for the breaking of $U(1)_D$ can
then generate a mixing between the PM and SM fields with the same electric
charge thus altering the DP interactions with (at least some of) the SM fields
and also providing a path for the PM fields to decay. In this paper we briefly
explore the phenomenology of some specific simple models of this PM including,
for the case where the PM is leptonic in nature, their potential impact on
experiments probing low energy parity-violation and the g-2 of the muon. In the
case of color-triplet, bottom quark-like PM, their direct pair- and
single-production at the LHC is shown to be observable in final states that
include missing $E_T$ and/or very highly boosted lepton-jets together with
pairs of high $p_T$ b-jets that can be used to trigger on such events. These
signatures are quite distinct from those usually employed in the search for
vector-like quarks at the LHC and, furthermore, we demonstrate that the
conventional signal channels for vector-like quarks involving the SM Higgs and
gauge fields are essentially closed in the case of PM.

objects, with timely attention to black holes of different classes of mass and
their role as sources of gravitational waves.
  Such a breadth of topics reflects the growing role played by collisional
stellar dynamics in numerous areas of modern astrophysics. Indeed, in the next
decade, many revolutionary instruments will enable the derivation of positions
and velocities of individual stars in the Milky Way and its satellites and will
detect signals from a range of astrophysical sources in different portions of
the electromagnetic and gravitational spectrum, with an unprecedented
sensitivity. On the one hand, this wealth of data will allow us to address a
number of long-standing open questions in star cluster studies; on the other
hand, many unexpected properties of these systems will come to light,
stimulating further progress of our understanding of their formation and
evolution.

occluded from direct view, by analyzing indirect diffuse reflections off a
secondary, relay surface. Despite its many potential applications, existing
methods lack practical usability due to several shared limitations, including
the assumption of single scattering only, lack of occlusions, and Lambertian
reflectance. We lift these limitations by transforming the NLOS problem into a
virtual Line-Of-Sight (LOS) one. Since imaging information cannot be recovered
from the irradiance arriving at the relay surface, we introduce the concept of
the phasor field, a mathematical construct representing a fast variation in
irradiance. We show that NLOS light transport can be modeled as the propagation
of a phasor field wave, which can be solved accurately by the
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral. We demonstrate for the first time
NLOS reconstruction of complex scenes with strong multiply scattered and
ambient light, arbitrary materials, large depth range, and occlusions. Our
method handles these challenging cases without explicitly developing a light
transport model. By leveraging existing fast algorithms, we outperform existing
methods in terms of execution speed, computational complexity, and memory use.
We believe that our approach will help unlock the potential of NLOS imaging,
and the development of novel applications not restricted to lab conditions. For
example, we demonstrate both refocusing and transient NLOS videos of
real-world, complex scenes with large depth.

Propagation, which consists in solving the self-consistent recursion relations

numerically study very large system sizes and to directly access observables
related to the eigenfunctions and energy level statistics. In agreement with
recent works, we establish the existence of a delocalized non-ergodic phase on
Cayley trees. On random regular graphs instead our results indicate that
ergodicity is recovered when the system size is larger than a cross-over scale
$N_c (W)$, which diverges exponentially fast approaching the localization
transition. This scale corresponds to the size at which the mean-level spacing
becomes smaller than the Thouless energy $E_{Th} (W)$. Such energy scale, which
vanishes exponentially fast approaching the localization transition, is the one
below which ergodicity in the level statistics is restored in the thermodynamic
limit. Remarkably, the behavior of random regular graphs below $N_c (W)$
coincides with the one found close to the root of loop-less infinite Cayley
trees, {\it i.e.} only above $N_c (W)$ the effects of loops emerge and random
regular graphs behave differently from Cayley trees. Our results indicate that
ergodicity is recovered in the thermodynamic limit on random regular graph.
However, all observables probing volumes smaller than $N_c(W)$ and times
smaller than $\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ are expected to behave as if there were an
intermediate phase. Given the very fast divergence of $N_c(W)$ and
$\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ these non-ergodic effects are very pronounced in a large
region preceding the localization transition, and they can be related to the
intermediate phase present on Cayley trees.

model of cascading failure to temporal network data obtained from an
engineering project, where tasks constituting the entire project and
inter-dependencies between tasks correspond to time-stamped nodes and edges,
respectively. We numerically evaluate the performance of six strategies to
mitigate cascading failures. It is assumed that increased time between a pair
of inter-connected tasks acts as a buffer, preventing a failure to propagate
from one task to another. We show that, in a majority of cases that we
explored, temporal properties of the activities (i.e., start and end date of
each task in the project) are more relevant than their structural properties
(i.e., out-degree and the size of the out-component of the task) to preventing

radiation proportional to the number of particles - squared, through the
process of (spontaneous) superradiance (SP-SR) (in the sense of Dicke's). The
coherent SP-SR emission of a bunched electron beam can be even further enhanced
by a process of stimulated-superradiance (ST-SR) in the presence of a seed
injected radiation field. In this review, these coherent radiation emission
processes for both single bunch and periodically bunched beams are considered
in a model of radiation mode expansion.
  The general model of coherent spontaneous emission is extended to the
nonlinear regime, particularly for undulator (wiggler) interaction:
Tapering-Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification (TESSA).
  Processes of SP-SR and TESSA take place in tapered wiggler seed-injected

useful guidelines for the strategy of wiggler tapering efficiency and power

demonstrated for the so-called low-rank inducing Frobenius and spectral norms.
Moreover, the framework allows to compute the proximal mapping of compositions
of these norms with increasing convex functions and the projections onto their
epigraphs. This has the additional advantage that we can also deal with
compositions of increasing convex functions and low-rank inducing norms in
proximal splitting methods.

$8.0\pm0.5$ M$_{\oplus}$ and $7.4\pm0.5$ M$_{\oplus}$ in low-eccentricity
orbits with periods of $3.023\pm0.001$ d and $3.651\pm0.001$ d for GJ 3779 b

around 95 d can be attributed to the rotation of the stars. The addition of
these planets in a mass-period diagram of known planets around M dwarfs
suggests a bimodal distribution with a lack of short-period low-mass planets in
the range of 2-5 M$_{\oplus}$. It also indicates that super-Earths (> 5

explored in past decades. However, most previous studies assume that payoffs of
individuals are fully determined by the strategic behaviors of interacting
parties and social ties between them only serve as the indicator of the
existence of interactions. This assumption neglects important information
carried by inter-personal social ties such as genetic similarity, geographic
proximity, and social closeness, which may crucially affect the outcome of
interactions. To model these situations, we present a framework of evolutionary
multiplayer games on graphs with edge diversity, where different types of edges
describe diverse social ties. Strategic behaviors together with social ties
determine the resulting payoffs of interactants. Under weak selection, we
provide a general formula to predict the success of one behavior over the
other. We apply this formula to various examples which cannot be dealt with
using previous models, including the division of labor and relationship- or
edge-dependent games. We find that labor division facilitates collective
cooperation by decomposing a many-player game into several games of smaller
sizes. The evolutionary process based on relationship-dependent games can be
approximated by interactions under a transformed and unified game. Our work
stresses the importance of social ties and provides effective methods to reduce
the calculating complexity in analyzing the evolution of realistic systems.

instruments will come with wavefront sensing devices that allow control of the
ELT's intrinsic M4 and M5 wavefront correction units, thus building an adaptive
optics (AO) system. To take advantage of the ELT's optical performance, full
diffraction-limited operation is required and only a high performance AO system
can deliver this. Further technically challenging requirements for the AO come
from the exoplanet research field, where the task to resolve the very small
angular separations between host star and planet, has also to take into account
the high-contrast ratio between the two objects. We present in detail the
results of our simulations and their impact on high-contrast imaging in order
to find the optimal wavefront sensing device for the METIS instrument. METIS is
the mid-infrared imager and spectrograph for the ELT with specialised
high-contrast, coronagraphic imaging capabilities, whose performance strongly
depends on the AO residual wavefront errors. We examined the sky and target
sample coverage of a generic wavefront sensor in two spectral regimes, visible

wavefront sensor type analysis. We find that the near-infrared regime is the
most suitable for METIS. We then analysed the performance of Shack-Hartmann and
pyramid wavefront sensors under realistic conditions at the ELT, did a
balancing with our scientific requirements, and concluded that a pyramid
wavefront sensor is the best choice for METIS. For this choice we additionally
examined the impact of non-common path aberrations, of vibrations, and the
long-term stability of the SCAO system including high-contrast imaging
performance.

objects that display thermal X-ray emission within their radio shell. They are
an older class of SNRs, and as such are profoundly affected by the environment
into which they evolve. VRO 42.05.01 is a MM SNR of puzzling morphology in the
direction of the Galactic anticentre. Low-frequency radio observations of
supernova remnants are sensitive to synchrotron electrons accelerated in the
shock front. We aim to compare the low-frequency emission to higher frequency
observations to understand the environmental and shock acceleration conditions
that have given rise to the observed properties of this source. We present a
LOFAR High Band Antenna map centred at 143 MHz of the region of the Galactic
plane centred at $l = 166^\rm{o}, b = 3.5^\rm{o}$ at 143 MHz, with a resolution
of 148'' and an rms noise of 4.4 mJy bm$^{-1}$ . Our map is sensitive to scales
as large as $6^\rm{o}$. We compared the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) observations
to archival higher frequency radio, infrared, and optical data to study the
emission properties of the source in different spectral regimes. We did this
both for the SNR and for OA 184, an H II region within our field of view. We
find that the radio spectral index of VRO 42.05.01 increases at low radio
frequencies; i.e. the LOFAR flux is higher than expected from the measured
spectral index value at higher radio frequencies. This observed curvature in
the low-frequency end of the radio spectrum occurs primarily in the brightest
regions of the source, while the fainter regions present a roughly constant
power-law behaviour between 143 MHz and 2695 MHz. We favour an explanation for
this steepening whereby radiative shocks have high compression ratios and
electrons of different energies probe different length scales across the
shocks, therefore sampling regions of different compression ratios.

from $Z=1$ to $92$ by solving the corresponding time-dependent Dirac equations
adopting the properly scaled laser parameters. Good agreement is found and thus
the approximate scaling relations are shown to capture the dominant effect of
the response of highly-charged ions to intense laser fields compared to the one
of atomic hydrogen. On the other hand, the remaining differences are shown to
allow for the identification and quantification of additional, purely
relativistic effects in light-matter interaction.

patterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that
attention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous
noun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We
conclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models
to incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest
that NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the
encoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we
reveal that the first few layers gradually learn to ""align"" source and target
tokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but

they are able to learn complex patterns that benefit the classification.
However, convolutional networks are computationally expensive and require a
considerable amount of memory, which limits their deployment on low-power and

proposed pruning strategies that find and remove unimportant neurons (i.e.,
filters) in these networks. Despite achieving remarkable results, existing
pruning approaches are ineffective since the accuracy of the original network
is degraded. In this work, we propose a novel approach to efficiently remove
filters from convolutional networks. Our approach estimates the filter
importance based on its relationship with the class label on a low-dimensional

Variable Importance in Projection (VIP). Our method is able to reduce up to 67%

accuracy. With a negligible drop in accuracy, we can reduce up to 90% of FLOPs.
Additionally, sometimes the method is even able to improve the accuracy

criterion for detecting the filters to be removed is better than recent feature
selection techniques, which have been employed by state-of-the-art pruning

Experimental evidence is provided showing a gradual change in the nature of the

three types of matrices: the lattice distortion matrix, the orientation
relationship matrix, and the correspondence matrix. The paper gives some
formula to express them in crystallographic bases, orthonormal bases, and
reciprocal bases, and it explains how to use them to deduce the matrices of
inverse transformation. In the case of hard-sphere assumption, a continuous
form of the distortion matrix can be determined, and its derivative is
identified to the velocity gradient used in continuum mechanics. The
distortion, the orientation and the correspondence variants are determined by
coset decomposition with intersection groups that depend on the point groups of
the phases and on the type of transformation matrix. The stretch variants
required in the phenomenological theory of martensitic transformation should be
distinguished from the correspondence variants. The orientation variants and
the correspondence variants are also different; they are defined from the
geometric symmetries and algebraic symmetries, respectively. The concept of
orientation (ir)reversibility during thermal cycling is briefly and partially
treated by generalizing the orientation variants with n-cosets and graphs. Some
simple examples are given to show that there is no general relation between the
numbers of distortion, orientation and correspondence variants, and to
illustrate the concept of orientation variants formed by thermal cycling.

stable relative to each other which presents difficulties in realizing the
quantum memory. Here we propose a quantum memory using an intra-atomic
frequency comb which does not require frequency stabilization. We show that the
transitions between two degenerate energy levels of a single atom can be used
to construct the frequency comb. The spacing between the teeth of the comb is
controlled by applying an external magnetic field. Since the frequency comb is
constructed from individual atoms, these atoms can be used alone or in
ensembles to realize the quantum memory. Furthermore, the ensemble based
quantum memory with intra-AFC is robust against Doppler broadening which makes
it useful for high-temperature quantum memory. As an example, we numerically
show the intra-AFC in cesium atoms and demonstrate a photon echo which is
essential for quantum memory.

galaxies in the epoch of reionization. However, the origin of their radiative
properties has not been understood yet. Combining cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we present predictions of
multi-wavelength radiative properties of the first galaxies at $z\sim 6-15$.
Using zoom-in initial conditions, we investigate three massive galaxies and
their satellites in different environment and halo masses: $M_{\rm h} =
2.4\times 10^{10}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ (Halo-10), $1.6\times 10^{11}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
(Halo-11) and $0.7\times 10^{12}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ (Halo-12) at $z=6$. We find
that most of gas and dust are ejected from star-forming regions by supernova
feedback, which allows UV photons to escape. We show that the peak of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) rapidly changes between UV and infrared
wavelengths on a time-scale of $\sim$\,100\,Myrs due to intermittent star
formation and feedback, and the escape fraction of UV photons fluctuates in the
range of $0.2-0.8$ at $z<10$ with a time-averaged value of 0.3. When dusty gas
covers the star-forming regions, the galaxies become bright in the
observed-frame sub-millimeter wavelengths. We predict the detectability of
high-$z$ galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). For a
sensitivity limit of $0.1\,{\rm mJy}$ at $850\,{\rm \mu m}$, the detection
probability of galaxies in halos $M_{\rm h} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$
at $z\lesssim 7$ exceeds fifty per cent. We argue that supernova feedback can
produce the observed diversity of SEDs for high-$z$ galaxies.

activity of 50+ neurons in C. elegans, and analyze the data by building the
maximum entropy model that matches the mean activity and pairwise correlations
among these neurons. To capture the graded nature of the cells' responses, we
assign each cell multiple states. These models, which are equivalent to a
family of Potts glasses, successfully predict higher statistical structure in
the network. In addition, these models exhibit signatures of collective
behavior: the state of single cells can be predicted from the state of the rest
of the network; the network, despite being sparse in a way similar to the
structural connectome, distributes its response globally when locally
perturbed; the distribution over network states has multiple local maxima, as
in models for memory; and the parameters that describe the real network are
close to a critical surface in this family of models.

which disentangles the jammed state, resulting in an ordered, oriented skyrmion

and again yields an ordered, oriented skyrmion lattice, despite relatively
non-interacting nature of the grains. Micromagnetic simulations confirm the
promotion of a preferred skyrmion lattice orientation after field treatment,
independent of the initial configuration, suggesting this effect may be
universally applicable. Energetics extracted from the simulations suggest that
approaching a magnetic hard axis causes the moments to diverge away from the
magnetic field, increasing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya energy, followed
subsequently by a lattice re-orientation. The ability to facilitate an emergent
ordered magnetic lattice with long-range orientation in a variety of materials

heterogeneous with respect to the dispersal ability of individuals, and the
saturation factor is non-local with respect to one variable. We prove that the
rate of acceleration is slower than the rate of acceleration predicted by the
linear problem, that is, without saturation. This hindering phenomenon is the
consequence of a subtle interplay between the non-local saturation and the
non-trivial dynamics of some particular curves that carry the mass at the
front. A careful analysis of these trajectories allows us to identify the value
of the rate of acceleration. The article is complemented with numerical
simulations that illustrate some behavior of the model that is beyond our
analysis.

the multiscale structure of center clusters. In the confined phase, the data in
the three domains show the same topological tendency characterized by the birth

alpha complexes in the data space, but do not in the deconfined phase. By
considering the configuration averaged ratio of the birth and death times of

calculating SHC based on maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF). The
quantities needed by the Kubo formula of SHC are derived in the space of MLWF
and it is shown that only the Hamiltonian, the overlap and the spin operator
matrices are required from the initial \textit{ab-initio} calculation. The
computation of these matrices and the interpolation of Kubo formula on a dense
k-point mesh can be easily achieved. We validate our results by prototypical
calculations on fcc Pt and GaAs, which demonstrate that the Wannier
interpolation approach is of high accuracy and efficiency. Calculations of
$\alpha$-Ta and $\beta$-Ta show that SHC of $\beta$-Ta is 2.7 times of
$\alpha$-Ta, while both have the opposite sign relative to fcc Pt and are an
order of magnitude smaller than Pt. The calculated spin Hall angle of $-0.156$,
is quite consistent with previous experiment on $\beta$-Ta, further suggesting
intrinsic contribution may dominate in $\beta$-Ta. Our approach could
facilitate large-scale SHC calculations, and may benefit the discovery of

magnetic fields and the Earth's gravitational field. Field-trapping mitigates
the problem of UCN loss on material surfaces, which caused the largest
correction in prior neutron experiments using material bottles. However, the
neutron dynamics in field traps differ qualitatively from those in material
bottles. In the latter case, neutrons bounce off material surfaces with
significant diffusivity and the population quickly reaches a static spatial
distribution with a density gradient induced by the gravitational potential. In
contrast, the field-confined UCN -- whose dynamics can be described by
Hamiltonian mechanics -- do not exhibit the stochastic behaviors typical of an
ideal gas model as observed in material bottles. In this report, we will
describe our efforts to simulate UCN trapping in the UCN{\tau}

experimental results to determine the parameters of the neutron detector and
the input neutron distribution. The tuned model is then used to understand the
phase space evolution of neutrons observed in the UCN{\tau} experiment. We will
discuss the implications of chaotic dynamics on controlling the systematic

where the original continuous-time channel is converted to an equivalent
discrete-time channel, to which a great variety of established tools and

that continuous-time feedback cannot be incorporated into the channel model. It
turns out that this issue can be circumvented by considering the Brownian

as opposed to the white Gaussian noise formulation, a link that establishes the
information-theoretic connection between a continuous-time white Gaussian

establishing information-theoretic extensions of the Shannon-Nyquist theorem,
which naturally yield causality-preserving connections between continuous-time

because it is the primary transport mechanism for heat and chemical species and
the primary energy source for planetary magnetic fields. Key properties of
convection, such as the characteristic flow velocity and lengthscale, are
poorly quantified in planetary cores due to their strong dependence on
planetary rotation, buoyancy driving and magnetic fields, which are all
difficult to model under realistic conditions. In the absence of strong
magnetic fields, the core convective flows are expected to be in a regime of
rapidly-rotating turbulence, which remains largely unexplored to date. Here we
use a combination of numerical models designed to explore this low-viscosity
regime to show that the convective lengthscale becomes independent of the
viscosity and is entirely determined by the flow velocity and planetary
rotation. For the Earth's core, we find that the characteristic con-vective
lengthscale is approximately 30km and below this scale, motions are very weak.
The 30-km cutoff scale rules out small-scale dynamo action and supports
large-eddy simulations of core dynamics. Furthermore, it implies that our
understanding of magnetic reversals from numerical geodynamo models does not
relate to the Earth, because they require too intense flows. Our results also
indicate that the liquid core of the Moon might still be in an active
convective state despite the absence of a present-day dynamo.

widely studied but still challenging problem. The recent progresses obtained by
deep neural architectures, or by ensembles of heterogeneous models, have shown
that integrating multiple input representations leads to state-of-the-art
results. In particular, the appearance and the shape of the input face, or the
representations of some face parts, are commonly used to boost the quality of
the recognizer. This paper investigates the application of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with the aim of building a versatile recognizer of expressions
in static images that can be further applied to video sequences. We first study
the importance of different face parts in the recognition task, focussing on
appearance and shape-related features. Then we cast the learning problem in the
Semi-Supervised setting, exploiting video data, where only a few frames are
supervised. The unsupervised portion of the training data is used to enforce
three types of coherence, namely temporal coherence, coherence among the
predictions on the face parts and coherence between appearance and shape-based
representation. Our experimental analysis shows that coherence constraints can
improve the quality of the expression recognizer, thus offering a suitable
basis to profitably exploit unsupervised video sequences. Finally we present
some examples with occlusions where the shape-based predictor performs better
than the appearance one.

that single-layer fully-connected autoencoders project data onto the

to the training examples. Finally, we prove that depth is necessary and provide
empirical evidence that it is also sufficient for memorization in convolutional

the Jacobi elliptic functions. In the attractive region of the potential the
system becomes an anharmonic damped oscillator, however with asymmetric
displacement. An expression for the period of oscillation is derived, which for
a nonlinear damped system is time dependent, and in particular it contains a
quartic root of an exponentially decaying term in the denominator. Initially
the period is longer as compared to that of a linear oscillator, however
gradually it decreases to that of a linear damped oscillator.
  Transforming the undamped nonlinear differential equation into the
differential equation describing orbital motion of planets, the perihelion
advance of Mercury can be estimated to 42.98 arcseconds/century, close to
present day observations of 43.1 arcseconds/century.

however, they are standard functions of advanced mathematical computer algebra
tools. The expression derived for the solution to the nonlinear physical

large volumes of text data on microblogging platforms such as Twitter. These
corpora are untapped resources to understand social expressions on diverse
subjects. Microblog analysis aims to unlock the value of such expressions by
discovering insights and events of significance hidden among swathes of text.
Besides velocity; diversity of content, brevity, absence of structure and
time-sensitivity are key challenges in microblog analysis. In this paper, we
propose an unsupervised incremental machine learning and event detection
technique to address these challenges. The proposed technique separates a
microblog discussion into topics to address the key problem of diversity. It
maintains a record of the evolution of each topic over time. Brevity,
time-sensitivity and unstructured nature are addressed by these individual
topic pathways which contribute to generate a temporal, topic-driven structure
of a microblog discussion. The proposed event detection method continuously
monitors these topic pathways using multiple domain-independent event
indicators for events of significance. The autonomous nature of topic
separation, topic pathway generation, new topic identification and event
detection, appropriates the proposed technique for extensive applications in
microblog analysis. We demonstrate these capabilities on tweets containing
#microsoft and tweets containing #obama.
