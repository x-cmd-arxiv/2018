attacks on the run-time code by periodically refreshing the system with an
uncorrupted software image. The system is vulnerable to attacks when it is
communicating with other agents. Security is guaranteed during the software
refresh and re-initialization by turning off all communication. Although the
effectiveness of software rejuvenation has been demonstrated for some simple
systems, many problems need to be addressed to make it viable for real
applications. This paper expands the scope of CPS applications for which
software rejuvenation can be implemented by introducing architectural and
algorithmic features to support trajectory tracking. Following each software
refresh, while communication is still off, a safety controller is executed to
assure the system state is within a sufficiently small neighborhood of the
current point on the reference trajectory. Communication is then re-established
and the reference trajectory tracking control is resumed. A protected, verified
hypervisor manages the software rejuvenation sequence and delivers trusted
reference trajectory points, which may be received from untrusted
communication, but are verified using an authentication process. We present the
approach to designing the tracking and safety controllers and timing parameters

safety controller assures the CPS is driven to a safe state before returning to
the mission control mode when the CPS is again vulnerable attacks. This paper
considers software rejuvenation design from a control-theoretic perspective.
Invariant sets for the Lyapunov function for the safety controller are used to
derive bounds on the time that the CPS can operate in mission control mode
before the software must be refreshed and the maximum time the safety
controller will require to bring the CPS to a safe operating state. With these
results it can be guaranteed that the CPS will remain safe under cyber attacks

for thousands of classical and type II cepheids. We aim at reviewing the
classification of {\it Gaia} DR2 Cepheids and to derive precise PL/PW for
Magellanic Cloud (MCs) and Galactic Cepheids. Information from the literature
and the {\it Gaia} astrometry and photometry are adopted to assign DR2 Galactic
Cepheids to the classes: Classical, Anomalous and Type II Cepheids. We
re-classify the DR2 Galactic Cepheids and derive new precise PL/PW relations in
the {\it Gaia} passbands for the MCs and Milky Way Cepheids. We investigated
for the first time the dependence on metallicity of the $PW$ relation for
Classical Cepheids in the {\it Gaia} bands, finding non-conclusive results.
According to our analysis, the zero point of the {\it Gaia} DR2 parallaxes as
estimated from Classical and Type II Cepheids seems to be likely underestimated
by $\sim$0.07 mas, in full agreement with recent literature. The next {\it
Gaia} data releases are expected to fix this zero point offset to eventually
allow a determination of $\rm H_0$ to less than 1\%.

and estimating local, regional, and global RSL trends requires statistical
analysis of RSL data. Formal statistical treatments, needed to account for the
spatially and temporally sparse distribution of data and for geochronological
and elevational uncertainties, have advanced considerably over the last decade.
Time-series models have adopted more flexible and physically-informed
specifications with more rigorous quantification of uncertainties.
Spatio-temporal models have evolved from simple regional averaging to
frameworks that more richly represent the correlation structure of RSL across
space and time. More complex statistical approaches enable rigorous
quantification of spatial and temporal variability, the combination of
geographically disparate data, and the separation of the RSL field into various
components associated with different driving processes. We review the range of
statistical modeling and analysis choices used in the literature, reformulating
them for ease of comparison in a common hierarchical statistical framework. The
hierarchical framework separates each model into different levels, clearly
partitioning measurement and inferential uncertainty from process variability.
Placing models in a hierarchical framework enables us to highlight both the
similarities and differences among modeling and analysis choices. We illustrate
the implications of some modeling and analysis choices currently used in the
literature by comparing the results of their application to common datasets
within a hierarchical framework. In light of the complex patterns of spatial
and temporal variability exhibited by RSL, we recommend non-parametric
approaches for modeling temporal and spatio-temporal RSL.

health trajectories and understanding disease dynamics. Existing models are
capable of providing either accurate predictions of patients prognoses or
clinically interpretable representations of disease pathophysiology, but not
both. In this paper, we develop the phased attentive state space (PASS) model
of disease progression, a deep probabilistic model that captures complex
representations for disease progression while maintaining clinical
interpretability. Unlike Markovian state space models which assume memoryless
dynamics, PASS uses an attention mechanism to induce ""memoryful"" state
transitions, whereby repeatedly updated attention weights are used to focus on
past state realizations that best predict future states. This gives rise to
complex, non-stationary state dynamics that remain interpretable through the
generated attention weights, which designate the relationships between the
realized state variables for individual patients. PASS uses phased LSTM units
(with time gates controlled by parametrized oscillations) to generate the
attention weights in continuous time, which enables handling
irregularly-sampled and potentially missing medical observations. Experiments
on data from a realworld cohort of patients show that PASS successfully
balances the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability: it demonstrates
superior predictive accuracy and learns insightful individual-level
representations of disease progression.

neutron star. The wave energy can (1) dissipate in the magnetosphere, (2)
convert to ""fast modes"" and possibly escape, and (3) penetrate the neutron star
crust and dissipate there. We examine and compare the three options.
Particularly challenging are nonlinear interactions between strong waves, which
develop a cascade to small dissipative scales. This process can be studied in
the framework of force-free electrodynamics (FFE). We perform three-dimensional
FFE simulations to investigate Alfv\'{e}n wave dissipation, how long it takes,
and how it depends on the initial wave amplitude on the driving scale. In the
simulations, we launch two large Alfv\'{e}n wave packets that keep bouncing on
closed magnetic field lines and collide repeatedly until the full turbulence
spectrum develops. Besides dissipation due to the turbulent cascade, we find
that in some simulations spurious energy losses occur immediately in the first
collisions. This effect occurs in special cases where the FFE description
breaks. It is explained with a simple one-dimensional model, which we examine
in both FFE and full magnetohydrodynamic settings. We find that magnetospheric
dissipation through nonlinear wave interactions is relatively slow and more
energy is drained into the neutron star. The wave energy deposited into the
star is promptly dissipated through plastic crustal flows induced at the bottom
of the liquid ocean, and a fraction of the generated heat is radiated from the
stellar surface.

first setup is based on Gaussian processes, where the covariates are either

thick-tailed. As in the previous studies regarding the same problems, we do not
assume that the truth lies in the postulated parameter space, thus explicitly
allowing the possibilities of misspecification. We exploit the general results
of Shalizi (2009) for our purpose and establish not only posterior consistency,
but also the rates at which the posterior probabilities converge, which turns
out to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence rate. We also investigate the more
familiar posterior convergence rates. Interestingly, we show that the posterior
predictive distribution can accurately approximate the best possible predictive
distribution in the sense that the Hellinger distance, as well as the total

effects of deep-sleep-like slow oscillation activity on a simplified
thalamo-cortical model which is trained to encode, retrieve and classify images

spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) produces a differential homeostatic
process. It is characterized by both a specific unsupervised enhancement of
connections among groups of neurons associated to instances of the same class
(digit) and a simultaneous down-regulation of stronger synapses created by the
training. This hierarchical organization of post-sleep internal representations
favours higher performances in retrieval and classification tasks. The
mechanism is based on the interaction between top-down cortico-thalamic
predictions and bottom-up thalamo-cortical projections during deep-sleep-like
slow oscillations. Indeed, when learned patterns are replayed during sleep,
cortico-thalamo-cortical connections favour the activation of other neurons
coding for similar thalamic inputs, promoting their association. Such mechanism
hints at possible applications to artificial learning systems.

near-term implementation on quantum computers. In these algorithms, a quantum
computer evaluates the cost of a gate sequence (with speedup over classical
cost evaluation), and a classical computer uses this information to adjust the
parameters of the gate sequence. Here we present such an algorithm for quantum
state diagonalization. State diagonalization has applications in condensed
matter physics (e.g., entanglement spectroscopy) as well as in machine learning
(e.g., principal component analysis). For a quantum state $\rho$ and gate
sequence $U$, our cost function quantifies how far $ U\rho U^{\dagger}$ is from
being diagonal. We introduce novel short-depth quantum circuits to quantify our
cost. Minimizing this cost returns a gate sequence that approximately
diagonalizes $\rho$. One can then read out approximations of the largest
eigenvalues, and the associated eigenvectors, of $\rho$. As a
proof-of-principle, we implement our algorithm on Rigetti's quantum computer to
diagonalize one-qubit states and on a simulator to find the entanglement

Almgren Jr. in \cite[Section 5.11]{Federer74} to illustrate the need of certain
definitions in the calculus of variations.
  The Almgren-Federer example, besides its intended goal of illustrating subtle
aspects of geometric measure theory, is also a problem in the theory of
geodesics. Hence, we wrote an exposition of the beautiful ideas of Almgren and
Federer from the point of view of geodesics.
  In the language of geodesics, Almgren-Federer example constructs metrics in
$\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^2$, with the property that none of the Tonelli
geodesics (geodesics which minimize the length in a homotopy class) are Class-A
minimizers in the sense of Morse (any finite length segment in the universal
cover minimizes the length between the end points; this is also sometimes given
other names). In other words, even if a curve is a minimizer of length among
all the curves homotopic to it, by repeating it enough times, we get a closed
curve which does not minimize in its homotopy class.
  In that respect, the example is more dramatic than a better known example due
to Hedlund of a metric in $\mathbb{T}^3$ for which only 3 Tonelli minimizers
(and their multiples) are Class-A minimizers.
  For dynamics, the example also illustrates different definitions of
`integrable' and clarifies the relation between minimization and hyperbolicity
and its interaction with topology.

a complete understanding of mechanism. We propose a general approach for
characterizing path ensembles based on mapping individual trajectories into
pathway classes whose populations and uncertainties can be analyzed as an
ordinary histogram, providing a quantitative ""fingerprint"" of mechanism. In
contrast to prior flux-based analyses used for discrete-state models,
stochastic deviations from average behavior are explicitly included via direct

code, containing improved treatments of the thermal evolution of the gas and
the fragmentation of the feedback-driven shell. As part of this update, we have
produced new cooling and heating tables that account for the combined effects
of photoionization and collisional ionization on the cooling rate of the gas,
which we now make publically available. We employ our updated version of
WARPFIELD to investigate the impact of stellar feedback on GMCs with a broad
range of masses and surface densities and a variety of density profiles. We
show that the minimum star formation efficiency $\epsilon_{\mathrm{min}}$, i.e.
the star formation efficiency above which the cloud is destroyed by feedback
and further star formation is shut off, is mainly set by the average cloud
surface density. A star formation efficiency of 1-6 % is generally sufficient
to destroy a GMC. We also find star formation efficiencies per free-fall time
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 0.3$ %, in good agreement with recent
observations. Our results imply that stellar feedback alone is sufficient to
explain the low observed star formation efficiencies of GMCs. Finally, we show
that very massive clouds with steep density profiles - possible proxies of the
giant clumps observed in galaxies at $z \approx 2$ - are more resilient to
feedback than typical GMCs, with $\epsilon_{\mathrm{min}}$ between 1 and 12 %.

sequence of forming graph edges with the goal of maximizing the model score (a
function of accuracy, robustness and forward prediction quality). Thus
meta-modeling can be formulated as a Markov decision process with well-defined
states, actions, rules, objective functions, and rewards. By using neural
networks to estimate policies and state values, the computer agent is able to
efficiently self-improve the constitutive model it generated through
self-playing, in the same way AlphaGo Zero (the algorithm that outplayed the
world champion in the game of Go)improves its gameplay. Our numerical examples
show that this automated meta-modeling framework not only produces models which
outperform existing cohesive models on benchmark traction-separation data but
is also capable of detecting hidden mechanisms among micro-structural features
and incorporating them in constitutive models to improve the forward prediction
accuracy, which are difficult tasks to do manually.

matched to observations than galaxies at low and intermediate masses. Overall,
we find mismatches in $R_e$ (+), $\epsilon$ (-), $\sigma_e$ (-) and

sufficiently weak. Furthermore, the dynamics of the mid-plane in these

to the mid-plane, which shuts off the MRI. Instead, angular momentum transport
at the mid-plane is dominated by laminar magnetic fields, resulting in lower

alignment amplitude, the redshift evolving matter power spectrum, P(k,z), and
the co-moving distance, r(z). We find that lensing predominately constrains a
single global power spectrum amplitude and several co-moving distance bins. Our
approach can localise precise scales and redshifts where Lambda-Cold Dark
Matter (LCDM) fails -- if any. We find that below z = 0.4, the measured
co-moving distance r (z) is higher than that expected from the Planck LCDM
cosmology by ~1.5 sigma, while at higher redshifts, our reconstruction is fully
consistent. To validate our reconstruction, we compare LCDM parameter
constraints from the standard cosmic shear likelihood analysis to those found
by fitting to the non-parametric information and we find good agreement.

mock cluster catalogs. Each cluster is sampled from the mass function in a
fiducial cosmology and given an eROSITA count rate and redshift, where count
rates are modeled using the eROSITA effective area, a typical exposure time,
Poisson noise and the scatter and form of the observed X-ray luminosity-- and
temperature--mass--redshift relations. A subset of clusters have mock shear
profiles to mimic either those from DES and HSC or from the future Euclid and
LSST surveys. Using a count rate selection, we generate a baseline cluster
cosmology catalog that contains 13k clusters over 14,892~deg$^2$ of
extragalactic sky. Low mass groups are excluded using raised count rate
thresholds at low redshift. Forecast parameter uncertainties for
$\Omega_\mathrm{M}$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$ are 0.023 (0.016; 0.014), 0.017 (0.012;
0.010), and 0.085 (0.074; 0.071), respectively, when adopting DES+HSC WL
(Euclid; LSST), while marginalizing over the sum of the neutrino masses. A
degeneracy between the distance--redshift relation and the parameters of the
observable--mass scaling relation limits the impact of the WL calibration on
the $w$ constraints, but with BAO measurements from DESI an improved
determination of $w$ to 0.043 becomes possible. With Planck CMB priors,
$\Omega_\text{M}$ ($\sigma_8$) can be determined to $0.005$ ($0.007$), and the
summed neutrino mass limited to $\sum m_\nu < 0.241$ eV (at 95\%). If
systematics on the group mass scale can be controlled, the eROSITA group and

the virial radius, providing the largest galaxy sample in a single cluster at
$z > 2$ with CO(1-0) measurements. We find a large variety in the gas content
of these cluster galaxies, which is correlated with their relative positions
(or accretion states), with those closer to the cluster core being increasingly
gas-poor. Moreover, despite their low gas content, the galaxies in the cluster
center exhibit an elevated star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm gas}$)
compared to field galaxies, suggesting that the suppression on the SFR is
likely delayed compared to that on the gas content. Their gas depletion time is
around $t_{\rm dep} \sim 400$ Myrs, comparable to the cluster dynamical time.
This implies that they will likely consume all their gas within a single orbit
around the cluster center, and form a passive cluster core by $z\sim2$. This
result is one of the first direct pieces of evidence for the influence of
environment on the gas reservoirs and SFE of $z > 2$ cluster galaxies, thereby
providing new insights into the rapid formation and quenching of the most

advantage in detecting low-mass, old, and cold-start giant planets. We
emphasize proximity over youth in our target selection, probing physical
separations smaller than other direct imaging surveys. For FGK stars, LEECH
outperforms many previous studies, placing tighter constraints on the hot-start
planet occurrence frequency interior to $\sim20$ au. For less luminous,
cold-start planets, LEECH provides the best constraints on giant-planet
frequency interior to $\sim20$ au around FGK stars. Direct imaging survey
results depend sensitively on both the choice of evolutionary model (e.g., hot-
or cold-start) and assumptions (explicit or implicit) about the shape of the
underlying planet distribution, in particular its radial extent. Artificially
low limits on the planet occurrence frequency can be derived when the shape of
the planet distribution is assumed to extend to very large separations, well
beyond typical protoplanetary dust-disk radii ($\lesssim50$ au), and when
hot-start models are used exclusively. We place a conservative upper limit on
the planet occurrence frequency using cold-start models and planetary
population distributions that do not extend beyond typical protoplanetary
dust-disk radii. We find that $\lesssim90\%$ of FGK systems can host a 7 to 10
$M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ planet from 5 to 50 au. This limit leaves open the

The discussion includes various observations for nuclei: level densities,

rates can be derived from models of triaxial rigid rotation or cranking for a
given triaxiality parameters {\gamma}, but microscopic considerations are

were made by recently made Hartree- Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) calculations extended

various observations as reported in this overview demonstrate the importance of
allowing a breaking of axial symmetry for heavy nuclei already in the valley of

surprisingly many experimental data are well described globally without the
need for local fit parameters. In addition to these comparisons it will be
shown that it is advantageous to consider c{\gamma}=cos(3{\gamma}) an indicator

high critical fields. These recently-developed conductors were tested in a 31 T
magnet, and the results showed that their upper critical field (Bc2) values at
4.2 K are 27-28 T, and irreversible field (Birr) values are above 26 T, values
similar to or higher than those of best RRP conductors. The non-Cu Jc has been
brought to nearly 1200 A/mm2 at 16 T and 4.2 K, comparable to RRP, in spite of
the fact that the fine-grain Nb3Sn fractions in filaments are still low
(20-30%) and the grain sizes are still not fully refined (70-80 nm) due to
conductor designs and heat treatments that are not yet optimized. The Nb3Sn
layer Jc at 4.2 K, 16 T is 4710 A/mm2 for the APC wire with 1%Zr, about 2.5
times higher than RRP conductors, in spite of the fact that its grain size is
not yet fully refined due to insufficient oxygen and unoptimized heat
treatment. An analysis is presented about the non-Cu Jc that can be achieved by
further optimizing the APC conductors and their heat treatments.

the denoising of phase modulo-2p images from sinusoidal 2p-periodic and noisy

are to be preserved carefully, make InPhase denoising a challenging inverse
problem. We propose a novel two-step algorithm to tackle this problem by
exploiting the non-local self-similarity of the InPhase images. In the first
step, the patches of the phase images are modelled using Mixture of Gaussian
(MoG) densities in the complex domain. An Expectation Maximization(EM)
algorithm is formulated to learn the parameters of the MoG from the noisy data.
The learned MoG is used as a prior for estimating the InPhase images from the
noisy images using Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimation. In the second
step, an additional exploitation of non-local self-similarity is done by
performing a type of non-local mean filtering. Experiments conducted on

high-dimensional family questionnaire data (verbal autopsies) of a deceased
individual. CCVA algorithms are typically trained on non-local data, then used
to generate national and regional estimates of cause-specific mortality
fractions. These estimates may be inaccurate if the non-local training data is
different from the local population of interest. This problem is a special case
of transfer learning. However, most transfer learning classification approaches
are concerned with individual (e.g. a person's) classification within a target
domain (e.g. a particular population) with training performed in data from a
source domain. Epidemiologists are often more interested in estimating
population-level etiological distributions, using datasets much smaller than
those used in common transfer learning applications. We present a parsimonious
hierarchical Bayesian transfer learning framework to directly estimate
population-level class probabilities in a target domain. To address small
sample sizes, we introduce a novel shrinkage prior for the transfer error rates
guaranteeing that, in absence of any labeled target domain data or when the
baseline classifier has zero transfer error, the calibrated estimate of class
probabilities coincides with the naive estimates from the baseline classifier,
thereby subsuming the default practice as a special case. A novel Gibbs sampler
using data-augmentation enables fast implementation. We extend our approach to
use not one, but an ensemble of baseline classifiers. Theoretical and empirical
results demonstrate how the ensemble model favors the most accurate baseline
classifier. We present extensions allowing class probabilities to vary with
covariates, and an EM-algorithm-based MAP estimation. An R-package implementing
this method is developed.

rise significantly faster with temperature in models than on the lattice. In
the low-temperature and high baryon density regime, the two models predict
different states of matter; The PQM model predicts a confined and chirally

Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime to the free Schroedinger equation,
and the Einstein-massive-scalar system without a cosmological constant to the
Schroedinger-Newton (SN) equation. In this paper, motivated by the problem of
stability of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we examine how this limit is
affected by the presence of a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$.
Assuming for consistency that the product $\Lambda c^2$ tends to a negative

nonrelativistic limit is given by the SN system with an external harmonic
potential which we call the Schrodinger-Newton-Hooke (SNH) system. We then
derive the resonant approximation which captures the dynamics of small
amplitude spherically symmetric solutions of the SNH system. This resonant
system turns out to be much simpler than its general-relativistic version,
which makes it amenable to analytic methods. Specifically, in four spatial
dimensions, we show that the resonant system possesses a three-dimensional
invariant subspace on which the dynamics is completely integrable and hence can
be solved analytically. The evolution of the two-lowest-mode initial data (an
extensively studied case for the original general-relativistic system), in
particular, is described by this family of solutions.

Code (SpEC) utilizes a multi-domain pseudo-spectral method tightly adapted to
the geometry of the black holes; it is computationally efficient and accurate,
but--for high mass-ratios and large spins--sometimes requires manual
fine-tuning for the merger-phase of binaries. The Einstein Toolkit (ET) employs
finite difference methods and the moving puncture technique; it is less
computationally efficient, but highly robust.
  For some mergers with high mass ratio and large spins, the efficient
numerical algorithms used in SpEC have failed, whereas the simpler algorithms

microwave background, alter the ionization history of the universe, and
contribute to the diffuse photon flux. Constraints on new physics from such
considerations are typically derived for a single unstable particle species
with a single well-defined mass and characteristic lifetime. In this paper, by
contrast, we investigate the cosmological constraints on theories involving
entire ensembles of decaying particles --- ensembles which span potentially
broad ranges of masses and lifetimes. In addition to providing a detailed
numerical analysis of these constraints, we also formulate a set of simple
analytic approximations for these constraints which may be applied to generic
ensembles of unstable particles which decay into
electromagnetically-interacting final states. We then illustrate how these

physics of this behind-the-horizon region, whose ETW boundary geometry takes
the form of a closed FRW spacetime. We show that in many cases, this
behind-the-horizon physics can be probed directly by looking at the time
dependence of entanglement entropy for sufficiently large spatial CFT
subsystems. We study in particular states defined via Euclidean evolution from
conformal boundary states and give specific predictions for the behavior of the
entanglement entropy in this case. We perform analogous calculations for the
SYK model and find qualitative agreement with our expectations.
  A fascinating possibility is that for certain states, we might have gravity
localized to the ETW brane as in the Randall-Sundrum II scenario for cosmology.
In this case, the effective description of physics beyond the horizon could be
a big bang/big crunch cosmology of the same dimensionality as the CFT. In this
case, the d-dimensional CFT describing the black hole microstate would give a

propagation, in particular, providing exact marginals on acyclic graphs, but it

$\{\mathscr{P}(t)\}_{t \in [0,2\pi]}$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. $\mathscr{P}(t)$ is
a periodic Schr\""odinger operator $P_0$ perturbed by a dislocated potential.
This potential is periodic on the left and on the right, but acquires a phase
defect $t$ from $-\infty$ relative to $+\infty$. When $t=\pi$ and the
dislocation is small and adiabatic, Fefferman, Lee-Thorp and Weinstein showed
in previous work that Dirac points of $P_0$ (degeneracies in the band spectrum
of $P_0$) bifurcate to defect modes of $\mathscr{P}(\pi)$.
  We show that these modes are topologically protected at the level of the
family $\{\mathscr{P}(t)\}_{t \in [0,2\pi]}$. This means that local
perturbations cannot remove these states for all values of $t$, even outside
the small adiabatic regime studied by Fefferman$-$Lee-Thorp$-$Weinstein. We
define two topological quantities: an edge index (the signed number of
eigenvalues crossing an energy gap as $t$ runs from $0$ to $2\pi$) and a bulk
index (the Chern number of a Bloch eigenbundle for the periodic operator near
$+\infty$). We prove that these indexes are equal to the same odd winding
number. This shows the bulk-edge correspondence for the family
$\{\mathscr{P}(t)\}_{t \in [0,2\pi]}$. We express this winding number in terms

Weinstein manifold generate the Lagrangian cobordism infinity-category.
  As a geometric consequence, we see that any brane (after stabilization)
admits a Lagrangian cobordism to a disjoint union of some standard collection
of branes (cocores, linking disks, and a zero object). For example, when our
stopped Weinstein manifold is a point stopped by itself, we find that any exact
brane in Euclidean space admits a Lagrangian cobordism to a disjoint union of
cotangent fibers and a zero object. (This is a stronger statement than one
could obtain from purely Fukaya-categorical generation results.) Our methods
are constructive. For example, when our Weinstein manifold is a point, after
stabilization we can resolve the conormal to a compact manifold A of R^n by a
sequence of cotangent fibers; the resulting filtration realizes, after passage
to the wrapped Fukaya category, the Morse cochain complex of A associated to
(and hence filtered by) a generic ``distance to a point'' function; the
associated gradeds are the reduced homologies of the Morse attaching spheres.
  There is also an algebraic consequence. Lagrangian cobordism theory is
conjectured (in analogue to classical cobordism theory) to be linear over a
ring spectrum L controlling Lagrangian cobordisms between cotangent fibers in
Euclidean spaces. Our main theorem gives strong evidence for this conjecture:
The infinity-category of Lagrangians and their cobordisms in R^infinity is
equivalent to a full subcategory of modules over L.
  We conclude by proving a \pi_0-level theorem that gives further evidence of
the above conjecture: We exhibit a \pi_0-level symmetric monoidal structure
compatible with the linear structure of L-modules.

nearly-flat subbands derived from the lowest Landau level, in the presence of
quenched disorder and short-range interactions. We consider two models: a
suitably engineered periodic potential, and randomly distributed point-like
impurities. We perform numerical exact diagonalization on a torus geometry and
use the mean level spacing ratio $\langle r \rangle$ as a diagnostic of
ergodicity. For topological subbands, we find there is no ergodicity breaking
in both the one and two dimensional thermodynamic limits. For non-topological
subbands, in constrast, we find evidence of an ergodicity breaking transition
at finite disorder strength in the one-dimensional thermodynamic limit.
Intriguingly, indications of similar behavior in the two-dimensional
thermodynamic limit are found, as well. This constitutes a novel,
$\textit{continuum}$ setting for the study of the many-body localization
transition in one and two dimensions.

tool to probe the properties of the superconducting order parameter on a local

contacts created by means of atom manipulation, we demonstrate that in the
extreme case of a single transport channel through the atomic junction
modifications of the current-phase relation lead to significant deviations from
the linear AB formula relating the critical current to the involved gap

transmission, we model the Josephson effect in the dynamical Coulomb blockade

neglected. We find excellent agreement with the experimental data. Projecting
the current-phase relation onto the charge transfer operator shows that at high

non-negligible in Josephson-STM, for example, when scanning across single

In CBED, each CBED spot is in fact an in-line hologram of the sample, where
in-line holography is known to exhibit high intensity contrast in detection of
weak phase objects that are not detectable in conventional in-focus imaging
mode. Adsorbates exhibit strong intensity contrast in zero and higher order

noticeable intensity contrast only in the first and higher order CBED spots.

fraction of energy in commercial buildings. Hence, the use of optimization
techniques to reduce HVAC energy consumption has been widely studied. Model
predictive control (MPC) is one state of the art optimization technique for
HVAC control which converts the control problem to a sequence of optimization
problems, each over a finite time horizon. In a typical MPC, future system
state is estimated from a model using predictions of model inputs, such as
building occupancy and outside air temperature. Consequently, as prediction
accuracy deteriorates, MPC performance--in terms of occupant comfort and
building energy use--degrades. In this work, we use a custom-built building
thermal simulator to systematically investigate the impact of occupancy
prediction errors on occupant comfort and energy consumption. Our analysis
shows that in our test building, as occupancy prediction error increases from
5\% to 20\% the performance of an MPC-based HVAC controller becomes worse than
that of even a simple static schedule. However, when combined with a personal
environmental control (PEC) system, HVAC controllers are considerably more
robust to prediction errors. Thus, we quantify the effectiveness of PECs in
mitigating the impact of forecast errors on MPC control for HVAC systems.

The growth rates of the optimal perturbations grow linearly as the horizontal

scales is driven by extraction of potential energy from the mean flow, while at
small scales it is driven by extraction of kinetic energy from the mean shear.
We also analyze the effect of spatial discretization on the optimal

discretization on the Arakawa B grid generally has too-weak growth rates at
small scales and is less accurate than two second order discretizations on the

another that conserves both energy and enstrophy, yield very similar optimal
perturbation growth rates that are significantly more accurate than the B grid

the quenched approximation where the geometry is allowed to fluctuate but there
is no back-reaction from the matter on the geometry. By examining the
eigenvalue spectrum and the masses of scalar mesons we find evidence for a four
fold degeneracy in the fermion spectrum in the large volume, continuum limit.
It is natural to associate this degeneracy with the well known equivalence in
continuum flat space between the K\""ahler-Dirac fermion and four copies of a
Dirac fermion. Lattice effects then lift this degeneracy in a manner similar to
staggered fermions on regular lattices. The evidence that these discretization
effects vanish in the continuum limit suggests both that lattice continuum
K\""ahler-Dirac fermions are recovered at that point, and that this limit truly
corresponds to smooth continuum geometries. One additional advantage of the
K\""ahler-Dirac action is that it respects an exact $U(1)$ symmetry on any

symmetry. By examining fermion bilinear condensates we find strong evidence

However, the dynamic information has been proven to enhance the performance of
many graph analytic tasks such as community detection and link prediction.
Hence, it is necessary to design dedicated graph neural networks for dynamic
graphs. In this paper, we propose DGNN, a new {\bf D}ynamic {\bf G}raph {\bf
N}eural {\bf N}etwork model, which can model the dynamic information as the
graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework can keep updating node
information by capturing the sequential information of edges (interactions),
the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently.
Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework.

a specific set of bases: Legendre polynomials for potential vorticity and a
recombined Legendre basis from Shen (1994) for the streamfunction. The method
is tested in the context of linear baroclinic instability calculations, where
it is compared to the standard second-order finite-difference method and to a
Chebyshev collocation method. The Galerkin scheme is quite accurate even for a
small number of degrees of freedom $N$, and growth rates converge much more
quickly with increasing $N$ for the Galerkin scheme than for the
finite-difference scheme. The Galerkin scheme is at least as accurate as finite
differences and can in some cases achieve the same accuracy as the finite
difference scheme with ten times fewer degrees of freedom. The
energy-conserving Galerkin scheme is of comparable accuracy to the Chebyshev
collocation scheme in most linear stability calculations, but not in the Eady
problem where the Chebyshev scheme is significantly more accurate. Finally the
three methods are compared in the context of a simplified version of the
nonlinear equations: the two-surface model with zero potential vorticity. The
Chebyshev scheme is the most accurate, followed by the Galerkin scheme and then
the finite difference scheme. All three methods conserve energy with similar
accuracy, despite not having any a priori guarantee of energy conservation for
the Chebyshev scheme. Further nonlinear tests with non-zero potential vorticity
to assess the merits of the methods will be performed in a future work.

members for a number of applications. Endowing tailorable elasticity can have
wide ranging engineering ramification. Such tailorability could be possible
using some type of spatial gradation in the beam's material or cross section.
However, these often require extensive additive and subtractive material
processing or specialized casts. In this letter, we demonstrate an alternative
bio inspired mechanical pathway, which is based on exploiting the nonlinearity
that would arise from a functionally graded distribution of biomimetic scales
on the surface using an analytical approach. This functional gradation is
geometrically sourced and could arise from either spatial or angular gradation
of scales. We analyze such a functionally graded cantilever beam under uniform
loading. In comparison with uniformly distributed scales, we find significant
differences in bending stiffness for both spatial and angular gradations.
Spatial and angular functional gradation share some universality but also sharp
contrasts in their effect on the underlying beam. A combination of both types
of gradation in the structure can be used to alternatively increase or decrease
stiffness and therefore a pathway to tailor the elasticity of a cantilever beam
relatively easily. These results give rise to an architected framework for
designing and optimizing the topography of leveraged solids.

studied in the literature. For some time now, Work Stealing is one of the most
popular for scheduling such computations, and its performance has been studied
in both theory and practice. Although it delivers provably good performances,
the effectiveness of its underlying load balancing strategy is known to be
limited for certain classes of computations, particularly the ones exhibiting
irregular parallelism (e.g. depth first searches). Many studies have addressed
this limitation from a purely load balancing perspective, viewing computations
as sets of independent tasks, and then analyzing the expected amount of work
attached to each processor as the execution progresses. However, these studies
make strong assumptions regarding work generation which, despite being standard
from a queuing theory perspective --- where work generation can be assumed to
follow some random distribution --- do not match the reality of structured
parallel computations --- where the work generation is not random, only
depending on the structure of a computation.
  In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for studying the performance
of structured computation schedulers, define a criterion that is appropriate
for measuring their performance, and present a methodology for analyzing the
performance of randomized schedulers. We demonstrate the convenience of this
methodology by using it to prove that the performance of Work Stealing is

patterns reveals no information about the operations performed on it. Such data
structures were introduced by Wang et al. [ACM SIGSAC'14] and are intended for
situations where one wishes to store the data structure at an untrusted server.
One way to obtain an oblivious data structure is simply to run a classic data
structure on an oblivious RAM (ORAM). Until very recently, this resulted in an
overhead of $\omega(\lg n)$ for the most natural setting of parameters.
Moreover, a recent lower bound for ORAMs by Larsen and Nielsen [CRYPTO'18] show
that they always incur an overhead of at least $\Omega(\lg n)$ if used in a
black box manner. To circumvent the $\omega(\lg n)$ overhead, researchers have
instead studied classic data structure problems more directly and have obtained
efficient solutions for many such problems such as stacks, queues, deques,
priority queues and search trees. However, none of these data structures
process operations faster than $\Theta(\lg n)$, leaving open the question of
whether even faster solutions exist. In this paper, we rule out this
possibility by proving $\Omega(\lg n)$ lower bounds for oblivious stacks,

strong assumptions made by existing architectures and separate memories used
for modeling dialog context and KB results. Instead of using triples to store
KB results, we introduce a novel multi-level memory architecture consisting of
cells for each query and their corresponding results. The multi-level memory
first addresses queries, followed by results and finally each key-value pair
within a result. We conduct detailed experiments on three publicly available
task oriented dialog data sets and we find that our method conclusively
outperforms current state-of-the-art models. We report a 15-25% increase in
both entity F1 and BLEU scores.

particles with dynamics that are governed by both a damping term and a Magnus
term. The magnitude of the Magnus term has one value for half of the particles
and a different value for the other half of the particles. In the absence of a
driving force, the particles form a triangular lattice, while when a driving
force is applied, we find that there is a critical drive above which a
Magnus-induced disordering transition can occur even if the difference in the
Magnus term between the two particle species is as small as one percent. The
transition arises due to the different Hall angles of the two species, which
causes their motion to decouple at the critical drive. At higher drives, the
disordered state can undergo both species and density phase separation into a
density modulated stripe that is oriented perpendicular to the driving
direction. We observe several additional phases that occur as a function of
drive and Magnus force disparity, including a variety of density modulated
diagonal laned phases. In general we find a much richer variety of states
compared to systems of oppositely driven overdamped Yukawa particles. We
discuss the implications of our work for skyrmion systems, where we predict
that even for small skyrmion dispersities, a drive-induced disordering
transition can occur along with clustering phases and pattern forming states.

community to combat control hijacking attacks in the presence of memory
corruption vulnerabilities. The challenges in creating a practical CFI has
resulted in the development of a new type of CFI based on runtime type checking
(RTC). RTC-based CFI has been implemented in a number of recent practical
efforts such as GRSecurity Reuse Attack Protector (RAP) and LLVM-CFI. While
there has been a number of previous efforts that studied the strengths and
limitations of other types of CFI techniques, little has been done to evaluate
the RTC-based CFI. In this work, we study the effectiveness of RTC from the
security and practicality aspects. From the security perspective, we observe
that type collisions are abundant in sufficiently large code bases but
exploiting them to build a functional attack is not straightforward. Then we
show how an attacker can successfully bypass RTC techniques using a variant of
ROP attacks that respect type checking (called TROP) and also built two
proof-of-concept exploits, one against Nginx web server and the other against
Exim mail server. We also discuss practical challenges of implementing RTC. Our
findings suggest that while RTC is more practical for applying CFI to large
code bases, its policy is not strong enough when facing a motivated attacker.

strong Coulomb binding and small mass. Signatures of exciton condensation have
been reported in double quantum wells1-4, microcavities5, graphene6, and

Topological insulators (TIs) with massless particles and unique spin textures12

exciton condensation. Here we report experimental evidence of excitonic

to provide an informative physics-based prior on the environment's optimal
state-visitation distribution. Specifically, we present a new technique,
Learning with Planned Episodic Resets (LeaPER), that resets the environment's
state to one informed by the prior during the learning phase. We experimentally
show that LeaPER significantly outperforms traditional RL approaches by a
factor of up to 5X on simulated rearrangement. Further, we relax dynamics from
quasi-static to welded contacts to illustrate that LeaPER is robust to the use
of simpler physics models. Finally, LeaPER's closed-loop policies significantly
improve task success rates relative to both open-loop controls with a planned
path or simple feedback controllers that track open-loop trajectories. We

L_odot) QSOs with previous submillimetre continuum detections were followed up
with CO(3-2) observations using the NOEMA interferometer. All but two of the
QSOs are detected in CO(3-2); for one non-detection, our observations show a
tentative 2sigma line at the expected position and redshift, and for the other
non-detection we find only continuum flux density an order of magnitude
brighter than the other sources. In three of the fields, a companion
potentially suitable for tomography is detected in CO line emission within 25
arcsec of the QSO. We derive gas masses, dynamical masses and far-infrared
luminosities, and show that the QSOs in our sample have similar properties as
compared to less luminous QSOs and SMGs in the literature, despite the fact
that their black-hole masses (which are proportional to L_AGN) are 1-2 orders
of magnitude larger. We discuss two interpretations of these observations: this
is due to selection effects, such as preferential face-on viewing angles and
picking out objects in the tail ends of the scatter in host-galaxy mass and
black-hole mass relationships; or the black hole masses have been overestimated
because the accretion rates are super-Eddington.

humans perform this task, they are able to do it in a flexible and robust
manner, integrating modularly any novel visual capability with diverse options
for various elaborations of the task. In contrast, current approaches to solve
this problem by a machine are based on casting the problem as an end-to-end
learning problem, which lacks such abilities.
  We present a different approach, inspired by the aforementioned human
capabilities. The approach is based on the compositional structure of the
question. The underlying idea is that a question has an abstract representation
based on its structure, which is compositional in nature. The question can
consequently be answered by a composition of procedures corresponding to its
substructures. The basic elements of the representation are logical patterns,
which are put together to represent the question. These patterns include a
parametric representation for object classes, properties and relations. Each
basic pattern is mapped into a basic procedure that includes meaningful visual
tasks, and the patterns are composed to produce the overall answering
procedure.
  The UnCoRd (Understand Compose and Respond) system, based on this approach,
integrates existing detection and classification schemes for a set of object
classes, properties and relations. These schemes are incorporated in a modular
manner, providing elaborated answers and corrections for negative answers. In
addition, an external knowledge base is queried for required common-knowledge.
We performed a qualitative analysis of the system, which demonstrates its
representation capabilities and provide suggestions for future developments.

maximizing the value of ads they purchase in these auctions, subject to budget

devising a bidding strategy because of the uncertain resource consumption:
bidders win if they bid the highest amount, but pay the second-highest bid,
unknown a priori. This is in contrast to the traditional online knapsack
problem, where posted prices are revealed when ads arrive, and for which there
exists a rich literature of primal and dual algorithms.
  The main results of this paper establish general methods for adapting these
primal and dual online knapsack selection algorithms to the second-price
knapsack problem, where the prices are revealed only after bidding. In
particular, a methodology is provided for converting deterministic and
randomized knapsack selection algorithms into second-price knapsack bidding
strategies, that purchase ads through an equivalent set of criteria and thereby
achieve the same competitive guarantees. This shows a connection between the
traditional knapsack selection algorithm and second-price auction bidding
algorithms, that has not previously been leveraged.
  Empirical analysis on real ad exchange data verifies the usefulness of this

to use the approximate gradient given by performing truncated back-propagation
through the iterative optimization procedure that solves the lower-level

theoretical properties are still unclear. In this paper, we analyze the
properties of this family of approximate gradients and establish sufficient

particular, we find a new relaxation process related to the change of the
amplitude of internal magnetization within a wobbling triaxial grain and
identify a range of grain sizes in which this effect can dominate the internal
alignment of angular momentum within grain axes. We show that these relaxation
processes significantly change the dynamics of grains in the presence of RATs.
We apply our analysis for observed grain alignment in special environments to
put constraints on the enhanced magnetic properties of dust grains in the cloud
near supernovae, in cometary coma, and protoplanetary disks.

many pattern recognition and computer vision tasks. However, most of the CNN
structures are manually designed by experienced researchers. Therefore, auto-
matically building high performance networks becomes an important problem. In
this paper, we introduce the idea of using DNA computing algorithm to
automatically learn high-performance architectures. In DNA computing algorithm,
we use short DNA strands to represent layers and long DNA strands to represent
overall networks. We found that most of the learned models perform similarly,
and only those performing worse during the first runs of training will perform
worse finally than others. The indicates that: 1) Using DNA computing algorithm
to learn deep architectures is feasible; 2) Local minima should not be a
problem of deep networks; 3) We can use early stop to kill the models with the
bad performance just after several runs of training. In our experiments, an
accuracy 99.73% was obtained on the MNIST data set and an accuracy 95.10% was
obtained on the CIFAR-10 data set.

  Algorithms","Appear in NeurIPS 2019",,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  SARAH and SPIDER are two recently developed stochastic variance-reduced
algorithms, and SPIDER has been shown to achieve a near-optimal first-order
oracle complexity in smooth nonconvex optimization. However, SPIDER uses an
accuracy-dependent stepsize that slows down the convergence in practice, and
cannot handle objective functions that involve nonsmooth regularizers. In this
paper, we propose SpiderBoost as an improved scheme, which allows to use a much
larger constant-level stepsize while maintaining the same near-optimal oracle
complexity, and can be extended with proximal mapping to handle composite
optimization (which is nonsmooth and nonconvex) with provable convergence
guarantee. In particular, we show that proximal SpiderBoost achieves an oracle
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\min\{n^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2},\epsilon^{-3}\})$ in
composite nonconvex optimization, improving the state-of-the-art result by a
factor of $\mathcal{O}(\min\{n^{1/6},\epsilon^{-1/3}\})$. We further develop a
novel momentum scheme to accelerate SpiderBoost for composite optimization,
which achieves the near-optimal oracle complexity in theory and substantial
improvement in experiments.

proposed by Rosensweig (Rosensweig, Ferrohydrodynamics (1985)) for the dynamics
of ferrofluids. The system is expressed by the conservation of linear momentum,
the incompressibility condition, the conservation of angular momentum, and the
evolution of the magnetization. The existence proof is inspired by the
DiPerna-Lions theory of renormalized solutions. In addition, the rigorous
relaxation limit of the equations of ferrohydrodynamics towards the
quasi-equilibrium is investigated. The proof relies on the relative entropy
method, which involves constructing a suitable functional, analyzing its time
evolution and obtaining convergence results for the sequence of approximating
solutions.

neutrinos are signatures of such outflows. The detection of gravitational waves
and high-energy neutrinos from common sources could help establish the
connection between the dynamics of the progenitor and the properties of the
outflow. We searched for associated emission of gravitational waves and
high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical transients with minimal assumptions
using data from Advanced LIGO from its first observing run O1, and data from
the ANTARES and IceCube neutrino observatories from the same time period. We
focused on candidate events whose astrophysical origin could not be determined
from a single messenger. We found no significant coincident candidate, which we
used to constrain the rate density of astrophysical sources dependent on their
gravitational wave and neutrino emission processes.

All existing experiments are performed with the scale larger than angstrom. In

from the electromagnetic fields of relativistic heavy ions can fluctuate to
quark-antiquark pairs, scatter off a target nucleus and emerge as vector

of mobile devices have increased tremendously. However, in the big data era, to
complete tasks on one device is still challenging. As an emerging technology,
crowdsourcing utilizing crowds of devices to facilitate large scale sensing
tasks has gaining more and more research attention. Most of existing works
either assume devices are willing to cooperate utilizing centralized mechanisms
or design incentive algorithms using double auctions. Which is not practical to
deal with the case when there is a lack of centralized controller for the
former, and not suitable to the case when the seller device is also resource
constrained for the later. In this paper, we propose a truthful incentive
mechanism with combinatorial double auction for crowd sensing task assignment
in device-to-device (D2D) clouds, where a single mobile device with intensive
sensing task can hire a group of idle neighboring devices. With this new
mechanism, time critical sensing tasks can be handled in time with a
distributed nature. We prove that the proposed mechanism is truthful,
individual rational, budget balance and computational efficient. Our simulation
results demonstrate that combinatorial double auction mechanism gets a 26.3%
and 15.8% gains in comparison to existing double auction scheme and the
centralized maximum matching based algorithm respectively.

proof of this geometric result was given by A. de Medeiros, transforming the
endomorphism into a topological self-map with Lefschetz number not equal to
zero. We give a dual version of this proof, which may be more uniform, and does
not rely on the need to do any calculation of an Euler characteristic or
Lefschetz number. A vector field on Projective space is read off directly from
the coordinates (""entries"") of the given endomorphism (complex square matrix).
A bordism is defined between such vector fields by means of Stokes' Theorem
applied to a real manifold-with-boundary. This is the principle behind Hopf's
lemma relating the Gauss map and the index of a vector field. All vector fields
of the de Medeiros type are co-bordant to the Milnor-Hopf vector field. This
latter comes from a non-derogatory, real diagonal endomorphism, so clearly
possesses an eigen-vector. Therefore so has the given arbitrary endomorphism.
The main theorem on complex polynomials naturally follows, using the companion
matrix, secular polynomial reciprocity. The geometric Complex Axis derivation

The fitting results were used to determine the intensity ratio of D and G Raman

comparison to gasoline soot, which is revealed by the higher D/G intensity
ratio in Raman spectra measured under the same laser power.

both simultaneous (multi-task) as well as sequential transfer learning. In
several multi-task learning problems, despite using much fewer parameters than

  Disease Prediction Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent evidence has shown that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
an effective tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction and diagnosis. While
traditional MRI-based diagnosis uses images acquired at a single time point, a
longitudinal study is more sensitive and accurate in detecting early
pathological changes of the AD. Two main difficulties arise in longitudinal
MRI-based diagnosis: (1) the inconsistent longitudinal scans among subjects
(i.e., different scanning time and different total number of scans); (2) the
heterogeneous progressions of high-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) in
MRI. In this work, we propose a novel feature selection and estimation method
which can be applied to extract features from the heterogeneous longitudinal
MRI. A key ingredient of our method is the combination of smoothing splines and
the $l_1$-penalty. We perform experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The results corroborate the advantages
of the proposed method for AD prediction in longitudinal studies.

these years. It will be beneficial if we can learn an interpretable structure
from deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on Recurrent Neural
Networks~(RNNs) especially gated RNNs whose inner mechanism is still not
clearly understood. We find that Finite State Automaton~(FSA) that processes
sequential data has more interpretable inner mechanism according to the
definition of interpretability and can be learned from RNNs as the
interpretable structure. We propose two methods to learn FSA from RNN based on
two different clustering methods. With the learned FSA and via experiments on
artificial and real datasets, we find that FSA is more trustable than the RNN
from which it learned, which gives FSA a chance to substitute RNNs in
applications involving humans' lives or dangerous facilities. Besides, we
analyze how the number of gates affects the performance of RNN. Our result
suggests that gate in RNN is important but the less the better, which could be
a guidance to design other RNNs. Finally, we observe that the FSA learned from
RNN gives semantic aggregated states and its transition graph shows us a very
interesting vision of how RNNs intrinsically handle text classification tasks.

exponentially large high-dimensional but approximately low-rank dataset in
quantum parallel, by dimensionality reduction (DR) based on principal component

quantum machine learning can be released from the curse of dimensionality to

systematic information concerning both the sky and telescope, and displays as a
foreground-dominated `brick' and `wedge' on large line-of-sight scales, and a
complementary `window' on smaller scales. This paper builds on many previous
works in the literature which seek to elucidate the varied instrumental and
foreground factors which contribute to these familiar structures in the 2D
power spectrum. In particular, we consider the effects of $uv$-sampling on the
emergence of the wedge. Our results verify the expectation that arbitrarily
dense instrument layouts in principal restore the missing information that
leads to mode-mixing, and can therefore mitigate the wedge feature. We derive
rule-of-thumb estimates for the required baseline density for complete wedge
mitigation, showing that these will be unachievable in practice. We also
discuss the optimal shape of the layout, showing that logarithmic regularity in
the radial separation of baselines is favourable. While complete suppression of
foreground leakage into the wedge is practically unachievable, we find that
designing layouts which promote radial density and regularity is able to reduce

pulse can also generate coherent longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons in the form
of a strain pulse. The strain induces not only a periodic modulation in the

spike when it arrives at the GaP layer boundaries. The acoustic pulse induced
at the GaP/Si interface is remarkably stronger than that at the Si surface,
suggesting a possible application of the GaP/Si heterostructure as an
opto-acoustic transducer. The amplitude and the phase of the reflectivity

density profile exhibits a power-law decline with index $\Gamma=-2.37\pm0.17$,
matching that for the stellar halo component with [Fe/H] $<-1.1$. Spatial
density maps reveal a striking correspondence between the most luminous
substructures in the metal-poor field halo and the positions of many globular
clusters. By comparing the density of metal-poor halo stars local to each
cluster with the azimuthal distribution at commensurate radius, we reject the
possibility of no correlation between clusters and field overdensities with
high confidence. We use our stellar density measurements and previous kinematic
data to demonstrate that $\approx35-60\%$ of clusters exhibit properties
consistent with having been accreted into the outskirts of M31 at late times
with their parent dwarfs. Conversely, at least $\sim40\%$ of remote clusters
show no evidence for a link with halo substructure. The radial density profile
for this subgroup is featureless and closely mirrors that observed for the
apparently smooth component of the metal-poor stellar halo. We speculate that
these clusters are associated with the smooth halo; if so, their properties
appear consistent with a scenario where the smooth halo was built up at early
times via the destruction of primitive satellites. In this picture the entire
M31 globular cluster system outside $R_p=25$ kpc comprises objects accumulated
from external galaxies over a Hubble time of growth.

AT2018cow rose over a few days to a peak luminosity $L_{pk}\sim4\times 10^{44}$
erg/s exceeding those of superluminous supernovae (SNe), before declining as
$\propto t^{-2}$. Initial spectra at $\lesssim 15$ days were mostly featureless
and indicated large expansion velocities v~0.1c and temperatures reaching 30000
K. Later spectra revealed a persistent optically-thick photosphere and the
emergence of H and He emission features with v~sim 4000 km/s with no evidence
for ejecta cooling. Our broad-band monitoring revealed a hard X-ray spectral
component at $E\ge 10$ keV, in addition to luminous and highly variable soft
X-rays, with properties unprecedented among astronomical transients. An abrupt
change in the X-ray decay rate and variability appears to accompany the change
in optical spectral properties. AT2018cow showed bright radio emission
consistent with the interaction of a blastwave with $v_{sh}$~0.1c with a dense
environment ($\dot M\sim10^{-3}-10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ for $v_w=1000$
km\s). While these properties exclude Ni-powered transients, our
multi-wavelength analysis instead indicates that AT2018cow harbored a ""central
engine"", either a compact object (magnetar or black hole) or an embedded
internal shock produced by interaction with a compact, dense circumstellar
medium. The engine released $\sim10^{50}-10^{51.5}$ erg over $\sim10^3-10^5$ s
and resides within low-mass fast-moving material with equatorial-polar density
asymmetry ($M_{ej,fast}\lesssim0.3\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$). Successful SNe from
low-mass H-rich stars (like electron-capture SNe) or failed explosions from
blue supergiants satisfy these constraints. Intermediate-mass black-holes are
disfavored by the large environmental density probed by the radio observations.

galaxies remains an open question. M31, as the nearest massive normal galaxy,
holds promise for spatially-resolving the $\gamma$-ray emission. Based on more
than 8 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we use (1) disk, (2) bulge, and (3)
disk-plus-bulge templates to model the spatial distribution of the $\gamma$-ray
emission from M31. Among these, the disk-plus-bulge template delivers the
best-fit, in which the bulge component has a TS value 25.7 and a photon-index
of $2.57\pm0.17$, providing strong evidence for a centrally-concentrated
gamma-ray emission from M31, that is analogous to the Galactic center excess.
The total 0.2-300 GeV gamma-ray luminosity from this bulge component is
$(1.16\pm0.14)\times10^{38} erg s^{-1}$, which would require
$\sim1.5\times10^5$ millisecond pulsars, if they were the dominant source. We
also search for a Fermi bubble-like structure in M31 using the full dataset
(pass8), but no significant evidence is found. In addition, a likelihood
analysis using only photons with the most accurate reconstructed direction

$(0.97\pm0.27)\times10^{38} erg s^{-1}$ and a photon-index of $2.31\pm0.18$.
Lacking of a counterpart on the southeast side of the disk, the relation

prove that GBMM is superior to BBS in terms of SE and can break through the
well known `upper bound'. That is, GBMM renews the upper bound of the SE. We
investigate SE-oriented precoder activation probability optimization,
fully-digital precoder design, optimal power allocation and hybrid precoder
design for GBMM. A gradient ascent algorithm is developed to find the optimal
solution, which is applicable in all signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes. The
best solution is derived in the high SNR regime. Additionally, we investigate
the hybrid receiver design and deduce the minimum number of receive RF chains
configured to gain from GBMM in achievable SE. We propose a coding approach to
realize the optimized precoder activation. An extension to mmWave broadband
communications is also discussed. Comparisons with the benchmark (i.e., WF-MIMO
channel capacity) are made under different system configurations to show the
superiority of GBMM.

Plataniotis","Convolutional Deblurring for Natural Imaging","15 pages, for publication in IEEE Transaction Image Processing",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel design of image deblurring in the form of
one-shot convolution filtering that can directly convolve with naturally
blurred images for restoration. The problem of optical blurring is a common
disadvantage to many imaging applications that suffer from optical
imperfections. Despite numerous deconvolution methods that blindly estimate
blurring in either inclusive or exclusive forms, they are practically
challenging due to high computational cost and low image reconstruction
quality. Both conditions of high accuracy and high speed are prerequisites for
high-throughput imaging platforms in digital archiving. In such platforms,
deblurring is required after image acquisition before being stored, previewed,
or processed for high-level interpretation. Therefore, on-the-fly correction of
such images is important to avoid possible time delays, mitigate computational
expenses, and increase image perception quality. We bridge this gap by
synthesizing a deconvolution kernel as a linear combination of Finite Impulse
Response (FIR) even-derivative filters that can be directly convolved with
blurry input images to boost the frequency fall-off of the Point Spread
Function (PSF) associated with the optical blur. We employ a Gaussian low-pass
filter to decouple the image denoising problem for image edge deblurring.
Furthermore, we propose a blind approach to estimate the PSF statistics for two
Gaussian and Laplacian models that are common in many imaging pipelines.
Thorough experiments are designed to test and validate the efficiency of the
proposed method using 2054 naturally blurred images across six imaging
applications and seven state-of-the-art deconvolution methods.

and deletions while supporting queries for information such as connectivity.
There are many existing data structures for this problem, but few of them are
capable of exploiting parallelism in the batch-setting, in which large batches
of edges are inserted or deleted from the forest at once. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the Euler tour tree, an existing sequential dynamic trees data
structure, can be parallelized in the batch setting. For a batch of $k$ updates
over a forest of $n$ vertices, our parallel Euler tour trees perform $O(k \log
(1 + n/k))$ expected work with $O(\log n)$ depth with high probability. Our
work bound is asymptotically optimal, and we improve on the depth bound
achieved by Acar et al. for the batch-parallel dynamic trees problem.
  The main building block for parallelizing Euler tour trees is a
batch-parallel skip list data structure, which we believe may be of independent
interest. Euler tour trees require a sequence data structure capable of joins
and splits. Sequentially, balanced binary trees are used, but they are
difficult to join or split in parallel. We show that skip lists, on the other
hand, support batches of joins or splits of size $k$ over $n$ elements with
$O(k \log (1 + n/k))$ work in expectation and $O(\log n)$ depth with high
probability. We also achieve the same efficiency bounds for augmented skip
lists, which allows us to augment our Euler tour trees to support subtree
queries.
  Our data structures achieve between 67--96x self-relative speedup on 72 cores
with hyper-threading on large batch sizes. Our data structures also outperform
the fastest existing sequential dynamic trees data structures empirically.

eventually depins and the liquid film retracts on the ice. We measure and

nonclassicality of the states after storage becomes manifest as a negative

optical storage, on-demand release and synchronization of arbitrary single-rail

Both $N_u$ and $N_s$ are large numbers, and we consider the overloaded cases

on a fully-connected loopy factor graph, which is well understood to fail to
converge due to the correlation problem. In this paper, we utilize the
large-scale property of the system to simplify the convergence analysis of the
GMP under the overloaded condition. First, we prove that the \emph{variances}
of the GMP definitely converge to the mean square error (MSE) of Linear Minimum
Mean Square Error (LMMSE) multi-user detection. Secondly, the \emph{means} of
the traditional GMP will fail to converge when $ N_u/N_s<

convergent GMP called scale-and-add GMP (SA-GMP), which always converges to the
LMMSE multi-user detection performance for any $N_u/N_s>1$, and show that it
has a faster convergence speed than the traditional GMP with the same

Units (RUs) with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are considered to be both
power consumers and suppliers. Specifically, RUs with excessive renewable
generations can trade with the utility in deficit of power supplies for mutual
benefits. It causes two challenging issues. First, the trading data of RUs is
quite sensitive, which should be only accessed by authorized users with
fine-grained policies. Second, the behaviors of the RUs to generate trading
data are spontaneous and unpredictable, then the problem is how to guarantee
system efficiency and delay tolerance simultaneously. In this paper, we propose
a delay-tolerant flexible data access control scheme based on Key Policy
Attribute Based Encryption (KP-ABE) for Smart Grid with Renewable Energy

flexible access control with encryption delay tolerance. Furthermore, there is
no central trusted server to perform the encryption/decryption. We reduce the
computation cost on RUs and operators via a semi-trusted model. The analysis
shows that the proposed scheme can meet the data security requirement of the

the attacker only needs to register a set of fake accounts and link to existing

the classification accuracy on the target nodes. In addition, we introduce a
discriminator to classify malicious nodes from real nodes, and propose a
Greedy-GAN attack to simultaneously update the discriminator and the attacker,

by the trimaximal mixing realized using the NMSSM singlet S and only two flavon
fields. The phenomenology of neutrino parameters is studied for normal and
inverted mass hierarchies. In particular, we numerically evaluated the
observables related to neutrino masses and mixing, namely, $\sum m_{i}$,
$m_{ee}$, $m_{\nu_{e}}$, and $\delta_{CP}$ where we find that the ranges of

spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{A}_{4}\times \boldsymbol{Z}_{3}$ discrete

occur at high energy scale leading to unproblematic domain walls, while in the

the transmission line can be treated as multiple bad data. Subsequently a
linear observer theory is designed in order to identify the fault type and bad

particular failure mode manifest itself as residual which remains in a fixed
direction. Moreover coordinate transformation is performed to allow the
residual for each failure mode to generate specific geometry characteristic in

presented in this paper. The design allows 1) bad data detection for current
measurement, and 2) fault location, and fault resistance estimation (as a

resistance. However it loses freedom in designing the eigenvalues in the
excessive subspace. While the theoretical framework is general, the analysis

a district heating system where heat can be produced by CHP units or heat-only
units, e.g., gas or wood chip boilers. We use a mixed-integer linear program to
determine the optimal operation of the portfolio of production units and
storages on a daily basis. Based on the optimal production of subsets of units,
we can derive the bidding prices and amounts of electricity offered by the CHP
units for the day-ahead market. The novelty about our approach is that the
prices are derived by iteratively replacing the production of heat-only units
through CHP production. This results in an algorithm with a robust bidding
strategy that does not increase the system costs even if the bids are not won.
We analyze our method on a small realistic test case to illustrate our method
and compare it with other bidding strategies from literature, which consider
CHP units individually. The analysis shows that considering a portfolio of
units in a district heating system and determining bids based on replacement of
heat production of other units leads to better results.

than $\sim t^{-3/2}$. As part of the derivation, we also recover the
Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient of the dynamics.
The derived solution exhibits agreement with Langevin dynamics simulations when
(i) the periodic length is much larger than the ballistic length of the
dynamics, and (ii) when the potential barrier $\Delta U=\max(U(x))-\min(U(x))$
is not much larger than the thermal energy $k_BT$.

network, we find that the Possion's ratio decreases with the increase of
structural disorder and even becomes negative. Employing our finding that
longer springs tend to contribute more to the shear modulus but less to the
bulk modulus, we are able to achieve negative Poisson's ratio with lower
structural disorder by attributing each spring a length dependent stiffness.
Even with perfect crystalline structure, the network can have negative
Possion's ratio, if the stiffness of each spring is set by its virtual length

to fall in the range of 50 -- 2000 Jy ms, making FRB 110214 one of the
highest-fluence FRBs detected with the Parkes telescope. No repeating pulses
were seen in almost 100 hours of follow-up observations with the Parkes

operators can not only provide flexibility to the power system by acting on the
electricity market, but also profit from the situation to lower the overall

uncertain components at the time of planning: electricity prices as well as
heat and power production from RES. In this publication, we propose a planning
method that supports DH operators by scheduling the production and creating
bids for the day-ahead and balancing electricity markets. The method is based
on stochastic programming and extends bidding strategies for virtual power
plants to the DH application. The uncertain factors are considered explicitly
through scenario generation. We apply our solution approach to a real case
study in Denmark and perform an extensive analysis of the production and
trading behaviour of the DH system. The analysis provides insights on how DH

benefit in terms of cost reductions from considering a portfolio of units and
both markets to adapt to RES production and market states.

popular strategies for community detection, but many of them lack the
flexibility of resolution and thus are incompatible with multi-scale
communities of networks. Here, we further studied a statistical measure of
interest for community detection, asymptotic surprise, an asymptotic
approximation of surprise. We discussed the critical behaviors of asymptotic
surprise in phase transition of community partition theoretically. Then,
according to the theoretical analysis, a multi-resolution method based on
asymptotic surprise was introduced, which provides an alternative approach to
study multi-scale networks, and an improved Louvain algorithm was proposed to
optimize the asymptotic surprise more effectively. By a series of experimental
tests in various networks, we validated the critical behaviors of the
asymptotic surprise further and the effectiveness of the improved Louvain
algorithm, displayed its ability to solve the first-type resolution limit and
stronger tolerance against the second-type resolution limit, and confirmed its
effectiveness of revealing multi-scale community structures in multi-scale

Visual interactive learning (VIL) compared with computers can avoid semantic

groundbreaking way. In order to fully understand the importance of VIL to the
interaction process, we re-summarize the interactive learning related
algorithms (e.g. clustering, classification, retrieval etc.) from the

traditional computer labeling methods (such as label propagation) in both
accuracy and efficiency, which achieves significant classification results on

planetary perturbation in the light curve is a smooth bump, resulting in the
classical binary-lens/binary-source (2L1S/1L2S) degeneracy. We measure the V -
I color of the (putative) two sources in the 1L2S model, and then effectively
rule out the binary source solution. The finite-source effect is marginally
detected. Combined with the limits on the blend flux and the probability

Bayesian analysis yields the lens mass M_L = 0.45+0.33-0.28 M_sun, at distance
of D_L = 6.60+1.10-1.30 kpc. Thus the companion is a super-Jupiter of a mass

to reduce Non X-ray Background in the high energy band above 10\,keV
drastically by using anti-coincidence technique with active shield counters

necessary to make the dead layer on the X-ray incident surface as thin as
possible. Since XRPIX1b, which is a device at the initial stage of development,
is a front-illuminated (FI) type of XRPIX, low energy X-ray photons are
absorbed in the 8 $\rm \mu$m thick circuit layer, lowering the sensitivity in
the soft X-ray band. Therefore, we developed a back-illuminated (BI) device
XRPIX2b, and confirmed high detection efficiency down to 2.6 keV, below which
the efficiency is affected by the readout noise. In order to further improve
the detection efficiency in the soft X-ray band, we developed a

While most results in this domain have been achieved on image classification

in particular, semantic image segmentation using fully convolutional networks.
In contrast to the aforementioned areas, the design choices of a fully
convolutional network require several changes, ranging from the sort of
operations that need to be used---e.g., dilated convolutions---to a solving of
a more difficult optimisation problem. In this work, we are particularly
interested in searching for high-performance compact segmentation
architectures, able to run in real-time using limited resources. To achieve
that, we intentionally over-parameterise the architecture during the training
time via a set of auxiliary cells that provide an intermediate supervisory
signal and can be omitted during the evaluation phase. The design of the
auxiliary cell is emitted by a controller, a neural network with the fixed
structure trained using reinforcement learning. More crucially, we demonstrate
how to efficiently search for these architectures within limited time and
computational budgets. In particular, we rely on a progressive strategy that
terminates non-promising architectures from being further trained, and on
Polyak averaging coupled with knowledge distillation to speed-up the
convergence. Quantitatively, in 8 GPU-days our approach discovers a set of

$\rho(770)\pi G$ and $f_2(1270)\pi F$ decays. In addition to the ground state
resonance $a_1(1260)$, we have found evidence for the $a_1(1640)$. We also
study the spectrum of $\pi_2$ states by simultaneously describing four
$J^{PC}=2^{-+}$ waves using three $\pi_2$ resonances, the $\pi_2(1670)$, the
$\pi_2(1880)$, and the $\pi_2(2005)$.
  Using a novel analysis approach, where the resonance-model fit is performed
simultaneously in narrow bins of the squared four-momentum transfer $t'$
between the beam pion and the target proton, allows us to study the $t'$
dependence of resonant and non-resonant components included in our model. We
observe that for most of the partial waves, the non-resonant components show a
steeper $t'$ spectrum compared to the resonances and that the $t'$ spectrum of
most of the resonances becomes shallower with increasing resonance mass. We
also study the $t'$ dependence of the relative phases between resonance
components. The pattern we observe is consistent with a common production
mechanism of these states.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Verification of concurrent data structures is one of the most challenging
tasks in software verification. The topic has received considerable attention
over the course of the last decade. Nevertheless, human-driven techniques
remain cumbersome and notoriously difficult while automated approaches suffer
from limited applicability. The main obstacle for automation is the complexity
of concurrent data structures. This is particularly true in the absence of
garbage collection. The intricacy of lock-free memory management paired with
the complexity of concurrent data structures makes automated verification
prohibitive.
  In this work we present a method for verifying concurrent data structures and
their memory management separately. We suggest two simpler verification tasks
that imply the correctness of the data structure. The first task establishes an
over-approximation of the reclamation behavior of the memory management. The
second task exploits this over-approximation to verify the data structure
without the need to consider the implementation of the memory management
itself. To make the resulting verification tasks tractable for automated
techniques, we establish a second result. We show that a verification tool
needs to consider only executions where a single memory location is reused. We
implemented our approach and were able to verify linearizability of
Michael&Scott's queue and the DGLM queue for both hazard pointers and
epoch-based reclamation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
verify such implementations fully automatically.

We applied analysis methods to all the features in the same way in order to
investigate the reproducibility of the correlations among them, which may be
found from the combination of previous statistical studies. The samples of 211
M-class and X-class flares, which were observed between 2006 and 2015 by
Hinode/X-ray telescope, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph, and GOES, were examined statistically. Five kinds of
analysis were performed: Occurrence rate analysis, linear-correlation analysis,
association analysis, the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test, and Anderson-Darling test.
The analyses show three main results. First, the sigmoidal structure and long
duration events (LDEs) has stronger dependency on the CME occurrence than large
X-ray class events in on-disk events. Second, for the limb events, the
significant dependency exists between LDEs and CME occurrence, and between
X-ray class and CME occurrence. Third, there existed 32.4% of on-disk flare
events, which had sigmoidal structure and were not accompanied by CMEs.
However, the occurrence probability of CMEs without sigmoidal structures is
very small, 8.8 %, in on-disk events. While the first and second results are
consistent with previous studies, we newly provided the difference between the
on-disk events and limb events. The third result that non-sigmoidal regions
produce less eruptive events is also different from previous results. We
suggest that sigmoidal structures in soft X-ray images will be a helpful
feature for CME prediction regarding on-disk flare events.

$O(\sqrt{T}(1+P_T))$ dynamic regret, where $T$ is the number of iterations and
$P_T$ is the path-length of the comparator sequence. However, this result is
unsatisfactory, as there exists a large gap from the $\Omega(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$

novel online method, namely adaptive learning for dynamic environment (Ader),

is to maintain a set of experts, each attaining an optimal dynamic regret for a
specific path-length, and combines them with an expert-tracking algorithm.
Furthermore, we propose an improved Ader based on the surrogate loss, and in
this way the number of gradient evaluations per round is reduced from $O(\log

a gap size of {\Delta} = 26 cm-1, a scattering rate of 1/{\tau} = 360 cm-1 and

flares, perhaps most uniquely, on the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen at high
cadence and moderate spectral resolution. In this paper we concentrate on the
analysis of Lyman continuum (LyC) observations and its temporal evolution in a
sample of six major solar flares. By fitting both the pre-flare and flare
excess spectra with a blackbody function we show that the color temperature
derived from the slope of LyC reveals temperatures in excess of 10$^{4}$ K in
the six events studied; an increase of a few thousand Kelvin above quiet-Sun
values (typically $\sim$8000-9500 K). This was found to be as high as 17000 K
for the 2017 September 6 X9.3 flare. Using these temperature values, and
assuming a flaring area of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{2}$, estimates of the departure
coefficient of hydrogen, $b_1$, were calculated. It was found that $b_1$
decreased from 10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ in the quiet-Sun, to around unity during the
flares. This implies that LyC is optically thick and formed in local
thermodynamic equilibrium during flares. It also emanates from a relatively
thin ($\lesssim$100 km) shell formed at deeper, denser layers than in the
quiescent solar atmosphere. We show that in terms of temporal coverage and
resolution, EVE gives a more comprehensive picture of the response of the
chromosphere to the flare energy input with respect to those of the
Skylab/Harvard College Observatory spatially resolved observations of the
1970's.

users in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G cellular networks. In
particular, there are emerging UAV applications such as aerial photograph and
data relaying that require high-speed communications between the UAVs and the
ground base stations (GBSs). Due to the high UAV altitude, the strong
line-of-sight (LoS) links generally dominate the channels between the UAVs and
GBSs, which brings both opportunities and challenges in the design of future
wireless networks supporting both terrestrial and aerial users. Although each
UAV can associate with more GBSs for communication as compared to terrestrial
users thanks to the LoS-dominant channels, it also causes/suffers more severe
interference to/from the terrestrial communications in the uplink/downlink.
This paper studies the uplink communication from a multi-antenna UAV to a set
of GBSs within its signal coverage by considering a practical yet challenging
scenario when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller than that of
co-channel GBSs. To achieve high-rate transmission yet avoid interfering with
any of the existing terrestrial communications at the co-channel GBSs, we
propose a novel multi-beam transmission strategy by exploiting the
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the UAV sends
each data stream to a selected subset of the GBSs, which can decode the UAV's
signals and then cancel them before decoding the messages of their served
terrestrial users, and in the meanwhile nulls its interference at the other
GBSs via zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. To draw essential insight, we first
characterize in closed-form the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) under the proposed
strategy. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the UAV's
transmit rate subject to the interference avoidance constraints for protecting
the terrestrial users.

used to predict short-term price movements in stock markets. This paper
proposes a new neural network architecture for predicting return jump arrivals
in equity markets with high-frequency limit order book data. This new
architecture, based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory with Attention, is
introduced to apply time series representation learning with memory and to
focus the prediction attention on the most important features to improve
performance. The data set consists of order book data on five liquid U.S.
stocks. The use of the attention mechanism makes it possible to analyze the
importance of the inclusion limit order book data and other input variables. By
using this mechanism, we provide evidence that the use of limit order book data
was found to improve the performance of the proposed model in jump prediction,
either clearly or marginally, depending on the underlying stock. This suggests
that path-dependence in limit order book markets is a stock specific feature.
Moreover, we find that the proposed approach with an attention mechanism
outperforms the multi-layer perceptron network as well as the convolutional
neural network and Long Short-Term memory model.

modified version of the crossed-fields method. This approach to the preparation
of high-$n$ circular Rydberg states overcomes limitations of the standard
crossed-fields method which arise at this, and higher, values of $n$. The
experiments were performed with atoms traveling in pulsed supersonic beams that
were initially laser photoexcited from the metastable 1s2s$\,^3$S$_1$ level to
the 1s73s$\,^3$S$_1$ level by resonance-enhanced two-color two-photon
excitation in a magnetic field of 16.154 G. These excited atoms were then
polarized using a perpendicular electric field of 0.844~V/cm, and transferred
by a pulse of microwave radiation to the state that, when adiabatically
depolarized, evolves into the $n=70$ circular state in zero electric field. The
excited atoms were detected by state-selective electric field ionization. Each
step of the circular state preparation process was validated by comparison with
the calculated atomic energy level structure in the perpendicular electric and
magnetic fields used. Of the atoms initially excited to the 1s73s$\,^3$S$_1$
level, $\sim80$\% were transferred to the $n=70$ circular state. At these high
values of $n$, $\Delta n = 1$ circular-to-circular Rydberg state transitions
occur at frequencies below 20 GHz. Consequently, atoms in these states, and the
circular state preparation process presented here, are well suited to hybrid
cavity QED experiments with Rydberg atoms and superconducting microwave

decreasing the time between deliveries. Migration to microservices is one of
the most common situations when companies adopt continuous architecting
processes [4]. Companies commonly adopt an initial migration strategy to
extract some components from the monolithic system as microservices, making use
of simplified microservices patterns [5][4]. As an example, companies commonly
directly connect the microservices to the legacy monolithic system and do not
adopt any message bus at the beginning. When the system starts to grow in
complexity, they usually start re-architecting their systems, considering
different architectural patterns. Some companies introduce API gateway patterns
to simplify the management and load balancing of the different services, while
others also consider a lightweight message bus [4][5][6]. All these
architectural changes require deep refactoring of the system, thereby
increasing the risk of new faults being introduced. In this paper, we report
the preliminary results of work in progress, where we monitored the TD of an
SME (SMEs = small and medium enterprises) that adopted a CA approach while
migrating a legacy monolithic system to an ecosystem of microservices. To the
best of our knowledge, no studies exist on the impact of postponed activities
on the TD, especially in the context of CA and microservices. This work will
help companies understand how TD grows and changes over time while at the same
time opening up new avenues for future research on the analysis of TD interest

Particularly unusual states of matter can be created by light fields with
strengths comparable to the Coulomb field that binds valence electrons in
atoms, leading to nearly-free electrons oscillating in the laser field and yet
still loosely bound to the core [1,2]. These are known as Kramers-Henneberger
states [3], a specific example of laser-dressed states [2]. Here, we
demonstrate that these states arise not only in isolated atoms [4,5], but also
in rare gases, at and above atmospheric pressure, where they can act as a gain
medium during laser filamentation. Using shaped laser pulses, gain in these
states is achieved within just a few cycles of the guided field. The
corresponding lasing emission is a signature of population inversion in these
states and of their stability against ionization. Our work demonstrates that
these unusual states of neutral atoms can be exploited to create a general
ultrafast gain mechanism during laser filamentation.

eighth-order centered spatial differencing, the Partial Donor Cell Method

Gaussian quadrature techniques, high-order upwind reconstruction, non-clipping
options for interface values, and improved treatment of axis singularities. The

memory access patterns conducive to aligned vector operations and the

structural relaxation, and evolution of the potential energy in binary glasses

mixture with strongly non-additive cross interactions, which is annealed across
the glass transition with different cooling rates and then exposed to one
thousand thermal cycles at constant pressure. We found that during the first
few hundred transient cycles, the potential energy minima after eachcycle
gradually decrease and the structural relaxation proceeds via collective,
irreversible displacements of atoms. With increasing cycle number, the
amplitudes of the volume and potential energy oscillations are significantly
reduced, and the potential energy minima saturate to a constant value that
depends on the thermal amplitude and cooling rate. In the steady state, the
glasses thermally expand and contract but most of the atoms return to
theircages after each cycle, similar to limit cycles found in periodically
driven amorphous materials. The results of tensile tests demonstrate that the
elastic modulus and the yielding peak, evaluated after the thermal treatment,
acquire maximum values at a particular thermal amplitude, which coincides with
the minimum of the potential energy.

energetic electrons within the forward shock. By $\Delta t \approx20\,$days,
the X-ray emission shows spectral softening and erratic inter-day variability.

the central engine of the event. Regardless of the nature of this central

Because the best existing exact algorithm becomes numerically unstable for

approaches like approximate algorithms (Gibbs sampling, variational Bayes,
etc.), shrinkage priors (e.g. the Horseshoe prior and the Spike-and-Slab LASSO)
or empirical Bayesian methods. However, by introducing algorithmic ideas from
online sequential prediction, we show that exact calculations are feasible for
much larger sample sizes: for general model selection priors we reach n=25000,
and for certain spike-and-slab priors we can easily reach n=100000. We further
prove a de Finetti-like result for finite sample sizes that characterizes
exactly which model selection priors can be expressed as spike-and-slab priors.

demonstrated in experiments on simulated data, on a differential gene
expression data set, and to compare the effect of multiple hyper-parameter

that the proposed methods are numerically reliable whereas an alternative based

to develop an integrated text-independent speaker verification system that

approach using a teacher-student learning framework for this goal, applied to
short utterance compensation for the first time in our knowledge. The core
concept of the proposed system is to conduct the compensation throughout the
network that extracts the speaker embedding, mainly in phonetic-level, rather
than compensating via a separate system after extracting the speaker embedding.
In the proposed architecture, phonetic-level features where each feature
represents a segment of 130 ms are extracted using convolutional layers. A
layer of gated recurrent units extracts an utterance-level feature using
phonetic-level features. The proposed approach also adopts a new objective
function for teacher-student learning that considers both Kullback-Leibler
divergence of output layers and cosine distance of speaker embeddings layers.
Experiments were conducted using deep neural networks that take raw waveforms
as input, and output speaker embeddings on VoxCeleb1 dataset. The proposed
model could compensate approximately 65 \% of the performance degradation due
to the shortened duration.

multiple types of algae from different phyla groups by combining standard
morphological features with their multi-wavelength signals. Two phyla with
focused investigation in this study are the Cyanophyta phylum (blue-green
algae), and the Chlorophyta phylum (green algae). We use a custom-designed
microscopy imaging system which is configured to image water samples at two
fluorescent wavelengths and seven absorption wavelengths using
discrete-wavelength high-powered light emitting diodes (LEDs). Powered by
computer vision and machine learning, we investigate the possibility and
effectiveness of automatic classification using a deep residual convolutional
neural network. More specifically, a classification accuracy of 96% was
achieved in an experiment conducted with six different algae types. This high
level of accuracy was achieved using a deep residual convolutional neural
network that learns the optimal combination of spectral and morphological
features. These findings elude to the possibility of leveraging a unique
fingerprint of algae cell (i.e. spectral wavelengths and morphological
features) to automatically distinguish different algae types. Our work herein
demonstrates that, when coupled with multi-band fluorescence microscopy,
machine learning algorithms can potentially be used as a robust and

amplification produced by $Na^+$ influx instead of a $Cl^-$ efflux is
problematic due to several reasons: First, the $Na^+$ current amplitude varies
greatly depending on mucosal ion concentration changes. Second, a $Na^+$
current leads to a large increase in the ciliary $Na^+$ concentration during an
odorant response. This increase inhibits and even reverses $Ca^{2+}$ clearance
by $Na^+/Ca^{2+}/K^+$ exchange, which is essential for response termination.
Finally, a $Na^+$ current increases the ciliary osmotic pressure, which could
cause swelling to damage the cilia. By contrast, a transduction pathway based
on $Cl^-$ efflux circumvents these problems and renders the odorant response
robust and reliable.

amplitude and a duration up to tens of milliseconds that overlaps with brain
activity. Methods for TMS artifact correction have been developed to remove the
artifact and recover the underlying, immediate response of the cerebral cortex
to the magnetic stimulus. In this study, three such algorithms are evaluated.
Since there is no ground truth for the masked brain activity, pilot data formed
from the superposition of the isolated TMS artifact on the EEG brain activity
are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Different scenarios of
TMS-EEG experiments are considered for the evaluation: TMS at resting state,
TMS inducing epileptiform discharges and TMS administered during epileptiform
discharges. We show that a proposed gap filling method is able to reproduce
qualitative characteristics and in many cases closely resemble the hidden EEG

choice for this reference time-scale is the duration over which the star

stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. In this paper, we calibrate this
reference time-scale using synthetic emission maps of several SFR tracers,
generated by combining the output from a hydrodynamical disc galaxy simulation
with the SPS model SLUG2. We apply our statistical method to obtain
self-consistent measurements of each tracer's reference time-scale. These
include H${\alpha}$ and 12 ultraviolet (UV) filters (from GALEX, Swift, and
HST), which cover a wavelength range 150-350 nm. At solar metallicity, the
measured reference time-scales of H${\alpha}$ are ${4.32^{+0.09}_{-0.23}}$ Myr
with continuum subtraction, and 6-16 Myr without, where the time-scale
increases with filter width. For the UV filters we find 17-33 Myr, nearly
monotonically increasing with wavelength. The characteristic time-scale
decreases towards higher metallicities, as well as to lower star formation rate
surface densities, owing to stellar initial mass function sampling effects. We
provide fitting functions for the reference time-scale as a function of

the TeV nebulae with the \textsl{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). No

framework of two-zone diffusion spatial templates, suggesting a relatively low
density of GeV electrons/positrons in the TeV nebulae. A joint modelling of the

subjective manually extracted features. This approach is time and energy
consuming as well as immature in prediction due to the partial view toward
which features to be extracted by human. With the rise of deep learning,
artificial intelligence has been making progress toward being a mature
technology. This paper proposes a new approach based on deep learning and
traditional feature engineering called HAR-Net to address the issue related to
HAR. The study used the data collected by gyroscopes and acceleration sensors
in android smart phones. The raw sensor data was put into the HAR-Net proposed.
The HAR-Net fusing the hand-crafted features and high-level features extracted
from convolutional network to make prediction. The performance of the proposed

experimental results on the UCI dataset demonstrate that fusing the two kinds

animals to environmental covariates, and identify habitats that are important
for conservation. The most widely used models of this type, resource selection
functions, assume independence between the observed locations of an animal.
This is unrealistic when location data display spatio-temporal autocorrelation.
Alternatively, step selection functions embed habitat selection in a model of
animal movement, to account for the autocorrelation. However, inferences from
step selection functions depend on the movement model, and they cannot readily
be used to predict long-term space use. We recently suggested that a Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm could define a step selection model with an
explicit stationary distribution: the target distribution. Here, we explain how
the likelihood of a MCMC step selection model is derived, and how maximum
likelihood estimation can be used for inference about parameters of movement
and habitat selection. We describe the local Gibbs sampler, a rejection-free
MCMC scheme designed to capture important features of real animal movement. The
sampler can be used as the basis for a flexible class of movement models, and
we derive the likelihood function for several important special cases. In a
simulation study, we verify that maximum likelihood estimation can be used to
recover all model parameters. We illustrate the application of the method with
data from a plains zebra.

These are the dominant diagrams in the limit of an infinite number of light

examine the results at arbitrary orders in perturbation theory, and assess the
factorial growth associated with renormalons. We look for renormalon effects
leading to corrections of order $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, that we dub `linear'
renormalons, in the inclusive cross section (with and without selection cuts),
in the mass of the reconstructed-top system, and in the average energy of the
final-state $W$ boson, considering both the pole and the $\overline{\rm MS}$

expressed in terms of the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass, does not exhibit linear
renormalons, but, as soon as selection cuts are introduced, jets-related linear
renormalons arise in any mass scheme. In addition, we show that the
reconstructed mass is affected by linear renormalons in any scheme and that the
average energy of the $W$ boson (that we consider as a simplified example of

stronger worst-case guarantee. But amortized data structures are not suitable
for real-time systems, where each individual operation has to be executed
quickly. For this reason, there exist many recent randomized results that aim
to provide a guarantee stronger than amortized expected. The strongest possible
guarantee for a randomized algorithm is that it is always correct (Las Vegas),
and has high-probability worst-case update time, which gives a bound on the
time for each individual operation that holds with high probability.
  In this paper we present the first polylogarithmic high-probability
worst-case time bounds for the dynamic spanner and the dynamic maximal matching
problem. 1. For dynamic spanner, the only known $o(n)$ worst-case bounds were
$O(n^{3/4})$ high-probability worst-case update time for maintaining a
3-spanner and $O(n^{5/9})$ for maintaining a 5-spanner. We give a $O(1)^k
\log^3(n)$ high-probability worst-case time bound for maintaining a
$(2k-1)$-spanner, which yields the first worst-case polylog update time for all
constant $k$. (All the results above maintain the optimal tradeoff of stretch
$2k-1$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/k})$ edges.) 2. For dynamic maximal matching, or
dynamic $2$-approximate maximum matching, no algorithm with $o(n)$ worst-case
time bound was known and we present an algorithm with $O(\log^5(n))$
high-probability worst-case time; similar worst-case bounds existed only for
maintaining a matching that was $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate, and hence not
maximal.
  Our results are achieved using a new black-box reduction that converts any
data structure with worst-case expected update time into one with a
high-probability worst-case update time: the query time remains the same, while
the update time increases by a factor of $O(\log^2(n))$.

it supports practical shape analysis capabilities that operate directly on

By
employing the universal Darboux-dressing scheme we derive solutions for the
hierarchy of integrable PDEs via solutions of the matrix
Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equation, and we also identify recursion relations
that yield the Lax pairs for the whole matrix NLS-type hierarchy. These results
are obtained considering either matrix-integral or general $n^{th}$ order
matrix-differential operators as Darboux-dressing transformations. In this
framework special links with the Airy and Burgers equations are also discussed.
The matrix version of the Darboux transform is also examined leading to the
non-commutative version of the Riccati equation. The non-commutative Riccati
equation is solved and hence suitable conserved quantities are derived. In this
context we also discuss the infinite dimensional case of the NLS matrix model
as it provides a suitable candidate for a quantum version of the usual NLS
model. Similarly, the non-commutitave Riccati equation for the general dressing
transform is derived and it is naturally equivalent to the one emerging from
the solution of the auxiliary linear problem.

quantum world by generalizing the concepts from classical functions to quantum
processes, defining the problem of \emph{PAC learning quantum process}, and
study its sample complexity. In the problem of PAC learning quantum process, we
want to learn an $\epsilon$-approximate of an unknown quantum process $c^*$
from a known finite concept class $C$ with probability $1-\delta$ using samples
$\{(x_1,c^*(x_1)),(x_2,c^*(x_2)),\dots\}$, where $\{x_1,x_2, \dots\}$ are
computational basis states sampled from an unknown distribution $D$ and
$\{c^*(x_1),c^*(x_2),\dots\}$ are the (possibly mixed) quantum states outputted
by $c^*$. The special case of PAC-learning quantum process under constant input
reduces to a natural problem which we named as approximate state
discrimination, where we are given copies of an unknown quantum state $c^*$
from an known finite set $C$, and we want to learn with probability $1-\delta$
an $\epsilon$-approximate of $c^*$ with as few copies of $c^*$ as possible. We
show that the problem of PAC learning quantum process can be solved with
$$O\left(\frac{\log|C| + \log(1/ \delta)} { \epsilon^2}\right)$$ samples when
the outputs are pure states and $$O\left(\frac{\log^3 |C|(\log |C|+\log(1/
\delta))} { \epsilon^2}\right)$$ samples if the outputs can be mixed. Some
implications of our results are that we can PAC-learn a polynomial sized
quantum circuit in polynomial samples and approximate state discrimination can
be solved in polynomial samples even when concept class size $|C|$ is
exponential in the number of qubits, an exponentially improvement over a full
state tomography.

malware, or spam detection, operate in constrained discrete domains. These
applications would benefit from having provable guarantees against adversarial
examples. The existing literature on provable adversarial robustness of models,
however, exclusively focuses on robustness to gradient-based attacks in domains
such as images. These attacks model the adversarial cost, e.g., amount of
distortion applied to an image, as a $p$-norm. We argue that this approach is
not well-suited to model adversarial costs in constrained domains where not all
examples are feasible.
  We introduce a graphical framework that (1) generalizes existing attacks in
discrete domains, (2) can accommodate complex cost functions beyond $p$-norms,
including financial cost incurred when attacking a classifier, and (3)
efficiently produces valid adversarial examples with guarantees of minimal
adversarial cost. These guarantees directly translate into a notion of
adversarial robustness that takes into account domain constraints and the
adversary's capabilities. We show how our framework can be used to evaluate
security by crafting adversarial examples that evade a Twitter-bot detection
classifier with provably minimal number of changes; and to build privacy
defenses by crafting adversarial examples that evade a privacy-invasive
website-fingerprinting classifier.

cognitive domains such as memory and learning, perceptual-motion or executive
function. High rate of deaths and high cost for detection, treatments and
patient's care count amongst its consequences. Early detection of AD is
considered of high importance for improving the quality of life of patients and
their families. The aim of this thesis is to introduce novel non-invasive early
diagnosis methods in order to speed the diagnosis, reduce the associated costs
and make them widely accessible. Novel AD's screening tests based on virtual
environments using new immersive technologies combined with advanced Human
Computer Interaction (HCI) systems are introduced. Four tests demonstrate the
wide range of screening mechanisms based on cognitive domain impairments that
can be designed using virtual environments. The use of emotion recognition to
analyse AD symptoms has been also proposed. A novel multimodal dataset was
specifically created to remark the autobiographical memory deficits of AD
patients. Data from this dataset is used to introduce novel descriptors for
Electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial images data. EEG features are based on
quaternions in order to keep the correlation information between sensors,
whereas, for facial expression recognition, a preprocessing method for motion
magnification and descriptors based on origami crease pattern algorithm are
proposed to enhance facial micro-expressions. These features have been proved
on classifiers such as SVM and Adaboost for the classification of reactions to
autobiographical stimuli such as long and short term memories.

using deep covariance descriptors. The solution is based on the idea of
encoding local and global Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) features
extracted from still images, in compact local and global covariance
descriptors. The space geometry of the covariance matrices is that of Symmetric
Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By conducting the classification of static
facial expressions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a valid Gaussian
kernel on the SPD manifold, we show that deep covariance descriptors are more
effective than the standard classification with fully connected layers and
softmax. Besides, we propose a completely new and original solution to model
the temporal dynamic of facial expressions as deep trajectories on the SPD
manifold. As an extension of the classification pipeline of covariance
descriptors, we apply SVM with valid positive definite kernels derived from
global alignment for deep covariance trajectories classification. By performing
extensive experiments on the Oulu-CASIA, CK+, and SFEW datasets, we show that
both the proposed static and dynamic approaches achieve state-of-the-art
performance for facial expression recognition outperforming many recent
approaches.

are induced by an eavesdropper, Eve, who can replace the transmission line with
a lossless and noiseless optical fiber, she is assumed inaccessible to the

can always extract a larger key compared with the case that all loss and noises

collective Gaussian attacks can be determined numerically for the given
channels' parameters. The improvement of the key rates turns out to be more
significant for the reverse-reconciliation scheme.

the first-order logical environment FOLE. According to Gruber, an ontology
defines the primitives with which to model the knowledge resources for a
community of discourse. These primitives, consisting of classes, relationships
and properties, are represented by the entity-relationship-attribute ERA data
model of Chen. An ontology uses formal axioms to constrain the interpretation
of these primitives. In short, an ontology specifies a logical theory. A series
of three papers by the author provide a rigorous mathematical representation
for the ERA data model in particular, and ontologies in general, within FOLE.
The first two papers, which provide a foundation and superstructure for FOLE,
represent the formalism and semantics of (many-sorted) first-order logic in a
classification form corresponding to ideas discussed in the Information Flow
Framework (IFF). The third paper will define an interpretation of FOLE in terms
of the transformational passage, first described in (Kent, 2013), from the
classification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form,
thereby defining the formalism and semantics of first-order logical/relational
database systems. Two papers will provide a precise mathematical basis for FOLE
interpretation: the current paper develops the notion of a FOLE relational
table following the relational model of Codd, and a follow-up paper will
develop the notion of a FOLE relational database. Both of these papers expand
on material found in the paper (Kent, 2011). Although the classification form
follows the entity-relationship-attribute data model of Chen, the
interpretation form follows the relational data model of Codd. In general, the
FOLE representation uses a conceptual structures approach, that is completely
compatible with formal concept analysis and information flow.

mathematics given by Cassiodorus (in its essential features repeated in
Kolmogorov's famous article ""Mathematics"" from the ""Great Soviet Encyclopedia""
and explored in the author's book ""Humanitarian oriented mathematics teaching
in general school"" (Ryazan, Ryazan Institute of Education Development, 2000,
112 p.). This definition illuminates the exceptional role of language in the
building, discovering, understanding, teaching, and learning of mathematics. We
show that this role is predetermined by the abstract character of mathematics.
The abstract object cannot be shown; it can only be described with the help of
language. This gives rise to the problem of identifying abstract entities on
the grounds of their descriptions. We accentuate the way the language of set
theory helps finding the solution to this problem. We illustrate this through
the examples from elementary geometry and elementary algebra. And we especially
underline the importance of this solution when working with events in the
probability theory. After that, we are going to show how proof and language
help to form and develop imagery thinking and, thereby, illuminate the
possibility of the left brain hemisphere to participate in the formation of
imagery thinking.

dice obtained by caving spheres. We also have a familiar fair device; a coin.
That is, a fair coin can be seen as a fair die with 2 faces. However, a real

as well as non-uniform. At distances far apart from the bunch, in free space
the field reduces to the relativistic modified Coulomb form for a pointlike
charge and at small distances the expressions reproduce the external fields of
a continuous beam. In an ultra-relativistic limit the longitudinal components
of the internal and external electric fields of the bunch are strongly
suppressed by the Lorentz factor. If the bunch is surrounded by conducting
surfaces, the bunch self-fields are modified. Image fields generated by a bunch
between two parallel conducting plates are studied in detail. Exact summation
of the electric, $E_y$, and magnetic, $B_x$, image field components allows the
infinite series to be represented in terms of elementary trigonometric
functions. The new expressions for modified fields are applied to study image
forces acting on the bunch constituents and the bunch as a whole. The coherent
and incoherent tune shifts for an arbitrary bunch displacement from the
midplane are calculated in the framework of an improved linear theory, for both
infinite and finite parallel flat surfaces. Moreover, the developed method
allows us to generalize the Laslett image coefficients $\epsilon_1$,
$\epsilon_2$, $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$ to the case of an arbitrary bunch offset and

specific signature is designed to mask the plaintext, then the masked data can
be securely outsourced to cloud severs. An authorization certificate composing
of the signature and related privilege items is constructed that is used to
grant privileges to data receivers. To ensure security, a unique value is
chosen to mask the certificate for each data receiver. The analysis shows that
the proposed scheme has less computational cost and storage cost compared with
other popular models.

various WSN applications can be managed efficiently. However, maintaining data
security and efficiency of data processing in cloud-WSN (C-WSN) are important
and challenging issues. In this paper, we present an efficient data outsourcing
scheme based on CP-ABE, which can not only guarantee secure data access, but
also reduce overall data processing time. In our proposed scheme, a large file
is divided into several data blocks by data owner (DO) firstly. Then, the data
blocks are encrypted and transferred to the cloud server in parallel. For data
receiver (DR), data decryption and data transmission is also processed in
parallel. In addition, data integrity can be checked by DR without any master
key components. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet
the security requirement of C-WSN. By performance evaluation, it shows that our
scheme can dramatically improve data processing efficiency compared to the
traditional CP-ABE method.

the former is not available in many cases. We evaluate integrals indicated in
the title numerically that are necessary in some approaches in quantum
chemistry. In the title, where R stands for nucleus-electron and r for
electron-electron distances, the n, m= 0 case is trivial, the (n, m)= (1,0) or
(0,1) cases are well known, a fundamental milestone in the integration and
widely used in computational quantum chemistry, as well as analytical
integration is possible if Gaussian functions are used. For the rest of the
cases the analytical solutions are restricted, but worked out for some, e.g.
for n, m= 0,1,2 with Gaussians. In this work we generalize the
Becke-Lebedev-Voronoi 3 dimensions numerical integration scheme (commonly used
in density functional theory) to 6 and 9 dimensions via Descartes product to
evaluate integrals indicated in the title, and test it. This numerical recipe
(up to Gaussian integrands with seed exp(-|r1|2), as well as positive and
negative real n and m values) is useful for manipulation with higher moments of
inter-electronic distances, for example, in correlation calculations; more, our
numerical scheme works for Slaterian type functions with seed exp(-|r1|) as
well.
