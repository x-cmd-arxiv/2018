  Covariance Selection",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Gaussian graphical models are used for determining conditional relationships
between variables. This is accomplished by identifying off-diagonal elements in
the inverse-covariance matrix that are non-zero. When the ratio of variables
(p) to observations (n) approaches one, the maximum likelihood estimator of the
covariance matrix becomes unstable and requires shrinkage estimation. Whereas
several classical (frequentist) methods have been introduced to address this
issue, fully Bayesian methods remain relatively uncommon in practice and
methodological literatures. Here we introduce a Bayesian method for estimating
sparse matrices, in which conditional relationships are determined with
projection predictive selection. With this method, that uses Kullback-Leibler
divergence and cross-validation for neighborhood selection, we reconstruct the
inverse-covariance matrix in both low and high-dimensional settings. Through
simulation and applied examples, we characterized performance compared to
several Bayesian methods and the graphical lasso, in addition to TIGER that
similarly estimates the inverse-covariance matrix with regression. Our results
demonstrate that projection predictive selection not only has superior
performance compared to selecting the most probable model and Bayesian model
averaging, particularly for high-dimensional data, but also compared to the the
Bayesian and classical glasso methods. Further, we show that estimating the
inverse-covariance matrix with multiple regression is often more accurate, with
respect to various loss functions, and efficient than direct estimation. In
low-dimensional settings, we demonstrate that projection predictive selection
also provides competitive performance. We have implemented the projection
predictive method for covariance selection in the R package GGMprojpred

make it more pressing to evaluate objects' accurate quality before
recommendation by employing an effective reputation system. The objects'
quality are often calculated based on their historical information, such as
selected records or rating scores, to help visitors to make decisions before
watching, reading or buying. Usually high quality products obtain a higher
average ratings than low quality products regardless of rating biases or
errors. However many empirical cases demonstrate that consumers may be misled
by rating scores added by unreliable users or deliberate tampering. In this
case, users' reputation, i.e., the ability to rating trustily and precisely,
make a big difference during the evaluating process. Thus, one of the main
challenges in designing reputation systems is eliminating the effects of users'
rating bias on the evaluation results. To give an objective evaluation of each
user's reputation and uncover an object's intrinsic quality, we propose an
iterative balance (IB) method to correct users' rating biases. Experiments on
two online video-provided Web sites, namely MovieLens and Netflix datasets,
show that the IB method is a highly self-consistent and robust algorithm and it
can accurately quantify movies' actual quality and users' stability of rating.
Compared with existing methods, the IB method has higher ability to find the
""dark horses"", i.e., not so popular yet good movies, in the Academy Awards.

the Tsallis monoparametric generalization of the Shannon entropy, yielding
complexity-entropy curves. These curves have proven to enhance the
discrimination among different time series related to stochastic and chaotic
processes of numerical and experimental nature. Here we further explore these
complexity-entropy curves in the context of the R\'enyi entropy, which is
another monoparametric generalization of the Shannon entropy. By combining the
R\'enyi entropy with the proper generalization of the statistical complexity,
we associate a parametric curve (the R\'enyi complexity-entropy curve) with a
given time series. We explore this approach in a series of numerical and
experimental applications, demonstrating the usefulness of this new technique
for time series analysis. We show that the R\'enyi complexity-entropy curves
enable the differentiation among time series of chaotic, stochastic, and

points, whereas curves related to chaotic phenomena have a negative curvature;

principles. Some flux balance analysis (FBA) methods trade flux benefit against
flux cost. However, if flux cost functions are linear and meant to describe
underlying enzyme costs, this entails that enzyme efficiencies are constant and
ignores the interplay between fluxes, metabolite concentrations and enzyme
levels in cells. Here I introduce realistic flux cost functions that describe
an ""overhead cost"", namely the minimum enzyme and metabolite cost associated
with the fluxes in a kinetic model. These flux cost functions have general
mathematical properties. Enzymatic flux cost functions, which represent enzyme
costs, scale proportionally with the flux profile and are concave on the flux
polytope. Kinetic flux cost functions represent the sum of enzyme and
metabolite costs. If two flux profiles are superimposed, their different
demands for metabolite concentrations cause an extra compromise cost, which
makes flux cost functions strictly concave in almost all cases. When fluxes
change their direction, the enzymatic cost jumps abruptly. Here I propose two
methods for flux modelling: Flux Cost Minimisation, a nonlinear variant of FBA
with flux minimisation, and Flux Benefit Optimisation, a nonlinear variant of
FBA with molecular crowding. The optimal flux profiles, at a given flux
benefit, are vertices of the flux polytope. Linear approximations of enzymatic
flux cost can be used in FBA. In contrast to flux costs chosen ad hoc, these
functions reflect the enzyme kinetics and extracellular concentrations in
realistic kinetic models. Based on enzymatic flux costs, we can describe the
cell growth rate as a convex function on the flux polytope and derive
growth-optimal metabolic states and statistical distributions for the fluxes in
cell populations.

rich mechanical behaviours. In this work we examine the mechanics of composites
formed when a single fibre inclusion is placed within discrete fibre networks
of two distinct architectures. In particular, we computationally and
theoretically investigate the mechanics of composites formed when an inclusion
is introduced to Voronoi- and Mikado--type networks within the nonaffine
regime. On subjecting these single inclusion composites to small shear
deformations, we observe different behaviours dependent on the choice of
network geometry. This divergence in mechanical responses is interpreted as a
consequence of architecture-dependent differences in the nonaffine displacement
field. Scaling laws for the increase in network energy due to inclusions of
different lengths, orientations, and elastic properties are proposed and
computationally verified. We present theoretical predictions for critical
values of the inclusion bending and stretching stiffnesses, above which no
further increases in network energy are observed for a given shear deformation.
These predictions are supported by extensive computational evidence. We expect
the architectural differences identified in this work to be pertinent to
theoretical investigations into the complex behaviour of biopolymer networks,

Cycle 24, taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. In particular, we use the
Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) product that facilitates
cut-out magnetograms of solar active regions (AR) in the Sun in near-real-time
(NRT), taken over a five-year interval (2012 - 2016). Our approach utilizes a
set of thirteen predictors, which are not included in the SHARP metadata,
extracted from line-of-sight and vector photospheric magnetograms. We exploit
several Machine Learning (ML) and Conventional Statistics techniques to predict
flares of peak magnitude >M1 and >C1, within a 24 h forecast window. The ML
methods used are multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), support vector machines (SVM)
and random forests (RF). We conclude that random forests could be the
prediction technique of choice for our sample, with the second best method
being multi-layer perceptrons, subject to an entropy objective function. A
Monte Carlo simulation showed that the best performing method gives accuracy
ACC=0.93(0.00), true skill statistic TSS=0.74(0.02) and Heidke skill score
HSS=0.49(0.01) for >M1 flare prediction with probability threshold 15% and

unprecedented accuracy. To infer cosmological constraints, a large ensemble of
survey simulations are required to accurately model cosmological observables
and their covariances. We develop a parallelized multi-lens-plane pipeline
called UFalcon, designed to generate full-sky weak lensing maps from lightcones
within a minimal runtime. It makes use of L-PICOLA, an approximate numerical
code, which provides a fast and accurate alternative to cosmological $N$-Body
simulations. The UFalcon maps are constructed by nesting 2 simulations covering
a redshift-range from $z=0.1$ to $1.5$ without replicating the simulation
volume. We compute the convergence and projected overdensity maps for L-PICOLA
in the lightcone or snapshot mode. The generation of such a map, including the
L-PICOLA simulation, takes about 3 hours walltime on 220 cores. We use the maps
to calculate the spherical harmonic power spectra, which we compare to
theoretical predictions and to UFalcon results generated using the full
$N$-Body code GADGET-2. We then compute the covariance matrix of the full-sky
spherical harmonic power spectra using 150 UFalcon maps based on L-PICOLA in
lightcone mode. We consider the PDF, the higher-order moments and the variance
of the smoothed field variance to quantify the accuracy of the covariance
matrix, which we find to be a few percent for scales $\ell \sim 10^2$ to
$10^3$. We test the impact of this level of accuracy on cosmological
constraints using an optimistic survey configuration, and find that the final
results are robust to this level of uncertainty. The speed and accuracy of our
developed pipeline provides a basis to also include further important features
such as masking, varying noise and will allow us to compute covariance matrices
for models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. [abridged]

depends on the hydrostatic pressure whereas for a dry granular material is
nearly constant. But what happens during the simultaneous discharge of grains
and liquid from a silo? By measuring the flow rate as a function of time, we
found that: (i) different regimes appear, going from constant flow rate
dominated by the effective fluid viscosity to a hydrostatic-like discharge
depending on the aperture and grain size, (ii) the mixed material is always
discharged faster than dry grains but slower than liquid, (iii) for the
mixture, the liquid level drops faster than the grains level but they are
always linearly proportional to one another, and (iv) a sudden growth in the
flow rate happens during the transition from a biphasic to a single phase
discharge. These results are associated to the competition between the decrease
of hydrostatic pressure above the granular bed and the hydrodynamic resistance.
A model combining the Kozeny-Carman, Bernoulli and mass conservation equations
is proposed and the numerical results are in good agreement with experiments.

Different from the existing works which only consider a single antenna at each

have multiple antennas. We first derive the successful content delivery
probability by accounting for the key channel features at sub-6 GHz and mmWave
frequencies. The maximization of the successful content delivery probability is
a challenging problem. To tackle it, we first propose a constrained
cross-entropy algorithm which achieves the near-optimal solution with moderate
complexity. We then develop another simple yet effective heuristic
probabilistic content placement scheme, termed two-stair algorithm, which
strikes a balance between caching the most popular contents and achieving
content diversity. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of
the constrained cross-entropy method and that the two-stair algorithm yields
significantly better performance than only caching the most popular contents.
The comparisons between the sub-6 GHz and mmWave systems reveal an interesting
tradeoff between caching capacity and density for the mmWave system to achieve
similar performance as the sub-6 GHz system.

seeking for ways to relax the risk independence assumption that undermines
typical risk management models. Prominent work has advocated the use of risk
networks as a way forward. Yet, the inevitable biases introduced during the

maximization of the Kendall ${\tau}$ related to the pair (s(X), Y ). From the
theoretical side, we describe the optimal elements of this problem and provide
statistical guarantees for empirical Kendall ${\tau}$ maximization under
appropriate conditions for the class of scoring function candidates. We also
propose a recursive statistical learning algorithm tailored to empirical IROC
curve optimization and producing a piecewise constant scoring function that is
fully described by an oriented binary tree. Preliminary numerical experiments
highlight the difference in nature between regression and continuous ranking
and provide strong empirical evidence of the performance of empirical
optimizers of the criteria proposed.

are markedly different from its overdamped limit. In addition to local
alterations of the transition path geometry, more fundamental global changes
may exist. For instance, when the dissipation is weak, heteroclinic connections
that exist in the overdamped limit do not necessarily have a counterpart in the
Langevin system, potentially leading to different transition rates.
Furthermore, when the friction coefficient depends on the velocity, the
overdamped limit no longer exists, but it is still possible to efficiently find
instantons. The approach we employed for these discoveries was based on (i) a
simple rewriting of the Freidlin-Wentzell action in terms of time-reversed
dynamics, and (ii) an adaptation of the string method, which was originally
designed for gradient systems, to this specific non-gradient system.

such as the fixed node approximation. Furthermore, a new finite-size correction
scheme is presented that makes it possible to treat the UEG in the
thermodynamic limit without loss of accuracy. In addition, we in detail discuss
the construction of a parametrization of the exchange-correlation free energy
that provides a complete description of the UEG and is of crucial importance as
input for the simulation of real WDM applications. Further, we test previous
theories, including restricted PIMC, finite-temperature Green functions, the

generically displays pathological behaviour in terms of non-finite expectation
values and non-unitary dynamics, the finiteness and unitarity of our model are
formally guaranteed. For classically singular models with a massless scalar

features including: i) superpositions of values of the cosmological constant;
ii) universal effective physics due to non-trivial self-adjoint extensions of
the Hamiltonian; and iii) bound `Efimov universe' states for negative
cosmological constant. The last feature provides a new platform for quantum
simulation of the early universe. A companion paper provides detailed

Functions (PNFs) are gradually being replaced by Virtual Network Functions
(VNFs) that are hosted on general purpose servers. Depending on the call flows
for specific services, the packets need to pass through an ordered set of
network functions (physical or virtual) called Service Function Chains (SFC)
before reaching the destination. Conceivably for the next few years during this
transition, these networks would have a mix of PNFs and VNFs, which brings an
interesting mix of network problems that are studied in this paper: (1) How to
find an SFC-constrained shortest path between any pair of nodes? (2) What is
the achievable SFC-constrained maximum flow? (3) How to place the VNFs such
that the cost (the number of nodes to be virtualized) is minimized, while the
maximum flow of the original network can still be achieved even under the SFC
constraint? In this work, we will try to address such emerging questions.
First, for the SFC-constrained shortest path problem, we propose a
transformation of the network graph to minimize the computational complexity of
subsequent applications of any shortest path algorithm. Second, we formulate
the SFC-constrained maximum flow problem as a fractional multicommodity flow
problem, and develop a combinatorial algorithm for a special case of practical
interest. Third, we prove that the VNFs placement problem is NP-hard and
present an alternative Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation. Finally,
we conduct simulations to elucidate our theoretical results.

system a C*-algebra. From a physical point of view it is unclear why operator
algebras would form a good description of nature. In this paper, we find a set
of physically meaningful assumptions such that any physical theory satisfying
these assumptions must embed into the category of finite-dimensional
C*-algebras. These assumptions were originally introduced in the setting of
effectus theory, a categorical logical framework generalizing classical and
quantum logic. As these assumptions have a physical interpretation, this
motivates the usage of operator algebras as a model for quantum theory.
  In contrast to other reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start with
the framework of generalized probabilistic theories and instead use effect
theories where no convex structure and no tensor product needs to be present.
The lack of this structure in effectus theory has led to a different notion of
pure maps. A map in an effectus is pure when it is a composition of a
compression and a filter. These maps satisfy particular universal properties
and respectively correspond to `forgetting' and `measuring' the validity of an
effect.
  We define a pure effect theory (PET) to be an effect theory where the pure
maps form a dagger-category and filters and compressions are adjoint. We show
that any convex finite-dimensional PET must embed into the category of
Euclidean Jordan algebras. Moreover, if the PET also has monoidal structure,
then we show that it must embed into either the category of real or complex
C*-algebras, which completes our reconstruction.

geospatial data, with advance of sensing technologies, and growing complexity
and organisation of vector data. Tools are needed to efficiently create and
edit those vector geospatial data. Procedural generation has been a tool of
choice to generate strongly organised data, yet it may be hard to control.
Because those data may be involved to take consequence-full real life
decisions, user interactions are required to check data and edit it. The
classical process to do so would be to build an adhoc Graphical User Interface
(GUI) tool adapted for the model and method being used. This task is difficult,
takes a large amount of resources, and is very specific to one model, making it
hard to share and re-use.
  Besides, many common generic GUI already exists to edit vector data, each
having its specialities. We propose a change of paradigm; instead of building a
specific tool for one task, we use common GIS software as GUIs, and deport the
specific interactions from the software to within the database. In this
paradigm, GIS software simply modify geometry and attributes of database
layers, and those changes are used by the database to perform automated task.
  This new paradigm has many advantages. The first one is genericity. With
in-base interaction, any GIS software can be used to perform edition, whatever
the software is a Desktop sofware or a web application. The second is
concurrency and coherency. Because interaction is in-base, use of database
features allows seamless multi-user work, and can guarantee that the data is in
a coherent state. Last we propose tools to facilitate multi-user edits, both
during the edit phase (each user knows what areas are edited by other users),
and before and after edit (planning of edit, analyse of edited areas).

line of an M-dwarf most likely in the Galactic disk as part of the joint
Spitzer and ground-based monitoring of microlensing planetary anomalies toward
the Galactic bulge. The microlensing parameters are strongly constrained by the
light curve modeling and in particular by the Spitzer-based measurement of the
microlens parallax, $\pi_\mathrm{E}$. However, in contrast to many planetary
microlensing events, there are no caustic crossings, so the angular Einstein
radius, $\theta_\mathrm{E}$ has only an upper limit based on the light curve
modeling alone. Additionally, the analysis leads us to identify 8 degenerate
configurations: the four-fold microlensing parallax degeneracy being doubled by
a degeneracy in the caustic structure present at the level of the ground-based
solutions. To pinpoint the physical parameters, and at the same time to break
the parallax degeneracy, we make use of a series of arguments: the $\chi^2$
hierarchy, the Rich argument, and a prior Galactic model. The preferred
configuration is for a host at $D_L=3.73_{-0.67}^{+0.66}~\mathrm{kpc}$ with

sub-Jupiter planets orbiting near or beyond the snow line of M-dwarfs

metallicity and star-formation rate (or molecular-gas mass). This is known as
the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) (or molecular-gas FMR), and it has a
profound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still
remains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a
fourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion
around the molecular-gas FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical
parameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass
is found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new four-dimensional
fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the metallicity
dispersion to 50\% of that of the molecular-gas FMR. We suggest that future
analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a
four-dimensional space that includes surface density. The dilution time scale
of gas inflow and the star-formation efficiency could explain the observational
dependence on surface density of stellar mass.

just detect planets but also to characterize them, it is timely to consider
whether there is any prospect of remotely detecting exoplanet topography in the
coming decades. To test this, we devised a novel yet simple approach to detect
and quantify topographical features on the surfaces of exoplanets using transit
light curves. If a planet rotates as it transits its parent star, its changing
silhouette yields a time-varying transit depth, which can be observed as an
apparent and anomalous increase in the photometric scatter. Using elevation
data for several rocky bodies in our solar system, we quantify each world's
surface integrated relief with a ""bumpiness"" factor, and calculate the
corresponding photometric scatter expected during a transit. Here we describe
the kinds of observations that would be necessary to detect topography in the
ideal case of Mars transiting a nearby white dwarf star. If such systems have a
conservative occurrence rate of 10%, we estimate that the upcoming Colossus or
OWL telescopes would be able to detect topography with <20 hours of observing
time, which corresponds to ~400 transits with a duration of 2 minutes and
orbital period of ~10 hours.

cataclysmic system AM Herculis. This particular system is formed by the
magnetic white dwarf (primary) and the red dwarf (secondary), and is the
prototype of so-called polars. Our observations were conducted with the
European VLBI Network (EVN) in the e-EVN mode at 5 GHz. We obtained six
astrometric measurements spanning one year, which make it possible to update
the annual parallax for this system with the best precision to date
($\pi=11.29\pm0.08$ mas), equivalent to the distance of $88.6\pm0.6$ pc. The
system was observed mostly in the quiescent phase (visual magnitude
$m_v\sim15.3$), when the radio emission was at the level of about $300~\mu$Jy.
Our analysis suggests that the radio flux of AM Herculis is modulated with the
orbital motion. Such specific properties of the radiation can be explained
using the emission mechanism similar to the scenario proposed for V471 Tauri
and, in general, for RS CVn type stars. In this scenario the radio emission
arises near the surface of the red dwarf, where the global magnetic field
strength may reach a few kG. We argue that the quiescent radio emission
distinguishes AM Herculis together with AR Ursae Majoris (the second known
persistent radio polar) from other polars, as the systems with a magnetized
secondary star.

star formation rate (SFR) of $\rm 7.5\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. We find that 25% of
these low-mass/low-SFR galaxies are rotation dominated, while the majority of
our sample shows no velocity gradient. When combining our data with other
surveys, we find that the fraction of rotation dominated galaxies increases
with the stellar mass, and decreases for galaxies with a positive offset from
the main sequence. We also investigate the evolution of the intrinsic velocity
dispersion, $\sigma_0$, as a function of the redshift, $z$, and stellar mass,
$\rm M_\star$, assuming galaxies in quasi-equilibrium (Toomre Q parameter equal
to 1). From the $z-\sigma_0$ relation, we find that the redshift evolution of
the velocity dispersion is mostly expected for massive galaxies ($\rm
log(M_\star/M_\odot)>10$). We derive a $\rm M_\star-\sigma_0$ relation, using
the Tully-Fisher relation, which highlights that a different evolution of the
velocity dispersion is expected depending on the stellar mass, with lower
velocity dispersions for lower masses, and an increase for higher masses,
stronger at higher redshift. The observed velocity dispersions from this work
and from comparison samples spanning $0<z<3.5$ appear to follow this relation,
except at higher redshift ($z>2$), where we observe higher velocity dispersions
for low masses ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim 9.6$) and lower velocity
dispersions for high masses ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim 10.9$) than
expected. This discrepancy could, for instance, suggest that galaxies at
high-$z$ do not satisfy the stability criterion, or that the adopted
parametrisation of the specific star formation rate and molecular properties
fail at high redshift.

precursors of a Trappist-1 like system under the action of accretion and
external photoevaporation in different radiation environments. Dust grains
swiftly grow above the critical size below which they are entrained in the
photoevaporative wind, so although gas is continually depleted, dust is
resilient to photoevaporation after only a short time. This means that the
ratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises
steadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass
required to produce the observed $4\,M_{\oplus}$ of Trappist-1 planets is high.
For example, assuming a Fatuzzo & Adams (2008) distribution of UV fields,
typical initial disc masses have to be $>30\,$per cent the stellar (which are
still Toomre $Q$ stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable
hosts of the Trappist-1 planets. Even in the case of the lowest UV environments
observed, there is a strong loss of dust due to photoevaporation at early times
from the weakly bound outer regions of the disc. This minimum level of dust
loss is a factor two higher than that which would be lost by accretion onto the
star during 10 Myr of evolution. Consequently even in these least irradiated
environments, discs that are viable Trappist-1 precursors need to be initially
massive ($>10\,$per cent of the stellar mass).

capable of scaled and exact DCT computation and its associated fast algorithm
achieves the theoretical minimal multiplicative complexity for the 8-point DCT.
Depending on the nature of the input signal simplifications can be introduced

the galaxy disk, supplying materials for star formation. We developed a gaseous
halo model connecting the galaxy disk and the gaseous halo by assuming the star
formation rate on the disk is balanced by the radiative cooling rate of the
gaseous halo, including stellar feedback. In addition to a single-temperature
gaseous halo in collisional ionization equilibrium, we also consider the
photoionization effect and a steady-state cooling model. Photoionization is
important for modifying the ion distribution in low-mass galaxies and outskirts
of massive galaxies due to the low densities. The multi-phase cooling model
dominates the region within the cooling radius, where t_cooling=t_Hubble. Our
model reproduces most of the observed high ionization state ions for a wide
range of galaxy masses (i.e., OVI, OVII, NeVIII, MgX, and OVIII). We find that
the OVI column density has a narrow range around ~10^14 cm^-2 for halo masses
from M_star ~ 3 * 10^10 Msun to 6*10^12 Msun, which is consistent with some but
not all observational studies. For galaxies with halo masses <~ 3 * 10^11 Msun,
photoionization produces most of the OVI, while for more massive galaxies, the
OVI is from the medium that is cooling from higher temperatures. Fitting the
Galactic (Milky-Way) OVII and OVIII suggests a gaseous halo model where the
metallicity is ~0.55 Zsun and the gaseous halo has a maximum temperature of ~
1.9 * 10^6 K. This gaseous halo model does not close the census of baryonic
material within R200.

systems and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are regularly attributed to
truncated accretion disks, but a detailed understanding of the flow dynamics is
lacking. In these systems the truncation is expected to arise through thermal
instability driven by sharp changes in the radiative efficiency. We emulate
this behavior using a simple bistable cooling function with efficient and
inefficient branches. The accretion flow takes on an arrangement where a
""transition zone"" exists in between hot gas in the inner most regions and a
cold, Shakura $\&$ Sunyaev thin disk at larger radii. The thin disk is embedded
in an atmosphere of hot gas that is fed by a gentle outflow originating from
the transition zone. Despite the presence of hot gas in the inner disk,
accretion is efficient. Our analysis focuses on the details of the angular
momentum transport, energetics, and magnetic field properties. We find that the
magnetic dynamo is suppressed in the hot, truncated inner region of the disk

deformation and emulsion rheology of a dilute suspension of droplets in a
linear flow. The droplets are laden with surfactants that are bulk-insoluble
and get transported only along the interface. An asymptotic approach is adopted
for the present analysis in order to tackle the nonlinearity present due to
deformation of droplets. The analysis is carried out under two different
limiting scenarios namely: surface diffusion-dominated-surfactant transport and
surface convection-dominated surfactant transport. For either of the limiting
cases we look into the droplet dynamics for two commonly encountered bulk flows
- uniaxial extensional and simple shear flow. Under the assumption of
negligible fluid inertia in either phase, it is shown that slip at the droplet
interface significantly affects the surfactant-induced Marangoni stress and
hence droplet deformation and emulsion rheology. Presence of interfacial slip
not only brings about a decrease in the droplet deformation but also reduces
the effective viscosity of the emulsion. The fall in both droplet deformation
and effective viscosity is found to be more severe for the limiting case of
surface convection-dominated surfactant transport. For the case of an imposed
simple shear flow, the normal stress differences generated due to droplet
deformation are affected as well due to the presence of interfacial slip.

in the slow solar wind (SSW), relative to those in the photosphere, show
different patterns as a function of the first ionization potential (FIP) of the
elements. Generally, the SEP and SSW abundances reflect abundance samples of
the solar corona, where low-FIP elements, ionized in the chromosphere, are more
efficiently conveyed upward to the corona than high-FIP elements that are
initially neutral atoms. Abundances of the elements, especially C, P, and S
show a crossover from low to high FIP at ~10 eV in the SEPs but ~14 eV for the
solar wind. Naively this seems to suggest cooler plasma from sunspots beneath
active regions. More likely, if the ponderomotive force of Alfv\'en waves
preferentially conveys low-FIP ions into the corona, the source plasma that
eventually will be shock-accelerated as SEPs originates in magnetic structures
where Alfv\'en waves resonate with the loop length on closed magnetic field
lines. This concentrates FIP fractionation near the top of the chromosphere.
Meanwhile, the source of the SSW may lie near the base of diverging open-field
lines surrounding, but outside of, active regions, where such resonance does
not exist, allowing fractionation throughout the chromosphere. We also find
that energetic particles accelerated from the solar wind itself by shock waves
at corotating interaction regions (CIRs), generally beyond 1 AU, confirm the
FIP pattern of the solar wind.

are rooted in rather ad hoc and fine-tuned initial conditions, such as the
simultaneous requirements of extremely low metallicities and strong radiation
backgrounds. Here we explore a modification of such scenarios where a massive
primordial star cluster is initially produced. Subsequent stellar collisions
give rise to the formation of massive (10^4 - 10^5 solar mass) objects. Our
calculations demonstrate that the interplay between stellar dynamics, gas
accretion and protostellar evolution is particularly relevant. Gas accretion
onto the protostars enhances their radii, resulting in an enhanced collisional
cross section. We show that the fraction of collisions can increase from 0.1-1%
of the initial population to about 10% when compared to gas-free models or
models of protostellar clusters in the local Universe. We conclude that very
massive objects can form in spite of initial fragmentation, making the first
massive protostellar clusters viable candidate birth places for observed
supermassive black holes.

participants $N_{part}$. The study concluded that $N_{part}$ increases to
nearly 16 in central collisions, and the high-$p_t$ region of $p$-Pb $p_t$
spectra rescaled by the Glauber-estimated number of $p$-N binary collisions
remains consistent with a $p$-$p$ spectrum for the same energy, independent of
$p$-Pb centrality. However, the relation between $N_{part}$ and $n_{ch}$
derived from a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) study of ensemble-mean
$\bar p_t$ data for the same system is quite different. This article reports a
detailed analysis of the Glauber study and the question of centrality in $p$-A
collisions. The Glauber centrality model is compared with the $\bar p_t$ TCM to
understand the sources of major differences. The assumption of linear
proportionality between $n_{ch}$ and $N_{part}$ is found to be inconsistent
with $\bar p_t$ data. Properties of the convolution integral relating a
differential cross section and hadron production model to an event distribution
on $n_{ch}$ are examined. An alternative differential-cross-section
distribution is inferred from charge-multiplicity data, and the upper limit on
$N_{part}$ is estimated to be near 8. The TCM centrality model is then applied
to $p_t$ spectrum ratios to predict results for $p$-Pb spectra. The spectrum
TCM is tested with identified-pion spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions and the
result is consistent with previous $p$-$p$ TCM results. A TCM prediction that
the spectrum ratio at high $p_t$ should increase to 14 for central $p$-Pb

Although many existing works have studied computation offloading policies,
service caching is an equally, if not more important, design topic of MEC, yet
receives much less attention. Service caching refers to caching application
services and their related databases/libraries in the edge server (e.g.
MEC-enabled BS), thereby enabling corresponding computation tasks to be

quality of signal reconstruction, there actually exist incompatible
combinations of quantization functions and sensing matrices that proscribe
arbitrarily low reconstruction error when the number of measurements increases.
This work shows that a large class of random matrix constructions known to
respect the restricted isometry property (RIP) is ""compatible"" with a simple
scalar and uniform quantization if a uniform random vector, or a random dither,
is added to the compressive signal measurements before quantization. In the

compatibility is demonstrated by the existence of (at least) one signal
reconstruction method, the projected back projection (PBP), whose
reconstruction error decays when the number of measurements increases.
Interestingly, given one RIP matrix and a single realization of the dither, a
small reconstruction error can be proved to hold uniformly for all signals in
the considered low-complexity set. We confirm these observations numerically in
several scenarios involving sparse signals, low-rank matrices, and compressible

Previously proposed mathematical models either supply an explicit framework for

provide a comprehensive theory. We set up a general model for chemical reaction
systems that properly accounts for energetics, kinetics and the conservation
law. We find that (1) some systems are collectively-catalytic where reactants
are transformed into end products with the assistance of intermediates (as in
the citric acid cycle), while some others are self-replicating where different
parts replicate each other and the system self-replicates as a whole (as in the

that by using random signature sequences and by exploiting sparsity in the user
activity pattern, the joint user detection and channel estimation problem can
be formulated as a compressed sensing single measurement vector (SMV) problem
or multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem, depending on whether the BS has a

the channel statistics. Simulation results demonstrate the substantial
advantage of exploiting the statistical channel information in AMP design;
however, knowing the large-scale fading component does not offer tangible

are more challenging to study, due to the nonlinearity and nonlocality of
neural fields, whose interactions are described by the kernel of an integral
term. Here, we leverage interface methods to describe the threshold of wave
initiation away from equilibrium. In particular, we focus on traveling front
initiation in an excitatory neural field. In a neural field with a Heaviside
firing rate, neural activity can be described by the dynamics of the
interfaces, where the neural activity is at the firing threshold. This allows
us to derive conditions for the portion of the neural field that must be
activated for traveling fronts to be initiated in a purely excitatory neural
field. Explicit equations are possible for a single active (superthreshold)
region, and special cases of multiple disconnected active regions. The dynamic
spreading speed of the excited region can also be approximated asymptotically.
We also discuss extensions to the problem of finding the critical

been used to study the isomorphism conjecture for NP and completeness for

  Under various hypotheses, we obtain the following separations:
  1. There is a set complete for NP under nonuniform many-one reductions, but
not under uniform many-one reductions. This is true even with a single bit of
nonuniform advice.
  2. There is a set complete for NP under nonuniform many-one reductions with
polynomial-size advice, but not under uniform Turing reductions. That is,
polynomial nonuniformity is stronger than a polynomial number of queries.
  3. For any fixed polynomial p(n), there is a set complete for NP under

it more powerful than a nonuniform reduction with fixed polynomial advice.

magnetic activity on the mechanism of the first ionization potential (FIP)
effect, while the Ne/O ratio can be used to infer the solar photospheric
abundance of neon, which can not be measured directly. The average Mg/Ne ratio
is found to be $0.52\pm 0.11$, which applies over the temperature region
0.2--0.7~MK, and is consistent with the earlier study. The Ne/O ratio is,
however, about 40\%\ larger, taking the value $0.24\pm 0.05$ that applies to
the temperature range 0.08--0.40~MK. The increase is mostly due to changes in
ionization and recombination rates that affect the equilibrium ionization
balance. If the Ne/O ratio is interpreted as reflecting the photospheric ratio,
then the photospheric neon abundance is $8.08\pm 0.09$ or $8.15\pm 0.10$ (on a
logarithmic scale for which hydrogen is 12), according to whether the oxygen

formation of massive stars and intermediate mass black holes within the first
star clusters. In the early Universe, the first stellar clusters were
particularly dense, as fragmentation typically only occurred at densities above
$10^9$cm$^{-3}$, and the radii of the protostars were enhanced due to the
larger accretion rates, suggesting a potentially more relevant role of stellar
collisions. We present here a detailed parameter study to assess how the number
of collisions as well as the mass growth of the most massive object depends on
the properties of the cluster, and we characterize the time evolution with
three effective parameters, the time when most collisions occur, the duration
of the collisions period, as well as the normalization required to obtain the
total number of collisions. We apply our results to typical Population III
(Pop.III) clusters of about $1000$M$_\odot$, finding that a moderate
enhancement of the mass of the most massive star by a factor of a few can be
expected. For more massive Pop.III clusters as expected in the first atomic
cooling halos, we expect a more significant enhancement by a factor of $15-32$.
We therefore conclude that collisions in massive Pop.III clusters were likely
relevant to form the first intermediate mass black holes.

current circuit QED technology. First, monitoring the photon number difference
can be done without turning off the currently implementable dissipative
stabilizing process. Second, a lower average photon number per mode is required
to enjoy a level of protection at least as good as that of the cat-codes. We
discuss circuit QED proposals to stabilize the code states, perform gates, and
protect against photon loss via either active syndrome measurement or an
autonomous procedure. We introduce quasiprobability distributions allowing us
to represent two-mode states of fixed photon number difference in a
two-dimensional complex plane, instead of the full four-dimensional two-mode
phase space. The two-mode codes are generalized to multiple modes in an
extension of the stabilizer formalism to non-diagonalizable stabilizers. The
$M$-mode codes can protect against either arbitrary photon losses in up to
$M-1$ modes or arbitrary losses and gains in any one mode.

emerging standard that aims at enhancing air traffic management (ATM) by
transitioning the traditional analog aeronautical communication systems to the
superior and highly efficient digital domain. L-DACS1 employs modern and
efficient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
technique to achieve more efficient and higher data rate in comparison to the
existing aeronautical communication systems. However, the performance of OFDM
systems is very sensitive to synchronization errors. L-DACS1 transmission is in
the L-band aeronautical channels that suffer from large interference and large
Doppler shifts, which makes the synchronization for L-DACS more challenging.
This paper proposes a novel computationally efficient synchronization method
for L-DACS1 systems that offers robust performance. Through simulation, the
proposed method is shown to provide accurate symbol timing offset (STO)

range of aeronautical channels. In particular, it can yield excellent
synchronization performance in the face of a large carrier frequency offset.

and are produced through some sort of accumulation, are called Reductions.
Reductions appear in many scientific applications. Usually, reductions admit an
associative and commutative binary operator over accumulation. Reductions are
therefore highly parallel. Given unbounded fan-in, one can execute a reduction
in constant/linear time provided that the data is available. However, due to
the fact that real machines have bounded fan-in, accumulations cannot be
performed in one time step and have to be broken into parts. Thus, a (partial)
serialization of reductions becomes necessary. This makes scheduling reductions
a difficult and interesting problem.
  There have been a number of research works in the context of scheduling
reductions. We focus on the scheduling techniques presented in Gupta et al.,
identify a potential issue in their scheduling algorithm and provide a
solution. In addition, we demonstrate how these scheduling techniques can be
extended to ""tile"" reductions and briefly survey other studies that address the

showing that there is no voting rule for four or more candidates that

assuming for contradiction that $\Lambda < 0$, and then analyzing the dynamics
of zeroes of $H_t$ (building on the work of Csordas, Smith, and Varga) to
obtain increasingly strong control on the zeroes of $H_t$ in the range $\Lambda

government initiative emerging in the last decade. To understand benefits and
challenges associated with this initiative worldwide, we conducted analyses on
research articles published in the e-governance area between 2008 and 2017.
Content analysis and citation analysis were performed on 2105 articles to
address three questions: (1) What types of new ICT have been adopted in the IPG
initiative in the past decade? (2) How did scholars investigate interactions
between the new ICTs and governance core to IPG? (3) How did the new ICTs
interact and shape while also being shaped by the evolution of governance in
the past decade? Our analysis suggests that IPG initiative has enriched the
government information infrastructure. It presented opportunities to accumulate
and use huge volume of data for better decision making and proactive
government-citizen interaction. At the same time, the advance of open data, the
widespread use of social media and the potential of data analytics also
generated great pressure to address challenging questions and issues in the
domain of e-democracy.

techniques, can be broadly classified into two categories: dynamic techniques
(that rely on run-time execution information) and static techniques (that
operate directly on source and test code). Absent from this current body of
work is a comprehensive study aimed at understanding and evaluating the static
approaches and comparing them to dynamic approaches on a large set of projects.
  In this work, we perform the first extensive study aimed at empirically
evaluating four static TCP techniques comparing them with state-of-research
dynamic TCP techniques at different test-case granularities (e.g., method and
class-level) in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and similarity of faults
detected. This study was performed on 30 real-word Java programs encompassing
431 KLoC. In terms of effectiveness, we find that the static call-graph-based
technique outperforms the other static techniques at test-class level, but the
topic-model-based technique performs better at test-method level. In terms of
efficiency, the static call-graph-based technique is also the most efficient
when compared to other static techniques. When examining the similarity of
faults detected for the four static techniques compared to the four dynamic
ones, we find that on average, the faults uncovered by these two groups of
techniques are quite dissimilar, with the top 10% of test cases agreeing on
only 25% - 30% of detected faults. This prompts further research into the
severity/importance of faults uncovered by these techniques, and into the
potential for combining static and dynamic information for more effective
approaches.

higher mAP than SSD by 1.1%, the frames per second (FPS) decreases from 46 to
11.8. In this paper, we propose a single stage end-to-end image detection model
called ESSD to overcome this dilemma. Our solution to this problem is to
cleverly extend better context information for the shallow layers of the best
single stage (e.g. SSD) detectors. Experimental results show that our model can
reach 79.4% mAP, which is higher than DSSD and SSD by 0.8 and 1.9 points

recent work by Badr et al. extended this result and introduced a sliding-window
channel model $\mathcal{C}(N,B,W)$. Under this model, in a sliding-window of
width $W$, one of the following erasure patterns are possible (i) a burst of

recover with a time delay $T$, from any erasure patterns permissible under the

absent, except for a few parameter sets. In this paper, we present an explicit

mobile applications as ""smart"" devices near ubiquitous adoption. Due to this
trend, the complexity of mobile applications has been increasing, making
development and maintenance particularly challenging. However, it is clear that
current bug tracking systems are not able effectively support construction of
reports with actionable information that will directly lead to a bug's
resolution. To address the need for an improved reporting system, we introduce
a novel solution, called FUSION, that helps users auto-complete reproduction
steps in bug reports for mobile apps. FUSION links information, that users
provide, to program artifacts extracted through static and dynamic analysis
performed before testing or release. The approach that FUSION employs is
generalizable to other current mobile software platforms, and constitutes a new
method by which off-device bug reporting can be conducted for mobile software
projects. We evaluate FUSION by conducting a study that quantitatively and
qualitatively measures the user experience of the system for both reporting and
reproducing bugs, as well as the quality of the bug reports it produces. In a
study involving 28 participants we apply FUSION to support the maintenance
tasks of reporting and reproducing defects on 15 real-world bugs found in 14
open source Android apps. Our results demonstrate that FUSION allows for more
reliable reproduction of bugs from reports by aiding users in reporting more

normalization coefficients (ANC) from phase-shift data has been formulated,
proved and used for bound states. This method differs from the conventional one
by fitting only the nuclear part of the effective-range function which includes
a partial phase shift. It should be applied to large-charge nuclei when the
conventional effective-range expansion or the Pad\'e-approximations using the
effective-range function $K_l(k^2)$ fitting do not work. A typical example is
the nucleus vertex $\alpha+^{12}$C $\longleftrightarrow ^{16}$O. Here we apply
the $\Delta$ method, which totally excludes the effective-range function, to
isolated resonance states. In fact, we return to the initial renormalized
scattering amplitude with a denominator which defines the well-known pole
condition. Concrete calculations are made for the resonances observed in the
$^3$He-$^4$He, $\alpha$-$\alpha$, and $\alpha$-$^{12}$C collisions. We use the
experimental phase-shift and resonant energy data including their uncertainties
and find the ANC variations for the states considered. The corresponding
results are in a good agreement with those for the $S$-matrix pole method which
uses the differing formalism. The simple formula for narrow resonances given in
the literature is used to check the deduced results. The related ANC function
clearly depends on the resonance energy ($E_0$) and width ($\Gamma$), which is
used to find the ANC uncertainty ($\Delta$ANC) through the energy ($\Delta
E_0$) and the width ($\Delta\Gamma$) uncertainties.We also discuss the $\Delta$
method differences between bound and resonance states pole conditions.

applications will continue on a trajectory to becoming more complex, and the
primary focus of millions of developers worldwide. In order to properly create
and maintain these apps developers will need support, especially with regard to
the prompt confirmation and resolution of bug reports. Unfortunately, current
issue tracking systems typically only implement collection of coarse grained
natural language descriptions, and lack features to facilitate reporters
including important information in their reports. This illustrates the lexical
information gap that exists in current bug reporting systems for mobile and
GUI-based apps. This paper outlines promising preliminary work towards
addressing this problem and proposes a comprehensive research program which
aims to implement new bug reporting mechanisms and examine the impact that they
might have on related software maintenance tasks.

wireless localisation for scenarios where, instead of absolute positioning of
an object, only the information whether an object is inside or outside of a
specific area is required. This is motivated through a number of applications
including, but not limited to, a) security: detecting whether an object is
removed from a secure location, b) wireless sensor networks: detecting sensor
movements outside of a network area, and c) computational behaviour analytics:
detecting customers leaving a retail store. The result of such detection
systems can naturally be utilised in building a higher level contextual
understanding of a system or user behaviours. We use a supervised learning
method to overcome issues related to RSS based localisation systems including
multipath fading, shadowing, and incorrect model parameters (as in unsupervised
methods). Moreover, to reduce the cost of collecting training data, we employ a
detection method called One-Class SVM (OC-SVM) which requires only one class of
data (positive data, or target class data) for training. We derive a
mathematical approximation of accuracy which utilises the characteristics of
wireless signals as well as OC-SVM. Based on this we then propose a novel
mathematical formula to find optimal placement of devices. This enables us to
optimize the placement without performing any costly experiments or
simulations. We validate our proposed mathematical framework based on simulated
and real experiments.

a novel probe of their redshift evolution independent of the luminosity

the efficiency of community detection algorithms. In this paper, we study the

Given a distributed, undirected and unweighted graph, the goal is to detect
overlapping communities incrementally as the graph is dynamically changing. We
propose an efficient algorithm, called \textit{randomized Speaker-Listener
Label Propagation Algorithm} (rSLPA), based on the \textit{Speaker-Listener
Label Propagation Algorithm} (SLPA) by relaxing the probability distribution of
label propagation. Besides detecting high-quality communities, rSLPA can
incrementally update the detected communities after a batch of edge insertion
and deletion operations. To the best of our knowledge, rSLPA is the first
algorithm that can incrementally capture the same communities as those obtained
by applying the detection algorithm from the scratch on the updated graph.
Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
and the results show that our algorithm can achieve high accuracy and
efficiency at the same time.

of the laser-accelerated hot sheath electrons and the resulting space-charge

maximum energy of the accelerated protons obtained from three-dimensional (3D)
simulations is usually much less that from two-dimensional (2D) simulations. By
closely examining the TNSA of protons in 2D and 3D PIC simulations, we deduce
an empirical ratio between the maximum proton energies obtained from the 2D and

with the appearance of two series of jets, with velocities comparable to the
Alfv\'en speeds in their footpoints. Several pieces of evidence of magnetic
braiding in the eruption are revealed, including localized bright knots,
multiple well-separated jet threads, transition region explosive events and the
fact that all these three are falling into the same locations within the
eruptive structures. Through analysis of the extrapolated three-dimensional
magnetic field in the region, we found that the eruptive spiral structure
corresponded well to locations of twisted magnetic flux tubes with varying curl
values along their lengths. The eruption occurred where strong parallel
currents, high squashing factors, and large twist numbers were obtained. The
electron number density of the eruptive structure is found to be
$\sim3\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that significant amount of mass
could be pumped into the corona by the jets. Following the eruption, the
extrapolations revealed a set of seemingly relaxed loops, which were visible in
the AIA 94 \AA\ channel indicating temperatures of around 6.3 MK. With these
observations, we suggest that magnetic braiding could be part of the mechanisms

recent years due to its paradoxical experimental signatures: while some
quantities show an insulating behavior, others point to a metallic state. This
has led to the conjecture that SmB$_6$ hosts nontrivial excitations within its
bulk gap, and has spawned several theories to that effect. In principle, there
exists an alternative possibility: the system is a metal but unusually with
both metal- and insulator-like properties. Inspired by this possibility, I
consider a minimal model of a Kondo insulator---a flat band hybridized with a
parabolic band---that is slightly electron doped, i.e., the chemical potential
is in the conduction band but close to the band edge. By calculating the dc
conductivity, ac conductivity, specific heat, and quantum oscillations at the
phenomenological level, I show that these quantities exhibit unusual behaviors
that are, surprisingly, qualitatively consistent with those observed
experimentally in SmB$_6$. The rapid change of band curvature around the
chemical potential arising from the strong particle-hole asymmetry and the
narrow gap in the model, a feature not usually encountered in the textbook
cases of metals or insulators, is at the heart of the unusual behaviors.

developed several efficient numerical methods to calculate quasi-periodic

through random phase screens mimicking turbulence and show that the intensity
profile of the beam containing a C-point polarization singularity shows
maximally robust behavior. This observation is explained in terms of the
polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) diversity in the beam. The $l =
0$ and $l = 1$ OAM states whose vector combination leads to the C-point
singularity are seen to produce complementary speckle intensity patterns with
significant negative correlation on propagation through a random phase screen.
This unique property of C-point singularity makes it superior to other
inhomogeneous polarization states as demonstrated in our experiments. The
results provide an important generic guideline for designing beams that can
maintain optimally robust beam intensity profile on passing through random
phase fluctuations and are expected to have a number of applications.

also operates as a CNOT. We demonstrate 74.1(1.6)% overlap between the observed

The reconnection event occurred between the threads of a twisted arch filament
system (AFS) and coronal loops. Our observations reveal that the relaxation of
the twisted AFS drives some of its threads to encounter the coronal loops,
providing inflows of the reconnection. The reconnection is evidenced by flared
X-shape features in the AIA images, a current-sheet-like feature apparently
connecting post-reconnection loops in the \halpha$+$1 \AA\ images, small-scale
magnetic cancellation in the HMI magnetograms and flows with speeds of 40--80
km/s along the coronal loops. The post-reconnection coronal loops seen in AIA
94 \AA\ passband appear to remain bright for a relatively long time, suggesting
that they have been heated and/or filled up by dense plasmas previously stored
in the AFS threads. Our observations suggest that the twisted magnetic system
could release its free magnetic energy into the upper solar atmosphere through
reconnection processes. While the plasma pressure in the reconnecting flux
tubes are significantly different, the reconfiguration of field lines could
result in transferring of mass among them and induce heating therein.

RBF network on the prediction of optimal threshold value when the same number
of neurons is used at the hidden layer for both networks. Besides, the optimal
threshold values obtained using ANNs are verified by the optimal threshold
values obtained numerically using the closed form expression derived for the
system. The results show that the optimal threshold values obtained by ANNs on
the best relay selection scheme provide a minimum Bit-Error-Rate (BER) because
of the reduction of the probability that error propagation may occur. Also, for
the same BER performance goal, prediction of optimal threshold values provides

variations of the mass-to-luminosity ratio (ML). It is found that ML has
generally a central peak or a plateau, and decreases to a local minimum at
$R\sim 0.1-0.2 h$, where $R$ is the radius and $h$ is the scale radius of
optical disk. The ML ratio, then, increases rapidly till $\sim 0.5h$, and is
followed by gradual rise till $\sim 2h$, remaining at around ML$\sim 2$ in w1

r-band ($\lambda$6200-7500 A). Beyond this radius, ML steeply increases toward
the observed edges at $R\sim 5h$, attaining values as high as ML$\sim 20$ in w1

distributed storage that achieve low repair bandwidth and complexity at the
expense of a lower fault tolerance. The construction is based on two classes of
codes, where the primary goal of the first class of codes is to provide fault
tolerance, while the second class aims at reducing the repair bandwidth and
repair complexity. The repair procedure is a two- step procedure where parts of
the failed node are repaired in the first step using the first code. The
downloaded symbols during the first step are cached in the memory and used to
repair the remaining erased data symbols at minimal additional read cost during
the second step. The first class of codes is based on MDS codes modified using
piggybacks, while the second class is designed to reduce the number of
additional symbols that need to be downloaded to repair the remaining erased
symbols. We numerically show that the proposed codes achieve better repair
bandwidth compared to MDS codes, codes constructed using piggybacks, and local
reconstruction/Pyramid codes, while a better repair complexity is achieved when
compared to MDS, Zigzag, Pyramid codes, and codes constructed using piggybacks.

allowable sequences are \emph{universal} and consequently deciding the
realizability is complete in the \emph{existential theory of the reals} (\ER).
This result holds even if the realization space of the order type induced by
the allowable sequence is non-empty. Furthermore, we argue that our result is a
useful tool for further geometric reductions. We support this by giving
\ER-hardness proofs for the realizability of abstract convex geometries and for
the recognition problem of visibility graphs of polygons with holes using the

is proposed here within the framework of the asymptotic hypothesis in the 2D

Bessel function of order zero and the sizes, shapes and permittivities of the
inhomogeneities. Thanks to this analytical expression the limitations of the
DSM method when one of the inhomogeneities is smaller and/or has lower

proposed to overcome this intrinsic limitation in the case of multiple incident

some model-theoretic results. More in particular, we discuss a number of
semantic properties pertaining to formulas of the modal $\mu$-calculus. For
each of these properties we provide a corresponding syntactic fragment, in the
sense that a $\mu$-formula $\xi$ has the given property iff it is equivalent to
a formula $\xi'$ in the corresponding fragment. Since this formula $\xi'$ will
always be effectively obtainable from $\xi$, as a corollary, for each of the
properties under discussion, we prove that it is decidable in elementary time
whether a given $\mu$-calculus formula has the property or not.
  The properties that we study all concern the way in which the meaning of a
formula $\xi$ in a model depends on the meaning of a single, fixed proposition
letter $p$. For example, consider a formula $\xi$ which is monotone in $p$;
such a formula a formula $\xi$ is called continuous (respectively, fully
additive), if in addition it satisfies the property that, if $\xi$ is true at a
state $s$ then there is a finite set (respectively, a singleton set) $U$ such
that $\xi$ remains true at $s$ if we restrict the interpretation of $p$ to the
set $U$. Each of the properties that we consider is, in a similar way,
associated with one of the following special kinds of subset of a tree model:
singletons, finite sets, finitely branching subtrees, noetherian subtrees
(i.e., without infinite paths), and branches.
  Our proofs for these characterization results will be automata-theoretic in
nature; we will see that the effectively defined maps on formulas are in fact
induced by rather simple transformations on modal automata. Thus our results
can also be seen as a contribution to the model theory of modal automata.

the low-energy tail of the synchrotron self Compton (SSC) photons during
different epochs of flaring. Our results show that the contemporaneous

various computer vision applications. In recent years, FPGA-based CNN
accelerators have been proposed for optimizing performance and power
efficiency. Most accelerators are designed for object detection and recognition
algorithms that are performed on low-resolution (LR) images. However, real-time
image super-resolution (SR) cannot be implemented on a typical accelerator
because of the long execution cycles required to generate high-resolution (HR)
images, such as those used in ultra-high-definition (UHD) systems. In this
paper, we propose a novel CNN accelerator with efficient parallelization
methods for SR applications. First, we propose a new methodology for optimizing
the deconvolutional neural networks (DCNNs) used for increasing feature maps.
Secondly, we propose a novel method to optimize CNN dataflow so that the SR
algorithm can be driven at low power in display applications. Finally, we
quantize and compress a DCNN-based SR algorithm into an optimal model for
efficient inference using on-chip memory. We present an energy-efficient
architecture for SR and validate our architecture on a mobile panel with
quad-high-definition (QHD) resolution. Our experimental results show that, with
the same hardware resources, the proposed DCNN accelerator achieves a
throughput up to 108 times greater than that of a conventional DCNN
accelerator. In addition, our SR system achieves an energy efficiency of 144.9
GOPS/W, 293.0 GOPS/W, and 500.2 GOPS/W at SR scale factors of 2, 3, and 4,
respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our system can restore HR images

class of service systems with correlated service times. The classical $M^X/G/1$
queue with semi-Markov service times is the most prominent example in this
class and serves as a vehicle to display our results. The sequence of service
times is governed by a modulating process $J(t)$. The state of $J(\cdot)$ at a
service initiation time determines the joint distribution of the subsequent
service duration and the state of $J(\cdot)$ at the next service initiation.
  Several earlier works have imposed technical conditions, on the zeros of a
matrix determinant arising in the analysis, that are required in the
computation of the stationary queue length probabilities. The imposed
conditions in several of these articles are difficult or impossible to verify.
Without such assumptions, we determine both the transient and the steady-state
joint distribution of the number of customers immediately after a departure and
the state of the process $J(t)$ at the start of the next service.
  We numerically investigate how the mean queue length is affected by
variability in the number of customers that arrive during a single service
time. Our main observations here are that increasing variability may {\em
reduce} the mean queue length, and that the Markovian dependence of service
times can lead to large queue lengths, even if the system is not in heavy
traffic.

capable of providing both high contrast and high resolution of optical and
UltraSound (US) imaging. When a short duration laser pulse illuminates the
tissue as a target of imaging, tissue induces US waves and detected waves can
be used to reconstruct optical absorption distribution. Since receiving part of
PA consists of US waves, a large number of beamforming algorithms in US imaging
can be applied on PA imaging. Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most common
beamforming algorithm in US imaging. However, make use of DAS beamformer leads
to low resolution images and large scale of off-axis signals contribution. To
address these problems a new paradigm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS),
which was used as a reconstruction algorithm in confocal microwave imaging for
breast cancer detection, was introduced for US imaging. Consequently, DMAS was
used in PA imaging systems and it was shown this algorithm results in
resolution enhancement and sidelobe degrading. However, in presence of high
level of noise the reconstructed image still suffers from high contribution of
noise. In this paper, a modified version of DMAS beamforming algorithm is
proposed based on DAS inside DMAS formula expansion. The quantitative and
qualitative results show that proposed method results in more noise reduction
and resolution enhancement in expense of contrast degrading. For the
simulation, two-point target, along with lateral variation in two depths of
imaging are employed and it is evaluated under high level of noise in imaging
medium. Proposed algorithm in compare to DMAS, results in reduction of lateral
valley for about 19 dB followed by more distinguished two-point target.
Moreover, levels of sidelobe are reduced for about 25 dB.

grown to predict all the unknown parameters with uncertainties of about a few

Six different system configurations were defined to cover most of the band
within (292-356) GHz; as a consequence we detected a forest of lines towards
the central core. A total of 70 lines of $A/E$-CH$_3$OH and $A/E$-CH$_3$CN were
analysed, including torsionally excited transitions of CH$_3$OH ($\nu_t$=1). In
a search for all the isotopologues, we identified transitions of
$^{13}$CH$_3$OH. The physical conditions were derived considering collisional
and radiative processes. We found common temperatures for each $A$ and $E$
symmetry of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN; the derived column densities indicate an
$A/E$ equilibrated ratio for both tracers. The results reveal that CH$_3$CN and
CH$_3$OH trace a hot and cold component with $T_k \sim$ 141 K and $T_k \sim$ 74

that the emission region is compact ($\lesssim$ 5.5 arcsec) with gas density
$n$(H$_2$)=(0.7-1) $\times$ 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. The CH$_3$OH/CH$_3$CN abundance

high-order polynomials to accurately approximate and compensate for the

of PAs in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. There is more
than one candidate precoding matrix in a massive MIMO system because of the

paper proposes a low-order DPD method achieved by exploiting massive DoFs of
next-generation front ends. We propose a novel indirect learning structure

hidden sentence representations. The representations change significantly when
translation and part-of-speech decoders are added. The more decoders a model
employs, the better it clusters sentences according to their syntactic
similarity, as the representation space becomes less entangled. We explore the
structure of the representation space by interpolating between sentences, which
yields interesting pseudo-English sentences, many of which have recognizable
syntactic structure. Lastly, we point out an interesting property of our
models: The difference-vector between two sentences can be added to change a
third sentence with similar features in a meaningful way.

As far as we know, the pair consists of a rapidly rotating G-type star and a
hot star, which is responsible for the ionization of the nebula. The rotation
period of the G-type star is 5.95 days and the orbital period of the binary is
now known to be $\sim$2700 days, one of the longest in central star of
planetary nebulae. The spectrum of the G central star shows a complex H$\alpha$
double-peaked profile which varies with very short time scales, also reported
in other central stars of planetary nebulae and whose origin is still unknown.
We present new radial velocity observations of the central star which allow us
to confirm the orbital period for the long-period binary and discuss the
possibility of a third component in the system at $\sim$129 days to the G star.
This is complemented with the analysis of archival light curves from SuperWASP,

some standard distribution namely Lorenz distribution. The effects of variation
of $f$ and phase frustration parameter $\alpha$ on transition to
synchronization are investigated in detail. Self-consistent equations involving
critical coupling strength ($\lambda_c$) and group angular velocity
($\Omega_c$) at the onset of synchronization have been derived analytically in
the thermodynamic limit. For the detailed investigation we considered SK model
on scale-free as well as Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks. Interestingly
explosive synchronization (ES) has been observed in both the networks for
different ranges of values of $\alpha$ and $f$. For scale-free networks, as the
value of $f$ is set within $10\% \leq f \leq 70\%$, the range of the values of
$\alpha$ for existence of the ES is greatly enhanced compared to the fully
degree-frequency correlated case. On the other hand, for random networks, ES
observed in a narrow window of $\alpha$ when the value of $f$ is taken within
$30\% \leq f \leq 50\%$. In all the cases critical coupling strengths for
transition to synchronization computed from the analytically derived
self-consistent equations show a very good agreement with the numerical

binaries in the literature, there is no fully consistent model available that
can explain every observed property of this system.
  Aims. Our motivation is to obtain new spectra along with photometric
measurements, to analyze what kind of changes may have happened in the system
in the past two decades, and to propose new ideas for explaining them.
  Methods. For the period analysis we determined 10 new times of minima from
our light curves, and constructed a new O$-$C diagram of the system. Radial
velocities of the components were determined using the cross-correlation
technique. The light curves and radial velocities were modelled simultaneously
with the PHOEBE code. All observed spectra were compared to synthetic spectra
and equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$ line were measured on their differences.
  Results. We have re-determined the physical parameters of the system
according to our new light curve and spectral models. We confirm that the
primary component is more active than the secondary, and there is a correlation
between spottedness and the chromospheric activity. We propose that flip-flop
phenomenon occurring on the primary component could be a possible explanation
of the observed nature of the activity. To explain the period variation of VW
Cep, we test two previously suggested scenarios: presence of a fourth body in
the system, and the Applegate-mechanism caused by periodic magnetic activity.
We conclude that although none of these mechanisms can be ruled out entirely,
the available data suggest that mass transfer with a slowly decreasing rate
gives the most likely explanation for the period variation of VW Cep.

observations lasting 7000-12000 periods, between frequency range of 306 and 339

phase variations across the pulse window. In two pulsars J0820$-$1350 and
J1720$-$2933 the phases changed steadily across the pulse window. The pulsar
J1034$-$3224 has five components. The leading component was very weak and was
barely detectable in our observations. The four trailing components showed the
presence of subpulse drifting. The phase variations changed in alternate
components with a reversal in the sign of the gradient. This phenomenon is
known as bi-drifting. The pulsar J1555$-$3134 showed the presence of two
distinct peak frequencies of comparable strengths in the fluctuation spectrum.
The two peaks did not appear to be harmonically related and were most likely a
result of different physical processes. Additionally, the long observations

subpulse drifting was largely constant with time but small fluctuations around

neural-field models, phenomenological coarse-grained descriptions of
neural-network dynamics. But it remains unclear how these insights can be
transferred to more biologically realistic networks of spiking neurons, where
individual neurons fire irregularly. Here, we employ mean-field theory to
reduce a microscopic model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with
distance-dependent connectivity to an effective neural-field model. In contrast
to existing phenomenological descriptions, the dynamics in this neural-field
model depends on the mean and the variance in the synaptic input, both
determining the amplitude and the temporal structure of the resulting effective
coupling kernel. For the neural-field model we employ liner stability analysis
to derive conditions for the existence of spatial and temporal oscillations and
wave trains, that is, temporally and spatially periodic traveling waves. We
first prove that wave trains cannot occur in a single homogeneous population of
neurons, irrespective of the form of distance dependence of the connection
probability. Compatible with the architecture of cortical neural networks, wave
trains emerge in two-population networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons
as a combination of delay-induced temporal oscillations and spatial
oscillations due to distance-dependent connectivity profiles. Finally, we
demonstrate quantitative agreement between predictions of the analytically
tractable neural-field model and numerical simulations of both networks of

outcome can be attributed to specific pathways via intermediate variables or
mediators. This requires identification of so-called path-specific effects.
These express how a change in exposure affects those intermediate variables
(along certain pathways), and how the resulting changes in those variables in
turn affect the outcome (along subsequent pathways). However, unlike
identification of total effects, adjustment for confounding is insufficient for
identification of path-specific effects because their magnitude is also
determined by the extent to which individuals who experience large exposure
effects on the mediator, tend to experience relatively small or large mediator
effects on the outcome. This chapter therefore provides an accessible review of
identification strategies under general nonparametric structural equation
models (with possibly unmeasured variables), which rule out certain such
dependencies. In particular, it is shown which path-specific effects can be
identified under such models, and how this can be done.

Using a decentralized navigation protocol, we investigate the relationship
between the structure of the connectomes of different species and their spatial
layout. As a navigation strategy, we use greedy routing where nearest
neighbors, in terms of geometric distance, are visited. We measure the fraction
of successful greedy paths and their length as compared to shortest paths in
the topology of connectomes. In Euclidean space, we find a striking difference
between the navigability properties of mammalian and non-mammalian species,
which implies the inability of Euclidean distances to fully explain the
structural organization of their connectomes. In contrast, we find that
hyperbolic space, the effective geometry of complex networks, provides almost
perfectly navigable maps of connectomes for all species, meaning that
hyperbolic distances are exceptionally congruent with the structure of
connectomes. Hyperbolic maps therefore offer a quantitative meaningful
representation of connectomes that suggests a new cartography of the brain
based on the combination of its connectivity with its effective geometry rather
than on its anatomy only. Hyperbolic maps also provide a universal framework to
study decentralized communication processes in connectomes of different species
and at different scales on an equal footing.

the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 has provided unprecedented
insight into a wide range of physical processes: heavy element synthesis via
the $r$-process; the production of relativistic ejecta; the equation of state
of neutron stars and the nature of the merger remnant; the binary coalescence
timescale; and a measurement of the Hubble constant via the ""standard siren""
technique. In detail, all of these results depend on the distance to the host
galaxy of the merger event, NGC4993. In this paper we measure the surface
brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance to NGC4993 in the F110W and F160W
passbands of the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared Channel on the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). For the preferred F110W passband we derive a distance modulus
of $m{-}M=33.05\pm0.08\pm0.10$ mag, or a linear distance $d=40.7\pm1.4\pm1.9$
Mpc (random and systematic errors, respectively); a virtually identical result
is obtained from the F160W data. This is the most precise distance to NGC4993
available to date. Combining our distance measurement with the corrected
recession velocity of NGC4993 implies a Hubble constant $H_0=71.9\pm
7.1~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$. A comparison of our result to the GW-inferred value of
$H_0$ indicates a binary orbital inclination of $i\,{\gtrsim}\,137~\deg$. The
SBF technique can be applied to early-type host galaxies of BNS mergers to
${\sim\,}100$ Mpc with HST and possibly as far as ${\sim\,}300$ Mpc with the
James Webb Space Telescope, thereby helping to break the inherent
distance-inclination degeneracy of the GW signals at distances where many
future BNS mergers are likely to be detected.

of weak forces, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), galaxy formation,
molecular cloud assembly, star formation, and stellar evolution. Without weak
interactions, neutrons no longer decay, and the universe emerges from its early
epochs with a mixture of protons, neutrons, deuterium, and helium. The
baryon-to-photon ratio must be smaller than the canonical value in our universe
to allow free nucleons to survive the BBN epoch without being incorporated into
heavier nuclei. At later times, the free neutrons readily combine with protons
to make deuterium in sufficiently dense parts of the interstellar medium, and
provide a power source before they are incorporated into stars. Almost all of
the neutrons are incorporated into deuterium nuclei before stars are formed. As
a result, stellar evolution proceeds primarily through strong interactions,
with deuterium first burning into helium, and then helium fusing into carbon.
Low-mass deuterium-burning stars can be long-lived, and higher mass stars can
synthesize the heavier elements necessary for life. Although somewhat different
from our own, such universes remain potentially habitable.

dynamics that resembles a rogue wave on the FPUT lattice. We also show that
Gaussian initial data can lead to dynamics featuring rogue wave for
sufficiently wide Gaussians. The second example is a diatomic granular crystal
exhibiting rogue wave like dynamics, which we also obtain through an NLS
reduction and numerical simulations. The granular crystal (a chain of particles
that interact elastically) is a widely studied system that lends itself to
experimental studies. This study serves to illustrate the potential of such

conducting fluids with a strong mean magnetic field. We show that in the
presence of a strong helical forcing, the out-of-plane component ceases to
behave as a passive advected quantity and develops a nontrivial dynamics which
deeply changes its large-scale properties. We show that a small-scale helicity
injection correlates the input on the 2D component with the one on the
out-of-plane component. As a result, the third component develops a non-trivial
energy transfer. The latter is mediated by homochiral triads, confirming the
strong 3D nature of the leading dynamical interactions. In conclusion, we show
that the out-of-plane component in a 2D3C flow enjoys strong non-universal
properties as a function of the degree of mirror symmetry of the small-scale
forcing.

$b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ process is least beneficial for improving the precision
of the Higgs self-coupling (mainly set by the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ process).
We illustrate that the double Higgs production alone can be comparable to the
single Higgs process in constraining the modification of the top Yukawa

special interest, we derive the precision as a function of various improvable
parameters such as tag and mistag rates of tau leptons, heavy flavor jets,
photon identification, diphoton mass resolution, and jet energy resolution to
take into account future phenomenological studies. As an optimistic benchmark

(density and temperature) are directly drawn from the results of 3D radiative
hydrodynamical simulations. The disc evolution is taken into account within the

to the short orbital timescales in the circumplanetary disc. They form in
sequence, and many are lost into the planet due to fast type I migration,
polluting Jupiter's envelope with typically 15 Earth-masses of metals. The last
generation of moons can form very late in the evolution of the giant planet,
when the disc has already lost more than the 99% of its mass. The late
circumplanetary disc is cold enough to sustain water ice, hence not
surprisingly the 85% of the moon population has icy composition. The
distribution of the satellite-masses is peaking slightly above Galilean masses,
up until a few Earth-masses, in a regime which is observable with the current
instrumentation around Jupiter-analog exoplanets orbiting sufficiently close to
their host stars. We also find that systems with Galilean-like masses occur in
20% of the cases and they are more likely when discs have long dispersion

crucial to moving this field forward. Even though Bayesian methods are becoming
increasingly popular in nuclear theory, they are yet to be implemented and
applied in reaction theory problems. The purpose of this work is to
investigate, using Bayesian methods, the uncertainties in the optical
potentials generated from fits to elastic scattering data and the subsequent
uncertainties in the transfer predictions. We also study the differences in two
reaction models where the parameters are constrained in a similar manner, as
well as the impact of reducing the experimental error bars on the data used to
constrain the parameters. We use Bayes' Theorem combined with a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo to determine posterior distributions for the parameters of the
optical model, constrained by neutron-, proton-, and/or deuteron-target elastic
scattering. These potentials are then used to predict transfer cross sections
within the adiabatic wave approximation or the distorted-wave Born
approximation. We study a number of reactions involving deuteron projectiles
with energies in the range of $10-25$ MeV/u on targets with mass $A=48-208$.
The case of $^{48}$Ca(d,p)$^{49}$Ca transfer to the ground state is described
in detail. A comparative study of the effect of the size of experimental errors
is also performed. Five transfer reactions are studied, and their results
compiled in order to systematically identify trends. Uncertainties in transfer
cross sections can vary significantly (25-100\%) depending on the reaction.
While these uncertainties are reduced when smaller experimental error bars are
used to constrain the potentials, this reduction is not trivially related to
the error reduction. We also find smaller uncertainties when using the
adiabatic formulation than when using distorted-wave Born approximation.

exploring polarization of Type 1 AGNs. We model equatorial scattering using
flared-disk geometry for a set of different SMBH masses assuming Thomson
scattering. In addition to the Keplerian motion in the BLR, we also consider
cases of additional radial inflows and vertical outflows. We model the profiles
of polarization plane position angle, degree of polarization and total
unpolarized line for different BLR geometries and different SMBH masses. Our
modeling confirms that the method can be widely used for Type-1 AGNs when
viewing inclinations are between 25 and 45 degrees. We show that the distance
between the BLR and scattering region (SR) has a significant impact on the mass
estimates and the best mass estimates are when the SR is situated at the
distance 1.5-2.5 times larger than the outer BLR radius. Our models show that
if Keplerian motion can be traced through the polarized line profile, then the
direct estimation of the mass of the SMBH can be performed. When radial inflows

velocities of the inflow/outflow are less than 500 km/s. We find that models

moments of different orders cannot be simply related to each other which is the
signature of anomalous scaling, one of the most puzzling features of turbulent
flows. High-order moments are related to extreme, rare events and our ability
to quantitatively describe them is crucially important for meteorology, heat,
mass transfer and other applications. In this work we present a solution to
this problem in the particular case of the Navier-Stokes equations driven by a
random force. A novel aspect of this work is that, unlike previous efforts
which aimed at seeking solutions around the infinite Reynolds number limit, we
concentrate on the vicinity of transitional Reynolds numbers $Re^{tr}$ where
the first emergence of anomalous scaling is observed out of a low-$Re$ Gaussian
background. The obtained closed expressions for anomalous scaling exponents
$\zeta_{n}$ and $d_{n}$, which depend on the transition Reynolds number, agree
well with experimental and numerical data in the literature and, when $n\gg 1$,
$d_{n}\approx 0.19n \ln(n)$. The theory yields the energy spectrum $E(k)\propto
k^{-\zeta_{2}-1}$ with $\zeta_{2}\approx 0.699$, different from the outcome of
Kolmogorov's theory. It is also argued that fluctuations of dissipation rate

hierarchical galaxy formation, but their dynamical evolution at sub-parsec
scales is poorly understood, due to a combination of uncertainties in
theoretical models and lack of firm observational evidence. In gas rich
environments, it has been shown that a putative extended, steady circumbinary
gaseous disc plays an important role in the MBHB evolution, facilitating its
coalescence. How gas on galactic scales is transported to the nuclear region to
form and maintain such a stable structure is, however, unclear. If, following a
galaxy merger, turbulent gas is condenses in cold clumps and filaments that are
randomly scattered, gas is naturally transported on parsec scales and interacts
with the MBHB in discrete incoherent pockets. The aim of this work is to
investigate the gaseous structures arising from this interaction. We employ a
suite of smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations to study the formation and
evolution of gaseous structures around a MBHB constantly perturbed by the
incoherent infall of molecular clouds. We investigate the influence of the
infall rate and angular momentum distribution of the clouds on the geometry and
stability of the arising structures. We find that the continuous supply of
incoherent clouds is a double-edge sword, resulting in the intermittent
formation and disruption of circumbinary structures. Anisotropic cloud
distributions featuring an excess of co-rotating events generate more prominent
co-rotating circumbinary discs. Similar structures are seen when mostly
counter-rotating clouds are fed to the binary, even though they are more
compact and less stable. In general, our simulations do not show the formation
of extended smooth and stable circumbinary discs, typically assumed in
analytical and numerical investigations of the the long term evolution of
MBHBs. (Abridged)

silicon detectors (known as the ""E"" detectors) in the High Resolution Array
(HiRA) are investigated: the thickness of the dead layer on the front of the
detector, and the overall thickness of the detector itself. The dead layer
thickness for each E detector in HiRA is extracted using a measurement of alpha
particles emitted from a $^{212}$Pb pin source placed close to the detector
surface. This procedure also allows for energy calibrations of the E detectors,
which are otherwise inaccessible for alpha source calibration as each one is
sandwiched between two other detectors. The E detector thickness is obtained
from a combination of elastically scattered protons and an energy-loss
calculation method. Results from these analyses agree with values provided by

nuclear matter in the presence of strong magnetic fields, are investigated
using a chiral effective model. The medium modifications of these open bottom
mesons arise due to their interactions with the scalar mesons and the nucleons.
In the magnetized nuclear matter, the proton has contributions from the Landau
levels. In the chiral effective model, the masses of the $B$ and $\bar B$ are
calculated from the leading term, namely the vectorial Weinberg Tomozawa term
as well as from the next to leading order contributions, i.e., due to the
scalar exchange and the range terms. Due to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term, the
$\bar B$ mesons experience an attractive interaction in the symmetric nuclear
matter, whereas the $B$ mesons have a repulsive interaction. Inclusion of the
contributions from the scalar exchange and the range terms as well, leads to
drop of the masses of both $B$ and $\bar B$ mesons. The effect of the isospin
asymmetry breaks the mass degeneracy of the $B^+$ and $B^0$ (as well as of the
$B^-$ and $\bar {B^0}$) mesons, and its effect is observed to be large at high
densities. The effects of anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons are taken
into account in the present study of the masses of the open bottom mesons in

widely used in inference for computing marginal distributions efficiently.
Depending on how the factorization of the underlying joint Gaussian
distribution is performed, GBP may exhibit different convergence properties as
different factorizations may lead to fundamentally different recursive update
structures. In this paper, we study the convergence of GBP derived from the
factorization based on the distributed linear Gaussian model. The motivation is
twofold. From the factorization viewpoint, i.e., by specifically employing a
factorization based on the linear Gaussian model, in some cases, we are able to
bypass difficulties that exist in other convergence analysis methods that use a
different (Gaussian Markov random field) factorization. From the distributed
inference viewpoint, the linear Gaussian model readily conforms to the physical
network topology arising in large-scale networks, and, is practically useful.
For the distributed linear Gaussian model, under mild assumptions, we show
analytically three main results: the GBP message inverse variance converges
exponentially fast to a unique positive limit for arbitrary nonnegative
initialization; we provide a necessary and sufficient convergence condition for
the belief mean to converge to the optimal value; and, when the underlying
factor graph is given by the union of a forest and a single loop, we show that
GBP always converges.

is thus an important challenge for urban planing, civil engineering and
transportation. Those maps are traditionally created manually, which represents
a massive amount of work, and may discard recent or temporary changes. For
these reasons, automated map building has been a long time goal, either for
road network reconstruction or for local road surface reconstruction from low
level observations. In this work, we navigate between these two goals. Starting
from an approximate road axis (+ width) network as a simple road modelling, we
propose to use observations of street features and optimisation to improve the
coarse model. Observations are generic, and as such, can be derived from
various data, such as aerial images, street images and street Lidar, other GIS
data, and complementary user input.
  Starting from an initial road modelling which is at a median distance of 1.5
metre from the sidewalk ground-truth, our method has the potential to robustly
optimise the road modelling so the median distance reaches 0.45 metre fully
automatically, with better results possible using user inputs and/or more
precise observations. The robust non linear least square optimisation used is
extremely fast, with computing time from few minutes (whole Paris) to less than
a second for a few blocks.
  The proposed approach is simple, very fast and produces a credible road
model. These promising results open the way to various applications, such as
integration in an interactive framework, or integration in a more powerful
optimisation method, which would be able to further segment road network and
use more complex road model.

essence similar to the situation encountered in the reduced three-body problem

magnetic field is impossible for axisymmetric force fields in source-free
regions because in this case the effective potential does not possess any local

the classical problem of a rotating, aligned magnetosphere. By analyzing the
dynamics of halo and equatorial particle orbits we conclude that axisymmetric
toroidal fields that are antisymmetric about the equator are unable to provide
gyroscopic stabilization. On the other hand, a toroidal magnetic field that
does not vanish at the equator can provide gyroscopic stabilization for

all learn a mapping from decompressed patches to the original counterparts
under the ubiquitous $\ell_\infty$ metric. However, this approach is incapable
of restoring distinctive image details which may be statistical outliers but
have high semantic importance (e.g., tiny lesions in medical images). To
overcome this weakness, we propose to incorporate an $\ell_\infty$ fidelity
criterion in the design of neural network so that no small, distinctive

results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in $\ell_\infty$ error metric and perceptual quality, while being
competitive in $\ell_2$ error metric as well. It can restore subtle image

algorithm development in this paper. Six months of driving information from the
city of Ann Arbor is collected from 2,000 vehicles. The road grade information
from more than 1,100 km of road network is modeled and the software Autonomie
is used to calculate fuel consumption for all trips on the road network. Four
different routing strategies including shortest distance, shortest time,
eco-routing, and travel-time-constrained eco-routing are compared. The results
show that eco-routing can reduce fuel consumption, but may increase travel
time. A travel-time-constrained eco-routing algorithm is developed to keep most
the fuel saving benefit while incurring very little increase in travel time.

induced particle creation scenario in the framework of DGP braneworld model.
For this purpose, we consider apparent horizon as the boundary of the universe.
We take three types of entropy such as Bakenstein entropy, logarithmic
corrected entropy and power law corrected entropy with ordinary creation rate
$\Gamma$. We analyze the first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics
analytically for these entropies which hold under some constraints. The
behavior of total entropy in each case is also discussed which implies the
validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics. Also, we check the
thermodynamical equilibrium condition for two phases of creation rate, that is
constant and variable $\Gamma$ and found its validity in all cases of entropy.

challenging problem. As one of the most informative expressions, smiles convey
basic underlying emotions, such as happiness and satisfaction, which lead to
multiple applications, e.g., human behavior analysis and interactive
controlling. Compared to the size of databases for face recognition, far less
labeled data is available for training smile detection systems. To leverage the
large amount of labeled data from face recognition datasets and to alleviate
overfitting on smile detection, an efficient transfer learning-based smile
detection approach is proposed in this paper. Unlike previous works which use
either hand-engineered features or train deep convolutional networks from
scratch, a well-trained deep face recognition model is explored and fine-tuned
for smile detection in the wild. Three different models are built as a result
of fine-tuning the face recognition model with different inputs, including
aligned, unaligned and grayscale images generated from the GENKI-4K dataset.
Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves improved state-of-the-art
performance. Robustness of the model to noise and blur artifacts is also
evaluated in this paper.

  Events",,,,,"eess.SP cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the risks of large-scale geologic carbon sequestration is the
potential migration of fluids out of the storage formations. Accurate and fast
detection of this fluids migration is not only important but also challenging,
due to the large subsurface uncertainty and complex governing physics.
Traditional leakage detection and monitoring techniques rely on geophysical
observations including seismic. However, the resulting accuracy of these
methods is limited because of indirect information they provide requiring
expert interpretation, therefore yielding in-accurate estimates of leakage
rates and locations. In this work, we develop a novel machine-learning
detection package, named ""Seismic-Net"", which is based on the deep densely
connected neural network. To validate the performance of our proposed leakage
detection method, we employ our method to a natural analog site at Chimay\'o,
New Mexico. The seismic events in the data sets are generated because of the
eruptions of geysers, which is due to the leakage of $\mathrm{CO}_\mathrm{2}$.
In particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of our Seismic-Net by formulating
our detection problem as an event detection problem with time series data. A
fixed-length window is slid throughout the time series data and we build a deep
densely connected network to classify each window to determine if a geyser
event is included. Through our numerical tests, we show that our model achieves
precision/recall as high as 0.889/0.923. Therefore, our Seismic-Net has a great
potential for detection of $\mathrm{CO}_\mathrm{2}$ leakage.

tumors. The accurate segmentation of subcortical brain structures is crucial to
the study of gliomas in that it helps the monitoring of the progression of
gliomas and aids the evaluation of treatment outcomes. However, the large
amount of required human labor makes it difficult to obtain the manually
segmented Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, limiting the use of precise
quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. In this work, we try to
address this problem by developing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network~(3D CNN)
based model to automatically segment gliomas. The major difficulty of our
segmentation model comes with the fact that the location, structure, and shape
of gliomas vary significantly among different patients. In order to accurately
classify each voxel, our model captures multi-scale contextual information by
extracting features from two scales of receptive fields. To fully exploit the
tumor structure, we propose a novel architecture that hierarchically segments
different lesion regions of the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor~(NCR/NET),
peritumoral edema~(ED) and GD-enhancing tumor~(ET). Additionally, we utilize
densely connected convolutional blocks to further boost the performance. We
train our model with a patch-wise training schema to mitigate the class
imbalance problem. The proposed method is validated on the BraTS 2017 dataset
and it achieves Dice scores of 0.72, 0.83 and 0.81 for the complete tumor,
tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. These results are comparable to
the reported state-of-the-art results, and our method is better than existing
3D-based methods in terms of compactness, time and space efficiency.

considered. Apart from bound state eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, expectation
values, quite accurate estimates of the critical cage radius for H atom for all
the 55 states corresponding to $n \leq 10$, are also examined. Some of the
latter are better than previously reported values. Degeneracy and energy
ordering under the isotropic confinement situation are discussed as well. The

With increased population and complex roles regarding their inhabitants and
their surroundings, cities concentrate difficulties for design, planning and
analysis. These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally,
much attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential
part of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom
researched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a
unique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing
the recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by
considering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for
city models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse
which data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street
reconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features
reconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects
reconstruction/modelling.
  Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role
the model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse
procedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to
come from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of
the available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and
to their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural
modelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the
reconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.
