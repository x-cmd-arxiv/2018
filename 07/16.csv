inequalities by non-separable spin-orbit laser modes. Qubits are encoded on
polarization and transverse modes of an intense laser beam. A spin-orbit
non-separable mode was produced by means of a radial polarization converter
(S-plate). The results show that contextuality can be investigated by using
spin-orbit modes in a simple way, corroborating recent works stating that such
system can emulate single-photon experiments. Additionally, an improvement in
the non-separable mode preparation allowed us to observe a greater violation of
the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for such system. The results are in
very good agreement with the theoretical predictions of quantum mechanics.

and/or sufficient conditions for the exactness of parametric penalty functions,
and for the zero duality gap property to hold true for these functions. We also
prove some convergence results for the method of parametric penalty functions,
and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a parametric penalty
function to not have any stationary points outside the set of feasible points
of the constrained optimization problem under consideration. In the second part
of the paper, we apply the general theory of exact parametric penalty functions

martingale $M$ with values in a UMD Banach space $X$. Assuming that $M_0=0$, we
show that the following two-sided inequality holds for all $1\leq p<\infty$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:main}\tag{{$\star$}}
  \mathbb E \sup_{0\leq s\leq t} \|M_s\|^p \eqsim_{p, X} \mathbb E
\gamma([\![M]\!]_t)^p ,\;\;\; t\geq 0. \end{align} Here $ \gamma([\![M]\!]_t) $
is the $L^2$-norm of the unique Gaussian measure on $X$ having
$[\![M]\!]_t(x^*,y^*):= [\langle M,x^*\rangle, \langle M,y^*\rangle]_t$ as its
covariance bilinear form. This extends to general UMD spaces a recent result by
Veraar and the author, where a pointwise version of \eqref{eq:main} was proved
for UMD Banach functions spaces $X$.
  We show that for continuous martingales, \eqref{eq:main} holds for all
$0<p<\infty$, and that for purely discontinuous martingales the right-hand side
of \eqref{eq:main} can be expressed more explicitly in terms of the jumps of
$M$. For martingales with independent increments, \eqref{eq:main} is shown to
hold more generally in reflexive Banach spaces $X$ with finite cotype. In the
converse direction, we show that the validity of \eqref{eq:main} for arbitrary
martingales implies the UMD property for $X$.
  As an application we prove various It\^o isomorphisms for vector-valued
stochastic integrals with respect to general martingales, which extends earlier
results by van Neerven, Veraar, and Weis for vector-valued stochastic integrals
with respect to a Brownian motion. We also provide It\^o isomorphisms for

derive interesting results based on an interpretation of the traditional
eigenvalue problem. More specifically, we reduce the dimensionality of our
matrices but increase the power of the characteristic polynomial, i.e, a
polynomial eigenvalue problem. Such an approach may sound counterintuitive at
first glance, but it allows us to relate the quadratic problem for a 2-Layer
multiplex system with the spectra of the aggregated network and to derive
bounds for the spectra, among many other interesting analytical insights.
Furthermore, it also permits to directly obtain analytical and numerical
insights on the eigenvalue behavior as a function of the coupling between
layers. Our study includes the supra-adjacency, supra-Laplacian, and the
probability transition matrices, which enable us to put our results under the
perspective of structural phases in multiplex networks. We believe that this

  the Analysis of Diffusion MRI",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparse dictionary learning is a popular method for representing signals as
linear combinations of a few elements from a dictionary that is learned from
the data. In the classical setting, signals are represented as vectors and the
dictionary learning problem is posed as a matrix factorization problem where
the data matrix is approximately factorized into a dictionary matrix and a
sparse matrix of coefficients. However, in many applications in computer vision
and medical imaging, signals are better represented as matrices or tensors
(e.g. images or videos), where it may be beneficial to exploit the
multi-dimensional structure of the data to learn a more compact representation.
One such approach is separable dictionary learning, where one learns separate
dictionaries for different dimensions of the data. However, typical
formulations involve solving a non-convex optimization problem; thus
guaranteeing global optimality remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a
framework that builds upon recent developments in matrix factorization to
provide theoretical and numerical guarantees of global optimality for separable
dictionary learning. We propose an algorithm to find such a globally optimal
solution, which alternates between following local descent steps and checking a
certificate for global optimality. We illustrate our approach on diffusion
magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data, a medical imaging modality that
measures water diffusion along multiple angular directions in every voxel of an
MRI volume. State-of-the-art methods in dMRI either learn dictionaries only for
the angular domain of the signals or in some cases learn spatial and angular
dictionaries independently. In this work, we apply the proposed separable
dictionary learning framework to learn spatial and angular dMRI dictionaries
jointly and provide preliminary validation on denoising phantom and real dMRI
brain data.

QED bound states and of their applicability to QCD. The power series in

expansion of the bound state in temporal gauge ($A^0=0$). Gauss' constraint on
physical states fixes the gauge for time independent transformations and
determines the instantaneous interaction within each Fock state.
  Positronium atoms generate a classical (dipole) electric field, whereas there
can be no color octet gluon field for color singlet hadrons. Hence the gluon
field generated by each color component of a hadron need not vanish at spatial
infinity. Gauss' constraint has a homogeneous solution with a single parameter
$\Lambda$ that is compatible with Poincar\'e invariance. The corresponding
potential is linear for $q\bar q$ and $gg$ Fock states, and confining also for
other states ($q\bar qg,\,qqq$).
  This approach is consistent with the quarkonium phenomenology based on the
Cornell potential at lowest order. The relativistic meson and glueball
eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian with the $O(\alpha_s^0)$ linear potential
are determined. The states lie on linear Regge trajectories and their
daughters. There are also massless bound states which allow to include a

yet weaker than those appearing in non-signaling models, still poses many
riddles. In this work we show that the extent of binary correlations in a
general class of nonlocal theories can be characterized by the~existence of a
certain covariance matrix. The set of quantum realizable two-point correlators
in the~bipartite case then arises from a subtle restriction on the structure of
this general covariance matrix. We also identify a class of theories whose
covariance does not have neither a quantum nor an ""almost quantum"" origin, but
which nevertheless produce the accessible two-point quantum mechanical
correlators. Our approach leads to richer Bell-type inequalities in which the
extent of nonlocality is intimately related to a non-additive entropic measure.
In particular, it suggests that the Tsallis entropy with parameter q=1/2 is a
natural operational measure of non-classicality. Moreover, when~generalizing
this covariance matrix we find novel characterizations of the quantum
mechanical set of correlators in multipartite scenarios. All these predictions
might be experimentally validated when adding weak measurements to the

$\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^4)$ for a strangeness neutral system by performing a Taylor
expansion of chiral observables in temperature $T$ and chemical potentials
$\mu$. At vanishing chemical potential, we report a crossover temperature
$T_c(0) = (156.5 \pm 1.5)\;\mathrm{MeV}$ defined by the average of several
second-order chiral susceptibilities. For a system with thermal conditions
appropriate for a heavy-ion collision, we determined a curvature from the
subtracted condensate as $\kappa_2 = 0.0120(20)$ and from the disconnected
susceptibility as $\kappa_2 = 0.0123(30)$. The next order $\kappa_4$ is
significantly smaller. We also report the crossover temperature as a function
of the chemical potentials for: baryon-number, electric charge, strangeness and
isospin. Additionally, we find that $T_c(\mu_B)$ is in agreement with lines of
constant energy density and constant entropy density. Along this crossover
line, we study net baryon-number fluctuations and show that their increase is
substantially smaller compared to that obtained in HRG model calculations.
Similarly, we analyze chiral susceptibility fluctuations along the crossover
line and show that these are constant. We conclude that no signs for a
narrowing of the crossover region can be found for baryon chemical potential
$\mu_B < 250\;\mathrm{MeV}$.

a unique single-letter and additive quantity, the thermodynamic capacity, that

the work required to simulate many repetitions of a quantum process employing
many repetitions of another quantum process becomes equal to the difference of

asymptotically optimal constructions of universal implementations of quantum

to coherently combine thermal engines that would run in different thermodynamic

Shannon theory by providing a generalized notion of quantum typical subspaces

black hole magnetosphere was rarely discussed, since previous studies have been
focused on the field lines entering the horizon. However, recent high-accuracy
force-free electrodynamics (FFE) simulations \cite{East2018} show that there
are both field lines entering the horizon and field lines ending up on the
equatorial current sheet within the ergosphere for asymptotic uniform field
configuration. For the latter field lines, the equatorial boundary condition is
well approximated being marginally force-free, i.e., $B^2-E^2\approx 0$, where
$B$ and $E$ are the magnetic and electric field strength, respectively. In this
paper, we revisit the uniform field solution to the Kerr BH magnetosphere
structure and investigate the role of the marginally force-free equatorial
boundary condition. We find this boundary condition plays an important role in
shaping the BH magnetosphere in various aspects, including the shape of the
light surface, the near-horizon field line configuration and the source of the
Poynting flux. We also propose an algorithm for numerically solving the
Grad-Shafranov equation and self-consistently imposing the marginally
force-free equatorial condition. As a result, we find a good agreement between
our numerical solutions and the high-accuracy FFE simulations. We also discuss
the applicability of the marginally force-free boundary condition and the

antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions among the magnetic vanadium ions. The dc

characterized by the Vogel-Fulcher law and critical dynamic scaling behavior or

asymmetric response of the magnetic relaxation below $T_{f}$ supports the
hierarchical model. Heat capacity data show no long-range or short-range

waves, known as Kapitza waves. Surface waves are important to many industrial
applications. For example, liquid films with surface waves are employed to
remove heat from solid surfaces. The initial phase of the instability is
governed by the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and the appropriate boundary
conditions; therefore, the fast and accurate solution of this equation is
useful for industry. This paper presents a spectral method to solve the
Orr-Sommerfeld equation with free surface boundary conditions. Our numerical
approach is based on a Galerkin method with Chebyshev polynomials of the first
kind, making it possible to express the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and their
boundary conditions as a generalized eigenvalue problem. The main advantages of
the present spectral method when compared to others such as, for instance,
spectral collocation, are its stability and its readiness in including the
boundary conditions in the discretized equations. We compare our numerical
results with analytical solutions based on Perturbation Methods, which are
valid only for long wave instabilities, and show that the results agree in the
region of validity of the long-wave hypothesis. Far from this region, our
results are still valid. In addition, we compare our results with published

at finding hard-to-trigger software bugs. Most popular fuzzers use evolutionary
guidance to generate inputs that can trigger different bugs. Such evolutionary
algorithms, while fast and simple to implement, often get stuck in fruitless
sequences of random mutations. Gradient-guided optimization presents a
promising alternative to evolutionary guidance. Gradient-guided techniques have
been shown to significantly outperform evolutionary algorithms at solving
high-dimensional structured optimization problems in domains like machine
learning by efficiently utilizing gradients or higher-order derivatives of the
underlying function. However, gradient-guided approaches are not directly
applicable to fuzzing as real-world program behaviors contain many
discontinuities, plateaus, and ridges where the gradient-based methods often
get stuck. We observe that this problem can be addressed by creating a smooth
surrogate function approximating the discrete branching behavior of target

surrogate neural network models that can incrementally learn smooth
approximations of a complex, real-world program's branching behaviors. We
further demonstrate that such neural network models can be used together with
gradient-guided input generation schemes to significantly improve the fuzzing

that are organized to achieve gradients in porosity and pore size in the radial
direction to emulate cortical bone encapsulating cancellous bone. A diameter of
30mm and height of 10mm was designed to target the repair of critically sized
long bone defects. The compressive properties of these graft substitutes were
determined to be comparable to adult human femurs. Furthermore, dynamic fatigue
testing at twice the human torso weight (800N) indicated that the bone graft
substitute achieved stability as quickly as 200,000 cycles, suggesting its
ability to support weight bearing loads while it gradually degrades as bone
cells proliferate and mineralize. Additionally, the graft substitutes were
seeded with human fetal osteoblasts to validate homogenous cellular attachment
and cytocompatibility. Graft substitutes were also dynamically cultured for 28

differentiated osteoblasts, and these resulting tissue constructs were
subjected to fatigue testing. The frequency of loading during dynamic culturing

together, these bone graft substitutes have potential for use as orthopaedic

  conjecture of Ulam on the invariance of measure was proved in the affirmative

  Ulam's conjecture, whether the related sets are degenerate or non-degenerate.
  48 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A conjecture of Ulam states that the standard probability measure $\pi$ on
the Hilbert cube $I^\omega$ is invariant under the induced metric $d_a$ when
the sequence $a = \{ a_i \}$ of positive numbers satisfies the condition
$\sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty a_i^2 < \infty$. This conjecture was proved in
\cite{jung1} when $E_1$ is a non-degenerate subset of $M_a$. In this paper, we
prove the conjecture of Ulam completely by classifying cylinders as
non-degenerate and degenerate cylinders and by treating the degenerate case

computing, whose solutions have several applications. Intuitively, Consensus
should be no harder than Broadcast, and this can be rigorously established in
several models. Can Consensus be easier than Broadcast?
  In models that allow noiseless communication, we prove a reduction of (a
suitable variant of) Broadcast to binary Consensus, that preserves the
communication model and all complexity parameters such as randomness, number of
rounds, communication per round, etc., while there is a loss in the success
probability of the protocol. Using this reduction, we get, among other
applications, the first logarithmic lower bound on the number of rounds needed
to achieve Consensus in the uniform GOSSIP model on the complete graph. The
lower bound is tight and, in this model, Consensus and Broadcast are
equivalent.
  We then turn to distributed models with noisy communication channels that
have been studied in the context of some bio-inspired systems. In such models,
only one noisy bit is exchanged when a communication channel is established
between two nodes, and so one cannot easily simulate a noiseless protocol by
using error-correcting codes. An $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2} n)$ lower bound on the
number of rounds needed for Broadcast is proved by Boczkowski et al. [PLOS

parameter that measures the amount of noise). In such model, we prove a new
$\Theta(\epsilon^{-2} n \log n)$ bound for Broadcast and a
$\Theta(\epsilon^{-2} \log n)$ bound for binary Consensus, thus establishing an
exponential gap between the number of rounds necessary for Consensus versus

insect size decreases. For the smallest insects (wing length R below 1 mm), the
viscous effect is so large that lift-generation mechanisms used by their larger
counterparts become ineffective. How the weight-supporting vertical force is
generated is unknown. To elucidate the aerodynamic mechanisms responsible, we
measure the wing kinematics of the tiny wasp Encarsia formosa (0.6 mm R) in
hovering or very slow ascending flight and compute and analyze the aerodynamic
forces. We find that the insects perform two unusual wing-motions. One is
rowing: the wings move fast downward and backward, like stroking oars; the
other is the previously discovered Weis-Fogh fling. The rowing produces 70
percent of the required vertical force and the Weis-Fogh fling the other 30
percent. The oaring wing mainly produces an approximately up-pointing drag,
resulting in the vertical force. Because each oaring produces a starting flow,
the drag is unsteady in nature and much greater than that in steady motion at
the same velocities and angles of attack. Furthermore, our computation shows
that if the tiny wasps employed the usual wing kinematics of the larger insects
(flapping back and forth in a horizontal plane), vertical force produced would
be only one third of that by the real wing kinematics; i.e. they must use the
special wing movements to overcome the problem of large viscous effects
encountered by the commonly used flapping kinematics. We for the first time
observe very small insects using drag to support their weight and explain how a
net vertical force is generated when the drag principle is applied.

certain vanishing condition of some of its joint moments. In this approach
(which covers versions for both the classical CLT and the CLT of free
probability), the determination of the resulting limit law has to be addressed
on a case-by-case basis.
  In this paper we discuss an instance of the above theorem which takes place
in the framework of the group algebra of the infinite symmetric group
$S_{\infty}$: the exchangeable sequence that is considered consists of the
star-generators of $S_{\infty}$, and the expectation functional used on the
group algebra of $S_{\infty}$ depends in a natural way on a parameter $d$,
which is a positive integer. We identify precisely the limit distribution
$\mu_d$ for this special instance of exchangeable CLT, via a connection that
$\mu_d$ turns out to have with the average empirical eigenvalue distribution of
a random GUE matrix of size $d \times d$. Moreover, we put into evidence a
multi-variate version of this result which follows from the observation that,

on the two-dimensional phase space exactly. For more general cases, one has to
solve an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem. To avoid this difficulty, we
consider a finite dimensional approximation and estimate the errors for the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As an application, we address the so-called
Wigner approximation suggested by some of us for the propagation of a pulse in
a general dispersive medium. We prove that this approximation never leads to a

gravity. $E_G$, a statistic constructed from power spectrum estimates of both
weak lensing and redshift space distortions (RSD), directly tests general
relativity (GR) while in principle being independent of clustering bias. This
property has motivated its recent use in multiple tests of GR. Recent work has
suggested that the magnification bias of galaxies due to foreground matter
perturbations breaks the bias-independence of the $E_G$ statistic. The
magnitude of this effect is very sensitive to the clustering and magnification
biases of the galaxy sample. We show that for realistic values of the
clustering and magnification biases, the effect for magnification bias is small
relative to statistical errors for most spectroscopic galaxy surveys but large
for photometric galaxy surveys. For the cases with significant magnification
bias, we propose a method to calibrate magnification bias using measurements of
the lensing auto-power spectrum. We test this calibration method using
simulations, finding that our calibration method can calibrate $E_G$ from 2-4
times the simulation error to well within the errors, although its accuracy is
sensitive to the precision of the measured redshift distribution and
magnification bias, but not the clustering bias. This work gives strong
evidence that this method will work increasingly well in future CMB lensing
surveys.

in-medium scattering length which occurs well before the divergence of the
vacuum scattering length and the spinodal density. We also calculate the
pairing gap and show that non-local correlations can change the pairing gap by
almost an order of magnitude.

identify and represent invariant features across image sub-patches in an
unsupervised manner. (ii) We initialise our kernel learning with a layer-wise
pre-training scheme that leverages the sparsity inherent in medical images to
extract initial discriminative features. (iii) We adapt a multi-scale spatial
pyramid pooling (SPP) framework to capture subtle geometric differences between
learned visual features. We evaluated our framework in medical image retrieval
and classification on three public datasets. Our results show that our CSKN had
better accuracy when compared to other conventional unsupervised methods and
comparable accuracy to methods that used state-of-the-art supervised

unsupervised CSKN provides an opportunity to leverage unannotated big data in

are given by gradients of exponentially concave functions and prove two main
results. First, we show that the optimal transport is the large deviation limit
of a particle system of Dirichlet processes transporting one probability
measure on the unit simplex to another by coordinatewise multiplication and
normalizing. The structure of our Lagrangian and the appearance of the
Dirichlet process relate our problem closely to the entropic measure on the
Wasserstein space as defined by von-Renesse and Sturm in the context of
Wasserstein diffusion. The limiting procedure is a triangular limit where we
allow simultaneously the number of particles to grow to infinity while the
`noise' tends to zero. The method, which generalizes easily to many other cost
functions, including the squared Euclidean distance, provides a novel
combination of the Schr\""odinger problem approach due to C. L\'eonard and the
related Brownian particle systems by Adams et al.which does not require gamma
convergence. Second, we analyze the behavior of entropy along the paths of
transport. The reference measure on the simplex is taken to be the Dirichlet
measure with all zero parameters which relates to the finite-dimensional
distributions of the entropic measure. The interpolating curves are not the
usual McCann lines. Nevertheless we show that entropy plus a multiple of the
transport cost remains convex, which is reminiscent of the semiconvexity of
entropy along lines of McCann interpolations in negative curvature spaces. We
also obtain, under suitable conditions, dimension-free bounds of the optimal
transport cost in terms of entropy.

of constraints which enforce the local solution to have mean value one on the

cones on boundary points of sliding minimal surfaces. In particular we studied
cones contained in an half-space and whose boundary can slide along the
bounding hyperplane. After giving a classification of one-dimensional minimal
cones in the half-plane we provided four new two-dimensional minimal cones in
the three-dimensional half space (which cannot be obtained as the Cartesian
product of the real line with one of the previous cones). We employed the
technique of paired calibrations and in one case could also generalise it to
higher dimension. In order to prove that the provided list of minimal cones is
complete, we started the classification of cones satisfying the necessary
conditions for the minimality, and with numeric simulations we obtained better
competitors for these new candidates

PLS-complete problems. An instinctive approach to finding such a locally
optimum solution is the FLIP method. Even though FLIP requires exponential time
in worst-case instances, it tends to terminate quickly in practical instances.
To explain this discrepancy, the run-time of FLIP has been studied in the
smoothed complexity framework. Etscheid and R\""{o}glin showed that the smoothed
complexity of FLIP for max-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial. Angel,
Bubeck, Peres, and Wei showed that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-cut
in complete graphs is $O(\phi^5n^{15.1})$, where $\phi$ is an upper bound on
the random edge-weight density and $n$ is the number of vertices in the input
graph.
  While Angel et al.'s result showed the first polynomial smoothed complexity,
they also conjectured that their run-time bound is far from optimal. In this
work, we make substantial progress towards improving the run-time bound. We
prove that the smoothed complexity of FLIP in complete graphs is $O(\phi
n^{7.83})$. Our results are based on a carefully chosen matrix whose rank
captures the run-time of the method along with improved rank bounds for this
matrix and an improved union bound based on this matrix. In addition, our
techniques provide a general framework for analyzing FLIP in the smoothed
framework. We illustrate this general framework by showing that the smoothed
complexity of FLIP for max-$3$-cut in complete graphs is polynomial and for
max-$k$-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial. We believe that our
techniques should also be of interest towards addressing the smoothed
complexity of FLIP for max-$k$-cut in complete graphs for larger constants $k$.

have been a lot of researches based on the time series of the wind power or
speed, but In fact, these time series cannot express the temporal and spatial
changes of wind, which fundamentally hinders the advance of wind power
prediction. In this paper, a new kind of feature that can describe the process
of temporal and spatial variation is proposed, namely, Spatio-Temporal
Features. We first map the data collected at each moment from the wind turbine
to the plane to form the state map, namely, the scene, according to the
relative positions. The scene time series over a period of time is a
multi-channel image, i.e. the Spatio-Temporal Features. Based on the
Spatio-Temporal Features, the deep convolutional network is applied to predict
the wind power, achieving a far better accuracy than the existing methods.
Compared with the starge-of-the-art method, the mean-square error (MSE) in our
method is reduced by 49.83%, and the average time cost for training models can
be shortened by a factor of more than 150.

does not utilize knowledge of NGC 4993 as the unique host galaxy of the optical
counterpart to GW170817. Instead, we consider each galaxy within the GW170817
localization region as a potential host; combining the redshift from each
galaxy with the distance estimate from GW170817 provides an estimate of the
Hubble constant, $H_0$. We then combine the $H_0$ values from all the galaxies
to provide a final measurement of $H_0$. We explore the dependence of our
results on the thresholds by which galaxies are included in our sample, as well
as the impact of weighting the galaxies by stellar mass and star-formation
rate. Considering all galaxies brighter than $0.01 L^\star_B$ as equally likely
to host a BNS merger, we find $H_0= 76^{+48}_{-23}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
(maximum a posteriori and 68.3% highest density posterior interval; assuming a
flat $H_0$ prior in the range $\left[ 10, 220 \right]$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$).
Restricting only to galaxies brighter than $0.626 L^\star_B$ tightens the
measurement to $H_0= 77^{+37}_{-18}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We show that
weighting the host galaxies by stellar mass or star-formation rate provides
entirely consistent results with potentially tighter constraints. While these
statistical estimates are inferior to the value from the counterpart standard
siren measurement utilizing NGC 4993 as the unique host, $H_0=76^{+19}_{-13}$
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (determined from the same publicly available data), our
analysis is a proof-of-principle demonstration of the statistical approach
first proposed by Bernard Schutz over 30 years ago.

Using a simple model, we estimate the contribution of ice-albedo feedback to
the mean temperature increase in the SH to be 0.5 +/- 0.1 K in the years 1955

derive a direct warming of only 0.2 +/- 0.05 K in the same period. These
numbers are in nice accordance with the reported mean temperature rise of 0.75
+/- 0.1 K of the SH in 2015 since 1955 (and relative to 1880). Our data also
confirm previously noticed correlations between the annual fluctuations of
solar intensity and El Nino observations on the one hand and the annual
variability of the SH surface temperature on the other hand. Our calculations
indicate a slowing down of the temperature increase during the past few years

magnitude the amount of data to be collected by the LHC experiments. The
foreseen gradual increase of the instantaneous luminosity of up to more than
twice its nominal value of $10\times10^{34}\ {\rm cm}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-2}$ during
Phase I and Phase II of the LHC running, presents special challenges for the
experiments. The region with high pseudo rapidity ($\eta$) region of the
forward muon spectrometer ($2.4 > |\eta| > 1.9$) is not equipped with RPC
stations. The increase of the expected particles rate up to 2 kHz cm$^{-1}$ (
including a safety factor 3 ) motivates the installation of RPC chambers to
guarantee redundancy with the CSC chambers already present. The current CMS RPC
technology cannot sustain the expected background level. A new generation of
Glass-RPC (GRPC) using low-resistivity glass was proposed to equip the two most
far away of the four high $\eta$ muon stations of CMS. In their single-gap
version they can stand rates of few kHz cm$^{-1}$. Their time precision of
about 1 ns can allow to reduce the noise contribution leading to an improvement
of the trigger rate. The proposed design for large size chambers is examined
and some preliminary results obtained during beam tests at Gamma Irradiation
Facility (GIF++) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN are shown. They
were performed to validate the capability of such detectors to support high

generally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force
measurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same

difference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a
form of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct

Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory allows one to separate true contextuality
from direct influences in the overall context-dependence. The CbD analysis of
numerous previous attempts to demonstrate contextuality in human judgments
shows that all context-dependence in them can be accounted for by direct

phases. Here we explore the dynamics of a two-component condensate coupled to a
finesse cavity, in which the Raman coupling is mediated by pumping laser and
cavity mode. In this model, the energy scale of cavity mode is several order of
magnitude bigger than that in the condensate, thus the small fluctuations in
the cavity field may have important consequence in the dynamics of condensate.
Beyond the steady-state approximaton, we show the cavity can play two different
roles to this dynamics. In the first case, it imprints a gauge potential to the
dynamics of condensate, giving rise to zero and $\pi$ Josephson dynamics.
Nevertheless, in the other case, it plays the role of non-reciprocial
transportation between the two hyperfine states, in which the stability of the
fixed points are tuned from elliptic to stable spiral for one of the trapped
phase and unstable spiral for the other trapped phase, thus the oscillating
dynamics will finally ceased. The transition between these dynamics can be
controlled by the parameters of the cavity field and the driving field. Our
results demonstrate an novel way to engineer the dynamics of condensate by
tuning the stability of the fixed points.

attention mechanism to refine the intra-sequence and inter-sequence feature
representation of videos, and outputs self-and-collaborative feature
representation for each video, making the discriminative frames aligned between
the probe and gallery sequences.Second, beyond existing models, a generalized
pairwise similarity measurement is proposed to calculate the similarity feature
representations of video pairs, enabling computing the matching scores by the
binary classifier. Third, a dense clip segmentation strategy is also introduced
to generate rich probe-gallery pairs to optimize the model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAN, which outperforms the
best-performing baselines on iLIDS-VID, PRID2011 and MARS dataset,

the conditional distributions of observations on the events, the Bayesian
detection can be applied to estimate events behind the observations. It has
been proved that Bayesian detection has the smallest overall testing error in
average sense. However, when detecting an event with very small prior
probability, the conditional Bayesian detection would result in high miss

reduce miss testing rate in conditions of detecting events with minor

computer vision algorithms fail to work. So it is necessary to remove the rain
from images. We propose a novel deep network architecture based on deep
convolutional and recurrent neural networks for single image deraining. As
contextual information is very important for rain removal, we first adopt the
dilated convolutional neural network to acquire large receptive field. To
better fit the rain removal task, we also modify the network. In heavy rain,
rain streaks have various directions and shapes, which can be regarded as the
accumulation of multiple rain streak layers. We assign different alpha-values
to various rain streak layers according to the intensity and transparency by
incorporating the squeeze-and-excitation block. Since rain streak layers
overlap with each other, it is not easy to remove the rain in one stage. So we
further decompose the rain removal into multiple stages. Recurrent neural
network is incorporated to preserve the useful information in previous stages
and benefit the rain removal in later stages. We conduct extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches under all evaluation metrics. Codes and

containing disc particles, has been experimentally and numerically reported to
locally enhance the gravity-driven hopper flow rate. Moreover, the peaked flow
rate can happen regardless of the interparticle friction, the inclusion
geometry, or the disc dispersity. To reveal the fundamental reason causing this
local effect, we propose a Tetris-like model that sequentially moves one disc

that independently controls a disc's movement in the horizontal or vertical

creates no overlap between objects in the system. Our model creates an
artificial steady probability-driven hopper flow without knowing the Newtonian
dynamics which allows interparticle collaborative motion. Under specific
conditions, we reproduce the enhanced flow rate and show that a moderate
response time of the system and a flow rate difference between its value around
the inclusion and its maximum without an inclusion are sufficient to explain
this local effect with no Newton's laws involved.

is governed by the angular cutoff Boltzmann equation with diffuse reflection
boundary, we study the effects of both soft intermolecular interaction and
non-isothermal wall temperature upon the long-time dynamics of solutions to the
corresponding initial boundary value problem. Specifically, we are devoted to
proving the existence and dynamical stability of stationary solutions whenever
the boundary temperature has suitably small variations around a positive
constant. For the proof of existence, we introduce a new mild formulation of
solutions to the steady boundary-value problem along the speeded backward
bicharacteristic, and develop the uniform estimates on approximate solutions in
both $L^2$ and $L^\infty$. Such mild formulation proves to be useful for
treating the steady problem with soft potentials even over unbounded domains.
In showing the dynamical stability, a new point is that we can obtain the
sub-exponential time-decay rate in $L^\infty$ without losing any velocity
weight, which is actually quite different from the classical results as in
[11,43] for the torus domain and essentially due to the diffuse reflection
boundary and the boundedness of the domain.

this paper, we propose a scheme to apply deep model obtained from labeled

on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained in
different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample
selection scheme for improving the transferability of deep models. More
precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks is first pre-trained with a
well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data. Then, given
a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to
classify the image in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are
assigned with pseudo-labels and employed as the queries to retrieve related
samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with the retrieved
results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained
deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target
image, we rely on the fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by
combining patch-wise classification and hierarchical segmentation. In addition,
we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing 150 Gaofen-2 satellite

encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to
land-cover classification.

popularity, not only as a digital form of currency but also as an investment
vehicle. Online marketplaces and exchanges allow users across the world to
convert between dozens of different cryptocurrencies and regular currencies
such as euros or dollars. Due to the novelty of this concept, the volatility of
these markets and the differences in maturity and usage of particular
marketplaces, currency pairs may appear at multiple marketplaces but at
different trading prices. This paper proposes a novel algorithmic approach to
take advantage of these mispricings and capitalize upon the pricing differences
that exist between exchanges and currency pairs. To do so, we model each
combination of a currency and a market as one node in a graph. A directed link
between two nodes indicates that a conversion between these two currency/market
pairs is possible. The weight of the link relates to the exchange rate of
executing this particular currency exchange. To leverage the mispricings, we
seek for cycles in the graph such that upon multiplying the weights of the
links in the cycle, a value greater than 1 is found and thus a profit can be
made. Our goal is to do this efficiently, without exhaustively enumerating all
possible cycles in the graph. Therefore, we convert our data and address the
problem in terms of finding minimum weight triangles in graphs with integer
weights, for which efficient algorithms can be utilized. We experiment with
parameter settings (heuristics) related to the conversion of exchange rate data
into integer weight values. We show that our approach improves upon a
reasonable baseline algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, using
a real-world dataset, we demonstrate how the obtained minimal weight cycles
indeed unveil a number of currency exchange cycles that result in a net profit.

position outputs and Bluetooth-based distances are affected by some degree of
noise. In our work, we propose several approaches to combine the two types of
outputs for improving the tracking accuracy in the context of collaborative
positioning. The two proposed approaches attempt to build a model for measuring
the errors of the Bluetooth output and Wi-Fi output. In a non-temporal
approach, the model establishes the relationship in a specific interval of the
Bluetooth output and Wi-Fi output. In a temporal approach, the error
measurement model is expanded to include the time component between users'
movement. To evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we collected the
data from several multiuser scenarios in indoor environment. The results show
that the proposed approaches could reach a distance error around 3.0m for 75
percent of time, which outperforms the positioning results of the standard
Wi-Fi fingerprinting model.

computing resources can provide computation task offloading opportunities for
other vehicles or pedestrians. However, vehicular network is highly dynamic,
with fast varying channel states and computation loads. These dynamics are
difficult to model or to predict, but they have major impact on the quality of
service (QoS) of task offloading, including delay performance and service
reliability. Meanwhile, the computing resources in VEC are often redundant due
to the high density of vehicles. To improve the QoS of VEC and exploit the
abundant computing resources on vehicles, we propose a learning-based task
replication algorithm (LTRA) based on combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB)
theory, in order to minimize the average offloading delay. LTRA enables
multiple vehicles to process the replicas of the same task simultaneously, and
vehicles that require computing services can learn the delay performance of
other vehicles while offloading tasks. We take the occurrence time of vehicles
into consideration, and redesign the utility function of existing CMAB
algorithm, so that LTRA can adapt to the time varying network topology of VEC.
We use a realistic highway scenario to evaluate the delay performance and
service reliability of LTRA through simulations, and show that compared with
single task offloading, LTRA can improve the task completion ratio with
deadline 0.6s from 80% to 98%.

passive blocks are used to store data during the intervals between its

in many real-world scenarios. Despite this, generating effective
recommendations with sparse user ratings remains a challenge. Side information
associated with items has been widely utilized to address rating sparsity.
Existing recommendation models that use side information are linear and, hence,
have restricted expressiveness. Deep learning has been used to capture
non-linearities by learning deep item representations from side information but
as side information is high-dimensional existing deep models tend to have large
input dimensionality, which dominates their overall size. This makes them
difficult to train, especially with small numbers of inputs.
  Rather than learning item representations, which is problematic with
high-dimensional side information, in this paper, we propose to learn feature
representation through deep learning from side information. Learning feature
representations, on the other hand, ensures a sufficient number of inputs to
train a deep network. To achieve this, we propose to simultaneously recover
user ratings and side information, by using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
Specifically, user ratings and side information are encoded and decoded
collectively through the same inference network and generation network. This is
possible as both user ratings and side information are data associated with
items. To account for the heterogeneity of user rating and side information,
the final layer of the generation network follows different distributions
depending on the type of information. The proposed model is easy to implement
and efficient to optimize and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art top-$N$
recommendation methods that use side information.

Privacy Paradox. Previous work has analysed this phenomenon through
after-the-fact comparisons, but not studied disclosure behaviour during
questioning. We physically surveyed UK cities to study how the British public
regard privacy and how perceptions differ between demographic groups. Through
analysis of optional data disclosure, we empirically examined whether those who
claim to value their privacy act privately with their own data. We found that
both opinions and self-reported actions have little effect on disclosure, with
over 99\% of individuals revealing private data needlessly. We show that not

$n$-$p$-$n$ homojunctions of uniaxially strained graphene. This atypical
converging electron flow emerges by applying uniaxial tension out of the
device's symmetry axes. A part of electron flow needs to be positively
refracted for focusing in an asymmetric spot, whose location is tunable with
the strain. In AVLs, Klein tunneling is angularly shifted regards to the normal
incidence. This perfect transmission occurs at the straight line that connects
the point source and focus, which is unaffected by variation of the Fermi level
and barrier's width. Moreover, the mirror symmetry breaking by the strain also
causes the asymmetry in Fabry-P\'erot interference. The novel electron optical
laws allow to evidence that reflected and refracted electrons in AVLs lie on
the same straight line with opposite group velocities and pseudo-spins. Unlike
isotropic graphene, electrons under normal incidence present backscattering,
angles of reflection and refraction different to zero. The average particle
transmission is higher (lower) than isotropic case when the tensile strain is
increased near (far away) the normal direction. These results may be useful for
designing strain-bendable probing tips in scanning tunneling microscopes.

systems is greatly determined by the capabilities of the signal processing
tools that are used. The received signal must not exceed a certain level of
complexity, beyond which the applied signal processing solutions become
insufficient or slow. Moreover, the required signal-to-noise ratio of the
received signal can be challenging, especially when adopting modulation formats
with multi-level encoding. Lately, photonic reservoir computing (RC) - a
hardware machine learning technique with recurrent connectivity - has been
proposed as a post-processing tool that deals with deterministic distortions
from fiber transmission. Here we show that RC post-processing is remarkably
efficient for multilevel encoding and for the use of very high launched optical
peak power for fiber transmission up to 14dBm. Higher power levels provide the
desired high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values at the receiver end, at the
expense of a complex nonlinear transformation of the transmission signal. Our
demonstration evaluates a direct fiber communication link with 4-level pulse
amplitude modulation (PAM-4) encoding and direct detection, without including
optical amplification, dispersion compensation, pulse shaping or other digital
signal processing (DSP) techniques. By applying RC post-processing on the
distorted signal, we numerically estimate fiber transmission distances of 27km
at 56Gb/s and of 5.5 km at 112Gb/s data encoding rates, while fulfilling the
hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) bit-error-rate (BER) limit for
data recovery. In an experimental equivalent demonstration of our photonic
reservoir, the achieved distances are 21km and 4.6km respectively.

(SMBH) is unknown. Although different options have been proposed, involving
e.g. intermediate mass direct collapse black holes, BH remnants of massive
stars remain the most natural explanation. To identify the most favorable
conditions (if any) for their rapid growth, we study the accretion rate of a
M_BH = 100M_sun BH formed in a typical z = 10 galaxy under different conditions
(e.g. galaxy structure, BH initial position and velocity). We model the galaxy
baryonic content and follow the BH orbit and accretion history for 300 Myr (the
time span in 10 > z > 7), assuming the radiation-regulated accretion model by
Park & Ricotti (2013). We find that, within the limits of our model, BH seeds
cannot grow by more than 30 percent, suggesting that accretion on light-seed
models are inadequate to explain high-z SMBH. We also compute the X-ray
emission from such accreting stellar BH population in the (0.5, 8) keV band and
find it comparable to the one produced by high-mass X-ray binaries. This study
suggests that early BHs, by X-ray pre-heating of the intergalactic medium at
cosmic dawn, might leave a specific signature on the HI 21 cm line power
spectrum potentially detectable with SKA.

reduces to a sort of mesoscopic version of the heat capacity. Adopting a more
practical perspective, we also discuss the relevance of qubit systems as
optimal quantum thermometers, in order to retrieve the temperature, or to
discriminate between two temperatures, characterizing a thermal reservoir. We
show that quantum coherence and entanglement in a probe system can facilitate
faster, or more accurate measurements of temperature. While not surprising
given this has been demonstrated in phase estimation, temperature is not a

models with realistic input parameters and computed synthetic MgII lines. The
method of Scargle periodograms was used to detect possible prominence
oscillations. We analyzed 2160 points of the observed prominence in five
different sections along the slit averaged over ten pixels due to low signal to
noise ratio in the CII and SiIV lines. We computed the integrated intensity for
all studied lines, while the central intensity and reversal ratio was
determined only for both MgII and CII 1334 lines. We plotted several
correlations: time evolution of the integrated intensities and central
intensities, scatter plots between all combinations of line integrated
intensities, and reversal ratio as a function of integrated intensity. We also
compared MgII observations with the models. Results show that more than
two-thirds of MgII profiles and about one-half of CII 1334 profiles are
reversed. Profiles of SiIV are generally unreversed. The MgII and CII lines are
optically thick, while the SiIV line is optically thin. The studied prominence
shows no global oscillations in the MgII and CII lines. Therefore, the observed
time variations are caused by random motions of fine structures with velocities
up to 10 km/s. The observed average ratio of MgII k to MgII h line intensities
can be used to determine the prominence's characteristic temperature. Certain
disagreements between observed and synthetic line intensities of MgII lines
point to the necessity of using more complex 2D multi-thread modeling in the

and intuitive interpretation. We incorporate the proposed criterion into the
one-parameter Bayesian continual reassessment method (CRM) and show, using
simulations, that it results in the same proportion of correct selections on
average as the original design, but in fewer mean number of toxic responses. A
comparison to other model-based dose-escalation designs demonstrates that the
proposed design can result in either the same mean accuracy as alternatives but
fewer number of toxic responses, or in a higher mean accuracy but the same
number of toxic responses. We conclude that the new criterion makes the
existing model-based designs more ethical without losing efficiency in the
context of Phase I clinical trials.

emission spectra from protoplanetary discs. This paper focuses on the mid-IR
spectral region between 9.7 um to 40 um for T Tauri stars. The generated
spectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,
OH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden
atomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and
ArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the
abundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,
but use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas
and dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes
the line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable
way. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational
data of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In
order to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high
gas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at
distances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated
easily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their
re-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be
optically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.
We find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc
surface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the effects of
C/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis
offers new ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri
discs from future JWST/MIRI observations, and to possibly detect secondary
illuminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular signature.

of these collisions by Feshbach resonances is hampered by huge inelastic
losses. Here, we suggest non-resonant light control of $p$-wave collisions,
exploiting the anisotropic coupling of non-resonant light to the polarizability
of the atoms. The $p$-wave scattering volume can be controlled by strong
non-resonant light, in close analogy to the $s$-wave scattering length. For
collision partners that are tightly trapped, the non-resonant light induces an
energy shift directly related to the generalized scattering volume. This effect
could be used to climb the ladder of the trap. We also show that controlling
the generalized scattering volume implies control, at least roughly, over the
orientation of the interparticle axis relative to the polarization direction of
the light at short interatomic distances. Our proposal is based on an
asymptotic model that explicitly accounts for the anisotropic dipole-dipole

functional shape of the interaction potential that allows to reproduce in an
approximative way the so-called roton minimum observed in experiments, without
leading to spurious local crystallization events. We then follow and track the
phenomenon of reconnection starting from a set of two perpendicular vortices. A
precise and quantitative study of various quantities characterizing the
evolution of this phenomenon is proposed: this includes the evolution of
statistics of several hydrodynamical quantities of interest, and the
geometrical description of a observed helical wave packet that propagates along
the vortex cores. Those geometrical properties are systematically compared to
the predictions of the Local Induction Approximation (LIA), showing
similarities and differences. The introduction of the roton minimum in the
model does not change the macroscopic properties of the reconnection event but
the microscopic structure of the vortices differs. Structures are generated at
the roton scale and helical waves are evidenced along the vortices. However,
contrary to what is expected in classical viscous or inviscid incompressible
flows, the numerical simulations do not evidence the generation of structures
at smaller or larger scales than the typical atomic size.

between multi-threaded indexing and score ties during retrieval may yield
non-deterministic rankings, making repeatability not as trivial as one might
imagine. In the context of the open-source Lucene search engine, score ties are
broken by internal document ids, which are assigned at index time. Due to
multi-threaded indexing, which makes experimentation with large modern document
collections practical, internal document ids are not assigned consistently
between different index instances of the same collection, and thus score ties
are broken unpredictably. This short paper examines the effectiveness impact of
such score ties, quantifying the variability that can be attributed to this
phenomenon. The obvious solution to this non-determinism and to ensure
repeatable document ranking is to break score ties using external collection
document ids. This approach, however, comes with measurable efficiency costs
due to the necessity of consulting external identifiers during query

influence the anomaly score depending on the complexity of the samples. By
removing these terms, we obtain an unregularized score, which we evaluated on a

characteristics, like flat radio spectra, compact radio cores, substantial
variability and high brightness temperatures. These objects are thought to be
similar to blazars as they possess relativistic jets seen at small angle to the
line of sight. This claim has been further supported by the Fermi satellite
discovery of gamma-ray emission from a handful of these sources. Using the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data, we analyzed the mid-infrared
variability characteristics of $42$ radio-loud NLS1 at $3.4$ and $4.6\,\mu$m.
We found that $27$ out of the studied $42$ sources showed variability in at
least one of the two infrared bands. In some cases, significant changes in the
infrared colors can alter the location of the source in the WISE color-color
diagram which might lead to different classification. More than $60$% of the
variable sources also showed variability within a $1-1.5$ day interval. Such
short time scales argue for a compact emission region like those associated
with the jets. This connection is further strengthened by the fact that the
brightest $\gamma$-ray emitters of the sample ($6$ sources), all showed short
time scale infrared variability.

study this problem in directed graphs with unit edge/vertex capacities

case, where the algorithm has to find all pairs with min-cut value less than
$k$, and report only those. The most basic case $k=1$ is the Transitive Closure
(TC) problem, which can be solved in graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges in
time $O(mn)$ combinatorially, and in time $O(n^{\omega})$ where $\omega<2.38$
is the matrix-multiplication exponent. These time bounds are conjectured to be
optimal.
  We present new algorithms and conditional lower bounds that advance the
frontier for larger $k$, as follows: (i) A randomized algorithm for vertex
capacities that runs in time $O((nk)^{\omega})$. (ii) Two deterministic
algorithms for edge capacities (which is more general) that work in DAGs and
further reports a minimum cut for each pair. The first algorithm is
combinatorial (does not involve matrix multiplication) and runs in time
$O(2^{O(k^2)}\cdot mn)$. The second algorithm can be faster on dense DAGs and
runs in time $O((k\log n)^{4^k+o(k)} n^{\omega})$. (iii) The first super-cubic
lower bound of $n^{\omega-1-o(1)} k^2$ time under the $4$-Clique conjecture,
which holds even in the simplest case of DAGs with unit vertex capacities. It
improves on the previous (SETH-based) lower bounds even in the unbounded
setting $k=n$. For combinatorial algorithms, our reduction implies an
$n^{2-o(1)} k^2$ conditional lower bound. Thus, we identify new settings where
the complexity of the problem is (conditionally) higher than that of TC.

this translates to difficulties in developing efficient protocols even for

new network adapter architecture that can address these challenges. The
BitSurfing adapter does not generate packets and, hence, abolishes the need for
the corresponding transmission circuitry and power consumption. Instead, it
relies on an external symbol generator. The BitSurfing adapter reads incoming
symbols, waiting for intended messages to appear in the symbol stream. A short

BitSurfing adapters are shown to exhibit perpetual (and even battery-less)
operation, ability to operate without medium access control, while being
completely transparent to applications. Moreover, their operation is
event-driven, allowing for clock-less implementations. The new adapters are
evaluated in a simulated multi-hop nano-IoT network and are shown to offer
nearly-perfect packet delivery rates and practically no collisions, under any
congestion level.

mixing predicts these alloys to be unstable towards unmixing at 0 K. The
calculations also predict, however, that these phases would be thermally
stabilised by configurational entropy at temperatures well below the values
used for synthesis. The temperature Ts below which they become unstable is
found to be quite sensitive to the presence of magnetic moments on Cr ions, as
well as to the material's magnetic order, in addition to chemical order and
composition. Allowing for magnetism, the value of Ts for helf V and half Cr
with chemically disordered Cr and V atoms, is estimated to be between 516 K and
645 K depending on the level of theory, while, if constrained to spin-paired,
Ts drops to 142 K. Antiferromagnetic spin arrangements are found to be favoured
at low temperatures, but they are most likely lost at synthesis temperatures,
and probably at room temperature as well. However, the combination of
antiferromagnetic frustration and configurational disorder should give rise to
interesting spin textures at low temperatures.

that human subjects are unable to distinguish the modified from the original.
Thus, listeners are able to identify the U segments irrespective of the gender,
which may be based on some speaker-independent invariant acoustic cues. To test
if this finding is purely a perceptual phenomenon, objective experiments are
also conducted. Gender specific HMM based phoneme recognition systems are
trained using the TIMIT training set and tested on (a) utterances spoken by the

type. These data can be inputted using an Excel spreadsheet. Organ dose

lookup tables of k-factors relating PKA to organ doses for a wide range of beam
angles, six patient sizes and two field sizes. These K-factors were calculated
using the Monte Carlo code PCXMC V2.0. CD16 initially calculates organ doses
for a beam energy represented by a HVL of 4.8 mm Al, then adjusts to other beam

assigns beam angles based on examination type. CD16 is the final version of

main-sequence stars with directly measured Mount Wilson S-indices and rotation
periods. The R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$ values are derived from the respective S-indices
and related to the rotation periods in various $B-V$-colour intervals. First,
we show that stars with vanishing magnetic activity, i.e. stars whose excess
flux index R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$ approaches zero, have a well-defined,
colour-dependent rotation period distribution; we also show that this rotation
period distribution applies to large samples of cool stars for which rotation
periods have recently become available. Second, we use empirical arguments to
equate this rotation period distribution with the global convective turnover
time, which is an approach that allows us to obtain clear relations between the
magnetic activity related excess flux index R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$, rotation
periods, and Rossby numbers. Third, we show that the activity versus Rossby
number relations are very similar in the different activity indicators. As a
consequence of our study, we emphasize that our Rossby number based on the
global convective turnover time approaches but does not exceed unity even for
entirely inactive stars. Furthermore, the rotation-activity relations might be

reinforcement learning (RL). ER recalls experiences from past iterations to
compute gradient estimates for the current policy, increasing data-efficiency.
However, the accuracy of such updates may deteriorate when the policy diverges
from past behaviors and can undermine the performance of ER. Many algorithms
mitigate this issue by tuning hyper-parameters to slow down policy changes. An
alternative is to actively enforce the similarity between policy and the
experiences in the replay memory. We introduce Remember and Forget Experience

of the dry available enthalpy function, also called flow exergy, were
investigated in a previous paper (Marquet, Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., Vol 117,
p.449-475, 1991). The concept of exergy is well defined in thermodynamics, and
several generalizations to chemically reacting systems have already been made.
Similarly, the concept of moist available enthalpy is presented in this paper
in order to generalize the dry available enthalpy to the case of a moist
atmosphere. It is a local exergy-like function which possesses a simple
analytical expression where only two unknown constants are to be determined, a
reference temperature and a reference pressure. The moist available enthalpy,
$a_m$, is defined in terms of a moist potential change in total entropy. The
local function $a_m$ can be separated into temperature, pressure and latent
components. The latent component is a new component that is not present in the
dry case. The moist terms have been estimated using a representative cumulus
vertical profile. It appears that the modifications brought by the moist
formulation are important in comparison with the dry case. Other local and
global properties are also investigated and comparisons are made with some
other available energy functions used in thermodynamics and meteorology.

such setting may be in lack of generalization, since the output space (or label
space) is apparently less informative.In this paper, we propose a novel method,
called Manifold Adversarial Training (MAT). MAT manages to build an adversarial
framework based on how the worst perturbation could affect the distributional
manifold rather than the output space. Particularly, a latent data space with
the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) will be first derived.On one hand, MAT tries
to perturb the input samples in the way that would rough the distributional
manifold the worst. On the other hand, the deep learning model is trained
trying to promote in the latent space the manifold smoothness, measured by the
variation of Gaussian mixtures (given the local perturbation around the data
point). Importantly, since the latent space is more informative than the output
space, the proposed MAT can learn better a robust and compact data
representation, leading to further performance improvement. The proposed MAT is
important in that it can be considered as a superset of one recently-proposed
discriminative feature learning approach called center loss. We conducted a
series of experiments in both supervised and semi-supervised learning on three
benchmark data sets, showing that the proposed MAT can achieve remarkable
performance, much better than those of the state-of-the-art adversarial
approaches. We also present a series of visualization which could generate
further understanding or explanation on adversarial examples.

of the parity degree of freedom in Majorana devices and serve as a first step
towards topological Majorana qubits. We discuss in detail the charge-stability

the overlap of the Majorana edge states. We describe the multi-level spectral

where conversion between Coulomb-blockade and transmon regimes generates
coherent oscillations of the qubit state due to the overlap of Majorana modes.

considerable measurement errors may be accumulated during the conversion
intervals when electrostatic fluctuations in the superconducting islands are

The
key insight in this vulnerability is that speculative execution in processors
can be misused to access the secrets. Subsequently, even though the
speculatively executed instructions are squashed, the secret may linger in
micro-architectural states such as cache, and can potentially be accessed by an
attacker via side channels. In this paper, we propose oo7, a static analysis
approach that can mitigate Spectre attacks by detecting potentially vulnerable
code snippets in program binaries and protecting them against the attack by
patching them. Our key contribution is to balance the concerns of
effectiveness, analysis time and run-time overheads. We employ control flow
extraction, taint analysis, and address analysis to detect tainted conditional
branches and speculative memory accesses. oo7 can detect all fifteen
purpose-built Spectre-vulnerable code patterns, whereas Microsoft compiler with
Spectre mitigation option can only detect two of them. We also report the
results of a large-scale study on applying oo7 to over 500 program binaries
(average binary size 261 KB) from different real-world projects. We protect
programs against Spectre attack by selectively inserting fences only at
vulnerable conditional branches to prevent speculative execution. Our approach

not commute, it often happens that the unique ground state of a finite system
exhibits long-range order (LRO) but does not show spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB). Typical examples include antiferromagnetic quantum spin systems with
Neel order, and lattice boson systems which exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation.
By extending and improving previous results by Horsch and von der Linden and by
Koma and Tasaki, we here develop a fully rigorous and almost complete theory
about the relation between LRO and SSB in the ground state of a finite system
with continuous symmetry. We show that a ground state with LRO but without SSB
is inevitably accompanied by a series of energy eigenstates, known as the
""tower"" of states, which have extremely low excitation energies. More
importantly, we also prove that one gets a physically realistic ""ground state""
by taking a superposition of these low energy excited states.
  The present paper is written in a self-contained manner, and does not require
any knowledge about the previous works on the subject.

  Regularization",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning models leak information about the datasets on which they are
trained. An adversary can build an algorithm to trace the individual members of
a model's training dataset. As a fundamental inference attack, he aims to
distinguish between data points that were part of the model's training set and
any other data points from the same distribution. This is known as the tracing
(and also membership inference) attack. In this paper, we focus on such attacks
against black-box models, where the adversary can only observe the output of
the model, but not its parameters. This is the current setting of machine
learning as a service in the Internet.
  We introduce a privacy mechanism to train machine learning models that
provably achieve membership privacy: the model's predictions on its training
data are indistinguishable from its predictions on other data points from the
same distribution. We design a strategic mechanism where the privacy mechanism
anticipates the membership inference attacks. The objective is to train a model
such that not only does it have the minimum prediction error (high utility),
but also it is the most robust model against its corresponding strongest
inference attack (high privacy). We formalize this as a min-max game
optimization problem, and design an adversarial training algorithm that
minimizes the classification loss of the model as well as the maximum gain of
the membership inference attack against it. This strategy, which guarantees
membership privacy (as prediction indistinguishability), acts also as a strong
regularizer and significantly generalizes the model.
  We evaluate our privacy mechanism on deep neural networks using different
benchmark datasets. We show that our min-max strategy can mitigate the risk of
membership inference attacks (close to the random guess) with a negligible cost
in terms of the classification error.

dislike) an item by leveraging the knowledge of the user's preferences as well
as that of other users. In practice, users interact and express their opinion
on only a small subset of items, which makes the corresponding user-item rating
matrix very sparse. Such data sparsity yields two main problems for recommender
systems: (1) the lack of data to effectively model users' preferences, and (2)
the lack of data to effectively model item characteristics. However, there are
often many other data sources that are available to a recommender system
provider, which can describe user interests and item characteristics (e.g.,
users' social network, tags associated to items, etc.). These valuable data
sources may supply useful information to enhance a recommendation system in
modeling users' preferences and item characteristics more accurately and thus,
hopefully, to make recommenders more precise. For various reasons, these data
sources may be managed by clusters of different data centers, thus requiring
the development of distributed solutions. In this paper, we propose a new
distributed collaborative filtering algorithm, which exploits and combines
multiple and diverse data sources to improve recommendation quality. Our
experimental evaluation using real datasets shows the effectiveness of our

has been tempered and slow moving, with recent estimates placing 45% of the
population without power three months after the storm. Consequently, we
developed a unique data-fusion mapping approach called the Urban Development

the recovery of electricity and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. Our approach
incorporates a combination of time series visualizations and change detection

a unique independent assessment of areas that are still struggling to recover.
For this workflow, our time series approach combines nighttime imagery from the

can identify and evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to

has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without power
over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across
the island indicate that 13.9% +/- ~5.6% of persons still lack power and/or
that 13.2% +/- ~5.3% of infrastructure has been lost. In comparison, the Puerto

problem, especially under the assumption that drivers act selfishly. A common
approach is the deterministic queuing model, for which the structure of dynamic
equilibria has been studied extensively in the last couple of years. The basic
idea is to model traffic by a continuous flow that travels over time through a
network, in which the arcs are endowed with transit times and capacities.
Whenever the flow rate exceeds the capacity the flow particles build up a
queue. So far it was not possible to represent spillback or kinematic waves in
this model. By introducing a storage capacity arcs can become full, and thus,
might block preceding arcs, i.e., spillback occurs. Furthermore, we model
kinematic waves by upstream moving flows over time representing the gaps
between vehicles. We carry over the main results of the original model to our
generalization, i.e., we characterize Nash flows over time by sequences of
particular static flows, so-called spillback thin flows. Furthermore, we give a
constructive proof for the existence of dynamic equilibria, which suggests an
algorithm for their computation. This solves an open problem stated by [13].

rings (in even degrees) of compact topological manifolds. In this analogy, a

to what extent do properties of the base and the fiber carry over to the

of an excess number of base-station antennas, relative to the number of active
terminals. This technology is a main component of 5G New Radio (NR) and
addresses all important requirements of future wireless standards: a great
capacity increase, the support of many simultaneous users, and improvement in
energy efficiency. Massive MIMO requires the simultaneous processing of signals
from many antenna chains, and computational operations on large matrices. The
complexity of the digital processing has been viewed as a fundamental obstacle
to the feasibility of Massive MIMO in the past. Recent advances on
system-algorithm-hardware co-design have led to extremely energy-efficient
implementations. These exploit opportunities in deeply-scaled silicon
technologies and perform partly distributed processing to cope with the
bottlenecks encountered in the interconnection of many signals. For example,
prototype ASIC implementations have demonstrated zero-forcing precoding in real
time at a 55 mW power consumption (20 MHz bandwidth, 128 antennas, multiplexing
of 8 terminals). Coarse and even error-prone digital processing in the antenna
paths permits a reduction of consumption with a factor of 2 to 5. This article
summarizes the fundamental technical contributions to efficient digital signal
processing for Massive MIMO. The opportunities and constraints on operating on
low-complexity RF and analog hardware chains are clarified. It illustrates how
terminals can benefit from improved energy efficiency. The status of technology
and real-life prototypes discussed. Open challenges and directions for future
research are suggested.

populations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-resolution VLT spectra we

stellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS is
formed of slow-rotating stars, while red-MS stars are fast rotators. Moreover,
we exploit photometry from Gaia DR2 to show that three Galactic open clusters,
namely NGC2099, NGC2360, and NGC2818, exhibit the eMSTO, thus suggesting that
it is a common feature among these objects. Our previous work on the Large
Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC1818 shows that slowly and fastly-rotating
stars populate the blue and red MS observed in its CMD. The similarities
between M11 and the young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds suggest that

massive runaway star BD +43$^{\circ}$3654 simple models have predicted
high-energy emission, at X and gamma-rays, from these Galactic sources.
Observational searches for this emission so far give no conclusive evidence but
a few candidates at gamma rays. In this work we aim at developing a more
sophisticated model for the non-thermal emission from massive runaway star bow
shocks. The main goal is to establish whether these systems are efficient
non-thermal emitters, even if they are not strong enough to be yet detected.
For modeling the collision between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium
we use 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We then adopt the flow profile of the wind
and the ambient medium obtained with the simulation as the plasma state for
solving the transport of energetic particles injected in the system, and the
non-thermal emission they produce. For this purpose we solve a 3D (2 spatial +
energy) advection-diffusion equation in the test-particle approximation. We
find that a massive runaway star with a powerful wind converts 0.16-0.4% of the
power injected in electrons into non-thermal emission, mostly produced by
inverse Compton scattering of dust-emitted photons by relativistic electrons,
and secondly by synchrotron radiation. This represents a fraction of $\sim$
$10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ of the wind kinetic power. Given the better sensibility of
current instruments at radio wavelengths theses systems are more prone to be
detected at radio through the synchrotron emission they produce rather than at
gamma energies.

better structured and CPU-efficient variant of this model. We re-analyzed the
self-consistent, homogeneous astrometric dataset in Konopacky (2016). The
best-fitting configuration agrees with our earlier findings. The planets are
likely involved in dynamically robust Laplace resonance chain. Hypothetical
planets with masses below the current detection limit of 0.1-3 Jupiter masses,
within the observed inner, or beyond the outer orbit, respectively, do not
influence the long term stability of the system. We predict positions of such

planets helps to simulate the dynamical structure of debris disks in the

their complex, resonant shape in 10^6 particles scale. We examine the inner

days only. A common mechanism to explain the short-period pile-up present in
the observations is the migration through Lidov-Kozai cycles combined with
tidal friction. Here, we revisit this mechanism and aim to determine the
initial orbital configurations leading to this process. We show that the mutual
inclination of the triple-star system is not the only critical parameter, since
the eccentricity as well as the argument of the pericenter of the inner orbit
also play an important role in the establishment of the Lidov-Kozai migration.
Our framework is the secular hierarchical three-body problem (octupole order
approximation) with general relativity corrections, including the effects of
tides, stellar oblateness and magnetic spin-down braking. Both the orbital and
the spin evolutions are considered. Extensive numerical simulations with
uniform and non-uniform distributions of the initial orbital parameters are
carried out, and unbiased initial conditions leading to Lidov-Kozai migration
are revealed. Finally, we highlight the importance of the initial ""Kozai

Galactic disk. Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE)
or dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are
extreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound from the Galaxy. Powerful
acceleration mechanisms such as the tidal disruption of a binary system by a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) are required to produce them. Therefore, HVSs
are believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC), the only place known to
host an SMBH. The second Gaia data release (DR2) offers the opportunity of
studying HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit some of the most
interesting high-velocity stars, that is, 15 stars for which proper motions
with the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel
their origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses based on revised
spectrophotometric distances and proper motions from Gaia DR2, kinematic
properties were obtained that help constrain the spatial origins of these
stars. Stars that were previously considered (un)bound remain (un)bound in
Galactic potentials favored by Gaia DR2 astrometry. For nine stars (five
candidate HVSs plus all four radial velocity outliers), the GC can be ruled out
as spatial origin at least at $2\sigma$ confidence level, suggesting that a
large portion of the known HVSs are disk runaway stars launched close to or
beyond Galactic escape velocities. The fastest star in the sample, HVS3, is
confirmed to originate in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because the ejection
velocities of five of our non-GC stars are close to or above the upper limits
predicted for BSE and DE, another powerful dynamical ejection mechanism (e.g.,
involving massive perturbers such as intermediate-mass black holes) is likely
to operate in addition to the three classical scenarios mentioned above.

particle Monte Carlo approach of phonon transport is particularly powerful and
convenient, and requires reasonable computational resources. In this work, we
propose an original and versatile particle Monte Carlo approach parametrized by
using ab-initio data. Both the phonon dispersion and the phonon-phonon
scattering rates have been computed by DFT calculation in the entire 3D
Brillouin zone. To treat the phonon transport at rough interfaces, a
combination of specular and diffuse reflections has been implemented in phase
space. Thermal transport has been investigated in nanowires and thin films made
of cubic and hexagonal Silicon, including edge roughness, in terms of effective
thermal conductivity, phonon band contributions and heat flux orientation. It
is shown that the effective thermal conductivity in quasi-ballistic regime
obtained from our Monte Carlo simulation cannot be accurately fitted by simple
semi-analytical Matthiessen-like models and that spectral approaches are
mandatory to get good results. Our Full Band approach shows that some phonon
branches exhibiting a negative group velocity in some parts of the Brillouin
zone may contribute negatively to the total thermal flux. Besides, the thermal
flux clearly appears to be oriented along directions of high density of states.
The resulting anisotropy of the heat flux is discussed together with the
influence of rough interfaces.

with algebra. We draw an uninterrupted line of thought between algebra and
computational effects. We begin on the mathematical side of things, by
reviewing the classic notions of universal algebra: signatures, algebraic

applies to computational effects. In the last step we replace traditional

robotics and control systems. The control systems community has started to show
interest towards several machine learning algorithms from the sub-domains such
as supervised learning, imitation learning and reinforcement learning to
achieve autonomous control and intelligent decision making. Amongst many
complex control problems, stable bipedal walking has been the most challenging
problem. In this paper, we present an architecture to design and simulate a
planar bipedal walking robot(BWR) using a realistic robotics simulator, Gazebo.
The robot demonstrates successful walking behaviour by learning through several
of its trial and errors, without any prior knowledge of itself or the world
dynamics. The autonomous walking of the BWR is achieved using reinforcement
learning algorithm called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG). DDPG is one
of the algorithms for learning controls in continuous action spaces. After
training the model in simulation, it was observed that, with a proper shaped
reward function, the robot achieved faster walking or even rendered a running
gait with an average speed of 0.83 m/s. The gait pattern of the bipedal walker
was compared with the actual human walking pattern. The results show that the
bipedal walking pattern had similar characteristics to that of a human walking
pattern. The video presenting our experiment is available at

wind shaping processes in which a fast wind from the central star impacts a

flow. We present new results demonstrating the effectiveness of Common Envelope
Evolution (CEE) at producing aspherical envelopes which, when impinged upon by
a spherical fast stellar wind, produce highly bipolar, jet-like outflows. We
have run two simple cases using the output of a single PHANTOM SPH CEE
simulation. Our work uses the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code AstroBEAR to track
the interaction of the fast wind and CEE ejecta allowing us to follow the
morphological evolution of the outflow lobes at high resolution in 3-D. Our two
models bracket low and high momentum output fast winds. We find the interaction
leads to highly collimated bipolar outflows. In addition, the bipolar
morphology depends on the fast wind momentum injection rate. With this
dependence comes the initiation of significant symmetry breaking between the
top and bottom bipolar lobes. Our simulations, though simplified, confirm the
long-standing belief that CEE can plan a major role in PPN and PN shaping.

analysis. We introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network (SSPN), a novel deep

of competing risks. SSPN circumvents the nonidentifiability problem by avoiding
the estimation of cause-specific survival curves and instead determines
pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, where longer event times are assigned
lower risks. Furthermore, SSPN is able to directly optimize an approximation to
the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics which are
unable to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing

processing steps to produce realistic images. The first two steps are usually
related to denoising and demosaicking where the former aims to reduce noise
from the sensor and the latter converts a series of light intensity readings to
color images. Modern approaches try to jointly solve these problems, i.e. joint
denoising-demosaicking which is an inherently ill-posed problem given that
two-thirds of the intensity information is missing and the rest are perturbed
by noise. While there are several machine learning systems that have been
recently introduced to solve this problem, the majority of them relies on
generic network architectures which do not explicitly take into account the
physical image model. In this work we propose a novel algorithm which is
inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods, large-scale
optimization, and deep learning techniques. Consequently, our derived iterative
optimization algorithm, which involves a trainable denoising network, has a
transparent and clear interpretation compared to other black-box data driven
approaches. Our extensive experimentation line demonstrates that our proposed
method outperforms any previous approaches for both noisy and noise-free data
across many different datasets. This improvement in reconstruction quality is
attributed to the rigorous derivation of an iterative solution and the
principled way we design our denoising network architecture, which as a result
requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art solution
and furthermore can be efficiently trained by using a significantly smaller
number of training data than existing deep demosaicking networks. Code and

fast growing research areas including information retrieval, biology, and
natural language processing. The traditional approach for string similarity
measurements is to define a metric over a word space that quantifies and sums
up the differences between characters in two strings. The state-of-the-art in
the area has, surprisingly, not evolved much during the last few decades. The
majority of the metrics are based on a simple comparison between character and
character distributions without consideration for the context of the words.
This paper proposes a string metric that encompasses similarities between
strings based on (1) the character similarities between the words including.
Non-Standard and standard spellings of the same words, and (2) the context of
the words. Our proposal is a neural network composed of a denoising autoencoder
and what we call a context encoder specifically designed to find similarities
between the words based on their context. The experimental results show that
the resulting metrics succeeds in 85.4\% of the cases in finding the correct
version of a non-standard spelling among the closest words, compared to 63.2\%
with the established Normalised-Levenshtein distance. Besides, we show that
words used in similar context are with our approach calculated to be similar
than words with different contexts, which is a desirable property missing in
established string metrics.

L^1(\Omega_T),\\ u(0,x)=u_0(x)\in L^1(\Omega). \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*} The growth of the monotone vector field $A$ is assumed to be
controlled by a generalized nonhomogeneous and anisotropic $N$-function
$M:[0,T)\times \Omega \times\mathbb{R}^n \to[0,\infty)$. Existence and
uniqueness of renormalized solutions are proven in absence of~Lavrentiev's
phenomenon. The condition we impose to ensure approximation properties of the
space is a certain type of balance of interplay between the behaviour of $M$
for large $|\xi|$ and small changes of time and space variables. Its instances
are log-H\""older continuity of variable exponent (inhomogeneous in time and
space) or optimal closeness condition for powers in double phase spaces
(changing in time). The noticeable challenge of this paper is considering the
problem in non-reflexive and inhomogeneous fully anisotropic space that changes
along time. New delicate approximation-in-time result is proven and applied in
the construction of renormalized solutions.

unusual equation of state $\rho c^2<0$, $P>0$ where $\rho$ is the mass density

themselves the forces of gravitational repulsion. The equilibrium of such stars
is ensured by a non-standard balance of forces. Negative mass density, acting
gravitationally on itself, creates an acceleration of the negative mass,
directed from the center. Therefore in the absence of pressure such an object
tends to expand. At the same time, the positive pressure, which falls just like
in ordinary stars from the center to the surface, creates a force directed from
the center. This force acts on the negative mass density, which causes
acceleration directed the opposite of the acting force, that is to the center
of the star. This acceleration balances the gravitational repulsion produced by
the negative mass. Thus, in our models gravity and pressure change roles: the
negative mass tends to create a gravitational repulsion, while the gradient of
the pressure acting on the negative mass tends to compress the star. In this
paper, we construct several models of such a star with various equations of
state.

construction of phase diagrams and the identification of ground state atomic
orderings. The recent development of compressive sensing approaches for the
construction of lattice models has further enabled the systematic construction
of sparse physical models without the need for human intuition other than
requiring the compactness of effective cluster interactions. However,
conventional compressive sensing based on L1-norm regularization is strictly
only applicable to certain classes of optimization problems and is otherwise
not guaranteed to generate optimally sparse and transferable results, so that
the method can only be applied to some materials science applications. In this
paper, we illustrate a more robust L0L1-norm compressive-sensing method that
removes the limitations of conventional compressive sensing and generally
results in sparser lattice models that are at least as predictive as those
obtained from L1-norm compressive sensing. Apart from the theory, a practical
implementation based on state-of-the-art mixed-integer quadratic programming
(MIQP) is proposed. The robustness of our methodology is illustrated for four
different transition-metal oxides with relevance as battery cathode materials:
Li2xTi2(1-x)O2, Li2xNi2yO2, MgxCr2O4, and NaxCrO2. This method provides a
practical and robust approach for the construction of sparser and more

electrode and cell potential is explained in terms of the generation of spin
2-boson gravitons from the fusion of spin-1 boson virtual-photons followed by
their eventual escape in higher dimensions. Gravitational transformations of
cell potential and electrochemical rate constants are also derived that explain
gravitational time dilation in electrode processes. These gravitational
transformations show a decrease in the cell potential and electrochemical rate
constants at the lower gravitational field. The dropping of cell potential at
the lower gravitational field is also explained in terms of the greater flux of

higher gravitational fields. Daniel's cell is mentioned as a numerical example

the frequency of the energy extraction events, which is either N times greater
than the vibration frequency (Multiple SECE case, N > 1) or 1/N times smaller

decreasing N both lead to a damping reduction. While N has no impact on the

this resonant frequency becomes a function of N in the Multiple SECE case (N >
