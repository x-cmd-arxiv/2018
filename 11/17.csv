feature space machine learning framework that allows a machine learning model
to learn from highly informative or privileged features which are available
during training only to generate test predictions using input space features
which are available both during training and testing. LUPI can significantly
improve prediction performance in a variety of machine learning problems.
However, existing large margin and neural network implementations of learning
using privileged information are mostly designed for classification tasks. In
this work, we have proposed a simple yet effective formulation that allows us
to perform regression using privileged information through a custom loss
function. Apart from regression, our formulation allows general application of
LUPI to classification and other related problems as well. We have verified the
correctness, applicability and effectiveness of our method on regression and
classification problems over different synthetic and real-world problems. To
test the usefulness of the proposed model in real-world problems, we have
evaluated our method on the problem of protein binding affinity prediction. The
proposed LUPI regression-based model has shown to outperform the current
state-of-the-art predictor.

Galactic center distance ($R_0$) estimate obtained by solving the general
problem of determining the geometric parameters of a Galactic spiral arm from
its segment with the inclusion of the distance to the spiral pole, i.e., $R_0$,
in the set of parameters has been studied by the Monte Carlo method. Our
numerical simulations have been performed for the model segments representing
the Perseus and Scutum arms based on masers in high-mass star forming regions.
We show that the uncertainty in the present-day parallax measurements for these
objects systematically decreases (!) with increasing heliocentric distance,
while the relative uncertainty in the parallaxes is approximately constant.
This lucky circumstance increases by a factor of 1.4-1.7 the accuracy of
estimating $R_0$ from the arm segment traced by masers. Our numerical
experiments provide evidence for the consistency of the $R_0$ estimate from the
spiral-segment geometry. The significant biases of the estimate detected only
for the Scutum arm are caused mainly by the random parallax errors, the small
angular extent of the segment, and the small number of objects representing it.
The dispersion of the $R_0$ estimate depends most strongly on the angular
extent of the segment and the parallax uncertainty if the latter, on average,
does not depend on the distance. When the data on 3-8 segments are processed
simultaneously, the predicted standard error of the final estimate is
$\sigma_{R_0} \simeq 0.5$-$0.3$ kpc, respectively. The accuracy can be improved
by increasing the extent of the identified segments and the number of objects
belonging to them. A more complex variant of the method taking into account the
measuring and natural dispersions of objects relative to the arm center line
will avoid the biases of the parameter estimates.

figure out how to navigate to the exit by accomplishing a number of
intermediate tasks (\emph{subgoals}), such as finding keys or opening doors.
Our environments are procedurally generated and vary in complexity, which can
be controlled by the number of subgoals and relationships between them. Next,
we propose to measure the complexity of each environment by constructing
dependency graphs between the goals and analytically computing \emph{hitting

Optimization (PPO) with sparse and shaped rewards, a variation of policy
sketches, and a hierarchical version of PPO (called HiPPO) akin to h-DQN. We
show that analytically estimated \emph{hitting time} in goal dependency graphs
is an informative metric of the environment complexity. We conjecture that the
result should hold for environments other than navigation. Finally, we show
that solving environments beyond certain level of complexity requires

result is that when $X$ is a real rational algebraic surface, Welschinger

homological data associated to $X$. This strengthened the invariance statement
initially proved by Welschinger.
  This main result follows easily from a formula relating Welschinger

its proof is a mild adaptation of the proof of analogous formulas previously

ventricles, especially the left ventricle, have an established standard
representation (e.g. bull's eye plot), the 2D depiction of the left atrium (LA)
is challenging due to its sub-structural complexity including the pulmonary
veins (PV) and the left atrial appendage (LAA). Quasi-conformal flattening
techniques, successfully applied to cardiac ventricles, require additional
constraints in the case of the LA to place the PV and LAA in the same
geometrical 2D location for different cases. Some registration-based methods
have been proposed but 3D (or 2D) surface registration is time-consuming and
prone to errors if the geometries are very different. We propose a novel atrial

quickly and without errors related to registration. In our approach, the LA is
divided into 5 regions which are then mapped to their analogue two-dimensional

strict preference lists. A matching $M$ is popular in $G$ if $M$ does not lose
a head-to-head election against any matching where vertices are voters. Every
stable matching is a min-size popular matching; another subclass of popular
matchings that always exist and can be easily computed is the set of dominant
matchings. A popular matching $M$ is dominant if $M$ wins the head-to-head
election against any larger matching. Thus every dominant matching is a
max-size popular matching and it is known that the set of dominant matchings is
the linear image of the set of stable matchings in an auxiliary graph. Results
from the literature seem to suggest that stable and dominant matchings behave,
from a complexity theory point of view, in a very similar manner within the
class of popular matchings.
  The goal of this paper is to show that indeed there are differences in the
tractability of stable and dominant matchings, and to investigate further their
importance for popular matchings. First, we show that it is easy to check if
all popular matchings are also stable, however it is co-NP hard to check if all
popular matchings are also dominant. Second, we show how some new and recent
hardness results on popular matching problems can be deduced from the
NP-hardness of certain problems on stable matchings, also studied in this
paper, thus showing that stable matchings can be employed not only to show
positive results on popular matching (as is known), but also most negative
ones. Problems for which we show new hardness results include finding a
min-size (resp. max-size) popular matching that is not stable (resp. dominant).
A known result for which we give a new and simple proof is the NP-hardness of
finding a popular matching when $G$ is non-bipartite.

is to pass from a canonical, operatorial representation, where the low-energy
states have a direct physical interpretation in terms of a Bogoliubov vacuum
and its corresponding quasiparticle excitations, to a functional, path integral
representation, via the formalism of the transfer matrix. In this way we obtain
a lattice effective theory for mesons in a self-consistent setting. We also
verify that well-known results from other different approaches are reproduced

polarons are predicted to form around charged dopants in an antiferromagnetic
background in the low doping regime close to the Mott insulating state.
Macroscopic transport and spectroscopy measurements related to high $T_{c}$
materials have yielded strong evidence for the existence of such quasiparticles
in these systems. Here we report the first microscopic observation of magnetic
polarons in a doped Fermi-Hubbard system, harnessing the full single-site spin
and density resolution of our ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We reveal the
dressing of mobile doublons by a local reduction and even sign reversal of
magnetic correlations, originating from the competition between kinetic and
magnetic energy in the system. The experimentally observed polaron signatures
are found to be consistent with an effective string model at finite
temperature. We demonstrate that delocalization of the doublon is a necessary
condition for polaron formation by contrasting this mobile setting to a
scenario where the doublon is pinned to a lattice site. Our work paves the way
towards probing interactions between polarons, which may lead to stripe
formation, as well as microscopically exploring the fate of polarons in the
pseudogap and bad metal phase.

controversial. The broadband continuum spectrum and fast variability properties
can be explained in a model where the inner disc evaporates into a
geometrically thick, hot flow. However these models are challenged by the
persistent detection of an extremely broad iron line, which requires that the
disc extends down to the last stable orbit of a high spin black hole. This line
width can be considerably reduced if the Comptonisation continuum is
multi-component rather than single temperature, but such models are highly
degenerate. Here we show a specific model of a radially stratified continuum
coupled to a model of propagating fluctuations, fit to some of the best hard
state data from GX 339-4. This full spectral-timing model can fit the time
averaged spectrum, the power spectra in different energy bands, and the
frequency dependent lags between these bands. For the first time we also
include disc reverberation and show that this same spectral-timing model
successfully \textit{predicts} the lag-energy spectra on all timescales. This
gives a more robust method to determine the inner radius of the disc, which is
of order $20~R_g$, i.e. significantly truncated. This opens up the way to use
the fast variability spectral-timing data to trace the source geometry of black

that every rational number in $[1,2]$ is realisable. Despite decades of effort,
the only known realisable numbers are $0,1, \frac{7}{5}, 2$, and the numbers of
the form $1+\frac{1}{m}$, $2-\frac{1}{m}$, $2-\frac{2}{m}$ for integers $m \geq

includes all previously known ones, and gives infinitely many limit points

from being interesting on its own, we show that, somewhat surprisingly, this
subdivision conjecture in fact implies that every rational number between 1 and

these systems is surprising given all brown dwarf and massive planets with

tentatively inconsistent with dynamically chaotic migration for systems with
massive companions, though the stronger tidal influence of these companions
makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the primordial obliquity distribution

parametrization, which contains the pivoting redshift $z_p$ as an extra free
parameter. We use various data combinations from cosmic microwave background
(CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), redshift space distortion (RSD),
weak lensing (WL), joint light curve analysis (JLA), cosmic chronometers (CC),
and we include a Gaussian prior on the Hubble constant value, in order to
extract the observational constraints on various quantities. For the case of
free $z_p$ we find that for all data combinations it always remains
unconstrained, and there is a degeneracy with the current value of the dark
energy equation of state $w_0$. For the case where $z_p$ is fixed to specific
values, and for the full data combination, we find that with increasing $z_p$
the mean value of $w_0$ slowly moves into the phantom regime, however the
cosmological constant is always allowed within 1$\sigma$ confidence-level.
However, the significant effect is that with increasing $z_p$ the correlations
between $w_0$ and $w_a$ change from negative to positive, with the case $z_p
=0.35$ corresponding to no correlation. This feature indeed justifies why a
non-zero pivoting redshift should be taken into account.

examine the main components of the FM-index in more detail, which is a rank
data structure over the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) of the string that will
allow us to find the interval in the string's suffix array (SA) containing

sample of the SA that --- when used with the rank data structure --- allows us
access the SA. The rank data structure can be kept small even for large genomic
databases, by run-length compressing the BWT, but until recently there was no
means known to keep the SA sample small without greatly slowing down access to
the SA. Now that Gagie et al. (SODA 2018) have defined an SA sample that takes
about the same space as the run-length compressed BWT --- we have the design
for efficient FM-indexes of genomic databases but are faced with the problem of
building them. In 2018 we showed how to build the BWT of large genomic

video sequences. Recurrent neural networks, particularly long short-term memory
(LSTM) units, have been popular as an efficient tool for encoding
spatio-temporal features in sequences. In this work, we investigate the effect
of mode variations on the encoded spatio-temporal features using LSTMs. We show
that the LSTM retains information related to the mode variation in the
sequence, which is irrelevant to the task at hand (e.g. classification facial
expressions). Actually, the LSTM forget mechanism is not robust enough to mode
variations and preserves information that could negatively affect the encoded
spatio-temporal features. We propose the mode variational LSTM to encode
spatio-temporal features robust to unseen modes of variation. The mode
variational LSTM modifies the original LSTM structure by adding an additional
cell state that focuses on encoding the mode variation in the input sequence.
To efficiently regulate what features should be stored in the additional cell
state, additional gating functionality is also introduced. The effectiveness of
the proposed mode variational LSTM is verified using the facial expression
recognition task. Comparative experiments on publicly available datasets
verified that the proposed mode variational LSTM outperforms existing methods.
Moreover, a new dynamic facial expression dataset with different modes of
variation, including various modes like pose and illumination variations, was
collected to comprehensively evaluate the proposed mode variational LSTM.
Experimental results verified that the proposed mode variational LSTM encodes
spatio-temporal features robust to unseen modes of variation.

tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing need for both a
higher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematic effects
(e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between Mks and
mass spanning $0.075M_\odot<M<0.70M_\odot$. The relation is derived from 62
nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2
imaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their
orbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a
precision better than 1% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in
combination with resolved Ks magnitudes and system parallaxes, to calibrate the
mass-Mks relation. The result can be used to determine masses of single stars
with a precision of 2-3%, which we confirm by a comparison to dynamical masses
from the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit
relation beyond mass uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in
the mass-Mks relation or underestimated measurement errors. We find the effect
of [Fe/H] on the mass-Mks relation is likely negligible for metallicities in
the Solar neighborhood (0.0+/-2.2% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]).
This weak effect is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar
Evolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and
Stellar Tracks. A sample of binaries with a wider range of abundances will be
required to discern the importance of metallicity in extreme populations (e.g.,
in the Galactic Halo or thick disk).

construct a new class of time-dependent isotropic solutions to the decaying
turbulence problems (whose solutions are energy conserved), with general
initial conditions. These solutions exhibit the interesting property that the
energy is cascaded from small wavenumbers to large wavenumbers. We can prove
that starting with a regular initial condition whose energy at the infinity
wave number $|p|=\infty$ is $0$, as time evolves, the energy is gradually
accumulated at $\{|p|=\infty\}$. Finally, all the energy of the system is
concentrated at $\{|p|=\infty\}$ and the energy function becomes a Dirac
function at infinity $E\delta_{\{|p|=\infty\}}$, where $E$ is the total energy.
The existence of this class of solutions is, in some sense, {the first complete
rigorous} mathematical proof based on the kinetic description for the energy
cascade phenomenon for waves with quadratic nonlinearities. We only represent
in this paper the analysis of the statistical description of acoustic waves

explore the dynamical processes leading to binary system formation in GCs. In
this work, 9 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data were used to investigate
the gamma-ray emission from all GCs in the Milky Way. 23 clusters were found as
gamma-ray bright, with 2 of them never having been reported before. It was also
found that magnetic braking probably has a smaller impact on the formation rate
of binary systems in metal-rich GCs than previously suggested, while a large
value for the two-body encounter rate seems to be a necessary condition. The
influence of the encounter rate per formed binary was for the first time
explored in conjunction with gamma-ray data, giving evidence that if this
quantity is very high, binary systems will get destroyed before having time to
evolve into MSPs, thus decreasing the total number of MSPs in a GC. No extended
emission was found even for clusters whose optical extent is ~0.5 degrees; all
of them are point-like sources spatially in agreement with the optical cores of
the GCs, supporting previous X-rays results of heavier objects sinking into the
clusters' cores via dynamical friction. The possibility of extrapolating these
results to ultra-compact dwarf galaxies is discussed, as these systems are
believed to be the intermediate case between GCs and dwarf galaxies.

parallel cells without a depth gradient. A modified linear stability analysis
is employed to derive an expression for the growth rate of perturbations on the

Hele-Shaw cells with small gap gradients. Based on this new expression for
$Ca_c$, a three-regime theory is formulated to describe the interface
(in)stability: (i) in Regime I, the growth rate is always negative, thus the
interface is stable; (ii) in Regime II, the growth rate remains zero (parallel
cells), changes from negative to positive (converging cells), or from positive
to negative (diverging cells), thus the interface (in)stability possibly
changes type at some location in the cell; (iii) in Regime III, the growth rate
is always positive, thus the interface is unstable. We conduct
three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of the full Navier--Stokes
equations, using a phase field method to enforce surface tension at the
interface, to verify the theory and explore the effect of depth gradient on the
interface (in)stability. We demonstrate that the depth gradient has only a
slight influence in Regime I, and its effect is most pronounced in Regime III.

#P-hardness holds even for workflows with a very simple structure in which all
transitions times are 1 or 0, and all probabilities are 1 or 0.5.

also be used to automatically collect training data for our method, by
recording images of scenes, grasping and removing an object, and recording the
outcome. Our experiments demonstrate that this self-supervised approach for

transfer to other tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent
model parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that
allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By
pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe
provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic
sizes efficiently. Moreover, GPipe utilizes a novel batch-splitting pipelining
algorithm, resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned

fundamentally tied to its knowledge about the surrounding world. We present an
approach to grounding natural language utterances in the context of factual
information gathered through natural-language interactions and past visual
observations. A probabilistic model estimates, from a natural language
utterance, the objects,relations, and actions that the utterance refers to, the
objectives for future robotic actions it implies, and generates a plan to
execute those actions while updating a state representation to include newly
acquired knowledge from the visual-linguistic context. Grounding a command
necessitates a representation for past observations and interactions; however,
maintaining the full context consisting of all possible observed objects,
attributes, spatial relations, actions, etc., over time is intractable.
Instead, our model, Temporal Grounding Graphs, maintains a learned state
representation for a belief over factual groundings, those derived from
natural-language interactions, and lazily infers new groundings from visual
observations using the context implied by the utterance. This work
significantly expands the range of language that a robot can understand by
incorporating factual knowledge and observations of its workspace in its
inference about the meaning and grounding of natural-language utterances.

simulations of a super-Eddington black hole (BH) accretion disk formed as a
result of a tidal disruption event (TDE). We consider the fiducial case of a
solar mass star on a mildly penetrating orbit disrupted by a supermassive BH of
mass $10^6 \, M_\odot$, and consider the epoch of peak fall back rate. We
post-process the simulation data to compute viewing angle dependent spectra. We
perform a parameter study of the dynamics of the accretion disk as a function
of BH spin and magnetic flux, and compute model spectra as a function of the
viewing angle of the observer. We also consider detection limits based on the
model spectra. We find that an accretion disk with a relatively weak magnetic
field around the BH (so-called SANE regime of accretion) does not launch a
relativistic jet, whether or not the BH is rotating. Such models reasonably
reproduce several observational properties of non-jetted TDEs. The same is also
true for a non-rotating BH with a strong magnetic field (MAD regime). One of
our simulations has a rapidly rotating BH (spin parameter 0.9) as well as a MAD
accretion disk. This model launches a powerful relativistic jet, which is
powered by the BH spin energy. It reproduces the high energy emission and jet
structure of the jetted TDE Swift J1644+57 surprisingly well. Jetted TDEs may
thus correspond to the subset of TDE systems that have both a rapidly spinning
BH and MAD accretion.

mechanics, etc.) and industrial applications (hydraulic fracturing, CO$_2$
storage, etc.). However, such flows are notoriously difficult to model due to
the variety of fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions that can
occur. In this work, we focus on non-Brownian shear-dominated suspensions,
where kinetic collisions are negligible and frictional effects play a dominant
role. Under these circumstances, irreversible phenomena such as particle
diffusion and migration arise, requiring anisotropic stress models to describe
the suspension rheology. On a continuum level, reduced-order models such as the
suspension balance model (SBM) or the diffusive flux model are commonly used to
predict particle migration phenomena. We propose a new method based on a
two-fluid model (TFM), where both the phases are considered as interpenetrating
continua with their own conservation of mass and momentum equations. Without
employing the nowadays customary simplifications in applying the SBM, we close
the ``full'' TFM instead. Specifically, we show that when an anisotropic stress
analogous to that used in the SBM is added to the equilibrium equations for the
particle phase, the TFM is able to accurately predict particle migration. Thus,
the TFM does not require the assumptions of a steady suspension velocity and a
Stokesian (inertialess) fluid, and the TFM can be easily extended to include
buoyancy and even kinetic collisional models. We present several benchmark
simulations of our TFM implementation in
OpenFOAM{\textsuperscript\textregistered}, including in curvilinear coordinates
and three-dimensional flow. Good agreement between the TFM solutions and
previous experimental and numerical results is found.

  We evaluate our approach on standard video compression test sets of varying

HEVC/H.265, AVC/H.264 and VP9 typically produce codes up to 60% larger. On
high-definition 1080p videos, H.265 and VP9 typically produce codes up to 20%

from blocking artifacts and pixelation, and thus produces videos that are more

  We propose two main contributions. The first is a novel architecture for
video compression, which (1) generalizes motion estimation to perform any
learned compensation beyond simple translations, (2) rather than strictly
relying on previously transmitted reference frames, maintains a state of
arbitrary information learned by the model, and (3) enables jointly compressing
all transmitted signals (such as optical flow and residual).
  Secondly, we present a framework for ML-based spatial rate control: namely, a
mechanism for assigning variable bitrates across space for each frame. This is
a critical component for video coding, which to our knowledge had not been

cross-correlation between the interlopers and survey galaxies, because the true
cross-correlation must be negligibly small. The estimated interloper fractions,
in turn, remove the interloper bias in the cosmological parameter estimation.
For example, in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX)
low-redshift ($z<0.5$) [O II] $\lambda3727${\AA} emitters contaminate

in astrophysics. Exploring the differences in the inner accretion disk
properties between RL and radio quiet (RQ) quasars might yield helpful clues to
this puzzle. We previously discovered that the shorter term UV/optical
variations of quasars are bluer than the longer term ones, i.e., the so-called
timescale-dependent color variation. This is consistent with the scheme that
the faster variations come from the inner and hotter disk regions, thus
providing a useful tool to map the accretion disk which is otherwise
unresolvable. In this work we compare the UV/optical variations of RL quasars
in SDSS Stripe 82 to those of several RQ samples, including those matched in
redshift-luminosity-black hole mass and/or color-magnitude. We find that while
both RL and RQ populations appear bluer when they brighten, RL quasars
potentially show a weaker/flatter dependence on timescale in their color
variation. We further find that while both RL and RQ populations on average
show similar variation amplitudes at long timescales, fast variations of RL
sources appear weaker/smaller (at timescales of ~ 25 -- 300 days in the
observer's frame), and the difference is more prominent in the g-band than in
the r-band. Inhomogeneous disk simulations can qualitatively reproduce these
observed differences if the inner accretion disk of RL quasars fluctuates less
based on simple toy models. Though the implications are likely model dependent,
the discovery points to an interesting diagram that magnetic fields in RL
quasars may be prospectively stronger and play a key role in both jet launching
and the stabilization of the inner accretion disk.

whose definitive classification as either non-terminal eruptions or supernovae
remains elusive. A critical question is whether a surviving star can be
significantly obscured by dust formed from material ejected during the
transient. We use three lines of argument to show that the candidate surviving
stars are not significantly optically extincted ($\tau \lesssim 1$) by dust
formed in the transients. First, we use SED fits to new HST optical and near-IR
photometry. Second, neither source is becoming brighter as required by
absorption from an expanding shell of ejected material. Third, the ejecta
masses implied by the H$\alpha$ luminosities are too low to produce significant
dust absorption. The latter two arguments hold independent of the dust
properties. The H$\alpha$ fluxes should also be declining with time as
$t^{-3}$, and this seems not to be observed. As a result, it seems unlikely
that recently formed dust can be responsible for the present faintness of the
sources compared to their progenitors, although this can be verified with
\textit{JWST}. This leaves three possibilities: 1) the survivors were
misidentified; 2) they are intrinsically less luminous; 3) SN 1954J and SN
1961V were true supernovae.

propagation of information across the structure of the board to accurately
detect and identify various types of components on a PCB. Due to the expense of
manual data labeling, a highly unbalanced distribution of component types, and
significant domain shift across boards, most earlier attempts based on
traditional image processing techniques fail to generalize well to PCB images
with various quality, lighting conditions, etc. Newer object detection
pipelines such as Faster R-CNN, on the other hand, require a large amount of
labeled data, do not deal with domain shift, and do not leverage structure. To
address these issues, we propose a three stage pipeline in which a
class-agnostic region proposal network is followed by a low-shot similarity
prediction classifier. In order to exploit the data dependency within a PCB, we
design a novel Graph Network block to refine the component features conditioned

to train a deep learning based model for such tasks, and we demonstrate
improvements over recent graph networks for this task. We also provide in-depth

However, their expressions as scaling relations are predicated on homology

the evolution of the acoustic turning points of the asteroseismic mode cavity,

us to use a single expression to accurately estimate the large frequency
separations of main-sequence, ascending red giant branch, and red clump stellar

Plasma parameters are measured during compression. The instances of ion heating

form a dense disk structure and launch tightly collimated magneto-centrifugal
jets and wide-angle winds. Our high-resolution simulations can resolve a
magneto-centrifugal jet and a magnetic pressure-driven outflow, separately. The
nature of the outflows depends critically on spatial resolution. Only
high-resolution simulations are able to differentiate a magneto-centrifugally
launched, highly collimated jet from a slow wide-angle magnetic-pressure-driven
tower flow. Of these two outflow components, the tower flow dominates
angular-momentum transport. The mass outflow rate is dominated by the entrained
material from the interaction of the jet with the stellar environment and only
part of the ejected medium is directly launched from the accretion disk. A
tower flow can only develop to its full extent when much of the original
envelope has already dispersed. Taking into account both the mass launched from
the surface of the disk and the entrained material from the envelope, we find
an ejection-to-accretion efficiency of 10%. Nonideal MHD is required to form
centrifugally supported accretion disks and the disk size is strongly dependent

=$ 13 TeV. Both decay channels result in a final state with a top quark, a
Higgs boson, and a b quark, each produced with significant energy. The
all-hadronic decays of both the Higgs boson and the top quark are considered.
The final-state jets, some of which correspond to merged decay products of a
boosted top quark and a Higgs boson, are selected using jet substructure
techniques, which help to suppress standard model backgrounds. A W' boson
signal would appear as a narrow peak in the invariant mass distribution of
these jets. No significant deviation in data with respect to the standard model
background predictions is observed. Cross section upper limits on W' boson
production in the top quark, Higgs boson, and b quark decay mode are set as a
function of the W' mass, for several vector-like quark mass hypotheses. These
are the first limits for W' boson production in this decay channel, and cover a
range of 0.01 to 0.43 pb in the W' mass range between 1.5 and 4.0 TeV.

reachability analysis to define a performance metric measuring the robustness
of each controller against parameter uncertainty, and choose the best
controller from the pool with respect to this metric. Then, we replace the
presumed shoulder control with an Iterative Learning Control algorithm as a
substitute for human experiments. Indeed this algorithm obtains torque and
forces at the shoulders that result in successful simulations of the
sit-to-stand movement, regardless of parameter uncertainty and factors
deliberately introduced to hinder learning. Thus it is reasonable to expect
that the superior cognitive skills of real users will enable them to cooperate

`close-to-open' event becomes `open-to-close', which is by default handled
correctly. At the core of our approach lies a general, topology-agnostic warp

explicitly detect regions of the deformed geometry that undergo topological

`contacts' or `separations'. Subsequently, the two motion hypotheses are
seamlessly blended on a local basis, according to the type and proximity of

degrees $c\in \{0, 1, \cdots, m\}$, for some integer $m \geq 0$, with relations
generated by a superpotential of degree $m-1$. Ordinary quivers ($m=1)$ often
describe the open string sector of D-brane systems; in particular, they capture
the physics of D3-branes at local Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold singularities in type
IIB string theory, in the guise of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric quiver
gauge theories. It was pointed out recently that graded quivers with $m=2$ and
$m=3$ similarly describe systems of D-branes at CY 4-fold and 5-fold
singularities, as 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ and 0d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories,

$m$-graded quivers with superpotential, $Q_{(m)}$, and CY $(m+2)$-fold

functions, the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also presents aspects related to

More, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory brain states, in addition to
cortical connectivity disruptions, are at the source of the autistic behavior.
Our main goal consists in unveiling the way by which these local excitatory
imbalances and/or long brain connections disruptions are linked to the above
mentioned cognitive features. We developed a theoretical model based on
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), where a three-level artificial neural network
qualitatively incorporates these kinds of alterations observed in brains of
patients with ASD. Computational simulations of our model indicate that high
excitatory states or long distance under-connectivity are at the origins of
cognitive alterations, as difficulty in categorization and mental rigidity.
More specifically, the enlargement of excitatory synaptic reach areas in a
cortical map development conducts to low categorization (over-selectivity) and
poor concepts formation. And, both the over-strengthening of local excitatory
synapses and the long distance under-connectivity, although through distinct
mechanisms, contribute to impaired categorization (under-selectivity) and
mental rigidity. Our results indicate how, together, both local and global
brain connectivity alterations give rise to spoiled cortical structures in
distinct ways and in distinct cortical areas. These alterations would disrupt
the codification of sensory stimuli, the representation of concepts and, thus,
the process of categorization - by this way imposing serious limits to the
mental flexibility and to the capacity of generalization in the autistic
reasoning.

us to determine the stream's leading and trailing ends. Our models suggest the
length of the stream is consistent with a dynamical age of between 2-3 Gyr and
the exact length, width and location of the GD-1 stream correspond to the
stream's progenitor being located between $-30^\circ < \phi_{1,\mathrm{pro}} <
-45^{\circ}$ in the standard GD-1 coordinate system. The model stream density
profiles reveal that intact progenitors leave a strong over-density,
recently-dissolved progenitors appear as gaps in the stream as escaped stars
continue to move away from the remnant progenitor's location, and
long-dissolved progenitors leave no observational signature on the remaining
stream. Comparing our models to the GD-1 stream yields two possible scenarios
for its progenitor's history: a) the progenitor reached dissolution
approximately 500 Myr ago during the cluster's previous perigalactic pass and
is both located at and responsible for the observed gap at $\phi_1=-40^{\circ}$
or b) the progenitor reached dissolution over 2.5 Gyr ago, the fully-dissolved
remnant is at $-30^\circ < \phi_1 < -45^{\circ}$, and an observational
signature of its location no longer exists. That the dissolved progenitor is in
the range $-30^\circ < \phi_1 < -45^{\circ}$ implies that density fluctuations

is an important task for many entity-leveraging applications. Previous work
either rank terms based on their similarity to a given query term, or treats
the problem as a two-phase task (i.e., detecting synonymy pairs, followed by
organizing these pairs into synonym sets). However, these approaches fail to
model the holistic semantics of a set and suffer from the error propagation
issue. Here we propose a new framework, named SynSetMine, that efficiently
generates entity synonym sets from a given vocabulary, using example sets from
external knowledge bases as distant supervision. SynSetMine consists of two
novel modules: (1) a set-instance classifier that jointly learns how to
represent a permutation invariant synonym set and whether to include a new
instance (i.e., a term) into the set, and (2) a set generation algorithm that
enumerates the vocabulary only once and applies the learned set-instance
classifier to detect all entity synonym sets in it. Experiments on three real
datasets from different domains demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency
of SynSetMine for mining entity synonym sets.

understand both lexical and compositional semantics. However, through
adversarial evaluation, we find that several state-of-the-art models with
diverse architectures are over-relying on the former and fail to use the
latter. Further, this compositionality unawareness is not reflected via
standard evaluation on current datasets. We show that removing RNNs in existing
models or shuffling input words during training does not induce large
performance loss despite the explicit removal of compositional information.
Therefore, we propose a compositionality-sensitivity testing setup that
analyzes models on natural examples from existing datasets that cannot be
solved via lexical features alone (i.e., on which a bag-of-words model gives a
high probability to one wrong label), hence revealing the models' actual
compositionality awareness. We show that this setup not only highlights the
limited compositional ability of current NLI models, but also differentiates
model performance based on design, e.g., separating shallow bag-of-words models
from deeper, linguistically-grounded tree-based models. Our evaluation setup is
an important analysis tool: complementing currently existing adversarial and
linguistically driven diagnostic evaluations, and exposing opportunities for
future work on evaluating models' compositional understanding.

capacity, a discretization of the unit sphere. This requires bounds on the norm
of the matrix, and the latter bounds require strong assumptions on the
distribution of the entries, such as bounded fourth moments (for a weak
estimate), sub-gaussian tails (for a strong estimate), and structural
assumptions such as mean zero and variance one. Recently, Rebrova and
Tikhomirov developed a discretization procedure which does not rely on strong
tail assumptions for the entries. However, their argument still required the
structural assumptions of mean zero, variance one i.i.d. entries.
  In this paper, we discuss an efficient discretization of the unit sphere,
which works with exponentially high probability, does not require any such
structural assumptions, and, furthermore, does not require independence of the
rows of the matrix. We show the existence of nets near the sphere, which
compare values of any (deterministic) random matrix on the sphere and on the
net via the regularized the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, which we introduce. Such
refinement is a form of averaging, and enjoys strong large deviation
properties. As a consequence we show sharp small ball estimates for the
smallest singular value of square random matrices under mild assumptions, and
for the random matrices with arbitrary aspect ratio.

a connected system consisting of three homogeneous neural semantic matching

retrieval (document retrieval and sentence selection), unlike traditional
vector space IR models in which queries and sources are matched in some
pre-designed term vector space, we develop neural models to perform deep
semantic matching from raw textual input, assuming no intermediate term
representation and no access to structured external knowledge bases. We also
show that Pageview frequency can also help improve the performance of evidence
retrieval results, that later can be matched by using our neural semantic

simply feed upstream retrieved evidence and the claim to a natural language

internal semantic relatedness scores (hence integrating it with the evidence
retrieval modules) and ontological WordNet features. Experiments on the FEVER
dataset indicate that (1) our neural semantic matching method outperforms
popular TF-IDF and encoder models, by significant margins on all evidence

improve the NLI model via better semantic awareness, and (3) by formalizing all

  Stochastic gradient descent is the de facto algorithm for training deep
neural networks (DNNs). Despite its popularity, it still requires fine tuning
in order to achieve its best performance. This has led to the development of
adaptive methods, that claim automatic hyper-parameter optimization. Recently,
researchers have studied both algorithmic classes via toy examples: e.g., for
over-parameterized linear regression, Wilson et. al. (2017) shows that, while
SGD always converges to the minimum-norm solution, adaptive methods show no
such inclination, leading to worse generalization capabilities. Our aim is to
study this conjecture further. We empirically show that the minimum weight norm
is not necessarily the proper gauge of good generalization in simplified
scenaria, and different models found by adaptive methods could outperform plain
gradient methods. In practical DNN settings, we observe that adaptive methods
can outperform SGD, with larger weight norm output models, but without
necessarily reducing the amount of tuning required.

problem to model them jointly. In this paper, we first present a new variant of
Long Short-Term Memory, namely Relational LSTM, to address the challenge of
relation reasoning across space and time between objects. In our Relational
LSTM module, we utilize a non-local operation similar in spirit to the recently
proposed non-local network to substitute the fully connected operation in the

principled way. Then, we propose a two-branch neural architecture consisting of
the Relational LSTM module as the non-local branch and a spatio-temporal
pooling based local branch. The local branch is utilized for capturing local
spatial appearance and/or short-term motion features. The two branches are
concatenated to learn video-level features from snippet-level ones which are

listeners in a reverberant room using a set of loudspeakers. We propose two
methods based on emitting noise. In the first method, the loudspeakers emit
noise signals that are appropriately filtered so that after echoing along
multiple paths in the room, they sum up and descramble to yield distinct
meaningful audio messages only at specific focusing spots, while being
incoherent everywhere else. In the second method, adapted from wireless
communications, we project noise signals onto the nullspace of the MIMO channel
matrix between the loudspeakers and listeners. Loudspeakers reproduce a sum of
the projected noise signals and intended messages. Again because of echoes, the
MIMO nullspace changes across different locations in the room. Thus, the
listeners at focusing spots hear intended messages, while the acoustic channel
of an eavesdropper at any other location is jammed. We show, using both
numerical and real experiments, that with a small number of speakers and a few
impulse response measurements, audio messages can indeed be communicated to a
set of listeners while ensuring negligible intelligibility elsewhere.

based on homogeneous optical ($BVI$) and near-infrared ($JHK$) mean magnitudes
and on predicted period--luminosity--metallicity relations ($IJHK$) and
absolute mean magnitude--metallicity relations ($BV$). We obtained solutions
for three different RRL samples in $\omega$ Cen: first overtone (RRc,~90),
fundamental (RRab,~80) and global (RRc+RRab) in which the period of first
overtones were fundamentalized. The metallicity distribution shows a well
defined peak at [Fe/H]$\sim$--1.98 and a standard deviation of $\sigma$=0.54
dex. The spread is, as expected, metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\le$--2.3) objects. The
current metallicity distribution is $\sim$0.3 dex more metal-poor than similar
estimates for RRLs available in the literature. The difference vanishes if the
true distance modulus we estimated is offset by --0.06/--0.07~mag in true
distance modulus. We also found a cluster true distance modulus of
$\mu$=13.720$\pm$0.002$\pm$0.030~mag, where the former error is the error on
the mean and the latter is the standard deviation. Moreover, we found a cluster
reddening of E($B-V$)=0.132$\pm$0.002$\pm$0.028~mag and spatial variations of
the order of a few arcmin across the body of the cluster. Both the true
distance modulus and the reddening are slightly larger than similar estimates
available in the literature, but the difference is within 1$\sigma$. The
metallicity dependence of distance diagnostics agree with theory and
observations, but firm constraints require accurate and homogeneous
spectroscopic measurements.

supervised images (having semantic segmentation labels and box labels) and a
set of images with only object bounding box labels (we call it the weak set).
Our framework trains the primary segmentation model with the aid of an
ancillary model that generates initial segmentation labels for the weak set and
a self-correction module that improves the generated labels during training
using the increasingly accurate primary model. We introduce two variants of the
self-correction module using either linear or convolutional functions.
Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscape datasets show that our models
trained with a small fully supervised set perform similar to, or better than,
models trained with a large fully supervised set while requiring ~7x less

re-constructed using the Kiepencheuer-Institut Speckle Interferometry Package
(KISIP) code, to improve our image resolution. We observed intensity increases
of $\approx$120-150% in the Mg, Ca~K and H$\alpha$ narrow band filters during
the flare. Intensity increases for the flare observed in the SDO EUV channels
were several times larger, and the GOES X-rays increased over a factor of 30
for the harder band. Only a modest delay is found between the onset of flare
ribbons of a nearby sympathetic flare and the main flare ribbons observed in
these narrow-band filters. The peak flare emission occurs within a few seconds
for the Ca~K, Mg, and H$\alpha$ bands. Time-distance techniques find
propagation velocities of $\approx$60 km/s for the main flare ribbon and as
high as 300 km/s for smaller regions we attribute to filament eruptions. This
result and delays and velocities observed with SDO ($\approx$100 km/s) for
different coronal heights agree well with the simple model of energy
propagation versus height, although a more detailed model for the flaring solar
atmosphere is needed. And finally, we detected marginal quasi-periodic

wide possible applications. The key issues are how to extract discriminative
features and how to design the classification model. In this paper, we first
leverage a robust feature descriptor, path signature (PS), and propose three PS
features to explicitly represent the spatial and temporal motion
characteristics, i.e., spatial PS (S_PS), temporal PS (T_PS) and temporal
spatial PS (T_S_PS). Considering the significance of fine hand movements in the
gesture, we propose an ""attention on hand"" (AOH) principle to define joint
pairs for the S_PS and select single joint for the T_PS. In addition, the
dyadic method is employed to extract the T_PS and T_S_PS features that encode
global and local temporal dynamics in the motion. Secondly, without the
recurrent strategy, the classification model still faces challenges on temporal
variation among different sequences. We propose a new temporal transformer
module (TTM) that can match the sequence key frames by learning the temporal
shifting parameter for each input. This is a learning-based module that can be
included into standard neural network architecture. Finally, we design a
multi-stream fully connected layer based network to treat spatial and temporal
features separately and fused them together for the final result. We have
tested our method on three benchmark gesture datasets, i.e., ChaLearn 2016,
ChaLearn 2013 and MSRC-12. Experimental results demonstrate that we achieve the

of everyday sounds across 20,000 crowd-sourced aural memory games, and assess
the degree to which a sound's memorability is constant across subjects. We then
use this data to analyze the relationship between memorability and acoustic
features like harmonicity, spectral skew, and models of cognitive salience; we
also assess the relationship between memorability and high-level features with
a dependence on the sound source itself, such as its familiarity, valence,
arousal, source type, causal certainty, and verbalizability. We find that (1)
our crowd-sourced measures of memorability and confusability are reliable and
robust across participants; (2) that the authors' measure of collective causal

Thus far, all proposed synergy-based systems rely on matrix factorisation

potential application of higher-order tensor decomposition as a framework for
proportional myoelectric control is demonstrated. A novel constrained Tucker
decomposition (consTD) technique of synergy extraction is proposed for
synergy-based myoelectric control model and compared with state-of-the-art
matrix factorisation models. The extracted synergies were used to estimate
control signals for the wrist's Degree of Freedom (DoF) through direct
projection. The consTD model was able to estimate the control signals for each
DoF by utilising all data in one 3rd-order tensor. This is contrast with matrix
factorisation models where data are segmented for each DoF and then the
synergies often have to be realigned. Moreover, the consTD method offers more
information by providing additional shared synergies, unlike matrix
factorisation methods. The extracted control signals were fed to a ridge
regression to estimate the wrist's kinematics based on real glove data. The
Coefficient of Determination (R2) for the reconstructed wrist position showed
that the proposed consTD was higher than matrix factorisation methods. In sum,
this study provides the first proof of concept for the use of higher-order
tensor decomposition in proportional myoelectric control and it highlights the
potential of tensors to provide an objective and direct approach to identify
synergies.

can lead to substantial challenges for segmentation algorithms, particularly
supervised methods. These methods require atlases or training data, which are
composed of MR image and labeled image pairs. In most cases, the training data
are obtained with a fixed acquisition protocol, leading to suboptimal
performance when an input data set that requires segmentation has differing
contrast properties. This drawback is increasingly significant with the recent
movement towards multi-center research studies involving multiple scanners and
acquisition protocols. In this work, we propose a new framework for supervised
segmentation approaches that is robust to contrast differences between the
training MR image and the input image. Our approach uses a generative
simulation model within the segmentation process to compensate for the contrast
differences. We allow the contrast of the MR image in the training data to vary
by simulating a new contrast from the corresponding label image. The model
parameters are optimized by a cost function measuring the consistency between
the input MR image and its simulation based on a current estimate of the
segmentation labels. We provide a proof of concept of this approach by
combining a supervised classifier with a simple simulation model, and apply the
resulting algorithm to synthetic images and actual MR images.

subscription aggregation techniques can be useful to reduce the amount of
subscription dissemination traffic and the subscription table size by
exploiting the similarity among subscriptions, efficient subscription
aggregation is not a trivial task to accomplish. Previous research works have
proved that it is either a NP-Complete or a co-NP complete problem. In this
paper, we propose DLS (Discrete Label Set), a novel subscription representation
model, and design algorithms to achieve the mapping from traditional Boolean
predicate model to the DLS model. Based on the DLS model, we propose a
subscription aggregation algorithm with O(1) time complexity in most cases, and
an event matching algorithm with O(1) time complexity. The significant
performance improvement is at the cost of memory consumption and controllable
false positive rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that these algorithms are
inherently scalable and can achieve real time event matching in a large-scale
content-based publish/subscribe network. We discuss the tradeoff between
memory, false positive rate and partition granules of content space.
Experimental results show that proposed algorithms achieve expected
performance. With the increasing of computer memory capacity and the dropping

The key idea of the proposed solution is to leverage mmWave imaging to
construct a high-resolution 3D image of the line-of-sight (LOS) and
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) objects in the environment at one antenna array. Then,
uplink pilot signaling with the user is used to estimate the angle-of-arrival
and time-of-arrival of the dominant channel paths. By projecting the AoA and
ToA information on the 3D mmWave images of the environment, the proposed
solution can locate the user with a sub-centimeter accuracy. This approach has
several gains. First, it allows accurate simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) from a single standpoint, i.e., using only one antenna array. Second, it
does not require any prior knowledge of the surrounding environment. Third, it
can locate NLOS users, even if their signals experience more than one
reflection and without requiring an antenna array at the user. The approach is
evaluated using a hardware setup and its ability to provide sub-centimeter
localization accuracy is shown.

nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), large genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
have been considered as the promise to unravel the complex relationships
between genotypes and phenotypes, in particularly common diseases. However,
current multi-locus-based methods are insufficient, in terms of computational
cost and discrimination power, to detect statistically significant interactions
and they are lacking in the ability of finding diverse genetic effects on
multifarious diseases. Especially, multiple statistic tests for high-order
epistasis ($ \geq $ 2 SNPs) will raise huge analytical challenges because the
computational cost increases exponentially as the growth of the cardinality of
SNPs in an epistatic module. In this paper, we develop a simple, fast and
powerful method, named JS-MA, using the Jensen-Shannon divergence and a
high-dimensional $ k $-mean clustering algorithm for mapping the genome-wide
multi-locus epistatic interactions on multiple diseases. Compared with some
state-of-the-art association mapping tools, our method is demonstrated to be
more powerful and efficient from the experimental results on the systematical
simulations. We also applied JS-MA to the GWAS datasets from WTCCC for two
common diseases, i.e. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Type 1 Diabetes. JS-MA not only
confirms some recently reported biologically meaningful associations but also
identifies some novel findings. Therefore, we believe that our method is
suitable and efficient for the full-scale analysis of multi-disease-related
interactions in the large GWASs.

straightforwardly generalized to other nonlinear optical effects. Our scheme
can offer a deeper understanding on the interaction of vectorial light with

our model directly generates realistic context and background pixels based on
the features of the provided face mask. Unlike face inpainting algorithms, it
can generate realistic hallucinations even for a large number of missing
pixels. Our model is composed of a cascaded network of GAN blocks, each tasked
with hallucination of missing pixels at a particular resolution while guiding
the synthesis process of the next GAN block. The hallucinated full face image
is made photo-realistic by using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual,
adversarial and identity preserving losses at each block of the network. With a
set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in
hallucinating context and background pixels from face masks varying in facial
pose, expression and lighting, collected from multiple datasets subject
disjoint with our training data. We also compare our method with two popular

originate from hadronic interactions of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei with the
interstellar medium. It has recently been shown that the gamma-ray luminosity
($L_\gamma$) of star-forming galaxies is well correlated with their star
formation rates (SFR). We investigated \textsl{Fermi} data of eight Galactic
molecular clouds in the Gould belt and found that molecular clouds do not
follow the $L_\gamma-{\rm SFR}$ correlation of star-forming galaxies. We also
compared the scaling relations of gamma-ray luminosity, SFR, and the gas mass
for molecular clouds and star-forming galaxies. Using a multiple-variable
regression analysis, we found different dependences of gamma-ray emission on
SFR or mass for molecular clouds and star-forming galaxies. This suggests that
different mechanisms may govern the production of gamma-rays in these two types
of sources. Specifically, the strong dependence on mass supports that gamma-ray
emission of molecular clouds primarily comes from {\em \textup{passive}}
interaction by diffuse Galactic CRs, whereas the strong dependence on SFR
supports that gamma-ray emission of star-forming galaxies originates from CRs
that are accelerated by local {\em \textup{active}} sources.

to explode in the sub-Chandrasekhar mass regime. Previous studies have shown
how the ignition of a helium shell can either directly ignite the WD at the
core-shell interface or propagate a shock wave into the the core causing a
central ignition. We examine the explosions of WDs from 0.6 - 1.2 M$_\odot$
with helium shells of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.08 M$_\odot$. Distinct observational
signatures of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD explosions are predicted for two
categories of shell size. Thicker-shell models show an early time flux excess,
which is caused by the presence of radioactive material in the ashes of the
helium shell, and red colors due to these ashes creating significant line
blanketing in the UV through the blue portion of the spectrum. Thin shell
models reproduce several typical Type Ia supernova signatures. We identify a
relationship between Si II velocity and luminosity which, for the first time,
identifies a sub-class of observed supernovae that are consistent with these
models. This sub-class is further delineated by the absence of carbon in their
atmospheres. We suggest that the proposed difference in the ratio of selective
to total extinction between the high velocity and normal velocity Type Ia
supernovae is not due to differences in the properties of the dust around these
events, but is rather an artifact of applying a single extinction correction to
two intrinsically different populations of supernovae.

is referred to as Discriminative Encoding for Domain Adaptation (DEDA). We show

also obtained state of the art performance on domain adaptation in Amazon

substantially reduced 2-4 billion years ago, which is inconsistent with
substantial evidence for warm and wet conditions in the geological records of
both ancient Earth and Mars. Typical solutions to this so-called ""faint young
Sun paradox"" consider changes in the atmospheric composition of Earth and Mars,
and while attractive, geological verification of these ideas is generally
lacking-particularly for Mars. One possible underexplored solution to the faint
young Sun paradox is that the Sun has simply lost a few percent of its mass
during its lifetime. If correct, this would slow, or potentially even offset
the increase in luminosity expected from a constant-mass model. However, this
hypothesis is challenging to test. Here, we propose a novel observational proxy
of the Sun's ancient mass that may be readily measured from accumulation
patterns in sedimentary rocks on Earth and Mars. We show that the orbital
parameters of the Solar system planets undergo quasi-cyclic oscillations at a
frequency, given by secular mode g_2-g_5, that scales approximately linearly
with the Sun's mass. Thus by examining the cadence of sediment accumulation in
ancient basins, it is possible distinguish between the cases of a constant mass
Sun and a more massive ancient Sun to a precision of greater than about 1 per
cent. This approach provides an avenue toward verification, or of
falsification, of the massive early Sun hypothesis.

rectangular grid structure. This naturally leads to the idea of programming the
process at one grid position only and translating the motion to the other grid
points, saving teaching time. However this approach usually fails because of
joint limits or singularities of the robot. If the task description has some
redundancies, e.g. the objects are cylinders where one orientation angle is
free for the gripping process, the motion may be modified to avoid workspace
problems. We present a mathematical algorithm that allows the automatic
generation of robot programs for pick-and-place applications with structured
positions when the workpieces have some symmetry, resulting in a Cartesian
degree of freedom for the process. The optimization uses the idea of a virtual
joint which measures the distance of the desired TCP to the workspace such that
the nonlinear optimization method is not bothered with unreachable positions.
Combined with smoothed versions of the functions in the nonlinear program
higher order algorithms can be used, with theoretical justification superior to
many ad-hoc approaches used so far.

protein solubility can represent the function and activity of biocatalysts

more effective in biocatalytic processes and can reduce the cost of
biocatalysts. Screening proteins by experiments in vivo is time-consuming and
expensive. In literature, large amounts of machine learning models have been
investigated, whereas parameters of those models are underdetermined with
insufficient data of protein solubility. A data augmentation algorithm that can
enlarge the dataset of protein solubility and improve the performance of
prediction model is highly desired, which can alleviate the common issue of
insufficient data in biotechnology applications for developing machine learning
models. We first implemented a novel approach that a data augmentation
algorithm, conditional WGAN was used to improve prediction performance of DNN
for protein solubility from protein sequence by generating artificial data.
After adding mimic data produced from conditional WGAN, the prediction
performance represented by $R^{2}$ was improved compared with the $R^{2}$

enhanced $R^{2}$ about $10\%$ compared with the previous study using the same

multiscale transport with the updates of both gas distribution function and
macroscopic flow variables on the cell size and time step scales. The
multiscale dynamics in UGKS is achieved through the coupled particle transport
and collision in the particle evolution process within a time step. In this
paper, under the UGKS framework, we propose an efficient multiscale unified
gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method. The gas dynamics in UGKWP method is
described by the individual particle movement coupled with the evolution of the
probability density function (PDF). During a time step, the trajectories of
simulation particles are tracked until collision happens, and the
post-collision particles are evolved collectively through the evolution of the
corresponding distribution function. The evolution of simulation particles and
distribution function is guided by evolution of macroscopic variables. The two
descriptions on a gas particle, i.e. wave and particle, switch dynamically with
time. A new concept of multiscale multi-efficiency preserving (MMP) method is
introduced, and the UGKWP method is shown to be an MMP scheme. The UGKWP method
is specially efficient for hypersonic flow simulation in all regimes in
comparison with the wave-type discrete ordinate methods, and presents a much
lower stochastic noise in the continuum flow regime in comparison with the
particle-based Monte Carlo methods. Numerical tests for flows over a wide range
of Mach and Knudsen numbers are presented. The examples include mainly the
hypersonic flow passing a circular cylinder at Mach numbers $20$ and $30$ and

traffic is sent over anonymity-preserving networks such as Tor. The classical
attack model used to evaluate website fingerprinting attacks assumes an on-path
adversary, who can observe all traffic traveling between the user's computer
and the Tor network. In this work we investigate these attacks under a
different attack model, in which the adversary is capable of running a small
amount of unprivileged code on the target user's computer. Under this model,
the attacker can mount cache side-channel attacks, which exploit the effects of
contention on the CPU's cache, to identify the website being browsed. In an
important special case of this attack model, a JavaScript attack is launched
when the target user visits a website controlled by the attacker. The
effectiveness of this attack scenario has never been systematically analyzed,
especially in the open-world model which assumes that the user is visiting a
mix of both sensitive and non-sensitive sites. In this work we show that cache
website fingerprinting attacks in JavaScript are highly feasible, even when
they are run from highly restrictive environments, such as the Tor Browser.
Specifically, we use machine learning techniques to classify traces of cache
activity. Unlike prior works, which try to identify cache conflicts, our work
measures the overall occupancy of the last-level cache. We show that our
approach achieves high classification accuracy in both the open-world and the
closed-world models. We further show that our techniques are resilient both to
network-based defenses and to side-channel countermeasures introduced to modern
browsers as a response to the Spectre attack.

emerged as dominant methods to capture spatiotemporal representations in
videos, by adding to pre-existing 2D CNNs a third, temporal dimension. Such 3D
CNNs, however, are anti-causal (i.e., they exploit information from both the
past and the future frames to produce feature representations, thus preventing
their use in online settings), constrain the temporal reasoning horizon to the
size of the temporal convolution kernel, and are not temporal
resolution-preserving for video sequence-to-sequence modelling, as, for
instance, in action detection. To address these serious limitations, here we
present a new 3D CNN architecture for the causal/online processing of videos.
  Namely, we propose a novel Recurrent Convolutional Network (RCN), which
relies on recurrence to capture the temporal context across frames at each
network level. Our network decomposes 3D convolutions into (1) a 2D spatial
convolution component, and (2) an additional hidden state $1\times 1$
convolution, applied across time. The hidden state at any time $t$ is assumed
to depend on the hidden state at $t-1$ and on the current output of the spatial
convolution component. As a result, the proposed network: (i) produces causal
outputs, (ii) provides flexible temporal reasoning, (iii) preserves temporal
resolution. Our experiments on the large-scale large Kinetics and MultiThumos
datasets show that the proposed method performs comparably to anti-causal 3D
CNNs, while being causal and using fewer parameters.

action is finite (although not unambiguously defined) for discontinuous tetrad
fields thus allowing, in particular, to consider a surface as consisting of
virtually independent elementary triangles, and its area spectrum as the sum of

the elementary area spectrum, which is nonsingular just at large connection or
the strongly varying fields constituting a kind of ""antiferromagnetic""

unambiguously determine the discrete Faddeev action for the strongly varying

a sparsity regularizer and a cross-scale non-local regularizer based on our
patch priors. It has been observed that our regularizers often favor sharp
images over blurry ones only for image patches of the salient edges and thus we
define an edge mask to locate salient edges that we want to apply our
regularizers. Experimental results on both simulated and real blurry images
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art blind
deblurring methods even for handling of very large blurs, thanks to the use of
the edge mask.

compare with data from photoabsorption and Coulomb excitation experiments. The
single-particle propagator is obtained by solving the Dyson equation, where the
self-energy includes correlations non-perturbatively through the Algebraic
Diagrammatic Construction (ADC) method. The particle-hole ($ph$) polarization
propagator is treated in the Dressed Random Phase Approximation (DRPA), based
on an effective correlated propagator that includes some $2p2h$ effects but
keeps the same computation scaling as the standard Hartree-Fock propagator. The
E1 responses for $^{14,16,22,24}$O, $^{36,40,48,52,54,70}$Ca and $^{68}$Ni have
been computed: the presence of a soft dipole mode of excitation for
neutron-rich nuclei is found, and there is a fair reproduction of the
low-energy part of the experimental excitation spectrum. This is reflected in a
good agreement with the empirical dipole polarizability values. For a realistic
interaction with an accurate reproduction of masses and radii up to medium-mass

auctions through a proxy bidder, so the standard incentive analyses that are
common in the literature do not apply directly. In this paper, we take the
perspective of a budget management system that surfaces aggregated incentives
-- instead of individual auctions -- and compare first and second price
auctions. We show that theory offers surprising endorsement for using a first
price auction to sell individual impressions. In particular, first price
auctions guarantee uniqueness of the steady-state equilibrium of the budget
management system, monotonicity, and other desirable properties, as well as
efficient computation through the solution to the well-studied Eisenberg-Gale
convex program. Contrary to what one can expect from first price auctions, we
show that incentives issues are not a barrier that undermines the system. Using
realistic instances generated from data collected at real-world auction
platforms, we show that bidders have small regret with respect to their optimal
ex-post strategy, and they do not have a big incentive to misreport when they
can influence equilibria directly by giving inputs strategically. Finally,
budget-constrained bidders, who have significant prevalence in real-world
platforms, tend to have smaller regrets. Our computations indicate that bidder
budgets, pacing multipliers and regrets all have a positive association in

stronger notions of generic computability and coarse computability, which
correspond respectively to requiring in addition that $g$ and $f$ agree on the

notions, call a function $g$ effectively densely computable if it has a partial
computable dense description $f$ such that the domain of $f$ is a computable

well as asymptotic approximations to them that require for each $\epsilon > 0$
the existence of an appropriate description that is correct on a set of lower
density of at least $1 - \epsilon$. We determine which implications hold among
these various notions of approximate computability and show that any Boolean
combination of these notions is satisfied by a c.e. set unless it is ruled out
by these implications. We define reducibilities corresponding to dense and
effectively dense reducibility and show that their uniform and nonuniform

degrees into the corresponding degree structures, and that these embeddings are
not surjective and indeed that sufficiently random sets have quasiminimal

developing of just how critical an awareness of the sensitivity and robustness
of certain target variables are to changes in the model. When time resources
are limited, such issues impact directly on the chosen level of complexity of
the BN as well as the quantity of missing probabilities we are able to elicit.
Currently most such analyses are performed once the whole BN has been elicited
and are based on Kullback-Leibler information measures. In this paper we argue
that robustness methods based instead on the familiar total variation distance
provide simple and more useful bounds on robustness to misspecification which
are both formally justifiable and transparent. We demonstrate how such formal
robustness considerations can be embedded within the process of building a BN.

the solar system for 3 Myr, negating the possibility that heat retained from
the previous perihelion could be responsible for its activity. This inbound
comet is also too cold for water ice to sublimate and too cold for amorphous
water ice, if present, to crystallize. C/2017 K2 thus presents an ideal target
in which to investigate the mechanisms responsible for activity in distant
comets. We have used Hubble Space Telescope to study the comet in the
pre-perihelion distance range 13.8 to 15.9 AU. The coma maintains a logarithmic
surface brightness gradient $m = -1.010\pm$0.004, consistent with steady-state
mass loss. The absence of a radiation pressure swept tail indicates that the
effective particle size is large (0.1 mm) and the mass loss rate is $\sim$200
kg s$^{-1}$, remarkable for a comet still beyond the orbit of Saturn.
Extrapolation of the photometry indicates that activity began in 2012.1, at
25.9$\pm$0.9 AU, where the blackbody temperature is only 55 K. This large
distance and low temperature suggest that cometary activity is driven by the
sublimation of a super-volatile ice (e.g.~CO), presumably preserved by K2's
long-term residence in the Oort cloud. The mass loss rate can be sustained by
CO sublimation from an area $\lesssim 2$ km$^2$, if located near the hot
sub-solar point on the nucleus. However, while the drag force from sublimated
CO is sufficient to lift millimeter sized particles against the gravity of the
cometary nucleus, it is 10$^2$ to 10$^3$ times too small to eject these
particles against inter-particle cohesion. Our observations thus require either
a new understanding of the physics of inter-particle cohesion or the
introduction of another mechanism to drive distant cometary mass loss. We
suggest thermal fracture and electrostatic supercharging in this context.

is the levitated ball. Several full-state feedback controllers that ensure
asymptotic regulation of the ball position have been reported in the
literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, the design of a stabilizing
law measuring only the current and the voltage - so-called sensorless control -
is conspicuous by its absence. Besides its unquestionable theoretical interest,
the high cost and poor reliability of position sensors for magnetic levitated
systems, makes the problem of great practical application. Our main
contribution is to provide the fist solution to this problem. Instrumental for
the development of the theory is the use of parameter estimation-based
observers, which combined with the dynamic regressor extension and mixing
parameter estimation technique, allow the reconstruction of the magnetic flux.
With the knowledge of the latter it is shown that the mechanical coordinates
can be estimated with suitably tailored nonlinear observers. Replacing the
observed states, in a certainty equivalent manner, with a full information
asymptotically stabilising law completes the sensorless controller design.
Simulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed
scheme.

slow learning speeds, particularly in high dimensional spaces. Decomposition of
tasks into a hierarchical structure holds the potential to significantly speed
up learning, generalization, and transfer learning. However, the current task
decomposition techniques often rely on high-level knowledge provided by an
expert (e.g. using dynamic Bayesian networks) to extract a hierarchical task
structure; which is not necessarily available in autonomous systems. In this
paper, we propose a novel method based on Sequential Association Rule Mining
that can extract Hierarchical Structure of Tasks in Reinforcement Learning
(SARM-HSTRL) in an autonomous manner for both Markov decision processes (MDPs)
and factored MDPs. The proposed method leverages association rule mining to
discover the causal and temporal relationships among states in different
trajectories, and extracts a task hierarchy that captures these relationships
among sub-goals as termination conditions of different sub-tasks. We prove that
the extracted hierarchical policy offers a hierarchically optimal policy in
MDPs and factored MDPs. It should be noted that SARM-HSTRL extracts this
hierarchical optimal policy without having dynamic Bayesian networks in
scenarios with a single task trajectory and also with multiple tasks'
trajectories. Furthermore, it has been theoretically and empirically shown that
the extracted hierarchical task structure is consistent with trajectories and
provides the most efficient, reliable, and compact structure under appropriate
assumptions. The numerical results compare the performance of the proposed
SARM-HSTRL method with conventional HRL algorithms in terms of the accuracy in
detecting the sub-goals, the validity of the extracted hierarchies, and the
speed of learning in several testbeds.

that the true minimum is given by the monopole condensation. To do this we make
the gauge independent Weyl symmetric Abelian decomposition of the SU(3) QCD
which decomposes the gluons to the color neutral neurons and the colored
chromons. In the perturbative regime this decomposes the Feynman diagram in
such a way that the conservation of color is explicit. Moreover, this shows the
existence of two gluon jets, the neuron jet and chromon jet, which can be
verified by experiment. In the non-perturbative regime, the decomposition puts
QCD to the background field formalism and reduces the non-Abelian gauge
symmetry to a discrete color reflection symmetry, and provides us an ideal
platform to calculate the one-loop effective action of QCD. Integrating out the
chromons from the Weyl symmetric Abelian decomposition of QCD gauge invariantly
imposing the color reflection invariance, we obtain the SU(3) QCD effective
potential which generates the stable monopole condensation and the mass gap. We
discuss the physical implications of our result, in particular the possible
existence of the vacuum fluctuation mode of the monopole condensation in QCD.

(T-F) domain which is obtained by the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The
properties of the STFT are fully characterized by window function, number of
frequency channels, and time-shift. Thus, designing a better window is
important for improving the performance of the processing especially when a
less redundant T-F representation is desirable. While many window functions
have been proposed in the literature, they are designed to have a good
frequency response for analysis, which may not perform well in terms of signal
processing. The window design must take the effect of the reconstruction (from
the T-F domain into the time domain) into account for improving the
performance. In this paper, an optimization-based design method of a nearly
tight window is proposed to obtain a window performing well for the T-F domain
signal processing.

minimum activity between Solar Cycles 23/24. Fortunately, the PAMELA
space-experiment measured six-month averaged Galactic positron spectra for the
period July 2006 to December 2009, over an energy range of 80 MeV to 30 GeV,
which is important for solar modulation. The highest level of Galactic
positrons was observed at Earth during the July-December 2009 period. A
well-established, comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) numerical model is
applied to study the modulation of the observed positron spectra. This model
had been used previously to understand the modulation of Galactic protons and
electrons also measured by PAMELA for the same period. First, a new very local
interstellar spectrum for positrons is constructed, using the well-known
GALPROP code together with the mentioned PAMELA observations. The 3D model is
used to distinguish between the dominant mechanisms responsible for the
heliospheric modulation of Galactic positrons, and to understand the effect of
particle drift during this unusual minimum in particular, which is considered
diffusion dominant, even though particle drift still had a significant role in
modulating positrons. Lastly, the expected intensity of Galactic positrons
during an A>0 polarity minimum, with similar heliospheric conditions than for
2006-2009, is predicted to be higher than what was observed by PAMELA for the
2006-2009 unusual minimum.

and Managed Forgetting (MF) technology. A key concept of the latter is the
so-called Memory Buoyancy (MB), which is intended to represent an information
item's current value for the user and allows to employ forgetting mechanisms.
The SD thus continuously performs information value assessment updating MB and
triggering respective MF measures. We extended an SD-based organizational
memory system, which we have been using in daily work for over seven years now,
with MF mechanisms directly embedding them in daily activities, too, and
enabling us to test and optimize them in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we first present our initial version of MB and discuss success and failure
stories we have been experiencing with it during three years of practical
usage. We learned from cognitive psychology that our previous research on
context can be beneficial for MF. Thus, we created an advanced MB version
especially taking user context, and in particular context switches, into
account. These enhancements as well as a first prototypical implementation are
presented, too.

  Colorectal Cancer Survival: A Density Regression Mediation Approach","15 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures",,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of racial/ethnic inequalities in health is important to reduce the
uneven burden of disease. In the case of colorectal cancer (CRC), disparities
in survival among non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks are well documented, and
mechanisms leading to these disparities need to be studied formally. It has
also been established that body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for
developing CRC, and recent literature shows BMI at diagnosis of CRC is
associated with survival. Since BMI varies by racial/ethnic group, a question
that arises is whether disparities in BMI is partially responsible for observed
racial/ethnic disparities in CRC survival. This paper presents new methodology
to quantify the impact of the hypothetical intervention that matches the BMI
distribution in the Black population to a potentially complex distributional
form observed in the White population on racial/ethnic disparities in survival.
We perform a simulation that shows our proposed Bayesian density regression
approach performs as well as or better than current methodology allowing for a
shift in the mean of the distribution only, and that standard practice of
categorizing BMI leads to large biases. When applied to motivating data from
the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium, our
approach suggests the proposed intervention is potentially beneficial for
elderly and low income Black patients, yet harmful for young and high income
Black populations.

the Coulomb potential mediated by plasmons. In contrast to previous studies, we
consider the contribution from the divergence of renormalized inverse electron
permittivity, which enhances Coulomb interaction at longer ranges. Our work
reveals that the Coulomb potential acquires oscillating terms, which for the
charged plane case could lead to a spatial heterostructure. In the resonant
case ($\omega_p = \Omega$), photoinduced Coulomb interaction becomes attractive
for small values of momenta. This Coulomb interaction renormalization could
potentially lead to instabilities in the electron system, such as
superconductivity and/or charge density waves. We found possible divergence of
the electron coupling constant and discuss herein a potential new mechanism of
superconductivity based on electron-electron interaction renormalization via
the plasmon oscillating electric field. We also briefly discuss possible
photoinduced $\epsilon$ near zero conditions.
