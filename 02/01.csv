  as a network optimization problem",,,,,"q-fin.RM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systemic risk arises as a multi-layer network phenomenon. Layers represent
direct financial exposures of various types, including interbank liabilities,
derivative- or foreign exchange exposures. Another network layer of systemic
risk emerges through common asset holdings of financial institutions. Strongly
overlapping portfolios lead to similar exposures that are caused by price
movements of the underlying financial assets. Based on the knowledge of
portfolio holdings of financial agents we quantify systemic risk of overlapping
portfolios. We present an optimization procedure, where we minimize the
systemic risk in a given financial market by optimally rearranging overlapping
portfolio networks, under the constraints that the expected returns and risks
of the individual portfolios are unchanged. We explicitly demonstrate the power
of the method on the overlapping portfolio network of sovereign exposure
between major European banks by using data from the European Banking Authority
stress test of 2016. We show that systemic-risk-efficient allocations are
accessible by the optimization. In the case of sovereign exposure, systemic
risk can be reduced by more than a factor of two, with- out any detrimental
effects for the individual banks. These results are confirmed by a simple
simulation of fire sales in the government bond market. In particular we show
that the contagion probability is reduced dramatically in the optimized
network.

challenging. Here we propose a novel Densely Dilated Spatial Pooling
Convolutional Network (DDSP ConNet) in encoder-decoder structure. It employs
dense structure to combine dilated convolution and global pooling, thus
supplies coarse segmentation results from encoder and decoder subnet and
preserves more contextual information. To obtain richer hierarchical feature
maps, residual long connection is furtherly adopted to fuse contexture
features. Meanwhile, we adopt DSC loss and Jaccard loss functions to train our
DDSP ConNet. We surprisingly found and proved that, in contrast to re-weighted
cross entropy, DSC loss and Jaccard loss have a lot of benign properties in
theory, including symmetry, continuity and differentiability about the
parameters of network. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI PROMISE12 challenge

either result in an uncontrolled skyrmion bubble production or are mostly
targeted towards integration with racetrack memory device. In this work, we
propose a novel scheme for a controlled single skyrmion nucleation in a
confined nanowire geometry with sub-100 nm width using a generalized approach
of ""localized spin current injection"" technique in material systems exhibiting
low Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Our proposed nucleation mechanism
follows a pathway involving the creation of a reversed magnetic domain
containing one or more pairs of vertical Bloch lines (VBLs) that form an
edge-to-edge domain wall as the VBLs get annihilated at the edge of the
nanowire. However, pinning of the edge domain walls within a narrow gap using
notches or anti-notches results in the creation of a magnetic bubble with
defect-free domain wall that eventually relaxes into a circular skyrmion
structure. Our simulations predict that the proposed mechanism allows skyrmion
nucleation on sub-nanosecond timescale, shows robustness to variations like
local pinning sites and is applicable for any skyrmion-based logic, memory and
interconnect application.

the set of invariant connections with totally skew-symmetric torsion whose

stochastic processes based on the mathematical structure defined by association
relationships as morphisms in category theory, so as to represent the
indeterminate nature of structure-structure interactions between the systems of
the meanings of images. Such interactions are formulated in terms of so-called
coslice categories and functors as structure-preserving correspondence between
them. The relationship between such functors is ""indeterminate natural
transformation"", the central notion in TINT, which models the creation of
meanings in a precise manner. For instance, the process of metaphor
comprehension is modeled by the construction of indeterminate natural
transformation from a canonically defined functor which we call the
base-of-metaphor functor.

populations in Brazil by studying the performance of a large cohort of senior
high-school students in a standardized national exam. We separate ethnic groups
into the Brazilian states to remove potential biases associated to
infrastructure and financial resources, cultural background and ethnic
clustering. We focus on the disciplines of mathematics and writing that involve
different cognitive functions. We estimate the gaps and their statistical
significance through the Welch's t-test and study key socio-economic variables
that may explain the existence or absence of gaps. We identify that gaps
between ethnic groups are either statistically insignificant (p<.01) or small
(2%-6%) if statistically significant, for students living in households with
low income. Increasing gaps however may be observed for higher income. On the
other hand, while higher parental education is associated to higher
performance, it may either increase, decrease or maintain the gaps between
White and Black, and between White and Pardo students. Our results support that
socio-economic variables have major impact on student's performance in both
mathematics and writing examinations irrespectively of ethnic backgrounds,
giving evidence that genetic factors have little or no effect on ethnic group
performance when students are exposed to similar cultural and financial
contexts.

competitive-cooperative (MLCC) framework to facilitate the competition and
cooperation of multiple DEs, which in turns, achieve a significant performance
improvement. Unlike other multi-method strategies which adopt a
multi-population based structure, with individuals only evolving in their
corresponding subpopulations, MLCC implements a parallel structure with the
entire population simultaneously monitored by multiple DEs assigned to their
corresponding layers. An individual can store, utilize and update its evolution
information in different layers based on an individual preference based layer
selecting (IPLS) mechanism and a computational resource allocation bias (RAB)
mechanism. In IPLS, individuals connect to only one favorite layer. While in
RAB, high-quality solutions are evolved by considering all the layers. Thus DEs
associated in the layers work in a competitive and cooperative manner. The
proposed MLCC framework has been implemented on several highly competitive DEs.
Experimental studies show that the MLCC variants significantly outperform the
baseline DEs as well as several state-of-the-art and up-to-date DEs on CEC

habitable zone can lead to abrupt transitions (bifurcations) between a warm and
a snowball (ice-covered) state, bistability between these states, and
hysteresis in planetary climate. This is important for planetary habitability
because snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could
also endanger complex life that already exists. Recent work has shown that
planets tidally locked in synchronous rotation states will transition smoothly
into the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations. Here we
investigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally
influenced, but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar
days. We use PlaSIM, an intermediate-complexity global climate model, with a
thermodynamic mixed layer ocean and the Sun's spectrum. We find that the amount
of hysteresis (range in stellar flux for which there is bistability in climate)
is significantly reduced for solar days with lengths of tens of Earth days, and
disappears for solar days of hundreds of Earth days. These results suggest that
tidally influenced planets orbiting M and K-stars that are not synchronously
rotating could have much less hysteresis associated with the snowball
bifurcations than they would if they were rapidly rotating. This implies that
the amount of time it takes them to escape a snowball state via CO$_2$
outgassing would be greatly reduced, as would the period of cycling between the
warm and snowball state if they have a low CO$_2$ outgassing rate.

relies on quadrature phase-shift keying modulation, pilot-assisted transmission
to estimate the fading channel, and scaled nearest-neighbor decoding at the
receiver. Using our achievability bound, we determine how many pilot symbols
should be transmitted to optimally trade between channel-estimation errors and
rate loss due to pilot overhead. Our analysis also reveals the importance of
using multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or the receiver to provide the
spatial diversity needed to meet the stringent reliability constraint.

observational selection bias. From the joint likelihood of the observed orbital
separations of hot Jupiters discovered in ground-based wide-field transit
surveys, measured with respect to the hyperparameters of the underlying
population model, we recover narrow posterior probability distributions for
$Q_s'$ in two different tidal forcing frequency regimes. We validate the method
using mock samples of transiting planets with known tidal parameters. We find
that $Q_s'$ and its temperature dependence are retrieved reliably over five
orders of magnitude in $Q_s'$. A large sample of hot Jupiters from
small-aperture ground-based surveys yields $\log_{10} Q_s'=(8.26\pm 0.14)$ for
223 systems in the equilibrium-tide regime. We detect no significant dependence
of $Q_s'$ on stellar effective temperature. A further 19 systems in the
dynamical-tide regime yield $\log_{10} Q_s'=7.3\pm 0.4$, indicating stronger
coupling. Detection probabilities for transiting planets at a given orbital
separation scale inversely with the increase in their tidal migration rates
since birth. The resulting bias towards younger systems explains why the
surface gravities of hot Jupiters correlate with their host stars'
chromospheric emission fluxes. We predict departures from a linear
transit-timing ephemeris of less than 4 seconds for WASP-18 over a 20-year
baseline.

structures at the submolecular resolution in close to the native state.
However, due to the high degree of structural complexity and imaging limits,
the automatic segmentation of cellular components from ECT images is very
difficult. To complement and speed up existing segmentation methods, it is
desirable to develop a generic cell component segmentation method that is 1)
not specific to particular types of cellular components, 2) able to segment
unknown cellular components, 3) fully unsupervised and does not rely on the
availability of training data. As an important step towards this goal, in this
paper, we propose a saliency detection method that computes the likelihood that
a subregion in a tomogram stands out from the background. Our method consists
of four steps: supervoxel over-segmentation, feature extraction, feature matrix
decomposition, and computation of saliency. The method produces a distribution
map that represents the regions' saliency in tomograms. Our experiments show
that our method can successfully label most salient regions detected by a human
observer, and able to filter out regions not containing cellular components.
Therefore, our method can remove the majority of the background region, and
significantly speed up the subsequent processing of segmentation and
recognition of cellular components captured by ECT.

used techniques for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional datasets. The
main challenge underlying sPCA is to estimate the first vector of loadings of
the population covariance matrix, provided that only a certain number of
loadings are non-zero. In this paper, we propose confidence intervals for
individual loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the population covariance
matrix. Given an independent sample $X^i \in\mathbb R^p, i = 1,...,n,$
generated from an unknown distribution with an unknown covariance matrix
$\Sigma_0$, our aim is to estimate the first vector of loadings and the largest
eigenvalue of $\Sigma_0$ in a setting where $p\gg n$. Next to the
high-dimensionality, another challenge lies in the inherent non-convexity of
the problem. We base our methodology on a Lasso-penalized M-estimator which,
despite non-convexity, may be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm such as
coordinate or gradient descent. We show that our estimator achieves the minimax
optimal rates in $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-norm. We identify the bias in the
Lasso-based estimator and propose a de-biased sparse PCA estimator for the
vector of loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix
$\Sigma_0$. Our main results provide theoretical guarantees for asymptotic
normality of the de-biased estimator. The major conditions we impose are
sparsity in the first eigenvector of small order $\sqrt{n}/\log p$ and sparsity
of the same order in the columns of the inverse Hessian matrix of the

linearly proportional to the modulation phase delay and the order of generated

independent of modulation phase delay and only depends on the modulation depth

efficiency occurring in the vicinity of resonance, and decreasing away from the
resonant regime. The design approach allows for creating tunable spatially

Specifically, we apply this approach to a time-modulated metasurface in the

progenitor evolution strongly impacts the whole pulsation spectrum exhibited by
ZZ Ceti stars, which are pulsating C/O core white dwarfs located on an narrow

experience different number of thermal pulses. We find that the occurrence or
not of thermal pulses during AGB evolution implies an average deviation in the

of the order of < 5% in the stellar mass. For the mass of the hydrogen
envelope, however, we find deviations up to 2 orders of magnitude in the case

in quantum systems due to its simple interpretation in the semiclassical limit.
In particular, its rate of possible exponential growth at $\hbar \to 0$ is
closely related to the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here we explore how this
approach to quantum chaos relates to the random-matrix theoretical description.
To do so, we introduce and study the level statistics of the logarithm of the
out-of-time-ordered operator, $\hat{\Lambda}(t) = \ln \left( -
\left[\hat{x}(t),\hat{p}_x(0) \right]^2 \right)/(2t)$, that we dub the
""Lyapunovian"" or ""Lyapunov operator"" for brevity. The Lyapunovian's level
statistics is calculated explicitly for the quantum stadium billiard. It is
shown that in the bulk of the filtered spectrum, this statistics perfectly
aligns with the Wigner-Dyson distribution. One of the advantages of looking at
the spectral statistics of this operator is that it has a well-defined
semiclassical limit where it reduces to the matrix of uncorrelated classical
finite-time Lyapunov exponents in a partitioned phase space. We provide a
heuristic picture interpolating these two limits using Moyal quantum mechanics.
Our results show that the Lyapunov operator may serve as a useful tool to
characterize quantum chaos and in particular quantum-to-classical
correspondence in chaotic systems, by connecting the semiclassical Lyapunov
growth at early times, when the quantum effects are weak, to universal level
repulsion that hinges on strong quantum interference effects.

  The approach is based on the work of Mashkin (arXiv:1705.05713), where we

variables is a cyclic system of rank 4, formally the same as the system

both a contextual scenario and a noncontextual scenario of the particle passing

These charges are valid for an arbitrary Higgs sector and only depend on the
branching rules of the $E_6$ fundamental representation and the corresponding
rules for the fermionic representations of their subgroups. By assuming $E_6$
unification, the renormalization group equations~(RGE) allow us to calculate

laser beacons installed on each telescope using a $2 \times 2$ lenslet; c)
higher order aberrations using a $9 \times 9$ Shack-Hartmann. The telescope
pupils are imaged for a visual monitoring while observing. These measurements
enable active field and pupil guiding by actuating a train of tip-tilt mirrors

the possibility of correcting the non-common path errors between the Unit

significantly larger flow gradients are seen than in a previous flux-tube

simulations can show a flow profile with opposing sign in the gradient with
respect to a kinetic electron simulation, implying a reversal in the sign of
the residual stress due to kinetic electrons. The shaping of the intrinsic flow
is strongly determined by the density gradient profile. The sensitivity of the
residual stress to variations in density profile curvature is calculated and
seen to be significantly stronger than to neoclassical flows (Hornsby et al

explain the large variations in the intrinsic flow gradients seen in some AUG
experiments. Analysis of the symmetry breaking properties of the turbulence
shows that profile shearing is the dominant mechanism in producing a finite
parallel wave-number, with turbulence gradient effects contributing a smaller
portion of the parallel wave-vector.

Onsager descriptions for flexible polyatomic systems. The location of the
isotropic-to-nematic phase transition is found to be in good agreement with
molecular simulations for elongated chains up to relatively high polymer
flexibilities, although the predictions of the theory in the nematic regime
lead to gradual underestimations of order parameters with decreasing particle
stiffness. This shortcoming is attributed to increasing overestimations of the
molecular conformational entropy in higher-density phases, which may not be
easily addressed in the formalism of DFT for realistic particle models.
Practical consequences of these limitations are illustrated through the
application of DFT to systems of near-persistence-length DNA duplexes, whose
cholesteric behaviour is found to be strongly contingent on their detailed
accessible conformational space in concentrated solutions.

changes in its orientation over time, and to recurrent formation and
dissolution of single spiral arm ($m=1$ modes) structures. The changing
orientation leads to a flapping-like behavior of the disk and to the formation
of a warped disk structure. The spiral arms may explain the over-densities in

galaxies have $\Psi \gtrsim 60^{\circ}$ and thus exhibit minor-axis (""prolate"")
rotation in which the rotation is preferentially around the photometric major
axis. Kinematic misalignments occur more frequently for lower galaxy spin or
denser galaxy environments. Using the observed misalignment and ellipticity
distributions, we infer the intrinsic shape distribution of our sample and find
that MASSIVE slow rotators are consistent with being mildly triaxial, with mean
axis ratios of $b/a=0.88$ and $c/a=0.65$. In terms of local kinematic features,
51% of the sample exhibit kinematic twists of larger than $20^{\circ}$, and 2
galaxies have kinematically distinct components. The frequency of misalignment
and the broad distribution of $\Psi$ reported here suggest that the most
massive early-type galaxies are mildly triaxial, and that formation processes
resulting in kinematically misaligned slow rotators such as gas-poor mergers
occur frequently in this mass range.

this direction by constructing an effective free energy for continuous
dynamical quantum phase transitions appearing after quantum quenches in the

conditions. The absorber, with $ N(HI) \sim 10^{17.0}$ ~\sqcm\ and absorption
lines spread over $\gtrsim$1000~\kms\ in velocity, is one of the strongest
known OVI absorbers at $\log N(OVI)=$15.54$\pm$0.17. Our analysis makes use of
the previously known low-(e.g. \MgII), intermediate-(e.g. SiIV), and
high-ionization (e.g., CIV, NV, NeVIII) metal lines along with new $HST/$COS
observations that cover OVI, and an $HST/$ACS image of the quasar field.
Consistent with previous studies, we find that the absorber has a multiphase
structure. The low-ionization phase arises from gas with a density of $\log
(n_{\rm H}/\rm cm^{-3})\sim-2.5$ and a solar to super-solar metallicity. The
high-ionization phase stems from gas with a significantly lower density, i.e.
$\log (n_{\rm H}/\rm cm^{-3}) \sim-3.8$, and a near-solar to solar metallicity.
The high-ionization phase accounts for all of the absorption seen in CIV, NV,
and OVI. We find the the detected \NeVIII, reported by \cite{Tripp2011}, is
best explained as originating in a stand-alone collisionally ionized phase at
$T\sim10^{5.85}~\rm K$, except in one component in which both OVI and NeVIII
can be produced via photoionization. We demonstrate that such strong OVI
absorption can easily arise from photoionization at $z\gtrsim1$, but that, due
to the decreasing extragalactic UV background radiation, only collisional
ionization can produce large OVI features at $z\sim0$. The azimuthal angle of
$\sim88$\degree\ of the disk of the nearest ($\rm 68~kpc$) luminous ($1.3L_*$)

permutation invariance, a coupling geometry is computed to approximate the
minimum energy macrostate of a network's system. Such a macrostate is supposed
to constitute the intrinsic structures of the system, so that the coupling
geometry should be taken as information contents, or even the nonparametric
minimum sufficient statistics of the network data. Then pertinent null and
alternative hypotheses, such as nestedness, are to be formulated according to
the macrostate. That is, any efficient testing statistic needs to be a function
of this coupling geometry. These conceptual architectures and mechanisms are by
and large still missing in community ecology literature, and rendered
misconceptions prevalent in this research area. Here the algorithmically
computed coupling geometry is shown consisting of deterministic multiscale
block patterns, which are framed by two marginal ultrametric trees on row and
column axes, and stochastic uniform randomness within each block found on the
finest scale. Functionally a series of increasingly larger ensembles of matrix
mimicries is derived by conforming to the multiscale block configurations. Here
matrix mimicking is meant to be subject to constraints of row and column sums
sequences. Based on such a series of ensembles, a profile of distributions
becomes a natural device for checking the validity of testing statistics or
structural indexes. An energy based index is used for testing whether network
data indeed contains structural geometry. A new version block-based nestedness
index is also proposed. Its validity is checked and compared with the existing
ones. A computing paradigm, called Data Mechanics, and its application on one
real data network are illustrated throughout the developments and discussions
in this paper.

onset of the breathing distortion and the associated condensation of holes onto
$a_{1g}$-symmetric molecular orbitals formed by the O-$2p_{\sigma}$ orbitals on
collapsed octahedra. We also derive a single band model involving the hopping

understanding of urban spaces have been a controversial argument largely
discussed in the literature. Shopping malls offer an open, safe and democratic
version of the public space. Many of their detractors suggest that malls target
their customers in subtle ways, promoting social exclusion. In this work, we
analyze whether malls offer opportunities for social mixing by analyzing the
patterns of shopping mall visits in a large Latin-American city: Santiago de
Chile.
  We use a large XDR (Data Detail Records) dataset from a telecommunication
company to analyze the mobility of $387,152$ cell phones around $16$ large
malls in Santiago de Chile during one month. We model the influx of people to
malls in terms of a gravity model of mobility, and we are able to predict the
customer profile distribution of each mall, explaining it in terms of mall
location, the population distribution, and mall size.
  Then, we analyze the concept of social attraction, expressed as people from
low and middle classes being attracted by malls that target high-income
customers. We include a social attraction factor in our model and find that it
is negligible in the process of choosing a mall. We observe that social mixing
arises only in peripheral malls located farthest from the city center, which
both low and middle class people visit. Using a co-visitation model we show
that people tend to choose a restricted profile of malls according to their
socio-economic status and their distance from the mall. We conclude that the
potential for social mixing in malls could be capitalized by designing public
policies regarding transportation and mobility.

`knee' mass $\log (M_{*}\,h^{2}_{70}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) = 9.94 \pm 0.01 \pm
0.05$, a low-mass slope parameter $\alpha = -1.25 \pm 0.02 \pm 0.1$, and a

uncertainties indicates that the `knee' mass is a cosmologically fair
measurement of the $z = 0$ value, with its largest uncertainty originating from
the absolute flux calibration, but that the low-mass slope is only
representative of the local Universe. We also explore large scale trends in
$\alpha$ and $M_{*}$ across the ALFALFA volume. Unlike with the 40 per cent
sample, there is now sufficient coverage in both of the survey fields to make
an independent determination of the HIMF in each. We find a large discrepancy
in the low-mass slope ($\Delta \alpha = 0.14 \pm 0.03$) between the two
regions, and argue that this is likely caused by the presence of a deep void in
one field and the Virgo cluster in the other. Furthermore, we find that the
value of the `knee' mass within the Local Volume appears to be suppressed by
$0.18 \pm 0.04$ dex compared to the global ALFALFA value, which explains the
lower value measured by the shallower HIPASS. We discuss possible explanations

classical and quantum settings. In general it may not be possible to
distinguish classical from quantum transport through monitoring the mean
current, as both ballistic as well as diffusive regimes occur in either
setting. Here we show that genuine quantum features become manifest in large
fluctuations which allow a discrimination between classical and quantum
transport: in the classical case, realizations that are characterized by
atypically large boundary activity are associated with larger than typical
currents, i.e. an enhanced number of events at the boundaries goes together
with a large current. Conversely, in the quantum case the Zeno effect leads to
the suppression of current in trajectories with large activity at the boundary.
We analyze how these different dynamical regimes are reflected in the structure
of rare fluctuations. We show furthermore that realizations supporting a large
current are generated via weak long-range correlations within the spin chain,
typically associated with hyperuniformity.

following from this picture. In the intermediate region between the regime of
good conduction and that of insulation, one typically finds a change of sign of
the temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), even at elevated temperature
spanning ambient conditions, a phenomenology that was first identified by Mooij
in 1973. Traditional weak coupling approaches to identify relevant corrections
to the Boltzmann picture focused on long distance interference effects such as
""weak localization"", which are especially important in low dimensions (1D, 2D)
and close to the zero temperature limit. Here we formulate a strong-coupling
approach to tackle the interplay of strong disorder and lattice deformations
(phonons) in bulk three-dimensional metals at high temperatures. We identify a
polaronic mechanism of strong disorder renormalization, which describes how a
lattice locally responds to the relevant impurity potential. This mechanism,
which quantitatively captures the Mooij regime, is physically distinct and
unrelated to Anderson localization, but realizes early seminal ideas of
Anderson himself, concerning the interplay of disorder and lattice

medium-resolution spectra (190 km s$^{-1}$ FWHM at H$\beta$) of a sample of 28

decomposition to the H$\beta$ and [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission

outlier galaxy is found, in which the center of the core component of [OIII] is

subgiant branch (SGB), and red giant branch (RGB), in each case at two
different effective temperatures and two metallicities, [M/H]=0.0 and -2.0.

magnitudes and colour indices in the broad-band Johnson-Cousins $UBVRI$ and
2MASS $JHK_{\rm s}$, and the medium-band Str\""{o}mgren $uvby$ photometric
systems. The 3D-1D differences in photometric magnitudes and colour indices are
small in both photometric systems and typically do not exceed $\pm0.03$ mag.
Only in the case of the coolest giants located on the upper RGB are the
differences in the $U$ and $u$ bands able reach $\approx-0.2$ mag at [M/H]=0.0
and $\approx-0.1$ mag at [M/H]=-2.0. Generally, the 3D-1D differences are
largest in the blue-UV part of the spectrum and decrease towards longer
wavelengths. They are also sensitive to the effective temperature and are
significantly smaller in hotter stars. Metallicity also plays a role and leads
to slightly larger 3D-1D differences at [M/H]=0.0. All these patterns are
caused by a complex interplay between the radiation field, opacities, and
horizontal temperature fluctuations that occur due to convective motions in
stellar atmospheres. Although small, the 3D-1D differences in the magnitudes
and colour indices are nevertheless comparable to or larger than typical
photometric uncertainties and may therefore cause non-negligible systematic

first one is a scattering broadening of the hole density of states, which
reduces significantly the amplitude of the alternating carrier-induced

so-far disregarded single-ion magnetic anisotropy and disorder-driven
non-uniformities of the carrier density, both favoring the $\langle 100\rangle$

heterogeneous agents interact according to a graphon. After studying properties
of equilibria in graphon games, we show that graphon equilibria can approximate
equilibria of large network games sampled from the graphon. We next show that,
under some regularity assumptions, the graphon approach enables the design of
asymptotically optimal interventions via the solution of an optimization
problem with much lower dimension than the one based on the entire network

and show that the graphon intervention can be computed efficiently and based
solely on aggregated relational data.

unbounded genus, but can have genus as high as $O(n)$. Our method applies as

obtain NC algorithms for the following problems in any family of graphs (or
networks) with a one-crossing forbidden minor:
  $\bullet$ Determining whether a given graph has a perfect matching and if so,
finding one.
  $\bullet$ Finding a minimum weight perfect matching in the graph, assuming
that the edge weights are polynomially bounded.

be negative in a restricted (strong-field) region of space and positive outside
it (""trapped ghost"") thus explaining why no ghosts are observed under usual
conditions. Another possible explanation of the same may be a rapid decay of a
ghost field at large radii. Before discussing particular examples, some general
results are presented, such as the necessity of anisotropic matter for
obtaining asymptotically flat or anti-de Sitter wormholes, no-hair and global
structure theorems for black holes with scalar fields. The stability properties

Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Although black holes with these masses cannot
be formed as a result of stellar evolution, they may have formed in the early
Universe and are therefore called Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Previous
searches for PBHs have focused on either short timescale bursts or the
contribution of PBHs to the isotropic gamma-ray emission. We show that, in case
of individual PBHs, the Fermi LAT is most sensitive to PBHs with temperatures
above approximately 16 GeV and masses $6\times 10^{11}$ g, which it can detect
out to a distance of about 0.03 pc. These PBHs have a remaining lifetime of
months to years at the start of the Fermi mission. They would appear as
potentially moving point sources with gamma-ray emission that becomes
spectrally harder and brighter with time until the PBH completely evaporates.
In this paper, we develop a new algorithm to detect the proper motion of a
gamma-ray point sources, and apply it to 318 unassociated point sources at high
galactic latitude in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL). None of
unassociated point sources with spectra consistent with PBH evaporation show
significant proper motion. Using the non-detection of PBH candidates, we derive
a 99\% confidence limit on PBH evaporation rate in the vicinity of the Earth
$\dot{\rho}_{\rm PBH} < 7.2 \times 10^3\: {\rm {pc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}}$. This
limit is similar to the limits obtained with ground-based gamma-ray
observatories.

  temperatures",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Upon the excitation by an ultrashort laser pulse the conditions in a material
can drastically change, altering its optical properties and therefore the
relative amount of absorbed energy, a quan- tity relevant for determining the
damage threshold and for developing a detailed simulation of a structuring
process. The subject of interest in this work is the d-band metal gold which
has an absorption edge marking the transition of free valence electrons and an
absorbing deep d-band with bound electrons. Reflectivity changes are observed
in experiment over a broad spectral range at ablation conditions. To understand
the involved processes the laser excitation is modeled by a com- bination of
first principle calculations with a two-temperature model. The description is
kept most general and applied to realistically simulate the transfer of the
absorbed energy of a Gaussian laser pulse into the electronic system at every
point in space at every instance of time. An electronic temperature-dependent
reflectivity map is calculated, describing the out of equilibrium reflectivity
during laser excitation for photon energies from 0.9 - 6.4 eV, including inter-
and intra-band transi- tions and a temperature-dependent damping factor. The
main mechanisms are identified explaining the electronic temperature-dependent
change in reflectivity: broadening of the edge of the occu- pied/unoccupied
states around the chemical potential $\mu$, also leading to a shift of the
$\mu$ and an increase of the collision rate of free s/p-band electrons with
bound d-band holes.

account for symmetric relations, we generalize this to a new type of networks
modeled on d-cliqued tree graphs, which are obtained by adding edges to regular
d-trees to form d-cliques. This setting gives a more realistic model for
epidemic outbreaks originating, for example, within a family or classroom and
which could reach a population by transmission via children in schools.
Specifically, we quantify how an infection starting in a clique (e.g. family)
can reach other cliques through the body of the graph (e.g. public places).
Moreover, we propose and study the notion of a safe zone, a subset that has a
negligible probability of infection.

with failure causing disease or death. Recent work has found that cooperation
between feedback and buffering---the use of reservoirs of molecules to maintain
molecular concentrations---is often critical for biochemical regulation, and
that buffering can act as a derivative or lead controller. However, buffering
differs from derivative feedback in important ways: it is not typically limited
by stability constraints on the parallel feedback loop, for some signals it
acts instead as a low-pass filter, and it can change the location of
disturbances in the closed-loop system. Here, we propose a frequency-domain
framework for studying the regulatory properties of buffer-feedback systems. We
determine standard single-output closed-loop transfer functions and discuss
loop-shaping properties. We also derive novel fundamental limits for
buffer-feedback regulation, which show that buffering and removal processes can
reduce the fundamental limits on feedback regulation. We apply the framework to
study the regulation for glycolysis (anaerobic metabolism) with creatine
phosphate buffering.

skill complementarity among other productive factors shaping the economies of
cities. This paper tackles segregation during working hours from a dynamical
perspective by focusing on the movement of urbanites across the city. In
contrast to measuring residential patterns of segregation, we used mobile phone
data to infer home-work trajectory net- works and apply a community detection
algorithm to the example city of Santiago, Chile. We then describe
qualitatively and quantitatively outlined communities, in terms of their socio
eco- nomic composition. We then evaluate segregation for each of these
communities as the probability that a person from a specific community will
interact with a co-worker from the same commu- nity. Finally, we compare these
results with simulations where a new work location is set for each real user,
following the empirical probability distributions of home-work distances and
angles of direction for each community. Methodologically, this study shows that
segregation during working hours for Santiago is unexpectedly high for most of
the city with the exception of its central and business district. In fact, the
only community that is not statistically segregated corresponds to the downtown
area of Santiago, described as a zone of encounter and integration across the

been of interest since the advent of microfabrication. In this report, theory
which is common to any periodic cell (or any cell that can be extended

diffusion equation in this cell was solved and the concentration profile was
obtained in terms of its Fourier coefficients and as a function of an arbitrary
current density. From this base result, a set of properties were derived which
are fairly general, since they don't assume restrictions such as reversible
electrode reactions (Nernst equation valid when current circulates). These
properties involve: horizontal averages and (weighted) sum of concentrations,
both with a close connection to the net current and accumulation of species in
the cell. The derived properties allow: to explain qualitative aspects of
collection efficiency and limiting currents, to predict the concentration on
counter electrodes and non-linearities caused by depletion of species at
extremely polarized electrodes, and to estimate the time required by the

is made by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). We propose to
learn a decision tree, which clarifies the specific reason for each prediction
made by the CNN at the semantic level. I.e., the decision tree decomposes
feature representations in high conv-layers of the CNN into elementary concepts
of object parts. In this way, the decision tree tells people which object parts
activate which filters for the prediction and how much they contribute to the
prediction score. Such semantic and quantitative explanations for CNN
predictions have specific values beyond the traditional pixel-level analysis of
CNNs. More specifically, our method mines all potential decision modes of the
CNN, where each mode represents a common case of how the CNN uses object parts
for prediction. The decision tree organizes all potential decision modes in a
coarse-to-fine manner to explain CNN predictions at different fine-grained
levels. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

possibility of designing a controller that ensures stability, while tracking a
given target velocity profile that changes as a function of location. An ideal

networks can provide more powerful mapping capability than the traditional
feedforward neural networks (Sigma-Sigma neural networks). In the existing
literature, in order to reduce the number of the Pi nodes in the Pi layer, a
special multinomial P_s is used in SPSNNs. Each monomial in P_s is linear with
respect to each particular variable sigma_i when the other variables are taken
as constants. Therefore, the monomials like sigma_i^n or sigma_i^n sigma_j with
n>1 are not included. This choice may be somehow intuitive, but is not
necessarily the best. We propose in this paper a modified Sigma-Pi-Sigma neural
network (MSPSNN) with an adaptive approach to find a better multinomial for a
given problem. To elaborate, we start from a complete multinomial with a given
order. Then we employ a regularization technique in the learning process for
the given problem to reduce the number of monomials used in the multinomial,
and end up with a new SPSNN involving the same number of monomials (= the
number of nodes in the Pi-layer) as in P_s. Numerical experiments on some
benchmark problems show that our MSPSNN behaves better than the traditional
SPSNN with P_s.

efficiency of deep learning, making it possible to deploy solutions in

that a smaller-norm parameter or feature plays a less informative role at the
inference time. In this paper, we propose a channel pruning technique for
accelerating the computations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
does not critically rely on this assumption. Instead, it focuses on direct
simplification of the channel-to-channel computation graph of a CNN without the
need of performing a computationally difficult and not-always-useful task of
making high-dimensional tensors of CNN structured sparse. Our approach takes
two stages: first to adopt an end-to- end stochastic training method that
eventually forces the outputs of some channels to be constant, and then to
prune those constant channels from the original neural network by adjusting the
biases of their impacting layers such that the resulting compact model can be
quickly fine-tuned. Our approach is mathematically appealing from an
optimization perspective and easy to reproduce. We experimented our approach
through several image learning benchmarks and demonstrate its interesting
aspects and competitive performance.

Additionally, in Cr$_2$CoAl, changing the volume by $\pm$ 5% or the ratio of

distributedly stored, and propose a novel distributed Newton method for
training deep neural networks. By variable and feature-wise data partitions,
and some careful designs, we are able to explicitly use the Jacobian matrix for
matrix-vector products in the Newton method. Some techniques are incorporated
to reduce the running time as well as the memory consumption. First, to reduce
the communication cost, we propose a diagonalization method such that an
approximate Newton direction can be obtained without communication between
machines. Second, we consider subsampled Gauss-Newton matrices for reducing the
running time as well as the communication cost. Third, to reduce the
synchronization cost, we terminate the process of finding an approximate Newton
direction even though some nodes have not finished their tasks. Details of some
implementation issues in distributed environments are thoroughly investigated.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the
distributed training of deep neural networks. In compared with stochastic
gradient methods, it is more robust and may give better test accuracy.

originates from Rashba spin orbit coupling due to structure inversion asymmetry

Centauri, Trappist-1 and many other nearby M-type stars has led to
speculations, whether liquid water and life actually exist on these planets. To
a large extent, the answer depends on their yet unknown atmospheres, which may
though be within observational reach in the near future by JWST, ELT and other
planned telescopes. We consider the habitability of planets of M-type stars in
the context of their atmospheric properties, heat transport and irradiation.
Instead of the traditional definition of the habitable zone, we define the
bio-habitable zone, where liquid water and complex organic molecules can
survive on at least part of the planetary surface. The atmospheric impact on
the temperature is quantified in terms of the heating factor (a combination of
greenhouse heating, stellar irradiation, albedo etc.) and heat redistribution
(horizontal energy transport). We investigate the bio-habitable domain (where
planets can support surface liquid water and organics) in terms of these two
factors. Our results suggest that planets orbiting M-type stars may have
life-supporting temperatures, at least on part of their surface, for a wide
range of atmospheric properties. We apply this analyses to Proxima b and the
Trappist-1 system. Finally we discuss the implications to the search of
biosignatures and demonstrate how they may be used to estimate the abundance of
photosynthesis and biotic planets.

applications. However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models

concurrent requests, the latency during inference can also be very critical for
costly computing resources. In this work, we address these problems by
quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary
codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under
the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the
binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating
minimization is then applied. We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs,
i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on the
language models. Compared with the full-precision counter part, by 2-bit
quantization we can achieve ~16x memory saving and ~6x real inference
acceleration on CPUs, with only a reasonable loss in the accuracy. By 3-bit
quantization, we can achieve almost no loss in the accuracy or even surpass the
original model, with ~10.5x memory saving and ~3x real inference acceleration.
Both results beat the exiting quantization works with large margins. We extend
our alternating quantization to image classification tasks. In both RNNs and
feedforward neural networks, the method also achieves excellent performance.

scale. We consider attacks by botnets on cyber-physical systems (CPS), which
require advanced capabilities such as controlling the physical processes in
real-time. Traditional botnets are not suitable for this goal mainly because
they lack process control capabilities, are not optimized for low latency
communication, and bots generally do not leverage local resources. We argue
that such attacks would require cyber-physical botnets. A cyber-physical botnet
needs coordinated and heterogeneous bots, capable of performing adversarial
control strategies while subject to the constraints of the target CPS. In this
work, we present CPSBot, a framework to build cyber-physical botnets. We
present an example of a centralized CPSBot targeting a centrally controlled
system and a decentralized CPSBot targeting a system distributed control. We
implemented the former CPSBot using MQTT for the C&C channel and Modbus/TCP as
the target network protocol and we used it to launch several attacks on real

in the missing values. In this paper, we present several variants of combining
single and multiple imputation with bootstrapping to create ensembles that can
model uncertainty and diversity in the data, and that are robust to high
missingness in the data. We present three ensemble strategies: bootstrapping on
incomplete data followed by (i) single imputation and (ii) multiple imputation,
and (iii) multiple imputation ensemble without bootstrapping. We perform an
extensive evaluation of the performance of the these ensemble strategies on 8
datasets by varying the missingness ratio. Our results show that bootstrapping
followed by multiple imputation using expectation maximization is the most
robust method even at high missingness ratio (up to 30%). For small missingness
ratio (up to 10%) most of the ensemble methods perform quivalently but better
than single imputation. Kappa-error plots suggest that accurate classifiers
with reasonable diversity is the reason for this behaviour. A consistent
observation in all the datasets suggests that for small missingness (up to
10%), bootstrapping on incomplete data without any imputation produces
equivalent results to other ensemble methods.

and $B^0_s\to\pi^+\pi^-$ decays. Some of these modes are highly suppressed and
are among the rarest $B$ decays. Direct CP asymmetries on various modes are
constantly updated. It is well known that direct CP asymmetries and rates of
suppressed modes are sensitive to final state interaction (FSI). As new
measurements are reported and more data will be collected, it is interesting
and timely to revisit the rescattering effects in $B_{u,d,s}\to PP$ states. We
perform a $\chi^2$ analysis with all available data on CP-averaged rates and CP
asymmetries in $\overline B{}_{u,d,s}\to PP$ decays. Our numerical results are
compared to data and those from factorization approach. The quality of the fit
is improved significantly from the factorization results in the presence of
rescattering. The relations on topological amplitudes and rescattering are
explored and they help to provide a better understanding of the effects of FSI.
As suggested by U(3) symmetry on topological amplitudes and FSI, a vanishing
exchange rescattering scenario is considered. The exchange, annihilation,
$u$-penguin, $u$-penguin annihilation and some electroweak penguin amplitudes
are enhanced significantly via annihilation and total annihilation
rescatterings. In particular, the $u$-penguin annihilation amplitude is sizably
enhanced by the tree amplitude via total annihilation rescattering. These
enhancements affect rates and CP asymmetries. Predictions can be checked in the
near future.

discrimination in a composite system consisting of $N$ subsystems, where each
subsystem is shared between two parties and the state of each subsystem is
randomly sampled from a particular ensemble comprising the Bell states. We show
that the success probability of perfectly identifying the state converges to
$1$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$ if the entropy of the probability distribution
associated with the ensemble is less than $1$, even if the success probability
is less than $1$ for any finite $N$. In other words, the nonlocality of the
$N$-fold ensemble asymptotically disappears if the probability distribution
associated with each ensemble is concentrated. Furthermore, we show that the
disappearance of the nonlocality can be regarded as a remarkable counterexample
of a fundamental open question in theoretical computer science, called a
parallel repetition conjecture of interactive games with two classically
communicating players. Measurements for the discrimination task include a
projective measurement of one party represented by stabilizer states, which

$-$EW$_{\mathrm{HeII}} \lesssim 9$ {\AA}, respectively. This is much lower than
seen for typical X-ray binaries at a similar X-ray luminosity (which, for
$L_{\mathrm{2-10 keV}} \approx 10^{33}-10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is typically
$-$EW$_{\mathrm{H\alpha}} \sim 50$ {\AA}). This supports our previous
suggestion (by Bahramian et al.) of an H-poor donor in X9. We perform timing
analysis on archival far-ultraviolet, $V$ and $I$-band data to search for
periodicities. In the optical bands we recover the seven-day superorbital
period initially discovered in X-rays, but we do not recover the orbital
period. In the far-ultraviolet we find evidence for a 27.2 min period (shorter
than the 28.2 min period seen in X-rays). We find that either a neutron star or
black hole could explain the observed properties of X9. We also perform binary
evolution calculations, showing that the formation of an initial black hole /
He-star binary early in the life of a globular cluster could evolve into a
present-day system such as X9 (should the compact object in this system indeed
be a black hole) via mass-transfer driven by gravitational wave radiation.

networks is affected by the conflict between forwarding nodes. It has been
shown that sending more packets than maximum achievable end-to-end throughput
not only fails to increase throughput, but also decreases throughput owing to
high contention and collision. Accordingly, it is of crucial importance for a
source node to know the maximum end-to-end throughput. The end-to-end
throughput depends on multiple factors, such as physical layer limitations, MAC
protocol properties, routing policy and nodes distribution. There have been
many studies on analytical modeling of end-to-end throughput but none of them
has taken routing policy and nodes distribution as well as MAC layer altogether
into account. In this paper, the end-to-end throughput with perfect MAC layer
is obtained based on routing policy and nodes distribution in one and two
dimensional networks. Then, imperfections of IEEE 802:11 protocol is added to
the model to obtain precise value. An exhaustive simulation is also made to
validate the proposed models using NS2 simulator. Results show that if the
distribution to the next hop for a particular routing policy is known, our
methodology can obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput precisely.

Raman scattering broad wings, assuming that the hydrogen Ly$\beta$ and
Ly$\gamma$ lines emitted within the radiation-bounded HII zone around a white
dwarf have the same double Gaussian line profile shape as the hydrogen Balmer
lines. The simulation shows that the scattering HI zones are attached to (or
located just outside of) the inner HII shells. The best fit to the observed
broad HI line profiles indicates that the column density of the scattering
neutral zone is $N_{\rm H} \simeq $ 3 -- 5 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. We
examined whether the geometrical structure responsible for the observed
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles is a bipolar conical shell structure,
consisting of the radiation-bounded ionized zone and the outer material bounded
neutral zone. The expanding bipolar structure might be two opposite regions of
the common envelope or the outer shell of the Roche lobe around the hot white
dwarf, formed through the mass inflows from the giant star and pushed out by
the fast winds from the hot white dwarf.

between discrete states of a coherently driven quantum system it is often
inconvenient to measure the population of the target state. Instead, after the
interaction that transfers the population from the initial state to the target
state, a second interaction is applied which brings the system back to the
initial state, the population of which is easy to measure and normalize. If the
transition probability is $p$ in the forward process, then classical intuition
suggests that the probability to return to the initial state after the backward
process should be $p^2$. However, this classical expectation is generally
misleading because it neglects interference effects. This paper presents a
rigorous theoretical analysis based on the SU(2) and SU(3) symmetries of the
propagators describing the evolution of quantum systems with two and three
states, resulting in explicit analytic formulas that link the two-step
probabilities to the single-step ones. Explicit examples are given with the
popular techniques of rapid adiabatic passage and stimulated Raman adiabatic
passage. The present results suggest that quantum-mechanical probabilities
degrade faster in repeated processes than classical probabilities. Therefore,
the actual single-pass efficiencies in various experiments, calculated from
double-pass probabilities, might have been greater than the reported values.

security and the end-to-end delay management, which requires a meticulous
cross-layer design, has seldom been evaluated. In this work, by combining the
tools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we analyze the tradeoff
between the delay and the security performance in large wireless networks. We
further propose a simple transmission mechanism which splits a message into two
packets and evaluate its effect on the mean delay and the secrecy outage
probability. Our numerical results reveal that the security performance is
better for larger path loss exponent when the density of legitimate nodes is
large, and it is reverse when the density is small. Moreover, it is observed
that by introducing the simple mechanism of message split, the security
performance is greatly improved in the backlogged scenario and slightly
improved in the dynamic scenario when the density of legitimate transmitters is
large. In summary, this work provides an understanding and a rule-of-thumb for
the practical design of wireless networks where both the delay and the security

frequency, thus exploiting the natural selective filtering of such structures.
Described is an optimized dual-term nonlinear stiffness resonator that enhances
the input signal level and the sensitivity to changes in both amplitude and
phase, while limiting the obtained response to desired levels. This amplifier
is geared to cases when the frequency of the input is known or measurable, like

regarding the magnetospheric conditions in these stars - even after 50 years of
research! Indeed, 2017 marks the golden anniversary of the discovery of the
first radio pulsar, and theorists and observers alike are looking forward to
another half-century of discovery, with many new experiments coming online in
the next decades. In this review paper, we will briefly summarise recent HE
pulsar observations, mention some theoretical models that provide a basic
framework within which to make sense of the varied measurements, and finally
review some of the latest theoretical developments in pulsar emission
modelling.

investigated theoretically in a spin-valve device based on a single magnetic
molecule. We consider a device consisting of two ferromagnetic electrodes
bridged by a carbon nanotube, acting as a quantum dot, to which a
spin-anisotropic molecule is exchange coupled. Such a coupling allows for
transfer of angular momentum between the molecule and a spin current flowing
through the dot, and thus, for switching orientation of the molecular spin. We
demonstrate that this current-induced switching process exhibits a hysteretic
behavior with respect to a bias voltage applied to the device. The analysis is
carried out with the use of the real-time diagrammatic technique in the
lowest-order expansion of the tunnel coupling of the dot to electrodes. The
influence of both the intrinsic properties of the spin-valve device (the spin
polarization of electrodes and the coupling strength of the molecule to the
dot) and those of the molecule itself (magnetic anisotropy and spin relaxation)
on the size of the magnetic hysteresis loop is discussed.

output for negative inputs such that the output mean of the units is close to
zero, hence reducing the bias shift effect. Thirdly, there is a saturation on
the negative part of PoLU, which makes it more noise-robust for negative
inputs. Furthermore, we prove that PoLU is able to map more portions of every
layer's input to the same space by using the power function and thus increases
the number of response regions of the neural network. We use image
classification for comparing our proposed activation function with others. In
the experiments, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Street View House Numbers (SVHN)

have discovered about 175 very-high-energy (VHE; $E >$ 100 GeV) gamma-ray

Nearly 40 of these are confirmed pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). We present results
from a leptonic emission code that models the spectral energy density of a PWN
by solving a Fokker-Planck-type transport equation and calculating inverse
Compton and synchrotron emissivities. Although models such as these have been
developed before, most of them model the geometry of a PWN as that of a single
sphere. We have created a time-dependent, multi-zone model to investigate
changes in the particle spectrum as the particles traverse through the PWN, by
considering a time and spatially-dependent magnetic field, spatially-dependent
bulk particle motion causing convection, diffusion, and energy losses (SR, IC
and adiabatic). Our code predicts the radiation spectrum at different positions
in the nebula, yielding novel results, e.g., the surface brightness versus the
radius and the PWN size as function of energy. We calibrated our new model
against more basic models using the observed spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1,
incorporating data from H.E.S.S. as well as radio and X-ray experiments. We fit
our predicted radiation spectra to data from G21.5$-$0.9, G54.1+0.3, and HESS

brightness as a function of spin-down of the pulsar.

of the Berry phase and its behavior depend on how precisely it is defined. In
particular, identifying the Berry phase as a polarization, its change
represents a polarization current which also depends on the definition. We
demonstrate this by elucidating mutual relations among different definitions of

total charge transported during a Thouless pumping process is independent of

structure in terms of the nova shell morphology and estimate the emission
distribution directly following the light-curve's dust-dip.
  High-cadence optical polarimetry and spectroscopy observations of a nova are
presented. The ejecta is modelled in terms of morpho-kinematics and
photoionisation structure.
  Initially observational results are presented, including broadband
polarimetry and spectroscopy of V5668 Sgr nova during eruption. Variability
over these observations provides clues towards the evolving structure of the
nova shell. The position angle of the shell is derived from polarimetry, which
is attributed to scattering from small dust grains. Shocks in the nova outflow
are suggested in the photometry and the effect of these on the nova shell are
illustrated with various physical diagnostics. Changes in density and
temperature as the super soft source phase of the nova began are discussed. Gas
densities are found to be of the order of 10$^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the nova in
its auroral phase. The blackbody temperature of the central stellar system is
estimated to be around $2.2\times10^{5}$ K at times coincident with the super
soft source turn-on. It was found that the blend around 4640 $\rm{\AA}$
commonly called `nitrogen flaring' is more naturally explained as flaring of
the O~{\sc ii} multiplet (V1) from 4638 - 4696 $\rm{\AA}$, i.e. `oxygen
flaring'.

  Firstly we derive the strength of evidence for nonparametric priors. It turns
out that we get the by now more or less accepted strength of evidence as the
ratio of two suprema,
$\sup_{\theta\geq\theta_0}f(x|\theta)/\sup_{\theta<\theta_0}f(x|\theta)$. Here
the hypotheses of the prosecutor and defence are given by $H_p: \theta\geq

cooling sequence of the Galactic bulge. Although the degenerate sequence can be
well fitted employing the most up-to-date theoretical cooling sequences,
observations show a systematic excess of red objects that cannot be explained
by the theoretical models of single carbon-oxygen white dwarfs of the
appropriate masses. Here we present a population synthesis study of the white
dwarf cooling sequence of the Galactic bulge that takes into account the
populations of both single white dwarfs and binary systems containing at least
one white dwarf. These calculations incorporate state-of-the-art cooling
sequences for white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-deficient
atmospheres, for both white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen and helium cores, and
also take into account detailed prescriptions of the evolutionary history of
binary systems. Our Monte Carlo simulator also incorporates all the known
observational biases. This allows us to model with a high degree of realism the
white dwarf population of the Galactic bulge. We find that the observed excess
of red stars can be partially attributed to white dwarf plus main sequence
binaries, and to cataclysmic variables or dwarf novae. Our best fit is obtained
with a higher binary fraction and an initial mass function slope steeper than
standard values, as well as with the inclusion of differential reddening and
blending. Our results also show that the possible contribution of double
degenerate systems or young and thick-disk bulge stars is negligible.

maintaining the integrity of these cloud-storage databases by converting the

$A\subseteq {B_m}$ outputs a decision tree for $A$ of minimum depth. This
problem has many applications that include, to name a few, computer vision,
group testing, exact learning from membership queries and game theory.
  Arkin et al. and Moshkov gave a polynomial time $(\ln |A|)$- approximation
algorithm (for the depth). The result of Dinur and Steurer for set cover
implies that this problem cannot be approximated with ratio $(1-o(1))\cdot \ln
|A|$, unless P=NP. Moskov the combinatorial measure of extended teaching
dimension of $A$, $ETD(A)$. He showed that $ETD(A)$ is a lower bound for the
depth of the decision tree for $A$ and then gave an {\it exponential time}
$ETD(A)/\log(ETD(A))$-approximation algorithm.
  In this paper we further study the $ETD(A)$ measure and a new combinatorial
measure, $DEN(A)$, that we call the density of the set $A$. We show that
$DEN(A)\le ETD(A)+1$. We then give two results. The first result is that the
lower bound $ETD(A)$ of Moshkov for the depth of the decision tree for $A$ is
greater than the bounds that are obtained by the classical technique used in
the literature. The second result is a polynomial time $(\ln 2)
DEN(A)$-approximation (and therefore $(\ln 2) ETD(A)$-approximation) algorithm
for the depth of the decision tree of $A$. We also show that a better
approximation ratio implies P=NP.
  We then apply the above results to learning the class of disjunctions of
predicates from membership queries. We show that the $ETD$ of this class is
bounded from above by the degree $d$ of its Hasse diagram. We then show that

considered a good system for realizing exciton Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC). The fact that their BEC has not been attained so far is attributed to a
collision-induced loss, whose nature remains unclear. To understand collisional
properties of cold paraexcitons governing their BEC, we perform here a
microscopic consideration of the s-wave paraexciton-paraexciton scattering. We
show its two-channel character with incoming paraexcitons coupled to a
biexciton, which is a Feshbach resonance producing a paraexciton loss and a
diminution of their background scattering length. The former elucidates the
mechanism of the long-observed paraexciton loss, which turns out to be
inefficient at temperatures near one Kelvin and below, whereas the latter makes
the paraexciton scattering length in strain-induced traps negative under stress
exceeding a critical value. Our rough estimates give this value of order of one
kilobar, hence already moderate stress creates a serious obstacle to attaining
a stable paraexciton BEC. Thus our results indicate that BEC of trapped
paraexcitons might be achieved at a subkelvin temperature, but only under low
stress.

extensive attention in the multimedia research. Recently, several conditional
Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success.
They can generate images fitting the real face distributions conditioned on
each individual age group. However, these methods fail to capture the
transition patterns, e.g., the gradual shape and texture changes between
adjacent age groups. In this paper, we propose a novel Contextual Generative
Adversarial Nets (C-GANs) to specifically take it into consideration. The
C-GANs consists of a conditional transformation network and two discriminative
networks. The conditional transformation network imitates the aging procedure
with several specially designed residual blocks. The age discriminative network
guides the synthesized face to fit the real conditional distribution. The
transition pattern discriminative network is novel, aiming to distinguish the
real transition patterns with the fake ones. It serves as an extra
regularization term for the conditional transformation network, ensuring the
generated image pairs to fit the corresponding real transition pattern
distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework produces
appealing results by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth. We
also observe performance gain for cross-age face verification.

rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), with a total apparent magnitude m_UV = 19.7 mag.
We report here deep spectroscopic observations with the Gran Telescopio
Canarias of the optically bright lensed images of HLock01. Our results suggest
that HLock01 is a merger system composed of the Herschel-selected SMG and an
optically bright Lyman break-like galaxy (LBG), separated by only 3.3 kpc in
projection. While the SMG appears very massive (M* = 5x10^11 Msun), with a
highly extinguished stellar component (A_V = 4.3), the LBG is a young,
lower-mass (M* = 1x10^10 Msun), but still luminous (10xL*_UV) satellite galaxy.
Detailed analysis of the high signal-to-noise (S/N) rest-frame UV spectrum of
the LBG shows complex kinematics of the gas, exhibiting both blueshifted and
redshifted absorption components. While the blueshifted component is associated
with strong galactic outflows from the massive stars in the LBG, as is common
in most star-forming galaxies, the redshifted component may be associated with
gas inflow seen along a favorable sightline to the LBG. We also find evidence
of an extended gas reservoir around HLock01 at an impact parameter of 110 kpc,

reliability of jobs due to the possible failures; and (3) is generic and
flexible enough to run a wide range of data analytics jobs without requiring
any changes.
  To this end, we present a new, general geo-distributed data analytics system,
HOUTU, that is composed of multiple autonomous systems, each operating in a
sovereign data center. HOUTU maintains a job manager (JM) for a geo-distributed
job in each data center, so that these replicated JMs could individually and
cooperatively manage resources and assign tasks. Our experiments on the

provides nearly efficient job performance as in the existing centralized

the proportion of users who purchase an item (i.e., a conversion) after its
corresponding ad is clicked) is important when measuring the effects of ads
shown to users and to understanding the interests of the users. There is
generally a time delay (i.e., so-called {\it delayed feedback}) between the ad
click and conversion. Owing to the delayed feedback, samples that are converted
after an observation period may be treated as negative. To overcome this
drawback, CVR prediction assuming that the time delay follows an exponential
distribution has been proposed. In practice, however, there is no guarantee
that the delay is generated from the exponential distribution, and the best
distribution with which to represent the delay depends on the data. In this
paper, we propose a nonparametric delayed feedback model for CVR prediction
that represents the distribution of the time delay without assuming a
parametric distribution, such as an exponential or Weibull distribution.
Because the distribution of the time delay is modeled depending on the content
of an ad and the features of a user, various shapes of the distribution can be
represented potentially. In experiments, we show that the proposed model can
capture the distribution for the time delay on a synthetic dataset, even when
the distribution is complicated. Moreover, on a real dataset, we show that the
proposed model outperforms the existing method that assumes an exponential
distribution for the time delay in terms of conversion rate prediction.

specified with the language of a resource-sensitive logic. The agents are
endowed with a bag of resources and try to achieve a resource objective. For
each agent, an action consists in making available a part of their endowed
resources. All the resources made available can be used towards the agents'
objectives. We study three decision problems, the first of which is deciding
whether an action profile is a Nash equilibrium: when all the agents have
chosen an action, it is a Nash Equilibrium if no agent has an incentive to
change their action unilaterally. When dealing with resources, interesting
questions arise as to whether some equilibria can be eliminated or constructed
by a central authority by redistributing the available resources among the
agents. In our economies, division of property in divorce law exemplifies how a
central authority can redistribute the resources of individuals and why they
would desire to do so. We thus study two related decision problems: (i)
rational elimination: given an action profile's outcome, can the endowed
resources be redistributed so that it is not the outcome of a Nash equilibrium?
(ii) Rational construction: given an action profile's outcome, can the endowed
resources be redistributed so that it is the outcome of a Nash equilibrium?
Among other results, we prove that all three problems are PSPACE-complete when
the resources are described in the very expressive language of the
propositional multiplicative and additive linear logic. We also identify a new
modest fragment of linear logic that we call MULT, suitable to represent
multisets and reason about the inclusion and equality of bags of resources. We
show that when the resources are described in MULT, the problem of deciding
whether a profile is a Nash equilibrium is in PTIME.

proper time regularization to study the finite-volume effects of QCD chiral
phase transition.
  Within a cubic volume of finite size $L$, we choose the stationary wave
condition (SWC) as the real physical spatial boundary conditions of quark
fields and compare our results with that by means of commonly used
(anti-)period boundary condition (APBC or PBC). It is found that the results by
means of SWC are obviously different to the results from the APBC or PBC.
Although the three boundary conditions give the same chiral crossover
transition curve in the infinite volume limit, the limit size $L_0$ (when
$L\geq L_{0}$, the chiral quark condensate $-\left\langle { \bar \psi \psi}
\right\rangle_L$ is indistinguishable from that at $L=\infty$) using SWC is
$L_0\approx 500$ fm which is much larger than the results obtained using APBC
or PBC. More importantly, $L_0\approx 500$ fm is also much large than the
typical size of the quark-gluon plasma produced by the relativistic heavy ion
collisions. This means that the finite volume effects play a very important
role in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions. In addition, we also found that when
$L\leq 2$ fm, even at zero temperature the chiral symmetry is effectively
restored. Furthermore, to quantitatively reflect the finite volume effects on
the QCD chiral phase transition, we introduce a new vacuum susceptibility,
$\chi_{1/L}(T)=-\frac{\partial \left\langle { \bar \psi \psi}
\right\rangle}{\partial (1/L)}$. With this new vacuum susceptibility, it is
very interesting to find $\chi_{1/L}(T=0)=\chi_{1/L}(T=1/L)$ for SWC.

framework is capable to deliver sufficient performance for analysing real-world

range by an optical frequency comb has allowed the generation of microwave
signals with unprecedently high spectral purity and stability. However, the

external optical frequency comb repetition rate multiplication device is used.
This paper reports theoretical and experimental studies on the beneficial use
of the Vernier effect together with the spectral selective filtering in a
double directional coupler add-drop optical fibre ring resonator to increase
the comb repetition rate and generate high power microwaves. The studies are
focused on two selective filtering aspects: the high rejection of undesirable
optical modes of the frequency comb and the transmission of the desirable modes
with the lowest possible loss. Moreover, the conservation of the frequency comb
stability and linewidth at the resonator output is particularly considered.
Accordingly, a fibre ring resonator is designed, fabricated, and characterized,
and a technique to stabilize the resonator's resonance comb is proposed. A
significant power gain is achieved for the photonically generated beat note at

Instead of adopting the common solutions to the problem by increasing the

phase, we seek to tackle the problem by translating the real-world image
streams back to the synthetic domain during the deployment phase, to make the
robot feel at home. We propose this as a lightweight, flexible, and efficient
solution for visual control, as 1) no extra transfer steps are required during
the expensive training of DRL agents in simulation; 2) the trained DRL agents
will not be constrained to being deployable in only one specific real-world
environment; 3) the policy training and the transfer operations are decoupled,
and can be conducted in parallel. Besides this, we propose a simple yet
effective shift loss that is agnostic to the downstream task, to constrain the
consistency between subsequent frames which is important for consistent policy
outputs. We validate the shift loss for artistic style transfer for videos and
domain adaptation, and validate our visual control approach in indoor and
outdoor robotics experiments.

equations for the variables $(v,x)$, which for particular values of a control
parameter $\beta$ correspond to run and tumble motions, respectively. These
Langevin equations have analytical solutions, which make it possible to
calculate the statistical properties of both movements in detail. Assuming that
the stochastic processes $x$ and $v$ are not independent during the tumble, we
show that there are small displacements of the center of mass along the normal

unbundling during the run-to-tumble transition. Regarding the tumble we show,
by means of the directional correlation, that the process is not stationary for
tumble-times of the order of experimentally measured characteristic
tumble-time. The mean square displacement is studied in detail for both

surface of the other spin component residing in a dispersive band. The Fermi

heterostructures composed of weakly and strongly stretched domains with the
same chemical composition, as it has been demonstrated for some polymer chains,
DNA, and intermetallic nanowires supporting this effect of two-phase
stretching. These materials at relatively strong tension forces split into
domains with smaller and larger tensile strain. Within this region, average
strain increases at constant tensile force due to the growth of the domain with
the larger strain in the expense of the domain with smaller strain. Here the
two-phase stretching phenomenon is described for graphene nanoribbons with the
help of molecular dynamics simulations. This unprecedented feature of graphene
revealed in our study is related to the peculiarities of nucleation and motion
of the domain walls separating the domains with different elastic strain. It
turns out that the loading-unloading curves exhibit a hysteresis-like behavior
due to the energy dissipation during the domain wall nucleation and motion.
Here, we originally put forward the idea of implementing graphene nanoribbons
as elastic dampers, efficiently converting mechanical strain energy into heat
during cyclic loading-unloading through elastic extension where domains with
larger and smaller strain coexist. Furthermore, in the regime of two-phase
stretching, graphene nanoribbon is a heterostructure for which the fraction of

domain of the $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, subject to a
particular choice of dynamical boundary conditions of generalized Wentzell
type, whereby the boundary data solves a non-homogeneous, boundary Klein-Gordon
equation, with the source term fixed by the normal derivative of the scalar
field at the boundary. This naturally defines a field in the conformal boundary
of the Poincar\'e fundamental domain of AdS. We completely solve the equations
for the bulk and boundary fields and investigate the existence of bound state
solutions, motivated by the analogous problem with Robin boundary conditions,
which are recovered as a limiting case. Finally, we argue that both Robin and
generalized Wentzell boundary conditions are distinguished in the sense that
they are invariant under the action of the isometry group of the AdS conformal
boundary, a condition which ensures in addition that the total flux of energy
across the boundary vanishes.

and even dangerous for fragile robots, and thus, recent advances in robot
learning advocate the use of simulators as the training platform.
Unfortunately, the reality gap between synthetic and real visual data prohibits
direct migration of the models trained in virtual worlds to the real world.
This paper proposes a modular architecture for tackling the virtual-to-real
problem. The proposed architecture separates the learning model into a
perception module and a control policy module, and uses semantic image
segmentation as the meta representation for relating these two modules. The
perception module translates the perceived RGB image to semantic image
segmentation. The control policy module is implemented as a deep reinforcement
learning agent, which performs actions based on the translated image
segmentation. Our architecture is evaluated in an obstacle avoidance task and a
target following task. Experimental results show that our architecture
significantly outperforms all of the baseline methods in both virtual and real
environments, and demonstrates a faster learning curve than them. We also
present a detailed analysis for a variety of variant configurations, and
validate the transferability of our modular architecture.

jets that are largely symmetric to the jet axes and observed in some active
galactic nuclei such as M87, Mrk~501, Cyg~A, and 3C84. We find that
symmetrically limb-brightened images can be produced when magnetic field lines
of the jet penetrate a fast-spinning black hole as motivated by the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. On the other hand, jets with magnetic field lines
that pass through a slowly spinning black hole or the Keplerian accretion disk
produce highly asymmetric radio images. In addition, the edge of a counter jet
tends to be luminous in the accretion-disk model even for rather small viewing
angles, which may be problematic for some observed jets. We also suggest that
the site of particle accelerations in relativistic jets can be constrained by
fitting the radio images to observations. This kind of study focusing on the
jet images far away from the central engine is complimentary to those
concentrating directly on the innermost region with upcoming data of the Event
Horizon Telescope.

accelerated methods; the $\tau$-leaping and $R$-leaping algorithms. These
algorithms are known to be efficient under different conditions; the
$\tau$-leaping is efficient for non-stiff systems or systems with partial
equilibrium, while the $R$-leaping performs better in stiff system thanks to an
efficient sampling procedure. However, even a small change in a system's set up
can critically affect the nature of the simulated system and thus reduce the
efficiency of an accelerated algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines the
efficient time step selection from the $\tau$-leaping with the effective
sampling procedure from the $R$-leaping algorithm. The $S$-leaping is shown to
maintain its efficiency under different conditions and in the case of large and
stiff systems or systems with fast dynamics, the $S$-leaping outperforms both
methods. We demonstrate the performance and the accuracy of the $S$-leaping in
comparison with the $\tau$-leaping and $R$-leaping on a number of benchmark
systems involving biological reaction networks.

finite element methods have become increasingly popular in simulating
geophysical flows. However, robust and efficient solvers for the resulting
saddle-point and elliptic systems arising from these discretizations continue
to be an on-going challenge. One possible approach for addressing this issue is
to employ a method known as hybridization, where the discrete equations are
transformed such that classic static condensation and local post-processing
methods can be employed. However, it is challenging to implement hybridization
as performant parallel code within complex models, whilst maintaining
separation of concerns between applications scientists and software experts. In
this paper, we introduce a domain-specific abstraction within the Firedrake
finite element library that permits the rapid execution of these hybridization
techniques within a code-generating framework. The resulting framework composes
naturally with Firedrake's solver environment, allowing for the implementation
of hybridization and static condensation as runtime-configurable
preconditioners via the Python interface to PETSc, petsc4py. We provide
examples derived from second order elliptic problems and geophysical fluid
dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that hybridization shows great promise
for improving the performance of solvers for mixed finite element

this approach uses an elaborated aggregation phase. The aggregation phase is

tree based on a model with speciation and duplication where duplications are
clustered in duplication episodes. The goal is to minimize the number of such

  Future Research Directions",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Poor DRAM technology scaling over the course of many years has caused
DRAM-based main memory to increasingly become a larger system bottleneck. A
major reason for the bottleneck is that data stored within DRAM must be moved
across a pin-limited memory channel to the CPU before any computation can take
place. This requires a high latency and energy overhead, and the data often
cannot benefit from caching in the CPU, making it difficult to amortize the
overhead.
  Modern 3D-stacked DRAM architectures include a logic layer, where compute
logic can be integrated underneath multiple layers of DRAM cell arrays within
the same chip. Architects can take advantage of the logic layer to perform
processing-in-memory (PIM), or near-data processing. In a PIM architecture, the
logic layer within DRAM has access to the high internal bandwidth available
within 3D-stacked DRAM (which is much greater than the bandwidth available
between DRAM and the CPU). Thus, PIM architectures can effectively free up
valuable memory channel bandwidth while reducing system energy consumption.
  A number of important issues arise when we add compute logic to DRAM. In
particular, the logic does not have low-latency access to common CPU structures
that are essential for modern application execution, such as the virtual memory
and cache coherence mechanisms. To ease the widespread adoption of PIM, we
ideally would like to maintain traditional virtual memory abstractions and the
shared memory programming model. This requires efficient mechanisms that can
provide logic in DRAM with access to CPU structures without having to
communicate frequently with the CPU. To this end, we propose and evaluate two
general-purpose solutions that minimize unnecessary off-chip communication for
PIM architectures. We show that both mechanisms improve the performance and
energy consumption of many important memory-intensive applications.

of study data would help alleviate this, recent attempts to encourage
consistent sharing have been largely unsuccessful. Instead, we propose to
enable relative comparisons with prior work across arbitrary metrics by
predicting unreported metrics given one or more reported metrics. In addition,
we further investigate prediction of high-cost evaluation measures using
low-cost measures as a potential strategy for reducing evaluation cost. We
begin by assessing the correlation between 23 IR metrics using 8 TREC test
collections. Measuring prediction error wrt. R-square and Kendall's tau, we
show that accurate prediction of MAP, P@10, and RBP can be achieved using only
2-3 other metrics. With regard to lowering evaluation cost, we show that
RBP(p=0.95) can be predicted with high accuracy using measures with only
evaluation depth of 30. Taken together, our findings provide a valuable
proof-of-concept which we expect to spur follow-on work by others in proposing
more sophisticated models for metric prediction.

that the pressure (temperature) given by a truncated $\kappa$ distribution is

replacing the uncertainties by the identity matrix. These conditions are then
applied to the special case of linear positive systems with delays, where the
delays are considered as uncertainties. As before, under certain conditions,
the scalings can be eliminated from the conditions to obtain conditions on the
worst-case system, coinciding here with the zero-delay system -- a result that
is consistent with all the existing ones in the literature on linear positive
systems with delays. Finally, the case of switched systems with delays is
considered. The approach also encompasses standard continuous-time and
discrete-time systems, possibly with delays and the results are flexible enough
to be extended to cope with multiple delays, time-varying delays,
distributed/neutral delays and any other types of uncertain systems that can be
represented as a feedback interconnection of a known system with an
uncertainty.

the postulates are stated in diagrammatic terms, making them intuitive.
Equivalently, they are stated in category-theoretic terms, making them
mathematically appealing. Again equivalently, they are stated in
process-theoretic terms, establishing that the conceptual backbone of quantum
theory concerns the manner in which systems and processes compose.
  Aside from the diagrammatic form, the key novel aspect of this reconstruction
is the introduction of a new postulate, symmetric purification. Unlike the
ordinary purification postulate, symmetric purification applies equally well to
classical theory as well as quantum theory. Therefore we first reconstruct the
full process theoretic description of quantum theory, consisting of composite
classical-quantum systems and their interactions, before restricting ourselves
to just the `fully quantum' systems as the final step. We propose two novel
alternative manners of doing so, `no-leaking' (roughly that information gain
causes disturbance) and `purity of cups' (roughly the existence of entangled
states). Interestingly, these turn out to be equivalent in any process theory
with cups & caps. Additionally, we show how the standard purification postulate
can be seen as an immediate consequence of the symmetric purification postulate
and purity of cups.
  Other tangential results concern the specific frameworks of generalised
probabilistic theories (GPTs) and process theories (a.k.a. CQM). Firstly, we
provide a diagrammatic presentation of GPTs, which, henceforth, can be subsumed
under process theories. Secondly, we argue that the `sharp dagger' is indeed
the right choice of a dagger structure as this sharpness is vital to the
reconstruction.

the rating difference between the team and its opponent affects the match
bounty. In this work, we explain that Elo ratings and predictions can be
naturally extended to include margin-of-victory information by simply
redefining ""what it means to win."" We create ratings for each value of the
margin-of-victory and use these ratings to predict the full distribution of
point spread outcomes for matches which have not yet been played.

where the local clusters are aggregated to produce global clusters. This
approach is characterised by the fact that the local clusters are represented
in a simple and efficient way. And The aggregation phase is designed in such a

experimental conditions, or measurement contexts. The resultant probabilistic
models assume that the underlying random variables, which define a measurable
set of outcomes, can be defined independent of the measurement context. The
phenomenon is deemed contextual when this assumption fails. Contextuality is an
important issue in quantum physics. However, there has been growing speculation
that it manifests outside the quantum realm with human cognition being a
particularly prominent area of investigation. This article contributes the
foundations of a probabilistic programming language that allows convenient
exploration of contextuality in wide range of applications relevant to
cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Specific syntax is proposed to
allow the specification of ""measurement contexts"". Each such context delivers a
partial model of the phenomenon based on the associated experimental condition
described by the measurement context. The probabilistic program is translated
into a hypergraph in a modular way. Recent theoretical results from the field
of quantum physics show that contextuality can be equated with the possibility
of constructing a probabilistic model on the resulting hypergraph. The use of
hypergraphs opens the door for a theoretically succinct and efficient
computational semantics sensitive to modelling both contextual and
non-contextual phenomena. Finally, this article raises awareness of
contextuality beyond quantum physics and to contribute formal methods to detect
its presence by means of hypergraph semantics.

cities to earthquakes, to floods, to fire, etc. In a word, a system is said to
be resilient if there exists a strategy that can drive the system state back to
""normal"" after any perturbation. What formal flesh can we put on such a
malleable notion? We propose to frame the concept of resilience in the
mathematical garbs of control theory under uncertainty. Our setting covers
dynamical systems both in discrete or continuous time, deterministic or subject
to uncertainties. We will say that a system state is resilient if there exists
an adaptive strategy such that the generated state and control paths,
contingent on uncertainties, lay within an acceptable domain of random
processes, called recovery regimes. We point out how such recovery regimes can
be delineated thanks to so called risk measures, making the connection with
resilience indicators. Our definition of resilience extends others, be they ""`
a la Holling"" or rooted in viability theory. Indeed, our definition of
resilience is a form of controlability for whole random processes (regimes),
whereas others require that the state values must belong to an acceptable
subset of the state set.

order to resolve these critical limitations we introduce the regularized

based on trajectories from hydrodynamic simulations is computationally very
expensive, we rely on a steady-state model. By varying the mass and radius of
the proto-neutron star as well as electron fraction in the steady-state model,
we cover a wide range of astrophysical conditions. In our study, we find four
abundance patterns which can be formed in neutron-rich neutrino-driven ejecta.
This provides a unique template of trajectories that can be used to investigate
the impact of nuclear physics input on the nucleosynthesis for representative
astrophysical conditions. Furthermore, we link these four patterns to the
neutron-to-seed and alpha-to-seed ratios at $T=3$~GK. Therefore, our results
give a good overview of the potential nucleosynthesis evolution which can occur

composite objects formed by the arrows and corresponding vertices of their
embedded graphs. This way each category can be represented as a point in the
states space [0.1]**N. The introduction of a diffeomorphism, that acts in this
context as a functor between categories, allows to define a measure preserving
dynamical system. In particular, we apply this formalism to describe a living
single cell. We propose for its state at a given time a hirerchical category
with three levels (molecular, coarse-grained and cellular levels) related by
adequate colimits. Each level involves the main functional and structural
modules in which the cell can be partitioned. The time evolution of the cell is
drived by a transformation which is a N-dimensional generalization of the
Ricker map whose parameters we propose to be determined by requiring that, as
hallmark of its behavior, the living cell to evolve at the edge of chaos. From
the dynamical point of view this property manifests in the fact that the
largest Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero. Since in a rather complete model of
the living cell the huge number of involved parameters can make of the
calculations a hard task, we also propose a toy model, with fewer parameters to
be determined, which emphasizes the cellular fission.

  the Convolutional Neural Network",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated pavement crack detection is a challenging task that has been
researched for decades due to the complicated pavement conditions in real
world. In this paper, a supervised method based on deep learning is proposed,
which has the capability of dealing with different pavement conditions.
Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to learn the
structure of the cracks from raw images, without any preprocessing. Small
patches are extracted from crack images as inputs to generate a large training
database, a CNN is trained and crack detection is modeled as a multi-label
classification problem. Typically, crack pixels are much fewer than non-crack
pixels. To deal with the problem with severely imbalanced data, a strategy with
modifying the ratio of positive to negative samples is proposed. The method is
tested on two public databases and compared with five existing methods.
Experimental results show that it outperforms the other methods.

  Global Labels: A Weakly-Supervised Approach",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysis of histopathology slides is a critical step for many diagnoses, and
in particular in oncology where it defines the gold standard. In the case of
digital histopathological analysis, highly trained pathologists must review
vast whole-slide-images of extreme digital resolution ($100,000^2$ pixels)
across multiple zoom levels in order to locate abnormal regions of cells, or in
some cases single cells, out of millions. The application of deep learning to
this problem is hampered not only by small sample sizes, as typical datasets
contain only a few hundred samples, but also by the generation of ground-truth
localized annotations for training interpretable classification and
segmentation models. We propose a method for disease localization in the
context of weakly supervised learning, where only image-level labels are
available during training. Even without pixel-level annotations, we are able to
demonstrate performance comparable with models trained with strong annotations
on the Camelyon-16 lymph node metastases detection challenge. We accomplish
this through the use of pre-trained deep convolutional networks, feature
embedding, as well as learning via top instances and negative evidence, a
multiple instance learning technique from the field of semantic segmentation
and object detection.

energy storage. Such devices are urgently required for balancing highly
fluctuating renewable energy sources. During discharge, intermetallic phases
tend to form in the cathode of LMBs. These do not only limit the
up-scalability, but also the efficiency of the cells. Generating a mild fluid
flow in the fully liquid cell will smoothen concentration gradients and
minimise the formation of intermetallics. In this context we study
electro-vortex flow numerically. We simulate a recent LMB related experiment
and discuss how the feeding lines to the cell can be optimised to enhance mass
transfer. The Lorentz forces have to overcome the stable thermal stratification
in the cathode of the cell; we show that thermal effects may reduce
electro-vortex flow velocities considerable. Finally, we study the influence of
the Earth magnetic field on the flow.

this investigation we use insights and techniques coming from quantum

identify entities of meaning within artefacts of visual perception and rely on
how such entities are modelled for corpuses of texts such as the webpages of
the World-Wide Web for our study of how they appear in phenomena of visual
perception. We identify concretely the conjunction effect in visual artefacts
and analyse its structure in the example of a photograph. We also analyse
quantum entanglement between different aspects of meaning in artefacts of
visual perception. We confirm its presence by showing that well elected
experiments on images retrieved accordingly by Google Images give rise to
probabilities and expectation values violating the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt
version of Bell's inequalities. We point out how this approach can lead to a
mathematical description of the meaning content of a visual artefact such as a

speeds exceed 75 mph originating over tropical and subtropical waters. At
landfall, hurricanes can result in severe disasters. The accuracy of predicting
their trajectory paths is critical to reduce economic loss and save human
lives. Given the complexity and nonlinearity of weather data, a recurrent
neural network (RNN) could be beneficial in modeling hurricane behavior. We
propose the application of a fully connected RNN to predict the trajectory of
hurricanes. We employed the RNN over a fine grid to reduce typical truncation
errors. We utilized their latitude, longitude, wind speed, and pressure
publicly provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to predict the
trajectory of a hurricane at 6-hour intervals. Results show that this proposed
technique is competitive to methods currently employed by the NHC and can
predict up to approximately 120 hours of hurricane path.

each day in the world due to road traffic collision. Considering recent
researches, the human error may be considered as the main responsible for these
fatalities. Because of this, researchers seek alternatives to transfer the
vehicle control from people to autonomous systems. However, providing this
technological innovation for the people may demand complex challenges in the
legal, economic and technological areas. Consequently, carmakers and
researchers have divided the driving automation in safety and emergency systems
that improve the driver perception on the road. This may reduce the human
error. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to propose a driving
simulator platform to develop and evaluate safety and emergency systems, in the
first design stage. This driving simulator platform has an advantage: a
flexible software structure.This allows in the simulation one adaptation for
development or evaluation of a system. The proposed driving simulator platform
was tested in two applications: cooperative vehicle system development and the
influence evaluation of a Driving Assistance System (\textit{DAS}) on a driver.
In the cooperative vehicle system development, the results obtained show that
the increment of the time delay in the communication among vehicles ($V2V$) is
determinant for the system performance. On the other hand, in the influence
evaluation of a \textit{DAS} in a driver, it was possible to conclude that the
\textit{DAS'} model does not have the level of influence necessary in a driver
to avoid an accident.
