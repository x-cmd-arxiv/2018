two quarks inside the proton. Same-sign W-boson pair production is the most
promising channel for clear measurements of double parton scattering. The
left-handed nature of the coupling between quarks and W-bosons makes it a prime
probe to measure parton spin correlations. We perform a detailed analysis of
double parton scattering, including relevant backgrounds. The analysis reveals
that measurements comparing the rate at which two muons from W boson decays are
produced in the same compared to opposite hemispheres are especially sensitive
to spin correlations between two quarks inside the proton. We provide estimates
of the significance of the measurements as a function of the integrated
luminosity.

increased the operational variability in natural gas networks (GN). Towards
developing more reliable and efficient computational tools for GN monitoring,
control, and planning, this work considers the task of solving the nonlinear
equations governing steady-state flows and pressures in GNs. It is first shown
that if the gas flow equations are feasible, they enjoy a unique solution. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first result proving uniqueness of the
steady-state gas flow solution over the entire feasible domain of gas
injections. To find this solution, we put forth a mixed-integer second-order
cone program (MI-SOCP)-based solver relying on a relaxation of the gas flow
equations. This relaxation is provably exact under specific network topologies.
Unlike existing alternatives, the devised solver does not need proper
initialization or knowing the gas flow directions beforehand, and can handle
gas networks with compressors. Numerical tests on tree and meshed networks with
random gas injections indicate that the relaxation is exact even when the
derived conditions are not met.

includes some modifications necessary to deal with the severe bandwidth

resilient against message injection attacks, by recurring to majority voting
techniques applied on central community servers. Overall, SOS emerges as a
lightweight security solution, with a limited bandwidth overhead, that does not
require any modification to the hardware already deployed. Further, SOS is
standard compliant and able to reject active adversaries aiming at disrupting
the correct functioning of the communication system. Finally, comparisons

as power sources in remote or portable applications, it is desired to enhance
the efficiency of thermoelectric materials. One strategy consists of reducing
the thermal conductivity while increasing or retaining the thermoelectric power
factor. An approach to achieve this is doping to enhance the Seebeck
coefficient and electrical conductivity, while simultaneously introducing
defects in the materials to increase phonon scattering. Here, we use Mg ion
implantation to induce defects in epitaxial ScN (111) films. The films were
implanted with Mg+ ions with different concentration profiles along the
thickness of the film, incorporating 0.35 to 2.2 at.% of Mg in ScN.
Implantation at high temperature (600 C), with few defects due to the
temperature, does not substantially affect the thermal conductivity compared to
a reference ScN. Samples implanted at room temperature, in contrast, exhibited
a reduction of the thermal conductivity by a factor of three. The sample doped
with 2.2 at.% Mg also showed an increased power factor after implantation. This
study thus shows the effect of ion-induced defects on thermal conductivity of
ScN films. High-temperature implantation allows the defects to be annealed out
during implantation, while the defects are retained for room-temperature
implanted samples, allowing for a drastic reduction in thermal conductivity.

services to deploy their edge functions in a multi-tenant infrastructure
present at the edge of mobile networks. However, edge functions can be rendered
useless because of one critical issue: Web services are delivered over
end-to-end encrypted connections, so edge functions cannot operate on encrypted
traffic without compromising security or degrading performance. Any solution to
this problem must interoperate with existing protocols like TLS, as well as
with new emerging security protocols for client and IoT devices. The edge
functions must remain invisible to client-side endpoints but may require
explicit control from their service-side web services. Finally, a solution must
operate within overhead margins which do not obviate the benefits of the edge.
  To address this problem, this paper presents SPX - a solution for edge-ready
and end-to-end secure protocol extensions, which can efficiently maintain
end-to-edge-to-end ($E^3$) security semantics. Using our SPX prototype, we
allow edge functions to operate on encrypted traffic, while ensuring that
security semantics of secure protocols still hold. SPX uses Intel SGX to bind
the communication channel with remote attestation and to provide a solution
that not only defends against potential attacks but also results in low
performance overheads, and neither mandates any changes on the end-user side
nor breaks interoperability with existing protocols.

of the MAC frames transported by the FH network. Under a probabilistic model

generally, that the probabilities based on induced measures are equal across

between Hilbert-Schmidt and operator monotone (Bures, $\sqrt{x}$) measures are
also studied. Using a recently-developed golden-ratio-related (quasirandom

$p$$+$$p$, $p$$+$Al, and $p$$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The
correlations arise from inter- and intra-jet correlations and thus have
sensitivity to nonperturbative effects in both the initial and final states.
The distributions of $p_{\rm out}$, the transverse momentum component of the
associated hadron perpendicular to the trigger hadron, are sensitive to initial
and final state transverse momenta. These distributions are measured
multi-differentially as a function of $x_E$, the longitudinal momentum fraction
of the associated hadron with respect to the trigger hadron. The near-side
$p_{\rm out}$ widths, sensitive to fragmentation transverse momentum, show no
significant broadening between $p$$+$Au, $p$$+$Al, and $p$$+$$p$. The away-side
nonperturbative $p_{\rm out}$ widths are found to be broadened in $p$$+$Au when
compared to $p$$+$$p$; however, there is no significant broadening in $p$$+$Al
compared to $p$$+$$p$ collisions. The data also suggest that the away-side
$p_{\rm out}$ broadening is a function of $N_{\rm coll}$, the number of binary
nucleon-nucleon collisions, in the interaction. The potential implications of
these results with regard to initial and final state transverse momentum
broadening and energy loss of partons in a nucleus, among other nuclear
effects, are discussed.

SourceCheck 4pi ionization chamber, manufactured by PTW. Methods: The air
density dependence of three different SourceCheck 4pi chambers was studied by
measuring 125I sources. Measurements were taken by varying the pressure from
746.6 to 986.6hPa in a pressure chamber. Three different HDR 1000 Plus
ionization chambers were also analyzed under similar conditions. A linear and a
potential-like function of the air density were fitted to experimental data and
their achievement in describing them was analyzed. Results: SourceCheck 4pi
chamber response showed a residual dependence on the air density once the
standard pressure and temperature factor was applied. The chamber response was
overestimated when the air density was below that under normal atmospheric
conditions. A similar dependence was found for the HDR 1000 Plus chambers
analyzed. A linear function of the air density permitted a very good
description of this residual dependence, better than with a potential function.
No significant variability between the different specimens of the same chamber
model studied was found. Conclusion: The effect of overestimation observed in
the chamber responses once they are corrected for the standard pressure and
temperature may represent a non-negligible ~4% overestimation in high altitude
cities as ours (700 m AMSL). This overestimation behaves linearly with the air
density in all cases analyzed.

spin crossover invokes a cooperative lattice response and polyhedral
distortions at the rest of the high-spin Fe sites, translating to 3d level

addressed on the torus ${\mathbb T}^n$ in [P. Cardaliaguet, {\it Long time
average of first order mean field games and weak KAM theory}, Dyn. Games Appl.
3 (2013), 473-488], where solutions are shown to converge to the solution of a
certain ergodic mean field games system on ${\mathbb T}^n$. By adapting the
approach in [A. Fathi, E. Maderna, {\it Weak KAM theorem on non compact
manifolds}, NoDEA Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl. 14 (2007), 1-27], we
identify structural conditions on the Lagrangian, under which the corresponding
ergodic system can be solved in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then we show that time
dependent solutions converge to the solution of such a stationary system on all
compact subsets of the whole space.

reduced-density-matrix-driven complete active space self-consistent field
(v2RDM-CASSCF) procedure that employs the density-fitting (DF) approximation to
the two-electron repulsion integrals. The DF approximation significantly
reduces the computational cost of v2RDM-CASSCF gradient evaluation, in terms of
both the number of floating-point operations and memory requirements, enabling
geometry optimizations on much larger chemical systems than could previously be
considered at the this level of theory [E. Maradzike et al., J. Chem. Theory
Comput., 2017, 13, 4113-4122]. The efficacy of v2RDM-CASSCF for computing
equilibrium geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies is assessed using a
set of 25 small closed- and open-shell molecules. Equilibrium bond lengths from
v2RDM-CASSCF differ from those obtained from configuration-interaction-driven
CASSCF (CI-CASSCF) by 0.62 pm and 0.05 pm, depending on whether the optimal
reduced-density matrices from v2RDM-CASSCF satisfy two-particle
N-representability conditions (PQG) or PQG plus partial three-particle
conditions (PQG+T2), respectively. Harmonic vibrational frequencies, which are
obtained by finite differences of v2RDM-CASSCF analytic energy gradients,
similarly demonstrate that quantitative agreement between v2RDM- and CI-CASSCF
requires the consideration of partial three-particle N-representability
conditions. Lastly, optimized geometries are obtained for the lowest-energy
singlet and triplet states of the linear polyacene series up to dodecacene
(C50H28), in which case the active space is comprised of 50 electrons in 50
orbitals. The v2RDM-CASSCF singlet-triplet energy gap extrapolated to an

discovery applications, including the modelling of in vitro compound activity.
While controlling for prediction confidence is essential to increase the trust,
interpretability and usefulness of virtual screening models in drug discovery,
techniques to estimate the reliability of the predictions generated with deep
learning networks remain largely underexplored. Here, we present Deep
Confidence, a framework to compute valid and efficient confidence intervals for
individual predictions using the deep learning technique Snapshot Ensembling
and conformal prediction. Specifically, Deep Confidence generates an ensemble
of deep neural networks by recording the network parameters throughout the
local minima visited during the optimization phase of a single neural network.
This approach serves to derive a set of base learners (i.e., snapshots) with
comparable predictive power on average, that will however generate slightly
different predictions for a given instance. The variability across base
learners and the validation residuals are in turn harnessed to compute
confidence intervals using the conformal prediction framework. Using a set of
24 diverse IC50 data sets from ChEMBL 23, we show that Snapshot Ensembles
perform on par with Random Forest (RF) and ensembles of independently trained
deep neural networks. In addition, we find that the confidence regions
predicted using the Deep Confidence framework span a narrower set of values.
Overall, Deep Confidence represents a highly versatile error prediction
framework that can be applied to any deep learning-based application at no
extra computational cost.

microchannel has a linearly elastic and compliant top wall, while its three
other walls are rigid. The fluid flowing inside the microchannel has a
shear-dependent viscosity described by the power-law rheological model. We
employ lubrication theory to solve for the flow problem inside the long and
shallow microchannel. For the structural problem, we employ two plate theories,
namely Kirchhoff-Love theory of thin plates and Reissner-Mindlin first-order
shear deformation theory. The hydrodynamic pressure couples the flow and
deformation problem by acting as a distributed load onto the soft top wall.
Within our perturbative (lubrication theory) approach, we determine the
relationship between flow rate and the pressure gradient, which is a nonlinear
first-order ordinary differential equation for the pressure. From the solution
of this differential equation, all other quantities of interest in
non-Newtonian microchannel FSIs follow. Through illustrative examples, we show
the effect of FSI coupling strength and the plate thickness on the pressure
drop across the microchannel. Through direct numerical simulation of
non-Newtonian microchannel FSIs using commercial computational engineering
tools, we benchmark the prediction from our mathematical prediction for the
flow rate-pressure drop relation and the structural deformation profile of the
top wall. In doing so, we also establish the limits of applicability of our
perturbative theory.

pericenter of Iapetus and planetary secular mode $g_5$, Iapetus's longitude of
the node and Saturn's equinox. We find that this argument currently (on a
$10^7$~yr timescale) appears to librate with a very large amplitude. On longer
timescales, the behavior of this resonant angle is strongly dependent on the
resonant interaction between Saturn's spin axis and the planetary mode $f_8$,
with long-term secular resonance being possible if Saturn's equinox is
librating relative to the node of the $f_8$ eigenmode. We present analytical
estimates of the dependence of the resonant argument on the orbital elements of
Iapetus. We find that this Iapetus-$g_5$ secular resonance could have been
established only after the passage of Iapetus through the 5:1 mean-motion

dosimetry approaches in the case of a small field dedicated `D'-shaped
collimator used for the retinoblastoma treatment with external photon beam
radiotherapy.
  Methods: The Monte Carlo code {\sc penelope} is used to simulate the linac,
the dedicated collimator and a water phantom. The absolute doses (in Gy per
monitor unit) for the field sizes considered are obtained within the approach
of Popescu {\it et al.} in which the tallied backscattered dose in the monitor
chamber is accounted for. The results are compared to experimental data, to
those found with a simpler Monte Carlo approximation for the calculation of
absolute doses and to those provided by the analytical anisotropic algorithm.
Our analysis allows for the study of the simulation tracking parameters. Two
sets of parameters have been considered for the simulation of the particle
transport in the linac target.
  Results: The change in the tracking parameters produced non-negligible
differences, of about 10\% or larger, in the doses estimated in reference
conditions. The Monte Carlo results for the absolute doses differ from the
experimental ones by 2.6\% and 1.7\% for the two parameter sets for the
collimator geometries analyzed. For the studied fields, the simpler approach
produces absolute doses that are statistically compatible with those obtained
with the approach of Popescu {\it et al.} The analytical anisotropic algorithm
underestimates the experimental absolute doses with discrepancies larger than
those found for Monte Carlo results.
  Conclusions: The approach studied can be considered for absolute dosimetry in
the case of small, `D'-shaped and off-axis radiation fields. However, a
detailed description of the radiation transport in the linac target is
mandatory for an accurate absolute dosimetry.

be integrable and conserved in the absence of a flux term at null infinity,

analogous terms in general provide obstructions to the integrability of the
corresponding charges. Since the subleading terms are defined close to null
infinity, but vanish actually at infinity, the analogous obstructions are not

In contrast, I2P does not rely on centralized directory servers, and thus
obtaining a complete view of the network is challenging. In this work, we
conduct an empirical study of the I2P network, in which we measure properties
including population, churn rate, router type, and the geographic distribution

blocking techniques. Despite the decentralized characteristics of I2P, we
discover that a censor can block more than 95% of peer IP addresses known by a
stable I2P client by operating only 10 routers in the network. This amounts to
severe network impairment: a blocking rate of more than 70% is enough to cause
significant latency in web browsing activities, while blocking more than 90% of
peer IP addresses can make the network unusable. Finally, we discuss the
security consequences of the network being blocked, and directions for
potential approaches to make I2P more resistant to blocking.

highly nonclassical magnetization states. Using fully quantum many-body
treatment, where an electron injected as spin-polarized wave packet interacts
with local spins comprising the anisotropic quantum Heisenberg ferromagnetic
chain, we define quantum STT as any time evolution of local spins due to
initial many-body state not being an eigenstate of electron+local-spins system.
For time evolution caused by injected spin-down electron scattering off local
up-spins, entanglement between electron subsystem and local spins subsystem
takes place leading to decoherence and, therefore, shrinking of the total
magnetization but without rotation from its initial orientation which explains
the experiments. Furthermore, the same processes---entanglement and thereby
induced decoherence---are present also in standard noncollinear geometry,
together with the usual magnetization rotation. This is because STT in quantum
many-body picture is caused only by electron spin-down factor state, and the
only difference between collinear and noncollinear geometries is in relative
size of the contribution of initial many-body state containing such factor
state to superpositions of separable many-body quantum states generated during

response regime dominated by pre-existing Mott resonances, which exists
provided Floquet saturation is not reached within a period; a non-linear
perturbative regime, which exhibits multiphoton-absorption in response to the
field; a near-adiabatic regime, which exhibits a primarily reactive response
spread over the entire sample and is insensitive to pre-existing resonances;
and finally an enhanced dissipative regime.

with shear flow. They are a potentially attractive explanation for the high
ions such as OVI seen in high velocity clouds and the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) of galaxies. We perform 3D MHD simulations with non-equilibrium (NEI) and
photoionization modeling, with an eye towards testing simple analytic models.
Even purely hydrodynamic collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) calculations
have column densities much lower than observations. Characteristic inflow and
turbulent velocities are much less than the shear velocity, and the layer width
$h \propto t_\mathrm{cool}^{1/2}$ rather than $h \propto t_\mathrm{cool}$.
Column densities are not independent of density or metallicity as analytic
scalings predict, and show surprisingly weak dependence on shear velocity and
density contrast. Radiative cooling, rather than Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
appears paramount in determining the saturated state. Low pressure due to fast
cooling both seeds turbulence and sets the entrainment rate of hot gas, whose
enthalpy flux, along with turbulent dissipation, energizes the layer.
Regardless of initial geometry, magnetic fields are amplified and stabilize the
mixing layer via magnetic tension, producing almost laminar flow and depressing
column densities. NEI effects can boost column densities by factors of a few.
Suppression of cooling by NEI or photoionization can in principle also increase
OVI column densities, but in practice is unimportant for CGM conditions. To
explain observations, sightlines must pierce hundreds or thousands of mixing
layers, which may be plausible if the CGM exists as a `fog' of tiny cloudlets.

fractal structure as graphene subject to a perpendicular magnetic field, but
with no spin degeneracy due to broken time-reversal symmetry by the
ferromagnetic order. In addition, the magnonic Dirac points and Landau levels
occur at finite energy as expected in a bosonic system. Remarkably, this
discrepancy does not affect the topological invariant of the system.
Consequently, the magnonic Chern number assumes odd values and the magnon Hall
conductance gets quantized by odd integers. In the case of both space- and
time-dependent electric field, the theoretical framework is studied by the
Floquet formalism. We show that the magnonic Floquet Hofstadter spectrum
emerges entirely from the oscillating space- and time-dependent electric field,

study, which utilizes new, deep data from Chandra and Hubble, along with
ground-based spectroscopy from Gemini and Magellan, improves significantly on
previous studies in both depth and angular resolution, allowing us to directly
compare to clusters at z~0. We find that the temperature, density, and entropy
profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) are very similar among the four
clusters, and share similar shapes to clusters at z~0. Specifically, we find no
evidence for deviations from self similarity in the temperature profile over
the radial range 10kpc < r < 1Mpc, implying that the processes responsible for
preventing runaway cooling over the past >6 Gyr are, at least roughly,
preserving self similarity. We find typical metallicities of ~0.3 Zsun in the
bulk of the ICM, rising to ~0.5 Zsun in the inner ~100 kpc, and reaching ~1
Zsun at r < 10kpc. This central excess is similar in magnitude to what is
observed in the most relaxed clusters at z~0, suggesting that both the global
metallicity and the central excess that we see in cool core clusters at z~0
were in place very early in the cluster lifetime and, specifically, that the
central excess is not due to late-time enrichment by the central galaxy.
Consistent with observations at z~0, we measure a diversity of stellar
populations in the central brightest cluster galaxies of these four clusters,
with star formation rates spanning a factor of ~500, despite the similarity in
cooling time, cooling rate, and central entropy. These data suggest that, while
the details vary dramatically from system to system, runaway cooling has been
broadly regulated in relaxed clusters over the past 6 Gyr.

pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson $\chi$ with decay constant $f\sim \mathrm{TeV}$.
This type of WIMP is especially compelling because its leading interaction with
the Standard Model, the derivative Higgs portal, has the correct annihilation
strength for thermal freeze-out if $m_\chi \sim O(100)$ GeV, but is negligible
in direct detection experiments due to the very small momentum transfer. The
explicit breaking of the shift symmetry which radiatively generates $m_\chi$,
however, introduces non-derivative DM interactions. In existing realizations a
marginal Higgs portal coupling $\lambda$ is generated with size comparable to
the Higgs quartic, and thus well within reach of XENON1T. Here, we present and
analyze the interesting case where the pattern of explicit symmetry breaking
naturally suppresses $\lambda$ beyond the reach of current and future direct
detection experiments. If the DM acquires mass from bottom quark loops, the
bottom quark also mediates suppressed DM-nucleus scattering with cross sections
that will be eventually probed by LZ. Alternatively, the DM can obtain mass
from gauging its stabilizing $U(1)$ symmetry. No direct detection signal is
expected even at future facilities, but the introduction of a dark photon
$\gamma_D$ has a number of phenomenological implications which we study in
detail, treating $m_{\gamma_D}$ as a free parameter. Complementary probes of
the dark sector include indirect DM detection, DM self-interactions, and extra
radiation, as well as collider experiments. We frame our discussion in an
effective field theory, motivating our parameter choices with a detailed
analysis of an $SO(7)/SO(6)$ composite Higgs model, which can yield either

the stellar masses are internally consistent within their range of

also yields representative stellar masses. The various SFR estimates show
intrinsic differences and produce noticeable vertical shifts in the SFMS,
depending on the timescales and physics encompassed by the corresponding
tracer. SFR estimates appear to break down on physical scales below 500 pc. We
also examine the various sources of scatter in the spatially resolved SFMS and
find morphology does not play a significant role. We identify three unique
tracks across the SFMS by individual galaxies, delineated by a critical stellar
mass density of log (\Sigma_M*)~7.5. Below this scale, the SFMS shows no clear
trend and is likely driven by local, stochastic internal processes. Above this

have the median metallicity of the LMC, [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, which is typical of
other galaxies of similar mass to the MW. At the end of this exceptional event,
the MW will become a true benchmark for spiral galaxies, at least temporarily.

$\rm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with one flavor of dark quark. The model is confining
at low energy and we use lattice simulations to investigate the properties of
the lowest-lying hadrons. Compared to QCD, the theory has several peculiar
differences: there are no Goldstone bosons or chiral symmetry restoration when
the dark quark becomes massless; the usual global baryon number symmetry is
enlarged to $\rm{SU}(2)_B$, resembling isospin; and baryons and mesons are
unified together in $\rm{SU}(2)_B$ iso-multiplets. We argue that the lightest
baryon, a vector boson, is a stable dark matter candidate and is a composite
realization of the hidden vector dark matter scenario. The model naturally
includes a lighter state, the analog of the $\eta^\prime$ in QCD, for dark
matter to annihilate into to set the relic density via thermal freeze-out. Dark
matter baryons may also be asymmetric, strongly self-interacting, or have their
relic density set via $3 \to 2$ cannibalizing transitions. We discuss some
experimental implications of coupling dark baryons to the Higgs portal.

the background source it affects, provided the lensed source can be
reconstructed as if it was seen in the absence of lensing. In the present work,
we illustrate how sparse optimisation can address the problem. As a first step
towards a full free-form lens modelling technique, we consider linear inversion
of the lensed source under sparse regularisation and joint deblending from the
lens light profile. The method is based on morphological component analysis,
assuming a known mass model. We show with numerical experiments that
representing the lens and source light using an undecimated wavelet basis
allows us to reconstruct the source and to separate it from the foreground lens
at the same time. Both the source and lens light have a non-analytic form,
allowing for the flexibility needed in the inversion to represent arbitrarily
small and complex luminous structures in the lens and source. in addition,
sparse regularisation avoids over-fitting the data and does not require the use
of any adaptive mesh or pixel grid. As a consequence, our reconstructed sources
can be represented on a grid of very small pixels. Sparse regularisation in the
wavelet domain also allows for automated computation of the regularisation
parameter, thus minimising the impact of arbitrary choice of initial
parameters. Our inversion technique for a fixed mass distribution can be
incorporated in future lens modelling technique iterating over the lens mass
parameters. The python package corresponding to the algorithms described in

thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disk. The outburst timescales
constrain $\alpha$, the ratio of the viscous stress to the thermal pressure,
and so the mechanism of angular momentum transport. The eruptive state has
$\alpha\approx0.1$ while the quiescent state has $\alpha\approx0.03$. Turbulent
transport due to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is generally
considered to be the source of angular momentum transport in DNe. Here, we
perform 3D local magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shearing box simulations including
vertical stratification, radiative transfer and a net constant vertical
magnetic flux to investigate how transport changes between the outburst and
quiescent states of DNe. We find that a constant $B_z$ provides a higher
$\alpha$ in quiescence than in outburst, in opposition to what is expected.
Including resistivity quenches MRI turbulence in quiescence, suppressing
transport, unless the magnetic field is high enough, which again leads to
$\alpha\approx0.1$. A major difference between simulations with a net poloidal
flux and simulations without is that angular momentum transport in the former
is shared between turbulent and wind-driven transport. We find that wind-driven
transport dominates in quiescence even for low magnetic fields $\sim 1$ G. This
can have a major impact on observational signatures since wind-driven transport
does not heat the disk. Furthermore, wind transport cannot be reduced to an
$\alpha$ prescription. We provide fits for $\alpha$ and the wind torque with
$\beta$, ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure. We conclude that the evolution
of the thermal-viscous instability, and its consequences on the outburst cycles
of CVs, needs to be seriously revised to take into account that most of the
accretion energy may be carried away by a wind instead of being locally
dissipated.

universes that interact with each other on a quantum level based on a
field-theoretical formulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This interaction
leads to the appearance of a pre-inflationary phase in the evolution of the
individual universes. We analyze scalar perturbations within the model and
calculate the influence of the pre-inflationary phase onto the power spectrum
of these perturbations. The result is that there is a suppression of power on
large scales, which can describe well the Planck 2018 data for the cosmic
microwave background anisotropies and could thus indicate a possible solution
to the observed quadrupole discrepancy.

problem in data analysis. We develop a fast statistical test of the null
hypothesis that a Fourier-like power spectrum is consistent with noise. The
null hypothesis is rejected where the local ""coefficient of variation""
(CV)---the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean---in a power spectrum
deviates significantly from expectations for pure noise (CV~1.0 for a Chi^2
2-degrees-of-freedom distribution). This technique is of particular utility for
detecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds,
as it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected
frequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the
presence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are
dominated by stellar granulation. This approach circumvents the need for
background fitting to measure the frequency of maximum solar-like oscillation
power, nu_max. In this paper, we derive the basic method and demonstrate its
ability to detect the pulsational power excesses from the well-studied
APOKASC-2 sample of oscillating red giants observed by Kepler. We recover the
cataloged nu_max values with an average precision of 2.7% for 99.4% of the
stars with 4 years of Kepler photometry. Our method produces false positives
for <1% of dwarf stars with nu_max well above the long-cadence Nyquist
frequency. The algorithm also flags spectra that exhibit astrophysically
interesting signals in addition to single, solar-like oscillation power
excesses, which we catalog as part of our characterization of the Kepler light

narrow line Seyfert galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 (Parker et al. 2017a). The ultrafast
outflow was first inferred through the detection of highly blueshifted
absorption lines (Parker et al. 2017a) and then confirmed with a principal
component analysis (PCA) (Parker et al. 2017b). Two of the reported properties
of this outflow differed from those typically detected in other AGN with
ultrafast outflows. First, the outflow velocity was found not to vary with
v=0.236c +/- 0.006c. Second, the equivalent width of the highly blueshifted
absorption line was reported to be anti-correlated with the 3-10 keV flux of
this source. We present a re-analysis of the XMM-Newton observations of IRAS
13224-3809 considering the influence of background. We also undertook a
different analysis approach in combining the spectra and investigated the
change of the properties of the outflow as a function of 3-10 keV flux and
time. We confirm the presence of an ultrafast outflow in IRAS 13224-3809,
however, we find that the background spectra used in the Parker et al. analyses
dominate the source spectra for energies near the blueshifted iron lines. By
reducing the source extraction regions to improve the signal-to-noise ratio we
discover larger than previously reported outflow velocities and find that the
outflow velocity varies from ~0.2c to ~0.3c and increases with 3-10~keV flux.
The previously reported anti-correlation between equivalent width of the iron
line and 3-10 keV flux disappears when the background spectra are reduced by
optimizing the source extraction regions.

quiescent LMXB lightcurves including ellipsoidal modulation and stochastic
flaring, and then sample these using LSST's operations simulator (OpSim) over

of possible reddening values. The percentage of simulated parameter space with
correctly returned periods ranges from $\sim$23 %, for the current baseline
strategy, to $\sim$70 % for the two simulated specialist strategies. Convolving
these results with a $P_{orb}$ distribution, a modelled Galactic spatial

recent version of the LSST baseline strategy will allow $P_{orb}$ determination

not reduce observations of the Galactic Plane can improve this dramatically to

of the D-shaped collimator used at the Univ. Hosp. of Essen for retinoblastoma
treatment that reduces even further the irradiation field with the scope to
reduce the risk of radio-induced secondary malignancies. The new dedicated
D-shaped collimator is easier to build and produces dose distributions that
only differ on the field size with respect to the dose distributions obtained
by the current collimator in use.
  Methods: The Monte Carlo code PENELOPE was used to study the effect that the
structural elements of the collimator have on the absorbed dose distribution.
The radiation transport through a Varian Clinac 2100 C/D operating at 6MV was
simulated in order to tally phase-space files which were used as radiation
sources to simulate the considered collimators and the subsequent dose
distributions.
  Results: The proposed collimator delivers a dose distribution which is 2.4cm
wide along the inferior-superior direction of the eyeball. This width is 0.3cm
narrower than that of the dose distribution obtained with the collimator
currently in use. The other relevant characteristics of the dose distribution
obtained with the new collimator, namely, depth doses, penumbrae width and
shape of the lateral profiles, are statistically compatible with the results
obtained for the collimator in use.
  Conclusions: The smaller field size delivered by the proposed collimator
still fully covers the planning target volume with at least 95% of the maximum
dose at a depth of 2cm and provides a safety margin of 0.2cm, so ensuring an
adequate treatment while reducing the dose absorbed by surrounding structures
of the eye.

information, limited sensing capabilities, and inherently stochastic
environments, making individual observations incomplete and unreliable.
Moreover, in many situations it is preferable to delay a decision rather than
run the risk of making a bad decision. In such situations it is necessary to
aggregate information before taking an action; however, most state of the art
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are biased towards taking actions
\textit{at every time step}, even if the agent is not particularly confident in
its chosen action. This lack of caution can lead the agent to make critical
mistakes, regardless of prior experience and acclimation to the environment.
Motivated by theories of dynamic resolution of uncertainty during decision
making in biological brains, we propose a simple accumulator module which
accumulates evidence in favor of each possible decision, encodes uncertainty as
a dynamic competition between actions, and acts on the environment only when it
is sufficiently confident in the chosen action. The agent makes no decision by
default, and the burden of proof to make a decision falls on the policy to
accrue evidence strongly in favor of a single decision. Our results show that
this accumulator module achieves near-optimal performance on a simple guessing
game, far outperforming deep recurrent networks using traditional, forced

possibly ONe for the most massive stars) build up during the core helium
burning (CHeB) and thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phases.
Through the interpretation of their pulsation periods by means of
asteroseismology, details about their origin and evolution can be inferred. The
whole pulsation spectrum exhibited by ZZ Ceti stars strongly depend on the
inner chemical structure. At present, there are several processes affecting the
chemical profiles that are still not accurately determined. We present a study
of the impact of current uncertainties in the evolution of white dwarf
progenitor on the expected pulsation properties and on the stellar parameters
inferred from asteroseismological fits of ZZ Ceti stars. Our analysis is based
on a set of carbon-oxygen core white dwarf models that are derived from full
evolutionary computations from the ZAMS to the ZZ Ceti domain. We considered
models in which we varied the number of thermal pulses, the amount of
overshooting, and the carbon-alpha reaction rate within their uncertainties. We
explore the impact of these major uncertainties in prior evolution on the
chemical structure and expected pulsation spectrum. We find that these
uncertainties yield significant changes in the g-mode pulsation periods being
those found during the TP-AGB phase the most relevant for the pulsational
properties and the asteroseismological derived stellar parameters of ZZ Ceti
stars. We conclude that the uncertainties in the white dwarf progenitor
evolution should be taken into account in detailed asteroseismological analyses
of these pulsating stars.

problems on matrix spaces where the variables are positive semidefinite

of variational inequality (VI) has focused on addressing VIs on vector
spaces.Yet, most existing methods either rely on strong assumptions, or require
a two-loop framework where at each iteration, a projection problem, i.e., a
semidefinite optimization problem needs to be solved. Motivated by this gap, we
develop a stochastic mirror descent method where we choose the distance
generating function to be defined as the quantum entropy. This method is a
single-loop first-order method in the sense that it only requires a
gradient-type of update at each iteration. The novelty of this work lies in the
convergence analysis that is carried out through employing an auxiliary
sequence of stochastic matrices. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) under this
setting and employing averaging techniques, we show that the iterate generated
by the algorithm converges to a weak solution of the SVI; (ii) moreover, we
derive a convergence rate in terms of the expected value of a suitably defined
gap function; (iii) we implement the developed method for solving a

atmospheric parameters were determined spectroscopically from Fe I lines,
taking into account <3D> non-LTE corrections and using differential abundances
with respect to a set of standards. Of the 126 new stars, 124 have [Fe/H]<-1.5,
105 have [Fe/H]<-2.0, and 4 have [Fe/H]<-3.0. Nine new carbon-enhanced
metal-poor stars have been discovered, 3 of which are enhanced in r-process
elements. Abundances of neutron-capture elements reveal 60 new r-I stars (with
+0.3<=[Eu/Fe]<=+1.0 and [Ba/Eu]<0) and 4 new r-II stars (with [Eu/Fe]>+1.0).
Nineteen stars are found to exhibit a `limited-r' signature ([Sr/Ba]>+0.5,
[Ba/Eu]<0). For the r-II stars, the second- and third-peak main r-process
patterns are consistent with the r-process signature in other metal-poor stars
and the Sun. The abundances of the light, alpha, and Fe-peak elements match
those of typical Milky Way halo stars, except for one r-I star which has high
Na and low Mg, characteristic of globular cluster stars. Parallaxes and proper
motions from the second Gaia data release yield UVW space velocities for these
stars which are consistent with membership in the Milky Way halo. Intriguingly,
all r-II and the majority of r-I stars have retrograde orbits, which may
indicate an accretion origin.

variations in atmospheric transparency in excess of 0.01 mag are common, and
0.01 mag photometry cannot be achieved by using a constant flat field
calibration image. We therefore have assembled an all-sky reference catalog of
approximately one billion stars to m~19 from a variety of sources to calibrate

uncertainty about means or totals for each of several non-overlapping
subpopulations, or areas. When the sample size for a given area is small,
standard confidence intervals based on data only from that area can be
unacceptably wide. In order to reduce interval width, practitioners often
utilize multilevel models in order to borrow information across areas,
resulting in intervals centered around shrinkage estimators. However, such
intervals only have the nominal coverage rate on average across areas under the
assumed model for across-area heterogeneity. The coverage rate for a given area
depends on the actual value of the area mean, and can be nearly zero for areas
with means that are far from the across-group average. As such, the use of
uncertainty intervals centered around shrinkage estimators are inappropriate
when area-specific coverage rates are desired. In this article, we propose an
alternative confidence interval procedure for area means and totals under
normally distributed sampling errors. This procedure not only has constant
$1-\alpha$ frequentist coverage for all values of the target quantity, but also
uses auxiliary information to borrow information across areas. Because of this,
the corresponding intervals have shorter expected lengths than standard
confidence intervals centered on the unbiased direct estimator. Importantly,
the coverage of the procedure does not depend on the assumed model for
across-area heterogeneity. Rather, improvements to the model for across-area
heterogeneity result in reduced expected interval width.

can be treated external radiotherapy. The purpose of this work is to evaluate
the adequacy of Monte Carlo simulations and the accuracy of a commercial
treatment planning system by means of experimental measurements. Dose
measurements in water were performed using a dedicated collimator.
  Methods: A 6MV Varian Clinac 2100 C/D and a dedicated collimator are used for
RB treatment. The collimator conforms a D-shaped off-axis field whose
irradiated area can be either 5.2 or 3.1cm$^2$. Depth dose distributions and
lateral profiles were measured and compared with Monte Carlo simulations run
with PENELOPE and with calculations performed with the analytical anisotropic
algorithm (AAA) using the gamma test.
  Results: PENELOPE simulations agree well with the experimental data with
discrepancies in the dose profiles less than 3mm of distance-to-agreement and
3% of dose. Discrepancies between the results of AAA and the experimental data
reach 3mm and 6%. The agreement in the penumbra region between AAA and the
experiment is noticeably worse than that between the latter and PENELOPE. The
percentage of voxels passing the gamma test when comparing PENELOPE (AAA) and
the experiment is on average 99% (93%) assuming a 3mm distance-to-agreement and
a discrepancy of 3% of dose.
  Conclusions: Although the discrepancies between AAA and experimental results
are noticeable, it is possible to consider this algorithm for routine treatment
planning of RB patients, provided the limitations of the algorithm are known
and taken into account by the medical physicist. Monte Carlo simulation is
essential for knowing these limitations. Monte Carlo simulation is required for
optimizing the treatment technique and the dedicated collimator.

require many rounds of communication between the server and the clients holding
the data points. Yet multi-round protocols are prohibitively slow in practice
due to network latency and, as a result, currently deployed large-scale systems
are limited to a single round. Despite significant research interest, very
little is known about which learning problems can be solved by such
non-interactive systems. The only lower bound we are aware of is for PAC
learning an artificial class of functions with respect to a uniform
distribution (Kasiviswanathan et al. 2011).
  We show that the margin complexity of a class of Boolean functions is a lower
bound on the complexity of any non-interactive LDP algorithm for
distribution-independent PAC learning of the class. In particular, the classes
of linear separators and decision lists require exponential number of samples
to learn non-interactively even though they can be learned in polynomial time
by an interactive LDP algorithm. This gives the first example of a natural
problem that is significantly harder to solve without interaction and also
resolves an open problem of Kasiviswanathan et al. (2011). We complement this
lower bound with a new efficient learning algorithm whose complexity is
polynomial in the margin complexity of the class. Our algorithm is
non-interactive on labeled samples but still needs interactive access to
unlabeled samples. All of our results also apply to the statistical query model
and any model in which the number of bits communicated about each data point is
constrained.

the evolution of massive stars with different values for the fundamental
constants. We focus on variations in the triple alpha resonance energy and
study its effects on the resulting abundances of $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, and larger
nuclei. In our universe, the $0^{+}$ energy level of carbon supports a resonant
nuclear reaction that dominates carbon synthesis in stellar cores and accounts
for the observed cosmic abundances. Here we define $\Delta{E}_R$ to be the
change in this resonant energy level, and show how different values affect the
cosmic abundances of the intermediate alpha elements. Using the state of the
art computational package $MESA$, we carry out stellar evolution calculations
for massive stars in the range $M_\ast$ = $15-40M_\odot$, and for a wide range
of resonance energies. We also include both solar and low metallicity initial
conditions. For negative $\Delta{E}_R$ , carbon yields are increased relative
to standard stellar models, and such universes remain viable as long as the
production of carbon nuclei remains energetically favorable, and stars remain
stable, down to $\Delta{E}_R\approx-300$ keV. For positive $\Delta{E}_R$,
carbon yields decrease, but significant abundances can be produced for
resonance energy increments up to $\Delta{E}_R\approx+500$ keV. Oxygen yields
tend to be anti-correlated with those of carbon, and the allowed range in
$\Delta{E}_R$ is somewhat smaller. We also present yields for neon, magnesium,
and silicon. With updated stellar evolution models and a more comprehensive
survey of parameter space, these results indicate that the range of viable
universes is larger than suggested by earlier studies.

models with non-minimal couplings of the scalar fields to the Ricci scalar,
that are conformal invariant, the spontaneous generation by a scalar field(s)
vev of a positive Newton constant demands a negative kinetic term for the
scalar field, or vice-versa. This is naturally avoided in models with
additional Weyl gauge symmetry. The Weyl gauge field $\omega_\mu$ couples to
the scalar sector but not to the fermionic sector of a SM-like Lagrangian. The
field $\omega_\mu$ undergoes a Stueckelberg mechanism and becomes massive after
""eating"" the (radial mode) would-be-Goldstone field (dilaton $\rho$) in the
scalar sector. Before the decoupling of $\omega_\mu$, the dilaton can act as UV
regulator and maintain the Weyl symmetry at the {\it quantum} level, with
relevance for solving the hierarchy problem. After the decoupling of
$\omega_\mu$, the scalar potential depends only on the remaining (angular
variables) scalar fields, that can be the Higgs field, inflaton, etc. We show
that successful inflation is then possible with one of these scalar fields
identified as the inflaton. While our approach is derived in the Riemannian
geometry with $\omega_\mu$ introduced to avoid ghosts, the natural framework is
that of Weyl geometry which for the same matter spectrum is shown to generate
the same Lagrangian, up to a total derivative.

coevolutionary patterns that emerge from antagonistic interactions. These
models usually assume that the attacks by the exploiters are random, so the
effect of victim selection by exploiters on coevolutionary patterns remains
unexplored. Here we analytically studied the payoff for predators and prey
under coevolution assuming that every individual predator can attack only a
small number of prey any given time, considering two scenarios: (i) predation
occurs at random; (ii) predators select prey according to phenotype matching.
We also develop an individual based model to verify the robustness of our
analytical prediction. We show that both scenarios result in well known similar
coevolutionary patterns if population sizes are sufficiently high: symmetrical
coevolutionary branching and symmetrical coevolutionary cycling (Red Queen
dynamics). However, for small population sizes, prey selection can cause
unexpected coevolutionary patterns. One is the breaking of symmetry of the
coevolutionary pattern, where the phenotypes evolve towards one of two
evolutionarily stable patterns. As population size increases, the phenotypes
oscillate between these two values in a novel form of Red Queen dynamics, the
episodic reversal between the two stable patterns. Thus, prey selection causes
prey phenotypes to evolve towards more extreme values, which reduces the
fitness of both predators and prey, increasing the likelihood of extinction.

constant exchange with the gas phase via accretion and desorption mechanisms
such as UV, X-ray photodesorption, cosmic ray induced sputtering, grain thermal
fluctuations, and chemical reaction energy release. The relative importance of
the various desorption mechanisms is of uttermost importance for astrophysical
models to constrain the chemical evolution in such high density dense cloud
regions. In this experimental work we investigated the sputtering yield as a
function of ice mantle thickness, exposed to Xe ions at 95MeV. The ion induced
ice phase transformation and the sputtering yield were simultaneously monitored
by IR spectroscopy and mass spec- trometry, respectively. The sputtering yield
is constant above a characteristic ice layer thickness and starts to decrease
below this thickness. An estimate of the sputtering depth corresponding to this
length can be evaluated. In these experiments the measured desorption depth
corresponds to 30 ice layers. Assuming an effective cylindrical shape for the
volume of sputtered molecules, the aspect ratio is close to unity; in the
semi-infinite ice film case this ratio is the diameter to height of the
cylinder. This result shows that most ejected molecules arise from a rather
compact volume. The measured infinite thickness sputtering yield for water ice
mantles scales as the square of the ion electronic stopping power (Se). We
expect that the desorption depth dependence varies with Se^a , where a=0.5.
Astrophysical models should take into account the thickness dependence
constraints of these ice mantles in the interface regions when ices are close
to their extinction threshold. In the very dense cloud regions, most of the
water ice mantles are above this limit for the bulk of the cosmic rays.

been considered as one of the most promising tools to investigate two-phase
flow and boiling system for engineering purposes. The MCFD solver requires
closure relations to make the conservation equations solvable. The wall boiling
closure relations, for example, provide predictions on wall superheat and heat
partitioning. The accuracy of these closure relations significantly influences
the predictive capability of the solver. In this paper, a study of validation
and uncertainty quantification (VUQ) for the wall boiling closure relations in
MCFD solver is performed. The work has three purposes: i). identify influential
parameters to the quantities of interest of the boiling system through
sensitivity analysis; ii). evaluate the parameter uncertainty through Bayesian
inference with the support of multiple datasets; iii). quantitatively measure
the agreement between solver predictions and datasets. The widely used
Kurul-Podowski wall boiling closure relation is studied in this paper. Several
statistical methods are used, including Morris screening method for global
sensitivity analysis, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inverse Bayesian
inference, and confidence interval as the validation metric. The VUQ results
indicated that the current empirical correlations-based wall boiling closure
relations achieved satisfactory agreement on wall superheat predictions.
However, the closure relations also demonstrate intrinsic inconsistency and
fail to give consistently accurate predictions for all quantities of interest
over the well-developed nucleate boiling regime.

macroscopic arrangement, rather than their microscopic constituency. They can
be designed by starting from Dirac metamaterials with either symmetry-enforced
or accidental degeneracy. The latter case provides greater flexibility in the
design of topological switches, waveguides, and cloaking devices, because a
large number of tuning parameters can be used to break the degeneracy and
induce a topological phase. However, the design of a topological logic
element--a switch that can be controlled by the output of a separate
switch--remains elusive. Here we numerically demonstrate a topological logic
gate for ultrasound by exploiting the large phase space of accidental
degeneracies in a honeycomb lattice. We find that a degeneracy can be broken by
six physical parameters, and we show how to tune these parameters to create a
phononic switch that transitions between a topological waveguide and a trivial
insulator by ultrasonic heating. Our design scheme is directly applicable to
photonic crystals and may guide the design of future electronic topological
transistors.

paper we extend this concept to quasicrystalline parallelogram tillings and we
use the Penrose tiling as our example to demonstrate how these topological
boundary floppy modes arise with a small geometric perturbation to the tiling.
The same construction can also be applied to disordered parallelogram tilings
to generate topological boundary floppy modes. We prove the existence of these
topological boundary floppy modes using a duality theorem which relates floppy
modes and states of self stress in parallelogram tilings and fiber networks,
which are Maxwell reciprocal diagrams to one another. We find that, due to the
unusual rotational symmetry of quasicrystals, the resulting topological
polarization can exhibit orientations not allowed in periodic lattices. Our
result reveals new physics about the interplay between topological states and
quasicrystalline order, and leads to novel designs of quasicrystalline

critical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the DE beam

the interception of the beam with satellites by using their orbital parameters
and computing the likelihood of interception for many of the scenarios of the
proposed systems we are working on. We are able to simulate both the absolute
interception as well as the distance and angle from the beam to the spacecraft,
and have modeled a number of scenarios to obtain general probabilities. We have
established that the probability of beam interception of any active satellite,
including its orbital position uncertainty, during any of the proposed mission
scenarios is low ($\approx10^{-4}$). The outcome of this work gives us the
ability to predict when to energize the beam without intercept, as well as the
capability to turn off the DE as needed for extended mission scenarios. As
additional satellites are launched, our work can be readily extended to
accommodate them. Our work can also be used to predict interception of
astronomical adaptive optics guide-star lasers as well as more general laser

that derived for the same mass range from global estimates --averaged over the

adopted. However, when considering the error in this age estimate (+160 -100
Myr), a definitive conclusion on this issue cannot be reached yet. The lower
limit of 690Myr (closer to the classical Hyades age of 600-650Myr) would

growth of the straight capillary is found to control the onset of a bifurcation
towards a tortuous shape. The post-buckling morphology is studied using a mixed

highlights how the geometrical and the elastic properties of the capillary and
the surrounding medium concur to trigger the loss of marginal stability of the
straight capillary and the nonlinear development of its spatial tortuosity.

obtained using the nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight-binding

attributed to bound states in continuum (BSCs). The BSC lifetime is determined
by both hopping parameters between subsystems and the SC-wire properties. It is
established that the FR width and position are extremely sensitive to the type
of the lowest-energy excitation in the SC wire, the Majorana or Andreev bound
state (MBS or ABS, respectively). Moreover, it is shown that in the specific
case of the AB ring, the T-shape geometry, the FR disappears for the transport
via the MBS and the conductance is equal to one quantum. It doubles in the
local transport regime. On the contrary, in the ABS case the local conductance
vanishes. The influence of the mean-field Coulomb interactions and diagonal
disorder in the SC wire on the FR is investigated.

Although in cases with some continuous spatial symmetry flux functions can
always be found for vacuum magnetic fields, an analogous function does not, in
general, exist in three dimensions. This work examines several simple
equilibria and vacuum magnetic field problems with the intent of demonstrating
the possibilities and limitations in the construction of such states. Starting
with a simple vacuum magnetic field with closed field lines in a topological

stellarator symmetry in the amplitude expansion of the full ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem as well. We then investigate the conditions
that guarantee neighboring flux surfaces given the data on one surface, by
expanding in the distance from that surface. We show that it is much more
difficult to find low shear vacuum fields with surfaces than force-free fields

linear codes for which the value of each coordinate can be recovered by a
linear combination of at most r other coordinates. In this paper, we are
interested to find the largest possible minimum distance of (n,k,r)-LRCs,
denoted D(n,k,r). We refer to the problem of finding the value of D(n,k,r) as
the largest minimum distance (LMD) problem. LMD can be approximated within an
additive term of one; it is known in the literature that D(n,k,r) is either
equal to d* or d*-1, where d*=n-k-ceil(k/r) +2. Also, in the literature, LMD
has been solved for some ranges of code parameters n, k and r. However, LMD is
still unsolved for the general code parameters.
  In this work, we convert LMD to a simply stated problem in graph theory, and
prove that the two problems are equivalent. In fact, we show that solving the
derived graph theory problem not only solves LMD, but also directly translates
to construction of optimal LRCs. Using these new results, we show how to easily
derive the existing results on LMD and extend them. Furthermore, we show a
close connection between LMD and a challenging open problem in extremal graph
theory; an indication that LMD is perhaps difficult to solve for general code

  Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs","This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transaction of Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a tunable measure for information leakage called maximal
alpha-leakage. This measure quantifies the maximal gain of an adversary in
inferring any (potentially random) function of a dataset from a release of the
data. The inferential capability of the adversary is, in turn, quantified by a
class of adversarial loss functions that we introduce as $\alpha$-loss,
$\alpha\in[1,\infty]$. The choice of $\alpha$ determines the specific
adversarial action and ranges from refining a belief (about any function of the
data) for $\alpha=1$ to guessing the most likely value for $\alpha=\infty$
while refining the $\alpha^{th}$ moment of the belief for $\alpha$ in between.
Maximal alpha-leakage then quantifies the adversarial gain under $\alpha$-loss
over all possible functions of the data. In particular, for the extremal values
of $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=\infty$, maximal alpha-leakage simplifies to mutual
information and maximal leakage, respectively. For $\alpha\in(1,\infty)$ this
measure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity of order $\alpha$. We show
that maximal alpha-leakage satisfies data processing inequalities and a
sub-additivity property thereby allowing for a weak composition result.
Building upon these properties, we use maximal alpha-leakage as the privacy
measure and study the problem of data publishing with privacy guarantees,
wherein the utility of the released data is ensured via a hard distortion
constraint. Unlike average distortion, hard distortion provides a deterministic
guarantee of fidelity. We show that under a hard distortion constraint, for
$\alpha>1$ the optimal mechanism is independent of $\alpha$, and therefore, the
resulting optimal tradeoff is the same for all values of $\alpha>1$. Finally,
the tunability of maximal alpha-leakage as a privacy measure is also
illustrated for binary data with average Hamming distortion as the utility
measure.

If $G$ is $q$-Ramsey for $H$, yet no proper subgraph of $G$ has this property
then $G$ is called $q$-Ramsey-minimal for $H$. Generalising a statement by
Burr, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\""odl from 1977 we prove that, for $q\ge 3$, if $G$
is a graph that is not $q$-Ramsey for some graph $H$ then $G$ is contained as
an induced subgraph in an infinite number of $q$-Ramsey-minimal graphs for $H$,
as long as $H$ is $3$-connected or isomorphic to the triangle. For such $H$,
the following are some consequences.
  (1) For $2\le r< q$, every $r$-Ramsey-minimal graph for $H$ is contained as
an induced subgraph in an infinite number of $q$-Ramsey-minimal graphs for $H$.
  (2) For every $q\ge 3$, there are $q$-Ramsey-minimal graphs for $H$ of
arbitrarily large maximum degree, genus, and chromatic number.
  (3) The collection $\{{\cal M}_q(H) : H \text{ is 3-connected or } K_3\}$
forms an antichain with respect to the subset relation, where ${\cal M}_q(H)$
denotes the set of all graphs that are $q$-Ramsey-minimal for $H$.
  We also address the question which pairs of graphs satisfy ${\cal
M}_q(H_1)={\cal M}_q(H_2)$, in which case $H_1$ and $H_2$ are called
$q$-equivalent. We show that two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ are $q$-equivalent for
even $q$ if they are $2$-equivalent, and that in general $q$-equivalence for
some $q\ge 3$ does not necessarily imply $2$-equivalence. Finally we indicate
that for connected graphs this implication may hold: Results by
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\""odl and by Fox, Grinshpun, Liebenau, Person and Szab\'o

factored representation of the matrix variable and employ an $\ell_1$-loss
function to robustify the solution against outliers. We show that even when a
constant fraction (which can be up to almost half) of the measurements are

the measurement model satisfy the so-called $\ell_1/\ell_2$-restricted isometry
property, the ground-truth matrix can be exactly recovered from any global
minimum of the resulting optimization problem. Furthermore, we show that the
objective function of the optimization problem is sharp and weakly convex.
Consequently, a subgradient Method (SubGM) with geometrically diminishing step
sizes will converge linearly to the ground-truth matrix when suitably
initialized. We demonstrate the efficacy of the SubGM for the nonconvex robust

on constrained spaces. Such data are commonly found in spatial applications,
such as climatology and criminology, where measurements are restricted to a
geographical area. Other settings include domains where unsuitable recordings
are discarded, such as flow-cytometry measurements. A simple approach to
modeling such data is through the use of mixture models, especially
nonparametric mixture models. Mixture models, while flexible and theoretically
well-understood, are unsuitable for settings involving complicated constraints,
leading to difficulties in specifying the component distributions and in
evaluating normalization constants. Bayesian inference over the parameters of
these models results in posterior distributions that are doubly-intractable. We
address this problem via an algorithm based on rejection sampling and data
augmentation. We view samples from a truncated distribution as outcomes of a
rejection sampling scheme, where proposals are made from a simple mixture model
and are rejected if they violate the constraints. Our scheme proceeds by
imputing the rejected samples given mixture parameters and then resampling
parameters given all samples. We study two modeling approaches: mixtures of
truncated Gaussians and truncated mixtures of Gaussians, along with their
associated Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. We also discuss
variations of the models, as well as approximations to improve mixing, reduce
computational cost, and lower variance. We present results on simulated data

has specified these scaling functions (there is one for the critical point

Painlev\'e V equation. For the diagonal-diagonal correlation, we characterise
the first two leading large $N$ correction terms to the scaling functions ---
these occur at orders $N^{-1}$ and $N^{-2}$ --- in terms of solutions of a
second order linear differential equation with coefficients given in terms of
these transcendents, and show how they can be computed. We show that the order
$N^{-1}$ is trivial and can be eliminated through appropriate variables so that
the leading non-trivial correction is of order $N^{-2}$. In this respect our
result gives precise and full characterisation of claims made in the earlier

field and the network of strings and domain walls until the density contrast is
frozen. Our simulations, comprising up to $8192^3$ points, are the largest
studies of the axion field evolution in the non-linear regime presented so far.
Axitons, pseudo-breathers of the Klein-Gordon equation, are observed to form in
our simulation at late times. Studying their properties analytically and
numerically, we observe that in particular, the earliest axitons contribute to
density perturbations at the typical length scale of miniclusters. We analyse
the small scale structure of the density field, giving the correlation length,
power spectrum and the distribution of high-density regions that will collapse
into axion miniclusters. The final density field of our simulations can be used
to calculate the minicluster mass fraction in simulations including gravity. In
particular, we find that typical minicluster progenitors are smaller than
previously thought and only of moderate, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ overdensity. We
expect these miniclusters to have a rich sub-structure, emerging from
small-scale fluctuations produced in the collapse of the string-wall network

We enumerate two main causes of bias, sampling bias and label bias, and we

region with boundaries --the bulk theory--, or as a theory defined on the
boundary of the region --the boundary theory--. In our case the bulk theory is
given by the 4-dimensional $U(1)$ Pontryagin action and the boundary one is
defined by the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action. We analyse the conditions that need
to be imposed on the bulk theory so that the total Hamiltonian, smeared

the interplay between the constraints and boundary conditions in the bulk

different canonical variables and constraint structure, by explicitly showing
that they both have the same symmetries, degrees of freedom and observables.

interpolation are required to implement image processing algorithms on quantum

interpolation of NEQR encoded images based on Clifford+T gates. Quantum
circuits for the scale up operation and scale down operation are illustrated.
The proposed quantum circuits are based on quantum Clifford+T gates and are
optimized for T-count. Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T gates can be made
fault tolerant but the T gate is very costly to implement. As a result,
reducing T-count is an important optimization goal. The proposed quantum
bilinear interpolation circuits are based on (i) a quantum adder, (ii) a
proposed quantum subtractor, and (iii) a quantum multiplication circuit.
Further, both designs are compared and shown to be superior to existing work in
terms of T-count. The proposed quantum bilinear interpolation circuits for the
scale down operation and for the scale up operation each have a $92.52\%$
improvement in terms of T-count compared to the existing work.

parameters and abundance determination by applying non-solar-scaled opacities
and model atmospheres. Our sample is composed by 20 stars including
main-sequence and evolved objects. Opacities for an arbitrary composition and
vmicro were calculated through the Opacity Sampling method. We obtained a small
difference in stellar parameters derived with non-solar-scaled opacities
compared to classical solar-scaled models. The differences in Teff, log g and
[Fe/H] amount up to 26 K, 0.05 dex and 0.020 dex for the stars in our sample.
These differences could be considered as the first estimation of the error due
to the use of classical solar-scaled opacities to derive stellar parameters
with solar-type and evolved stars. Some chemical species could also show an
individual variation higher than those of the [Fe/H] (up to 0.03 dex) and
varying from one specie to another, obtaining a chemical pattern difference
between both methods. This means that condensation temperature Tc trends could
also present a variation. We include an example showing that using
non-solar-scaled opacities, the classical solution cannot always verify the
excitation and ionization balance conditions required for a model atmosphere.
We consider that the use of the non-solar-scaled opacities is not mandatory in
every statistical study with large samples of stars. However, for those
high-precision works whose results depend on the mutual comparison of different
chemical species (such as Tc trends), we consider that it is worthwhile its
application. To date, this is probably one of the more precise spectroscopic

measurements of galaxy clustering and cross-correlations of galaxy positions
and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps. We use a simple Gaussian
model for a redshift distribution in a redshift bin with two parameters: the
mean, $z_0$, and the width, $\sigma_z$. We vary these parameters, as well as a
galaxy bias parameter, $b_{\text{g}}$, and a matter fluctuations parameter,
$\sigma_8$, for each redshift bin, as well as the parameter
$\Omega_{\text{m}}$, in a Fisher analysis across 12 redshift bins from $z=0-7$.
We find that incorporating redshift uncertainties degrades constraints on
$\sigma_8(z)$ in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)/CMB-S4 era by about
a factor of 10 compared to the case of perfect redshift knowledge. In our
fiducial analysis of LSST/CMB-S4 including redshift uncertainties, we project
constraints on $\sigma_8(z)$ for $z<3$ of less than $5 \%$. Galaxy imaging
surveys are expected to have priors on redshift parameters from photometric
redshift algorithms and other methods. When adding priors with the expected
precision for LSST redshift algorithms, the constraints on $\sigma_8(z)$ can be
improved by a factor of 2-3 compared to the case of no prior information. We
also find that `self-calibrated' constraints on the redshift parameters from
just the autocorrelation and cross-correlation measurements (with no prior
information) are competitive with photometric redshift techniques. In the
LSST/CMB-S4 era, we find uncertainty on the redshift parameters
($z_0,\sigma_z$) to be below 0.004(1+z) at $z<1$. For all parameters,
constraints improve significantly if smaller scales can be used. We also
project constraints for nearer term survey combinations, Dark Energy Survey

are added to input that is correctly classified. The perturbations yield
adversarial examples, which are virtually indistinguishable from the

for deep learning, attackers can craft adversarial examples from most input to
cause a misclassification of their choice.
  We introduce a new type of network units, called RBFI units, whose non-linear
structure makes them inherently resistant to adversarial attacks. On
permutation-invariant MNIST, in absence of adversarial attacks, networks using
RBFI units match the performance of networks using sigmoid units, and are
slightly below the accuracy of networks with ReLU units. When subjected to
adversarial attacks, networks with RBFI units retain accuracies above 90% for
attacks that degrade the accuracy of networks with ReLU or sigmoid units to
below 2%. RBFI networks trained with regular input are superior in their
resistance to adversarial attacks even to ReLU and sigmoid networks trained
with the help of adversarial examples.
  The non-linear structure of RBFI units makes them difficult to train using
standard gradient descent. We show that networks of RBFI units can be
efficiently trained to high accuracies using pseudogradients, computed using
functions especially crafted to facilitate learning instead of their true
derivatives. We show that the use of pseudogradients makes training deep RBFI

single-photon qubits succeed with probability $p_s$ no higher than $0.5$.
However pre-detection quadrature squeezing, i.e., quantum noise limited phase
sensitive amplification, in the usual linear-optical BSM circuit, can yield
${p_s \approx 0.643}$. The ability to achieve $p_s > 0.5$ has been found to be
critical in resource-efficient realizations of linear optical quantum computing
and all-photonic quantum repeaters. Yet, the aforesaid value of $p_s > 0.5$ is
not known to be the maximum achievable using squeezing, thereby leaving it open
whether close-to-$100\%$ efficient BSM might be achievable using squeezing as a
resource. In this paper, we report new insights on why squeezing-enhanced BSM
achieves $p_s > 0.5$. Using this, we show that the previously-reported ${p_s
\approx 0.643}$ at single-mode squeezing strength $r=0.6585$---for unambiguous
state discrimination (USD) of all four Bell states---is an experimentally
unachievable point result, which drops to $p_s \approx 0.59$ with the slightest
change in $r$. We however show that squeezing-induced boosting of $p_s$ with
USD operation is still possible over a continuous range of $r$, with an
experimentally achievable maximum occurring at $r=0.5774$, achieving ${p_s
\approx 0.596}$. Finally, deviating from USD operation, we explore a
trade-space between $p_s$, the probability with which the BSM circuit declares
a ""success"", versus the probability of error $p_e$, the probability of an input
Bell state being erroneously identified given the circuit declares a success.
Since quantum error correction could correct for some $p_e > 0$, this tradeoff
may enable better quantum repeater designs by potentially increasing the
entanglement generation rates with $p_s$ exceeding what is possible with
traditionally-studied USD operation of BSMs.

practical issues from financial regulation, special attention is given to the
two most widely used risk measures in the industry, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and
Expected Shortfall (ES). We establish that for a class of general optimization
problems, VaR leads to non-robust optimizers whereas convex risk measures
generally lead to robust ones. Our results offer extra insight on the ongoing
discussion about the comparative advantages of VaR and ES in banking and

the field of robust optimization, to which some interesting links are derived.

heat transfer of conforming rough surfaces is theoretically re-estimated

fluctuational electrodynamics (an ab initio calculation) is adopted to
calculate the thermal radiation. The contribution of contact regions is
estimated by the CMY TCR model and further studied by modelling specific

out-of-plane magnetic field. Historically, studies of the Hall effect have led
to major breakthroughs including the discoveries of Berry curvature and the
topological Chern invariants. In magnets, the internal magnetization allows
Hall conductivity in the absence of external magnetic field. This anomalous
Hall effect (AHE) has become an important tool to study quantum magnets. In
nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic fields, the electrical Hall
effect is rarely explored because of the constraint by time-reversal symmetry.
However, strictly speaking, only the Hall effect in the linear response regime,
i.e., the Hall voltage linearly proportional to the external electric field,
identically vanishes due to time-reversal symmetry. The Hall effect in the
nonlinear response regime, on the other hand, may not be subject to such
symmetry constraints. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear Hall
effect (NLHE) in the electrical transport of the nonmagnetic 2D quantum
material, bilayer WTe2. Specifically, flowing an electrical current in bilayer
WTe2 leads to a nonlinear Hall voltage in the absence of magnetic field. The
NLHE exhibits unusual properties sharply distinct from the AHE in metals: The
NLHE shows a quadratic I-V characteristic; It strongly dominates the nonlinear
longitudinal response, leading to a Hall angle of about 90 degree. We further
show that the NLHE directly measures the ""dipole moment"" of the Berry
curvature, which arises from layer-polarized Dirac fermions in bilayer WTe2.
Our results demonstrate a new Hall effect and provide a powerful methodology to
detect Berry curvature in a wide range of nonmagnetic quantum materials in an
energy-resolved way.

isotropic and anisotropic dis- persion. For the anisotropic dispersion, the
RKKY interaction is also anisotropic and related to the lattice parameters
which can be obtained throuh the DFT calculation or the experiments. The
fearures of the RKKY interaction also can be treated as a signature of the
topological phase transition as well as the change of Berry curvature. Our

human activity is necessary for their well-being. However, measurement of force
exertion levels is challenging and the existing techniques pose a great
challenge as they are either intrusive, interfere with human-machine interface,
and/or subjective in the nature, thus are not scalable for all workers. In this
work, we use face videos and the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to classify
force exertion levels of 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% (representing rest, moderate
effort, and high effort), thus providing a non-intrusive and scalable approach.
Efficient feature extraction approaches have been investigated, including
standard deviation of the movement of different landmarks of the face,
distances between peaks and troughs in the PPG signals. We note that the PPG
signals can be obtained from the face videos, thus giving an efficient
classification algorithm for the force exertion levels using face videos. Based
on the data collected from 20 subjects, features extracted from the face videos
give 90\% accuracy in classification among the 100\% and the combination of 0\%

The approach is also shown to be robust to the correctly identify force level

that adopting pre-trained models from classification to detection task may
incur learning bias due to the different objective function and diverse
distributions of object categories. Techniques like fine-tuning on detection
task could alleviate this issue to some extent but are still not fundamental.
Furthermore, transferring these pre-trained models across discrepant domains
will be more difficult (e.g., from RGB to depth images). Thus, a better
solution to handle these critical problems is to train object detectors from
scratch, which motivates our proposed method. Previous efforts on this
direction mainly failed by reasons of the limited training data and naive
backbone network structures for object detection. In DSOD, we contribute a set
of design principles for learning object detectors from scratch. One of the key
principles is the deep supervision, enabled by layer-wise dense connections in
both backbone networks and prediction layers, plays a critical role in learning
good detectors from scratch. After involving several other principles, we build
our DSOD based on the single-shot detection framework (SSD). We evaluate our
method on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and COCO datasets. DSOD achieves consistently
better results than the state-of-the-art methods with much more compact models.
Specifically, DSOD outperforms baseline method SSD on all three benchmarks,

important progress towards this goal has been achieved by simply sharing the

unable to make full use of the fact that detection and segmentation are
mutually beneficial. To overcome this drawback, we propose a framework called
TripleNet where triple supervisions including detection-oriented supervision,
class-aware segmentation supervision, and class-agnostic segmentation
supervision are imposed on each layer of the decoder network. Class-agnostic
segmentation supervision provides an objectness prior knowledge for both
semantic segmentation and object detection. Besides the three types of
supervisions, two light-weight modules (i.e., inner-connected module and
attention skip-layer fusion) are also incorporated into each layer of the
decoder. In the proposed framework, detection and segmentation can sufficiently
boost each other. Moreover, class-agnostic and class-aware segmentation on each
decoder layer are not performed at the test stage. Therefore, no extra
computational costs are introduced at the test stage. Experimental results on
the VOC2007 and VOC2012 datasets demonstrate that the proposed TripleNet is
able to improve both the detection and segmentation accuracies without adding

continuum observation in a 343 arcmin$^2$ area of the northeast region in the
Small Magellanic Cloud at a wavelength of 1.1 mm, conducted using the AzTEC

objects by contouring $10\sigma$ emission. Through spectral energy distribution
(SED) analysis using 1.1 mm, $Herschel$, and $Spitzer$ data, we estimated the
gas masses of $5\times 10^3-7\times 10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, assuming a
gas-to-dust ratio of 1000. Dust temperature and the index of emissivity were
also estimated as $18-33$ K and $0.9-1.9$, respectively, which are consistent
with previous low resolution studies. The relation between dust temperature and
the index of emissivity shows a weak negative linear correlation. We also
investigated five CO-detected dust-selected clouds in detail. The total gas
masses were comparable to those estimated from the Mopra CO data, indicating
that the assumed gas-to-dust ratio of 1000 and the $X_\mathrm{CO}$ factor of
$1\times10^{21}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}~(K~km~s^{-1})^{-1}}$, with uncertainties of a
factor of 2, are reliable for the estimation of the gas masses of molecular or
dust-selected clouds. Dust column density showed good spatial correlation with
CO emission, except for an object that associates with bright young stellar
objects. The $8~\mathrm{\mu m}$ filamentary and clumpy structures also showed
similar spatial distribution with the CO emission and dust column density,
supporting the fact that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions arise from
the surfaces of dense gas and dust clouds.

and correlation, are known to be relevant to the performance and
interpretability of deep learning. When a statistical characteristic is
desired, often an adequate regularizer can be designed and applied during the
training phase. Typically, such a regularizer aims to manipulate a statistical
characteristic over all classes together. For classification tasks, however, it
might be advantageous to enforce the desired characteristic per class such that
different classes can be better distinguished. Motivated by the idea, we design
two class-wise regularizers that explicitly utilize class information:
class-wise Covariance Regularizer (cw-CR) and class-wise Variance Regularizer
(cw-VR). cw-CR targets to reduce the covariance of representations calculated
from the same class samples for encouraging feature independence. cw-VR is
similar, but variance instead of covariance is targeted to improve feature
compactness. For the sake of completeness, their counterparts without using
class information, Covariance Regularizer (CR) and Variance Regularizer (VR),
are considered together. The four regularizers are conceptually simple and
computationally very efficient, and the visualization shows that the
regularizers indeed perform distinct representation shaping. In terms of
classification performance, significant improvements over the baseline and
L1/L2 weight regularization methods were found for 21 out of 22 tasks over
popular benchmark datasets. In particular, cw-VR achieved the best performance
for 13 tasks including ResNet-32/110.

Specifically, we consider the problems of training a perception system to

debugging failures. We show how a probabilistic programming language can help
address these problems by specifying distributions encoding interesting types
of inputs and sampling these to generate specialized training and test sets.
More generally, such languages can be used for cyber-physical systems and
robotics to write environment models, an essential prerequisite to any formal
analysis. In this paper, we focus on systems like autonomous cars and robots,
whose environment is a ""scene"", a configuration of physical objects and agents.
We design a domain-specific language, Scenic, for describing ""scenarios"" that
are distributions over scenes. As a probabilistic programming language, Scenic
allows assigning distributions to features of the scene, as well as
declaratively imposing hard and soft constraints over the scene. We develop
specialized techniques for sampling from the resulting distribution, taking
advantage of the structure provided by Scenic's domain-specific syntax.
Finally, we apply Scenic in a case study on a convolutional neural network
designed to detect cars in road images, improving its performance beyond that
achieved by state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods.

attention mechanism that has been found to be a powerful representation
learning technique in speaker recognition. In this framework, an attention
model works as a frame selector that computes an attention weight for each
frame-level feature vector, in accord with which an utterancelevel
representation is produced at the pooling layer in a speaker embedding network.
In general, an attention model is trained together with the speaker embedding
network on a single objective function, and thus those two components are
tightly bound to one another. In this paper, we consider the possibility that
the attention model might be decoupled from its parent network and assist other
speaker embedding networks and even conventional i-vector extractors. This
possibility is demonstrated through a series of experiments on a NIST Speaker
Recognition Evaluation (SRE) task, with 9.0% EER reduction and 3.8%
min_Cprimary reduction when the attention weights are applied to i-vector
extraction. Another experiment shows that DNN-based soft voice activity
detection (VAD) can be effectively combined with the attention mechanism to
yield further reduction of minCprimary by 6.6% and 1.6% in deep speaker
embedding and i-vector systems, respectively.

to share their everyday photos and events on social media platforms, such as
Facebook, Instagram, and WeChat. In social media data mining, post popularity
prediction has received much attention from both data scientists and
psychologists. Existing research focuses more on exploring the post popularity
on a population of users and including comprehensive factors such as temporal
information, user connections, number of comments, and so on. However, these
frameworks are not suitable for guiding a specific user to make a popular post
because the attributes of this user are fixed. Therefore, previous frameworks
can only answer the question ""whether a post is popular"" rather than ""how to
become famous by popular posts"". In this paper, we aim at predicting the
popularity of a post for a specific user and mining the patterns behind the
popularity. To this end, we first collect data from Instagram. We then design a
method to figure out the user environment, representing the content that a
specific user is very likely to post. Based on the relevant data, we devise a
novel dual-attention model to incorporate image, caption, and user environment.
The dual-attention model basically consists of two parts, explicit attention
for image-caption pairs and implicit attention for user environment. A
hierarchical structure is devised to concatenate the explicit attention part
and implicit attention part. We conduct a series of experiments to validate the
effectiveness of our model and investigate the factors that can influence the
popularity. The classification results show that our model outperforms the
baselines, and a statistical analysis identifies what kind of pictures or

critical temperature, which also exhibits a pronounced peak near the

Examples of such tasks, such as goal-directed navigation and pick-and-place in

for such tasks: model-free or model-based. Each of these approaches has
limitations. Model-free RL struggles to transfer learned information when the
goal location changes, but achieves high asymptotic accuracy in single goal
tasks. Model-based RL can transfer learned information to new goal locations by
retaining the explicitly learned state-dynamics, but is limited by the fact
that small errors in modelling these dynamics accumulate over long-term
planning. In this work, we improve upon the limitations of model-free RL in
multi-goal domains. We do this by adapting the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for RL
and call the adaptation Floyd-Warshall RL (FWRL). The proposed algorithm learns
a goal-conditioned action-value function by constraining the value of the
optimal path between any two states to be greater than or equal to the value of
paths via intermediary states. Experimentally, we show that FWRL is more
sample-efficient and learns higher reward strategies in multi-goal tasks as
compared to Q-learning, model-based RL and other relevant baselines in a
tabular domain.

factors (e.g. 4x, 8x) based on examples of pristine high-resolution images. Our
target is to reconstruct high-resolution images from their downscale versions.
The proposed system performs a multi-level progressive upscaling, starting from
small factors (2x) and updating for higher factors (4x and 8x). The system is
recursive as it repeats the same procedure at each level. It is also residual
since we use the network to update the outputs of a classic upscaler. The
network residuals are improved by Iterative Back-Projections (IBP) computed in
the features of a convolutional network. To work in multiple levels we extend
the standard back-projection algorithm using a recursion analogous to
Multi-Grid algorithms commonly used as solvers of large systems of linear
equations. We finally show how the network can be interpreted as a standard
upsampling-and-filter upscaler with a space-variant filter that adapts to the
geometry. This approach allows us to visualize how the network learns to
upscale. Finally, our system reaches state of the art quality for models with
relatively few number of parameters.

low-frequency telescopes, such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; the
precursor for the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array) offers
an opportunity to probe the physics of radio sources at very low radio
frequencies. In this paper, we present a catalogue of linearly-polarised
sources detected at 216 MHz, using data from the Galactic and Extragalactic
All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey. Our catalogue covers the Declination range
$-17^{\circ}$ to $-37^{\circ}$ and 24 hours in Right Ascension, at a resolution
of around 3 arcminutes. We detect 81 sources (including both a known pulsar and
new pulsar candidate) with linearly-polarised flux densities in excess of 18
mJy across a survey area of approximately 6400 square degrees, corresponding to
a surface density of 1 source per 79 square degrees. The level of Faraday
rotation measured for our sources is broadly consistent with those recovered at
higher frequencies, with typically more than an order of magnitude improvement
in the uncertainty compared to higher-frequency measurements. However, our
catalogue is likely incomplete at low Faraday rotation measures, due to our
practice of excluding sources in the region where instrumental leakage appears.
The majority of sources exhibit significant depolarisation compared to higher
frequencies; however, a small sub-sample repolarise at 216 MHz. We also discuss
the polarisation properties of four nearby, large-angular-scale radio galaxies,
with a particular focus on the giant radio galaxy ESO 422$-$G028, in order to
explain the striking differences in polarised morphology between 216 MHz and
1.4 GHz.

applications such as image retrieval and network compression. Nevertheless,
existing approaches could hardly guarantee a satisfactory performance with the
extremely low-bit (e.g., 4-bit) hash codes due to the severe information loss
and the shrink of the discrete solution space. In this paper, we propose a
novel \textit{Collaborative Learning} strategy that is tailored for generating
high-quality low-bit hash codes. The core idea is to jointly distill
bit-specific and informative representations for a group of pre-defined code
lengths. The learning of short hash codes among the group can benefit from the
manifold shared with other long codes, where multiple views from different hash
codes provide the supplementary guidance and regularization, making the
convergence faster and more stable. To achieve that, an asymmetric hashing
framework with two variants of multi-head embedding structures is derived,
termed as Multi-head Asymmetric Hashing (MAH), leading to great efficiency of
training and querying. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have
been conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed MAH, and have shown
that the 8-bit hash codes generated by MAH achieve $94.3\%$ of the MAP (Mean
Average Precision (MAP)) score on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which significantly
surpasses the performance of the 48-bit codes by the state-of-the-arts in image

byte-addressability, low idle power, and improved memory-density, and are
likely to be a key component in the future memory hierarchy. However, a
critical challenge in achieving high performance is in accounting for the
asymmetry that NVRAM writes can be significantly more expensive than NVRAM
reads.
  In this paper, we consider a large class of cache-oblivious algorithms for
dynamic programming (DP) and linear algebra, and try to reduce the writes in
the asymmetric setting while maintaining high parallelism. To achieve that, our
key approach is to show the correspondence between these problems and an
abstraction for their computation, which is referred to as the $k$-d grids.
Then by showing lower bound and new algorithms for computing $k$-d grids, we
show a list of improved cache-oblivious algorithms of many DP recurrences and
in linear algebra in the asymmetric setting, both sequentially and in parallel.
  Surprisingly, even without considering the read-write asymmetry (i.e.,
setting the write cost to be the same as the read cost in the algorithms), the
new algorithms improve the existing cache complexity of many problems. We
believe the reason is that the extra level of abstraction of $k$-d grids helps
us to better understand the complexity and difficulties of these problems. We
believe that the novelty of our framework is of interests and leads to many new
questions for future work.

from classification to AI. Learning corresponds to fitting training data, which
is implemented by descending a very high-dimensional loss function.
Understanding under which conditions neural networks do not get stuck in poor
minima of the loss, and how the landscape of that loss evolves as depth is
increased remains a challenge. Here we predict, and test empirically, an
analogy between this landscape and the energy landscape of repulsive ellipses.
We argue that in FC networks a phase transition delimits the over- and
under-parametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. In the
vicinity of this transition, properties of the curvature of the minima of the
loss are critical. This transition shares direct similarities with the jamming
transition by which particles form a disordered solid as the density is
increased, which also occurs in certain classes of computational optimization
and learning problems such as the perceptron. Our analysis gives a simple
explanation as to why poor minima of the loss cannot be encountered in the
overparametrized regime, and puts forward the surprising result that the
ability of fully connected networks to fit random data is independent of their
depth. Our observations suggests that this independence also holds for real
data. We also study a quantity $\Delta$ which characterizes how well
($\Delta<0$) or badly ($\Delta>0$) a datum is learned. At the critical point it
is power-law distributed, $P_+(\Delta)\sim\Delta^\theta$ for $\Delta>0$ and
$P_-(\Delta)\sim(-\Delta)^{-\gamma}$ for $\Delta<0$, with $\theta\approx0.3$
and $\gamma\approx0.2$. This observation suggests that near the transition the
loss landscape has a hierarchical structure and that the learning dynamics is
prone to avalanche-like dynamics, with abrupt changes in the set of patterns
that are learned.

coordinates are updated in each iteration, our method reduces to the classical
accelerated gradient descent method AGD of Nesterov. If a single coordinate is

  While mini-batch variants of ACD are more popular and relevant in practice,
there is no importance sampling for ACD that outperforms the standard uniform
mini-batch sampling. Through insights enabled by our general analysis, we
design new importance sampling for mini-batch ACD which significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art minibatch ACD in practice. We prove a
rate that is at most ${\cal O}(\sqrt{\tau})$ times worse than the rate of
minibatch ACD with uniform sampling, but can be ${\cal O}(n/\tau)$ times
better, where $\tau$ is the minibatch size. Since in modern supervised learning
training systems it is standard practice to choose $\tau \ll n$, and often
$\tau={\cal O}(1)$, our method can lead to dramatic speedups. Lastly, we obtain
similar results for minibatch nonaccelerated CD as well, achieving improvements

Together with two other sources found earlier, they constitute a new type of
fast transients which cannot be attributed to neutron stars but might be due to
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; 10^{2-4} M_sun). The flaring behavior is
recurrent for at least two sources. If the flare represents a short period of
accretion onto an IMBH during the periastron passage of a donor star on an
eccentric (i.e., repeating) or parabolic (non-repeating) orbit, we argue that
the flare's rise time corresponds to the duration during which the donor's
tidally stripped mass joins a residual disk at the pericenter. This duration is
in turn equal to three other time scales: the duration of stripping, the sound
crossing time of the donor, and the circular orbit time at the pericenter
radius. Only a white dwarf can have a sound crossing time as short as one
minute. Therefore, the donor must be a white dwarf and it was stripped of
~10^{-10} M_sun upon each passage at several to tens of Schwarzschild radii
from the IMBH. The flux decay corresponds to the viscous drainage of the
supplied mass toward the hole. Aided with long-term X-ray monitoring, this type
of fast transients would be an ideal target for next-generation gravitational
wave detectors.

beam charging (RBC) can transmit Watt-level power over long distance for the
devices in the internet of things (IoT). Due to its open-loop architecture, RBC
faces the challenge of providing dynamic current and voltage to optimize
battery charging performance. In RBC, battery overcharge may cause energy
waste, thermal effects, and even safety issues. On the other hand, battery
undercharge may lead to charging time extension and significant battery
capacity reduction. In this paper, we present an adaptive resonant beam
charging (ARBC) system for battery charging optimization. Based on RBC, ARBC
uses a feedback system to control the supplied power dynamically according to
the battery preferred charging values. Moreover, in order to transform the
received current and voltage to match the battery preferred charging values,
ARBC adopts a direct current to direct current (DC-DC) conversion circuit.
Relying on the analytical models for RBC power transmission, we obtain the
end-to-end power transfer relationship in the approximate linear closed-form of
ARBC. Thus, the battery preferred charging power at the receiver can be mapped
to the supplied power at the transmitter for feedback control. Numerical
evaluation demonstrates that ARBC can save 61% battery charging energy and
53%-60% supplied energy compared with RBC. Furthermore, ARBC has high
energy-saving gain over RBC when the WPT is unefficient. ARBC in WPT is similar
to link adaption in wireless communications. Both of them play the important
roles in their respective areas.

the three-dimensional phase space distribution shows a clear cluster mass

haloes by projecting the three-dimensional phase space distribution along the
line-of-sight with the effect of the Hubble flow. We find that this projected

shows a complex mass dependence due to the interplay between infall velocities
and the Hubble flow. Using this model, we estimate the accuracy of dynamical
mass measurements from the projected phase space distribution at the transverse
distance from cluster centres larger than $2h^{-1}$Mpc. We estimate that, by
using $1.5\times 10^5$ spectroscopic galaxies, we can constrain the mean
cluster masses with an accuracy of 14.5\% if we fully take account of the
systematic error coming from the inaccuracy of our model. This can be improved
down to 5.7\% by improving the accuracy of the model.

  for Signal Recovery and Network Reconstruction","44 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a Bayesian method for feature selection in the presence of
grouping information with sparsity on the between- and within group level.
Instead of using a stochastic algorithm for parameter inference, we employ
expectation propagation, which is a deterministic and fast algorithm. Available
methods for feature selection in the presence of grouping information have a
number of short-comings: on one hand, lasso methods, while being fast,
underestimate the regression coefficients and do not make good use of the
grouping information, and on the other hand, Bayesian approaches, while
accurate in parameter estimation, often rely on the stochastic and slow Gibbs
sampling procedure to recover the parameters, rendering them infeasible e.g.
for gene network reconstruction. Our approach of a Bayesian sparse-group
framework with expectation propagation enables us to not only recover accurate
parameter estimates in signal recovery problems, but also makes it possible to
apply this Bayesian framework to large-scale network reconstruction problems.
The presented method is generic but in terms of application we focus on gene
regulatory networks. We show on simulated and experimental data that the method
constitutes a good choice for network reconstruction regarding the number of
correctly selected features, prediction on new data and reasonable computing
time.

matching of line segments for challenging stereo streams with severe
illumination changes or High Dynamic Range (HDR) environments. To that purpose,
we exploit the univocal nature of the matching problem, i.e. every observation
must be corresponded with a single feature or not corresponded at all. We state
the problem as a sparse, convex, L1-minimization of the matching vector
regularized by the geometric constraints. This formulation allows for the
robust tracking of line segments along sequences where traditional
appearance-based matching techniques tend to fail due to dynamic changes in
illumination conditions. Moreover, the proposed matching algorithm also results
in a considerable speed-up of previous state of the art techniques making it
suitable for real-time applications such as Visual Odometry (VO). This, of
course, comes at expense of a slightly lower number of matches in comparison
with appearance based methods, and also limits its application to continuous
video sequences, as it is rather constrained to small pose increments between
consecutive frames. We validate the claimed advantages by first evaluating the
matching performance in challenging video sequences, and then testing the
method in a benchmarked point and line based VO algorithm.

automatically distributes the workload across CPUs and accelerating devices. We
demonstrate the usefulness of HSTREAM language extension with various

sourced by the torsion IR correction. As has been suggested, this phantom phase
does indeed act as to reconcile the tension between local and global
measurements of the current Hubble value $H_0$. The resulting cosmological
model predicts an electron scattering optical depth $\tau_e\thickapprox 0.058$
at reionization redshift $z_{re} \sim 8.1$, in agreement with observations. The
predictions are however in contradiction with baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) measurements, particularly the distance indicators. We argue that this is
the case with any model with a phantom dark energy model that has effects
significant enough at redshifts $z \lesssim 2$ as to be currently observable.
The reason being that such a scenario introduces systematic differences in
terms of distance estimates in relation to the standard model; e.g., if the
angular diameter distance to the recombination era is to be kept constant while
$H_0$ is increased in the context of a phantom scenario, the distances there
are systematically overestimated to all objects at redshifts smaller than
recombination. But no such discrepancies exist between $\Lambda$CDM predictions
and current data for $z \lesssim 2$.

since it simultaneously provides DRAM-like performance, disk-like capacity, and
persistency. The current NVM deployment is symmetric, where NVM devices are
directly attached to servers. Due to the higher density, NVM provides larger
capacity and can be shared among servers. Unfortunately, in the symmetric
setting, the availability of NVM devices is affected by the specific machine it
is attached to. High availability can be realized by replicating data to NVM on
a remote machine. However, it requires full replication of data structure in
local memory, limiting the size of the working set. This paper rethinks NVM
deployment and makes a case for the asymmetric NVM architecture, which
decouples servers from persistent data storage. In the proposed AsymNVM
architecture, NVM devices (back-end nodes) can be shared by multiple servers
(front-end nodes) and provide recoverable persistent data structures. The
asymmetric architecture is made possible by RDMA, and follows the recent
industry trend of resource disaggregation. We build AsymNVM framework based on
AsymNVM architecture that implements: 1) high performance persistent data
structure update; 2) NVM data management; 3) concurrency control; and 4)
crash-consistency and replication. The central idea is to use operation logs to
reduce the stall due to RDMA writes and enable efficient batching and caching
in front-end nodes. To evaluation performance, we construct eight widely used
data structures and two applications based on AsymNVM framework, and use traces
of industry workloads. In a cluster with ten machines, the results show that
AsymNVM achieves comparable performance to the best possible symmetric
architecture while avoiding all the drawbacks with disaggregation. Compared to
the baseline AsymNVM, speedup brought by the proposed optimizations is 6~22x.

process of finding generators for an ideal also terminates in finitely many

available only at the image level without any lesion delineation). Our proposed
post-hoc method automatically diagnosis the whole volume and, for positive
cases, it localizes the malignant lesions that led to such diagnosis.
Conversely, traditional approaches follow a pre-hoc approach that initially
localises suspicious areas that are subsequently classified to establish the
breast malignancy -- this approach is trained using strongly annotated data
(i.e., it needs a delineation and classification of all lesions in an image).
Another goal of this paper is to establish the advantages and disadvantages of
both approaches when applied to breast screening from DCE-MRI. Relying on
experiments on a breast DCE-MRI dataset that contains scans of 117 patients,
our results show that the post-hoc method is more accurate for diagnosing the
whole volume per patient, achieving an AUC of 0.91, while the pre-hoc method
achieves an AUC of 0.81. However, the performance for localising the malignant

strength (RSS) in an urban area is hindered by obstacles in the signal
propagation path. Current localization methods have their own advantages and
drawbacks. Triangular lateration (TL) is fast and scalable but employs a
monotone RSS-to-distance transformation that unfortunately assumes mobile
devices are on the line of sight. Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFP) methods
employ a reference database, which ensures accurate localization but
unfortunately hinders scalability.
  Here, we propose a new, simple, and robust method called lookup lateration
(LL), which incorporates the advantages of TL and RFP without their drawbacks.
Like RFP, LL employs a dataset of reference locations but stores them in
separate lookup tables with respect to RSS and antenna towers. A query
observation is localized by identifying common locations in only associating
lookup tables. Due to this decentralization, LL is two orders of magnitude
faster than RFP, making it particularly scalable for large cities. Moreover, we
show that analytically and experimentally, LL achieves higher localization
accuracy than RFP as well. For instance, using grid size 20 m, LL achieves 9.11
m and 55.66 m, while RFP achieves 72.50 m and 242.19 m localization errors at
67\% and 95\%, respectively, on the Urban Hannover Scenario dataset.

compactifications of string theory, M-theory, and F-theory to various
dimensions. In the first part of this thesis, we study the action of mirror
symmetry on two-dimensional $\cN=(2,2)$ effective theories obtained by
compactifying Type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Our focus is on
fourfold geometries with non-trivial three-form cohomology. The couplings of
the massless zero-modes arising from an expansion of the three-form
gauge-potential into these forms depend both on the complex structure
deformations and the K\""ahler structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau
fourfold. We argue that two holomorphic functions, called three-form periods,
one for each kind of deformation, capture this information. These are exchanged
under mirror symmetry, which allows us to derive them at the large complex
structure and large volume point. We discuss the application of the resulting
explicit expression to F-theory compactifications and their weak string
coupling limit. The second part of this work introduces the mathematical
machinery to derive the complete moduli dependence of the periods of
non-trivial three-forms for fourfolds realized as hypersurfaces in toric
ambient spaces. It sets the stage to determine Picard-Fuchs-type differential
equations and integral expressions for these forms. The key tool is the
observation that non-trivial three-forms on fourfold hypersurfaces in toric
ambient spaces always stem from divisors that are build out of trees of toric
surfaces fibered over Riemann surfaces. The three-form periods are then
non-trivially related to the one-form periods of these Riemann surfaces. We
conclude with two explicit example fourfolds for F-theory compactifications %in
which the three-form periods determine axion decay constants.

the F1-score error rate by 45\%, 65\%, and 63\% and the accuracy error rate by

reproduced by nucleosynthesis model in metal-free massive stars explosion. The

each sensor node builds a self-referenced trust model of its neighbourhood
using network overhearing. The node uses the trust model to autonomously adapt
its communication decisions. In the case of a network attack, a node can make
neighbour collaboration routing decisions to avoid affected regions of the
network. Mobile agents further bound the damage caused by attacks. These agents
enable a simple notification scheme which propagates collaborative decisions
from the nodes to the base station. A filtering mechanism at the base station
further validates the authenticity of the information shared by mobile agents.
We evaluate Antilizer in simulation against several routing attacks. Our
results show that Antilizer reduces data loss down to 1% (4% on average), with
operational overheads of less than 1% and provides fast network-wide
convergence.

are expected to be of the same order of magnitude. Combining our sensitive ALMA
observations with radio data from ATCA, VLA, and IR photometry from Herschel
and Spitzer, we have disentangled the synchrotron and thermal dust emission. We
determine the star-formation rates (SFR) and AGN IR luminosities using our
newly developed spectral energy distribution fitting code MrMoose. We find that
synchrotron emission contributes substantially at ~1 mm. Through our sensitive
flux limits and accounting for a contribution from synchrotron emission in the
mm, we revise downward the median SFR by a factor of 7 compared to previous
estimates based solely on Herschel and Spitzer data. The hosts of these
radio-loud AGN appear predominantly below the main sequence of star-forming
galaxies, indicating that the star formation in many of the host galaxies has
been quenched. Future growth of the host galaxies without substantial black
hole mass growth will be needed to bring these objects on the local relation
between the supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Given the
mismatch in the timescales of any star formation that took place in the host
galaxies and lifetime of the AGN, we hypothesize that a key role is played by
star formation in depleting the gas before the action of the powerful radio
jets quickly drives out the remaining gas. This positive feedback loop of
efficient star formation rapidly consuming the gas coupled to the action of the
radio jets in removing the residual gas is how massive galaxies are rapidly
quenched.

planning techniques have been presented, either focusing on learning a specific
task from demonstrations or retrieving trajectories by optimizing for

present an incremental adversarial learning-based framework that allows
inferring implicit behaviour, i.e. the natural characteristic of a set of given
trajectories. To achieve adversarial learning, a zero-sum game is constructed
between a planning algorithm and an adversary - the discriminator. We employ
the discriminator within an optimal motion planning algorithm, such that costs
can be learned and optimized iteratively, improving the integration of implicit
behavior. By combining a cost-based planning approach with trained intrinsic
behaviour, this can be be integrated also with other constraints such as
obstacles or general cost factors within a single planning framework. We
demonstrate the proposed method on a dataset for collision avoidance, as well
as for the generation of human-like trajectories from motion capture data. Our
results show that incremental adversarial learning is able to generate paths
that reflect the natural implicit behaviour of a dataset, with the ability to
improve on performance using iterative learning and generation.

the information can be used to enrich the available intelligence (about

enhance security is to encode the transmitted information with a secret key.
Relying on the channel properties, it is possible to generate a common key at
the two communication ends without transmitting it through the broadcast
channel. Since the key is generated locally, it is intrinsically secure from a
possible eavesdropper. Most of the existing physical layer key generation
techniques have been developed for symmetric channels. However, the power line
channel is in general not symmetric, but just reciprocal. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose two novel methods that exploit the reciprocity of the power
line channel to generate common information at the two intended users. This
information is processed through different quantization techniques to generate
secret keys. To assess the security of the generated keys, we analyze the
spatial correlation of the power line channels and verify the low correlation
of the possible eavesdropping channels. The two proposed methods are tested on
a measurement dataset. The results show that the information leaked to possible

deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a
promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning
solutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting
the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically
formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a
regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely
treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich
relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same
sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.

ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The
key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network
modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal
evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform
back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It

field appears to be stronger in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B. The highest value for
the longitudinal magnetic field in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B, $\left< B_{\rm

with a single parameter both from elliptical and Archimedean families. Our
approach is to analyze changes in local field potentials in the rat cortex
prior to and immediately following the onset of stroke. We present the
necessary theoretical background, the multivariate models and an illustration
of our methodology on these local field potential data. Simulations with
non-linear dependent data show information that were missed by not taking into
account dependence on specific frequencies. Moreover, these simulations
demonstrate how our proposed method captures more complex non-linear dependence
between time series. Finally, we illustrate our copula-based approach in the

optimization problems (possibly nonconvex). The method - which we call the
Hessian barrier algorithm (HBA) - combines a forward Euler discretization of
Hessian Riemannian gradient flows with an Armijo backtracking step-size policy.
In this way, HBA can be seen as an alternative to mirror descent (MD), and
contains as special cases the affine scaling algorithm, regularized Newton
processes, and several other iterative solution methods. Our main result is
that, modulo a non-degeneracy condition, the algorithm converges to the
problem's set of critical points; hence, in the convex case, the algorithm
converges globally to the problem's minimum set. In the case of linearly
constrained quadratic programs (not necessarily convex), we also show that the
method's convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(1/k^\rho)$ for some $\rho\in(0,1]$
that depends only on the choice of kernel function (i.e., not on the problem's
primitives). These theoretical results are validated by numerical experiments
in standard non-convex test functions and large-scale traffic assignment

permeability, the measurement of drug and nanoparticle transport, and the

is utilized to determine the effect of particle size on the spatiotemporal
diffusion of particles through each microenvironment, both independently and in
response to the circulation of particles in varying sequences of
microenvironments. The results show that when breast cancer cells were cultured
in the microenvironments they had a 2.62-fold higher vessel porosity relative
to vessels within healthy liver microenvironments. Hence, the permeability of
the tumor microenvironment increased by 2.35- and 2.77-fold compared to a
healthy liver for small and large particles, respectively. The ECM accumulation
rate of larger particles was 2.57-fold lower than smaller particles in a
healthy liver. However, the accumulation rate was 5.57-fold greater in the
breast tumor microenvironment. These results are in agreement with comparable
in vivo studies. Ultimately, the platform could be utilized to determine the

where $d_u$ denotes the degree of vertex $u$ in $G$. In particular, one has \[
\hom(G, H )^{1/|E(G)|} \le \hom(K_{d,d}, H )^{1/d^2} \] for every $d$-regular

upper bounds on the partition function of various statistical models such as
the Ising and Potts models, which includes independent sets and graph

  For graph colorings, corresponding to $H = K_q$, we show that the

the vertices of $K_q$ are looped. A corollary is that among $d$-regular graphs,
$G = K_{d,d}$ maximizes the quantity $c_q(G)^{1/|V(G)|}$ for every $q$ and $d$,

maximizes $\hom(G, H)^{1/|V(G)|}$. For 2-spin Ising models, our results give a
complete characterization of extremal graphs: complete bipartite graphs
maximize the partition function of 2-spin antiferromagnetic models and cliques
maximize the partition function of ferromagnetic models.

into account the errors owing to the discrepancy $\Omega \neq \Omega_h$, that
is, the issues of domain perturbation. In particular, the approximation of

we indeed prove such a discrete lifting theorem, taking advantage of the

In this article, we investigate the GWs generated by OJ 287 and their potential
detection through a pulsar timing array (PTA). First, we obtain the orbit and
the corresponding GW strain of OJ 287. During the time span of the next 10
years (2019 to 2029), the GW of OJ 287 will be active before 2021, with a peak
strain amplitude $8 \times 10^{-16}$, and then decay after that. When OJ 287 is
silent in the GW channel during 2021 to 2029, the timing residual signals of
the PTA will be dominated by the 'pulsar term' of the GW strain and this
provides an opportunity to observe this pulsar term. Furthermore, we choose 26
pulsars with white noise below 300 ns to detect the GW signal of OJ 287,
evaluating their timing residuals and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The total
SNR (with a cadence of 2 weeks in the next 10 years) of the PTA ranges from 1.9
to 2.9, corresponding to a weak GW signal for the current sensitivity level.
Subsequently, we investigate the potential measurement of the parameters of OJ
287 using these pulsars. In particular, PSR J0437-4715, with a precisely
measured distance, has the potential to constrain the polarization angle with
an uncertainty below $8^{\deg}$ and this pulsar will play an important role in
future PTA observations.

  Semantics Consistent Domain Adaptation","CVPR2019 Oral",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic
segmentation. The key in this campaign consists in reducing the domain shift,
i.e., enforcing the data distributions of the two domains to be similar. A
popular strategy is to align the marginal distribution in the feature space
through adversarial learning. However, this global alignment strategy does not
consider the local category-level feature distribution. A possible consequence
of the global movement is that some categories which are originally well
aligned between the source and target may be incorrectly mapped. To address
this problem, this paper introduces a category-level adversarial network,
aiming to enforce local semantic consistency during the trend of global
alignment. Our idea is to take a close look at the category-level data
distribution and align each class with an adaptive adversarial loss.
Specifically, we reduce the weight of the adversarial loss for category-level
aligned features while increasing the adversarial force for those poorly
aligned. In this process, we decide how well a feature is category-level
aligned between source and target by a co-training approach. In two domain
adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, we
validate that the proposed method matches the state of the art in segmentation
accuracy.

on the conditions for realizing odd-frequency pair amplitudes in the absence of

superconductor and the two nanowires induces odd-frequency spin-singlet pair
amplitudes in the substrate as well as a substantial odd-frequency interwire
pairing, both of which vanish locally. Interestingly, in the regime of strong
superconductor-nanowire tunneling, we find that the presence of two nanowires
allows for the conversion of non-local odd-frequency pairing to local
even-frequency pairing. By studying this higher-order symmetry conversion
process, we are able to identify a notable effect of the odd-frequency pairing
in the superconductor on local quantities accessible by experiments.
Specifically, we find that the odd-frequency pairing plays a direct role in the
emergence of certain subgap features in the local density of states, and,
importantly, it is responsible for a reduction of the maximum Josephson current
between the two nanowires, measurable using Josephson scanning tunneling
microscopy. We discuss ways to control the sizes of these effects induced by
odd-frequency superconductivity by tuning the parameters describing the
nanowires.

prediction that signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) would be
discovered at the LHC. One influential formulation of the principle, which
prohibits fine tuning of bare Standard Model (SM) parameters, rests on the
assumption that a particular set of values for these parameters constitute the
""fundamental parameters"" of the theory, and serve to mathematically define the
theory. On the other hand, an old argument by Wetterich suggests that fine
tuning of bare parameters merely reflects an arbitrary, inconvenient choice of
expansion parameters and that the choice of parameters in an EFT is therefore
arbitrary. We argue that these two interpretations of Higgs fine tuning reflect
distinct ways of formulating and interpreting effective field theories (EFTs)
within the Wilsonian framework: the first takes an EFT to be defined by a
single set of physical, fundamental bare parameters, while the second takes a
Wilsonian EFT to be defined instead by a whole Wilsonian renormalization group
(RG) trajectory, associated with a one-parameter class of physically equivalent
parametrizations. From this latter perspective, no single parametrization
constitutes the physically correct, fundamental parametrization of the theory,
and the delicate cancellation between bare Higgs mass and quantum corrections
appears as an eliminable artifact of the arbitrary, unphysical reference scale
with respect to which the physical amplitudes of the theory are parametrized.
While the notion of fundamental parameters is well motivated in the context of
condensed matter field theory, we explain why it may be superfluous in the
context of high energy physics.

  nonasymptotic approach","22 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.ST cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian inference typically requires the computation of an approximation to
the posterior distribution. An important requirement for an approximate
Bayesian inference algorithm is to output high-accuracy posterior mean and
uncertainty estimates. Classical Monte Carlo methods, particularly Markov Chain
Monte Carlo, remain the gold standard for approximate Bayesian inference
because they have a robust finite-sample theory and reliable convergence
diagnostics. However, alternative methods, which are more scalable or apply to
problems where Markov Chain Monte Carlo cannot be used, lack the same
finite-data approximation theory and tools for evaluating their accuracy. In
this work, we develop a flexible new approach to bounding the error of mean and
uncertainty estimates of scalable inference algorithms. Our strategy is to
control the estimation errors in terms of Wasserstein distance, then bound the
Wasserstein distance via a generalized notion of Fisher distance. Unlike
computing the Wasserstein distance, which requires access to the normalized

believed that, in a compound nucleus (CN), fluctuations in transition strengths
are drawn from a Porter-Thomas distribution (PTD), a $\chi^2$ distribution of
one degree of freedom. However, work done post-1990 at the Los Alamos Neutron
Science Center (LANSCE) and Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA)
facilities has yielded instances of neutron resonance data sets of superior
quality that are inconsistent with the PTD. In view of the importance of the
status of the PTD to the foundations of statistical reaction theory, the
question arises whether other data acquired at these facilities can be mined
for evidence of deviations from the PTD? To date, the focus has been on data
taken in the regime of isolated resonances. In this letter, arguments are put
forward in support of the analysis of measurements of the total cross section
in the regime where resonances are weakly overlapping.

devised a Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the expected time a theoretical
quantum computer could perform this calculation under the same energy
conditions as current working quantum computers. We found that, experimentally,
a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer would take $1.59 \pm 0.04$ s to
perform our simulated computation, whereas the expected optimal time under the

expected time is inversely proportional to the energy variance of our qubit
states (as expected). Finally, we propose this theoretical method for analysing
the time-efficiency of future quantum computing experiments.

of the frequency, typically the spectral peak or the spectral mean, decreases
as the waves travel down a tank or across the ocean. Many FD models rely on
wind or wave breaking. We consider seven models that do not include these
effects and compare their predictions with four sets of experiments that also
do not include these effects. The models are the (i) nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation (NLS), (ii) dissipative NLS equation (dNLS), (iii) Dysthe equation,
(iv) viscous Dysthe equation (vDysthe), (v) Gordon equation (Gordon) (which has
a free parameter), (vi) Islas-Schober equation (IS) (which has a free
parameter), and (vii) a new model, the dissipative Gramstad-Trulsen (dGT)
equation. The dGT equation has no free parameters and addresses some of the
difficulties associated with the Dysthe and vDysthe equations. We compare a
measure of overall error and the evolution of the spectral amplitudes, mean,
and peak. We find: (i) The NLS and Dysthe equations do not accurately predict
the measured spectral amplitudes. (ii) The Gordon equation, which is a
successful model of FD in optics, does not accurately model FD in water waves,
regardless of the choice of free parameter. (iii) The dNLS, vDysthe, dGT, and
IS (with optimized free parameter) models all do a reasonable job predicting
the measured spectral amplitudes, but none captures all spectral evolutions.
(iv) The vDysthe, dGT, and IS (with optimized free parameter) models do the
best at predicting the observed evolution of the spectral peak and the spectral
mean. (v) The IS model, optimized over its free parameter, has the smallest
overall error for three of the four experiments. The vDysthe equation has the
smallest overall error in the other experiment.

an unprecedented level of accuracy, requiring a similarly high level of
accuracy in the shear measurements of galaxies. Factors such as pixelisation,
imperfect point-spread function (PSF) correction, and pixel noise can all
directly or indirectly lead to biases in shear measurements, and so it can be
necessary for shear measurement methods to be calibrated against internal,
external, or simulated data to minimize bias. It is thus important to
understand the nature of this calibration. In this paper, we show that a
typical calibration procedure will on average leave no residual additive bias,
but will leave a residual multiplicative bias. Additionally, the errors on the
post-calibration bias parameters will be changed, and on average increased,
from the errors on the pre-calibration measurements of these parameters, but
that this is generally worth the benefit in decreasing the expected value of
the multiplicative bias. We find that in most typical cases, it is worthwhile
to apply a first-order bias correction, while a higher-order bias correction is
only worthwhile for methods with intrinsically high multiplicative bias ($>10$
per cent) or when the simulation size is very small ($<10^6$ simulated
galaxies).

up in the single-particle spectrum whose topological physics is revealed using
the calculation of Z2 invariants in the strongly correlated regime. A

observations of galaxy clusters in X-ray and microwave wavelengths through the
Sunyaev Zel\'dovich (SZ) effect has long been known. Previous measurements have
been plagued by relatively large errors in the observational data and severe
biases induced, for example, by cluster triaxiality and clumpiness. The advent
of \textit{Planck} allows us to map the Compton parameter y, that is, the
amplitude of the SZ effect, with unprecedented accuracy at intermediate
cluster-centric radii, which in turn allows performing a detailed spatially
resolved comparison with X-ray measurements. Given such higher quality
observational data, we developed a Bayesian approach that combines informed
priors on the physics of the intracluster medium obtained from hydrodynamical
simulations of massive clusters with measurement uncertainties.
  We apply our method to a sample of 61 galaxy clusters with redshifts up to z

by a social network, it is common to strategize about where in the network to
seed the behavior, often with an element of randomness. Selecting seeds
uniformly at random is a basic but compelling strategy in that it distributes
seeds broadly throughout the network. A more sophisticated stochastic strategy,
one-hop targeting, is to select random network neighbors of random individuals;
this exploits a version of the friendship paradox, whereby the friend of a
random individual is expected to have more friends than a random individual,
with the hope that seeding a behavior at more connected individuals leads to
more adoption. Many seeding strategies have been proposed, but empirical
evaluations have demanded large field experiments designed specifically for
this purpose and have yielded relatively imprecise comparisons of strategies.
Here we show how stochastic seeding strategies can be evaluated more
efficiently in such experiments, how they can be evaluated ""off-policy"" using
existing data arising from experiments designed for other purposes, and how to
design more efficient experiments. In particular, we consider contrasts between
stochastic seeding strategies and analyze nonparametric estimators adapted from
policy evaluation and importance sampling. We use simulations on real networks
to show that the proposed estimators and designs can increase precision while
yielding valid inference. We then apply our proposed estimators to two field
experiments, one that assigned households to an intensive marketing
intervention and one that assigned students to an anti-bullying intervention.

To address these issues, we propose a pipeline (SIMRDWN) that evaluates
satellite images of arbitrarily large size at native resolution at a rate of >
0.2 km2/s. Building upon the tensorflow object detection API paper, this
pipeline offers a unified approach to multiple object detection frameworks that

instabilities. One of the dynamic stabilization mechanisms for plasma
instability was proposed in the papers [Phys. Plasmas 19, 024503(2012) and
references therein], based on a perturbation phase control. In general,
instabilities emerge from the perturbations of the physical quantity. Normally
the perturbation phase is unknown so that the instability growth rate is
discussed. However, if the perturbation phase is known, the instability growth
can be controlled by a superimposition of perturbations imposed actively: if
the perturbation is introduced by, for example, a driving beam axis oscillation
or so, the perturbation phase can be controlled and the instability growth is
mitigated by the superimposition of the growing perturbations. Based on this
mechanism we present the application results of the dynamic stabilization
mechanism to the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability and to the filamentation
instability as typical examples in this paper. On the other hand, in the paper
[Comments Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 3, 1(1977)] another mechanism was
proposed to stabilize the R-T instability based on the strong oscillation of
acceleration, which was realized by the laser intensity modulation in laser
inertial fusion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 3131(1993)]. In the latter mechanism, the
total acceleration strongly oscillates, so that the additional oscillating
force is added to create a new stable window in the system. Originally the
latter mechanism was proposed by P. L. Kapitza, and it was applied to the
stabilization of an inverted pendulum. In this paper we review the two dynamic
stabilization mechanisms, and present the application results of the former
dynamic stabilization mechanism.

systems using a vocoder framework such as statistical parametric speech
synthesis and voice conversion are convenient especially for a limited number
of data because it is possible to represent and process interpretable acoustic
features over a compact space, such as the fundamental frequency (F0) and
mel-cepstrum. However, a well-known problem that leads to the quality
degradation of generated speech is an over-smoothing effect that eliminates
some detailed structure of generated/converted acoustic features. To address
this issue, we propose a synthetic-to-natural speech waveform conversion
technique that uses cycle-consistent adversarial networks and which does not
require any explicit assumption about speech waveform in adversarial learning.
In contrast to current techniques, since our modification is performed at the
waveform level, we expect that the proposed method will also make it possible
to generate `vocoder-less' sounding speech even if the input speech is
synthesized using a vocoder framework. The experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed method can 1) alleviate the over-smoothing effect of the
acoustic features despite the direct modification method used for the waveform
and 2) greatly improve the naturalness of the generated speech sounds.

attenuation at very low-intensity of acoustic pressures have been observed
experimentally, raising concerns on the validity of the linear attenuation
theory. Explanations of the nonlinear phenomenon are still lacking.
Particularly, the interpretation of the pressure-dependent attenuation
phenomenon is still under debate. In this note, we investigated the energy
dissipation of a single UCA via a nonlinear Rayleigh-Plesset equation and used
a formula capable of estimating attenuation coefficient due to the nonlinear
oscillation of the UCA. The simulation results show the linear oscillation of
an UCA at low excitation pressures does not always guarantee the linearity in
the energy attenuation. Although nonlinear oscillation of the UCA contributes
to the occurrence of nonlinear attenuation phenomena, it is not the only
trigger.

intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical
analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this

nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent
nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising
result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal
(system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic
expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain
systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal
finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the
analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides
with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical
examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically
interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization

We believe this is an important step of quality control that is missing in many

materials in rigid links, the rigidity of the robot is increased to an
acceptable level. We discuss one method for compensating position uncertainty
via an experimental identification technique which uses a neural network to
create a forward kinematic model. Final results show that the proposed
mechanism is able to track desired rotation with acceptable precision using
open-loop model-based control. This indicates that parallel manipulators
fabricated using lamination techniques can provide similar performance with
prototypes made in conventional methods.

modern optical telecommunications networks as a design and management tool. A
version of it, capable of handling arbitrary WDM combs and link structures in
closed form, was proposed in 2014. Here we upgrade that formula, to make it
capable of handling frequency-dependent dispersion, frequency-dependent loss
and frequency-dependent gain/loss due to Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)
among channels. This way, more challenging and complex network scenarios, like
the ones that are being deployed right now, can be dealt with in real-time, to
the great advantage of management, control and optimization of such networks.

for efficient wavelength conversion. Conventional PPLN converters however
typically require long device lengths and high pump powers due to the limited
nonlinear interaction strength. Here we use a nanostructured PPLN waveguides to
demonstrate an ultrahigh normalized efficiency of 2600%/W-cm$^2$ for
second-harmonic generation of 1.5-$\mu$m radiation, more than 20 times higher
than that in state-of-the-art diffused waveguides. This is achieved by a
combination of sub-wavelength optical confinement and high-fidelity periodic
poling at a first-order poling period of 4 $\mu$m. Our highly integrated PPLN
waveguides are promising for future chip-scale integration of classical and
quantum photonic systems.
