comparable air quality while consuming much less energy. The system comprises a
battery that makes it possible to recover the trains braking energy, arriving
under the form of erratic and strong peaks. We propose an energy management
system (EMS) that, at short time scale, controls energy flows and ventilation
airflow. By using proper optimization algorithms, we manage to match supply
with demand, while minimizing energy daily costs. For this purpose, we have
designed algorithms that take into account the braking variability. They are
based on the so-called Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) mathematical
framework. We fairly compare SDP based algorithms with the widespread Model
Predictive Control (MPC) ones. First, both SDP and MPC yield energy/money
operating savings of the order of one third, compared to the current management
without battery (our figure does not include the cost of the battery). Second,
depending on the specific design, we observe that SDP outperforms MPC by a few
percent, with an easier online numerical implementation.

linear model when the unknown error variance is also of interest. In this
paper, we show that the use of conjugate shrinkage priors for Bayesian variable

priors are often motivated by the invariance argument of Jeffreys (1961).
Revisiting this work, however, we highlight a caveat that Jeffreys himself
noticed; namely that biased estimators can result from inducing dependence
between parameters a priori. In a similar way, we show that conjugate priors
for linear regression, which induce prior dependence, can lead to such
underestimation in the Bayesian high-dimensional regression setting. Following
Jeffreys, we recommend as a remedy to treat regression coefficients and the
error variance as independent a priori. Using such an independence prior
framework, we extend the Spike-and-Slab Lasso of Rockova and George (2018) to
the unknown variance case. This extended procedure outperforms both the fixed
variance approach and alternative penalized likelihood methods on simulated
data. On the protein activity dataset of Clyde and Parmigiani (1998), the
Spike-and-Slab Lasso with unknown variance achieves lower cross-validation
error than alternative penalized likelihood methods, demonstrating the gains in
predictive accuracy afforded by simultaneous error variance estimation.

the prediction from widely accepted escaping scenario and direct interaction
scenario. We show that current $\gamma$-ray data is inconsistent with the

can be very important for the $\gamma$-ray emission in the MCs external to W28

also revisited the issue of sound waves dissipation induced by thermal
conduction in a scenario, where characteristic wavelength of the sound wave is
set by the total energy of the outburst. For a fiducial short outburst model,
the dissipation length does not exceed the cooling radius in a typical cluster,

to analyze the scattering of single photons and weak coherent states from any
generic multi-level quantum emitter coupled to a $1$D waveguide. The reduction
of the photon-scattering relation to $1$D waveguides provides for the first
time a direct solution of the scattering problem involving low intensity fields
in the waveguide QED regime. To show how our formalism works, we consider
examples of multi-level emitters and evaluate the transmitted and reflected

response of the emitters for scattering of a weak coherent photon pulse. As our
photon-scattering relation is based on the Heisenberg picture, it is quite
useful for problems involving photo-detection in the waveguide architecture. We
show this by considering a specific problem of state generation by

signal from the SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(eBOSS) Data Release 14 (DR14) quasar sample. The sample consists of 147,000
quasars distributed over a redshift range of $0.8 < z < 2.2$. We apply the
redshift weights technique to the clustering of quasars in this sample and
achieve a 4.6 per cent measurement of the angular distance measurement $D_M$ at
$z = 2.2$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at $z=0.8$. We parameterize the
distance-redshift relation, relative to a fiducial model, as a quadratic
expansion. The coefficients of this expansion are used to reconstruct the
distance-redshift relation and obtain distance and Hubble parameter
measurements at all redshifts within the redshift range of the sample.
Reporting the result at two characteristic redshifts, we determine $D_M(z=1) =
3405\pm305 \ (r_{\rm d} / r_{\rm d, fid}) \ {\rm Mpc}$, $H(z=1) = 120.7\pm 7.3

189.9\pm 32.9 \ (r_{\rm d,fid} / r_{\rm d}) \ {\rm km} \ {\rm s}^{-1}{\rm
Mpc}^{-1}$. These measurements are highly correlated. We assess the outlook of
BAO analysis from the final quasar sample by testing the method on a set of
mocks that mimic the noise level in the final sample. We demonstrate on these
mocks that redshift weighting shrinks the measurement error by over 25 per cent
on average. We conclude redshift weighting can bring us closer to the
cosmological goal of the final quasar sample.

lasting about 450 d, followed by a major brightening that reaches M_V ~ -18
mag. No source is detected to M_V > -13 mag in archival images at the position
of SNhunt151 before the slow rise. Low-to-mid-resolution optical spectra
obtained during the pronounced brightening show very little evolution, being
dominated at all times by multicomponent Balmer emission lines, a signature of
interaction between the material ejected in the new outburst and the
pre-existing circumstellar medium. We also analyzed mid-infrared images from
the Spitzer Space Telescope, detecting a source at the transient position in
2014 and 2015. Overall, SNhunt151 is spectroscopically a Type IIn SN, somewhat
similar to SN2009ip. However, there are also some differences, such as a slow
pre-discovery rise, a relatively broad light-curve peak showing a longer rise
time (~ 50 d) and a slower decline, along with a negligible change in the
temperature around the peak (T < 10^4 K). We suggest that SNhunt151 is the
result of an outburst, or a SN explosion, within a dense circumstellar nebula,
similar to those embedding some luminous blue variables like Eta Carinae and
originating from past mass-loss events.

evaluated in application to the Volvo test case. Both the non-reacting and
reacting cases are calculated. For the non- reacting cases, good agreement with
the experimental data is achieved by solvers at high numerical resolution. The
reacting cases are more challenging due to the small length scale of the flame
and the suppression of sinuous mode of absolute instability by the density
ratio. The analysis of the turbulent simulation data using the concept of the
Lyapunov exponent and the Wasserstein metric provides a more quantitative
approach to assess the mesh dependency of the simulation results. The
convergence of the Lyapunov exponent is shown to be a more sensitive and
stronger indication of mesh-independence. Though grid convergence for the
reacting cases cannot be reached with the chosen resolutions, the Lyapunov
exponents and the Wasserstein metric are shown to be capable of identifying
quantity-specific sensitivities with respect to the numerical resolution, while
requiring significantly less computational resources than acquiring profiles of
conventional turbulent statistics.

components have in general different properties. It was discussed in 1975 by
Andreev and Bashkin, in the context of He$^3$/He$^4$ superfluid mixtures, that
inter-particle interactions produce a dissipationless drag. The drag can be
understood as a superflow of one component induced by phase gradients of the
other component. Importantly the drag can be both positive (entrainment) and
negative (counter-flow). The effect is known to be of crucial importance for
many properties of diverse physical systems ranging from the dynamics of
neutron stars, rotational responses of Bose mixtures of ultra-cold atoms to
magnetic responses of multicomponent superconductors. Although there exists a
substantial literature that includes the drag interaction phenomenologically,
much fewer regimes are covered by quantitative studies of the microscopic
origin of the drag and its dependence on microscopic parameters. Here we study
the microscopic origin and strength of the drag interaction in a quantum system
of two-component bosons on a lattice with short-range interaction. By
performing quantum Monte-Carlo simulations of a two-component Bose-Hubbard
model we obtain dependencies of the drag strength on the boson-boson
interactions and properties of the optical lattice. Of particular interest are
the strongly-correlated regimes where the ratio of co-flow and counter-flow
superfluid stiffnesses can diverge, corresponding to the case of saturated
drag.

generalizes a previously known result on discriminant-growth in

incorporating a possible dark matter candidate through the radiation
annihilation process during reheating and the current value of dark matter

number of particles in the packing that have at least two contacts is a good
predictor for the mechanical state of the system, regardless of strain history
and packing density. All measures explored in both experiments and numerics,
including stress tensor derived measures and contact numbers depend in a
universal manner on the fraction of non-rattler particles, $f_{NR}$. The force
network topology also tends to show this universality, yet the shape of the
master curve depends much more on the details of the numerical simulations. In
particular we show that adding force noise to the numerical data set can
significantly alter the topological features in the data. We conclude that both

of rod-shaped bacteria were observed at single-cell resolution and shown to
develop from a disordered, two-dimensional layer of founder cells into a
three-dimensional structure with a vertically-aligned core. Here, we elucidate
the physical mechanism underpinning this transition using a combination of
agent-based and continuum modeling. We find that verticalization proceeds
through a series of localized mechanical instabilities on the cellular scale.
For short cells, these instabilities are primarily triggered by cell division,
whereas long cells are more likely to be peeled off the surface by nearby
vertical cells, creating an ""inverse domino effect"". The interplay between cell
growth and cell verticalization gives rise to an exotic mechanical state in
which the effective surface pressure becomes constant throughout the growing
core of the biofilm surface layer. This dynamical isobaricity determines the
expansion speed of a biofilm cluster and thereby governs how cells access the
third dimension. In particular, theory predicts that a longer average cell
length yields more rapidly expanding, flatter biofilms. We experimentally show
that such changes in biofilm development occur by exploiting chemicals that
modulate cell length.

certain second order transitions present in condensed matter such as liquid

photosynthetic light harvesting complex might have different types of coherent
ground and excited states, suggesting that there are two different symmetry
breaking transitions. The B 850 ground states comprise eight identical rings
each containing 18 bacteriochlorophyll components, and each ring has undergone
a Bose Einstein phase transition to a charge density wave that lowers the
energy. The excited state coherence results from polariton formation from the
non-crossing of bosons, here an extension of exciton theory. The result is
short-lived quasi-particles with very low mass that can form an unusual BEC. We
suggest the oriented, circular B 850 and enclosed singlet B 875 compounds

suggested to detect nearby drones, they all suffer from the same shortcoming:
they cannot identify exactly what is being captured, and therefore they fail to
distinguish between the legitimate use of a drone (for example, to use a drone
to film a selfie from the air) and illegitimate use that invades someone's
privacy (when the same operator uses the drone to stream the view into the
window of his neighbor's apartment), a distinction that in some cases depends
on the orientation of the drone's video camera rather than on the drone's
location. In this paper we shatter the commonly held belief that the use of
encryption to secure an FPV channel prevents an interceptor from extracting the
POI that is being streamed. We show methods that leverage physical stimuli to
detect whether the drone's camera is directed towards a target in real time. We
investigate the influence of changing pixels on the FPV channel (in a lab
setup). Based on our observations we demonstrate how an interceptor can perform
a side-channel attack to detect whether a target is being streamed by analyzing
the encrypted FPV channel that is transmitted from a real drone (DJI Mavic) in
two use cases: when the target is a private house and when the target is a
subject.

boundary layer penetrates deeper into the flow. However, for $D_2\geq 10\,
D_1$, where $D_1$ and $D_2$ are, respectively, the diffusion coefficients of

single message (file) out of $M$ messages from $N$ distributed databases under
the new constraint of \emph{asymmetric traffic} from databases. In this
problem, the \emph{ratios between the traffic} from the databases are
constrained, i.e., the ratio of the length of the answer string that the user
(retriever) receives from the $n$th database to the total length of all answer
strings from all databases is constrained to be $\tau_n$. This may happen if
the user's access to the databases is restricted due database availability,
channel quality to the databases, and other factors. For this problem, for
fixed $M$, $N$, we develop a general upper bound $\bar{C}(\boldsymbol{\tau})$,
which generalizes the converse proof of Sun-Jafar, where database symmetry was
inherently used. Our converse bound is a piece-wise affine function in the
traffic ratio vector $\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_N)$. For the
lower bound, we explicitly show the achievability of $\binom{M+N-1}{M}$ corner
points. For the remaining traffic ratio vectors, we perform time-sharing
between these corner points. The recursive structure of our achievability
scheme is captured via a system of difference equations. The upper and lower

$\boldsymbol{\tau}$. The results show strict loss of PIR capacity due to the
asymmetric traffic constraints compared with the symmetric case of Sun-Jafar

photoionisation models, we determine both the gas phase metallicity and
hardness of the ionisation spectrum characterised by xi_ion - the number of
Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity. We confirm our earlier suggestion
that xi_ion is significantly larger for LAEs than for continuum-selected Lyman

Generally, many-qubit entangled states are often used to complete BQC tasks.
But for a large-scale entangled state, it is difficult to be described since
its Hilbert space dimension is increasing exponentially. Furthermore, the
number of entangled qubits is limited in experiment of existing works. To
tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a universal BQC protocol based on

initial single-qubit states and a server that performs universal quantum
computation. The client is almost classical since she does not require any
quantum computational power, quantum memory. To realize the client's universal
BQC, we construct an $m\times n$ latticed state composed of six-qubit cluster
states and eight-qubit cluster states, which needs less qubits than the
brickwork state. Finally, we analyze and prove the blindness, correctness,
universality and verifiability of our proposed BQC protocol.

Our main objective in this work is switching from less efficient to a more
efficient model and to characterize extreme behavior of core arrival in
remanufacturing and applying the developed model to triage cores. Central
tendency core flow models are not sufficient to handle extreme situations,
however, complementary Extreme Value (EV) approaches have shown to improve
model efficiency. Extreme core flows to remanufacturing facilities are rare but
still likely and can adversely affect remanufacturing business operations. In
this investigation, extreme end-of-use core flow is modelled by a threshold
approach using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). It is shown that GPD
has better performance than its maxima-block GEV counterpart from practical and
data efficiency perspectives. The model is validated by a synthesized big
dataset, tested by sophisticated statistical Anderson Darling (AD) test, and is
applied to a case of extreme flow to a valve shop in order to predict
probability of over-capacity arrivals that is critical in remanufacturing
business management. Finally, the GPD model combined with triage strategies is
used to initiate investigations into the efficacy of different triage methods

radio emission is well described by either an exponential or the canonical
$t^{-5/3}$ decay assumed for tidal disruption events. The correlation between
radio and X-ray emission during this period can be fit as $L_{R}\propto
L_{X}^{1.9\pm0.2}$. After 400 days the radio emission at $15.5\,\textrm{GHz}$
has reached a plateau level of $244\pm8\,\mu\textrm{Jy}$ which it maintains for
at least the next 600 days, while the X-ray emission continues to fade

separated in age by about 1 Myr in very young clusters (VYCs, ages less than 10

converging inflow of molecular gas building up a first population of pre-main
sequence stars. The associated just-formed O stars ionise the inflow and
suppress star formation in the embedded cluster. However, they typically eject
each other out of the embedded cluster within 10^6 yr, that is before the
molecular cloud filament can be ionised entirely. The inflow of molecular gas
can then resume forming a second population. This sequence of events can be
repeated multiply. This model is applied to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), in
which three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram of
the cluster have recently been discovered. The mass-inflow history is
constrained using this model and the number of OB stars ejected from each
population are estimated for verification using Gaia data. As a consequence of
the proposed model, the three runaway O star systems, AE Aur, mu Col and iota
Ori, are considered as significant observational evidence for stellar-dynamical
ejections of massive stars from the oldest population in the ONC.

Using a spherical overdensity algorithm to identify dark-matter haloes, we
construct halo merger trees for different values of the over-density
$\Delta_c$. While the virial overdensity definition allows us to probe the
accretion of satellites at the cluster virial radius $r_{vir}$, higher
overdensities probe satellite mergers in the central region of the cluster,
down to $\approx 0.06 r_{vir}$, which can be considered a proxy for the
accretion of satellite galaxies onto central galaxies. We find that the
characteristic merger mass ratio increases for increasing values of $\Delta_c$:
more than $60\%$ of the mass accreted by central galaxies since $z\approx 1$
comes from major mergers. The orbits of satellites accreting onto central
galaxies tend to be more tangential and more bound than orbits of haloes
accreting at the virial radius. The obtained distributions of merger mass
ratios and orbital parameters are useful to model the evolution of the
high-mass end of the galaxy scaling relations without resorting to hydrodynamic

celestial hemisphere, enabling the detection of faint stellar streams to a
heliocentric distance of $\sim 50$ kpc. We search for stellar streams using a
matched-filter in color-magnitude space derived from a synthetic isochrone of
an old, metal-poor stellar population. Our detection technique recovers four
previously known thin stellar streams: Phoenix, ATLAS, Tucana III, and a
possible extension of Molonglo. In addition, we report the discovery of eleven
new stellar streams. In general, the new streams detected by DES are fainter,
more distant, and lower surface brightness than streams detected by similar
techniques in previous photometric surveys. As a by-product of our stellar
stream search, we find evidence for extra-tidal stellar structure associated
with four globular clusters: NGC 288, NGC 1261, NGC 1851, and NGC 1904. The
ever-growing sample of stellar streams will provide insight into the formation
of the Galactic stellar halo, the Milky Way gravitational potential, as well as
the large- and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way.

Their properties provide a unique opportunity to constrain binary evolution,
which is still poorly understood. In this paper, we predict the inventory of
binary black holes and their merger products in/around the Milky Way, and
detail their main properties. We present the first combination of a
high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with a
binary population synthesis model. The hydrodynamic simulation, taken from the
FIRE project, provides a cosmologically realistic star formation history for
the galaxy and its stellar halo and satellites. We apply a
metallicity-dependent evolutionary model to the star particles to produce
individual binary black holes. We find that a million binary black holes have
merged in the model Milky Way, and 3 million binaries are still present, with
an average mass of 28 Msun per binary. Because the black hole progenitors are
biased towards low metallicity stars, half reside in the stellar halo and
satellites and 40 per cent of the binaries were formed outside the main galaxy.
This trend increases with the masses of the black holes. The numbers and mass
distribution of the merged systems is compatible with the LIGO/Virgo
detections. Observations of these black holes will be challenging, both with
electromagnetic methods and LISA. We find that a cosmologically realistic star
formation history, with self-consistent metal enrichment and Galactic accretion
history, are key ingredients for determining binary black hole rates that can
be compared with observations to constrain massive binary evolution.

spectrum, including an iron K$\alpha$ line, resulting from hard X-ray continuum
photons illuminating the accretion disk. The reverberation lag resulting from
the path length difference between direct and reflected emission provides a
powerful tool to probe the innermost regions around both stellar-mass and
supermassive black holes. Here, we present for the first time a reverberation
mapping formalism that enables modeling of energy dependent time lags and
variability amplitude for a wide range of variability timescales, taking the
complete information of the cross-spectrum into account. We use a pivoting
power-law model to account for the spectral variability of the continuum that
dominates over the reverberation lags for longer time scale variability. We use
an analytic approximation to self-consistently account for the non-linear
effects caused by this continuum spectral variability, which have been ignored
by all previous reverberation studies. We find that ignoring these non-linear
effects can bias measurements of the reverberation lags, particularly at low
frequencies. Since our model is analytic, we are able to fit simultaneously for
a wide range of Fourier frequencies without prohibitive computational expense.
We also introduce a formalism of fitting to real and imaginary parts of our
cross-spectrum statistic, which naturally avoids some mistakes/inaccuracies
previously common in the literature. We perform proof-of-principle fits to

the Big Bang. The few z~10-11 candidates discovered to date have been
exceptionally small- barely resolved, if at all, by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Here we present the discovery of SPT0615-JD, a fortuitous z~10
(z_phot=9.9+/-0.6) galaxy candidate stretched into an arc over ~2.5"" by the
effects of strong gravitational lensing. Discovered in the Reionization Lensing
Cluster Survey (RELICS) Hubble Treasury program and companion S-RELICS Spitzer
program, this candidate has a lensed H-band magnitude of 25.7+/-0.1 AB mag.
With a magnification of \mu~4-7 estimated from our lens models, the de-lensed
intrinsic magnitude is 27.6+/-0.3 AB mag, and the half-light radius is r_e<0.8
kpc, both consistent with other z>9 candidates. The inferred stellar mass (log
[M* /M_Sun]=9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.5}) and star formation rate (\log [SFR/M_Sun
yr^{-1}]=1.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) indicate that this candidate is a typical
star-forming galaxy on the z>6 SFR-M* relation. We note that three independent
lens models predict two counterimages, at least one of which should be of a
similar magnitude to the arc, but these counterimages are not yet detected.
Counterimages would not be expected if the arc were at lower redshift. However,
the only spectral energy distributions capable of fitting the Hubble and
Spitzer photometry well at lower redshifts require unphysical combinations of
z~2 galaxy properties. The unprecedented lensed size of this z~10 candidate
offers the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope to study the geometric

scaling relations observed in the Milky Way, such as the mass-size ($M$--$R$),
velocity dispersion-size ($\sigma$--$R$), and the $\sigma$--$R\Sigma$

with $M\propto R^{2.3}$ and $\sigma\propto R^{0.56}$. When analysed in 3D, GMC
scaling relations steepen significantly, indicating potential limitations of
our understanding of molecular cloud 3D structure from observations.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how a GMC population's underlying distribution of
virial parameters can strongly influence the scatter in derived scaling
relations. Finally, we show that GMCs with nearly identical global properties
exist in different evolutionary stages, where a majority of clouds being either
gravitationally bound or expanding, but with a significant fraction being
compressed by external ISM pressure, at all times.

properties of galaxies. While $^{12}$CO has been targeted extensively,
isotopologues such as $^{13}$CO have the advantage of being less optically
thick and observations have recently become accessible across full galaxy
discs. We present a comprehensive new dataset of $^{13}$CO(1-0) observations
with the IRAM 30-m telescope of the full discs of 9 nearby spiral galaxies from
the EMPIRE survey at a spatial resolution of $\sim$1.5kpc. $^{13}$CO(1-0) is
mapped out to $0.7-1r_{25}$ and detected at high signal-to-noise throughout our
maps. We analyse the $^{12}$CO(1-0)-to-$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio ($\Re$) as a
function of galactocentric radius and other parameters such as the
$^{12}$CO(2-1)-to-$^{12}$CO(1-0) intensity ratio, the 70-to-160$\mu$m flux
density ratio, the star-formation rate surface density, the star-formation
efficiency, and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. We find that $\Re$ varies by
a factor of 2 at most within and amongst galaxies, with a median value of 11
and larger variations in the galaxy centres than in the discs. We argue that
optical depth effects, most likely due to changes in the mixture of
diffuse/dense gas, are favored explanations for the observed $\Re$ variations,
while abundance changes may also be at play. We calculate a spatially-resolved
$^{13}$CO(1-0)-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and find an average value of
$1.0\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K.km/s)$^{-1}$ over our sample with a standard
deviation of a factor of 2. We find that $^{13}$CO(1-0) does not appear to be a
good predictor of the bulk molecular gas mass in normal galaxy discs due to the
presence of a large diffuse phase, but it may be a better tracer of the mass
than $^{12}$CO(1-0) in the galaxy centres where the fraction of dense gas is
larger.

regular honeycomb alignment, the remaining body has a feature of triangular
lattice. In this work, we reveal that the electronic states in graphene sheets
with nano-sized holes in triangular and honeycomb alignments are also dual to
each other in a topological sense. Namely, a regular hole array perforated in
graphene can open a band gap in the energy-momentum dispersion of relativistic
electrons in the pristine graphene, and the insulating states induced by
triangular and honeycomb hole arrays are distinct in topology. In a graphene
patchwork with regions of these two hole arrays put side by side
counterpropagating topological currents emerge at the domain wall. This
observation indicates that the cerebrated atomically thin sheet is where
topological physics and nanotechnology meet.

Particularly, quantum spin ice hosts monopoles as bosonic spinons coupled to
emergent gauge fields in a U(1) quantum spin liquid, namely, a deconfined
Coulomb phase. When monopoles are condensed to form a long-range order,
monopoles and gauge fields are screened and confined. Here we show, however,
that monopole supercurrent flows across a junction of two ferromagnets that are
weakly linked through and placed on top of the U(1) QSL, when a gauge-invariant
phase difference of spinons across the junction is generated by quenching or an
applied electric voltage parallel to the junction. This novel phenomenon paves
the way to a new paradigm of spinonics for a dissipationless control of

interactions with them. Grasping smooth materials, for example, requires care,
and softness is an ideal property for fabric used in bedding. Even when these
properties are not visual (e.g. softness is a physical property), we may still
infer their presence visually. We refer to such material properties as visual
material attributes. Recognizing these attributes in images can contribute
valuable information for general scene understanding and material recognition.
Unlike well-known object and scene attributes, visual material attributes are
local properties with no fixed shape or spatial extent. We show that given a
set of images annotated with known material attributes, we may accurately
recognize the attributes from small local image patches. Obtaining such
annotations in a consistent fashion at scale, however, is challenging. To
address this, we introduce a method that allows us to probe the human visual
perception of materials by asking simple yes/no questions comparing pairs of
image patches. This provides sufficient weak supervision to build a set of
attributes and associated classifiers that, while unnamed, serve the same
function as the named attributes we use to describe materials. Doing so allows
us to recognize visual material attributes without resorting to exhaustive
manual annotation of a fixed set of named attributes. Furthermore, we show that
this method may be integrated in the end-to-end learning of a material
classification CNN to simultaneously recognize materials and discover their
visual attributes. Our experimental results show that visual material
attributes, whether named or automatically discovered, provide a useful
intermediate representation for known material categories themselves as well as
a basis for transfer learning when recognizing previously-unseen categories.

perturbed by a variety of forces. We simulate the dynamical evolution of the

arc is distributed more widely in the azimuthal direction, extending to a range
of [30,120] degrees relative to Jupiter. The peak number density does not

(moons, Jupiter, or escape from the system). Configurations of dust number
density in the Jovicentric equatorial inertial frame are calculated and shown.
In a Jovicentric frame rotating with the Sun the dust distributions are found
to be asymmetric. For certain small particle sizes, the dust population is
displaced towards the Sun, while for certain larger sizes, the dust population
is displaced away from the Sun. The average lifetime as a function of particle
size for ejecta from each source moon is derived, and two sharp jumps in the
average lifetime are analyzed. Transport of dust between the Galilean moons and
to Jupiter is investigated. Most of the orbits for dust particles from Galilean

to become retrograde mainly due to solar radiation pressure and Lorentz force.
The distribution of orbital elements is also analyzed.

exploding gradients. An idea to combat this issue is gradient descent with
proportional updates. Gradient descent with proportional updates was introduced
in 2017. It was independently developed by You et al (Layer-wise Adaptive Rate
Scaling (LARS) algorithm) and by Abu-El-Haija (PercentDelta algorithm). The
basic idea of both of these algorithms is to make each step of the gradient
descent proportional to the current weight norm and independent of the gradient
magnitude. It is common in the context of new optimization methods to prove
convergence or derive regret bounds under the assumption of Lipschitz
continuity and convexity. However, even though LARS and PercentDelta were shown
to work well in practice, there is no theoretical analysis of the convergence
properties of these algorithms. Thus it is not clear if the idea of gradient
descent with proportional updates is used in the optimal way, or if it could be
improved by using a different norm or specific learning rate schedule, for
example. Moreover, it is not clear if these algorithms can be extended to other
problems, besides neural networks. We attempt to answer these questions by
establishing the theoretical analysis of gradient descent with proportional
updates, and verifying this analysis with empirical examples.

Here, we show that strong coupling can occur in a deep subwavelength nanofilm

network phases, abound in soft matter assemblies, from block copolymers (BCPs),
lyotropic liquid crystals and surfactants to functional architectures in
biology. While TPNs are, in reality, volume-filling patterns of
spatially-varying molecular composition, physical and structural models most
often reduce their structure to lower-dimensional geometric objects: the {\it
2D interfaces} between chemical domains; and the {\it 1D skeletons} that thread
through inter-connected, tubular domains. These lower-dimensional structures
provide a useful basis of comparison to idealized geometries based on
triply-periodic minimal, or constant-mean curvature surfaces, and shed
important light on the spatially heterogeneous packing of molecular
constituents that form the networks. Here, we propose a simple, efficient and
flexible method to extract a 1D skeleton from 3D volume composition data of
self-assembled networks. We apply this method to both self-consistent field
theory predictions as well as experimental electron microtomography
reconstructions of the double-gyroid phase of an ABA triblock copolymer. We
further demonstrate how the analysis of 1D skeleton, 2D inter-domain surfaces,
and combinations therefore, provide physical and structural insight into TPNs,
across multiple length scales. Specifically, we propose and compare simple
measures of {\it network chirality} as well as {\it domain thickness}, and
analyze their spatial and statistical distributions in both ideal (theoretical)
and non-ideal (experimental) double gyroid assemblies.

several large-scale object detection benchmarks. However, training such

issue by transforming image-level classifiers into object detectors. This is
done by modeling the differences between the two on categories with both
image-level and bounding box annotations, and transferring this information to
convert classifiers to detectors for categories without bounding box
annotations. We improve this previous work by incorporating knowledge about
object similarities from visual and semantic domains during the transfer
process. The intuition behind our proposed method is that visually and
semantically similar categories should exhibit more common transferable
properties than dissimilar categories, e.g. a better detector would result by
transforming the differences between a dog classifier and a dog detector onto
the cat class, than would by transforming from the violin class. Experimental
results on the challenging ILSVRC2013 detection dataset demonstrate that each
of our proposed object similarity based knowledge transfer methods outperforms
the baseline methods. We found strong evidence that visual similarity and

improve detection, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance in a

poorly when modest misspecification is present in both models (Kang and

use Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., 2010) to provide
highly robust propensity and mean model estimation. We term these

the relay and to the destination, and the relay helps the communication by
transmitting an additional message to the destination via a separate channel.
Two well-known coding techniques have been introduced for this setting:
decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward. In decode-and-forward, the relay
completely decodes the message and sends some information to the destination;
in compress-and-forward, the relay does not decode, and it sends a compressed
version of the received signal to the destination using Wyner-Ziv coding. In
this paper, we present a novel coding paradigm that provides an improved
achievable rate for the primitive relay channel. The idea is to combine
compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward via a chaining construction. We
transmit over pairs of blocks: in the first block, we use compress-and-forward;
and in the second block, we use decode-and-forward. More specifically, in the
first block, the relay does not decode, it compresses the received signal via
Wyner-Ziv, and it sends only part of the compression to the destination. In the
second block, the relay completely decodes the message, it sends some
information to the destination, and it also sends the remaining part of the
compression coming from the first block. By doing so, we are able to strictly
outperform both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Note that the
proposed coding scheme can be implemented with polar codes. As such, it has the
typical attractive properties of polar coding schemes, namely, quasi-linear
encoding and decoding complexity, and error probability that decays at
super-polynomial speed. As a running example, we take into account the special
case of the erasure relay channel, and we provide a comparison between the
rates achievable by our proposed scheme and the existing upper and lower
bounds.

carried out with CARMA have an angular resolution of ~7"", a spectral resolution
of ~0.16 km/s and a sensitivity of 50-100 mJy/beam. Although the large scale
structure compares well with the Herschel dust continuum maps, we resolve finer
structure within the filaments identified by Herschel. The H13CO+ emission
distribution agrees with the existing CARMA N2H+ (J=1-0) maps; so they trace
the same morphology and kinematics of the filaments. The H13CO+ maps
additionally reveal that many regions have multiple structures partially
overlapping in the line-of-sight. In two regions, the velocity differences are
as high as 1.4 m/s. We identify 8 filamentary structures having typical widths
of 0.03-0.08 pc in these tracers. At least 50% of the filamentary structures
have distinct velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axis with average
values in the range 4-10 km/s/pc. These findings are in support of the
theoretical models of filament formation by 2-D inflow in the shock layer
created by colliding turbulent cells. We also find evidence of velocity
gradients along the length of two filamentary structures; the gradients suggest
that these filaments are inflowing towards the cloud core.

the DE in the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter (KNdS) BH background using a generalised
Kinnersley null tetrad in the Newman-Penrose formalism. In this frame, we prove
the separation of the DE into ordinary differential equations for the radial

dependent variables we prove that the transformed radial equation for a massive
charged spin $\frac{1}{2}$ fermion in the background KNdS BH constitutes a
highly non-trivial generalisation of Heun's equation. Using a
Regge-Wheeler-like independent variable we transform the radial equation in the
KNdS background into a Schr\""{o}dinger-like differential equation and
investigate its asymptotic behaviour near the event and cosmological horizons.
For a massive fermion (MF) in the background of a Kerr-Newman (KN) BH we first
prove that the radial and angular equations that result from the separation of
DE reduce to the generalised Heun differential equation (GHE). The local
solutions of such GHE are derived and can be described by holomorphic functions
whose power series coefficients are determined by a four-term recurrence
relation. Using asymptotic analysis we derive the solutions for the MF far away
from the KN BH and the solutions near the event horizon . The determination of
the separation constant as an eigenvalue problem in the KN background is
investigated. Using the aforementioned four-term recursion formula we prove
that in the non-extreme KN geometry there are no bound states with
$\omega^2<\mu^2$, where $\omega$ and $\mu$ are the energy and mass of the

Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP): the problem of finding a mapping of a
request graph (describing a workload) onto a substrate graph (describing the
physical infrastructure). Applications range from mapping testbeds (from where
the problem originated), over the embedding of batch-processing workloads
(virtual clusters) to the embedding of service function chains. The different
applications come with their own specific requirements and constraints,
including node mapping constraints, routing policies, and latency constraints.
While the VNEP has been studied intensively over the last years, complexity
results are only known for specific models and we lack a comprehensive
understanding of its hardness.
  This paper charts the complexity landscape of the VNEP by providing a
systematic analysis of the hardness of a wide range of VNEP variants, using a
unifying and rigorous proof framework. In particular, we show that the problem
of finding a feasible embedding is NP-complete in general, and, hence, the VNEP
cannot be approximated under any objective, unless P=NP holds. Importantly, we
derive NP-completeness results also for finding approximate embeddings, which
may violate, e.g., capacity constraints by certain factors. Lastly, we prove
that our results still pertain when restricting the request graphs to planar or
degree-bounded graphs.

simulations of molecular clouds undergoing global, multi-scale gravitational
collapse. In these simulations, filaments are not in a static equilibrium, but
are long-lived flow structures that accrete gas from their environment and
direct it toward clumps embedded in the filament or at the nodes at the
conjunction with other filaments. In this context, the magnetic field is
dragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that
generates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and
the magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas
density increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to
the filament, and magnetic lines also tend to align with it. At the spine of
the filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they
must connect to lines on the opposite side of the filament, resulting in
""U""-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal
flow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas
to continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of
the flow balances the magnetic tension, the curvature of the field lines is
determined by the diffusion rate. We derive an expression relating the
curvature of the field lines to the diffusive coefficient, which may be used to
observationally determine the nature of the diffusive process.

goal of understanding the origin of cosmic acceleration. DES performs a 5000
square degree survey of the southern sky in five optical bands (g,r,i,z,Y) to a
depth of ~24th magnitude. Contemporaneously, DES performs a deep, time-domain
survey in four optical bands (g,r,i,z) over 27 square degrees. DES exposures
are processed nightly with an evolving data reduction pipeline and evaluated
for image quality to determine if they need to be retaken. Difference imaging
and transient source detection are also performed in the time domain component
nightly. On a bi-annual basis, DES exposures are reprocessed with a refined
pipeline and coadded to maximize imaging depth. Here we describe the DES image
processing pipeline in support of DES science, as a reference for users of
archival DES data, and as a guide for future astronomical surveys.

generalize this to a derivation of the condition for the existence of a
conformal transformation to a spacetime satisfying the Einstein equation with
matter sources. Then, enlarging the symmetry from Poincar\'e to Weyl, we
develop the Cartan structure equations of Weyl geometry, the form of the
curvature tensor and its relationship to the Riemann curvature of the

photometric bands, grizY. DES DR1 has a median delivered point-spread function
of g = 1.12, r = 0.96, i = 0.88, z = 0.84, and Y = 0.90 arcsec FWHM, a
photometric precision of < 1% in all bands, and an astrometric precision of 151

includes nearly 400M distinct astronomical objects detected in ~10,000 coadd
tiles of size 0.534 sq. deg. produced from ~39,000 individual exposures.
Benchmark galaxy and stellar samples contain ~310M and ~ 80M objects,
respectively, following a basic object quality selection. These data are
accessible through a range of interfaces, including query web clients, image

compare existing methods using a public dataset objectively, to determine the
performance of the best breast tumor segmentation algorithm available today,
and to investigate what segmentation strategies are valuable in clinical
practice and theoretical study. In this work, a benchmark for B-mode breast
ultrasound image segmentation is presented. In the benchmark, 1) we collected
562 breast ultrasound images, prepared a software tool, and involved four
radiologists in obtaining accurate annotations through standardized procedures;
2) we extensively compared the performance of sixteen state-of-the-art

to describe various complex physical systems, however to perform full
uncertainty quantification we often need to employ emulators. An emulator is a
fast statistical construct that mimics the complex computer model, and greatly
aids the vastly more computationally intensive uncertainty quantification
calculations that a serious scientific analysis often requires. In some cases,
the complex model can be solved far more efficiently for certain parameter
settings, leading to boundaries or hyperplanes in the input parameter space
where the model is essentially known. We show that for a large class of
Gaussian process style emulators, multiple boundaries can be formally
incorporated into the emulation process, by Bayesian updating of the emulators
with respect to the boundaries, for trivial computational cost. The resulting
updated emulator equations are given analytically. This leads to emulators that
possess increased accuracy across large portions of the input parameter space.
We also describe how a user can incorporate such boundaries within standard
black box GP emulation packages that are currently available, without altering
the core code. Appropriate designs of model runs in the presence of known
boundaries are then analysed, with two kinds of general purpose designs
proposed. We then apply the improved emulation and design methodology to an
important systems biology model of hormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis Thaliana.

given an uncertain, weighted (hyper)graph, how can we efficiently find a
(hyper)matching with high expected reward, and low risk?
  This problem naturally arises in the context of several important
applications, such as online dating, kidney exchanges, and team formation. We
introduce a novel formulation for finding matchings with maximum expected
reward and bounded risk under a general model of uncertain weighted
(hyper)graphs that we introduce in this work. Our model generalizes
probabilistic models used in prior work, and captures both continuous and
discrete probability distributions, thus allowing to handle privacy related
applications that inject appropriately distributed noise to (hyper)edge
weights. Given that our optimization problem is NP-hard, we turn our attention
to designing efficient approximation algorithms. For the case of uncertain
weighted graphs, we provide a $\frac{1}{3}$-approximation algorithm, and a
$\frac{1}{5}$-approximation algorithm with near optimal run time. For the case
of uncertain weighted hypergraphs, we provide a
$\Omega(\frac{1}{k})$-approximation algorithm, where $k$ is the rank of the
hypergraph (i.e., any hyperedge includes at most $k$ nodes), that runs in
almost (modulo log factors) linear time.
  We complement our theoretical results by testing our approximation algorithms
on a wide variety of synthetic experiments, where we observe in a controlled
setting interesting findings on the trade-off between reward, and risk. We also
provide an application of our formulation for providing recommendations of
teams that are likely to collaborate, and have high impact.

study of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The expansions
based on multiple and iterated Fourier-Legendre series as well as on multiple
and iterated trigonomectic Fourier series converging in the mean and pointwise
are presented in the article. Some of these theorems are connected with the
iterated stochastic integrals of multiplicities $1-6$. Also we consider two
theorems on expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary
multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier
series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ as well
as two theorems on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of
arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized iterated
Fourier series converging pointwise. On the base of the presented theorems we
formulate three Hypotheses on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic
integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized
multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space
$L_2([t, T]^k).$ The proof of Hypothesis $2$ is given under the condition of
convergence of trace series. The mentioned iterated Stratonovich stochastic
integrals are part of the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. Moreover, most of the
considered expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals contain
only one operation of the limit transition and substantially simpler than their
analogues for iterated Ito stochastic integrals. The results of the article can
be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.
Also, the results of the article were reformulated in the form of theorems of
the Wong-Zakai type for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals.

orbital decay by gravitational-wave radiation. However, a significant fraction
with low mass ratios will survive for a long time as a consequence of stable
mass transfer. Such stable mass transfer between two helium white dwarfs (HeWD)
provides one channel for the production of AM\,CVn binary stars. In previous
calculations of double HeWD progenitors, the accreting HeWD was treated as a
point mass. We have computed the evolution of 16 double HeWD models in order to
investigate the consequences of treating the detailed evolution of both
components. We find that the boundary between binaries having stable and
unstable mass transfer is slightly modified by this approach. By comparing with
observed periods and mass ratios, we redetermine masses of eight known AM\,CVn
stars by our double HeWDs channel, i.e. HM\,Cnc, AM CVn, V406\,Hya, J0926,
J1240, GP\,Com, Gaia14aae and V396\,Hya. We propose that central spikes in the
triple-peaked emission spectra of J1240, GP\,Com and V396\,Hya and the surface
abundance ratios of N/C/O in GP\,Com can be explained by the stable double HeWD

the predicted gravitational wave signal in the context of the Laser

(strings, domain walls, etc.) can be understood as possessing generalised
global symmetries even when the microscopic origins of these symmetries are
unknown. Using this philosophy, we build an effective theory of a
$2+1$-dimensional fluid state with two perpendicular sets of immersed elastic
line defects. When the number of defects is independently conserved in each
set, then the state possesses two one-form symmetries. Normally, such
viscoelastic states are described as fluids coupled to Goldstone bosons
associated with spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry caused by the
underlying microscopic structure---the principle feature of which is a
transverse sound mode. At the linear, non-dissipative level, we verify that our
theory, based entirely on symmetry principles, is equivalent to a viscoelastic
theory. We then build a simple holographic dual of such a state containing
dynamical gravity and two two-form gauge fields, and use it to study its
hydrodynamic and higher-energy spectral properties characterised by
non-hydrodynamic, gapped modes. Based on the holographic analysis of transverse
two-point functions, we study consistency between low-energy predictions of the
bulk theory and the effective boundary theory. Various new features of the
holographic dictionary are explained in theories with higher-form symmetries,
such as the mixed-boundary-condition modification of the quasinormal mode
prescription that depends on the running coupling of the boundary double-trace
deformations. Furthermore, we examine details of low- and high-energy parts of
the spectrum that depend on temperature, line defect densities and the
renormalisation group scale.

\{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^d \to \{0,1\}$ that takes two inputs, a weak source $X
\sim \{0,1\}^n$ of min-entropy $k$ and an independent uniform seed $s \in
\{0,1\}^d$, and outputs a bit ${\sf nmExt}(X, s)$ that is $\varepsilon$-close
to uniform, even given the seed $s$ and the value ${\sf nmExt}(X, s')$ for an
adversarially chosen seed $s' \neq s$. Dodis and Wichs~(STOC 2009) showed the
existence of $(k, \varepsilon)$-non-malleable extractors with seed length $d =
\log(n-k-1) + 2\log(1/\varepsilon) + 6$ that support sources of entropy $k >
\log(d) + 2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + 8$.
  We show that the foregoing bound is essentially tight, by proving that any
$(k,\varepsilon)$-non-malleable extractor must satisfy the entropy bound $k >
\log(d) + 2 \log(1/\varepsilon) - \log\log(1/\varepsilon) - C$ for an absolute
constant $C$. In particular, this implies that non-malleable extractors require
min-entropy at least $\Omega(\log\log(n))$. This is in stark contrast to the
existence of strong seeded extractors that support sources of entropy $k =
O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$.
  Our techniques strongly rely on coding theory. In particular, we reveal an
inherent connection between non-malleable extractors and error correcting
codes, by proving a new lemma which shows that any
$(k,\varepsilon)$-non-malleable extractor with seed length $d$ induces a code
$C \subseteq \{0,1\}^{2^k}$ with relative distance $0.5 - 2\varepsilon$ and
rate $\frac{d-1}{2^k}$.

paper, we propose and demonstrate a new kind of super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy that can be easily implemented and requires neither additional
hardware nor complex post-processing. The microscopy is based on the principle
of stepwise optical saturation (SOS), where $M$ steps of raw fluorescence
images are linearly combined to generate an image with a $\sqrt{M}$-fold
increase in resolution compared with conventional diffraction-limited images.
For example, linearly combining (scaling and subtracting) two images obtained
at regular powers extends resolution by a factor of $1.4$ beyond the
diffraction limit. The resolution improvement in SOS microscopy is
theoretically infinite but practically is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio.
We perform simulations and experimentally demonstrate super-resolution
microscopy with both one-photon (confocal) and multiphoton excitation
fluorescence. We show that with the multiphoton modality, the SOS microscopy
can provide super-resolution imaging deep in scattering samples.

operation. In particular, a vertical structure cannot function as a vertical
junction as having been widely believed in the literature. Moreover, due to a
larger electrostatic screening, the bilayer region in the junction always has a
smaller band gap than its monolayer counterpart. As a result, a potential well,
aside from the usual potential barrier, will form universally in the bilayer
region to affect the hole or electron quantum transport in the form of
transmission or reflection. Taking black phosphorus as an example, we show that
an oscillation in the transmission coefficient can be clearly resolved in a

are characterized by an eigenvalue band structure in reciprocal space. Flat
band lattices have at least one of the bands completely dispersionless. Such
bands are coined flat bands. Flat bands occur in fine-tuned networks, and can
be protected by (e.g. chiral) symmetries. Recently a number of such systems
were realized in structured optical systems, exciton-polariton condensates, and
ultracold atomic gases. Flat band networks support compact localized modes.
Local defects couple these compact modes to dispersive states and generate Fano
resonances in the wave propagation. Disorder (i.e. a finite density of defects)
leads to a dense set of Fano defects, and to novel scaling laws in the
localization length of disordered dispersive states. Nonlinearities can
preserve the compactness of flat band modes, along with renormalizing (tuning)

oblique flow, which is crucial and challenging for the design and safe
operation of thruster driven vessel and dynamic positioning (DP) system. A
Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model has been first evaluated in the
quasi-steady investigation on a single ducted propeller operating in open water
condition, and then a hybrid RANS/LES model is adapted for the transient
sliding mesh computations. A representative test geometry considered here is a
marine model thruster which is discretized with structured hexahedral cells,
and the gap between the blade tip and nozzle is carefully meshed to capture the
flow dynamics. The computational results are assessed by a systematic grid
convergence study and compared with the available experimental data. As a part
of novel contribution, multiple incidence angles from $15^\circ$ to $60^\circ$
have been analyzed with varying advance coefficients. The main emphasis has
been placed on the hydrodynamic loads that act on the propeller blades and
nozzle as well as their variation with different configurations. The results
reveal that while the nozzle absorbs much effort from the oblique flow, the
imbalance between blades at different positions is still noticeable. Such
unbalance flow dynamics on the blades and the nozzle has a direct implication
on the variation of thrust and torque of a marine thruster.

the regularization term, a hybrid of the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_2$-norms, is
chosen so that the regularization preserves isotropy, in the sense that if the
observed random field is strongly isotropic then so too is the regularized
field. The Pareto efficient frontier is used to display the trade-off between
the sparsity-inducing norm and the data discrepancy term, in order to help in
the choice of a suitable regularization parameter. A numerical example using
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data is considered in detail. In particular,
the numerical results explore the trade-off between regularization and

ghost-like $1/(k^2-M_1^2)-1/(k^2-M_2^2)$ form, it would appear that such
theories have negative norm ghost states and are not unitary. However on
constructing the associated quantum Hilbert space for the free theory that
would produce such a propagator, Bender and Mannheim found that the Hamiltonian
of the free theory is not Hermitian but is instead $PT$ symmetric, and that
there are in fact no negative norm ghost states, with all Hilbert space norms
being both positive and preserved in time. Even though perturbative radiative
corrections cannot change the signature of a Hilbert space inner product,
nonetheless it is not immediately apparent how such a ghost-like propagator
would not then lead to negative probability contributions in loop diagrams.
Here we obtain the relevant Feynman rules and show that all states obtained in
cutting intermediate lines in loop diagrams have positive norm. Also we show
that due to the specific way that unitarity (conservation of probability) is
implemented in the theory, negative signatured discontinuities across cuts in
loop diagrams are cancelled by a novel and unanticipated contribution of the
states in which tree approximation (no loop) graphs are calculated, an effect
that is foreign to standard Hermitian theories. Perturbatively, the
fourth-order derivative theory is thus viable. The theory associated with the
pure massless $1/k^4$ propagator is equally shown to be perturbatively viable.

competing influences of thermal and non-thermal disorder lead to new phases and
non-trivial thermal behavior of order parameters. In this paper, we add a model
to the subject by considering a system where the state space consists of
various orderings of a list. As in spin glasses, the disorder of such
""permutation glasses"" arises from a parameter in the Hamiltonian being drawn
from a distribution of possible values, thus allowing nominally ""incorrect
orderings"" to have lower energies than ""correct orderings"" in the space of
permutations. We analyze a Gaussian, uniform, and symmetric Bernoulli
distribution of energy costs, and, by employing Jensen's inequality, derive a
general condition requiring the permutation glass to always transition to the
correctly ordered state at a temperature lower than that of the non-disordered
system, provided that this correctly ordered state is accessible. We in turn
find that in order for the correctly ordered state to be accessible, the
probability that an incorrectly-ordered component is energetically favored must
be less than the inverse of the number of components in the system. We show
that all of these results are consistent with a replica symmetric ansatz of the
system and argue that there is no permutation glass phase characterized by
replica symmetry breaking, but there is glassy behavior represented by a
residual entropy at zero temperature. We conclude by discussing an apparent
duality between permutation glasses and fermion gases.

build more accurate worker models for task completion that captures the

operations using Yao's Garbled Circuits or the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson

secret sharing models where three or more parties need to communicate in the
online phase: the framework allows two parties with private inputs to
communicate in the online phase under the assumption of a third node generating
correlated randomness in an offline phase. Almost all of the heavy
cryptographic operations are precomputed in an offline phase which
substantially reduces the communication overhead. Chameleon is both scalable

Chameleon's vector dot product of signed fixed-point numbers improves the

the group velocities of sound and the interatomic distance. This formalism was
previously applied to the specific heat of condensed matter and predicted its
fourth power of temperature behaviour at sufficiently low temperatures, which
was tested by experimental data for diamond lattice materials. The range of
temperatures with the quartic law varies for different materials, therefore, it
is called the quasi-low temperature regime. The quasi-low temperature behavior
of specific heat is verified here with experimental data for the fcc lattice
materials, silver chloride and lithium iodide. The conjecture that the fourth
order behavior is universal for all condensed matter systems is also supported

the bcc solid helium-4. The characteristic temperatures of the threshold of the
quasi-low temperature regime are found for the studied materials. The scaling
in the specific heat of condensed matter is expressed by the dimensionless

stochasticity of the GAN is still a challenge. We propose a novel denoising
framework to handle this problem. The overlapped objects generation is another
challenging task when synthesizing images from a semantic layout to a realistic
RGB photo. To overcome this deficiency, we include a one-hot semantic label map
to force the generator paying more attention on the overlapped objects
generation. Furthermore, we improve the loss function of the discriminator by
considering perturb loss and cascade layer loss to guide the generation
process. We applied our methods on the Cityscapes, Facades and NYU datasets and
demonstrate the image generation ability of our model.

$(Y,D_Y)$, and a positive integer $d$. The objective is to determine whether
there is an embedding $F:X \rightarrow Y$ such that $d_{F} \leq d$, where
$d_{F}$ denotes the distortion of the map $F$. Such an embedding is called a
distortion $d$ embedding. The bijective Metric Embedding problem is a special
case of the Metric Embedding problem where $|X| = |Y|$. In parameterized
complexity, the Metric Embedding problem, in full generality, is known to be
W-hard and therefore, not expected to have an FPT algorithm. In this paper, we
consider the Gen-Graph Metric Embedding problem, where the two metric spaces
are graph metrics. We explore the extent of tractability of the problem in the
parameterized complexity setting. We determine whether an unweighted graph
metric $(G,D_G)$ can be embedded, or bijectively embedded, into another
unweighted graph metric $(H,D_H)$, where the graph $H$ has low structural
complexity. For example, $H$ is a cycle, or $H$ has bounded treewidth or
bounded connected treewidth. The parameters for the algorithms are chosen from
the upper bound $d$ on distortion, bound $\Delta$ on the maximum degree of $H$,
treewidth $\alpha$ of $H$, and the connected treewidth $\alpha_{c}$ of $H$.
  Our general approach to these problems can be summarized as trying to
understand the behavior of the shortest paths in $G$ under a low distortion
embedding into $H$, and the structural relation the mapping of these paths has
to shortest paths in $H$.

arbitrarily large and demonstrate our approach on two case studies from

For such a network, letting all $L$ users transmit simultaneously, especially

Therefore, in each transmission phase only a fixed number of users should

broken time ($\mathcal{T}$) and parity ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetries by performing
calculations of band structures, Berry curvatures, Chern numbers, edge states
and also numerical simulations of light propagation in the edge modes.
Specifically, we consider a hexagonal lattice consisting of triangular
gyromagnetic rods. Here the gyromagnetic material breaks $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry
while the triangular rods breaks $\mathcal{P}$ symmetry. Interestingly, we find
that the crystal could host quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases with different
gap Chern numbers ($C_g$) including $|C_g| > 1$ as well as quantum valley Hall
(QVH) phases with contrasting valley Chern numbers ($C_v$), depending on the
orientation of the triangular rods. Furthermore, phase transitions among these
topological phases, such as from QAH to QVH and vice versa, can be engineered
by a simple rotation of the rods. Our band theoretical analyses reveal that the
Dirac nodes at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in the momentum space are produced and
protected by the mirror symmetry ($m_y$) instead of the $\mathcal{P}$ symmetry,
and they become gapped when either $\mathcal{T}$ or $m_y$ symmetry is broken,
resulting in a QAH or QVH phase, respectively. Moreover, a high Chern number
($C_g = -2$) QAH phase is generated by gapping triply degenerate nodal points
rather than pairs of Dirac points by breaking $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Our
proposed photonic crystal thus provides a platform for investigating intriguing
topological phenomena which may be challenging to realize in electronic
systems, and also has promising potentials for device applications in photonics
such as reflection-free one-way waveguides and topological photonic circuits.

conductivity, high in the ionised metallic hydrogen region, low in the
molecular outer region. Our suite of electrical conductivity profiles ranges
from Jupiter-like, where the outer hydrodynamic region is quite thin, to
Saturn-like, where there is a thick non-conducting shell. The rapid rotation
leads to the formation of two distinct dynamical regimes which are separated by
a magnetic tangent cylinder - mTC. Outside the mTC there are strong zonal
flows, where Reynolds stress balances turbulent viscosity, but inside the mTC
Lorentz force reduces the zonal flow. The dynamic interaction between both
regions induces meridional circulation. We find a rich diversity of magnetic
field morphologies. There are Jupiter-like steady dipolar fields, and a belt of
quadrupolar dominated dynamos spanning the range of models between Jupiter-like
and Saturn-like conductivity profiles. This diversity may be linked to the
appearance of reversed sign helicity in the metallic regions of our dynamos.
With Saturn-like conductivity profiles we find models with dipolar magnetic
fields, whose axisymmetric components resemble those of Saturn, and which
oscillate on a very long time-scale. However, the non-axisymmetric field
components of our models are at least ten times larger than those of Saturn,
possibly due to the absence of any stably stratified layer.

compensated ferrimagnet with a vanishing net magnetic moment and a Curie
temperature of over 650 K. Despite the vanishing net magnetic moment, we
calculate a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of about 300 S/cm. It
derives from the Berry curvature distribution of the Weyl points, which are
only 14 meV away from the Fermi level and isolated from trivial bands.
Different from antiferromagnets Mn3X (X= Ge, Sn, Ga, Ir, Rh, and Pt), where the
AHE originates from the non-collinear magnetic structure, the AHE in Ti2MnAl
stems directly from the Weyl points and is topologically protected. The large
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) together with a low charge carrier
concentration should give rise to a large anomalous Hall angle. In contrast to
the Co-based ferromagnetic Heusler compounds, the Weyl nodes in Ti2MnAl do not
derive from nodal lines due to the lack of mirror symmetries in the inverse
Heusler structure. Since the magnetic structure breaks spin-rotation symmetry,
the Weyl nodes are stable without SOC. Moreover, because of the large
separation between Weyl points of opposite topological charge, the Fermi arcs
extent up to 75% of the reciprocal lattice vectors in length. This makes
Ti2MnAl an excellent candidate for the comprehensive study of magnetic Weyl
semimetals. It is the first example of a material with Weyl points, large
anomalous Hall effect and angle despite a vanishing net magnetic moment.

three metal-poor benchmark stars, HD 140283, HD 122563, and HD 103095, from

stars were determined from observations with the PAVO beam combiner at visible

with the VEGA instrument, also at the CHARA array. Together with
photometrically derived bolometric fluxes, the angular diameters give a direct
measurement of the effective temperature. For HD 140283 we find {\theta}_LD =

applications, long delays between heralding and single-photon readout are
crucial. Until now, this has been prevented in room-temperature atomic systems
by fast decoherence due to thermal motion. Here we demonstrate efficient
heralding and readout of single collective excitations created in warm caesium
vapour. Using the principle of motional averaging we achieve a collective
excitation lifetime of $0.27\pm 0.04$ ms, two orders of magnitude larger than
previously achieved for single excitations in room-temperature sources. We
experimentally verify non-classicality of the light-matter correlations by

increases in the amount of transmitted sensor data related to massive

as mobile sensors will become important data sources for cloud-based
applications like predictive maintenance and dynamic traffic forecast. Due to
the limitation of available communication resources, it is expected that the
grows in Machine-Type Communication (MTC) will cause severe interference with
Human-to-human (H2H) communication. Consequently, more efficient transmission
methods are highly required. In this paper, we present a probabilistic scheme
for efficient transmission of vehicular sensor data which leverages favorable
channel conditions and avoids transmissions when they are expected to be highly
resource-consuming. Multiple variants of the proposed scheme are evaluated in
comprehensive realworld experiments. Through machine learning based combination
of multiple context metrics, the proposed scheme is able to achieve up to 164%
higher average data rate values for sensor applications with soft deadline

Fermi level is observed in both experiment and theory. For the physical origin
of this peak two mechanisms were proposed. A single particle dz2 surface state
renormalised by electron-phonon coupling and an orbital Kondo effect due to the
degenerate dxz/dyz states. Despite several experimental and theoretical
investigations, the origin is still under debate. In this work we address this
problem by two different approaches of the dynamical mean-field theory. First,
by the spin-polarized T-matrix fluctuation exchange approximation suitable for
weakly and moderately correlated systems. Second, by the non-crossing
approximation derived in the limit of weak hybridization (i.e. for strongly
correlated systems) capturing Kondo-like processes. By using recent
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations as a benchmark, we find that
the high-energy features, everything except the resonance, of the spectrum is
captured within the spin-polarized T-matrix fluctuation exchange approximation.
More precisely the particle-particle processes provide the main contribution.
For the non-crossing approximation it appears that spin-polarized calculations
suffer from spurious behavior at the Fermi level. Then, we turned to non
spin-polarized calculations to avoid this unphysical behavior. By employing two
plausible starting hybridization functions, it is observed that the
characteristics of the resonance are crucially dependent on the starting point.
It appears that only one of these starting hybridizations could result in an
orbital Kondo resonance in the presence of a strong magnetic field like in the
Cr(001) surface. It is for a future investigation to first resolve the
unphysical behavior within the spin-polarized non-crossing approximation and
then check for an orbital Kondo resonance.

holes in the radio regime. Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are
an integral part of current astrophysics and are at the center of attempts to
unify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever seen a black
hole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an
academic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.
Observations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black
hole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy
emission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the
event horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which
could be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast
to earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due
to a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of
the event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is
attempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved
by adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa.
Ultimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could
produce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical
simulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of
pulsars - these images will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented
precision.

incomplete data tensors. It being actively studied based on the convex
optimization scheme such as nuclear-norm minimization. When given data tensors
include some noises, the nuclear-norm minimization problem is usually converted
to the nuclear-norm `regularization' problem which simultaneously minimize
penalty and error terms with some trade-off parameter. However, the good value
of trade-off is not easily determined because of the difference of two units
and the data dependence. In the sense of trade-off tuning, the noisy tensor
completion problem with the `noise inequality constraint' is better choice than
the `regularization' because the good noise threshold can be easily bounded
with noise standard deviation. In this study, we tackle to solve the convex
tensor completion problems with two types of noise inequality constraints:
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. The contributions of this study are
follows: (1) New tensor completion and denoising models using tensor total
variation and nuclear-norm are proposed which can be characterized as a
generalization/extension of many past matrix and tensor completion models, (2)
proximal mappings for noise inequalities are derived which are analytically
computable with low computational complexity, (3) convex optimization algorithm
is proposed based on primal-dual splitting framework, (4) new step-size
adaptation method is proposed to accelerate the optimization, and (5) extensive
experiments demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method for visual data

between the inputs. However, as there is dependence in many application
studies, that enhances the development of interpretable sensitivity indices.
Recently, the Shapley values developed in the field of cooperative games theory
have been connected to global sensitivity analysis and present good properties
in the presence of dependencies. Nevertheless, the available estimation methods
don't always provide confidence intervals and require a large number of model
evaluation. In this paper, we implement a bootstrap sampling in the existing
algorithms to estimate confidence intervals of the indice estimations. We also
proposed to consider a metamodel in substitution of a costly numerical model.
The estimation error from the Monte-Carlo sampling is combined with the

surface Debye frequency for the fit of the experimental data. More precisely,
then experimentally an electron-phonon mass-enhancement factor of 0.70~0.10 is
obtained, which is not in agreement with our calculated values of 0.19 and

normal nor zero-centered, these error statistics cannot be used to infer
prediction error probabilities. To overcome this limitation, we advocate for
the use of more informative statistics, based on the empirical cumulative
distribution function of unsigned errors, namely (1) the probability for a new

maximal amplitude of errors one can expect with a chosen high confidence level.

many theoretical complexities in these theories, on phenomenological grounds,
the implications of massive gravity have been widely used to put bounds on
graviton mass. One of the generic implications of giving a mass to the graviton
is that the gravitational potential will follow a Yukawa-like fall off. We use
this feature of massive gravity theories to probe the mass of graviton by using
the largest gravitationally bound objects, namely galaxy clusters. In this
work, we use the mass estimates of galaxy clusters measured at various
cosmologically defined radial distances measured via weak lensing (WL) and
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We also use the model independent values of
Hubble parameter $H(z)$ smoothed by a non-parametric method, Gaussian process.
Within $1\sigma$ confidence region, we obtain the mass of graviton $m_g < 5.9
\times 10^{-30}$ eV with the corresponding Compton length scale $\lambda_g >
6.82$ Mpc from weak lensing and $m_g < 8.31 \times 10^{-30}$ eV with $\lambda_g
> 5.012$ Mpc from SZ effect. This analysis improves the upper bound on graviton
mass obtained earlier from galaxy clusters.

by a comprehensive study involving electric-field and temperature dependent
XRD, Raman spectroscopy, dielectric, piezoelectric and high field electrostrain
measurements. We found that poling-field irreversibly suppresses the cubic-like
phase at room temperature. Based on our results, we argue that that which
appears as MPB, comprising of tetragonal and cubic-like phases on the global
scale, is not so actually. The large piezoresponse is due to coexistence of
tetragonal regions of long and short-range coherence. The PT-BNZ system is
therefore qualitatively different from the conventional MPB systems such as
PZT, PMN-PT, and PbTiO3-BiScO3, etc., which exhibits coexisting tetragonal and
rhombohedral/monoclinic phases in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the absence of
inter-ferroelectric instability as a phenomenon, field induced
polarization-rotation and inter-ferroelectric transformation are no longer
plausible mechanisms to explain the large piezoelectric response in PT-BNZ. The
large piezoelectricity is primarily due to enhanced mobility of the tetragonal
domain walls enabled by domain miniaturization. Our study proves that
attainment of large piezoelectricity does not require inter-ferroelectric
instability as a necessary criterion.

induced interlayer asymmetry can provide one with ballistic channels for
electrons with energies inside the electrostatically induced BLG gap. These
channels are formed by a combination of valley-polarised evanescent states
propagating along the delamination edges (which persist in the presence of a
strong magnetic field) and standing waves bouncing between them inside the
delaminated region (in a strong magnetic field, these transform into Landau
levels in the monolayers). For inverted stacking between BLGs on the left and
right of the delamination (AB-2ML-BA or BA-2ML-AB), the lowest energy ballistic
channels are gapless, have linear dispersion and appear to be weakly
topologically protected. When BLG stacking order on both sides of the
delamination is the same (AB-2ML-AB or BA-2ML-BA), the lowest energy ballistic
channels are gapped, with gap $\varepsilon_g$ scaling as $\varepsilon_g\propto
W^{-1}$ with delamination width and as $\varepsilon_g\propto\delta^{-1}$ with
the on-layer energy difference within the delamination. Depending on their
width, delaminations may also support several `higher energy' waveguide modes.
Our results are based on both an analytical study of the wavematching of Dirac
states and tight binding model calculations, and we analyse in detail the

establish such models and present a novel neural network architecture for the
task of weakly supervised one-shot detection. Our model is only conditioned on
a single exemplar of an unseen class and a larger target example that may or
may not contain an instance of the same class as the exemplar. By pairing a
Siamese similarity network with an attention mechanism, we design a model that
manages to simultaneously identify and localise instances of classes unseen at
training time. In experiments with datasets from the computer vision and audio
domains, the proposed method considerably outperforms the baseline methods for
the weakly supervised one-shot detection task.

lead to magnetic reconnections and to acceleration of electrons that produce
synchrotron emission from the optical to X-ray bands, and inverse Compton
scattering into the GeV range. For the origin of the twin peaks we discuss two
possibilities: a single-jet model, based on added instabilities induced in j_1
by the smaller companion BH on its inner orbital arc; and a two-jet model with
the smaller BH supporting its own, precessing jet j_2 that contributes lower,
specific GeV emissions. Such behaviors combining time stability with amplitude
variations betray plasma instabilities driven in either jet by binary dynamics,

(Bethe lattice), which is well-known to undergo a phase transition in the
absence of an external magnetic field. The behavior of the model at critical
temperature can be described in terms of various critical exponents; one of
them is the critical 1-arm exponent $\rho$, which characterizes the rate of
decay of the (root) magnetization. The crucial quantity we analyze in this work
is the thermal expectation of the root spin on a finite subtree, where the
expected value is taken with respect to a probability measure related to the
corresponding finite-volume Hamiltonian with a fixed boundary condition. The
spontaneous magnetization, which is the limit of this thermal expectation in
the distance between the root and the boundary (i.e. in the height of the
subtree), is known to vanish at criticality. We are interested in a
quantitative analysis of the rate of this convergence in terms of the critical
1-arm exponent $\rho$. Therefore, we rigorously prove that
$\langle\sigma_0\rangle^+_n$, the thermal expectation of the root spin at the
critical temperature and in the presence of the positive boundary condition,
decays as $\langle\sigma_0\rangle^+_n\approx n^{-1/2}$ (in a rather sharp
sense), where $n$ is the height of the tree. This establishes the 1-arm
critical exponent for the Ising model on regular trees ($\rho=1/2$).

measurement campaigns show that wireless propagation at mmW carrier frequencies
is only marginally worse than propagation at sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies for
small-cell coverage --- one of the most important use-cases for 5G-NR. On the
other hand, the biggest determinants of viability of mmW systems in practice
are penetration and blockage of mmW signals through different materials in the
scattering environment. With this background, the focus of this paper is on
understanding the impact of blockage of mmW signals and reduced spatial
coverage due to penetration through the human hand, body, vehicles, etc.
Leveraging measurements with a 28 GHz mmW experimental prototype and
electromagnetic simulation studies, we first propose statistical blockage
models to capture the impact of the hand, human body and vehicles. We then
study the time-scales at which mmW signals are disrupted by blockage (hand and
human body). Our results show that these events can be attributed to physical
movements and the time-scales corresponding to blockage are hence on the order
of a few 100 ms or more. Building on this fundamental understanding, we finally
consider the broader question of robustness of mmW beamforming to handle
blockage. Network densification, subarray switching in a user equipment (UE)
designed with multiple subarrays, fall back mechanisms such as codebook
enhancements and switching to legacy carriers in non-standalone deployments,
etc. can address blockage before it leads to a deleterious impact on the mmW

information on the processes that participate in the dynamical heating of their
disc components (e.g. giant molecular clouds, mergers, spiral density waves,
bars). Earlier findings suggested a strong relation between the shape of the
disc SVE and Hubble type, with later-type galaxies displaying more anisotropic
ellipsoids and early-types being more isotropic. In this paper, we revisit the
strength of this relation using an exhaustive compilation of observational
results from the literature on this issue. We find no clear correlation between
the shape of the disc SVE and morphological type, and show that galaxies with
the same Hubble type display a wide range of vertical-to-radial velocity
dispersion ratios. The points are distributed around a mean value and scatter
of $\sigma_z/\sigma_R=0.7\pm 0.2$. With the aid of numerical simulations, we
argue that different mechanisms might influence the shape of the SVE in the
same manner and that the same process (e.g. mergers) does not have the same
impact in all the galaxies. The complexity of the observational picture is
confirmed by these simulations, which suggest that the vertical-to-radial axis
ratio of the SVE is not a good indicator of the main source of disc heating.
Our analysis of those simulations also indicates that the observed shape of the
disc SVE may be affected by several processes simultaneously and that the
signatures of some of them (e.g. mergers) fade over time.

exactly this needs to be done remains an open question. Various proposals have
been put on the table, such as canonical quantum gravity, loop quantum gravity,
string theory, etc. These proposals often encounter technical and conceptual
problems. In this chapter, we focus on canonical quantum gravity and discuss
how many conceptual problems, such as the measurement problem and the problem
of time, can be overcome by adopting a Bohmian point of view. In a Bohmian
theory (also called pilot-wave theory or de Broglie-Bohm theory, after its
originators de Broglie and Bohm), a system is described by certain variables in
space-time such as particles or fields or something else, whose dynamics
depends on the wave function. In the context of quantum gravity, these
variables are a space-time metric and suitable variable for the matter fields
(e.g., particles or fields). In addition to solving the conceptual problems,
the Bohmian approach yields new applications and predictions in quantum
cosmology. These include space-time singularity resolution, new types of
semi-classical approximations to quantum gravity, and approximations for
quantum perturbations moving in a quantum background.

triads play a prominent role in a number of inconsistency indices, our results
can also contribute to the measurement of inconsistency for pairwise comparison

interacting with such smart contracts as the basic and canonical quantitative
property for such contracts. We present a framework for such quantitative

analyzed in the security community, their analysis has been restricted to the
very special case of stateless games. However, to analyze smart contracts,
stateful analysis is required as it must account for the different program
states of the protocol. Our main contributions are as follows: we present (i)~a
simplified programming language for smart contracts; (ii)~an automatic
translation of the programs to state-based games; (iii)~an

code (MRC) can correct all erasure patterns that are information-theoretically
correctable. In a grid-like topology, there are $a$ local constraints in every
column forming a column code, $b$ local constraints in every row forming a row
code, and $h$ global constraints in an $(m \times n)$ grid of codeword.
Recently, Gopalan et al. initiated the study of MRCs under grid-like topology,
and derived a necessary and sufficient condition, termed as the regularity
condition, for an erasure pattern to be recoverable when $a=1, h=0$.
  In this paper, we consider MRCs for product topology ($h=0$). First, we
construct a certain bipartite graph based on the erasure pattern satisfying the
regularity condition for product topology (any $a, b$, $h=0$) and show that
there exists a complete matching in this graph. We then present an alternate
direct proof of the sufficient condition when $a=1, h=0$. We later extend our
technique to study the topology for $a=2, h=0$, and characterize a subset of
recoverable erasure patterns in that case. For both $a=1, 2$, our method of
proof is uniform, i.e., by constructing tensor product $G_{\text{col}} \otimes
G_{\text{row}}$ of generator matrices of column and row codes such that certain
square sub-matrices retain full rank. The full-rank condition is proved by
resorting to the matching identified earlier and also another set of matchings
in erasure sub-patterns.

realistic gap opening criteria, we find that gaps open only rarely which
strongly affects clump survival rates and their physical properties (mass,
radius and radial distance). The inferred surviving population is then shifted
towards less massive clumps at smaller radial distances. We also find that
populations of surviving clumps are very sensitive to the model assumptions and
used parameters. Depending on the chosen parameters, the protoplanets occupy a
mass range between 0.01 and 16 $M_{\text{J}}$ and may either orbit close to the
central star or as far out as 75 AU, with a sweet spot at 10-30 AU for the

that the RGBB luminosity depends on the stellar chemical composition and that
the 2G RGBB is consistent with stars enhanced in He and N and depleted in C and

time $n$ is separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances
between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$,

and $n+m$. The squared rest energy $\epsilon_{0}^{2}$ is proportional to the
eigenvalue $\tilde{\sigma}$ that describes a 'stationary state'
$\Psi(r_{4},\sigma)=\psi(r_{4},\tilde{\sigma})e^{i\tilde{\sigma}\sigma}$. The
Dirac equation follows as a `square root' of the stationary state equation from
the condition that $\tilde{\sigma}>0$, which follows from the directed nature
of $n$. The formalism thus implies that all observable objects have non-zero
rest mass, including elementary fermions. The introduction of $n$ releases $t$,
so that it can be treated as an observable with uncertainty $\Delta t$.

  multiplicative calculus I: Theoretical considerations",,,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The multiplicative (or geometric) calculus is a non-Newtonian calculus
derived from an arithmetic in which the operations of
addition/subtraction/multiplication are replaced by
multiplication/division/exponentiation. A major difference between the
multiplicative calculus and the classical additive calculus, and one that has
important consequences in the simulation of wave propagation problems, is that
in geometric calculus the role of polynomials is played by exponentials of a
polynomial argument. For example, whereas a polynomial of degree one has
constant (classical) derivative, it is the exponential function that has
constant derivative in the multiplicative calculus. As we will show, this
implies that even low-order finite quotient approximations|the analogues of
finite differences in the multiplicative calculus|produce exact multiplicative
derivatives of exponential functions. We exploit this fact to show that some
partial differential equations (PDE) can be solved far more efficiently using
techniques based on the multiplicative calculus. For wave propagation models in
particular, we will show that it is possible to circumvent the
minimum-points-per-wavelength sampling constraints of classical methods. In
this first part we develop the theoretical framework for studying
multiplicative partial differential equations and their connections with
classical models.

background of statistical mechanics at the end of the XIX - beginning of the XX
century and were then explored in mathematics of the XX-XXI centuries. At the
beginning of the XXI century, it became clear that the proper utilisation of
these phenomena in machine learning might transform the curse of dimensionality
into the blessing of dimensionality.
  This paper summarises recently discovered phenomena of measure concentration
which drastically simplify some machine learning problems in high dimension,
and allow us to correct legacy artificial intelligence systems. The classical
concentration of measure theorems state that i.i.d. random points are
concentrated in a thin layer near a surface (a sphere or equators of a sphere,
an average or median level set of energy or another Lipschitz function, etc.).
  The new stochastic separation theorems describe the thin structure of these
thin layers: the random points are not only concentrated in a thin layer but
are all linearly separable from the rest of the set, even for exponentially
large random sets. The linear functionals for separation of points can be
selected in the form of the linear Fisher's discriminant.
  All artificial intelligence systems make errors. Non-destructive correction
requires separation of the situations (samples) with errors from the samples
corresponding to correct behaviour by a simple and robust classifier. The
stochastic separation theorems provide us by such classifiers and a
non-iterative (one-shot) procedure for learning.

and short-term exploitation. However, as has recently been noted, in settings
in which the choices of the learning algorithm correspond to important
decisions about individual people (such as criminal recidivism prediction,
lending, and sequential drug trials), exploration corresponds to explicitly
sacrificing the well-being of one individual for the potential future benefit
of others. This raises a fairness concern. In such settings, one might like to
run a ""greedy"" algorithm, which always makes the (myopically) optimal decision
for the individuals at hand - but doing this can result in a catastrophic
failure to learn. In this paper, we consider the linear contextual bandit
problem and revisit the performance of the greedy algorithm. We give a smoothed
analysis, showing that even when contexts may be chosen by an adversary, small
perturbations of the adversary's choices suffice for the algorithm to achieve
""no regret"", perhaps (depending on the specifics of the setting) with a
constant amount of initial training data. This suggests that ""generically""
(i.e. in slightly perturbed environments), exploration and exploitation need
not be in conflict in the linear setting.

for the viscosity variation between phases and the latent heat of fusion at the
phase interface.
  The resulting coupled system of PDE's can be solved by a single-domain
semi-phase-field, variable viscosity, finite element method with monolithic
system coupling and global Newton linearization. A robust computational model
for realistic phase-change regimes furthermore requires a flexible
implementation based on sophisticated mesh adaptivity. In this article, we
present first steps towards implementing such a computational model into a
simulation tool which we call Phaseflow.
  Phaseflow utilizes the finite element software FEniCS, which includes a
dual-weighted residual method for goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement.
Phaseflow is an open-source, dimension-independent implementation that, upon an
appropriate parameter choice, reduces to classical benchmark situations

metallic, indirect band gap semiconducting (band gap $ \sim$ 90 meV) and
semi-metallic ground state, respectively. On studying the band structures while
going across the series Cr-Co, the occupied bands around the Fermi level are
getting narrower while the unoccupied bands are getting wider. Similarly, band
edge in partial density of states is shifting away from the Fermi level due to
increased hybridizations. The effective mass of holes for FeSi is found to be
much larger than that of electrons, giving rise to positive Seebeck coefficient
and negative Hall coefficient, which is consistent with experimental results.
For different ionic states of 3\textit{d}-metal, the values of
$\textit{$U_{eff}$}$ and $\textit{J}$ are evaluated by using constrained DFT
method. $\textit{$U_{eff}$}$ ($\textit{J}$) for $2^{+} $ ionic state across the

$\sim $ 4.4 eV ($\sim $ 0.82 eV) and $\sim $ 4.5 eV ($\sim $ 0.87 eV).
$\lambda$ and $\textit{J}$ are also calculated by considering Yukawa form of

First, we took into account the experimental evidence that at temperatures
below 50 K, the crystal structure of PdH and of PdD is zincblende. Second, we
take into account not only the influence of the electron-phonon interaction but
also the electron-electron interaction contribution to the isotope coeffiecient
due tothe replacement of deuterium in the place of hydrogen. We used the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory to perform our ab initio calculations. We found in
this picture that the electron-electron interaction is considerably reduced by
the isotope substitution and is the most important factor to explain the
inverse isotope effect. We found $\Delta T_c^{total}=2.224\:K$ and $\alpha=
-0.3134$ in excellent agreement with the values found experimentally.

  This work's hypothesis is that general, informative features can be learned
from the large amounts of data generated by aggregating the signals of multiple
users, thus reducing the recording burden while enhancing gesture recognition.
Consequently, this paper proposes applying transfer learning on aggregated data
from multiple users, while leveraging the capacity of deep learning algorithms
to learn discriminant features from large datasets. Two datasets comprised of
19 and 17 able-bodied participants respectively (the first one is employed for
pre-training) were recorded for this work, using the Myo Armband. A third Myo
Armband dataset was taken from the NinaPro database and is comprised of 10
able-bodied participants. Three different deep learning networks employing
three different modalities as input (raw EMG, Spectrograms and Continuous
Wavelet Transform (CWT)) are tested on the second and third dataset. The
proposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly
enhance the performance for all three networks on the two datasets, achieving
an offline accuracy of 98.31% for 7 gestures over 17 participants for the
CWT-based ConvNet and 68.98% for 18 gestures over 10 participants for the raw

Salapaka","Designing Memory Bits with Dissipation lower than the Landauer's Bound",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Brownian particle in a symmetric double well potential is used as a
representation for a single bit memory, where, the location of the particle in
either well denotes one of the two states of a single bit memory. This article
analyzes the effect of modifications to a symmetric double well potential on
the minimum heat dissipation associated with erasure of the information stored
in a single bit memory. Two types of modifications are considered, viz.,
overlap between the two wells and the asymmetry between the two wells of a bit
of memory. Moreover, the analysis presented here, takes into account the
uncertainty in the success of the erasure process. We quantify the effect of
the proposed modifications on the heat dissipation accompanying erasure of a
bit of information with a comparison to the Landauer's bound. In particular, we
conclude that the proposed modifications could result in the minimum heat
dissipation being lower than the Landauer's bound in quasi-static erasure
processes. Furthermore, we quantify the physical aspect ratio for designing a
memory bit which could improve memory density.

"1802.02099","Saeed Zamanzad Gavidel PhD Candidate","Saeed Z. Gavidel, J. L. Rickli","Triage strategies for agile core sorting in extreme value scenarios","13 pages, 7 Figures and 7 Tables",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surveys have indicated that the remanufacturing industry is concerned about
the necessity of agile and prioritized core sorting due to its potential
benefits to optimal core inventory and condition assessment, both at equipment
and component levels. As such, core sorting holds a pivotal role in generalized
remanufacturing operations, however, extreme value core arrivals, its
stochastic nature and resulting sorting issues warrant targeted modelling and
analysis. This paper is devoted to triage as an agile and quality-based sorting
strategy in extreme value scenarios, which can be utilized as a complementary
core sorting strategy. A statistical model of extreme core arrivals is
developed based on Extreme Value (EV) theory and related Generalized Extreme
Value (GEV) and Fr\'echet (Fisher-Tippett type-II) distributions. The model is
applied to extreme arrivals of valves in an industrial valve repair shop in
order to formulate extreme arrival sorting strategies. Using a large sample
size, distribution parameters are estimated and the stochastic behaviour of the
extreme valve arrivals is evaluated and verified. A generic analogy between
medical triage and remanufacturing triage is discussed, because triage can be
used to address extreme core arrivals, associated statistical distributions,
and their effect on core condition assessment in order to enhance management of
unpredictable consequences of extreme core arrivals.
