properties of financial systems. The analysis of the structure of investment
portfolios is a major application since their eventual correlation and overlap
impact the actual risk diversification by individual investors. We investigate
the bipartite network of US mutual fund portfolios and their assets. We follow
its evolution during the Global Financial Crisis and analyse the interplay
between diversification, as understood in classical portfolio theory, and
similarity of the investments of different funds. We show that, on average,
portfolios have become more diversified and less similar during the crisis.
However, we also find that large overlap is far more likely than expected from
models of random allocation of investments. This indicates the existence of
strong correlations between fund portfolio strategies. We introduce a
simplified model of propagation of financial shocks, that we exploit to show
that a systemic risk component origins from the similarity of portfolios. The
network is still vulnerable after crisis because of this effect, despite the
increase in the diversification of portfolios. Our results indicate that
diversification may even increase systemic risk when funds diversify in the
same way. Diversification and similarity can play antagonistic roles and the
trade-off between the two should be taken into account to properly assess
systemic risk.

in the environment have to be taken under consideration via different level of

background subtraction. Several methods have been proposed in this domain.
However, they lack the ability of handling various difficult scenarios such as
illumination changes, background or camera motion, camouflage effect, shadow
etc. To address these issues, we propose a robust and flexible encoder-decoder
type neural network based approach. We adapt a pre-trained convolutional
network, i.e. VGG-16 Net, under a triplet framework in the encoder part to
embed an image in multiple scales into the feature space and use a transposed
convolutional network in the decoder part to learn a mapping from feature space
to image space. We train this network end-to-end by using only a few training
samples. Our network takes an RGB image in three different scales and produces
a foreground segmentation probability mask for the corresponding image. In
order to evaluate our model, we entered the Change Detection 2014 Challenge
(changedetection.net) and our method outperformed all the existing
state-of-the-art methods by an average F-Measure of 0.9770. Our source code

  Generative Models","14 pages, 4 figures, AISTATS2018",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new technique that boosts the convergence of training generative
adversarial networks. Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces
severely after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a
deep network is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model,
and thus the parameter gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods
often suffer not only from degeneration of the convergence speed but also from
limitations in the representational power of the trained network. To overcome
this issue, we propose an additional layer called the gradient layer to seek a
descent direction in an infinite-dimensional space. Because the layer is
constructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are not restricted by the
specific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As a result, we can get
out of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move towards the
global optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon is
explained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient
layer. Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer
naturally constructs the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this procedure can be regarded as a discretization method of
the gradient flow that naturally reduces the objective function. Finally, the
method is tested using several numerical experiments, which show its fast
convergence.

analyzed, in which infinitely many nodes are initially placed on R^2 according

direction at time instances that form a Poisson process, each time selecting a
new travel direction from an arbitrary distribution; all nodes maintain
constant speed. A single information packet is traveling towards a given

according to a member of a broad class of possible routing rules. For this
model, we compute the long-term averages of the speed with which the packet
travels towards its destination and the rate with which the wireless
transmission cost accumulates. Because of the complexity of the problem, we
employ two intuitive, simplifying approximations; simulations verify that the
approximation error is typically small. Our results quantify the fundamental
trade-off that exists in mobile wireless DTNs between the packet speed and the

population of roughly a third. We also see a population of AGN that challenge
the inclination based unification model with individual dust covering factors

ratios. We see no strong connection between AGN fractions in the IR and

field, which suppresses the spin-orbit induced hybridization of $J_{\text{eff}}

radial acceleration in disk galaxies and the acceleration predicted on the
basis of baryonic matter alone. Here we study this relation within the
framework of the modified gravity model MOND. The field equations of MOND
automatically imply the radial acceleration relation for spherically symmetric
galaxies, but for disk galaxies deviations from the relation are expected. Here
we investigate whether these deviations are of sufficient magnitude to bring
MOND into conflict with the observed relation. In the quasilinear formulation
of MOND, to calculate the gravitational field of a given distribution of
matter, an intermediate step is to calculate the ""pristine field"", which is a
simple nonlinear function of the Newtonian field corresponding to the same
distribution of matter. Hence, to the extent that the quasilinear gravitational
field is approximately equal to the pristine field, the radial acceleration
relation will be satisfied. We show that the difference between the quasilinear
and pristine fields obeys the equations of magnetostatics, the curl of the
pristine field serves as the source for the difference in the two fields, much
as currents serve as sources for the magnetic field. Using the magnetostatic
analogy we numerically study the difference between the pristine and
quasilinear fields for simple model galaxies with a Gaussian profile. Our
principal finding is that the difference between the fields is small compared
to the observational uncertainties and that quasilinear MOND is therefore
compatible with the observed radial acceleration relation.

$p$ positive, we say that $G$ is weakly tame at $p$ if $G$ has no non-trivial
normal $p$-subgroups. By convention we say that every finite group is weakly
tame at $0$. Now suppose that $G$ is a finite group which is weakly tame at the
residue characteristic of a discrete valuation ring $R$. Our main result shows
that the essential dimension of $G$ over the fraction field $K$ of $R$ is at
least as large as the essential dimension of $G$ over the residue field $k$. We
also prove a more general statement of this type for a class of \'etale gerbes
over $R$.
  As a corollary, we show that, if $G$ is weakly tame at $p$ and $k$ is any
field of characteristic $p >0$ containing the algebraic closure of
$\mathbb{F}_p$, then the essential dimension of $G$ over $k$ is less than or
equal to the essential dimension of $G$ over any characteristic $0$ field. A
conjecture of A. Ledet asserts that the essential dimension,
$\mathrm{ed}_k(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})$, of the cyclic group of order $p^n$
over a field $k$ is equal to $n$ whenever $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$.
We show that this conjecture implies that $\mathrm{ed}_{\mathbb{C}}(G) \geq n$
for any finite group $G$ which is weakly tame at $p$ and contains an element of
order $p^n$. To the best of our knowledge, an unconditional proof of the last
inequality is out of the reach of all presently known techniques.

subset of representative features from high dimensional data by eliminating
irrelevant and redundant features. Recently, feature selection combined with
sparse learning has attracted significant attention due to its outstanding
performance compared with traditional feature selection methods that ignores
correlation between features. These works first map data onto a low-dimensional
subspace and then select features by posing a sparsity constraint on the
transformation matrix. However, they are restricted by design to linear data
transformation, a potential drawback given that the underlying correlation
structures of data are often non-linear. To leverage a more sophisticated
embedding, we propose an autoencoder-based unsupervised feature selection
approach that leverages a single-layer autoencoder for a joint framework of
feature selection and manifold learning. More specifically, we enforce column
sparsity on the weight matrix connecting the input layer and the hidden layer,
as in previous work. Additionally, we include spectral graph analysis on the
projected data into the learning process to achieve local data geometry
preservation from the original data space to the low-dimensional feature space.
Extensive experiments are conducted on image, audio, text, and biological data.
The promising experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed

fluid compression and shear, and that the shear energization is proportional to
the pressure anisotropy of energetic particles. By analyzing results from fully

acceleration of high-energy particles in reconnection with a weak guide field,
and the compression and shear effects are comparable when the guide field is
50\% of the reconnecting component. Spatial distributions of those energization
effects reveal that reconnection exhausts, contracting islands, and island
merging regions are the three most important regions for compression and shear
acceleration. This study connects particle energization by particle
guiding-center drift motions with that due to background fluid motions, as in
the energetic particle transport theory. It provides foundations for building
particle transport models for large-scale reconnection acceleration such as
those in solar flares.

method of Barty, Carpentier, and Girardeau (RAIRO Operations Research,

fingerprinting attack against Tor that leverages a type of deep learning called
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a sophisticated architecture design,
and we evaluate this attack against WTF-PAD and Walkie-Talkie. The DF attack
attains over 98% accuracy on Tor traffic without defenses, better than all
prior attacks, and it is also the only attack that is effective against WTF-PAD
with over 90% accuracy. Walkie-Talkie remains effective, holding the attack to
just 49.7% accuracy. In the more realistic open-world setting, our attack
remains effective, with 0.99 precision and 0.94 recall on undefended traffic.
Against traffic defended with WTF-PAD in this setting, the attack still can get
0.96 precision and 0.68 recall. These findings highlight the need for effective
defenses that protect against this new attack and that could be deployed in
Tor.

of an accretion disc around a merging supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB).
The simulation is pseudo-Newtonian, with the BHs modeled as point masses with a
Paczynski-Wiita potential, and includes viscous heating, shock heating, and
radiative cooling. We follow the gravitational inspiral of an equal-mass binary
with a component mass M_bh=10^6 M_sun from an initial separation of 60r_g
(where r_g=GM_bh/c^2 is the gravitational radius) to the merger. We find that a
central, low-density cavity forms around the binary, as in previous work, but
that the BHs capture gas from the circumbinary disc and accrete efficiently via
their own minidiscs, well after their inspiral outpaces the viscous evolution
of the disc. The system remains luminous, displaying strong periodicity at
twice the binary orbital frequency throughout the entire inspiral process, all
the way to the merger. In the soft X-ray band, the thermal emission is
dominated by the inner edge of the circumbinary disc with especially clear
periodicity in the early inspiral. By comparison, harder X-ray emission is
dominated by the minidiscs, and the light curve is initially more noisy but
develops a clear periodicity in the late inspiral stage. This variability
pattern should help identify the EM counterparts of SMBHBs detected by the
space-based gravitational-wave detector LISA.

Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Portraits (IFRP) to recover latent
photorealistic faces from unaligned stylized portraits. Our IFRP method
consists of two components: Style Removal Network (SRN) and Discriminative

to the feature maps of the corresponding photorealistic faces. By embedding
spatial transformer networks into the SRN, our method can compensate for
misalignments of stylized faces automatically and output aligned realistic face
images. The role of the DN is to enforce recovered faces to be similar to
authentic faces. To ensure the identity preservation, we promote the recovered

which compares features of recovered and ground-truth faces extracted from a
pre-trained VGG network. We evaluate our method on a large-scale synthesized

distributed storage that reflects practical storage networks. To reflect the
clustered structure with limited cross-cluster communication bandwidths, nodes
in the same cluster are set to communicate $\beta_I$ symbols, while nodes in
other clusters can communicate $\beta_c \leq \beta_I$ symbols with one another.
We provide two types of exact regenerating codes which achieve the capacity of
clustered distributed storage: the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) codes
and the minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes. First, we construct MBR codes
for general parameter settings of clustered distributed storage. The suggested
MBR code is a generalization of an existing code proposed by Rashmi et al., for
scenarios where storage nodes are dispersed into L > 1 clusters. The proposed
MBR code for the $\beta_c = 0$ case requires a much smaller field size compared
to existing local MBR codes. Secondly, we devise MSR codes for clustered
distributed storage. Focus is given on two important cases:$\epsilon=0$ and
$\epsilon \in [1/(n-k), 1]$, where $\epsilon=\beta_c/\beta_I$ is the ratio of
the available cross- to intra-cluster repair bandwidths, n is the total number
of distributed nodes and k is the number of contact nodes in data retrieval.
The former represents the scenario where cross-cluster communication is not
allowed, while the latter corresponds to the case of minimum node storage
overhead. For $\epsilon=0$, two existing locally repairable codes are proven to
be MSR codes for the clustered model. For $\epsilon \in [1/(n-k), 1]$, existing
MSR codes for the non-clustered model are applicable to clustered scenarios
with a simple modification.

the influence of the kind of separation columns and the gradient of mobile
phase of ultra performance liquid chromatography. GABA was extracted with
distilled water from the germinated brown rice with the optimum extraction time
of 12 h. To validate this method the precision and the recovery were discussed.
In the concentration range from 5 to 50 microgram per mililiter, the
calibration curve for GABA was linear and the regression equation was obtained
with correlation coefficient of 0.999. GABA was analyzed by amino acid analyzer
in comparison with this method and the results of F-test and t-test indicated
that there were no significant differences in accuracy and precision between

opposite polarities started on September 5 and even lasted after the second
X-class flare on September 6. Moreover, the main sunspot with negative polarity
rotated around its umbral center and another main sunspot with positive
polarity also exhibited a slow rotation. The sunspot with negative polarity at
the northwest of active region also began to rotate counter-clockwise before
the onset of the first X-class flare. The successive formation and eruption of
two S-shaped structures were closely related to the counter-clockwise rotation
of three sunspots. It is also found that the rotation of sunspots is faster
during four hours prior to the onset of the flares than the period before. The
existence of a flux rope is found prior to the onset of two flares by using
non-linear force free field extrapolation based on the vector magnetograms
observed by SDO/HMI. These results suggest that shearing motion and sunspot
rotation play an important role in the buildup of the free energy and the
formation of flux ropes in the corona which produces solar flares and CMEs.

recent years. In systems with large corpus, however, the calculation cost for
the learnt model to predict all user-item preferences is tremendous, which
makes full corpus retrieval extremely difficult. To overcome the calculation
barriers, models such as matrix factorization resort to inner product form
(i.e., model user-item preference as the inner product of user, item latent
factors) and indexes to facilitate efficient approximate k-nearest neighbor
searches. However, it still remains challenging to incorporate more expressive
interaction forms between user and item features, e.g., interactions through
deep neural networks, because of the calculation cost.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of introducing arbitrary advanced
models to recommender systems with large corpus. We propose a novel tree-based
method which can provide logarithmic complexity w.r.t. corpus size even with
more expressive models such as deep neural networks. Our main idea is to
predict user interests from coarse to fine by traversing tree nodes in a
top-down fashion and making decisions for each user-node pair. We also show
that the tree structure can be jointly learnt towards better compatibility with
users' interest distribution and hence facilitate both training and prediction.
Experimental evaluations with two large-scale real-world datasets show that the
proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods. Online A/B test
results in Taobao display advertising platform also demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in production environments.

infrastructures. One of these examples is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
intrusion which is of course one of the most complex and the most dangerous
types of attacks. The impact of this type of attack, due to its powerful
nature, is much higher on cloud systems since in case of occurrence, the
service providers lose their services completely as well as their reputationand
loyal customers. This, apparently,can even lead to the collapse of the stock

multiple access (PDMA) is proposed. At the transmitter, pattern mapping
utilizes power allocation to improve the overall sum rate, and beam allocation
to enhance the access connectivity. At the receiver, hybrid detection utilizes
a spatial filter to suppress the inter-beam interference caused by beam domain
multiplexing, and successive interference cancellation to remove the intra-beam
interference caused by power domain multiplexing. Furthermore, we propose a
PDMA joint design approach to optimize pattern mapping based on both the power
domain and beam domain. The optimization of power allocation is achieved by
maximizing the overall sum rate, and the corresponding optimization problem is
shown to be convex theoretically. The optimization of beam allocation is
achieved by minimizing the maximum of the inner product of any two beam
allocation vectors, and an effective dimension reduction method is proposed
through the analysis of pattern structure and proper mathematical
manipulations. Simulation results show that the proposed PDMA approach
outperforms the orthogonal multiple access and power-domain non-orthogonal
multiple access approaches even without any optimization of pattern mapping,
and that the optimization of beam allocation yields a significant performance
improvement than the optimization of power allocation.

successful attacks against API call based malware classifiers. We investigate
control flow based characterization of a program execution to build robust deep

a top-level ensemble model. The low-level model is a per-application behavior
model, trained via transfer learning on a time-series of images generated from
control flow trace of an execution. We use Intel$^\circledR$ Processor Trace
enabled processor for low overhead execution tracing and design a lightweight
image conversion and segmentation of the control flow trace. The top-level
ensemble model aggregates the behavior classification of all the trace segments
and detects an attack. The use of hardware trace adds portability to our system
and the use of deep learning eliminates the manual effort of feature
engineering. We evaluate HeNet against real-world exploitations of PDF readers.
HeNet achieves 100\% accuracy and 0\% false positive on test set, and higher

tool to explore this new territory of possibility. Despite their successes to
reveal several key features of $\psi$DM, further progress in simulations is
limited, in that cosmological simulations so far can only address formation of
halos below $\sim 2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ and substantially more massive halos
have become computationally very challenging to obtain. For this reason, the
present work adopts a different approach in assessing massive halos by
constructing wave-halo solutions directly from the wave distribution function.
This approach bears certain similarity with the analytical construction of
particle-halo (cold dark matter model). Instead of many collisionless
particles, one deals with one single wave that has many non-interacting
eigenstates. The key ingredient in the wave-halo construction is the
distribution function of the wave power, and we use several halos produced by
structure formation simulations as templates to determine the wave distribution
function. Among different models, we find the fermionic King model presents the
best fits and we use it for our wave-halo construction. We have devised an
iteration method for constructing the nonlinear halo, and demonstrate its
stability by three-dimensional simulations. A Milky-Way-sized halo has also
been constructed, and the inner halo is found flatter than the NFW profile.
These wave-halos have small-scale interferences both in space and time
producing time-dependent granules. While the spatial scale of granules varies
little, the correlation time is found to increase with radius by one order of

estimation. We propose the use of log-scale distributions as a novel basis for
generating familes of prior distributions for local shrinkage hyperparameters.
By varying the scale parameter one may vary the degree to which the prior
distribution promotes sparsity in the coefficient estimates. By examining the
class of distributions over the logarithm of the local shrinkage parameter that
have log-linear, or sub-log-linear tails, we show that many standard prior
distributions for local shrinkage parameters can be unified in terms of the
tail behaviour and concentration properties of their corresponding marginal
distributions over the coefficients $\beta_j$. We derive upper bounds on the
rate of concentration around $|\beta_j|=0$, and the tail decay as $|\beta_j|
\to \infty$, achievable by this wide class of prior distributions.
  We then propose a new type of ultra-heavy tailed prior, called the log-$t$
prior with the property that, irrespective of the choice of associated scale
parameter, the marginal distribution always diverges at $\beta_j = 0$, and
always possesses super-Cauchy tails. We develop results demonstrating when
prior distributions with (sub)-log-linear tails attain Kullback--Leibler
super-efficiency and prove that the log-$t$ prior distribution is always
super-efficient. We show that the log-$t$ prior is less sensitive to
misspecification of the global shrinkage parameter than the horseshoe or lasso
priors. By incorporating the scale parameter of the log-scale prior
distributions into the Bayesian hierarchy we derive novel adaptive shrinkage
procedures. Simulations show that the adaptive log-$t$ procedure appears to
always perform well, irrespective of the level of sparsity or signal-to-noise

outperform scalar linear network codes, on multicast networks, with respect to
the alphabet size. The multicast networks which were used for this purpose are
generalized combination networks. In both the scalar and the vector network
coding solutions, the subspace distance is used as the distance measure for the
codes which solve the network coding problem in the generalized combination
networks. In this work we show that the subspace distance can be replaced with
two other possible distance measures which generalize the subspace distance.
These two distance measures are shown to be equivalent under an orthogonal
transformation. It is proved that the Grassmannian codes with the new distance
measures generalize the Grassmannian codes with the subspace distance and the
subspace designs with the strength of the design. Furthermore, optimal
Grassmannian codes with the new distance measureshave minimal requirements for
network coding solutions of some generalized combination networks. The coding

proved that codes in the Hamming scheme form a subfamily of the Grassmannian

collective stability method to incorporate adaptive controllers, and shows that
this method is insufficient for systems with large-gain interconnections.
Subsequently, we show that global asymptotic stability can be systematically
ensured by exploiting vector Lyapunov functions and algebraic Riccati
equations. This leads to a scalable distributed architecture where local
controllers require information from corresponding subsystems and neighbouring
controllers. Conveniently, the communication flow has the same topology as the

automorphisms of a finite graph via regular covering projections. Here we
describe with an example the problems we address and refer to the introductory
section for the correct statements of our results.
  Let $P$ be the Petersen graph, say, and let $\wp:\tilde{P}\to P$ be a regular
covering projection. With the current covering machinery, it is straightforward
to find $\wp$ with the property that every subgroup of $\Aut(P)$ lifts via
$\wp$. However, for constructing peculiar examples and in applications, this is
usually not enough. Sometimes it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of
$\Aut(P)$, to find $\wp$ along which $G$ lifts but no further automorphism of
$P$ does. For instance, in this concrete example, it is interesting to find a
covering of the Petersen graph lifting the alternating group $A_5$ but not the
whole symmetric group $S_5$. (Recall that $\Aut(P)\cong S_5$.) Some other time
it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of $\Aut(P)$, to find $\wp$ with the
property that $\Aut(\tilde{P})$ is the lift of $G$. Typically, it is desirable
to find $\wp$ satisfying both conditions. In a very broad sense, this might
remind wallpaper patterns on surfaces: the group of symmetries of the
dodecahedron is $S_5$, and there is a nice colouring of the dodecahedron (found
also by Escher) whose group of symmetries is just $A_5$.
  In this paper, we address this problem in full generality.

pebble isolation mass, when the core generates a pressure bump that traps
drifting pebbles outside its orbit. If the isolation mass is very small, then
gas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a
mainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the
planet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into
a gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation
mass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous
measurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all
relevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical
simulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling
law that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent
viscosity parameter $\alpha$. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas,
with Stokes number $\tau_{\rm f}<0.005$ can drift through the partial gap at
pebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must
be decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump. Turbulent
diffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble
isolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background
viscosity and on the pebble size. We finally explore the implications of the
new scaling law of the pebble isolation mass on the formation of planetary
systems by numerically integrating the growth and migration pathways of planets
in evolving protoplanetary discs. Compared to models neglecting the dependence
of the pebble isolation mass on the $\alpha$-viscosity, our models including
this effect result in larger core masses for giant planets. These larger core
masses are more akin to the core masses of the giant planets in the Solar
System.

region. The vortex bound state is also observed in the vortex center. The
tunneling spectra crossing a vortex show that the bound-state peak position

investigations provide experimental information to both the vortex lattice and
the vortex bound states in this iron-based superconductor.

applying a Liouville transformation and multiple Darboux transformations,
infinite sequences of solvable profiles of thermal effusivity can be
constructed together with the associated temperature (exact) solutions, all in
closed-form expressions (vs. the diffusion-time variable and with a growing
number of parameters). In addition, a particular class of profiles, so-called
sech(xi)-type profiles, exhibit high agility and in the same time parsimony. In
this paper we go further into the description of these solvable profiles and
their properties. Most importantly, their quadrupole formulation is provided
which allows building smooth synthetic profiles of effusivity of arbitrary
complexity and thereafter getting very easily the corresponding temperature
dynamic response. Examples are given with increasing variability of effusivity
and increasing number of elementary profiles. These highly flexible profiles
are equally relevant for providing an exact analytical solution to wave
propagation problems in 1D graded media (i.e. Maxwell's equations, acoustic
equation, telegraph equation...). From now on, let it be for diffusion-like or
wave-like problems, when the leading properties present (possibly piecewise-)

advantageously replaced by a ""high-level"" quadrupole model consisting of one or

effective-one-body, circularized, gravitational waveform for spinning
coalescing binaries, is here improved and generalized to all multipoles up to
$\ell=6$. For a test-particle orbiting a Kerr black hole, each multipolar
amplitude is truncated at relative 6~post Newtonian (PN) order, both for the
orbital (nonspinning) and spin factors. By taking a certain Pad\'e approximant
(typically the $P^4_2$ one) of the orbital factor in conjuction with the
inverse Taylor (iResum) representation of the spin factor, it is possible to
push the analytical/numerical agreement of the energy fluxe at the level of
$5\%$ at the last-stable-orbit for a quasi-maximally spinning black hole with
dimensionless spin parameter $+0.99$. When the procedure is generalized to
comparable-mass binaries, each orbital factor is kept at relative $3^{+3}$PN
order, i.e. the 3PN comparable-mass terms are hybridized with higher PN
test-particle terms up to 6PN relative order. The same Pad\'e resummation is
used for continuity. By contrast, the spin factor is only kept at the highest
comparable-mass PN-order currently available. We illustrate that the
consistency between different truncations in the spin content of the waveform
amplitudes is stronger in the resummed case than when using the standard
Taylor-expanded form of Pan et al.~[Phys.~Rev.~D~83 (2011) 064003]. We finally

networked system via its interacting components. Evidence of its ubiquity and
severity can be seen in a range of phenomena, from disease epidemics to
financial systemic risk. In order to understand the dynamics of these critical
phenomena, computational models map the probability of propagation as a
function of direct exposure, typically in the form of pairwise interactions
between components. By doing so, the important role of indirect interactions
remains unexplored. In response, we develop a simple model that accounts for
the effect of both direct and subsequent exposure, which we deploy in the novel
context of failure propagation within a real-world engineering project. We show
that subsequent exposure has a significant effect in key aspects, including
the: (a) final spreading event size, (b) propagation rate, and (c) spreading
event structure. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of hidden
influentials in large-scale spreading events, and evaluate the role of direct
and subsequent exposure in their emergence. Given the evidence of the
importance of subsequent exposure, our findings offer new insight on particular
aspects that need to be included when modelling network dynamics in general,
and spreading processes specifically.

the independent sources, is optimal for symmetric multilevel diversity coding
(SMDC) (Yeung-Zhang 1999). However, the characterization of the coding rate
region therein involves uncountably many linear inequalities and the constant
term (i.e., the lower bound) in each inequality is given in terms of the
solution of a linear optimization problem. Thus this implicit characterization
of the coding rate region does not enable the determination of the
achievability of a given rate tuple. In this paper, we first obtain closed-form
expressions of these uncountably many inequalities. Then we identify a finite
subset of inequalities that is sufficient for characterizing the coding rate
region. This gives an explicit characterization of the coding rate region. We
further show by the symmetry of the problem that only a much smaller subset of
this finite set of inequalities needs to be verified in determining the
achievability of a given rate tuple. Yet, the cardinality of this smaller set
grows at least exponentially fast with $L$. We also present a subset entropy
inequality, which together with our explicit characterization of the coding
rate region, is sufficient for proving the optimality of superposition coding.

standard spacetimes (Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics) and non-standard
spacetimes (e.g. Schwarzschild metric plus non-classical perturbations or
multiple black hole metrics). The most commonly employed explicit numerical
schemes (e.g. Runge-Kutta) are incapable of producing highly accurate results
at critical points, e.g. in the regions close to the event horizon where
gravity causes extreme curvature of the spacetime, at an acceptable
computational cost. Here, we describe a generalized algorithm for the numerical
integration of time-like (massive particles) and null (photons) geodesics in
any given 3+1 split spacetime. We introduce a new, exactly energy-conserving
implicit integration scheme based on the preservation of the underlying

Runge-Kutta explicit scheme and an implicit midpoint scheme. We test the
numerical performance of the three schemes against analytic solutions of
particle and photon orbits in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. We also prove
the versatility of our framework in handling more exotic metrics such as
Morris-Thorne wormholes and quantum-perturbed Schwarzschild black holes. The

Unfortunately, even a seemingly innocuous benchmarking mistake can compromise
the guarantees provided by a given systems security defense and also put its
reproducibility and comparability at risk. This threat is particularly
insidious as it is generally not a result of malice and can easily go
undetected by both authors and reviewers. Moreover, as modern defenses often
trade off security for performance in an attempt to find an ideal design point
in the performance-security space, the damage caused by benchmarking mistakes
is increasingly worrisome.
  To analyze the magnitude of the phenomenon, we identify a set of 22
""benchmarking crimes"" that threaten the validity of systems security
evaluations and perform a survey of 50 defense papers published in top venues.
To ensure the validity of our results, we perform the complete survey twice,
with two independent readers. We find only a very small number of disagreements
between readers, showing that our assessment of benchmarking crimes is highly
reproducible.
  We show that benchmarking crimes are widespread even in papers published at
tier-1 venues. We find that tier-1 papers commit an average of five
benchmarking crimes and we find only a single paper in our sample that
committed no benchmarking crimes. Moreover, we find that the scale of the
problem is constant over time, suggesting that the community is not yet
addressing it despite the problem being now more relevant than ever. This
threatens the scientific process, which relies on reproducibility and
comparability to ensure that published research advances the state of the art.

geodetic VLBI data post processing, which fully utilizes the cross spectrum
fringe phase information and therefore maximizes the power of single pulse
signals. Working with cross spectrum greatly reduces the effect of radio
frequency interference (RFI) compared with using auto spectrum. Single pulse
detection confidence increases by cross identifying detections from multiple
baselines. By combining the power of multiple baselines, we may improve the
detection sensitivity. Our method is similar to that of coherent beam forming,
but without the computational expense to form a great number of beams to cover
the whole field of view of our telescopes. The data processing pipeline
designed for this method is easy to implement and parallelize, which can be
deployed in various kinds of VLBI observations. In particular, we point out
that VGOS observations are very suitable for FRB search.

measuring the signal on degree scales. The signal amplitude depends on the
properties of the structure determining the reionization morphology. We
describe bubbles having radii distributed log-normally. The expected S/N is
sensitive to the mean bubble radius: $\bar{R}=5$ Mpc implies $S/N \approx 4$,
$\bar{R}=10$ Mpc implies $S/N \approx 20$. The spread of the radii distribution

spin state switching characteristics of SCO complex molecules at nanostructured
environments especially on-surface. Except for a very few cases, the SCO of a
surface bound thin molecular film is either quenched or heavily altered due to
(i) strong molecule-surface interactions and (ii) differing intermolecular
interactions in films relative to the bulk. By fabricating SCO complexes on a
weakly interacting surface such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)
and copper nitride (CuN), the interfacial quenching problem has been tackled.
However, engineering intermolecular interactions in thin SCO active films is
rather difficult. This work proposes a molecular self-assembly strategy to
fabricate thin spin switchable surface bound films with programmable
intermolecular interactions. Molecular engineering of the parent complex system
[Fe(H$_{2}$B(pz)$_{2}$)$_{2}$(bpy)] (pz = pyrazole, bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) with
a dodecyl (C$_{12}$) alkyl chain yielded a classical amphiphile-like functional

[Fe(H$_{2}$B(pz)$_{2}$)$_{2}$(C$_{12}$-bpy)] (C$_{12}$-bpy =
dodecyl[2,2'-bipyridine]-5-carboxylate). The bulk powder and 10 nm thin film,
on quartz glass/SiO$_{\rm x}$ surface, of the complex showed comparable spin
state switching characteristics mediated by similar lamellar bilayer like
self-assembly/molecular interactions in both bulk and thin film states. This
unprecedented observation augurs well for the development of SCO based
applications, especially in molecular spintronics.

and that stars of all components can be trapped at the corotation of the bar.
At the exception of those stars trapped at the corotation, we find that stars
that are far from their initial guiding radius are more likely so due to
blurring rather than churning effects. We compare the simulation to orbits
integration with a fixed gravitational potential rotating at a constant speed.
In the latter case, stars trapped at corotation are churned periodically
outside and inside the corotation radius, with a zero net average. However, as
the bar speed of the simulated galaxy decreases and its corotation radius
increases, stars trapped at corotation for several Gyrs can be churned outwards
on average. We study the location of extreme migrators (stars experimenting the
largest churning) and find that extreme migrators come from regions on the

simulated for a wide range of parameters typical for Classical T Tauri Stars
(CTTS). Radiative cooling of the shocked gas was calculated, taking into
account the self-absorption and non-equilibrium (time-dependent) effects in the
level populations. These effects modify the standard cooling curve for an
optically thin plasma in coronal equilibrium, however the shape of
high-temperature ($T>3\times10^5$ K) part of the curve remains unchanged. The
applied methods allow us to smoothly describe the transition from the cooling
flow to the hydrostatic stellar atmosphere. Thanks to this approach, it has
been found that the narrow component of HeII lines is formed predominantly in
the irradiated stationary atmosphere (hotspot), i.e. at velocities of the
settling gas $<2$ km s$^{-1}$. The structure of the pre-shock region is
calculated simultaneously with the heated atmosphere. The simulation shows that
the pre-shock gas produces a noticeable emission component in HeII lines and
practically does not manifest itself in HeI lines ($\lambda\lambda$ 5876, 10830
{\AA}). The UV spectrum of the hotspot is distorted by the pre-shock gas,
namely numerous red-shifted emission and absorption lines overlap each other
forming a pseudo-continuum. The spectrum of the accretion region at high
pre-shock densities $\sim10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ is fully formed in the in-falling

networks by introducing a variant of the concept of multi-node basin stability,
which allows us to gauge the global stability of the dynamics of the network in
response to local perturbations affecting a certain class of nodes of a system.
We show that perturbing nodes with high closeness and betweeness-centrality
significantly reduces the capacity of the system to return to the desired
state. This effect is very pronounced for a star network which has one hub node
with significantly different closeness/betweeness-centrality than all the
peripheral nodes. In such a network, perturbation of the single hub node has
the capacity to destroy the collective state. On the other hand, even when a
majority of the peripheral nodes are strongly perturbed, the hub manages to
restore the system to its original state, demonstrating the drastic effect of
the centrality of the perturbed node on the dynamics of the network. Further,
we explore explore Random Scale-Free Networks of bi-stable dynamical elements.
We exploit the difference in the distribution of betweeness centralities,
closeness centralities and degrees of the nodes in Random Scale-Free Networks
with m=1 and m=2, to probe which centrality property most influences the
robustness of the collective dynamics in these heterogeneous networks.
Significantly, we find clear evidence that the betweeness centrality of the
perturbed node is more crucial for dynamical robustness, than closeness
centrality or degree of the node. This result is important in deciding which
nodes to safeguard in order to maintain the collective state of this network
against targeted localized attacks.

recommendation methods, which aims at predicting users' preferences (ratings)
based on their past behaviors. Recently, various types of side information
beyond the explicit ratings users give to items, such as social connections
among users and metadata of items, have been introduced into CF and shown to be
useful for improving recommendation performance. However, previous works
process different types of information separately, thus failing to capture the
correlations that might exist across them. To address this problem, in this
work, we study the application of heterogeneous information network (HIN) to
enhance CF-based recommendation methods. However, we face challenging issues in
HIN-based recommendation, i.e., how to capture similarities of complex
semantics between users and items in a HIN, and how to effectively fuse these
similarities to improve final recommendation performance. To address these
issues, we apply metagraph to similarity computation and solve the information
fusion problem with a ``matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine
(FM)'' framework. For the MF part, we obtain the user-item similarity matrix
from each metagraph and then apply low-rank matrix approximation to obtain
latent features for both users and items. For the FM part, we apply FM with
Group lasso (FMG) on the features obtained from the MF part to train the
recommending model and, at the same time, identify the useful metagraphs.
Besides FMG, a two-stage method, we further propose an end-to-end method,
hierarchical attention fusing (HAF), to fuse metagraph based similarities for
the final recommendation. Experimental results on four large real-world
datasets show that the two proposed frameworks significantly outperform
existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation performance.

such a flash, the He-rich intershell matter is dredged up and dominates the
surface chemistry. Hence, in contrast to the usual H-rich WDs, their spectra
allow direct access to s-process element abundances in the intershell that were
synthesized during the AGB stage. In order to look for trans-iron group
elements (atomic number Z>29), we performed a non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium model atmosphere analysis of new ultraviolet spectra taken with the
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. One of our
program stars is of PG1159 spectral type; this star, PG1707+427, has effective
temperature Teff=85,000 K, and surface gravity logg=7.5. The two other stars
are DO white dwarfs: WD0111+002 has Teff=58,000 K and logg=7.7, and PG0109+111
has Teff=70,000 K and logg=8.0. These stars trace the onset of element
diffusion during early WD evolution. While zinc is the only trans-iron element
we could detect in the PG1159 star, both DOs exhibit lines from Zn, Ga, Ge, Se;
one additionally exhibits lines from Sr, Sn, Te, and I and the other from As.
Generally, the trans-iron elements are very abundant in the DOs, meaning that
radiative levitation must be acting. Most extreme is the almost six orders of
magnitude oversolar abundance of tellurium in PG0109+111. In terms of mass
fraction, it is the most abundant metal in the atmosphere. The two DOs join the
hitherto unique hot DO RE0503-289, in which 14 trans-iron elements had even

We find that the line-nodal state dominating at low doping levels is
topologically nontrivial and exhibits surface Majorana flat bands, which we
show perfectly match the bulk-boundary correspondence using Berry phase
approach. At higher doping levels we find a fully gapped state with trivial
topology. By analytically calculating the topological invariant of the line
nodes, we derive the critical point between the line-nodal and fully gapped
states as a function of both pairing parameters and doping. We find that the
line-nodal state is favored not only at lower doping levels but also if
symmetry-allowed deformations of the lattice is present. Adding simple energy
arguments we establish that a fully gapped state with broken time-reversal

time-reversal symmetry broken state to be topologically trivial, while we find
an additional point nodal state at very low doping levels to have nontrivial

density thresholding and we construct for each field a three-dimensional
radiative transfer (RT) model. These are used to estimate the relative
radiation field intensities, clump stability, and the uncertainty of column
density estimates. We examine the radial column density profiles of the clumps.
In the GCC fields, the structure noise follows the relations previously
established at larger scales. The fractal dimension has no significant
dependence on column density and the values D = 1.25 +- 0.07 are only slightly
lower than in typical molecular clouds. The column density PDFs exhibit large
variations, e.g. in the case of externally compressed clouds. At scales r>0.1
pc, the radial column density distributions of the clouds follow an average
relation of N~r^{-1}. In spite of a great variety of clump morphology, clumps
tend to follow a similar N~r^{-1} relation below r~0.1 pc. RT calculations
indicate only factor of 2.5 variation in the local radiation field intensity.
The fraction of gravitationally bound clumps increases significantly in regions
with A_V > 5 mag but most bound objects appear to be pressure-confined. The GCC
host clouds have statistical properties similar to general molecular clouds.
The gravitational stability, peak column density, and clump orientation are
connected to the cloud background while most other statistics (e.g. D and
radial profiles) are insensitive to the environment.

applications, many caching systems rely on consistent hashing to group a large
number of servers to form a cooperative cluster. These servers are organized
together according to a random hash function. They jointly provide a unified
but distributed hash table to serve swift and voluminous data item requests.
Different from the single least-recently-used (LRU) server that has already
been extensively studied, theoretically characterizing a cluster that consists
of multiple LRU servers remains yet to be explored. These servers are not
simply added together; the random hashing complicates the behavior. To this
end, we derive the asymptotic miss ratio of data item requests on a LRU cluster
with consistent hashing. We show that these individual cache spaces on
different servers can be effectively viewed as if they could be pooled together
to form a single virtual LRU cache space parametrized by an appropriate cache
size. This equivalence can be established rigorously under the condition that
the cache sizes of the individual servers are large. For typical data caching
systems this condition is common. Our theoretical framework provides a
convenient abstraction that can directly apply the results from the simpler
single LRU cache to the more complex LRU cluster with consistent hashing.

test all the dark carbonaceous asteroid families, which contain hydrated
members. We find that the major source of hydrated impactors is the family of
Themis, with a total implanted mass on Psyche to be of the order of 10^14 kg.
However, the hydrated fraction could be only a few per cent of the implanted
mass, as the water content in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, the best
analogue for the Themis asteroid family, is typically a few per cent of their
mass.

motion is present during the spatial scanning, whose instantaneous amplitude
could reach up to 1.3"" due to the earth's atmosphere and the precision of the
telescope guiding system, and seriously decreases the spatial resolution of 2D
spatial maps composed with the scanning spectra. We make the following effort
to resolve this problem: the imaging system (e.g., the TiO-band) is used to
record and detect the displacement vectors of solar image motion during the
raster scan, in both the slit and scanning directions. The spectral data (e.g.,
the Ha line) which are originally obtained in time sequence are corrected and
re-arranged in space according to those displacement vectors. Raster scans are
carried out in several active regions with different seeing conditions (two
rasters are illustrated in this paper). Given a certain spatial sample and
temporal resolution, the spatial resolution of the composed 2D map could be
close to that of the slit-jaw image. The resulting quality after correction is
quantitatively evaluated with two methods. Two-dimensional physical quantity,
such as the line-of-sight velocities in multi-layer of the solar atmosphere, is
also inferred demonstrating the effect of this technique.

strongly magnetized neutron star. It therefore bridges the gap between the
Galactic Be/X-ray binaries ($L_{\rm X}^{\rm peak} \leq 10^{38}$ erg/s) and the
ultraluminous X-ray pulsars ($L_{\rm X}^{\rm peak} \geq 10^{40}$ erg/s) found
in nearby galaxies. A number of observations were carried out to observe the
outburst. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive phase-resolved analysis on
the high quality data obtained with the Nustar and XMM-Newton, which were
observed at a high and intermediate luminosity levels. In order to get a better
understanding on the evolution of the whole extreme burst, we take the Swift
results at the low luminosity state into account as well. At the early stage of
outburst, the source shows a double-peak pulse profile, the second main peak
approaches the first one and merges into the single peak at the low luminosity.
The second main peak vanishes beyond 20 keV, and its radiation becomes much
softer than that of the first main peak. The line widths of fluorescent iron
line vary dramatically with phases, indicating a complicated geometry of
accretion flows. In contrast to the case at low luminosity, the pulse fraction
increases with the photon energy. The significant small pulse fraction detected
below 1 keV can be interpreted as the existence of an additional thermal
component located at far away from the central neutron star.

matched by a blackbody spectrum. We complement this data with previously
published Spitzer/IRAC observations of this target and interpret the combined
spectrum by computing a grid of self-consistent, 1D forward models, varying the
composition and energy budget. At these high temperatures, we find there are
important contributions to the overall opacity from H- ions, as well as the
removal of major molecules by thermal dissociation (including water), and
thermal ionization of metals. These effects were omitted in previous spectral
retrievals for very hot gas giants, and we argue that they must be included to
properly interpret the spectra of these objects. We infer a new metallicity and
C/O ratio for WASP-18 b, and find them well constrained to be solar
([M/H]=-0.01 (0.35), C/O<0.85 at 3 sigma confidence level), unlike previous
work but in line with expectations for giant planets. The best fitting
self-consistent temperature-pressure profiles are inverted, resulting in an
emission feature at 4.5 micron seen in the Spitzer photometry. These results
further strengthen the evidence that the family of very hot gas giant
exoplanets commonly exhibit thermal inversions.

burning on the WD to hide them. RT Cru is the prototype of such non-burning
symbiotics, with its hard ({\delta}-type) X-ray emission providing a view of
its innermost accretion structures. In the past 20 yr, RT Cru has experienced
two similar optical brightening events, separated by 4000 days and with
amplitudes of {\Delta}V 1.5 mag. After Swift became operative, the Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) detector revealed a hard X-ray brightening event almost in
coincidence with the second optical peak. Spectral and timing analyses of
multi-wavelength observations that we describe here, from NuSTAR, Suzaku,
Swift/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) + BAT + UltraViolet Optical Telescope (UVOT)
(photometry) and optical photometry and spectroscopy, indicate that accretion
proceeds through a disk that reaches down to the WD surface. The scenario in
which a massive, magnetic WD accretes from a magnetically truncated accretion
disk is not supported. For example, none of our data show the minute-time-scale
periodic modulations (with tight upper limits from X-ray data) expected from a
spinning, magnetic WD. Moreover, the similarity of the UV and X-ray fluxes, as
well as the approximate constancy of the hardness ratio within the BAT band,
indicate that the boundary layer of the accretion disk remained optically thin
to its own radiation throughout the brightening event, during which the rate of
accretion onto the WD increased to 6.7 $\times$ 10-9 Msun yr^{-1} (d/2 kpc)^2.

$m$ hypotheses are tested simultaneously. The FDR is the expectation of the
""false discovery proportion"" $\text{FDP}=V/R$ given by the ratio of the number
of false rejections $V$ and all rejections $R$. In this paper, we have a closer
look at the FDP for adaptive linear step-up multiple tests. These tests extend
the well known Benjamini and Hochberg test by estimating the unknown amount
$m_0$ of the true null hypotheses. We give exact finite sample formulas for
higher moments of the FDP and, in particular, for its variance. Using these
allows us a precise discussion about the consistency of adaptive step-up tests.
We present sufficient and necessary conditions for consistency on the
estimators $\widehat m_0$ and the underlying probability regime. We apply our
results to convex combinations of generalized Storey type estimators with
various tuning parameters and (possibly) data-driven weights. The corresponding
step-up tests allow a flexible adaptation. Moreover, these tests control the
FDR at finite sample size. We compare these tests to the classical Benjamini
and Hochberg test and discuss the advantages of it.

Poster presentation at a conference",,,,"cs.ET cs.AR cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Memristors are low-power memory-holding resistors thought to be useful for
neuromophic computing, which can compute via spike-interactions mediated
through the device's short-term memory. Using interacting spikes, it is
possible to build an AND gate that computes OR at the same time, similarly a
full adder can be built that computes the arithmetical sum of its inputs. Here
we show how these gates can be understood by modelling the memristors as a
novel type of perceptron: one which is sensitive to input order. The
memristor's memory can change the input weights for later inputs, and thus the
memristor gates cannot be accurately described by a single perceptron,
requiring either a network of time-invarient perceptrons or a complex
time-varying self-reprogrammable perceptron. This work demonstrates the high

induce on the correlation of the tangential shear with galaxy number counts,

lensing treats the number density of sources in a foreground bin as observable,

corrections. We find that already in the redshift range covered by the DES
first year data, these currently neglected relativistic terms lead to a
systematic correction of up to 50% in the density-shear correlation function
for the highest redshift bins. This correction is dominated by the the fact
that a redshift bin of number counts does not only lens sources in a background
bin, but is itself again lensed by all masses between the observer and the
counted source population. Relativistic corrections are currently ignored in
the standard galaxy-galaxy analyses, and the additional lensing of a counted
source populations is only included in the error budget (via the covariance
matrix). At increasingly higher redshifts and larger scales, these relativistic
and lensing corrections become however increasingly more important, and we here
argue that it is then more efficient, and also cleaner, to account for these
corrections in the density-shear correlations.

demonstration of a novel variable pitch quadrotor biplane Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle concept for payload delivery. The proposed design combines vertical
takeoff and landing (VTOL), precise hover capabilities of a quadrotor
helicopter and high range, endurance and high forward cruise speed
characteristics of a fixed wing aircraft. The proposed UAV is designed for a
mission requirement of carrying and delivering 6 kg payload to a destination at
16 km from the point of origin. First, the design of proprotors is carried out
using a physics based modified Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) analysis,
which is validated using experimental data generated for the purpose.
Proprotors have conflicting requirement for optimal hover and forward flight
performance. Next, the biplane wings are designed using simple lifting line

transmission design. Finally, weight estimation is carried out to complete the
design process. The proprotor design with 24 deg preset angle and -24 deg twist
is designed based on 70% weightage to forward flight and 30% weightage to
hovering flight conditions. The operating RPM of the proprotors is reduced from

during cruise flight. The estimated power consumption during forward flight
mode is 64% less than that required for hover, establishing the benefit of this
hybrid concept. A proof-of-concept scaled prototype is fabricated using
commercial-off-the-shelf parts. A PID controller is developed and implemented
on the PixHawk board to enable stable hovering flight and attitude tracking.

  V3 corrects a citation. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1708.08694",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) gives an optimal convergence rate when
minimizing convex stochastic objectives $f(x)$. However, in terms of making the
gradients small, the original SGD does not give an optimal rate, even when
$f(x)$ is convex.
  If $f(x)$ is convex, to find a point with gradient norm $\varepsilon$, we
design an algorithm SGD3 with a near-optimal rate
$\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$, improving the best known rate
$O(\varepsilon^{-8/3})$ of [18].
  If $f(x)$ is nonconvex, to find its $\varepsilon$-approximate local minimum,
we design an algorithm SGD5 with rate $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5})$, where
previously SGD variants only achieve $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ [6, 15, 33].
This is no slower than the best known stochastic version of Newton's method in
all parameter regimes [30].

is currently evolving from a pure research tool to aiding in clinical decision
making. Assessing the reliability of computational model predictions is a key
factor for clinical use, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity
analysis are important parts of such an assessment. In this study, we apply new
methods for UQ in computational heart mechanics to study uncertainty both in
material parameters characterizing global myocardial stiffness and in the local
muscle fiber orientation that governs tissue anisotropy. The uncertainty
analysis is performed using the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method, which
is a non-intrusive meta-modeling technique that surrogates the original
computational model with a series of orthonormal polynomials over the random
input parameter space. In addition, in order to study variability in the muscle
fiber architecture, we model the uncertainty in orientation of the fiber field
as an approximated random field using a truncated Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion.
The results from the UQ and sensitivity analysis identify clear differences in
the impact of various material parameters on global output quantities.
Furthermore, our analysis of random field variations in the fiber architecture
demonstrate a substantial impact of fiber angle variations on the selected
outputs, highlighting the need for accurate assignment of fiber orientation in
computational heart mechanics models.

dense optical spectroscopy for type II Plateau (IIP) supernova SN 2016X that
exploded in the nearby ($\sim$ 15 Mpc) spiral galaxy UGC 08041. The
observations span the period from 2 to 180 days after the explosion; in
particular, the Swift UV data probably captured the signature of shock breakout
associated with the explosion of SN 2016X. It shows very strong UV emission
during the first week after explosion, with contribution of $\sim$ 20 -- 30% to
the bolometric luminosity (versus $\lesssim$ 15% for normal SNe IIP). Moreover,
we found that this supernova has an unusually long rise time of about 12.6
$\pm$ 0.5 days in the $R$ band (versus $\sim$ 7.0 days for typical SNe IIP).
The optical light curves and spectral evolution are quite similar to the
fast-declining type IIP object SN 2013ej, except that SN 2016X has a relatively
brighter tail. Based on the evolution of photospheric temperature as inferred
from the $Swift$ data in the early phase, we derive that the progenitor of SN
2016X has a radius of about 930 $\pm$ 70 R$_{\odot}$. This large-size star is
expected to be a red supergiant star with an initial mass of $\gtrsim$ 19 -- 20
M$_{\odot}$ based on the mass $--$ radius relation of the Galactic red
supergiants, and it represents one of the most largest and massive progenitors
found for SNe IIP.

original frame can be recovered from the watermarked frame without any
distortion. Although reversible video watermarking has successfully been
applied in multimedia, its application has not been extensively explored in
medical videos. Reversible watermarking in medical videos is still a
challenging problem. The existing reversible video watermarking algorithms,
which are based on error prediction expansion, use motion vectors for
prediction. In this study, we propose an adaptive reversible watermarking
method for medical videos. We suggest using temporal correlations for improving
the prediction accuracy. Hence, two temporal neighbor pixels in upcoming frames
are used alongside the four spatial rhombus neighboring pixels to minimize the
prediction error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this
method is applied to medical videos. The method helps to protect patients'
personal and medical information by watermarking, i.e., increase the security
of Health Information Systems (HIS). Experimental results demonstrate the high
quality of the proposed watermarking method based on PSNR metric and a large
capacity for data hiding in medical videos.
