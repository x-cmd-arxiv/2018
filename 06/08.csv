galaxies (one not much smaller than the other) has produced fireworks
especially in the larger one, when hit roughly perpendicularly to the plane. We
analyze the point sources, produced by the starburst episode following the
impact, in the rings of seven galaxies and determine their X-ray luminosity
function (XLF). In total we detect 63 sources, of which 50 have luminosity L$_X
\geq 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, classifying them as ultra luminous X-ray sources
(ULXs). We find that the total XLF is not significantly different from XLFs
derived for other kinds of galaxies, with a tendency of having a larger
fraction of high X-ray luminosity objects. Both the total number of ULXs and
the number of ULXs per unit star formation rate are found in the upper envelope
of the more normal galaxies distribution. Further analysis would be needed to
address the issue of the nature of the compact component in the binary system.

system can be mapped onto a node-free quantum state whose coefficients are
given by thermal weights. This perspective permits the construction of a
dissipative -- yet quantum -- dynamics which encodes in its stationary state
the thermal state of the original problem. We show for the case of an
all-to-all connected Ising spin model that an appropriate transformation of
this dissipative dynamics allows to interpolate between a regime in which the
order parameter obeys the classical equations of motion under Glauber dynamics,
to a quantum regime with an accelerated approach to stationarity. We show that
this effect enables in principle a speedup of pattern retrieval in a Hopfield

photometric variability data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae

Subsequent radial velocity measurements reveal a system with an orbital period
of 83 days and near-zero eccentricity. The photometric variability period of
the giant is consistent with the orbital period, indicative of star spots and
tidal synchronization. Constraints on the giant's mass and radius from its
luminosity, surface gravity, and temperature imply an unseen companion with
mass of $3.3^{+2.8}_{-0.7}$ M$_\odot$, indicating a low-mass black hole or an
exceedingly massive neutron star. Measurement of the astrometric binary motion
by {\it Gaia} will further characterize the system. This discovery demonstrates
the potential of massive spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE and all-sky,

developing quantum computers. Simulating a quantum system classically is almost
impossible beyond a certain system size whereas a controllable quantum system
inherently has the resources and computing space to simulate another system.
Analog quantum simulation is one of the ways of quantum simulation through
which a known system mimics an unknown system. A key aspect of this is the
ability to generate the target Hamiltonian using control operations which is
referred to as Hamiltonian engineering. One way of doing this is to apply pulse
sequences over a length of time such that the average Hamiltonian over this
period is the desired one. In this thesis, we discuss the method of filtered
Hamiltonian engineering which works in a similar fashion. Using this technique,
we create a star topology from a general network of spins.
  Quantum communication between two parties is an important task for its
applications in information theory as well as for its use in a quantum
computer. A typical solution to this is using teleportation through the means
of shared entangled qubits. Teleportation is not ideal for short-range
communication such as between two units in a quantum computer. It has been
shown that information can be transported from one node of a quantum spin
network to another by natural evolution of the system over time. Such networks
are better suited for solid-state based computing architectures as well as for
short-range communication. The Hamiltonian that permits such transport however
places stringent requirements on the parameters of the network. While
individual control of spins cannot be avoided in most cases, excess control can
introduce noise. In this thesis, we work on a few models of spin networks that
permit information transport with minimal requirements on the parameters of the
network.

look at the user detection performance of such algorithms under noise and
relate its performance to the classical block correlation detector with
orthogonal signatures. More specifically, we derive a lower bound for the
diversity order which, under suitable choice of the signatures, equals that of
the block correlation detector. Surprisingly, in specific parameter settings
non-orthogonal pilots, i.e. pilots where (cyclically) shifted versions
interfere with each other, outperform the block correlation detector.
Altogether, we show that, in wide parameter regimes, the hierarchical
thresholding detectors behave like the classical correlator with improved
detection performance but operate with much less required pilot subcarriers. We
provide mathematically rigorous and easy to handle formulas for numerical
evaluations and system design. Finally, we evaluate our findings with numerical
examples and show that, in a practical parameter setting, a classical pilot
channel can accommodate up to three advanced pilot channels with the same

detected over the complete GEMINI-GMOS FOV, has three identifiable kinematic

which is consistent with rotation in the galaxy disk. A broad (\sigma > 115
km/s) redshifted component, detected near the NE and SW radio lobes; which we
interpret as a radio jet driven outflow. And a broad (\sigma > 115 km/s)
blueshifted component that shows high velocities in a region perpendicular to
the radio jet axis; we interpret this as an equatorial outflow. The CO J:2-1
emission is detected in spiral arms on 5\arcsec - 20\arcsec scales, and in two
disturbed circumnuclear regions. The molecular kinematics in the spiral arms

  Algorithmically Tractable Class","72 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a new framework for generalizing approximation algorithms from the
structural graph algorithm literature so that they apply to graphs somewhat
close to that class (a scenario we expect is common when working with
real-world networks) while still guaranteeing approximation ratios. The idea is
to $\textit{edit}$ a given graph via vertex- or edge-deletions to put the graph
into an algorithmically tractable class, apply known approximation algorithms
for that class, and then $\textit{lift}$ the solution to apply to the original
graph. We give a general characterization of when an optimization problem is
amenable to this approach, and show that it includes many well-studied graph
problems, such as Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Minimum
Maximal Matching, Chromatic Number, ($\ell$-)Dominating Set, Edge
($\ell$-)Dominating Set, and Connected Dominating Set.
  To enable this framework, we develop new editing algorithms that find the
approximately-fewest edits required to bring a given graph into one of several
important graph classes (in some cases, also approximating the target parameter
of the family). For bounded degeneracy, we obtain a bicriteria
$(4,4)$-approximation which also extends to a smoother bicriteria trade-off.
For bounded treewidth, we obtain a bicriteria $(O(\log^{1.5} n), O(\sqrt{\log
w}))$-approximation, and for bounded pathwidth, we obtain a bicriteria
$(O(\log^{1.5} n), O(\sqrt{\log w} \cdot \log n))$-approximation. For treedepth
$2$ (also related to bounded expansion), we obtain a $4$-approximation. We also
prove complementary hardness-of-approximation results assuming $\mathrm{P} \neq
\mathrm{NP}$: in particular, these problems are all log-factor inapproximable,
except the last which is not approximable below some constant factor ($2$
assuming UGC).

($0\nu\beta\beta$) rate induced by lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators up
to dimension nine in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. We provide an
end-to-end framework connecting the possibly very high LNV scale to the nuclear
scale, through a chain of effective field theories. Starting at the electroweak
scale, we integrate out the heavy Standard Model degrees of freedom and we
match to an $SU(3)_c\otimes U(1)_{\mathrm{em}}$ effective theory. After
evolving the resulting effective Lagrangian to the QCD scale, we use chiral
perturbation theory to derive the lepton-number-violating chiral Lagrangian.
The chiral Lagrangian is used to derive the two-nucleon $0\nu\beta\beta$
transition operators to leading order in the chiral power counting. Based on
renormalization arguments we show that in various cases short-range two-nucleon
operators need to be enhanced to leading order. We show that all required
nuclear matrix elements can be taken from existing calculations. Our final
result is a master formula that describes the $0\nu\beta\beta$ rate in terms of
phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements, hadronic low-energy constants,
QCD evolution factors, and high-energy LNV Wilson coefficients, including all
the interference terms. Our master formula can be easily matched to any model
where LNV originates at energy scales above the electroweak scale. As an
explicit example, we match our formula to the minimal left-right-symmetric
model in which contributions of operators of different dimension compete, and
we discuss the resulting phenomenology.

the phenomena of the spread of influence in social networks such as disease,
opinion, adaptation of new product and etc. The elements of the network which
have been influenced (e.g. infected or adapted an opinion) are called active
vertices. It is assumed in these models that when an element is activated, it
remains active until the end of the process. But in some phenomena of the
spread of influence this property does not hold. For example in some diseases
the infection lasts only a limited period of time or consider the spread of
disease or propagation of computer virus together with some quarantination or
decontamination methods. Dynamic monopolies are not useful for the study of
these latter phenomena. For this purpose, we introduce a new model for such
diffusions of influence and call it weak dynamic monopoly. A social network is
represented by a graph $G$. Assume that any vertex $v$ of $G$ has a threshold
$\tau(v)\in \Bbb{N}$. Then a subset $D\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a weak
dynamic monopoly if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $D_0=D, D_1, \ldots, D_k$
such that for any $i$, any vertex $v$ of $D_i$ has at least $\tau(v)$ neighbors
in $D_{i-1}$. In this definition, by the size and the processing time of $D$ we
mean $|D|$ and $k$, respectively. We first investigate the relationships
between weak dynamic monopolies and other related concepts and then obtain some
bounds for the smallest size of weak dynamic monopolies. Next we obtain some
results concerning the processing time of weak dynamic monopolies in terms of
some graph parameters. Finally, a hardness result concerning inapproximibility
of the determining the smallest size of weak dynamic monopolies in general
graphs is obtained.

spectrum that are associated with systematic errors. We apply this to the BOSS
CMASS sample, to see if it removes the excess power previously observed beyond
the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model on very large scales. We consider several
possible sources of data contamination, and check whether they affect the
number of targets that can be observed and the power spectrum measurements. We
describe a general framework for how such knowledge can be transformed into
template fields. Mode subtraction can then be used to remove these systematic
contaminants at least as well as applying corrective weighting to the observed
galaxies, but benefits from giving an unbiased power. Even after applying
templates for all known systematics, we find a large-scale power excess, but
this is reduced compared with that observed using the weights provided by the
BOSS team. This excess is at much larger scales than the BAO scale and does not
affect the main results of BOSS. However, it will be important for the
measurement of a scale-dependent bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. The
excess is beyond that allowed by any simple model of non-Gaussianity matching
Planck data, and is not matched in other surveys. We show that this power
excess can further be reduced but is still present using ""phenomenological""
templates, designed to consider further potentially unknown sources of
systematic contamination. As all discrepant angular modes can be removed using
""phenomenological"" templates, the potentially remaining contaminant acts
radially.

evolves in a distinctive way that can help in determining the average

<T_21> b_21(z) matches the true value to within 10% for <x_i> <~ 0.8. We
consider the 21 cm auto-bispectrum and show that this statistic may also be

application to the simulation in unconventional sintering techniques, e.g.
spark plasma sintering, field-assisted sintering, and selective laser
sintering, where non-equilibrium and high temperature gradient exist. In the
model, order parameters are adopted to represent the bulk and atmosphere/pore
region, as well as the crystallographic orientations. Based on the entropy
analysis, the temperature-dependent free energy density is developed, which
includes contributions from the internal energy (induced by the change of
temperature and order parameters) and the order parameter related
configurational entropy. The temperature-dependent model parameters are
determined by using the experimental data of surface and grain boundary
energies and interface width. From laws of thermodynamics, the kinetics for the
order parameters and the order-parameter-coupled heat transfer are derived. The
model is numerically implemented by the finite element method. Grain
coalescence from two identical particles shows that non-isothermal condition
leads to the unsymmetric morphology and curved grain boundary due to the
gradients of on-site surface and grain-boundary energies induced by the local
temperature inhomogeneity. More simulations on the non-isothermal grain
coalescence from two non-identical and multiple particles present the temporal
evolution of grain shrinkage/growth, neck growth, and porosity, demonstrating
the capability and versatility of the model. It is anticipated that the work
could provide a contribution to the research community of unconventional

conductance features in a topologically trivial phase, mimicking spatially
separated topological Majorana states. We show that in addition to the
suppressed coupling between the quasi-Majorana states, also the coupling of
these states across a tunnel barrier to the outside is exponentially different

most of the proposed Majorana signatures: quantized zero-bias peaks, the $4\pi$
Josephson effect, and the tunneling spectrum in presence of a normal quantum

having a bulk topological transition. Because braiding schemes rely only on the
ability to couple to individual Majorana states, the exponential control over
coupling strengths allows to also use quasi-Majorana states for braiding.
Therefore, while the appearance of quasi-Majorana states complicates the
observation of topological Majorana states, it opens an alternative route
towards braiding of non-Abelian anyons and protected quantum computation.

provides a viable diagnostic of the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF). A
survey is underway to map the local ISMF using data collected at eight
observatories in both hemispheres. Two approaches are used to obtain the
magnetic structure: statistically evaluating magnetic field directions traced
by multiple polarization position angles, and least-squares fits that provide
the dipole component of the magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field in
the circumheliospheric interstellar medium (CHM), which drives winds of
interstellar gas and dust through the heliosphere, drapes over the heliopause
and influences polarization measurements. We discover a polarization band that
can be described with a great circle that traverses the heliosphere nose and
ecliptic poles. A gap in the band appears in a region coinciding both with the
highest heliosheath pressure, found by IBEX, and the center of the Loop I
superbubble. The least-squares analysis finds a magnetic dipole component of
the polarization band with the axis oriented toward the ecliptic poles. The
filament of dust around the heliosphere and the warm helium breeze flowing
through the heliosphere trace the same magnetic field directions. Regions along
the polarization band near the heliosphere nose have magnetic field
orientations within 15 degrees of sightlines. Regions in the IBEX ribbon have
field directions within 40 degrees of the plane of the sky. Several spatially
coherent magnetic filaments are within 15 pc. Most of the low frequency radio
emissions detected by the two Voyager spacecraft follow the polarization band.
The geometry of the polarization band is compared to the Local Interstellar
Cloud, the Cetus Ripple, the BICEP2 low opacity region, Ice Cube IC59 galactic

quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout the entire
system. This concept underlies the dynamics of thermalization in closed quantum
systems, and more recently has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing
chaos in black holes. However, the direct experimental measurement of quantum
scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential complexity of ergodic
many-body entangled states. One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to
measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, since
scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between
quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence. Here, we implement a quantum
circuit that provides a positive test for the scrambling features of a given
unitary process. This approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through
the circuit, providing an unambiguous litmus test for scrambling while
projecting potential circuit errors into an ancillary observable. We engineer
quantum scrambling processes through a tunable 3-qubit unitary operation as
part of a 7-qubit circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured
teleportation fidelities are typically $\sim80\%$, and enable us to
experimentally bound the scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC
measurement.

predicting the outcome of closed loop policy behavior. We propose a novel

topologically ordered phase of matter and also among the most promising
candidate models to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation with minimal
resource overhead. The contributions of this work are threefold. First of all,
we build upon the abstract theory of boundaries and domain walls of topological
phases of matter to comprehensively catalog the objects realizable in color
codes. Together with our classification we also provide lattice representations
of these objects which include three new types of boundaries as well as a
generating set for all 72 color code twist defects. Our work thus provides an
explicit toy model that will help to better understand the abstract theory of
domain walls. Secondly, we discover a number of interesting new applications of
the cataloged objects for quantum information protocols. These include improved
methods for performing quantum computations by code deformation, a new
four-qubit error-detecting code, as well as families of new quantum
error-correcting codes we call stellated color codes, which encode logical
qubits at the same distance as the next best color code, but using
approximately half the number of physical qubits. To the best of our knowledge,
our new topological codes have the highest encoding rate of local stabilizer
codes with bounded-weight stabilizers in two dimensions. Finally, we show how
the boundaries and twist defects of the color code are represented by multiple
copies of other phases. Indeed, in addition to the well studied comparison
between the color code and two copies of the surface code, we also compare the
color code to two copies of the three-fermion model. In particular, we find
that this analogy offers a very clear lens through which we can view the
symmetries of the color code which gives rise to its multitude of domain walls.

a dozen distinct representations that are sent on to central brain areas, such
as the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus. The retina can
be viewed as a parallel image processor made of a multitude of small
computational devices. Neural circuits of the retina are constituted by various
cell types that separate the incoming visual information in different channels.
Visual information is processed by retinal neural circuits and several
computations are performed extracting distinct features from the visual scene.
The aim of this article is to understand the computational basis involved in
processing visual information which finally leads to several feature detectors.
Therefore, the elements that form the basis of retinal computations will be
explored by explaining how oscillators can lead to a final output with
computational meaning. Linear versus nonlinear systems will be presented and
the retina will be placed in the context of a nonlinear system. Finally,
simulations will be presented exploring the concept of the retina as a
nonlinear system which can perform understandable computations converting a
known input into a predictable output.

mechanism of coronal mass ejection (CME) suppression in active stars by an
overlying large-scale magnetic field. We use a state-of-the-art 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code which considers a self-consistent coupling
between an Alfv\'en wave-driven stellar wind solution, and a first-principles
CME model based on the eruption of a flux-rope anchored to a mixed polarity
region. By replicating the driving conditions used in simulations of strong
solar CMEs, we show that a large-scale dipolar magnetic field of $75$ G is able
to fully confine eruptions within the stellar corona. Our simulations also
consider CMEs exceeding the magnetic energy used in solar studies, which are
able to escape the large-scale magnetic field confinement. The analysis
includes a qualitative and quantitative description of the simulated CMEs and
their dynamics, which reveals a drastic reduction of the radial speed caused by
the overlying magnetic field. With the aid of recent observational studies, we
place our numerical results in the context of solar and stellar flaring events.
In this way, we find that this particular large-scale magnetic field
configuration establishes a suppression threshold around $\sim$$3 \times
10^{32}$~erg in the CME kinetic energy. Extending the solar flare-CME relations
to other stars, such CME kinetic energies could be typically achieved during
erupting flaring events with total energies larger than $6 \times 10^{32}$ erg
(GOES class $\sim$X70).

The abundant obsidian, lithics, and ostracods within many sub-units suggest
that the associated eruption pulses involved water-magma interaction.
  Eruptions from the Mono Craters during the late Pleistocene were consistent
neither in frequency nor volume. The Mono Craters were most active during the
eruption of tephras in Sequences C ($\sim$42.5-39.4 ka) and A ($\sim$14.1-12.9

forefront of extra-galactic astronomy in recent years, estimating the energy

the energy associated with an outflow often involves an assumption of uniform
density in the NLR, which span a wide range in literature leading to large
systematic uncertainties in energy estimation. In this paper, we present
electron density maps for a sample of outflowing and non-outflowing Seyfert
galaxies at z<0.02 drawn from the S7 survey and understand the origin and
values of the observed density structures to reduce the systematic
uncertainties in outflow energy estimation. We use the ratio of the
[SII]6716,6731 emission lines to derive spatially resolved electron densities
(<50-2000 cm$^{-3}$). Using optical IFU observations, we are able to measure
densities across the central 2-5 kpc of the selected AGN host galaxies. We
compare the density maps with the positions of the HII regions derived from the
narrow H$\alpha$ component, ionization maps from [OIII], and spatially resolved
BPT diagrams, to infer the origin of the observed density structures. We also
use the electron density maps to construct density profiles as a function of
distance from the central AGN. We find a spatial correlation between the sites
of high star formation and high electron density for targets without an active
ionized outflow. The non-outflowing targets also show an exponential drop in
the electron density as a function of distance from the center, with a mean
exponential index of ~0.15. The correlation between the star forming sites and
electron density ceases for targets with an outflow. The density within the
outflowing medium is not uniform and shows both low and high density sites,
most likely due to the presence of shocks and highly turbulent medium.

  Here, we consider the geometrically dual objects of noncommutative algebras

objects of study of noncommutative operator geometry. By adapting the spectral
presheaf of Hamilton-Isham-Butterfield, a formulation of quantum state space

Hausdorff spaces to a suitable target category can be applied directly to these
geometric objects to automatically yield an extension $\tilde{F}$ acting on all
unital $C^*$-algebras.
  This procedure is used to give a novel formulation of the operator

$C^*$-algebraic conjecture that the extension of the functor that assigns to a

We apply machine learning to derive a mapping between lightcurve features of
these variable stars and their magnitude to extend the traditional
period-luminosity (PL) relation commonly used for Cepheid samples. Using
photometric data for long period variable stars in the Large Magellanic cloud
(LMC), we demonstrate that our predictions produce residual errors comparable
to those obtained on the corresponding Cepheid population. We show that our
model generalizes well to other samples by performing a blind test on
photometric data from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our predictions on the
SMC again show small residual errors and biases, comparable to results that
employ PL relations fitted on Cepheid samples. The residual biases are
complementary between the long period variable and Cepheid fits, which provides
exciting prospects to better control sources of systematic error in
cosmological distance measurements. We finally show that the proposed
methodology can be used to optimize samples of variable stars as standard
candles independent of any prior variable star classification.

ground states with multiple broken symmetries. Upon heating, such states may
undergo two-step thermal transitions into the symmetric paramagnetic phase,
with partial restoration of broken symmetries in the intervening phase. For
nonzero magnetic field, we show the evolution of these thermal phase
transitions strongly depends on the field direction, due to clock anisotropy

factor, accelerating gradient and operating temperature (4.2 K vs 2 K)
resulting in significant reduction in both capital and operating costs compared
to traditional niobium SRF accelerator cavities. Tin vapor diffusion coating of
Nb3Sn on niobium appears to be a simple, yet most efficient technique so far to
fabricate such cavities. Here, cavity interior surface coatings are obtained by
a two step process: nucleation followed by deposition. The first step is
normally accomplished with Sn/SnCl2 at a constant low temperature (500 {\deg}C)
for several hours. To elucidate the role of this step, we systematically
studied the niobium surface nucleated under varying process conditions. The
surfaces obtained in typical tin/tin chloride processes were characterized
using SEM/EDS, AFM, XPS, SAM and TEM. Examination of the surfaces nucleated
under the standard conditions revealed not only tin particles, but also tin
film on the surfaces resembling the surface obtained by Stranski-Krastanov
growth mode. All the nucleation attempted with SnCl2 yielded better uniformity
of Nb3Sn coating compared to coating obtained without nucleation, which often
included random patchy regions with irregular grain structure. Even though the
variation of nucleation parameters was able to produce different surfaces
following nucleation, no evidence was found for any significant impact on the
final coating.

problem. The input is a set of axis-aligned rectangles in the plane. The
objective is to find a set of horizontal line segments of minimum total length
so that every rectangle is stabbed by some line segment. A line segment stabs a
rectangle if it intersects its left and its right boundary. The problem, which
we call Stabbing, can be motivated by a resource allocation problem and has
applications in geometric network design. To the best of our knowledge, only
special cases of this problem have been considered so far.
  Stabbing is a weighted geometric set cover problem, which we show to be
NP-hard. A constrained variant of Stabbing turns out to be even APX-hard. While
for general set cover the best possible approximation ratio is $\Theta(\log
n)$, it is an important field in geometric approximation algorithms to obtain
better ratios for geometric set cover problems. Chan et al. [SODA'12]
generalize earlier results by Varadarajan [STOC'10] to obtain sub-logarithmic
performances for a broad class of weighted geometric set cover instances that
are characterized by having low shallow-cell complexity. The shallow-cell
complexity of Stabbing instances, however, can be high so that a direct
application of the framework of Chan et al. gives only logarithmic bounds. We
still achieve a constant-factor approximation by decomposing general instances
into what we call laminar instances that have low enough complexity.
  Our decomposition technique yields constant-factor approximations also for

the number of cosmological parameters considered, using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve
algorithm with an analytic covariance model. In the first case, we infer the
posterior through MCMC sampling from the likelihood of the compressed
data-vector (MC-KL). The second, faster option, works by first Gaussianising
and then orthogonalising the parameter space before the compression; in this
option (G-PCA) we only need to run a low-resolution preliminary MCMC sample for
the Gaussianization to compute our posterior. Both compression methods
accurately reproduce the posterior distributions obtained by standard MCMC
sampling on the CMASS dataset for a $k$-space range of
$0.03-0.12\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. The compression enables us to increase the number
of bispectrum measurements by a factor of $\sim 23$ over the standard binning
(from 116 to 2734 triangles used), which is otherwise limited by the number of
mock catalogues available. This reduces the $68\%$ credible intervals for the

demonstrate that CDI can be modeled as a linear time invariant system. We
validate this model with experiments, and show that a sinusoid voltage
operation can simultaneously achieve high salt removal and strong energy
performance, thus very likely making it superior to other conventional
operating methods. Based on the underlying coupled phenomena of electrical
charge (and ionic) transfer with bulk advection in CDI, we derive and validate
experimentally the concept of using sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to
achieve resonance-type operation for CDI. Despite the complexities of the
system, we find a simple relation for the resonant time scale: the resonant
time period is proportional to the geometric mean of the flow residence time
and the electrical (RC) charging time. Operation at resonance implies the
optimal balance between absolute amount of salt removed (in moles) and dilution
(depending on the feed volume processed), thus resulting in the maximum average
concentration reduction for the desalinated water. Using a generalized tool
based on Fourier analysis, we show that most of the salt removal (~95%) for
square and triangular voltage forcing waveforms is achieved by the fundamental
Fourier (sinusoidal) mode. The frequency of higher Fourier modes precludes high
flow efficiency for these modes, so these modes consume additional energy for
minimal additional salt removed. This deficiency of higher frequency modes
further highlights the advantage of DC-offset sinusoidal forcing for CDI
operation.

performed with synthetic streaks, in both turbulent channel and Couette flows,
show clearly that particles trigger the instability in channel flow whereas the
plane Couette flow becomes laminar. Moreover, we have shown that particles have
a pronounced impact on pressure-driven flow through a detailed temporal and
spatial analysis whereas they have no significant impact on plane Couette flow
configuration. The substantial difference between both flows is related to the
spatial preferential distribution of particles in the large-scale rolls
(inactive motion) in Couette flow, whereas they are accumulated in the ejection
(active motion) regions in the pressure-driven flow. Through investigation of
particle modification on two distinct flow configurations, we were able to show
the specific response of turbulent structures and the modulation of the
fundamental mechanisms composing the regeneration cycle in the buffer layer of
near-wall turbulence. Especially for pressure-driven flow, the particles
enhance the lift- up and let it act continuously whereas the particles do not
significantly alter the streak breakdown process. The reinforcement of the
streamwise vortices is attributed to the vorticity stretching term by the wavy

stretching and consequently strengthen the circulation of the large-scale

investigated several methods to reliably infer sentiment from lexical, speech

is still a challenge. For instance, in expanding sentiment analysis to new
languages and cultures, it may not always be possible to obtain comprehensive
labeled datasets. In this paper, we investigate the application of
semi-supervised and transfer learning methods to improve performances on low
resource sentiment classification tasks. We experiment with extracting dense
feature representations, pre-training and manifold regularization in enhancing
the performance of sentiment classification systems. Our goal is a coherent
implementation of these methods and we evaluate the gains achieved by these
methods in matched setting involving training and testing on a single corpus
setting as well as two cross corpora settings. In both the cases, our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly enhance the
model performance against a purely supervised approach, particularly in cases
involving a handful of training data.

interacting fermionic ladders with spin-orbit coupling. Within a
microscopically motivated bosonization approach, we investigate different
competing phases depending on same-spin and interspin interactions at
fractional effective filling $\nu=1/3$ per spin. In the spin-decoupled limit,
we find that strong repulsive interactions of already moderate range may lead
to a partially gapped state with two time-reversed copies of a quasi-one
dimensional Laughlin phase. This FTI precursor competes with an interleg
partially gapped phase displaying quasi long-range density wave order, however
it may be stabilized if interactions have suitable anisotropy, or are
sufficiently near SU($2$) symmetry, in leg space. When the FTI phase is
present, it is moderately robust to small interspin interactions; these
introduce competing partially gapped phases of orbital antiferromagnetic and
bond density wave character. Performing a strong coupling analysis of the FTI
precursor regime, we find that the main effect of interspin interactions is to
induce correlated quasiparticle backscattering between the precursor FTI edge
modes. Although this process competes with the topological phase, we show, by
considering an array of ladders, that its influence may disappear upon
approaching the two dimensional case. Considering time-reversal symmetry
breaking perturbations, we also describe a protocol that adiabatically pumps
$1/6$ charge per half-cycle, thus providing a quantized FTI signature arising
already in the single ladder regime.

limit the sensitivity of this endeavor. Additional limitations for ground-based
telescopes arise from residual AO-corrected atmospheric wavefront errors,
generating millisecond-lifetime speckles that average into a halo over a long
exposure. A solution to both of these problems is to use the science camera of
an ExAO system as a wavefront sensor to perform a fast measurement and
correction method to minimize these aberrations as soon as they are detected.
We develop the framework for one such method based on the self-coherent camera

Technique (FAST). We show that with the use of a specially designed coronagraph
and coherent differential imaging algorithm, recording images every few
milliseconds allows for a subtraction of atmospheric and static speckles while
maintaining a close to unity algorithmic exoplanet throughput. Detailed

commonly-used semi-empirical models of tephra thickness distribution. The
method is successfully applied to three tephra thickness and one maximum clast
size datasets of the North Mono and Fogo A tephra deposits. Randomly selected
and localized subsets of these datasets are used as input to evaluate its
performance in cases of sparse observations. The results suggest that
estimating the dispersal axis is a more robust way to constrain the source vent
location with sparse observations. Bootstrap aggregating and examining the
surface of the cost function are proposed to characterize the uncertainty of
the method. Distinctions between the two adopted semi-empirical models of
tephra thickness distribution are discussed. Results from applying the method
to thickness datasets of the Trego Hot Springs and Rockland tephras are
consistent with previous studies, which also provide new estimates on their
total volume. The method is then applied to a series of well-correlated tephra
sub-units preserved within the Wilson Creek Formation to estimate their vent

a potentially useful and powerful tool for the study of tephra fall deposits of

Schwarzschild models, we decompose each of 250 representative present-day
galaxies into four orbital components: cold with strong rotation, warm with
weak rotation, hot with dominant random motion and counter-rotating (CR). We
rebuild the surface brightness ($\Sigma$) of each orbital component and we
present in figures and tables a quantification of their morphologies using the
Sersic index \textit{n}, concentration $C =
\log{(\Sigma_{0.1R_e}/\Sigma_{R_e})}$ and intrinsic flattening
$q_{\mathrm{Re}}$ and $q_{\mathrm{Rmax}}$, with $R_e$ the half-light-radius and
$R_{\mathrm{max}}$ the CALIFA data coverage. We find that: (1) kinematic hotter
components are generally more concentrated and rounder than colder components,
and (2) all components become more concentrated and thicker/rounder in more
massive galaxies; they change from disk-like in low mass late-type galaxies to
bulge-like in high-mass early type galaxies. Our findings suggest that Sersic
\textit{n} is not a good discriminator between rotating bulges and non-rotating
bulges. The luminosity fraction of cold orbits $f_{\rm cold}$ is well
correlated with the photometrically-decomposed disk fraction $f_{\rm disk}$ as
$f_{\mathrm{cold}} = 0.14 + 0.23f_{\mathrm{\mathrm{disk}}}$. Similarly, the hot
orbit fraction $f_{\rm hot}$ is correlated with the bulge fraction $f_{\rm
bulge}$ as $f_{\mathrm{hot}} = 0.19 + 0.31f_{\mathrm{\mathrm{bulge}}}$. The
warm orbits mainly contribute to disks in low-mass late-type galaxies, and to
bulges in high-mass early-type galaxies. The cold, warm, and hot components
generally follow the same morphology ($\epsilon = 1-q_{\rm Rmax}$) versus
kinematics ($\sigma_z^2/\overline{V_{\mathrm{tot}}^2}$) relation as the thin
disk, thick disk/pseudo bulge, and classical bulge identified from cosmological

fairness by equalizing accuracy metrics across groups and has also studied how
datasets affected by historical prejudices may lead to unfair decision

arises when a fairness-adjusted predictor is not actually fair on the target
population due to systematic censoring of training data by existing biased
policies. This scenario is particularly common in the same applications where
fairness is a concern. We characterize theoretically the impact of such
censoring on standard fairness metrics for binary classifiers and provide
criteria for when residual unfairness may or may not appear. We prove that,
under certain conditions, fairness-adjusted classifiers will in fact induce
residual unfairness that perpetuates the same injustices, against the same
groups, that biased the data to begin with, thus showing that even
state-of-the-art fair machine learning can have a ""bias in, bias out"" property.
When certain benchmark data is available, we show how sample reweighting can
estimate and adjust fairness metrics while accounting for censoring. We use
this to study the case of Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) and demonstrate that

to uncertain demand. Many algorithms for constructing sparse flexibility
designs with good theoretical guarantees have been developed for balanced and

demands are independently and identically distributed. In this paper, we relax
these assumptions and consider a general class of production systems. We
construct a simple flexibility design to fulfill $(1-\epsilon)$-fraction of
expected demand with high probability (w.h.p.) where the average degree is
$O(\ln(1/\epsilon))$. To motivate our construction, we first consider a natural
weighted probabilistic construction from Chou et al. (2011) where the degree of
each node is proportional to its expected capacity. However, this strategy is
shown to be sub-optimal. To obtain an optimal construction, we develop a simple
yet effective thresholding scheme. The analysis of our approach extends the
classical analysis of expander graphs by overcoming several technical
difficulties. Our approach may prove useful in other applications that require
expansion properties of graphs with non-uniform degree sequences.

possible mechanism for considerable mass-loss and splitting. We report a search
for spin changes for three large Jupiter-family comets (JFCs): 14P/Wolf,
143P/Kowal-Mrkos, and 162P/Siding Spring. None of the three comets has
detectable period changes, and we set conservative upper limits of 4.2 (14P),
6.6 (143P) and 25 (162P) minutes per orbit. Comparing these results with all
eight other JFCs with measured rotational changes, we deduce that none of the
observed large JFCs experiences significant spin changes. This suggests that
large comet nuclei are less likely to undergo rotationally-driven splitting,
and therefore more likely to survive more perihelion passages than smaller
nuclei. We find supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the cumulative size
distributions of JFCs and dormant comets, as well as in recent numerical
studies of cometary orbital dynamics. We added 143P to the sample of 13 other
JFCs with known albedos and phase-function slopes. This sample shows a possible
correlation of increasing phase-function slopes for larger geometric albedos.
Partly based on findings from recent space missions to JFCs, we hypothesise
that this correlation corresponds to an evolutionary trend for JFCs. We propose
that newly activated JFCs have larger albedos and steeper phase functions,
which gradually decrease due to sublimation-driven erosion. If confirmed, this
could be used to analyse surface erosion from ground and to distinguish between
dormant comets and asteroids.

and codegree conditions; this confirms a conjecture of Morris. As a corollary,
we obtain a sharp threshold for a variant of the graph bootstrap process for
strictly $2$-balanced graphs which generalises a result of Kor\'{a}ndi, Peled
and Sudakov. Our approach involves an application of the differential equations
method.

halo extending outward from the ring to >140 au (>1.4""). We measure the ring's
scattering phase function and polarization fraction over scattering angles of
22-125 deg, showing a preference for forward scattering and a polarization
fraction that peaks at ~30% near the ansae. Modeling of the scattered-light
disk indicates that the ring spans radii of ~60-220 au, has a vertical
thickness similar to that of other resolved dust rings, and contains grains as
small as 1.5 microns in diameter. These models also suggest the grains have a
low porosity, are more likely to consist of carbon than astrosilicates, and
contain significant water ice. The halo has a surface brightness profile
consistent with that expected from grains pushed by radiation pressure from the
main ring onto highly eccentric but still bound orbits. We also briefly
investigate arrangements of a possible inner disk component implied by our
spectral energy distribution models, and speculate about the limitations of Mie

structural connectomes and environment factors or human traits, such as
substance use and cognition. Due to limitations in structural connectome
recovery, previous studies largely focus on functional connectomes. Questions
remain about how well structural connectomes can explain variance in different
human traits. Using a state-of-the-art structural connectome processing
pipeline and a novel dimensionality reduction technique applied to data from
the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show strong relationships between
structural connectomes and various human traits. Our dimensionality reduction
approach uses a tensor characterization of the connectome and relies on a
generalization of principal components analysis. We analyze over 1100 scans for
1076 subjects from the HCP and the Sherbrooke test-retest data set, as well as
$175$ human traits that measure domains including cognition, substance use,
motor, sensory and emotion. We find that structural connectomes are associated
with many traits. Specifically, fluid intelligence, language comprehension, and
motor skills are associated with increased cortical-cortical brain structural
connectivity, while the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are associated
with decreased cortical-cortical connectivity.

widespread technique is Copy Move Forgery CMF. This forgery occurs when parts
of the image are copied and duplicated elsewhere in the same image. There exist
a number of algorithms to detect such a forgery in which the primary step
involved is feature extraction. The feature extraction techniques employed must
have lesser time and space complexity involved for an efficient and faster
processing of media. Also, majority of the existing state of art techniques
often tend to falsely match similar genuine objects as copy move forged during
the detection process. To tackle these problems, the paper proposes a novel

Log polar Transformations to reduce feature vector dimension to one feature per

essential to maintain a confined neighborhood for computing deep feature
correlation given degraded images. This is in contrast to existing practice

super-resolution tasks are conducted. Thanks to the recurrent non-local
operations and correlation propagation, the proposed NLRN achieves superior
results to state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters.

forces G to learn the desired distribution, we provide D with some additional

information about the missingness of the original sample, which is used by D to
focus its attention on the imputation quality of particular components. This

method, which is a recursive extension of maxima hunting (MH), performs
variable selection by identifying the maxima of a relevance function, which
measures the strength of the correlation of the predictor functional variable

selected variable is removed by subtracting the conditional expectation of the
process. The results of an extensive empirical evaluation are used to
illustrate that, in the problems investigated, RMH has comparable or higher

Specifically, they show that no classifier can simultaneously be robust to

this is contrary to the standard notion that on tasks such as image

implicit distributions (i.e., distributions without tractable densities). To
this end, we develop a gradient estimator for implicit distributions based on
Stein's identity and a spectral decomposition of kernel operators, where the
eigenfunctions are approximated by the Nystr\""om method. Unlike the previous
works that only provide estimates at the sample points, our approach directly
estimates the gradient function, thus allows for a simple and principled
out-of-sample extension. We provide theoretical results on the error bound of
the estimator and discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in practice. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applications to gradient-free
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference with implicit distributions.
Finally, we discuss the intuition behind the estimator by drawing connections
between the Nystr\""om method and kernel PCA, which indicates that the estimator
can automatically adapt to the geometry of the underlying distribution.

message within some cover data. The key scope of this work is about visual
steganography techniques that hide a full-sized color image / video within
another. A majority of existing works are devoted to the image case, where both
secret and cover data are images. We empirically validate that image
steganography model does not naturally extend to the video case (i.e., hiding a
video into another video), mainly because it completely ignores the temporal
redundancy within consecutive video frames. Our work proposes a novel solution
to the problem of video steganography. The technical contributions are
two-fold: first, the residual between two consecutive frames tends to zero at
most pixels. Hiding such highly-sparse data is significantly easier than hiding
the original frames. Motivated by this fact, we propose to explicitly consider
inter-frame residuals rather than blindly applying image steganography model on
every video frame. Specifically, our model contains two branches, one of which
is specially designed for hiding inter-frame difference into a cover video
frame and the other instead hides the original secret frame. A simple
thresholding method determines which branch a secret video frame shall choose.
When revealing the concealed secret video, two decoders are devised, revealing
difference or frame respectively. Second, we develop the model based on deep
convolutional neural networks, which is the first of its kind in the literature
of video steganography. In experiments, comprehensive evaluations are conducted
to compare our model with both classic least significant bit (LSB) method and
pure image steganography models. All results strongly suggest that the proposed
model enjoys advantages over previous methods. We also carefully investigate
key factors in the success of our deep video steganography model.

simple 2D chemical model for the formation of DCO$^+$ through the cold
deuteration channel and a parametric treatment of the warm deuteration channel.
We use data from ALMA in band 6 to obtain a resolved spectral imaging data cube
of the DCO$^+$ $J$=3--2 line in HD163296 with a synthesized beam of
0.""53$\times$ 0.""42. We adopt a physical structure of the disk from the
literature that reproduces the spectral energy distribution. We then apply a
simplified chemical network for the formation of DCO$^+$ that uses the physical
structure of the disk as parameters along with a CO abundance profile, a
constant HD abundance and a constant ionization rate. Finally, from the
resulting DCO$^+$ abundances, we calculate the non-LTE emission using the 3D
radiative transfer code LIME. The observed DCO$^+$ emission is reproduced by a
model with cold deuteration producing abundances up to $1.6\times 10^{-11}$.
Warm deuteration, at a constant abundance of $3.2\times 10^{-12}$, becomes
fully effective below 32 K and tapers off at higher temperatures, reproducing
the lack of DCO$^+$ inside 90 AU. Throughout the DCO$^+$ emitting zone a CO
abundance of $2\times 10^{-7}$ is found, with $\sim$99\% of it frozen out below
19 K. At radii where both cold and warm deuteration are active, warm
deuteration contributes up to 20\% of DCO$^+$, consistent with detailed
chemical models. The decrease of DCO$^+$ at large radii is attributed to a
temperature inversion at 250 AU, which raises temperatures above values where
cold deuteration operates. Increased photodesorption may also limit the radial
extent of DCO$^+$. The corresponding return of the DCO$^+$ layer to the
midplane, together with a radially increasing ionization fraction, reproduces
the local DCO$^+$ emission maximum at $\sim$260 AU.

the development of depth sensing and 3D laser scanning techniques. It has
attracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence,
navigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding
of point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the
informative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the
irregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert
point clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding
them into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization
artifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional
neural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on
spectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals
on graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial
approximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that
describes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the
corresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of
dynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss
function, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the
ShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
computational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state
of the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and
point cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to
point cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40

We analyze an asynchronous downlink massive MIMO system in terms of the

tool. For comparison, we also obtain the results for the synchronous systems.
In addition, we investigate the effect of the uplink power control and the
number of pilot symbols on the downlink ergodic rate, and we observe that there
is an optimal value for the number of pilot symbols maximizing the downlink
ergodic rate of a cell. Our results also indicate that, compared to the cases

the uplink power control in the asynchronous mode.

temperatures of small dust grains may not be assumed to be constant. We
simulate a full gas-grain reaction network with a set of dust grain radii using
the classical MRN grain size distribution and include the temperature
fluctuations of small dust grains. Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the
real-time dust grain's temperature fluctuations which is caused by the external
low energy photons and the internal cosmic ray induced secondary photons. The
increase of dust grains radii as ice mantles accumulate on grain surfaces is
also included in our models. We found that surface CO$_2$ abundances in models
with grain size distribution and temperature fluctuations are more than one
order of magnitude larger than those with single grain size. Small amounts of
terrestrial complex organic molecules (COMs) can also be formed on small grains
due to the temperature spikes induced by external low energy photons. However,
cosmic ray induced secondary photons overheat small grains so that surface CO
sublime and less radicals are formed on grains surfaces, thus the production of
surface CO$_2$ and COMs decreases by about one order of magnitude. The
overheating of small grains can be offset by grain growth so that the formation
of surface CO$_2$ and COMs becomes more efficient.

affine homomorphisms between two finite groups, $G$ and $H$, generalizing
Hadamard codes. Following the work of Goldreich--Levin (1989), Grigorescu et
al. (2006), Dinur et al. (2008), and Guo and Sudan (2014), we further expand
the range of groups for which local list-decoding is possible up to
$\textsf{mindist}$, the minimum distance of the code. In particular, for the
first time, we do not require either $G$ or $H$ to be solvable. Specifically,
we demonstrate a $\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ bound on the list size,
i.e., on the number of codewords within distance
$(\textsf{mindist}-\varepsilon)$ from any received word, when $G$ is either
abelian or an alternating group, and $H$ is an arbitrary (finite or infinite)
group. We conjecture that a similar bound holds for all finite simple groups as
domains; the alternating groups serve as the first test case.
  The abelian vs. arbitrary result then permits us to adapt previous techniques
to obtain efficient local list-decoding for this case. We also obtain efficient
local list-decoding for the permutation representations of alternating groups
(i.e., when the codomain is a symmetric group $S_m$) under the restriction that
the domain $G=A_n$ is paired with codomain $H=S_m$ satisfying $m <
2^{n-1}/\sqrt{n}$.
  The limitations on the codomain in the latter case arise from severe
technical difficulties stemming from the need to solve the homomorphism
extension (HomExt) problem in certain cases; these are addressed in a separate
paper (Wuu 2018).
  However, we also introduce an intermediate ""semi-algorithmic"" model we call
Certificate List-Decoding that bypasses the HomExt bottleneck and works in the
alternating vs. arbitrary setting. A certificate list-decoder produces partial
homomorphisms that uniquely extend to the homomorphisms in the list.

sensor independent quality features on a local level containing minute details

power supplies of RF tags rely on ambient RF energy harvesting. Consequently,
sparse-coded backscatter modulation algorithm (SC-BMA) can enable
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as well as M-ary modulation for
concurrent backscatter transmissions, providing additional diversity gain.
These sparse codewords from multiple tags can be efficiently detected at access
point (AP) using iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). To overcome DBC

algorithm (D-CEA) and dyadic MPA (D-MPA) exploiting weighted-sum of the ISI for

of the SC-AmBC in terms of connectivity, detection performance and sum

to frame a resource-bounded adversary so that it can be severely detrimental to

  We suggest a formal answer for losses that satisfy the minimal statistical

measure of ""harmfulness"" which generalizes the well-known class of integral
probability metrics. A key feature of our result is that it holds for all
proper losses, and for a popular subset of these, the optimisation of this
central measure appears to be independent of the loss. When classifiers are
Lipschitz -- a now popular approach in adversarial training --, this
optimisation resorts to optimal transport to make a low-budget compression of
class marginals. Toy experiments reveal a finding recently separately observed:
training against a sufficiently budgeted adversary of this kind improves

during training process. (2) A huge domain gap exists between this dataset and
ImageNet. We propose to deal with the unbalanced loss by employing a double
margin contrastive loss. We tackle the domain gap issue with a two-stage
training strategy, where we first fine-tune the network for classification, and
then fine-tune it for retrieval. Experimental results show that our approach
outperforms the conventional single margin approach by a large margin (up to
88.5% relative improvement) and even surpasses the strong triplet-loss-based
approach.

interest in using RL for continuous-time control of physical systems (cf. many
challenging tasks in OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite). Since
discretization of time is susceptible to error, it is methodologically more
desirable to handle the system dynamics directly in continuous time. However,
very few techniques exist for continuous-time RL and they lack flexibility in
value function approximation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for
model-based continuous-time value function approximation in reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces. The resulting framework is so flexible that it can accommodate
any kind of kernel-based approach, such as Gaussian processes and kernel
adaptive filters, and it allows us to handle uncertainties and nonstationarity
without prior knowledge about the environment or what basis functions to
employ. We demonstrate the validity of the presented framework through

charge separation in proteins at the photosystem II reaction center. Here, we
investigate the impacts of the protein environment and intramolecular
vibrations on primary charge separation at the photosystem II reaction center.
This is accomplished by combining the quantum dynamic theories of condensed
phase electron transfer with quantum chemical calculations to evaluate the
vibrational Huang-Rhys factors of chlorophyll and pheophytin molecules. We
report that individual vibrational modes play a minor role in promoting the
charge separation, contrary to the discussion in recent publications.
Nevertheless, these small contributions accumulate to considerably influence
the charge separation rate, resulting in sub-picosecond charge separation
almost independent of the driving force and temperature. We suggest that the
intramolecular vibrations complement the robustness of the charge separation in
the photosystem II reaction center against the inherently large static disorder

so, we can better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or
closed, instead of in a middle state, which makes the results more
interpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems that we
restrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better or
comparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The

accepted in place of on-site practical work when realistic activities are

disorder in a higher WN next nearest neighbor XY model. When disorder becomes
strong enough, Majorana edge modes become critically extended, beyond which
they collapse into Anderson localized (AL) states in the bulk, resulting in a
topological Anderson insulating state (TAI). We identify a resilience threshold
$W_t$ for every pair of Majorana fermions (MFs). In response to increasing
disorder every pair of MFs collapse into AL bulk at their resilience threshold.
For very strong disorder, all Majorana fermions collapse and a topologically
trivial state is obtained. We show that the threshold values are deeply related
to the localization length of Majorana fermions, which can be efficiently
calculated by an appropriate modification of the transfer matrix method. At the
topological transition point, localization length of the zero modes diverges
and the system becomes scale invariant. The number of peaks in the localization
length as the function of disorder strength determines the number of zero modes
in the clean state before disorder is introduced. This finding elevates the
transfer matrix method to the level of a tool for determination of the
topological index of both clean and disordered systems.

training, we define novelty metrics based on the (partially complementary)
assumptions that the VAE is less capable of reconstructing abnormal samples
well; that abnormal samples more strongly violate the VAE regularizer; and that
abnormal samples differ from normal samples not only in input-feature space,

with various possibilities of using (e.g. sampling) the probabilistic VAE to
obtain scalar novelty scores, yield a large family of methods. We apply these

that the spectral profiles of the star light polarization peaks observed in the

the range of Rayleigh's approximation. The silicate properties are those
obtained experimentally by Scott and Duley \cite{sco} for the non-iron bearing
\bf amorphous \rm forsterite and enstatite. The whole range of observed
Serkowski polarization profiles can be simulated with mixtures made of
forsterite plus an increasing fraction (0 to 0.5) of enstatite as the spectral
peak shifts from 0.8 to 0.3 $\mu$m. Fits to individual observed polarization
spectra are also demonstrated. The optical extinction of silicates in the
vis/IR (the ""transparency range"") can be understood by analogy with the
thoroughly studied amorphous hydrogenated carbons and amorphous silica. It is
due to structural disorder (dangling bonds and coordination defects) and
impurities, which give rise to electronic states in the forbidden gap of
semi-conductors. Because they are partially localized, their extinction power
is dramatically reduced and has been ignored or simply described by a low, flat
plateau. As their number density depends on the environment, one expects
variations in the ratio of optical extinction coefficients in the visible and

  $$\mathrm{vol}(L)\ge 2n! h^0_a(X,L).$$ In this paper we characterize

and the TCI are protected by the mirror and inversion symmetries, for which we
define the bulk topological numbers of the same type. We take examples of
square nanodisks on the square lattice and hexagonal nanodisks on the
triangular lattice. When inplane magnetic field is introduced parallel to one
of the helical edges, the system becomes a TCI. The conductance along the edge
is 1 in the unit of the conductance quantum $e^2/h$. As the inplane field is
rotated, the conductance decreases as the gap of the edge states opens. When it
becomes orthogonal to a diagonal line, two topological corner states emerge on
its vertices and the system becomes a SOTI. When it becomes parallel to another
edge, the system becomes again a TCI and the conductance along the original
edge becomes 0 but 1 along a new edge. This may be used as a basis of a
topological circuit changing switch. Alternatively, the device may be used as a
sensor to measure local magnetization on a sample surface with a resolution of

on the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of a hot QCD matter and then
explored these effects on the subsequent hydrodynamic expansion of the said
matter once produced in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. For that
purpose, we have computed the quark and gluon self-energies up to one loop in
the strong magnetic field, using the HTL approximation with two hard scales -
temperature and magnetic field, which in turn compute the effective propagators
for quarks and gluons, respectively. Hence the quark and gluon contributions to
the free energy are obtained from the respective propagators and finally derive
the equation of state (EOS) by calculating the pressure and energy density. We
have found that the speed of sound is enhanced due to the presence of strong
magnetic field and this effect will be later exploited in the hydrodynamics.
Thereafter the magnetic properties are studied from the free energy of the
matter, where the magnetization is found to increase linearly with the magnetic
field, thus hints the paramagnetic behavior. The temperature dependence of the
magnetization is also studied, where the magnetization is found to increase
slowly with the temperature. Finally, to see how a strong magnetic field could
affect the hydrodynamic evolution, we have revisited the Bjorken
boost-invariant picture with our paramagnetic EOS as an input in the equation
of motion for the energy-momentum conservation. We have noticed that the energy
density evolves faster than in the absence of strong magnetic field, i.e.
cooling becomes faster, which could have implications on the heavy-ion
phenomenology. As mentioned earlier, this observation can be understood by the
enhancement of the speed of sound.

research was performed in the catchment of the Schwabach River, a small,
karstic headwater stream in Germany. The DIC data indicated the dominance of
mineral weathering as a DIC source, with a dilution effect during high flow
periods. A weakly negative relationship between discharge and d13CDIC indicates
an increase in plant-derived organic matter during floods, transported to river
waters via overland runoff and intermediate flow. DOC inputs were enhanced
during periods of high discharge, indicating a greater importance of overland
runoff as a DOC source. POC concentrations seem unaffected by discharge, but a
slight negative correlation between d13CPOC and discharge may be derived from
increased C4 plant material inputs. CO2 concentrations exceeded ambient
atmospheric values throughout the year, confirming that the river surface
waters are a net CO2 source. The total riverine carbon flux was dominated by
DIC (70%), followed by CO2 efflux (21%), DOC (7%), and POC (2%). While a
bi-monthly sampling scheme yielded a similar carbon flux estimate to that
utilizing the entire dataset, the use of a monthly sampling interval differed
by up to 19%. This discrepancy is due to the inability of a monthly sampling
scheme to capture sudden and large variations in river discharge and associated
dissolved/particulate carbon concentration changes, such as those observed
during flooding. Bi-monthly sampling may be the minimum timeframe required for
an acceptable degree of accuracy in carbon flux calculations. The application
of high sampling frequencies and comprehensive DIC, DOC, and POC studies in
future research would reduce uncertainties in riverine carbon budgets, and
clarify the role of small streams in the global carbon cycle.

position in the colon by registering a colonoscope shape and a colon shape. The
colonoscope shape is obtained using an electromagnetic sensor, and the colon
shape is obtained from a CT volume. However, large tracking errors were
observed due to colon deformations occurred during colonoscope insertions. Such
deformations make the registration difficult. Because the colon deformation is
caused by a colonoscope, there is a strong relationship between the colon
deformation and the colonoscope shape. An estimation method of colon
deformations occur during colonoscope insertions is necessary to reduce
tracking errors. We propose a colon deformation estimation method. This method
is used to estimate a deformed colon shape from a colonoscope shape. We use the
regression forests algorithm to estimate a deformed colon shape. The regression
forests algorithm is trained using pairs of colon and colonoscope shapes, which
contains deformations occur during colonoscope insertions. As a preliminary

fundamental accelerating harmonic and the second harmonic in a single wideband
magnetic alloy (MA) cavity, and the multiharmonic rf feedforward to compensate
the beam loading in the MA cavity caused by high intensity beams. These
functions are necessary to accelerate high intensity proton beams. The system
has been working well without major problems for more than ten years. However,
the old FPGAs (Xilinx Virtex-II pro etc.) are discontinued and not supported by
the current development environment. It will be difficult to maintain the
system in near future. Thus, we are planning to replace the existing VME-based
LLRF control system with a new MicroTCA.4 based system. The system controls
twelve cavities independently and calculates vector sum of the cavity voltages
in real time for phase feedback. Signal and data transfer between the modules
is a key to realize the functions. In the existing system, the transfer is
implemented not only the backplane but also serial link via cables between the
VME modules. It is much more simplified in the new system thanks to the high

and 300 K. Due to the extremely small sample size at such record pressures the
measurements were limited to Raman spectroscopy. The experimental data on
increase of pressure shows decreasing Raman activity and darkening of the
sample, which suggests band-gap closure and impending molecular dissociation,
but no definite conclusions could be reached. Furthermore, the available data
is insufficient to determine the structure of phase V, which remains unknown.
Introducing saddle-point $ab$ $initio$ random structure searching (sp-AIRSS),
we find several new structural candidates of hydrogen which could describe the
observed properties of phase V. We investigate hydrogen metallisation in the
proposed candidate structures, and demonstrate that smaller band gaps are
associated with longer bond lengths. We conclude that phase V is a stepping

the so-called Applegate mechanism, where a strong, variable magnetic field can

thus causing observable period changes. One of the systems exhibiting such
strong orbital variations is the RS CVn binary HR 1099, whose activity cycle
has been studied by various authors via photospheric and chromospheric activity
indicators, resulting in contradicting periods. We aim at independently
determining the magnetic activity cycle of HR 1099 using archival X-ray data to
allow for a comparison to orbital period variations. Archival X-ray data from
80 different observations of HR 1099 acquired with 12 different X-ray
facilities and covering almost four decades were used to determine X-ray fluxes
in the energy range of 2-10 keV via spectral fitting and flux conversion. Via
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram we analyze the resulting long-term X-ray light
curve to search for periodicities. We do not detect any statistically
significant periodicities within the X-ray data. An analysis of optical data of
HR 1099 shows that the derivation of such periods is strongly dependent on the
time coverage of available data, since the observed optical variations strongly
deviate from a pure sine wave. We argue that this offers an explanation as to
why other authors derive such a wide range of activity cycle periods based on
optical data. We conclude that our analysis constitutes the longest stellar
X-ray activity light curve acquired to date, yet the still rather sparse
sampling of the X-ray data, along with stochastic flaring activity, does not

operating temperature of an individual cell. We have developed a new approach
to measuring the effective molecular temperature inside a gas absorption cell
and searching for effects detrimental to a high precision wavelength reference,
utilizing the Boltzmann distribution of relative line depths within absorption
bands of single vibrational transitions. With a high resolution Fourier
transform spectrometer, we took a series of 632 spectra at temperatures between
23{\deg}C and 66{\deg}C. These spectra provide a sufficient basis to test the
algorithm and demonstrate the stability and repeatability of the temperature
determination via molecular lines on a single iodine absorption cell. The
achievable radial velocity precision is found to be independent of the cell
temperature and a detailed analysis shows a wavelength dependency, which
originates in the resolving power of the spectrometer in use and the
signal-to-noise ratio. Two effects were found to cause apparent absolute shifts
in radial velocity, a temperature-induced shift of the order of 1 m/s/K and a
more significant effect resulting in abrupt jumps of 50 m/s is determined to be
caused by the temperature crossing the dew point of the molecular iodine.

computational difficulties due to the non-differentiable definition of the
stress tensor in the plug regions, i.e. where the strain-rate tensor vanishes,
is overcome by using a projection formulation as in the Uzawa-like method for
viscoplastic flows. This projection definition of the plastic tensor is coupled
with a fractional time-stepping scheme designed for Newtonian incompressible
flows with variable density. The plastic tensor is treated implicitly in the
first sub-step of the fractional time-stepping scheme and a fixed-point
iterative procedure is used for its computation. A pseudo-time relaxation term
is added into the Bingham projection whose effect is to ensure a geometric
convergence of the fixed-point algorithm. This is a key feature of the
bi-projection scheme which provides a fast and accurate computation of the
plastic tensor. Stability and error analyses of the bi-projection scheme are
provided. The use of the discrete divergence-free velocity to convect the
density in the mass conservation equation allows us to derive lower and upper
bounds for the discrete density. The error induced by the pseudo-time
relaxation term is controlled by a prescribed numerical parameter so that a
first-order estimate of the time error is derived for the velocity field and
the density, as well as the dependent parameters that are the plastic viscosity

short-term neurological outcome in preterm infants less than 32 weeks
gestational age (GA). The predictive power of common HRV features with respect
to the outcome is assessed and shown to improve when HRV is observed during
episodes of low mean arterial pressure (MAP) - with a single best feature
leading to an AUC of 0.87. Combining multiple features with a boosted decision
tree classifier achieves an AUC of 0.97. The work presents a promising step
towards the use of multimodal data in building an objective decision support
tool for clinical prediction of short-term outcome in preterms who suffer
episodes of low BP.

This study explores alternative sound-based methods for EEG interpretation
which are designed to allow for intuitive and quick differentiation between
healthy background activity and abnormal activity such as seizures. A novel
method based on frequency and amplitude modulation (FM/AM) is presented. The
algorithm is tuned to facilitate the audio domain perception of rhythmic
activity which is specific to neonatal seizures. The method is compared with
the previously developed phase vocoder algorithm for different time compressing
factors. A survey is conducted amongst a cohort of non-EEG experts to
quantitatively and qualitatively examine the performance of sound-based methods
in comparison with the visual interpretation. It is shown that both
sonification methods perform similarly well, with a smaller inter-observer
variability in comparison with visual. A post-survey analysis of results is
performed by examining the sensitivity of the ear to frequency evolution in
audio.

analyzing physical systems by either solving the differential equations
modeling their dynamics or by evaluating their transfer function. The dynamics
of the given system are firstly modeled using differential equations and then
Laplace transform is applied to convert these differential equations to their
equivalent algebraic equations. These equations can further be simplified to
either obtain the transfer function of the system or to find out the solution
of the differential equations in frequency domain. Next, the uniqueness of the
Laplace transform provides the solution of these differential equations in the
time domain. The traditional Laplace transform based analysis techniques, i.e.,
paper-and-pencil proofs and computer simulation methods are error-prone due to
their inherent limitations and thus are not suitable for the analysis of the
systems. Higher-order-logic theorem proving can overcome these limitations of
these techniques and can ascertain accurate analysis of the systems. In this
paper, we extend our higher-order logic formalization of the Laplace transform,
which includes the formal definition of the Laplace transform and verification
of its various classical properties. One of the main contributions of the paper
is the formalization of Lerch's theorem, which describes the uniqueness of the
Laplace transform and thus plays a vital role in solving linear differential
equations in the frequency domain. For illustration, we present the formal
analysis of a $4$-$\pi$ soft error crosstalk model, which is widely used in
nanometer technologies, such as, Integrated Circuits (ICs).

photons with respect to softer ones and the photon index of the hard X-ray
power law. The correlation is not very tight and therefore it is necessary to
examine it source by source. The objective of the present work is to
investigate in detail the time-lag -- photon-index correlation in GX 339-4. We
have obtained RXTE energy spectra and light curves and have computed the photon
index and the time lag of the $9 - 15$ keV photons with respect to the $2 - 6$
keV ones. The observations cover the first stages of the hard state, the pure
hard state, and the hard-intermediate state. At low $\Gamma$, the correlation
is positive and it becomes negative at large $\Gamma$. By assuming that the
hard X-ray power law index $\Gamma$ is produced by inverse Compton scattering
of soft disk photons in the jet, we have reproduced the entire correlation by
varying two parameters in the jet: the radius of the jet at its base $R_0$ and
the Thomson optical depth along the jet $\tau_\parallel$. We have found that,
as the luminosity of the source increases, $R_0$ initially increases and then
decreases. This behavior is expected in the context of the Cosmic Battery. As a
further test of our model, we predict the break frequency in the radio spectrum
as a function of the photon index during the rising part of an outburst.

The current business processes must also be redesigned and innovated to enable

contribution on how blockchain technology and smart contracts potentially can,
within the framework of the seven principles of business process re-engineering

enhances the frequency translation range, without excessive power consumption.
A 5-GHz digital phase locked loop (DPLL) with switched loop, incorporating this

DTC is able to perform fractional shift upto 80MHz with 100MHz reference clock,
using 3mW of power from 1.2V supply. A simple look-up table based
foreground-calibration of phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) in DDS improves
the peak INL of the DTC to 0.25ps. Hence, with the proposed DTC and a

deals with plasmonic assisted emission properties of Au NPs-vertical graphene

on the surface enhanced Raman scattering and luminescence properties is
investigated. In addition, a remarkable infra-red (IR) emission in the hybrid
nanostructures is observed and interpreted on the basis of intra-band
transitions in Au NPs. The flake-like nanoporous VG structure is invoked for
the generation of additional confined photons to impart additional momentum and
a gradient of confined excitation energy towards initiating the intra-band
transitions of Au NPs. Integrating Au plasmonic materials in three-dimensional
VG nanostructures enhances the light-matter interactions. The present study
provides a new adaptable plasmonic assisted pathway for optoelectronic and

average composition of clusters with ages >0.1 Gyr. We derived statistical ages
and distances of field stars, and we separated them in thin and thick disc
populations. We studied the time evolution and dependence on metallicity of
abundance ratios using open clusters and field stars. Using our large and
homogeneous sample of open clusters, thin and thick disc stars, spanning an age
range larger than 10 Gyr, we confirm an increase towards young ages of
s-process abundances in the Solar neighbourhood. These trends are well defined
for open clusters and stars located nearby the solar position and they may be
explained by a late enrichment due to significant contribution to the
production of these elements from long-living low-mass stars. At the same time,
we found a strong dependence of the s-process abundance ratios with the
Galactocentric distance and with the metallicity of the clusters and field
stars. Our results, derived from the largest and homogeneous sample of
s-process abundances in the literature, confirm the growth with decreasing
stellar ages of the s-process abundances in both field and open cluster stars.
At the same time, taking advantage of the abundances of open clusters located
in a wide Galactocentric range, they open a new view on the dependence of the
s-process evolution on the metallicity and star formation history, pointing to
different behaviours at various Galactocentric distances.

making use of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) formalism, we also show that
the DGT and total parts of the neutrinoless double-beta decay NMEs are in
linear correlation with DCE-DGT NMEs. This confirms the hypothesis of a linear
correlation between them, as introduced in [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf 120},

dispersion of the miniband, which can be fine tuned by the real and imaginary
components of the potential. As a result, the condensate can be formed in a
$0$-state, $\pi$-state, or mixed state of spatiotemporal intermittency,
depending on the shape of the miniband, strength of interparticle interaction,
and distribution of losses in the system. The reconstruction of the condensate
wave function takes place by proliferation of nuclei of the new condensate
phase in the form of dark solitons. We show that, in general, the interacting

12 standard type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} X-ray bursts and an
irregular X-ray burst which lacks cooling tail. During the outburst, the
persistent emission occurred at $\sim$(1-5)$\%\rm {\dot{M}_{Edd}}$. We use a
combination model of a blackbody (BB), a powerlaw, and a line component to fit
the persistent emission spectra. Another BB is added into the combination model
to account for the emission of the X-ray bursts due to the thermonuclear
burning on the surface of the neutron star. Finally, we modify the combination
model with a multiplicative factor $f_{\rm a}$, plus a BB to fit the spectra
during the X-ray bursts. It is found that the $f_{\rm a}$ is inversely
correlated with the burst flux in some cases. Our analysis suggests that the
ignition depth of the irregular X-ray burst is obviously smaller than those of
the type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} X-ray bursts. We argue that the
detected type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} X-ray bursts originate
from helium-rich or pure-helium environment, while the irregular X-ray burst
originates from the thermonuclear flash in a shallow ocean.

under unconstrained settings remains challenging. Issues like profile views,
unfavorable lighting, and occlusions can cause substantial difficulties.
Previous works have attempted to tackle this problem by exploiting the context,
e.g. clothes and social relations. While showing promising improvement, they
are usually limited in two important aspects, relying on simple heuristics to
combine different cues and separating the construction of context from people
identities. In this work, we aim to move beyond such limitations and propose a
new framework to leverage context for person recognition. In particular, we
propose a Region Attention Network, which is learned to adaptively combine
visual cues with instance-dependent weights. We also develop a unified
formulation, where the social contexts are learned along with the reasoning of
people identities. These models substantially improve the robustness when
working with the complex contextual relations in unconstrained environments. On
two large datasets, PIPA and Cast In Movies (CIM), a new dataset proposed in

reveal an edge-localized behavior in the radial mode structure as the azimuthal

between the global dispersion relation and its local approximation from the

are used to solve incompressible turbulent flow problems. In the compressible
case, the Mach number is then considered as a solver parameter that is set to a
small value, $\mathrm{M}\approx 0.1$, in order to mimic incompressible flows.
This strategy is widely used for high-order discontinuous Galerkin
discretizations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The present work
raises the question regarding the computational efficiency of compressible DG
solvers as compared to a genuinely incompressible formulation. Our
contributions to the state-of-the-art are twofold: Firstly, we present a
high-performance discontinuous Galerkin solver for the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations based on a highly efficient matrix-free implementation
that targets modern cache-based multicore architectures. The performance
results presented in this work focus on the node-level performance and our
results suggest that there is great potential for further performance
improvements for current state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin
implementations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Secondly, this
compressible Navier-Stokes solver is put into perspective by comparing it to an
incompressible DG solver that uses the same matrix-free implementation. We
discuss algorithmic differences between both solution strategies and present an
in-depth numerical investigation of the performance. The considered benchmark
test cases are the three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex problem as a
representative of transitional flows and the turbulent channel flow problem as
a representative of wall-bounded turbulent flows.

external magnetic field leads to a synchronization of the spin dynamics with
the optical excitation. The pumped electron spins partially rephase prior to
each laser pulse, causing a revival of electron spin polarization with its
maximum at the incidence time of a laser pulse. The amplitude of this revival
is amplified by the frequency focusing of the surrounding nuclear spins. Two
complementary theoretical approaches for simulating up to 20 million laser
pulses are developed and employed that are able to bridge between 11 orders of
magnitude in time: a fully quantum mechanical description limited to small
nuclear bath sizes and a technique based on the classical equations of motion
applicable for a large number of nuclear spins. We present experimental data of
the nonmonotonic revival amplitude as function of the magnetic field applied
perpendicular to the optical axis. The dependence of the revival amplitude on
the external field with a profound minimum at $4\;$T is reproduced by both of
our theoretical approaches and is ascribed to the nuclear Zeeman effect. Since
the nuclear Larmor precession determines the electronic resonance condition, it
also defines the number of electron spin revolutions between pump pulses, the
orientation of the electron spin at the incidence time of a pump pulse, and the
resulting revival amplitude. The magnetic field of $4\;$T, for example,
corresponds to half a revolution of nuclear spins between two laser pulses.

strategy to speed up these flows, which consists in including contact-averse
entities in the assembly. On the basis of a minimal cellular automaton and a
continuous agent-based model for pedestrian evacuation dynamics, we find that
the inclusion of polite pedestrians amid a given competitive crowd fails to
reduce the evacuation time when the constriction (the doorway) is acceptably
large. This is not surprising, because adding agents makes the crowd larger. In
contrast, when the door is so narrow that it can accommodate at most one or two
agents at a time, our strategy succeeds in substantially curbing long-lived
clogs and speeding up the evacuation. A similar effect is seen experimentally
in a vibrated two-dimensional hopper flow with an opening narrower than 3 disk
diameters. Indeed, by adding to the initial collection of neutral disks a large
fraction of magnetic ones, interacting repulsively, we observe a shortening of
the time intervals between successive egresses of neutral disks, as reflected
by the study of their probability distribution. On a more qualitative note, our
study suggests that the much discussed analogy between pedestrian flows and

be formulated as a problem of network inference - or network reconstruction -
for which the Gaussian graphical model (GGM) provides a canonical framework.
Unfortunately, the Gaussian assumption does not apply to count data which are
encountered in domains such as genomics, social sciences or ecology.
  To circumvent this limitation, state-of-the-art approaches use two-step
strategies that first transform counts to pseudo Gaussian observations and then
apply a (partial) correlation-based approach from the abundant literature of
GGM inference. We adopt a different stance by relying on a latent model where
we directly model counts by means of Poisson distributions that are conditional
to latent (hidden) Gaussian correlated variables. In this multivariate Poisson
lognormal-model, the dependency structure is completely captured by the latent
layer. This parametric model enables to account for the effects of covariates
on the counts.
  To perform network inference, we add a sparsity inducing constraint on the
inverse covariance matrix of the latent Gaussian vector. Unlike the usual
Gaussian setting, the penalized likelihood is generally not tractable, and we
resort instead to a variational approach for approximate likelihood
maximization. The corresponding optimization problem is solved by alternating a
gradient ascent on the variational parameters and a graphical-Lasso step on the
covariance matrix.
  We show that our approach is highly competitive with the existing methods on
simulation inspired from microbiological data. We then illustrate on three
various data sets how accounting for sampling efforts via offsets and
integrating external covariates (which is mostly never done in the existing
literature) drastically changes the topology of the inferred network.

  Transactions on Vehicular Technology, June 2018",,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile-edge cloud computing is a new paradigm to provide cloud computing
capabilities at the edge of pervasive radio access networks in close proximity
to mobile users. Aiming at provisioning flexible on-demand mobile-edge cloud
service, in this paper we propose a comprehensive framework consisting of a
resource-efficient computation offloading mechanism for users and a joint
communication and computation (JCC) resource allocation mechanism for network
operator. Specifically, we first study the resource-efficient computation
offloading problem for a user, in order to reduce user's resource occupation by
determining its optimal communication and computation resource profile with
minimum resource occupation and meanwhile satisfying the QoS constraint. We
then tackle the critical problem of user admission control for JCC resource
allocation, in order to properly select the set of users for resource demand
satisfaction. We show the admission control problem is NP-hard, and hence
develop an efficient approximation solution of a low complexity by carefully
designing the user ranking criteria and rigourously derive its performance
guarantee. To prevent the manipulation that some users may untruthfully report
their valuations in acquiring mobile-edge cloud service, we further resort to
the powerful tool of critical value approach to design truthful pricing scheme
for JCC resource allocation. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed schemes can achieve superior performance for on-demand mobile-edge
cloud computing.

  IJCNN, 2018",,,,"stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Text classification has become indispensable due to the rapid increase of
text in digital form. Over the past three decades, efforts have been made to
approach this task using various learning algorithms and statistical models
based on bag-of-words (BOW) features. Despite its simple implementation, BOW
features lack semantic meaning representation. To solve this problem, neural
networks started to be employed to learn word vectors, such as the word2vec.
Word2vec embeds word semantic structure into vectors, where the angle between
vectors indicates the meaningful similarity between words. To measure the
similarity between texts, we propose the novel concept of word subspace, which
can represent the intrinsic variability of features in a set of word vectors.
Through this concept, it is possible to model text from word vectors while
holding semantic information. To incorporate the word frequency directly in the
subspace model, we further extend the word subspace to the term-frequency (TF)
weighted word subspace. Based on these new concepts, text classification can be
performed under the mutual subspace method (MSM) framework. The validity of our
modeling is shown through experiments on the Reuters text database, comparing
the results to various state-of-art algorithms.

two contributions: a ferromagnetic part stemming from the symmetrized

this anti-ferromagnetic contribution can also be generated by an effective
local tunneling term between the two impurities. This tunneling can be
analytically calculated for particle-hole symmetric impurities. Replacing the
full hybridization functions by the symmetric part and this tunneling term
leads to the identical low-temperature fixed point spectrum in the numerical
renormalization group. Compensating this tunneling term is used to restore the
Varma-Jones quantum critical point between a strong coupling phase and a local
singlet phase even in the absence of particle-hole symmetry in the
hybridization functions. We analytically investigate the spatial frequencies of
the effective tunneling term based on the combination of the band dispersion
and the shape of the Fermi surface. Numerical renormalization group

  time distributions",,,,,"q-bio.CB math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cell proliferation is typically incorporated into stochastic mathematical
models of cell migration by assuming that cell divisions occur after an
exponentially distributed waiting time. Experimental observations, however,
show that this assumption is often far from the real cell cycle time
distribution (CCTD). Recent studies have suggested an alternative approach to
modelling cell proliferation based on a multi-stage representation of the CCTD.
In order to validate and parametrise these models, it is important to connect
them to experimentally measurable quantities. In this paper we investigate the
connection between the CCTD and the speed of the collective invasion. We first
state a result for a general CCTD, which allows the computation of the invasion
speed using the Laplace transform of the CCTD. We use this to deduce the range
of speeds for the general case. We then focus on the more realistic case of
multi-stage models, using both a stochastic agent-based model and a set of
reaction-diffusion equations for the cells' average density. By studying the
corresponding travelling wave solutions, we obtain an analytical expression for
the speed of invasion for a general N-stage model with identical transition
rates, in which case the resulting cell cycle times are Erlang distributed. We
show that, for a general N-stage model, the Erlang distribution and the
exponential distribution lead to the minimum and maximum invasion speed,
respectively. This result allows us to determine the range of possible invasion
speeds in terms of the average proliferation time for any multi-stage model.

thought to play a role in determining magnetic behavior. Bulk studies of MnV2O4
have yielded conflicting and inconclusive results, due in part to the presence
of mesoscale magnetic inhomogeneity, which complicates the interpretation of
bulk measurements. To study the sub-micron-scale magnetic properties of
Mn-based spinel materials, we performed magnetic force microscopy (MFM) on
MnV2O4 samples subject to different levels of mechanical strain. We also used a
crystal grain mapping technique to perform spatially registered MFM on Mn3O4.
These local investigations revealed 100-nm-scale ""stripe"" modulations in the
magnetic structure of both materials. In MnV2O4, the magnetization of these
stripes is estimated to be Mz $\approx$ 105 A/m, which is on the order of the
saturation magnetization reported previously. Cooling in a strong magnetic
field eliminated the stripe patterning only in the low-strain sample of MnV2O4.
The discovery of nanoscale magnetostructural inhomogeneity that is highly
susceptible to magnetic field control in these materials necessitates both a

also provide explicit asympto-tic solutions for thin sectors. When the

predict correctly the number and the wavelength of the creases, which turn out

security and privacy risks to users, e.g., by revealing the full membership of

configuration the sender used. We propose that future encrypted data formats
improve security and privacy hygiene by producing $\textit{Padded Uniform

to anyone without a decryption key. A PURB's content leaks $\textit{nothing at
all}$, even the application that created it, and is padded such that even its
length leaks as little as possible. Encoding and decoding ciphertexts with
$\textit{no}$ cleartext markers presents efficiency challenges, however. We
present cryptographically agile encodings enabling legitimate recipients to
decrypt a PURB efficiently, even when encrypted for any number of recipients'
public keys and/or passwords, and when these public keys are from different
cryptographic suites. PURBs employ Padm\'e, a~novel padding scheme that limits
information leakage via ciphertexts of maximum length $M$ to a practical

follows from a boundary action, is necessary in order to have well defined
canonical generators of the boundary magnetic symmetries. In this way, both
electric and magnetic soft modes are encoded in a boundary gauge field and its
conjugate dual. This implementation of the electromagnetic duality has striking
consequences. In particular, we show first how the electric charge quantization
follows straightforwardly from the topological properties of the $U(1)$-bundle
of the boundary dual potential. Moreover, having a well defined canonical
action of the electric and magnetic symmetry generators on the phase space, we
can compute their algebra and reveal the presence of a central charge between
them. We conclude with possible implications of these results in the quantum

The increase in sensitivity of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes (IACTs) has lead to numerous detections of extended $\gamma$-ray
sources at TeV energies, sometimes of sizes comparable to the instrument's
field of view (FoV). This creates a demand for advanced and flexible data
analysis methods, able to extract source information by utilising the photon
counts in the entire FoV.
  Aims. We present a new software package, ""SkyPrism"", aimed at performing 2D
(3D if energy is considered) fits of IACT data, possibly containing multiple
and extended sources, based on sky images binned in energy. Though the
development of this package was focused on the analysis of data collected with
the MAGIC telescopes, it can further be adapted to other instruments, such as
the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
  Methods. We have developed a set of tools that, apart from sky images (count
maps), compute the instrument response functions (IRFs) of MAGIC (effective
exposure throughout the FoV, point spread function (PSF), energy resolution and
background shape), based on the input data, Monte-Carlo simulations and the
pointing track of the telescopes. With this information, the presented package
can perform a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit of source models of arbitrary
morphology to the sky images providing energy spectra, detection significances,
and upper limits.
  Results. We demonstrate that the SkyPrism tool accurately reconstructs the
MAGIC PSF, on and off-axis performance as well as the underlying background. We
further show that for a point source analysis with MAGIC's default
observational settings, SkyPrism gives results compatible with those of the
standard tools while being more flexible and widely applicable.

  Partially-Premixed Flames","37th International Combustion Symposium",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The response to small perturbations of the Sandia CH4/air flame series is
studied using a dynamical systems formula- tion. Here, the Sandia D and E
turbulent partially-premixed flames are computed using large eddy simulation
(LES) with a flamelet/progress variable approach. Using 300 simultaneous LES
computations of each flame, the partial Lyapunov spectrum of the flow is
obtained, which provides a set of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and Lyapunov vectors
(LVs). Special numerical procedures to handle such large data sets and perform
matrix manipulations on-the-fly are discussed. From the LEs, the dimension of
the attractor for the flames was estimated, for the first time, to be at least
5000 (flame D) and 10500 (flame E). This is a significant result indicating
that the chaoticity of the turbulent flame is confined to a volume of
phase-space that is quantified. The growth of perturbations occurs at
time-scales that are much larger than the smallest strain-rate based times
scales, but smaller than the integral scales. Further, the Lya- punov vectors
that determine the perturbation response show that the strongest perturbations
are aligned with the jet breakdown region, while other LVs are aligned with the
shear layer. It is found that both the extinction/re-ignition process and the
turbulence-induced jet motion strongly contribute to the flame chaoticity but
are not equally important for all the LVs. These results provide new insights
into the perturbation response of turbulent flames. More broadly, this Lyapunov
approach allows a full characterization of the chaotic dynamics associated with
turbulent flames, which have applications for both modeling and control of such
complex flows.

aspects of our lives. But, how do we know if these algorithms are biased and
commit unfair discrimination of a particular group of people, typically a
minority? \textit{Fairness} is generally studied in a probabilistic framework
where it is assumed that there exists a protected variable, whose use as an
input of the algorithm may imply discrimination. There are different
definitions of Fairness in the literature. In this paper we focus on two of
them which are called Disparate Impact (DI) and Balanced Error Rate (BER). Both
are based on the outcome of the algorithm across the different groups
determined by the protected variable. The relationship between these two
notions is also studied. The goals of this paper are to detect when a binary
classification rule lacks fairness and to try to fight against the potential
discrimination attributable to it. This can be done by modifying either the
classifiers or the data itself. Our work falls into the second category and
modifies the input data using optimal transport theory.

Hermitian matrices based on modified Cholesky decompositions is presented. In
contrast to existing algorithms, this algorithm allows to specify bounds on the
diagonal values of the approximation. It has no significant runtime and memory
overhead compared to the computation of a classical Cholesky decomposition.
Hence it is suitable for large matrices as well as sparse matrices since it
preserves the sparsity pattern of the original matrix. The algorithm tries to
minimize the approximation error in the Frobenius norm as well as the condition
number of the approximation. Since these two objectives often contradict each
other, it is possible to weight these two objectives by parameters of the
algorithm. In numerical experiments, the algorithm outperforms existing
algorithms regarding these two objectives. A Cholesky decomposition of the
approximation is calculated as a byproduct. This is useful, for example, if a
corresponding linear equation should be solved. A fully documented and
extensively tested implementation is available. Numerical optimization and
statistics are two fields of application in which the algorithm can be of

corrections based on a prior knowledge of contamination and incompleteness can
reduce the scatter to the level of shot noise expected for poorly sampled
clusters. We establish an empirical model quantifying the effect of imperfect
membership on cluster mass estimation and discuss its universal and
method-dependent features. We find that both imperfect membership and the
response of the mass estimators depend on cluster mass, effectively causing a
flattening of the estimated - true mass relation. Imperfect membership thus
alters cluster counts determined from spectroscopic surveys, hence the
cosmological parameters that depend on such counts.

of a void is a balance between the line tension cost versus the increased area
gain. Using the concepts of classical nucleation theory, we show that the
critical radius of a void formed in amorphous graphene at constant pressure is
simply the ratio of line tension at the void and the applied pressure. The
values of the critical radius of the void for flat and buckled graphene are
3.48\AA ~and 3.31\AA, respectively at 2 eV/\AA${^2}$ pressure. We also show
that the dominant finite size correction to the line tension is inversely
proportional to the radius of the void in both flat and buckled cases. Contrary
to conventional wisdom, with the help of a simple analytical model we find that
the shear modulus sets the lower limit of the line tension in the samples. This
makes our study relevant for other two-dimensional amorphous materials such as
h-BN, phosphorene, borophene, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results

target area runaways can be detected only after this distance, which in turn,
leads to a loss in well productivity and the risk of the need for an expensive
re-boring operation.
  We present a novel approach for identifying rock type at the drilling bit
based on machine learning classification methods and data mining on sensors

features coming from mathematical modeling of drilling mechanics, and show that
the real-time rock type classification error can be reduced from 13.5 % to 9 %.
The approach is applicable for precise directional drilling in relatively thin
target intervals of complex shapes and generalizes appropriately to new wells
that are different from the ones used for training the machine learning model.

Vehicle Routing Problem, can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization
problem, where time window assignments constitute first-stage decisions,
vehicle routes adhering to the assigned time windows constitute second-stage
decisions, and the objective is to minimize the expected routing costs. We
prove that a sampled deterministic equivalent of this stochastic model can be
reduced to a variant of the Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem, and we leverage
this result to develop a new scenario decomposition algorithm to solve it. From
a modeling viewpoint, our approach can accommodate both continuous and discrete
sets of feasible time window assignments as well as general scenario-based
models of uncertainty for several routing-specific parameters, including
customer demands and travel times, among others. From an algorithmic viewpoint,
our approach can be easily parallelized, can utilize any available vehicle

large-scale instances. We perform a comprehensive computational study to
demonstrate that our algorithm strongly outperforms all existing solution

explore gate-induced superconductivity in MoS$_2$ by performing tunneling
spectroscopy to determine the energy-dependent density of states (DOS) for

which is maximum (\Delta ~ 2 meV) for $\textit{n}$ of ~ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
decreases monotonously for larger $\textit{n}$. A perpendicular magnetic field

suppression of superconducting origin unexpectedly persists much above the

challenging task since concessions are not always part of an argument. Drawing
from a theoretically-informed typology of concessions, we conduct an annotation
task to label a set of polysemous lexical markers as introducing an
argumentative concession or not and we observe their distribution in threads
that achieved and did not achieve persuasion. For the annotation, we used both
expert and novice annotators. With the ultimate goal of conducting the study on
large datasets, we present a self-training method to automatically identify
argumentative concessions using linguistically motivated features. We achieve a
moderate F1 of 57.4% on the development set and 46.0% on the test set via the
self-training method. These results are comparable to state of the art results

bounded by the probability that these vertices are connected in a bond

approaches build on Bayesian updating in terms of probability measures or their
densities. However, the uncertainty propagation problems and their
discretisation within the stochastic Galerkin or collocation method are
naturally formulated for random vectors which calls for updating of random
variables, i.e. a filter. Such filters typically build on some approximation to
conditional expectation (CE). Specifically, the approximation of the CE with
affine functions leads to the familiar Kalman filter which works best on linear
or close to linear problems only. Our approach builds on a reformulation, which
allows to localise the operator of the CE to the point of measured value. The
resulting conditioned expectation (CdE) predicts correctly the quantities of
interest, e.g. conditioned mean and covariance, even for general highly
non-linear problems. The novel CdE allows straight-forward numerical
integration; particularly, the approximated covariance matrix is always
positive definite for integration rules with positive weights. The theoretical

note a total of 272 flares with mean FWHM of the flare $\backsim$21 s. The rms

observed the pulse profiles of the lightcurves do not change its shape implying
that there is no change in the geometry of accretion disk due to burst. The
hardness ratio and the rms variability of lightcurves show no correlation with
the flares. The flare-fraction shows a positive correlation with the
peak-to-peak ratio of the primary and secondary peaks of the pulse profile. The
observed hardening or the softening of the spectrum cannot be correlated with

  Retrieval of Soil Moisture and Vegetation Water Content in L-band",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Remote sensing of soil moisture and vegetation water content from space often
requires underdetermined inversion of a zeroth-order approximation of the
forward radiative transfer equation in L-band---known as the $\tau$-$\omega$
model. This paper shows that the least-squares (LS) inversion of the model is
not strictly convex due to its saddle point structure. It is demonstrated that
the widely used unconstrained damped least-squares (DLS) inversion of the model
could lead to biased and physically unrealistic retrievals---chiefly because of
the existing preferential solution spaces that are characterized by the
eigenspace of the model Hessian. In particular, the numerical experiments show
that for sparse (dense) vegetation with a shallow (deep) optical depth, the DLS
tends to overestimate (underestimate) the soil moisture and vegetation water
content for a dry (wet) soil. This paper proposes a new Constrained
Multi-Channel Algorithm (CMCA) that confines the retrievals by an a priori
information of the soil type and vegetation density. Unlike the existing
algorithms, the presented approach can account for slowly varying dynamics of
the vegetation water content over croplands through a temporal smoothing-norm
regularization. We also demonstrate that depending on the resolution of the
constraints, the algorithm leads to super-resolved soil moisture retrievals
with much higher resolution than the spatial resolution of the radiometric
observations.

gravitational system such as black hole must be generalized to the non-additive
entropy, which is given by $S_h=\gamma A^{\beta}$, where $A$ is the horizon
area and $\beta$ is the nonextensive parameter \cite{Tsa}. In this paper, by
taking the entropy associated with the apparent horizon of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe in the form of Tsallis entropy, and
assuming the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$, holds on the
apparent horizon, we are able to derive the corresponding Friedmann equations
describing the dynamics of the universe with any spatial curvature. We also
examine the time evolution of the total entropy and show that the generalized
second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled in a region enclosed by the apparent
horizon. Then, modifying the emergence proposal of gravity proposed by
Padmanabhan and calculating the difference between the surface degrees of
freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom in a region of space, we again arrive
at the modified Friedmann equation of the FRW Universe with any spatial
curvature which is the same as one obtained from the first law of
thermodynamics. We also study the cosmological consequences of Tsallis
cosmology. Interestingly enough, we find that this model can explain
simultaneously the late time acceleration in the universe filled with
pressureless matter without invoking dark energy, as well as the early
deceleration. Besides, the age problem can be circumvented automatically for an
accelerated universe and is estimated larger than $3/2$ age of the universe in
standard cosmology. For $\beta=2/5$, we find $13.12$ Gyr $< t_0 < 16.32 $ Gyr,

a concurrency analysis which shows that the improvement in concurrency is of

statistical approach for estimating the values of one or more unknown
parameters of a probabilistic model based on observed data. In this tutorial, I
briefly review the mathematical foundations of MLE, then reformulate the
problem for the measurement of a spatially-varying optical intensity
distribution. In this context, the detection of each individual photon is
treated as a random event, the outcome being the photon's location. A typical
measurement consists of many detected photons, which accumulate to form a
spatial intensity profile. Here, I show a straightforward derivation for the
likelihood function and Fisher information matrix (FIM) associated with a
measurement of multiple photons incident on a detector comprised of a discrete
array of pixels. An estimate for the parameter(s) of interest may then be
obtained by maximizing the likelihood function, while the FIM determines the
uncertainty of the estimate. To illustrate these concepts, several simple
examples are presented for the one- and two-parameter cases, revealing many
interesting properties of the MLE formalism, as well as some practical
considerations for optical experiments. Throughout these examples, connections
are also drawn to optical applications of quantum weak measurements, including
off-null ellipsometry and scatterometry.

a sentiment analysis model trained on a language be reused for sentiment

data is more limited? Our goal is to build a single model in the language with
the largest dataset available for the task, and reuse it for languages that

applications involving local compressive fiber buckling, a new family of
hyperelastic potentials is introduced. This family allows us to account for the
variable critical compressive stress, which depends on the fiber-matrix
interaction. For the simulation of viscoelasticity, the well-established
Sidoroff decomposition of the deformation gradient is implemented. To account
for the viscosity of the matrix material, the model of Simo and Miehe (1992) is
used; highly efficient iteration-free algorithms are implemented. The viscosity
of the fiber is likewise described by the multiplicative decomposition of the
deformation gradient, leading to a scalar differential equation; an efficient
iteration-free algorithm is proposed for the implicit time stepping. The
accuracy and convergence of the new iteration-free method is tested and
compared to that of the standard scheme implementing the Newton iteration. To
demonstrate the applicability of the approach, a pressurized multi-layer
composite pipe is modelled; the so-called stretch inversion phenomenon is
reproduced and explained. The stress distribution is obtained by a
semi-analytical procedure; it may serve as a benchmark for FEM computations.

algorithms for process discovery has raised the question of which algorithms
perform best on a given event log. Current evaluation frameworks for
empirically evaluating discovery techniques depend on the notation used
(behavioral identical models may give different results) and cannot provide
more general statements about populations of models. Therefore, this paper
proposes a new integrated evaluation framework that uses a classification
approach to make it modeling notation independent. Furthermore, it is founded
on experimental design to ensure the generalization of results. It supports two
main evaluation objectives: benchmarking process discovery algorithms and
sensitivity analysis, i.e. studying the effect of model and log characteristics
on a discovery algorithm's accuracy. The framework is designed as a scientific
workflow which enables automated, extendable and shareable evaluation
experiments. An extensive experiment including four discovery algorithms and
six control-flow characteristics validates the relevance and flexibility of the
framework. Ultimately, the paper aims to advance the state-of-the-art for
evaluating process discovery techniques.

optimal values of four geometric parameters and the bandgaps of three i-layers
were found for an amorphous-silicon, multi-terminal, thin-film tandem solar
cell comprising three p-i-n junctions with a metallic hexagonally corrugated

the figure of merit to be maximized, only the bandgap of the topmost i-layer
was significant and the remaining six parameters played minor roles. While this
configuration would absorb light very well, it would have poor electrical
