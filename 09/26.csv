variables. First, it extends Moran-Chatterji characterization and generalizes
Rao-Rubin characterization of Poisson distribution to COM-Poisson distribution.
Then, it defines the COM-type discrete r.v. ${X_\nu }$ of the discrete random
variable $X$. The probability mass function of ${X_\nu }$ has a link to the
R\'enyi entropy and Tsallis entropy of order $\nu $ of $X$. And then we can get
the characterization of Stam inequality for COM-type discrete version Fisher
information. By using the recurrence formula, the property that COM-Poisson
random variables ($\nu \ne 1$) is not closed under addition are obtained.
Finally, under the property of ""not closed under addition"" of COM-Poisson
random variables, a new characterization of Poisson distribution is found.

simple iterative methods such as gradient descent have been remarkably
successful in practice. The theoretical footings, however, had been largely
lacking until recently.
  In this tutorial-style overview, we highlight the important role of
statistical models in enabling efficient nonconvex optimization with
performance guarantees. We review two contrasting approaches: (1) two-stage
algorithms, which consist of a tailored initialization step followed by
successive refinement; and (2) global landscape analysis and
initialization-free algorithms. Several canonical matrix factorization problems
are discussed, including but not limited to matrix sensing, phase retrieval,
matrix completion, blind deconvolution, robust principal component analysis,
phase synchronization, and joint alignment. Special care is taken to illustrate
the key technical insights underlying their analyses. This article serves as a
testament that the integrated consideration of optimization and statistics
leads to fruitful research findings.

observes some context $c$, chooses some action $i$ to perform, and receives
some reward $r_{i,t}(c)$. We consider the variant of this problem where in
addition to receiving the reward $r_{i,t}(c)$, the learner also learns the
values of $r_{i,t}(c')$ for some other contexts $c'$ in set $\mathcal{O}_i(c)$;
i.e., the rewards that would have been achieved by performing that action under
different contexts $c'\in \mathcal{O}_i(c)$. This variant arises in several
strategic settings, such as learning how to bid in non-truthful repeated
auctions, which has gained a lot of attention lately as many platforms have
switched to running first-price auctions. We call this problem the contextual
bandits problem with cross-learning. The best algorithms for the classical
contextual bandits problem achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{CKT})$ regret against all
stationary policies, where $C$ is the number of contexts, $K$ the number of
actions, and $T$ the number of rounds. We design and analyze new algorithms for
the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning and show that their regret
has better dependence on the number of contexts. Under complete cross-learning
where the rewards for all contexts are learned when choosing an action, i.e.,
set $\mathcal{O}_i(c)$ contains all contexts, we show that our algorithms
achieve regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$, removing the dependence on $C$. For any
other cases, i.e., under partial cross-learning where $|\mathcal{O}_i(c)|< C$
for some context-action pair of $(i,c)$, the regret bounds depend on how the
sets $\mathcal O_i(c)$ impact the degree to which cross-learning between
contexts is possible. We simulate our algorithms on real auction data from an
ad exchange running first-price auctions and show that they outperform
traditional contextual bandit algorithms.

complex half-plane of the variable w into the area filled with fluid is
performed. We study the dynamics of singularities of both z(w,t) and the
complex fluid potential Pi(w,t) in the upper complex half-plane of w. We show
the existence of solutions with an arbitrary finite number N of complex poles
in z_w(w,t) and Pi_w(w,t) which are the derivatives of z(w,t) and Pi(w,t) over
w. The orders of poles can be arbitrary for zero surface tension while all
orders are even for nonzero surface tension. We find that the residues of
z_w(w,t) at these N points are new, previously unknown constants of motion, see
also Ref. V.E. Zakharov and A. I. Dyachenko, arXiv:1206.2046 (2012) for the
preliminary results. All these constants of motion commute with each other in
the sense of underlying Hamiltonian dynamics. In absence of both gravity and
surface tension, the residues of Pi_w(w,t) are also the constants of motion
while nonzero gravity g ensures a trivial linear dependence of these residues
on time. A Laurent series expansion of both z_w(w,t) and Pi_w(w,t) at each
poles position reveals an existence of additional integrals of motion for poles
of the second order. If all poles are simple then the number of independent
real integrals of motion is 4N for zero gravity and 4N-1 for nonzero gravity.
For the second order poles we found 6N motion integral for zero gravity and
6N-1 for nonzero gravity. We suggest that the existence of these nontrivial
constants of motion provides an argument in support of the conjecture of
complete integrability of free surface hydrodynamics in deep water.

characteristic crossover behaviour from anomalous to normal diffusion which is
otherwise fitted by two independent power-laws. A prominent example for a
subdiffusive-diffusive crossover are viscoelastic systems such as lipid bilayer
membranes, while superdiffusive-diffusive crossovers occur in systems of
actively moving biological cells. We here consider the general dynamics of a
stochastic particle driven by so-called tempered fractional Gaussian noise,
that is noise with Gaussian amplitude and power-law correlations, which are cut
off at some mesoscopic time scale. Concretely we consider such noise with
built-in exponential or power-law tempering, driving an overdamped Langevin
equation (fractional Brownian motion) and fractional Langevin equation motion.
We derive explicit expressions for the mean squared displacement and
correlation functions, including different shapes of the crossover behaviour
depending on the concrete tempering, and discuss the physical meaning of the
tempering. In the case of power-law tempering we also find a crossover
behaviour from faster to slower superdiffusion and slower to faster
subdiffusion. As a direct application of our model we demonstrate that the
obtained dynamics quantitatively described the subdiffusion-diffusion and
subdiffusion-subdiffusion crossover in lipid bilayer systems. We also show that
a model of tempered fractional Brownian motion recently proposed by Sabzikar
and Meerschaert leads to physically very different behaviour with a seemingly
paradoxical ballistic long time scaling.

resonant vorticity mixing, which conserves potential enstrophy, enables ZF
saturation in the absence of drag, and so is effective in the Dimits up-shift
regime. Vorticity mixing is incorporated as a nonlinear, self-regulation effect
in an extended 0D predator--prey model of drift--ZF turbulence. This analysis
determines the saturated ZF shear and shows that the mesoscopic ZF width scales
as $L_{ZF}\sim f^{3/16} (1-f)^{1/8} \rho_s^{5/8} l_0^{3/8}$ in the relevant
adiabatic limit (i.e., $\tau_{ck} k_\|^2 D_\| \gg 1$). $f$ is the fraction of
turbulence energy coupled to ZF and $l_0$ is the mixing length absent ZF
shears. We calculate and compare the stationary flow and turbulence level in
frictionless, weakly frictional, and strongly frictional regimes. In the
frictionless limit, the results differ significantly from conventionally quoted
scalings derived for frictional regimes. The flow is independent of turbulence
intensity. The turbulence level scales as $E \sim (\gamma_L/\varepsilon_c)^2$,
which defines the extent of the ""near-marginal"" regime to be $\gamma_L <
\varepsilon_c$, for the case of avalanche-induced profile variability. Here,
$\varepsilon_c$ is the rate of dissipation of potential enstrophy and
$\gamma_L$ is the characteristic linear growth rate of fluctuations. The
implications for dynamics near marginality of the strong scaling of saturated
$E$ with $\gamma_L$ are discussed.

of simulating quantum channels under free quantum operations that completely
preserve positivity of the partial transpose (PPT). First, we introduce the
$\kappa$-entanglement measure for point-to-point quantum channels, based on the
idea of the $\kappa$-entanglement of bipartite states, and we establish several
fundamental properties for it, including amortization collapse, monotonicity
under PPT superchannels, additivity, normalization, faithfulness, and
non-convexity. Second, we introduce and solve the exact entanglement cost for
simulating quantum channels in both the parallel and sequential settings, along
with the assistance of free PPT-preserving operations. In particular, we
establish that the entanglement cost in both cases is given by the same
single-letter formula, the $\kappa$-entanglement measure of a quantum channel.
We further show that this cost is equal to the largest $\kappa$-entanglement
that can be shared or generated by the sender and receiver of the channel. This
formula is calculable by a semidefinite program, thus allowing for an
efficiently computable solution for general quantum channels. Noting that the
sequential regime is more powerful than the parallel regime, another notable
implication of our result is that both regimes have the same power for exact
quantum channel simulation, when PPT superchannels are free. For several basic
Gaussian quantum channels, we show that the exact entanglement cost is given by
the Holevo--Werner formula [Holevo and Werner, Phys. Rev. A 63, 032312 (2001)],
giving an operational meaning of the Holevo-Werner quantity for these channels.

result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology

spinel FeAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$ transforms to a tetragonal phase at ~18 GPa. This
tetragonal phase has a highly irregular unit-cell volume versus pressure
dependence up to ~45 GPa, after which a transformation to a Cmcm post-spinel
phase is onset. This is attributable to pressure driven Fe-Al site inversion at
room temperature, corroborated by signatures in the 57Fe M\""ossbauer
spectroscopy pressure data. At the tetragonal to post-spinel transition, onset
in the range 45-50 GPa, there is a concurrent emergence of a non-magnetic
spectral component in the M\""ossbauer data at variable cryogenic temperatures.
This is interpreted as spin crossover at sixfold coordinated Fe locations
emanated from site inversion. Spin crossover commences at the end of the
pressure range of the tetragonal phase and progresses in the post-spinel
structure. There is also a much steeper volume change dV/V ~ 10% in the range
45-50 GPa compared to the preceding pressure regime, from the combined effects
of the structural transition and spin crossover electronic change. At the
highest pressure attained, ~106 GPa, the M\""ossbauer data evidences a
diamagnetic Fe low-spin abundance of ~50%. The rest of the high-spin Fe in
eightfold coordinated sites continue to experience a relatively small internal
magnetic field of ~33 T. This is indicative of a magnetic ground state
associated with strong covalency, as well as substantive disorder from site
inversion and the mixed spin-state configuration. Intriguingly magnetism
survives in such a spin-diluted post-spinel lattice at high densities. The
R(300 K) data decreases by only two orders of magnitude from ambient pressure
to the vicinity of ~100 GPa. Despite a ~26% unit-cell volume densification from

of the cuprates early on, and while widely different proposals exist for its
microscopic origin, little is known empirically on the microscopic scale. Here,
we elucidate the properties of the insulating layers with a newly developed
scanning noise spectroscopy technique that can spatially map not only the
current but also the current fluctuations in time. We discover atomic-scale
noise centers that exhibit MHz current fluctuations 40 times the expectation
from Poissonian noise, more than what has been observed in mesoscopic systems.
Such behaviour can only happen in highly polarizable insulators and represents
strong evidence for trapping of charge in the charge reservoir layers. Our

evaluation-functions evaluated over the minimum t-norm and establish strong
completeness theorems for various fuzzy analogies of prominent extensions for

functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations with hybrid exchange-correlation
functionals. For large basis set, the computational bottleneck for large scale
calculations is the application of the Fock exchange operator to the
time-dependent orbitals. Our main goal is to reduce the frequency of applying
the Fock exchange operator, without loss of accuracy. We achieve this by
combining the recently developed parallel transport (PT) gauge formalism and
the adaptively compressed exchange operator (ACE) formalism. The PT gauge
yields the slowest possible dynamics among all choices of gauge. When coupled
with implicit time integrators such as the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme, the
resulting PT-CN scheme can significantly increase the time step from
sub-attoseconds to 10-100 attoseconds. At each time step $t_{n}$, PT-CN
requires the self-consistent solution of the orbitals at time $t_{n+1}$. We use
ACE to delay the update of the Fock exchange operator in this nonlinear system,
while maintaining the same self-consistent solution. We verify the performance
of the resulting PT-CN-ACE method by computing the absorption spectrum of a
benzene molecule and the response of bulk silicon systems to an ultrafast laser
pulse, using the planewave basis set and the HSE functional. We report the
strong and weak scaling of the PT-CN-ACE method for silicon systems ranging
from 32 to 1024 atoms, with up to 2048 computational cores. Compared to
standard explicit time integrators such as the 4th order Runge-Kutta method
(RK4), the PT-CN-ACE can reduce the Fock exchange operator application by
nearly 70 times, thus reduce the overall wall clock time time by 46 times for
the system with 1024 atoms. Hence our work enables hybrid functional rt-TDDFT
calculations to be routinely performed with a large basis set for the first
time.

atmospheric models in chemical equilibrium, using the latest version of
petitCODE. Our study covers a broad range of parameter space: 400
K$<$T$_{eff}<$2600 K, 2.0$<$log(g)$<$5.0, -1.0$<$[Fe/H]$<$2.0,
0.25$<$C/O$<$1.25, and stellar types from M to F. We make the synthetic
transmission and emission spectra, as well as the temperature structures
publicly available. We find that the transition C/O ratio depends on many
parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and
spectral type of the host star, and could have values less, equal, or higher
than unity. By mapping all the transition C/O ratios we propose a ""four-class""
classification scheme for irradiated planets in this temperature range. We find
a parameter space where methane always remains the cause of dominant spectral
features. CH$_4$ detection in this region, or the lack of it, provides a
diagnostic tool to identify the prevalence of cloud formation and
non-equilibrium chemistry. As another diagnostic tool, we construct synthetic
Spitzer IRAC color-diagrams showing two distinguishable populations of planets.
Since most of the exoplanet atmospheres appear cloudy when studied in
transmission, we regard this study as a starting point of how such a

This preparatory work will have to be refined by future cloudy and
non-equilibrium modeling, to further investigate the existence and exact

the peak of the dust continuum, are similar to those of local ULIRGs,
suggesting an intense starburst in this source. This is consistent with the
high intrinsic FIR luminosity (~ 3 x 10^12 Lo), ~ 16 Myr gas depletion
timescale, and < 8 Myr timescale since the last starburst episode, estimated
from the hardness of the UV radiation field. By applying gravitational lensing
models to the visibilities in the uv-plane, we find that the lensing
magnification factor varies by a factor of two across SDP.11, affecting the
observed line profiles. After correcting for the effects of differential
lensing, a symmetric line profile is recovered, suggesting that the starburst

relevant degrees of freedom of a system by maximizing an information-theoretic

methods. Motivated by this, we investigate the information theoretic properties
of coarse-graining procedures, for both translationally invariant and
disordered systems. We prove that a perfect RSMI coarse-graining does not
increase the range of interactions in the renormalized Hamiltonian, and, for
disordered systems, suppresses generation of correlations in the renormalized
disorder distribution, being in this sense optimal. We empirically verify decay
of those measures of complexity, as a function of information retained by the
RG, on the examples of arbitrary coarse-grainings of the clean and random Ising
chain. The results establish a direct and quantifiable connection between
properties of RG viewed as a compression scheme, and those of physical objects
i.e. Hamiltonians and disorder distributions. We also study the effect of
constraints on the number and type of coarse-grained degrees of freedom on a

initiated a large MMT spectroscopic survey identifying rest-frame optical
emission lines in 227 intense [OIII] emitting galaxies at $1.3<z<2.4$. This
sample complements the MOSDEF and KBSS surveys, extending to much lower stellar

recent upturn in star formation. The hydrogen ionizing production efficiency
($\xi_{\rm{ion}}$) is found to increase with the [OIII] EW, in a manner similar
to that found in local galaxies by Chevallard et al. (2018). We describe how

Ly$\alpha$ emission in $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies with strong [OIII]+H$\beta$

older and more massive galaxies. In the most intense line emitters, the indices
have very large average values (O32 $=9.1$, Ne3O2 $=0.5$) that have been shown

cold stellar streams in the Milky Way halo lead to density perturbations in the
latter, making streams an effective probe for detecting dark matter
substructure. The Pal 5 stream is one such system for which we have some of the
best data. However, Pal 5 orbits close to the center of the Milky Way and has
passed through the Galactic disk many times, where its structure can be
perturbed by baryonic structures such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular
clouds (GMCs). In order to understand how these baryonic structures affect Pal
5's density, we present a detailed study of the effects of the Galactic bar,
spiral structure, GMCs, and globular clusters on the Pal 5 stream. We estimate
the effect of each perturber on the stream density by computing its power
spectrum and comparing it to the power induced by a CDM-like population of dark
matter subhalos. We find that the bar and GMCs can each individually create
power that is comparable to the observed power on large scales, leaving little
room for dark matter substructure, while spirals are subdominant on all scales.
On degree scales, the power induced by the bar is small, but GMCs create
small-scale density variations that are similar in amplitude to the dark-matter
induced variations but otherwise indistinguishable from it. These results
demonstrate that Pal 5 is a poor system for constraining the dark matter
substructure fraction and that observing streams further out in the halo will
be necessary to confidently detect dark matter subhalos.

multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the
Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very
controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the first
open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did
not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick
disk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the
remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances
derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at
Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean
[Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no
indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not
find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in
Geisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the
presence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very
high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence
for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE
data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the
Galactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is
unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent
hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge and
radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation
for this intriguing object.

relativistic temperature corrections to the tSZ signal on the power spectrum
analysis of the Planck Compton-$y$ map, developing a novel formalism to account
for the associated effects. The amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum is found to
be sensitive to the effective electron temperature, $\bar{T}_e$, of the cluster
sample. Omitting the corresponding modifications leads to an underestimation of
the $yy$-power spectrum amplitude. Relativistic corrections thus add to the
error budget of tSZ power spectrum observables such as $\sigma_8$. This could
help alleviate the tension between various cosmological probes, with the
correction scaling as $\Delta \sigma_8/\sigma_8 \simeq
0.019\,[k\bar{T}_e\,/\,5\,{\rm keV}]$ for Planck. At the current level of
precision, this implies a systematic shift by $\simeq 1\sigma$, which can also
be interpreted as an overestimation of the hydrostatic mass bias by $\Delta b
\simeq 0.046\,(1-b)\,[k\bar{T}_e\,/\,5\,{\rm keV}]$, bringing it into better
agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. It is thus time to consider

The generic prediction of these theories is the existence of additional

In this paper we analyze the collider signatures for some simple concrete
realizations of this framework. We find that despite the existence of
additional weakly and strongly coupled particles that are kinematically within

perform single-document extractive summarization without
heuristically-generated extractive labels. We call our approach BanditSum as it
treats extractive summarization as a contextual bandit (CB) problem, where the
model receives a document to summarize (the context), and chooses a sequence of
sentences to include in the summary (the action). A policy gradient
reinforcement learning algorithm is used to train the model to select sequences
of sentences that maximize ROUGE score. We perform a series of experiments
demonstrating that BanditSum is able to achieve ROUGE scores that are better
than or comparable to the state-of-the-art for extractive summarization, and
converges using significantly fewer update steps than competing approaches. In
addition, we show empirically that BanditSum performs significantly better than
competing approaches when good summary sentences appear late in the source
document.

circuits which only use a single ancilla qubit, requiring classical
post-processing to extract eigenvalue details of the system. We investigate
choices for phase estimation for a unitary matrix with low-depth noise-free or
noisy circuits, varying both the phase estimation circuits themselves as well
as the classical post-processing to determine the eigenvalue phases. We work in
the scenario when the input state is not an eigenstate of the unitary matrix.
We develop a new post-processing technique to extract eigenvalues from phase
estimation data based on a classical time-series (or frequency) analysis and
contrast this to an analysis via Bayesian methods. We calculate the variance in
estimating single eigenvalues via the time-series analysis analytically,
finding that it scales to first order in the number of experiments performed,

control for computation of ""funnels"" of states around trajectories, and (3)
repeating (1) and (2) in a way that the funnels are grown backward from the

recent years, especially the large dark formations which are thought to
represent waves in the prograde jet on the NEB south edge (NEBs, 7N), and the
NEB expansion events (NEEs) in which the belt broadens to the north at
intervals of 3 to 5 years. Here I describe an exceptional set of apparently
coordinated changes which occurred in 2011-12, after more localised precursors
in 2008 and 2010. (1) The large NEBs dark formations progressively disappeared
until none remained. (2) In the sectors of NEBs thus vacated, smaller dark
features all moved with unprecedented super-fast speeds, which were modulated
by the few normal features as long as they lasted, and then accelerated
further, reaching 139-151 m/s. (3) Rifts (expanding systems of convective white
clouds) also disappeared from the NEB. (4) The NEB north half progressively
faded (whitened) until there was only a narrow, southerly NEB, narrower and
fainter than it had been for nearly a century. These changes have several
profound implications for understanding the dynamics of the region. First, the
NEBs took on the same appearance, dynamics, and speed, as the equivalent jet at
7S (SEBn), supporting the view that the two jets are essentially symmetrical,
with an underlying jet in the range 150-170 m/s. Secondly, the manifestation of
this jet at the surface is normally suppressed by the presence of large
slow-moving formations, which are probably Rossby waves. Thirdly, the loss of
the large dark formations and the narrowing of the belt may have been promoted
by the decline of convective rift activity. Fourthly, these changes seem to
represent a reversion to the situation that existed before 1912, when such
appearances were common and were followed cyclically by vigorous NEB Revivals.
Indeed, just such a Revival would ensue in 2012.

explained by a superposition of an inverted-spectrum source with a synchrotron
component containing a disordered magnetic field. The UV-optical and X-ray
light curves include dips and flares, while several superluminal knots appear
in the parsec-scale jet. The recovery time of the second dip was longer at
UV-optical wavelengths, in conflict with a model in which the inner accretion
disk (AD) is disrupted during a dip and then refilled from outer to inner
radii. We favor an alternative scenario in which occasional polar alignments of
the magnetic field in the disk and corona cause the flux dips and formation of
shocks in the jet. Similar to observations of Seyfert galaxies, intra-band time
lags of flux variations are longer than predicted by the standard AD model.
This suggests that scattering or some other reprocessing occurs. The 37 GHz
light curve is well correlated with the optical-UV variations, with a ~20-day
delay. A radio flare in the jet occurred in a superluminal knot 0.14
milliarcseconds downstream of the 43 GHz ""core,"" which places the site of the
preceding X-ray/UV/optical flare within the core 0.5-1.3 pc from the black

inferred in the TeV gamma-ray emitting regions of some BL Lacertae objects.

fundamental challenge for any effort to probe the evolution of neutral hydrogen
during the Cosmic Dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR) using the 21 cm
hyperfine transition. Foreground separation is made possible by their intrinsic
spectral smoothness, making them distinguishable from spectrally complex
cosmological signal even though they are ~5 orders of magnitude brighter.
Precisely calibrated radio interferometers are essential to maintaining the
smoothness and thus separability of the foregrounds. One powerful calibration
strategy is to use redundant measurements between pairs of antennas with the
same physical separation in order to solve for each antenna's spectral response
without reference to a sky model. This strategy is being employed by the
Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a large radio telescope in South
Africa that is now observing while being built out to 350 14-m dishes. However,
the deviations from perfect redundancy inherent in any real radio telescope
complicate the calibration problem. Using simulations of HERA, we show how
calibration with antenna-to-antenna variations in dish construction and
placement generally lead to spectral structure in otherwise smooth foregrounds
that significantly reduces the number of cosmological modes available to a 21
cm measurement. However, we also show that this effect can be largely
eliminated by a modified redundant-baseline calibration strategy that relies
predominantly on short baselines.

costly to implement. The small number of qubits available in existing quantum
computers adds another constraint on quantum circuits. As a result, reducing
T-count and qubit cost have become important optimization goals. The design of
quantum circuits for integer division has caught the attention of researchers
and designs have been proposed in the literature. However, these designs suffer
from excessive T gate and qubit costs. Many of these designs also produce
significant garbage output resulting in additional qubit and T gate costs to
eliminate these outputs. In this work, we propose two quantum integer division
circuits. The first proposed quantum integer division circuit is based on the
restoring division algorithm and the second proposed design implements the
non-restoring division algorithm. Both proposed designs are optimized in terms
of T-count, T-depth and qubits. Both proposed quantum circuit designs are based
on (i) a quantum subtractor, (ii) a quantum adder-subtractor circuit, and (iii)
a novel quantum conditional addition circuit. Our proposed restoring division

Here we show how universal quantum computation could be implemented
unconditionally using an integrated platform able to sustain both linear and
quadratic optomechanical-like interactions. Specifically, considering cavity
opto- and electro-mechanical systems, we propose a realisation of a
driven-dissipative dynamics that deterministically prepares the required
non-Gaussian cluster states -- entangled squeezed states of multiple mechanical
oscillators suitably interspersed with cubic-phase states. We next demonstrate
how arbitrary Gaussian measurements on the cluster nodes can be performed by
continuously monitoring the output cavity field. Finally, the feasibility
requirements of this approach are analysed in detail, suggesting that its
building blocks are within reach of current technology.

nonconvexities due to binary variables, in order to reduce the market
participants' opportunity costs, such as generators' unrecovered costs. The
opportunity cost is defined as the difference between the profit when the
instructions of the market operator are followed and when the market
participants can freely make their own decisions based on the market prices. We
use the minimum complementarity approximation to the minimum total opportunity
cost (MTOC) model, from previous research, with tests on a much more realistic
unit commitment (UC) model than in previous research, including features such
as reserve requirements, ramping constraints, and minimum up and down times.
The developed model incorporates flexible price responsive demand, as in
previous research, but since not all demand is price responsive, we consider
the more realistic case that total demand is a mixture of fixed and flexible.
Another improvement over previous MTOC research is computational: whereas the
previous research had nonconvex terms among the objective function's continuous
variables, we convert the objective to an equivalent form that contains only
linear and convex quadratic terms in the continuous variables. We compare the
unit commitment model with the standard social welfare optimization version of
UC, in a series of sensitivity analyses, varying flexible demand to represent
varying degrees of future penetration of electric vehicles and smart
appliances, different ratios of generation availability, and different values
of transmission line capacities to consider possible congestion. The minimum
total opportunity cost and social welfare solutions are mostly very close in
different scenarios, except in some extreme cases.

serendipitous discoveries. To cope with the larger datasets looming on the
horizon such as astronomy's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) or the 100's

design that is optimized for efficiency in task assignment and incorporating
human and machine classifiers into the classification engine. By making
efficient use of smart task assignment and the combination of human and machine
classifiers, we can achieve greater accuracy and flexibility than has been
possible to date. We note that creating the most efficient system must consider
how best to engage and retain volunteers as well as make the most efficient use
of their classifications. Our work thus focuses on understanding the factors
that optimize efficiency of the combined human-machine system. This paper
summarizes some of our research to date on integration of machine learning with

In order to theoretically model search channels involving many additional jets,
it is important to include tree-level matrix elements matched to a parton
shower algorithm, and a suitable matching procedure to remove the double
counting of additional radiation. There are then two potential problems: (i)
EFT corrections are absent in the shower, leading to an extra source of
discontinuities in the matching procedure; (ii) the uncertainty in the matching

observables sensitive to radiation. In this paper, we review why the first of

population located in front of the {$\sigma$} Orionis cluster. If this is the
case, then SO 411 is older and even more peculiar, since primordial disks in
this stellar mass range are scarce for ages $>$5 Myr. Analysis of the silicate
10$\mu$m feature of SO 411 indicates that the observed feature arises at the

dynamical oscillations in an open system where a designated probe qubit
interacts with an entangled dark state of an array of qubits which effectively
traps radiation as an atomic cavity. The qubit-cavity system is shown to
achieve a large cooperativity of $\mathcal{C}=172$ due to collective
enhancement of photon-mediated interactions, entering the strong coupling
regime. The quantum coherence of the dark state cavity is also explored through
its nonlinear response at the single-excitation level. With realistic
refinements, this system is suitable for studying the many-body dynamics of
large ($N>10$) quantum spin chains, synthesizing highly non-classical radiation
fields on demand, and implementing universal quantum logic operations with high
fidelity on information encoded within decoherence-free subspaces.

  The Minkowski problem asks to characterize Borel measures $\mu$ on $\sphere$

approximation argument. This approach is also applied to the case where $G$ is
decreasing and $\psi$ is increasing, and hence augments our previous work. When
the measures $\mu$ are even, solutions that are origin-symmetric convex bodies
are also provided under some mild conditions on $G$ and $\psi$. Our results
generalize several previous works and provide more precise information about

  In this paper, an algorithm to tracking vehicles able to move both on and off

An efficient and scalable approach to visual localization is to use image
retrieval techniques. These approaches identify the image most similar to a
query photo in a database of geo-tagged images and approximate the query's pose
via the pose of the retrieved database image. However, image retrieval across
drastically different illumination conditions, e.g. day and night, is still a
problem with unsatisfactory results, even in this age of powerful neural

little training data and, most importantly, without ground-truth pairings. In

decay of fissile nucleus by inclusion of important physical effects in the
model and through a systematic analysis of a large set of data over a wide
range of CN mass (ACN). The model includes shell effect in the level density
(LD) parameter, shell correction in the fission barrier, effect of the
orientation degree of freedom of the CN spin (Kor), collective enhancement of
level density (CELD) and dissipation in fission. Input parameters are not tuned
to reproduce observables from specific reaction(s) and the reduced dissipation
coefficient is treated as the only adjustable parameter. Calculated evaporation
residue (ER) cross sections, fission cross sections and particle, i.e. neutron,
proton and alpha-particle, multiplicities are compared with data covering ACN =
156-248. The model produces reasonable fits to ER and fission excitation
functions for all the reactions considered in this work. Pre-scission neutron
multiplicities are underestimated by the calculation beyond ACN~200. An
increasingly higher value of pre-saddle dissipation strength is required to
reproduce the data with increasing ACN. Proton and alpha-particle
multiplicities, measured in coincidence with both ERs and fission fragments,
are in qualitative agreement with model predictions. The present work mitigates
the existing inconsistencies in modelling statistical decay of the fissile CN
to a large extent.

condensate is not on the support of the Dirac spectrum. To understand this
behavior we decompose the spectral density and the chiral condensate into
contributions from the zero modes, the quenched part, and a remainder which is
sensitive to the fermion determinant and is referred to as the dynamical part.
We obtain general formulas for the contributions of the zero modes. Expressions
for the quenched part, valid for an arbitrary number of flavors, and for the
dynamical part, valid for one and two flavors, are derived in the microscopic
domain of QCD. We find that at nonzero $\theta$-angle the quenched and
dynamical part of the Dirac spectral density are strongly oscillating with an
amplitude that increases exponentially with the volume $V$ and a period of
order of $1/V$. The quenched part of the chiral condensate becomes
exponentially large at $\theta\ne0$, but this divergence is canceled by the
contribution from the zero modes. The oscillatory behavior of the dynamical
part of the density is essential for moving the discontinuity of the chiral
condensate away from the support of the Dirac spectrum. As important
by-products of this work we obtain analytical expressions for the microscopic
spectral density of the Dirac operator at nonzero $\theta$-angle for both one-

accurately estimating its position within a global map reference frame. This is
necessary for optimal path planning and safe navigation. To accomplish this
over an extended period of time, the global map requires long-term maintenance.
This includes the addition of newly observable features and the removal of
transient features belonging to dynamic objects. The latter is especially
important for the long-term use of the map as matching against a map with
features that no longer exist can result in incorrect data associations, and
consequently erroneous localisation. This paper addresses the problem of
removing features from the map that correspond to objects that are no longer
observable/present in the environment. This is achieved by assigning a single
score which depends on the geometric distribution and characteristics when the
features are re-detected (or not) on different occasions. Our approach not only
eliminates ephemeral features, but also can be used as a reduction algorithm
for highly dense maps. We tested our approach using half a year of weekly
drives over the same 500-metre section of road in an urban environment. The
results presented demonstrate the validity of the long-term approach to map

disk is irradiated by the disk. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations to study the winds driven by radiation force from the corona in the
innermost regions. The hard X-ray spectrum from active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
suggests that the corona temperature is about $10^9$ K, so that we mainly
analyze the properties of winds (or outflows) from the $10^9$ K corona. The
disk luminosity plays an important role in driving the outflows. The more
luminous the disk, the stronger the outflows. Mass outflow rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm
out}$) at a 90 Schwarschild radius depends on disk luminosity, which can be
described as $\dot{M}_{\rm out}\propto 10^{3.3 \Gamma}$ ($\Gamma$ is the ratio
of the disk luminosity to the Eddington luminosity). In the case of high
luminosity (e.g. $\Gamma=0.75$), the supersonic outflows with maximum speed
$1.0 \times 10^4$ Km s$^{-1}$ are launched at $\sim17^{o}$ --$30^{o}$ and
$\sim50^{o}$ --$80^{o}$ away from the pole axis. The Bernoulli parameter keeps
increasing with the outward propagation of outflows. The radiation force keeps
accelerating the outflows when outflows move outward. Therefore, we can expect
the outflows to escape from the BH gravity and go to the galactic scale. The
interaction between outflows and interstellar medium may be an important AGN
feedback process.

formed the encapsulating membranes of the first protocells. Carbon-rich
meteorites (i.e., carbonaceous chondrites) such as Murchison and Tagish Lake
are well known to contain these molecules, and their delivery to the early
planet by intense early meteorite bombardments constitutes a key prebiotic
source. We collect the fatty acid abundances measured in various carbonaceous
chondrites from the literature and analyze them for patterns and correlations.
Fatty acids in meteorites include straight-chain and branched-chain
monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids up to 12 carbons in length---fatty acids
with at least 8 carbons are required to form vesicles, and modern cell
membranes employ lipids with ~12--20 carbons. To understand the origin of
meteoritic fatty acids, we search the literature for abiotic fatty acid
reaction pathways and create a candidate list of 11 reactions that could
potentially produce these fatty acids in meteorite parent bodies.
Straight-chain monocarboxylic acids (SCMA) are the dominant fatty acids in
meteorites, followed by branched-chain monocarboxylic acids (BCMA). SCMA are
most abundant in CM2 and Tagish Lake (ungrouped) meteorites, ranging on average
from 10$^2$ ppb to 4x10$^5$ ppb, and 10$^4$ ppb to 5x10$^6$ ppb, respectively.
In CM, CV, and Tagish Lake meteorites, SCMA abundances generally decrease with
increasing carbon chain length. Conversely, SCMA abundances in CR meteorites
peak at 5 and 6 carbons in length, and decrease on either side of this peak.
This unique CR fatty acid distribution may hint at terrestrial contamination,
or that certain fatty acid reactions mechanisms are active in different
meteorite parent bodies (planetesimals). We identify Fischer-Tropsch-type
synthesis as the most promising pathway for further analysis in the production
of fatty acids in planetesimals.

existence of a crossed product construction is guaranteed by the existence of
""cross representations"". For one-parameter automorphism groups, we prove that
the existence of cross representations is stable with respect to a large set of

representations of inner actions on von Neumann algebras. For one-parameter
automorphism groups we study the cross property for covariant representations,
where the generator of the implementing unitary group is positive. In
particular, we find that if the Borchers-Arveson minimal implementing group is
cross, then so are all other implementing groups. For higher dimensional Lie
group actions, we consider a class of spectral conditions which include the
ones occurring in physics, and is sensible also for non-abelian or for infinite

nuclei, the three-body system composed of two protons and a single $K^-$ meson,
$K^-pp$, is the most essential. In this article, we will report on the recent
situation of $K^-pp$ studies in both theoretical and experimental sides.
Afterwards, we will explain our latest study of the $K^-pp$ with a fully
coupled-channel complex scaling method (Full ccCSM) using a chiral SU(3)-based
$\bar{K}N$(-$\pi Y$) potential. In Full ccCSM, the $K^-pp$ is completely
treated as a resonant state of a $\bar{K}NN$-$\pi\Sigma N$-$\pi\Lambda N$
coupled-channel system. The energy dependence involved in the chiral potential
is handled with a self-consistent calculation in which two extreme ansatzes are
examined: field picture and particle picture. With our chiral SU(3)-based
potential constrained by the precise data of kaonic hydrogen atom (SIDDHARTA
experiment), the $K^-pp$ resonance is obtained as a shallowly bound state
measured from the $\bar{K}NN$ threshold with a narrow width, if the field
picture is employed in the calculation: the binding energy is $14-28$ MeV and
half value of the mesonic decay width are $8-15$ MeV. On the other hand, if the
particle picture is employed, it is found that the binding energy could be as
large as about 50 MeV, even though such a chiral potential is used. Based on
these results of Full ccCSM calculation, we have discussed on the possibility
for kaonic nuclei to form a dense matter and on the latest experimental result

  Merging galaxies which include galaxies with lower masses show a higher

merging galaxies in this sample suggests that at galaxy nuclei separations of
3-15 kpc merging galaxies are still in a early stage and are yet to reach the
maximum level of star formation activity. Furthermore, the level of star
formation enhancement and its duration could be arguably reduced compared to
local mergers, as shown by simulations of high-z mergers, and might also depend
on the physical properties (such as stellar mass and gas fraction) of the

feasible and near-globally optimal solutions for unit commitment (UC) with AC
transmission constraints. First, we develop a second-order cone programming
(SOCP) relaxation for AC unit commitment. To ensure that the resulting
solutions are feasible for the original non-convex problem, we incorporate
penalty terms into the objective of the proposed SOCP relaxation. We generalize
our penalization method to a sequential algorithm which starts from an initial
point (not necessarily feasible) and leads to feasible and near-optimal
solutions for AC unit commitment. Once a feasible point is attained, the
algorithm preserves feasibility and improves the objective value until a near
optimal point is obtained. The experimental results on IEEE 57, IEEE 118, and
IEEE 300 bus benchmark cases from MATPOWER demonstrate the performance of the
proposed method in solving challenging instances of AC unit commitment.

single over can completely change the momentum of the game. With millions of
people following the Indian Premier League (IPL), developing a model for
predicting the outcome of its matches is a real-world problem. A cricket match
depends upon various factors, and in this work, the factors which significantly
influence the outcome of a Twenty20 cricket match are identified. Each player's
performance in the field is considered to find out the overall weight (relative
strength) of the teams. A multivariate regression based solution is proposed to
calculate points for each player in the league and the overall weight of a team
is computed based on the past performance of the players who have appeared most
for the team. Finally, a dataset is modeled based on the identified seven
factors which influence the outcome of an IPL match. Six machine learning
models were trained and used for predicting the outcome of each 2018 IPL match,
15 minutes before the gameplay, immediately after the toss. Three of the
trained models were seen to be correctly predicting more than 40 matches, with
Multilayer Perceptron outperforming all other models with an impressive
accuracy of 71.66%.

objective function subject to a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraint. In

optimization problems into polynomial-time solvable surrogates. As an
alternative to the state-of-the-art semidefinite programming (SDP) and
second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxations, a computationally efficient
parabolic relaxation is developed, which relies on convex quadratic constraints
only. Next, we developed a family of penalty functions, which can be
incorporated into the objective of SDP, SOCP, and parabolic relaxations to
facilitate the recovery of feasible points for the original non-convex BMI
optimization. Penalty terms can be constructed using any arbitrary initial
point. We prove that if the initial point is sufficiently close to the feasible
set, then the penalized relaxations are guaranteed to produce feasible points
for the original BMI. In Part II of the paper, the efficacy of the proposed
penalized convex relaxations is demonstrated on benchmark instances of H2 and

  December 2021",,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a Boolean function $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$, the Fourier distribution
assigns probability $\widehat{f}(S)^2$ to $S\subseteq [n]$. The Fourier
Entropy-Influence (FEI) conjecture of Friedgut and Kalai asks if there exist a
universal constant C>0 such that $H(\hat{f}^2)\leq C Inf(f)$, where
$H(\hat{f}^2)$ is the Shannon entropy of the Fourier distribution of $f$ and
$Inf(f)$ is the total influence of $f$.
  1) We consider the weaker Fourier Min-entropy-Influence (FMEI) conjecture.
This asks if $H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)\leq C Inf(f)$, where
$H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)$ is the min-entropy of the Fourier distribution. We show
$H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)\leq 2C_{\min}^\oplus(f)$, where $C_{\min}^\oplus(f)$ is
the minimum parity certificate complexity of $f$. We also show that for every
$\epsilon\geq 0$, we have $H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)\leq 2\log
(\|\hat{f}\|_{1,\epsilon}/(1-\epsilon))$, where $\|\hat{f}\|_{1,\epsilon}$ is
the approximate spectral norm of $f$. As a corollary, we verify the FMEI
conjecture for the class of read-$k$ $DNF$s (for constant $k$).
  2) We show that $H(\hat{f}^2)\leq 2 aUC^\oplus(f)$, where $aUC^\oplus(f)$ is
the average unambiguous parity certificate complexity of $f$. This improves
upon Chakraborty et al. An important consequence of the FEI conjecture is the
long-standing Mansour's conjecture. We show that a weaker version of FEI
already implies Mansour's conjecture: is $H(\hat{f}^2)\leq C
\min\{C^0(f),C^1(f)\}$?, where $C^0(f), C^1(f)$ are the 0- and 1-certificate
complexities of $f$, respectively.
  3) We study what FEI implies about the structure of polynomials that
1/3-approximate a Boolean function. We pose a conjecture (which is implied by
FEI): no ""flat"" degree-$d$ polynomial of sparsity $2^{\omega(d)}$ can
1/3-approximate a Boolean function. We prove this conjecture unconditionally
for a particular class of polynomials.

been shown to phase separate in buffer to form liquid-like phases. These
protein condensates serve as simple models for the investigation of the more
complex membrane-less organelles in cells. To understand the function of such
proteins in cells, the material properties of the condensates they form are
important. However, these material properties are not well understood. Here, we
develop a novel method based on optical traps to study the frequency-dependent
rheology and the surface tension of PGL-3 condensates as a function of salt
concentration. We find that PGL-3 droplets are predominantly viscous but also
exhibit elastic properties. As the salt concentration is reduced, their elastic
modulus, viscosity and surface tension increase. Our findings show that salt
concentration has a strong influence on the rheology and dynamics of protein
condensates suggesting an important role of electrostatic interactions for
their material properties.

temperatures. The magnetic state of matter, assembled by ordering the
electron's quantum spin property, represents a sizeable source of built-in
energy. We propose to create a direct source of electrical power at room
temperature (RT) by utilizing magnetic energy to harvest thermal fluctuations
on paramagnetic (PM) centers. Our spin engine rectifies current fluctuations
across the PM centers' spin states according to the electron spin by utilizing
so-called 'spinterfaces' with high spin polarization. As a rare experimental
event, we demonstrate how this path can generate 0.1nW at room temperature
across a 20 micron-wide spintronic device called the magnetic tunnel junction,
assembled using commonplace Co, C and MgO materials. The presence of this path
in our experiment, which also generates very high spintronic performance, is
confirmed by analytical and ab-initio calculations. Device downscaling, and the
ability for other materials systems than the spinterface to select a transport
spin channel at RT widens opportunities for routine device reproduction. The
challenging control over PM centers within the tunnel barrier's nanotransport
path may be addressed using oxide- and organic-based nanojunctions. At present
densities in MRAM products, this spin engine could lead to 'always-on' areal
power densities well beyond that generated by solar irradiation on earth.
Further developing this concept can fundamentally alter our energy-driven

samples of the distribution and exploiting the null space of the
Vandermonde-system that describes the nodes and weights, in order to select
which samples will be used as nodes in the quadrature rule. The main novelty of
the quadrature rule is that it can be constructed using any number of
dimensions, using any basis, in any space, and using any distribution. It is
demonstrated both theoretically and numerically that the rule always has
positive weights and therefore has high convergence rates for sufficiently
smooth functions. The convergence properties are demonstrated by approximating
the integral of the Genz test functions. The applicability of the quadrature
rule to complex uncertainty propagation cases is demonstrated by determining
the statistics of the flow over an airfoil governed by the Euler equations,

The disformal coupling leads to a negligible contribution to the Shapiro effect

contributes to the perihelion advance leading to a weak bound on the strength
of the disformal coupling itself. Finally, we remark that the disformal
coupling gives rise to a contribution to the perihelion advance which varies
quadratically with the mass of the heavy body, leading to possible strong
effects for stars in the vicinity of astrophysical black holes. For neutron
stars in a binary system, the disformal effects vary as the quartic power of

the dependence of $\gamma$ on redshift and surface mass density. When treating
$\delta$ (i.e., the slope of the luminosity density profile) as a universal
parameter for all lens galaxies, we find the limits on the cosmological
parameter $\Omega_m$ are quite weak and biased, and also heavily dependent on
the lens mass model in the scenarios of parameterizing $\gamma$ with three
different forms. When treating $\delta$ as an observable for each lens, the
unbiased estimate of $\Omega_m$ can be obtained only in the scenario of
including the dependence of $\gamma$ on both the redshift and the surface mass
density, that is $\Omega_m = 0.381^{+0.185}_{-0.154}$ at 68\% confidence level

practical significance, which answers whether the observed effects of some
compared treatments show a relevant difference in practice in realistic
scenarios. Even though plenty of standard techniques exist to assess
statistical significance, connecting it to practical significance is not
straightforward or routinely done; indeed, only a few empirical studies in
software engineering assess practical significance in a principled and
systematic way.
  In this paper, we argue that Bayesian data analysis provides suitable tools
to assess practical significance rigorously. We demonstrate our claims in a
case study comparing different test techniques. The case study's data was
previously analyzed (Afzal et al., 2015) using standard techniques focusing on
statistical significance. Here, we build a multilevel model of the same data,
which we fit and validate using Bayesian techniques. Our method is to apply
cumulative prospect theory on top of the statistical model to quantitatively
connect our statistical analysis output to a practically meaningful context.
This is then the basis both for assessing and arguing for practical
significance.
  Our study demonstrates that Bayesian analysis provides a technically rigorous
yet practical framework for empirical software engineering. A substantial side
effect is that any uncertainty in the underlying data will be propagated
through the statistical model, and its effects on practical significance are
made clear.
  Thus, in combination with cumulative prospect theory, Bayesian analysis
supports seamlessly assessing practical significance in an empirical software

for PM2.5 estimation. However, they generally described the complex AOD-PM2.5
relationship based on a linear hypothesis. Previous machine learning models
yielded great superiorities for fitting the nonlinear AOD-PM2.5 relationship,
but seldom allowed for its spatiotemporal variations. To simultaneously
consider the nonlinearity and spatiotemporal heterogeneities of AOD-PM2.5
relationship, geographically and temporally weighted neural networks (GTWNNs)
were developed for satellite-based estimation of ground-level PM2.5 in this
study. Using satellite AOD products, NDVI data, and meteorological factors over

spatial PM2.5 data of those locations with no ground stations could be
obtained. The proposed GTWNNs have achieved a better performance compared with
previous spatiotemporal models, i.e., daily geographically weighted regression
and geographically and temporally weighted regression. The sample-based and
site-based cross-validation R2 values of GTWNNs are 0.80 and 0.79,

G-doping based compensated p-p(v) junctions is reported. The p-p(v)
abbreviation is introduced to emphasize voltage dependence of G-doping level.
The p-type Si wafer is used for sample fabrication. First, two square islands
are shaped at the surface of the wafer. Next, entire Si surface is oxidized to
grow thin SiO2 insulating layer. Two windows are opened in SiO2 and nanograting
is fabricated inside one of the windows using laser interference lithography
followed by reactive ion etching. G-doping p-p(v) junction between p-type
substrate and the nanograting layer is formed. Next, metal contacts are
deposited on both islands to measure electrical characteristics of p-p(v)
junction. To exclude contact resistance input Van der Pauw method is used.
Obtained I-V curves are diode type with extremely low voltage drop in forward
direction and reduced reverse current. Experimental I-V curves are fitted to
the Shockley equation and ideality factor is found to be in the range of
0.2-0.14. Such a low values confirm that p-p(v) junction is fundamentally
different from the conventional p-n junction. This difference is ascribed to
G-doping which, unlike conventional doping, is external voltage dependent.

interesting, but challenging, problem. Different techniques have been proposed,
combining collaborative, content, social, and geographical signals; however it
is not trivial to decide which tech- nique works best, since this may depend on
the data density or the amount of activity logged for each user or item. At the
same time, cross-domain strategies have been exploited in the recommender
systems literature when dealing with (very) sparse situations, such as those
inherently arising when recommendations are produced based on information from
a single city.
  In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendation from a novel
perspective: applying cross-domain recommenda- tion techniques considering each
city as a different domain. We perform an experimental comparison of several
recommendation techniques in a temporal split under two conditions:
single-domain (only information from the target city is considered) and cross-
domain (information from many other cities is incorporated into the
recommendation algorithm). For the latter, we have explored two strategies to
transfer knowledge from one domain to another: testing the target city and
training a model with information of the k cities with more ratings or only
using the k closest cities.
  Our results show that, in general, applying cross-domain by proximity
increases the performance of the majority of the recom- menders in terms of
relevance. This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, where so many
domains (eight) are combined in the tourism context where a temporal split is
used, and thus we expect these results could provide readers with an overall
picture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment.

  of Agents @AAMAS2017",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned as a global network of connected
things enabling ubiquitous machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. With
estimations of billions of sensors and devices to be connected in the coming
years, the IoT has been advocated as having a great potential to impact the way
we live, but also how we work. However, the connectivity aspect in itself only
accounts for the underlying M2M infrastructure. In order to properly support
engineering IoT systems and applications, it is key to orchestrate
heterogeneous 'things' in a seamless, adaptive and dynamic manner, such that
the system can exhibit a goal-directed behaviour and take appropriate actions.
Yet, this form of interaction between things needs to take a user-centric
approach and by no means elude the users' requirements. To this end,
contextualisation is an important feature of the system, allowing it to infer
user activities and prompt the user with relevant information and interactions
even in the absence of intentional commands. In this work we propose a
role-based model for emergent configurations of connected systems as a means to
model, manage, and reason about IoT systems including the user's interaction
with them. We put a special focus on integrating the user perspective in order
to guide the emergent configurations such that systems goals are aligned with
the users' intentions. We discuss related scientific and technical challenges
and provide several uses cases outlining the concept of emergent
configurations.

the kinetic energy of the inflaton dominates over the potential. For these kind
of solutions, we show that the primordial power spectra depend strongly on the
choice of vacuum. We study in detail the case of adiabatic states of low order

intermediate scales. In the non-oscillating vacuum, there is power suppression
for large scales, but the rapid oscillations are absent. We argue that the
oscillations are due to the imposition of initial adiabatic conditions in the

Relativity. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of our results to changes of

the standard ADMM algorithm as a special case of our algorithm. Moreover, by
properly manipulating the proposed R-ADMM, we are able to provide two

needed for the Wald confidence interval by a factor of a half. We provide an
efficient procedure for transferring such uncertainties from the generator
matrix of the Markov chain to the corresponding rating migration probabilities
and, crucially, default probabilities.
  For our second contribution, we assume access to the full (continuous) data
set and propose a tractable and parsimonious self-exciting marked point
processes model able to capture the non-Markovian effect of rating momentum.
Compared to the Markov model, the non-Markov model yields higher probabilities
of default in the investment grades, but also lower default probabilities in
some speculative grades. Both findings agree with empirical observations and
have clear practical implications.
  We illustrate all methods using data from Moody's proprietary corporate
credit ratings data set. Implementations are available in the R package ctmcd.

Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm (R-ADMM) for optimization
of a separable convex cost function, whose terms are stored by a set of
interacting agents, one for each agent. Specifically the local cost stored by
each node is in general a function of both the state of the node and the states
of its neighbors, a framework that we refer to as `partition-based'
optimization. This framework presents a great flexibility and can be adapted to
a large number of different applications. We show that the partition-based
R-ADMM algorithm we introduce is linked to the relaxed Peaceman-Rachford
Splitting (R-PRS) operator which, historically, has been introduced in the
literature to find the zeros of sum of functions. Interestingly, making use of
non expansive operator theory, the proposed algorithm is shown to be provably
robust against random packet losses that might occur in the communication
between neighboring nodes. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
is confirmed by a set of compelling numerical simulations run over random
geometric graphs subject to i.i.d. random packet losses.

the aforementioned transformation allows us to formulate the network model as
an input-output system that is shown to be passive even if the network's lossy

that are viewed as multivariable input/output systems compatible with the
network formulation, and appropriate passivity conditions are imposed on those
that guarantee stability of the power network. We discuss the opportunities and
advantages offered by this approach while explaining how this allows the
inclusion of advanced models for both generation and power flows. Our analysis

search and optimisation problem is divided into groups and tasked with finding
optimal solutions. The penguins of a group perform simultaneous dives and work
as a team to collaboratively feed on fish the energy content of which
corresponds to the fitness of candidate solutions. Fish stocks have higher
fitness and concentration near areas of solution optima and thus drive the
search. Penguins can migrate to other places if their original habitat lacks
food. We identify two forms of penguin communication both intra-group and
inter-group which are useful in designing intensification and diversification
strategies. An efficient intensification strategy allows fast convergence to a
local optimum, whereas an effective diversification strategy avoids cyclic
behaviour around local optima and explores more effectively the space of
potential solutions. The proposed PeSOA algorithm has been validated on a
well-known set of benchmark functions. Comparative performances with six other
nature-inspired metaheuristics show that the PeSOA performs favourably in these
tests. A run-time analysis shows that the performance obtained by the PeSOA is
very stable at any time of the evolution horizon, making the PeSOA a viable
approach for real world applications.

literature. Regression depth (RD) of Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999), the most
famous one, is a direct extension of Tukey location depth (Tukey (1975)) to
regression.
  Like its location counterpart, the most remarkable advantage of the notion of
depth in regression is to directly introduce the maximum (or deepest)
regression depth estimator (aka depth induced median) for regression parameters
in a multi-dimensional setting. Classical questions for the regression depth
induced median include (i) is it a consistent estimator (or rather under what
sufficient conditions, it is consistent)? and (ii) is there any limiting
distribution?
  Bai and He (1999) (BH99) pioneered an attempt to answer these questions.
Under some stringent conditions on (i) the design points, (ii) the conditional
distributions of $y$ given $\bs{x}_i$, and (iii) the error distributions, BH99
proved the strong consistency of the depth induced median. Under another set of
conditions, BH99 showed the existence of the limiting distribution of the
estimator.
  This article establishes the strong consistency of the depth induced median
without any of the stringent conditions in BH99, and proves the existence of
the limiting distribution of the estimator by sufficient conditions and an
approach different from BH99.

of a fragmenting, gravitationally unstable disc with a gas-grain chemical code.
We use this to investigate the evolution of formamide (NH$_{\rm 2}$CHO), a
pre-biotic species, in both the disc and in the fragments that form within it.
Our results show that formamide remains frozen onto grains in the majority of
the disc where the temperatures are $<$100 K, with a predicted solid-phase
abundance that matches those observed in comets. Formamide is present in the
gas-phase in three fragments as a result of the high temperatures
($\geq$200\,K), but remains in the solid-phase in one colder ($\leq$150 K)
fragment. The timescale over which this occurs is comparable to the dust
sedimentation timescales, suggesting that any rocky core which is formed would
inherit their formamide content directly from the protosolar nebula.

kernel Hilbert space (hyper-RKHS), illustrates its utility for kernel learning
and out-of-sample extensions, and proves asymptotic convergence results for the
introduced regression models in an approximation theory view. Algorithmically,
we consider two regularized regression models with bivariate forms in this
space, including kernel ridge regression (KRR) and support vector regression
(SVR) endowed with hyper-RKHS, and further combine divide-and-conquer with
Nystr\""{o}m approximation for scalability in large sample cases. This framework
is general: the underlying kernel is learned from a broad class, and can be
positive definite or not, which adapts to various requirements in kernel
learning. Theoretically, we study the convergence behavior of regularized
regression algorithms in hyper-RKHS and derive the learning rates, which goes
beyond the classical analysis on RKHS due to the non-trivial independence of
pairwise samples and the characterisation of hyper-RKHS. Experimentally,
results on several benchmarks suggest that the employed framework is able to
learn a general kernel function form an arbitrary similarity matrix, and thus
achieves a satisfactory performance on classification tasks.

identified as a promising data source to complement or even enrich official

data is the detection of home location from individual users. The problem is
that little research exists on the validation (comparison with ground truth
datasets) or the uncertainty estimation of home detection methods, not at
individual user level, nor at nation-wide levels. In this paper, we present an
extensive empirical analysis of home detection methods when performed on a
nation-wide mobile phone dataset from France. We analyze the validity of 9
different Home Detection Algorithms (HDAs), and we assess different sources of
uncertainty. Based on 225 different set-ups for the home detection of around 18
million users we discuss different measures for validation and investigate
sensitivity to user choices such as HDA parameter choice and observation period
restriction. Our findings show that nation-wide performance of home detection
is moderate at best, with correlations to ground truth maximizing at 0.60 only.
Additionally, we show that time and duration of observation have a clear effect
on performance, and that the effect of HDA criteria and parameter choice are
rather small compared to other uncertainties. Our findings and discussion offer
welcoming insights to other practitioners who want to apply home detection on
similar datasets, or who are in need of an assessment of the challenges and
uncertainties related to mobilizing mobile phone data for official statistics.

characterize the close (up to 2.5 au) giant planet (GP) and brown dwarf (BD)
population around AF MS stars and compare this population to stars with
different masses. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph located on the 1.93m
telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence to observe 125 northern, MS AF
dwarfs. We used our dedicated SAFIR software to compute the RV and other
spectroscopic observables. We characterized the detected sub-stellar companions
and computed the GP and BD occurrence rates combining the present SOPHIE survey

around the F5-6V dwarfs HD16232 and HD113337. For the latter, we report an
additional RV variation that might be induced by a second GP on a wider orbit.
We also report the detection of fifteen binaries or massive sub-stellar
companions with high-amplitude RV variations or long-term RV trends. Based on
225 targets observed with SOPHIE or HARPS, we constraint the BD frequency
within 2-3 au around AF stars to be below 4 percents (1-sigma). For
Jupiter-mass GP within 2-3 au (periods below 1000 days), we found the
occurrence rate to be 3.7 (+3/-1) percents around AF stars with masses below
1.5 solar masses, and to be below 6 percents around AF stars with masses above
1.5 solar masses. For periods smaller than 10 days, we find the GP occurrence

with the GP frequency reported around FGK dwarfs and are compatible with a
possible increase of GP orbital periods with the stellar mass as predicted by

the carbon edge (~ 290 eV) before and after in situ exposure, enabling the
measurement of a significant photo-induced degradation of the organic group

the configuration of the ligand. Photo-induced degradation was more efficient
in the resist synthesized with pendant phenyl substituents than it was in the

methacrylate group was relatively efficient, with about half of the initial
ligands dissociated upon exposure. Our data reveal that the such dissociation
can produce different outcomes, depending on the structural configuration.
While all the organic groups were expected to detach and desorb from the resist

class of (sub)micrometer-size solid state systems. Mesoscopic-size hybrid
structures, containing superconducting elements, have become interesting
objects for basic research studies and various applications, ranging from
medical and astrophysical sensors to quantum computing. One of the most
important aspects of physics, governing the behavior of such systems, is the
finite concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, present in a
superconductor even well below the temperature of superconducting transition.
Those nonequilibrium excitations might limit the performance of a variety of
superconducting devices, like superconducting qubits, single-electron
turnstiles and microrefrigerators. On the contrary, in some applications, like
detectors of electromagnetic radiation, the nonequilibrium state is essential
for their operation. It is therefore of vital importance to study the
mechanisms of nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation in superconductors of
mesoscopic dimensions, where the whole structure can be considered as an
`interface'. At early stages of research the problem was mostly studied in
relatively massive systems and at high temperatures close to the critical
temperature of a superconductor. We review the recent progress in studies of
nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation in superconductors including the low
temperature limit. We also discuss the open physical questions and perspectives
of development in the field.

multiport network model (i.e., compound hybrid parameters), and the aggregate
behavior of the devices in each node by Th\'evenin Equivalents (TEs) and
Polynomial Models (PMs), respectively. The proposed VSI is a generalization of
the known L-index, which is achieved through the use of compound electrical
parameters, and the incorporation of TEs and PMs into its formal definition.
Notably, the proposed VSI can handle unbalanced polyphase power systems,
explicitly accounts for voltage-dependent behavior (represented by PMs), and is
computationally inexpensive. These features are valuable for the operation of
both transmission and distribution systems. Specifically, the ability to handle
the unbalanced polyphase case is of particular value for distribution systems.
In this context, it is proven that the compound hybrid parameters required for
the calculation of the VSI do exist under practical conditions (i.e., for lossy

voltage stability assessment using a benchmark system which is based on the

not only learns to correctly classify the labeled nodes, but also tries to be
consistent with the teacher on unlabeled nodes in more challenging situations,
such as a high dropout rate and graph collapse. As a teacher, it averages the
student model weights and generates more accurate predictions to lead the
student. In such a mutual-promoting process, both labeled and unlabeled samples

conditional heteroscedasticity) models have successfully described the
volatility dynamics of univariate asset returns, extending them to the
multivariate models with dynamic correlations has been difficult due to several
major problems. First, there are too many parameters to estimate if available
data are only daily returns, which results in unstable estimates. One solution
to this problem is to incorporate additional observations based on intraday
asset returns, such as realized covariances. Second, since multivariate asset
returns are not synchronously traded, we have to use the largest time intervals
such that all asset returns are observed in order to compute the realized
covariance matrices. However, in this study, we fail to make full use of the
available intraday informations when there are less frequently traded assets.
Third, it is not straightforward to guarantee that the estimated (and the
realized) covariance matrices are positive definite. Our contributions are the
following: (1) we obtain the stable parameter estimates for the dynamic
correlation models using the realized measures, (2) we make full use of
intraday informations by using pairwise realized correlations, (3) the
covariance matrices are guaranteed to be positive definite, (4) we avoid the
arbitrariness of the ordering of asset returns, (5) we propose the flexible
correlation structure model (e.g., such as setting some correlations to be zero

shed light on the mechanisms behind ballistic and diffusive transport regimes

our study for the specific case of a 1D bosonic chain subject to local Lindblad
dissipators at the boundaries. In addition, the chain is also subject to
self-consistent reservoirs at each site, which are used to tune the transport
between ballistic and diffusive. As a result, we find that the CMI is
independent of the chain size $L$ in the ballistic regime, but decays
algebraically with $L$ in the diffusive case. Finally, we also show how this

angular separation. We show that this design gives better contrast at lower
separation from a bright star. This is shown for diffraction-limited (for
perfect and imperfect optics) and seeing-limited speckle images, assuming equal

in measurement of the point spread function. To compensate for the wider point
spread function of the short axis, images should be taken at different rotation
angles, either by rotating the telescope around the optical axis or by allowing
a stationary mirror array to scan different parallactic angles with time.
Images taken at different rotation angles are added using the proper image
coaddition algorithms developed by Zackay & Ofek. The final image has the same
contrast in all angles, rather than in specific areas of diffraction nulls. We

be instantiated in an `unknown' target domain to obtain analogous programs. To
this end, we introduce algebraic operations for program modularity and
illustrate, by giving numerous examples, that programs have nice

weak modular product of two simple graphs to be perfect. The weak modular
product differs from the direct product by also encoding non-adjacencies of the
factor graphs in its edges. This work is motivated by the following: a 1978
theorem of Kozen states that two graphs on $n$ vertices are isomorphic if and
only if there is a clique of size $n$ in the weak modular product between the
two graphs. Furthermore, a straightforward corollary of Kozen's theorem and
Lov\'{a}sz's sandwich theorem is if the weak modular product between two graphs
is perfect, then checking if the graphs are isomorphic is polynomial in $n$.
Interesting cases include complete multipartite graphs and disjoint unions of
cliques. All perfect weak modular products have factors that fall into classes
of graphs for which testing isomorphism is already known to be polynomial in
the number of vertices.

(B-Rep), where only the objects' surfaces with their corresponding edges and

B-Rep models are not necessarily watertight. These 'dirty geometries' cause
major difficulties in computational analysis because even basic geometric
operations such as point-in-membership tests fail, not to mention meshing as
required by classical boundary conforming finite element methods.
Alternatively, objects may be represented by Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG),
which is strongly related to Procedural Modeling (PM). In this context, the
model is created using Boolean operations on primitives. The modeling process
is then either stored as a sequence (PM), or as a construction tree (CSG). In
contrast to B-Rep models, CSG models are intrinsically water-tight. To run a
finite element simulation on a water-tight CSG model, two alternatives are
possible: (i) it can either be converted to a B-Rep-model to obtain a finite
element mesh or (ii) its implicit description can be used directly by applying
an embedded domain approach, like the Finite Cell Method (FCM). In this
contribution, we present a design-through analysis methodology using CSG and

described by a single effective field in terms of which the constraints appear
to be one-dimensional, the description of MLNN, involves multiple fields, and
the constraints acquire a multidimensional character. We first study the models

isostatic, the sphere universality class is recovered, we then write the exact

telescopes. We reach surface brightness (SB) limits of mu_2.2m = 27.5 mag
arcsec-2 (Cous R) and mu_VST = 28.7mag arcsec-2 (r) that show the XUV
pseudoring of the galaxy in detail. Additionally, a wavelet filtering of the HI
data cube from our deep observations with E/VLA telescope allowed us to reach a
column density of N_HI = 8.9x10^18 cm -2 (5sigma) (28""x28"" beam), lower than in
any isolated galaxy. We confirm that the HI extends farther than 4xr_25 in all
directions. Furthermore, we detect for the first time two gaseous structures
(10^6 Msol) in the outskirts. The g-r colour index image from 1.23m shows
extremely blue colours in certain regions of the pseudoring where
N_HI>8.5x10^20 cm-2 , whereas the rest show red colours. Galactic cirrus
contaminate the field, setting an unavoidable detection limit at 28.5mag
arcsec-2 (r). We detect no stellar link within 1degx1deg or gaseous link within
40'x40' between CIG 96 and any companion. The isolation criteria rule out
interactions with other similar-sized galaxies for at least 2.7Gyr. Using
existing stellar evolution models, the age of the pseudoring is estimated at
1Gyr or older. Undetected previously accreted companions and cold gas accretion
remain as the main hypothesis to explain the optical pseudoring and HI features
of CIG 96.

the larger broadening of plasmons for zigzag ribbons is due to their edge

electronic wavefunction oscillations induced by inter-valley coupling.

towards clinical decision support. However, current methods in radiomics are
limited to using single images for the extraction of these textural features
and may limit the applicable scope of radiomics in different clinical settings.
Thus, in the current form, they are not capable of capturing the true
underlying tissue characteristics in high dimensional multiparametric imaging
space. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a multiparametric imaging
radiomic framework termed MPRAD for extraction of radiomic features from high
dimensional datasets. MPRAD was tested on two different organs and diseases;
breast cancer and cerebrovascular accidents in brain, commonly referred to as
stroke. The MPRAD framework classified malignant from benign breast lesions
with excellent sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 80.5% respectively with
an AUC of 0.88 providing a 9%-28% increase in AUC over single radiomic
parameters. More importantly, in breast, the glandular tissue MPRAD were
similar between each group with no significance differences. Similarly, the
MPRAD features in brain stroke demonstrated increased performance in
distinguishing the perfusion-diffusion mismatch compared to single parameter
radiomics and there were no differences within the white and gray matter

Kuramoto model and other coupled oscillator models on networks. So far, coupled
oscillator research focused on phase synchronized solutions. Yet, global
constraints on oscillators may forbid synchronized state, rendering phase
balanced states as the relevant stable state. If for example oscillators are
driving the contractions of a fluid filled volume, conservation of fluid volume
constraints oscillators to balanced states as characterized by a vanishing
Kuramoto order parameter. It has previously been shown that stable, balanced
patterns in the Kuramoto model exist on circulant graphs. However, which
non-circulant graphs first of all allow for balanced states and what
characterizes the balanced states is unknown. Here, we derive rules of how to
build non-circulant, planar graphs allowing for balanced states from the simple
cycle graph by adding loops or edges to it. We thereby identify different
classes of small planar networks allowing for balanced states. Investigating
the balanced states' characteristics, we find that the variance in basin
stability scales linearly with the size of the graph for these networks. We
introduce the balancing ratio as a new order parameter based on the basin
stability approach to classify balanced states on networks and evaluate it
analytically for a subset of the network classes. Our results offer an
analytical description of non-circulant graphs supporting stable, balanced

benefits. In this paper, we develop a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC)
strategy for battery thermal and energy management of electric vehicle (EV),
aiming at improving fuel economy through real-time prediction and optimization.
In the first layer, the long-term traffic flow information and an approximate
model reflective of the relatively slow battery temperature dynamics are
leveraged to minimize energy consumption required for battery cooling while
maintaining the battery temperature within the desired operating range. In the
second layer, the scheduled battery thermal and state of charge (SOC)
trajectories planned to achieve long-term battery energy-optimal thermal
behavior are used as the reference over a short horizon to regulate the battery
temperature. Additionally, an intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH)
algorithm is developed to compensate for the mismatch between the actual and
predicted driving conditions and reduce the chance for battery temperature
constraint violation. The simulation results show that, depending on the
driving cycle, the proposed two-layer MPC is able to save 2.8-7.9% of the
battery energy compared to the traditional rule-based controller in connected

scale-invariant hidden scalar-QCD, which has been used to explain the dynamical
origin of the electroweak scale. In addition to the previous works, our new
effective model includes the dynamical scale-anomaly effect from the hidden QCD
gluons, to explicitly break the classical-scale invariance at the level of an
effective field theory, which is known as the leading-order scale-symmetry
(LOSS). In the phenomenological analysis, the proposed model predicts a light
composite dilaton composed of hidden scalar quarks and gluons with the mass
around electroweak scale (around 280 GeV), and has only one input parameter,
which is the mixing angle between the Higgs boson and the composite dilaton.
Our result for the dilaton mass is in accord with the lattice simulation for
scalar QCD, where the scalar-quark bound states acquire a large effective mass
from the hidden gluon contribution. Furthermore, we predict several significant
deviations from the SM, like the diHiggs production cross sections (maximally
about 10 times larger than the SM prediction), that could be directly tested at
the high luminosity LHC. It is also the first study for the diHiggs production
signal predicted from a scale(conformal)-invariant hidden sector, even from
dark/hidden QCD. Our proposed effective model is thus significantly different
than the conventional realization of scale-invariant hidden-scalar QCD without
the scale anomaly effect, and can potentially provide a competitive explanation
for many exotic phenomena beyond the standard model, such as new dark matter
candidates and a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition.

particular noise strength. The fact that the SNR is amplified as the number of
micro domains (N) increase shows that the weak periodic signal plays a decisive

research is done, from designing new materials and predicting their properties
to assisting drug discovery to advancing cybersecurity. Recently, we added to
this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner)
combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the
realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other
applications, semiconductor QDs are a candidate system for building quantum
computers. The present-day tuning techniques for bringing the QD devices into a
desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics
do not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for
even near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable
protocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed
by experimentalists is thus of great importance. To implement the machine
learning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device
characteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus
the applied electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we describe the methodology for
generating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional
neural networks. We show that the learner's accuracy in recognizing the state
of a device is ~96.5 % in both current- and charge-sensor-based training. We
also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for
further research: QFlow lite - a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the
dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and
differentiate between states in experimental data. This work gives the
definitive reference for the new dataset that will help enable researchers to
use it in their experiments or to develop new machine learning approaches and
concepts.

opened a new pathway for the generation of ultrashort pulses and low-noise
frequency combs with gigahertz to terahertz repetition rates, enabling
applications in frequency metrology, astronomy, optical coherent
communications, and laser-based ranging. A main challenge for soliton
generation, in particular in ultra-high-Q resonators, is the sudden change of
circulating intracavity power during the onset of soliton generation. This
sudden power change requires precise control of the seed laser frequency and
power or fast control of the resonator temperature. Here, we report a robust
and simple way to increase the stability range of the soliton regime by using
an auxiliary laser that passively stabilizes the intracavity power. In our
experiments with fused silica resonators, we are able to extend the pump laser
frequency stability range of microresonator solitons by two orders of
magnitude, which enables soliton generation by slow and manual tuning of the
pump laser into resonance and at unprecedented low power levels. Both single-
and multi-soliton mode-locked states are generated in a 1.3-mm-diameter fused
silica microrod resonator with a free spectral range of ~50.6 GHz, at a 1554 nm
pump wavelength at threshold powers <3 mW. Moreover, with a smaller
230-{\mu}m-diameter microrod, we demonstrate soliton generation at 780 {\mu}W
threshold power. The passive enhancement of the stability range of
microresonator solitons paves the way for robust and low threshold microcomb
systems with substantially relaxed stability requirements for the pump laser
source. In addition, this method could be useful in a wider range of
microresonator applications that require reduced sensitivity to external

on numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the shape and spin of
minihaloes with masses of $M \sim 10^5$--$10^7 \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$ which are of
particular interest as they are the sites where the first stars in the Universe
form. We analyse a large sample of these minihaloes, selected from a high
resolution cosmological simulation. The first minihaloes form at $z \simeq 24$
and by the end of the simulation at $z \simeq 14$ our sample includes $\sim
9000$ minihaloes. We find that the spin parameter of the minihaloes follows a
log-normal distribution with minimal dependence on redshift. Most minihaloes
are prolate, but those formed at the highest redshifts are more prolate than
those formed at lower redshifts. On the scale of the virial radius, there is a
good correlation between the shape and spin of the gas and that of the dark
matter. However, this correlation breaks down in gas which is cooling and
undergoing gravitational collapse. We show, contrary to previous assumptions,
that although the direction of the spin of the central dense gas correlates
well with that of the halo, the magnitude of the spin of the dense gas is
uncorrelated with that of the halo. Therefore, measurements of the spin of
minihaloes on large scales tell us little about the angular momentum of the gas

motion resonance and undergoing type-I migration in a disc. We present a
detailed analysis of the resonance valid for any value of $q$. Expressions for
the equilibrium eccentricities, mean motions and departure from exact resonance
are derived in the case of smooth convergent migration. We show that this
departure, not assumed to be small, is such that period ratio normally exceeds,
but can also be less than, $ (q+1)/q.$ Departure from exact resonance as a
function of time for systems starting in resonance and undergoing divergent
migration is also calculated. We discuss observed systems in which two low mass
planets are close to a first-order resonance. We argue that the data are
consistent with only a small fraction of the systems having been captured in
resonance. Furthermore, when capture does happen, it is not in general during
smooth convergent migration through the disc but after the planets reach the
disc inner parts. We show that although resonances may be disrupted when the
inner planet enters a central cavity, this alone cannot explain the spread of
observed separations. Disruption is found to result in either the system moving
interior to the resonance by a few percent, or attaining another resonance. We
postulate two populations of low mass planets: a small one for which extensive
smooth migration has occurred, and a larger one that formed approximately

living tissue generate and maintain patterns of voltage gradients induced by
differing concentrations of charged ions. A growing body of research suggests
that bioelectric patterns represent an ancient system that plays a key role in
guiding many important developmental processes including tissue regeneration,
tumor suppression, and embryogenesis. Understanding the relationship between
high-level bioelectric patterns and low-level biochemical processes might also
enable powerful new forms of synthetic biology. A key open question in this
area is understanding how a collection of cells, interacting with each other
and the extracellular environment only through simple ligand bindings and ion
fluxes, can compute non-trivial patterns and perform non-trivial information
processing tasks. The standard approach to this question is to model a given
bioelectrical network as a system of differential equations and then explore
its behavior using simulation techniques. In this paper, we propose applying a
computational approach. In more detail, we present the cellular bioelectric
model (CBM), a new computational model that captures the primary capabilities
and constraints of bioelectric interactions between cells and their
environment. We use this model to investigate several important topics in
cellular bioelectricity, including symmetry breaking and information
processing. Among other results, we describe and analyze a basic bioelectric
strategy the efficiently stabilizes arbitrary cell networks into maximal
independent sets (a structure known to play a role in the nervous system
development of flys), and prove cells in our model are Turing complete in their
ability to process information encoded in their initial voltage potential.

argue that this reduction is mainly because of the near-field coupling between
metasurface elements, which results in response from each element being
different from the one anticipated by design simulations, which are commonly
conducted for each individual element being placed in an artificial periodic
arrangement. In order to study the influence of near-field coupling, we
fabricate meta-elements of varying sizes arranged in quasi-periodic arrays so
that the immediate environment of same size elements is different for those
located in the middle and at the border of the arrays. We study the near-field
using a phase-resolved scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy
(s-SNOM) and conducting numerical simulations. By comparing the near-field maps
from elements of the same size but different placements we evaluate the
near-field coupling strength, which is found to be significant for large and
densely packed elements. This technique is quite generic and can be used
practically for any metasurface type in order to precisely measure the
near-field response from each individual element and identify malfunctioning
ones, providing feedback to their design and fabrication, thereby allowing one
to improve the efficiency of the whole metasurface.

means for automating repetitive data manipulation tasks, frequently presented

stau mass usually has an upper bound since its annihilation rate becomes small
with the increase of DM mass. Inspired by this observation, we examine the
upper limit of stau mass in the parameter space with a large mixing of staus.
We find that the stau pair may dominantly annihilate into dibosons and hence
the upper bound on the stau mass ($\sim400$ GeV) obtained from the $f\bar{f}$
final states can be relaxed. Imposing the DM relic density constraint and
requiring a long lifetime of the present vacuum, we find that the lighter stau
mass can be as heavy as about 1.4 TeV for the stau maximum mixing. However, if
requiring the present vacuum to survive during the thermal history of the

the spatial curvature, or that of the cosmological constant, torsion can
drastically change the evolution of the classic homogeneous and isotropic

expansion. For instance, in the presence of torsion, the Milne and the
Einstein-de Sitter universes evolve like the de Sitter model. We also show
that, by changing the expansion rate of the early universe, torsion can affect
the primordial nucleosynthesis of helium-4. We use this sensitivity to impose
strong cosmological bounds on the relative strength of the associated torsion

of torsion can \textit{reduce} the production of primordial helium-4, unlike
other changes to the standard thermal history of an isotropic universe.
Finally, turning to static spacetimes, we find that there exist torsional
analogues of the classic Einstein static universe, with all three types of
spatial geometry. These models can be stable when the torsion field and the
universe's spatial curvature have the appropriate profiles.

non-thermal, radio emission associated with its bipolar jet. To investigate the
nature of this emission, we present sensitive ($\sigma\sim2\,\mu {\rm Jy
\,beam^{-1}}$), Karl G.\ Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) $6$ and $10\,{\rm GHz}$
observations. Over $3.81\,{\rm yr}$, no proper motion is observed towards the
non-thermal radio knot C, previously thought to be a bowshock. Its quasi-static
nature, spatially-resolved variability and offset from the central jet axis
supports a scenario whereby it is instead a stationary shock driven into the
surrounding medium by the jet. Towards the internal working surface, knot A, we
derive an inclination-corrected, absolute velocity of $258\pm23\, {\rm
km\,s^{-1}}$. DG Tau A's receding counterjet displays a spatially-resolved
increase in flux density, indicating a variable mass loss event, the first time
such an event has been observed in the counterjet. For this ejection, we
measure an ionised mass loss rate of $(3.7\pm1.0) \times 10^{-8}\, {\rm
M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$ during the event. A contemporaneous ejection in the
approaching jet isn't seen, showing it to be an asymmetric process. Finally,
using radiative transfer modelling, we find that the extent of the radio
emission can only be explained with the presence of shocks, and therefore
reionisation, in the flow. Our modelling highlights the need to consider the
relative angular size of optically thick, and thin, radio emission from a jet,
to the synthesised beam, when deriving its physical conditions from its
spectral index.

In our model construction, we also arrive at a structure similar to ReLU

Additionally, the pooling function is derived as a marginalization of spatial

Since our models are comprised of finite state distributions (FSD) as variables

both in simulation and with a real robot (industrial robotic arm Fanuc) with a
total of 13 different objects. The robot is able to find a good object-specific
optimization in 68 (simulation) or 40 (real) trials. In simulation, we
demonstrate the benefit of the transfer learning based on visual similarity, as
opposed to an amnesic learning (i.e. learning from scratch all the time).
Moreover, with the real robot, we show that the method consistently outperforms
the manual optimization from an expert with less than 2 hours of training time
to achieve more than 88% of success.

  Machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning or learning from
demonstration can be very appealing to AI designers that want efficient and
realistic behaviors in their agents. However, those algorithms seldom provide
guarantees for solving the given task in all different situations while keeping
the agent safe. Instead, such guarantees are often easier to find for manually
designed model-based approaches. In this paper we exploit the modularity of
behavior trees to extend a given design with an efficient, but possibly
unreliable, machine learning component in a way that preserves the guarantees.
The approach is illustrated with an inverted pendulum example.

delay requirements and offload traffic from peak periods. By storing parts of
the popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested
files in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case,
when a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device(D2D)
communication is performed. D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks
is also a new paradigm for the upcoming wireless systems. By allowing a pair of
adjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D communication can achieve
higher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay. In this
work, we propose an efficient learning-based caching algorithm operating
together with a non-parametric estimator to minimize the average transmission
delay in D2D-enabled cellular networks. It is assumed that the system does not
have any prior information regarding the popularity of the files, and the
non-parametric estimator is aimed at learning the intensity function of the
file requests. An algorithm is devised to determine the best <file,user> pairs
that provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy
with very low transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also
extended to address a more general scenario, in which the distributions of
fading coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over
time. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is
verified by comparing it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply
cache their favorite files, and by comparing with a probabilistic algorithm, in
which the users cache a file with a probability that is proportional to its

successful application to diverse fields of science. With the aim of further
advancing the understanding of the brain's functional connectivity, we propose
to evaluate a network metric which we term the geodesic entropy. This entropy,
in a way that can be made precise, quantifies the Shannon entropy of the
distance distribution to a specific node from all other nodes. Measurements of
geodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information
of a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the
network topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural
information has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained
activity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized
criticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and
methods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the
functional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy
is able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two
different states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking
state and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of
the nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca
diverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional
brain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger
geodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic
entropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why
it may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain
and other empirical networks.

interconnected computing units (or nodes) that execute highly complex
scientific simulations to support scientific research. Monitoring such
facilities, in real-time, is essential to ensure that the system operates at
peak efficiency. Such systems are typically monitored using a variety of
measurement and log data which capture the state of the various components
within the system at regular intervals of time. As modern HPC systems grow in
capacity and complexity, the data produced by current resource monitoring tools
is at a scale that it is no longer feasible to be visually monitored by
analysts. We propose a method that transforms the multi-dimensional output of
resource monitoring tools to a low dimensional representation that facilitates
the understanding of the behavior of a High Performance Computing (HPC) system.
The proposed method automatically extracts the low-dimensional signal in the
data which can be used to track the system efficiency and identify performance
anomalies. The method models the resource usage data as a three dimensional
tensor (capturing resource usage of all compute nodes for difference resources
over time). A dynamic matrix factorization algorithm, called dynamicMF, is
proposed to extract a low-dimensional temporal signal for each node, which is

gain further improvements of over 5% $F_{0.5}$ score. When attempting to

In their interactions with others, they try to read others' intentions and make
an image of others to choose their actions accordingly. While the way in which
players choose their actions depending on such intentions has been investigated
in game theory, how dynamic changes in intentions by mutually reading others'
intentions are incorporated into game theory has not been explored. We present
a novel formulation of game theory in which players read others' intentions and
change their own through an iterated game. Here, intention is given as a
function of the other's action and the own action to be taken accordingly as
the dependent variable, while the mutual recognition of intention is
represented as the functional dynamics. It is shown that a player suffers no
disadvantage when he/she recognizes the other's intention, whereas the
functional dynamics reach equilibria in which both players' intentions are
optimized. These cover a classical Nash and Stackelberg equilibria but we
extend them in this study: Novel equilibria exist depending on the degree of
mutual recognition. Moreover, the degree to which each player recognizes the
other can also differ. This formulation is applied to resource competition,
duopoly, and prisoner's dilemma games. For example, in the resource competition
game with player-dependent capacity on gaining the resource, the superior
player's recognition leads to the exploitation of the other, while the inferior
player's recognition leads to cooperation through which both players' payoffs
increase.

explores a thinging schematization for ethical theories that can serve a role

in machine learning. Considerable efforts have been made to advance the

development of more sophisticated models and the incorporation of different
expressive modalities (e. g., speech, face, and physiology). In this paper,
motivated by the benefit of difficulty awareness in a human learning procedure,
we propose a novel machine learning framework, namely, Dynamic Difficulty
Awareness Training (DDAT), which sheds fresh light on the research -- directly
exploiting the difficulties in learning to boost the machine learning process.
The DDAT framework consists of two stages: information retrieval and
information exploitation. In the first stage, we make use of the reconstruction
error of input features or the annotation uncertainty to estimate the
difficulty of learning specific information. The obtained difficulty level is
then used in tandem with original features to update the model input in a
second learning stage with the expectation that the model can learn to focus on
high difficulty regions of the learning process. We perform extensive
experiments on a benchmark database (RECOLA) to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The experimental results show that our approach
outperforms related baselines as well as other well-established time-continuous
emotion prediction systems, which suggests that dynamically integrating the
difficulty information for neural networks can help enhance the learning
process.

exhibiting long-range correlated fluctuation fields. Based on full-scale
numerical simulations on a class of such materials, an ansatz is proposed that
allows to decompose the kinematics into three parts, i.e. a smooth mean
displacement field, a long-range correlated fluctuating field, and a local
microfluctuation part. With this decomposition, a homogenized solution is
defined by ensemble averaging the solutions obtained from a family of
translated microstructural realizations. Minimizing the resulting homogenized
energy, a micromorphic continuum emerges in terms of the average displacement
and the amplitude of the patterning long-range microstructural fluctuation
fields. Since full integration of the ensemble averaged global energy (and
hence also the corresponding Euler--Lagrange equations) is computationally
prohibitive, a more efficient approximative computational framework is
developed. The framework relies on local energy density approximations in the
neighbourhood of the considered Gauss integration points, while taking into
account the smoothness properties of the effective fields and periodicity of
the microfluctuation pattern. Finally, the implementation of the proposed
methodology is briefly outlined and its performance is demonstrated by
comparing its predictions against full scale simulations of a representative
example.

conducted solely on voluntary checkin datasets collected from social apps such

information about more prosaic aspects of people's lives is sparse. This not
only limits our understanding of users' daily routines, but more importantly
the modeling assumptions developed based on characteristics of recreation-based

previous methods significantly degrade performance on our data with dense(r)

and compact vectors, and has attracted much attention in recent years due to
its ability to capture complex structure relationships inside networks.
However, existing network representation methods are commonly designed for
homogeneous information networks where all the nodes (entities) of a network
are of the same type, e.g., papers in a citation network. In this paper, we
propose a universal network representation approach (UNRA), that represents
different types of nodes in heterogeneous information networks in a continuous
and common vector space. The UNRA is built on our latest mutually updated
neural language module, which simultaneously captures inter-relationship among
homogeneous nodes and node-content correlation. Relationships between different
types of nodes are also assembled and learned in a unified framework.
Experiments validate that the UNRA achieves outstanding performance, compared
to six other state-of-the-art algorithms, in node representation, node
classification, and network visualization. In node classification, the UNRA
achieves a 3\% to 132\% performance improvement in terms of accuracy.

not do it. If you think you can develop a better cryptography method anyway. We
present a brief discussion about some well known cryptography methods and how
our model fails against the traditional attacks. We do not want to discourage
anybody, we just want to show that, despite of the importance of developing
better cryptography models, it is a very hard task.
