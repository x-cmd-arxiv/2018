magnetic Fe layers and hard magnetic Dysprosium (Dy) layers at low temperatures
(4.2 - 120K). For our experiments we prepared thin films of Fe and Dy and
multilayers of Fe/Dy by ultra-high vacuum sputtering. The magnetic properties
of each material were determined with a superconducting quantum interference
device. Furthermore, we performed magnetoresistance measurements with similarly
grown, microstructured devices, where the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)
effect was used to identify the magnetization state of the samples. By
analyzing and comparing the corresponding data of Fe and Dy, we show that the
presence of a Dy layer on top of the Fe layer significantly influences its
magnetic properties and makes it magnetically harder. We perform a systematic
evaluation of this effect and its dependence on temperature and on the
thickness of the soft magnetic layer. All experimental results can consistently
be explained with exchange coupling at the interface between the Fe and the Dy
layer. Our experiments also yield a negative sign of the AMR effect of thin Dy
films, and an increase of the Dy films' Curie temperature, which is due to
growth conditions.

In this approach, one gets a surrogate dataset by sampling from the full data,
and then obtains an approximate solution by solving the subsampled optimization
based on the surrogate. One main theoretical contributions are to provide the
asymptotic properties of the approximate solution with respect to the exact
solution as statistical guarantees, and to rigorously derive an accurate
approximation of the mean squared error (MSE) and an approximately unbiased MSE

the context that a confidence region on the exact solution is provided using

optimal sampling method, Hessian-based sampling, whose probabilities are
proportional to the norms of Newton directions. Numerical experiments with

the first approach the coefficients of the intensity function are assigned
independent gamma priors, leading to a closed form posterior distribution. On

asymptotically concentrates around the ""true"", data-generating intensity

derive the statistical characteristic of the cumulative interference in
finite-sized mmWave networks considering configuration randomness across
spatial and spectral domains while including the effect of blockages.
Subsequently, using the derived interference model we set up a likelihood ratio

the regime of the network from an arbitrarily located user standpoint. Unlike
traditional networks, in mmWave networks, different likelihood of experiencing
an interference-limited regime can be observed at different locations.

Redshift Survey, Weak Lensing and Cluster Growth and thus fully embrace the
fact that the imaging and spectroscopic elements of the HLS will be realized as
an integrated observing program, and they jointly impose requirements on
performance and operations. WFIRST is designed to be able to deliver a
definitive result on the origin of cosmic acceleration. It is not optimized for
Figure of Merit sensitivity but for control of systematic uncertainties and for
having multiple techniques each with multiple cross-checks. Our SIT work
focuses on understanding the potential systematics in the WFIRST DE

  (IV) Symposium",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurately predicting the possible behaviors of traffic participants is an
essential capability for future autonomous vehicles. The majority of current
researches fix the number of driving intentions by considering only a specific
scenario. However, distinct driving environments usually contain various
possible driving maneuvers. Therefore, a intention prediction method that can
adapt to different traffic scenarios is needed. To further improve the overall
vehicle prediction performance, motion information is usually incorporated with
classified intentions. As suggested in some literature, the methods that
directly predict possible goal locations can achieve better performance for
long-term motion prediction than other approaches due to their automatic
incorporation of environment constraints. Moreover, by obtaining the temporal
information of the predicted destinations, the optimal trajectories for
predicted vehicles as well as the desirable path for ego autonomous vehicle
could be easily generated. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-based Intention
and Motion Prediction (SIMP) method, which can be adapted to any driving
scenarios by using semantic-defined vehicle behaviors. It utilizes a
probabilistic framework based on deep neural network to estimate the
intentions, final locations, and the corresponding time information for
surrounding vehicles. An exemplar real-world scenario was used to implement and
examine the proposed method.

Quantum dots provide ideal on-chip quantum light sources. However, achieving
quantum interaction between multiple quantum dots on-a-chip is a challenging

tuning technique and long-range quantum interaction. Here, we demonstrate
quantum interactions between distant two quantum dots on a nanophotonic

the quantum dots to the same optical mode of a nanophotonic waveguide and
overcome spectral mismatch by incorporating on-chip thermal tuners. We observe
their quantum interactions of the form of super-radiant emission, where the two
dots collectively emit faster than each dot individually. Creating
super-radiant emission from integrated quantum emitters could enable compact
chip-integrated photonic structures that exhibit long-range quantum

scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The particular NC inflationary
setting produces entirely new consequences. We first analyze the free field
case and subsequently examine the situation where the scalar field is subjected
to a polynomial and exponential potentials. We propose to use a canonical
deformation between momenta, in a spatially flat FLRW universe, and while the
Friedmann equation remains unaffected the Friedmann acceleration equation (and
thus the Klein-Gordon equation) is modified by an extra term linear in the NC
parameter. This concrete noncommutativity on the momenta allows interesting
dynamics that other NC models seem not to allow. Let us be more precise. This
extra term behaves as the sole explicit pressure that under the right
circumstances implies a period of accelerated expansion of the universe. We
find that in the absence of the scalar field potential, and in contrast with
the commutative case, in which the scale factor always decelerates, we obtain
an inflationary phase for small negative values of the NC parameter.
Subsequently, the period of accelerated expansion is smoothly replaced by an
appropriate deceleration phase providing an interesting model regarding the
graceful exit problem in inflationary models.
  Moreover, in the case of the free scalar field, we show that not only the
horizon problem is solved but also there is some resemblance between the
evolution equation of the scale factor associated to our model and that for the
$R^2$ (Starobinsky) inflationary model. Therefore, our herein NC model not only
can be taken as an appropriate scenario to get a successful kinetic inflation,
but also is a convenient setting to obtain inflationary universe possessing the
graceful exit when scalar field potentials are present.

account for the behavior of quantum particles, later extended to quantum field
theories and to statistical physics. Path-integration enables a
trajectory-centric representation of the pedestrian motion, directly providing
the probability of observing a given trajectory. This appears as the most
natural language to describe the statistical properties of pedestrian dynamics
in generic settings. In a given venue, individual trajectories can belong to
many possible usage patterns and, within each of them, they can display wide
variability.
  We provide first a primer on path-integration, and we introduce and discuss
the path-integral functional probability measure for pedestrian dynamics in the
diluted limit. As an illustrative example, we connect the path-integral
description to a Langevin model that we developed previously for a particular
crowd flow condition (the flow in a narrow corridor). Building on our previous
real-life measurements, we provide a quantitatively correct path-integral
representation for this condition. Finally, we show how the path-integral
formalism can be used to evaluate the probability of rare-events (in the case
of the corridor, U-turns).

families of distributions and have been extensively studied in computer science
and statistics. We give the first identity tester for this problem with {\em
sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching
sample complexity lower bound.
  In more detail, let $q$ be an unknown $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram
distribution in fixed dimension $d$, and $p$ be an explicitly given
$d$-dimensional $k$-histogram. We want to correctly distinguish, with
probability at least $2/3$, between the case that $p = q$ versus $\|p-q\|_1
\geq \epsilon$. We design an algorithm for this hypothesis testing problem with
sample complexity $O((\sqrt{k}/\epsilon^2) 2^{d/2} \log^{2.5 d}(k/\epsilon))$
that runs in sample-polynomial time. Our algorithm is robust to model
misspecification, i.e., succeeds even if $q$ is only promised to be {\em close}

complexity lower bound of $(\sqrt{k}/\epsilon^2) \cdot \Omega(\log(k)/d)^{d-1}$

bounds are nearly matching. Prior to our work, the sample complexity of the

complexity was known, even for $d=2$. Our new upper and lower bounds have

$\epsilon$ that accounts for the kinetic energy stored in the vertical motion

during free flight, mimicking the energy gain by collisions with the vibrating

The combination of seven narrow and five broadband filters with a typical
photometric-depth of r<21.5 provides dz/(1+z)=0.01 photo-z estimates. A
precision of dz/(1+z)=0.005 is obtained for the 177 galaxies brighter than
magnitude r<17. To foresee the precision beyond the spectroscopic sample, we
designed a set of simulations in which real cluster galaxies are modeled and
reinjected inside the images at different signal-to-noise. A precision of
dz/(1+z)=0.02 and dz/(1+z)=0.03 is expected at <r>= 18-22, respectively.
Complementarily, we used SDSS/DR12 data to derive photo-z estimates for the

as much as 170 new candidates across the entire field. The spatial distribution
of these galaxies may suggest an overlap between the systems with no evidence

fingerprinting in the context of Deep Learning (DL). Remarkable progress has
been made in the area of deep learning. Sharing the trained DL models has
become a trend that is ubiquitous in various fields ranging from biomedical
diagnosis to stock prediction. As the availability and popularity of
pre-trained models are increasing, it is critical to protect the Intellectual
Property (IP) of the model owner. DeepMarks introduces the first fingerprinting
methodology that enables the model owner to embed unique fingerprints within
the parameters (weights) of her model and later identify undesired usages of
her distributed models. The proposed framework embeds the fingerprints in the
Probability Density Function (pdf) of trainable weights by leveraging the extra
capacity available in contemporary DL models. DeepMarks is robust against
fingerprints collusion as well as network transformation attacks, including
model compression and model fine-tuning. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations
on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, as well as a wide variety of deep neural
networks architectures such as Wide Residual Networks (WRNs) and Convolutional

curvature and discuss its consequences on cosmological dynamics. To figure this
out, a polynomial $f(T)$ model and a double torsion model are considered. We
first analyze those models with cosmic data, employing the recent surveys of
Union 2.1, baryonic acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background
measurements. We then emphasize that the two popular $f(T)$ models enable the
crossing of the phantom divide line due to dark torsion. Afterwards, we compute
numerical bounds up to 3-$\sigma$ confidence level, emphasizing the fact that
$\Omega_{k0}$ turns out to be non-compatible with zero at least at 1$\sigma$.
Moreover, we underline that, even increasing the accuracy, one cannot remove
the degeneracy between our models and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. So that, we
show that our treatments contain the concordance paradigm and we analyze the
equation of state behaviors at different redshift domains. We also take into
account gamma ray bursts and we describe the evolution of both the $f(T)$
models with high redshift data. We calibrate the gamma ray burst measurements
through small redshift surveys of data and we thus compare the main differences
between non-flat and flat $f(T)$ cosmology at different redshift ranges. We
finally match the corresponding outcomes with small redshift bounds provided by
cosmography. To do so, we analyze the deceleration parameters and their
variations, proportional to the jerk term. Even though the two models well fit
late-time data, we notice that the polynomial $f(T)$ approach provides an
effective de-Sitter phase, whereas the second $f(T)$ framework shows analogous
results compared with the $\Lambda$CDM predictions.

effects, difference in beam sizes among frequency bands, and Doppler shift due

reported as evidence for an IMBH in previous studies are confirmed in the
re-analyzed ALMA images. Instead, through analysis of the position--velocity
structure of the HCN J=3-2 data cube, we have found kinematics typical of a
cloud-cloud collision (CCC), namely, two distinct velocity components bridged
by broad emission features with elevated temperatures and/or densities. One
velocity component has a straight filamentary shape with approximately constant
centroid velocities along its length but with a steep, V-shaped velocity
gradient across its width. This contradicts the IMBH scenario but is consistent
with a collision between two dissimilar-sized clouds. From a non-LTE analysis
of the multi-transition methanol lines, the volume density of the post-shock
gas has been measured to be $\gtrsim 10^6\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, indicating that
the CCC shock can compress gas in a short timescale to densities typical of
star-forming regions. Evidence for star formation has not been found, possibly
because the cloud is in an early phase of CCC-triggered star formation or
because the collision is non-productive.

about its material properties (e.g. mean density), but also its symmetries.
Spherical symmetry can be broken by rotation and/or magnetic fields. It has
been postulated that strong magnetic fields in the cores of some red giants are
responsible for their anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes (the ""dipole
dichotomy"" problem), but a detailed understanding of how gravity waves interact
with strong fields is thus far lacking. In this work, we attack the problem
through a variety of analytical and numerical techniques, applied to a
localised region centred on a null line of a confined axisymmetric magnetic
field which is approximated as being cylindrically symmetric. We uncover a rich
variety of phenomena that manifest when the field strength exceeds a critical
value, beyond which the symmetry is drastically broken by the Lorentz force.
When this threshold is reached, the spatial structure of the g-modes becomes
heavily altered. The dynamics of wave packet propagation transitions from
regular to chaotic, which is expected to fundamentally change the organisation
of the mode spectrum. In addition, depending on their frequency and the
orientation of field lines with respect to the stratification, waves impinging
on different parts of the magnetised region are found to undergo either
reflection or trapping. Trapping regions provide an avenue for energy loss
through Alfven wave phase mixing. Our results may find application in various
astrophysical contexts, including the dipole dichotomy problem, the solar
interior, and compact star oscillations.

prominent blue bump in the $U$, $B$ and $g$ bands lasting for $\sim$5 d. One
interpretation of the early light curve was that the excess blue light was due
to shocking of the SN ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star -- a
signature of the single degenerate scenario. If this is the correct
interpretation, the interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star
could result in significant H$\alpha$ (or helium) emission at late times,
possibly along with other species, depending on the companion star and its
orbital separation. A search for H$\alpha$ emission in our +302 d spectrum
yields a nondetection, with a $L_{H\alpha}$$<$8.0$\times$10$^{35}$ erg/s (given
an assumed distance of $D$=12.3 Mpc), which we have verified by implanting
simulated H$\alpha$ emission into our data. We make a quantitative comparison
to models of swept-up material stripped from a nondegenerate companion star,

Roche lobe overflow as the progenitor of SN 2017cbv. Alternatively, there could
be weaknesses in the envelope-stripping and radiative transfer models necessary

the neutrino mass and the dark energy equation of state. Nevertheless it
remains an open question of how to optimally extract the information and how
well the matter power spectrum must be known to obtain unbiased cosmological
parameter estimates. By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we
quantify the sensitivity of 3D cosmic shear and tomography with different
binning strategies to different regions of the lensing kernel and matter power
spectrum, and hence the background geometry and growth of structure in the
Universe. We find that a large number of equally spaced tomographic bins in
redshift can extract nearly all the cosmological information without the
additional computational expense of 3D cosmic shear. Meanwhile a large fraction
of the information comes from small poorly understood scales in the matter
power spectrum, that can lead to biases on measurements of cosmological
parameters. In light of this, we define and compute a cosmology-independent
measure of the bias due to imperfect knowledge of the power spectrum. For a
Euclid-like survey, we find that the power spectrum must be known to an
accuracy of less than 1% on scales with k = 7 h /Mpc This requirement is not
absolute since the bias depends on the magnitude of modelling errors, where
they occur in k-z space, and the correlation between them, all of which are
specific to any particular model. We therefore compute the bias in several of
the most likely modelling scenarios and introduce a general formalism and
public code, RequiSim, to compute the expected bias from any non-linear model.

measured using the Heidelberg Emission Line Algorithm (HELA), which compares

we determine that HELA reliably recovers input S$_{0.5}$ and angular momentum
at small offsets, but $V_{2.2}/\sigma_g$ values are offset and highly
scattered. We examine the role of regular and irregular morphology in the
stellar mass kinematic scaling relations, deriving the kinematic measurement
S$_{0.5}$, and finding $\log(S_{0.5}) = (0.38\pm0.07)\log(M/M_{\odot}-10) +

similar levels of scatter ($\sim0.16$ dex). Additionally, we identify a
correlation between M$_{\star}$ and $V_{2.2}/\sigma_g$ for the total sample,
showing an increasing level of rotation dominance with increasing M$_{\star}$,
and a high level of scatter for both regular and irregular galaxies. We
estimate the specific angular momenta ($j_{disk}$) of these galaxies and find a
slope of $0.36\pm0.12$, shallower than predicted without mass-dependent disk
growth, but this result is possibly due to measurement uncertainty at
M$_{\star}$ $<$ 9.5. However, through a K-S test we find irregular galaxies to
have marginally higher $j_{disk}$ values than regular galaxies, and high
scatter at low masses in both populations.

analysed the resulting velocity distributions in Solar neighbourhood-like
volumes, and have performed statistical tests for the presence of kinematic
substructures. Furthermore, we have characterized the particles' orbits using a
Fourier analysis. The local velocity distributions obtained are relatively
smooth, statistically consistent with being devoid of substructures even for a
dark halo potential with significant but plausible triaxiality. Although
resonances are indeed present and associated with specific regions of velocity
space, the fraction of stars associated to these is relatively minor. The most
significant imprint of the triaxiality of the dark halo is in fact, a variation

accurate determination of their masses. However, inferring the relationship
between cluster mass and observables from direct observations is difficult and
prone to sample selection biases. In this work, we use weak lensing as the best
possible proxy for cluster mass to calibrate the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect
measurements from the APEX-SZ experiment. For a well-defined (ROSAT) X-ray
complete cluster sample, we calibrate the integrated Comptonization parameter,
$Y_{\rm SZ}$, to the weak-lensing derived total cluster mass, $M_{500}$. We
employ a novel Bayesian approach to account for the selection effects by
jointly fitting both the SZ Comptonization, $Y_{\rm SZ}\text{--}M_{500}$, and
the X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm x}\text{--}M_{500}$, scaling relations. We also
account for a possible correlation between the intrinsic (log-normal) scatter
of $L_{\rm x}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ at fixed mass. We find the corresponding
correlation coefficient to be $r= 0.47_{-0.35}^{+0.24}$, and at the current
precision level our constraints on the scaling relations are consistent with
previous works. For our APEX-SZ sample, we find that ignoring the covariance
between the SZ and X-ray observables biases the normalization of the $Y_{\rm
SZ}\text{--}M_{500}$ scaling high by $1\text{--}2\sigma$ and the slope low by
$\sim 1\sigma$, even when the SZ effect plays no role in the sample selection.
We conclude that for higher-precision data and larger cluster samples, as
anticipated from on-going and near-future cluster cosmology experiments,
similar biases (due to intrinsic covariances of cluster observables) in the
scaling relations will dominate the cosmological error budget if not accounted
for correctly.

galaxies, we performed a series of 39 gas dynamical simulations of isolated
barred and unbarred galaxies with various masses, initial gas fractions, and
AGN feedback models. The presence of a bar drives a substantial amount of gas
toward the central region of the galaxy. In the most massive galaxies, this
results in a violent starburst, followed by a drop in star formation resulting
from gas exhaustion. The time delay between Type Ia and Type II supernovae
explosions means that barred galaxies experience a rapid increase in [O/H] in
the central region, and a much more gradual increase in [Fe/H]. In unbarred
galaxies, star formation proceeds at a slow and steady rate, and oxygen and
iron are produced at steady rates which are similar except for a time offset.
Comparing the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies with the same
central stellar mass $M_*$, we find in barred galaxies an enhancement of 0.07
dex in [O/H], 0.05 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.05 dex in [O/Fe]. The [O/H] enhancement
is in excellent agreement with observations from the SDSS. The initial gas
fraction has very little effect on the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred
galaxies, unless the galaxies experience a starburst. We considered AGN-host
galaxies located near the bottom of the AGN regime,
$M_*>3\times10^{10}M_\odot$, where AGN feedback dominates over supernovae
feedback. We found that the impact of AGN feedback on the central abundances is
marginal.

inference methods based on moment inequalities. Commonly used confidence sets
for parameters are level sets of criterion functions whose boundary points may
depend on sample moments in an irregular manner. Due to this feature,
simulation errors can affect the performance of inference in non-standard ways.
In particular, a (first-order) bias due to the simulation errors may remain in
the estimated boundary of the confidence set. We demonstrate, through Monte
Carlo experiments, that simulation errors can significantly reduce the coverage
probabilities of confidence sets in small samples. The size distortion is
particularly severe when the number of inequality restrictions is large. These
results highlight the danger of ignoring the sampling variations due to the
simulation errors in moment inequality models. Similar issues arise when using
predicted variables in moment inequalities models. We propose a method for
properly correcting for these variations based on regularizing the intersection
of moments in parameter space, and we show that our proposed method performs
well theoretically and in practice.

introduce pairwise adversarial supervision to constrain two-way domain
adaptation by a small number of paired real and synthetic images for training
along with the large volume of unpaired data. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments are performed to validate our idea. Generated face
images of new identities contain pose, lighting and expression diversity and
qualitative results show that they are highly constraint by the synthetic input

face images generated by the proposed method with the real data set to train
face recognition algorithms. We evaluated the model on two challenging data

planets (CBPs) via coupled stellar-tidal evolution of isolated binary stars.
Tidal forces between low-mass, short-period binary stars on the pre-main
sequence slow the stellar rotations, transferring rotational angular momentum
to the orbit as the stars approach the tidally locked state. This transfer
increases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical
instability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to
preferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After
the stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic
braking can significantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of
dynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed
relative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter
space and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most
plausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major
axis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable
consequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running
N-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and find that typically,
at least one planet is ejected from the system. We apply our theory to the
shortest period {\it Kepler} binary that possesses a CBP, Kepler-47, and find
that its existence is consistent with our model. Under conservative
assumptions, we find that coupled stellar-tidal evolution of pre-main sequence
binary stars removes at least one close-in CBP in $87\%$ of multi-planet
circumbinary systems.

of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to the merger of compact object binaries composed by
two neutron stars (NSs) or by a NS and a black hole (BH). The recent
observation of the binary NS (BNS) merger event GW170817 associated with GRB
170817A brought a great deal of additional information and provided further
support to the above connection, even though the identification of this burst
as a canonical short GRB (SGRB) remains uncertain. Decades of observational
constraints and theoretical models consolidated the idea of a jet origin for
the GRB prompt emission, which can also explain the multiwavelength afterglow
radiation observed in most of the events. However, the mechanisms through which
a BNS or NS-BH merger remnant would power a collimated outflow are much less
constrained. Understanding the properties of the remnant systems and whether
they can provide the right conditions for jet production has been a main driver
of the great effort devoted to study BNS and NS-BH mergers, and still
represents a real challenge from both the physical and the computational point
of view. One fundamental open question concerns the nature of the central
engine itself. While the leading candidate system is a BH surrounded by a
massive accretion disk, the recent observation of plateau-shaped X-ray
afterglows in some SGRBs would suggest a longer-lived engine, i.e. a metastable
(or even stable) massive NS, which would also exclude NS-BH progenitors. Here
we elaborate on this key aspect, considering three different scenarios to
explain the SGRB phenomenology based on different hypotheses on the nature of
the merger remnant. Then, we discuss the basic properties of GRB 170817A and
how this event would fit within the different frameworks of the above
scenarios, under the assumption that it was or was not a canonical SGRB.

coefficients, we compare our results, in a qualitative manner, to recent
observations {at energies of 55 -- 105 keV}, focusing on the longitudinal
distribution of the peak intensity, the maximum anisotropy and the onset time.
By using transport coefficients which are derived from first principles, we
limit the number of free parameters in the model to: (i) the probability of
SEPs following diffusing magnetic field lines, quantified by $a \in [0,1]$, and
(ii) the broadness of the Gaussian injection function. It is found that the
model solutions are extremely sensitive to the magnitude of the {perpendicular}
diffusion coefficient and relatively insensitive to the form of the injection
function as long as a reasonable value of $a=0.2$ is used. We illustrate the
effects of perpendicular diffusion on the model solutions and discuss the
viability of this process as a dominant mechanism by which SEPs are transported
in longitude. Lastly, we try to quantity the effectiveness of perpendicular
diffusion as an interplay between the magnitude of the relevant diffusion
coefficient and the SEP intensity gradient driving the diffusion process. It
follows that perpendicular diffusion is extremely effective early in a SEP
event when large intensity gradients are present, while the effectiveness
quickly decreases with time thereafter.

holes' nearly extremal spins is challenging. When the spins are nearly extremal

that are large, though the recovered spin magnitudes are still significantly
smaller than the true spin magnitudes. When the spins are nearly extremal and
antiparallel to each other, the resulting parameter estimates recover the small

reported as one of the most complex continental earthquakes ever documented1,
which resulted in a distinctive on and off-fault deformation pattern. Previous
geophysical studies confirm that the rupture globally propagated northward from
epicenter. However, the exact rupture- propagation path is still not well
understood because of the geometrical complexity, partly at sea, and the
possibility of a blind thrust. Here we use a combination of state-of- the-art
observation of surface deformation, provided by optical image correlation, and
first principle physics-based numerical modeling to determine the most likely

deformation and identify specific off-fault damage zones in the area of the
triple junction between the Jordan, the Kekerengu and the Papatea fault
segments. We also model dynamic rupture propagation, including the activation

triple junction. Comparing our observations with the results from the above two
modeled scenarios we show that only one of the scenarios best explains both the

analytically tractable description of the physical mechanism of the first order
liquid-gel phase transition. We demonstrate that liquid-gel phase transition is
cooperative effect of the three major interactions: inter-lipid van der Waals
attraction, steric repulsion and hydrophobic tension. The model explicitly
shows that temperature-dependent inter-lipid steric repulsion switches the
system from liquid to gel phase when the temperature decreases. The switching
manifests itself in the increase of lateral compressibility of the lipids as
the temperature decreases, making phase with smaller area more preferable below
the transition temperature. The model gives qualitatively correct picture of
abrupt change at transition temperature of the area per lipid, membrane
thickness and volume per hydrocarbon group in the lipid chains. The calculated
dependence of phase transition temperature on lipid chain length is in
quantitative agreement with experimental data. Steric repulsion between the
lipid molecules is shown to be the only driver of the phase transition, as van
der Waals attraction and hydrophobic tension are weakly temperature dependent.

structures are also compared and luminosity- and mass-weighted profiles are
derived. We use MUFFIT to process the J-PLUS observations, and two different
techniques (STARLIGHT and STECKMAP) to analyze IFU CALIFA data. We demonstrate
that this novel technique delivers radial stellar population gradients in good
agreement with the IFU technique CALIFA/STECKMAP although comparison of the
absolute values reveals the existence of intrinsic systematic differences.
Radial stellar population gradients differ when CALIFA/STARLIGHT methodology is
used. Age and metallicity radial profiles derived from J-PLUS/MUFFIT are very
similar when luminosity- or mass-weighted properties are used, suggesting that
the contribution of a younger component is small. Comparison between the three
methodologies reveals some discrepancies suggesting that the specific
characteristics of each method causes important differences. We conclude that
the ages, metallicities and extinction derived for individual galaxies not only
depend on the chosen models but also depend on the method used.

information on the random force exerted by the beam on chemically-relevant time
scales. Using stochastic reconstruction of molecular dynamic simulations, we
recover the potential energy landscape of the atom and use it to determine the
beam-induced effects in the thermal (i.e. white noise) approximation. We
further demonstrate that the moving atom under beam excitation can be used to
map potential energy along step edges, providing information about atomic-scale
potentials in solids. These studies open the pathway for quantitative studies
of beam-induced atomic dynamics, elementary mechanisms of solid-state
transformations, and predictive atom-by-atom fabrication.

enforce the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) on a moving grid for an Arbitrary
Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the Euler equations discretized in
time for either the Non Linear Frequency Domain (NLFD) or Time-Spectral (TS)
methods. The equations are spatially discretized by a structured finite-volume
scheme on a hexahedral mesh. The derived methodologies follow a general
approach where the positions and the velocities of the grid points are known at
each time step. The integrated face mesh velocities are derived either from the
Approximation of the Exact Volumetric Increments (AEVI) relative to the
undeformed mesh or exactly computed based on a Trilinear Mapping (TRI-MAP)
between the physical space and the computational domain. The accuracy of the
AEVI method highly depends on the computation of the volumetric increments and
limits the temporal-order of accuracy of the deduced integrated face mesh
velocities to between one and two. Thus defeating the purpose of the NLFD
method which possesses spectral rate of convergence. However, the TRI-MAP
method has proven to be more computationally efficient, ensuring the
satisfaction of the GCL once the convergence of the time derivative of the cell
volume is reached in Fourier space. The methods are validated numerically by
verifying the conservation of uniform flow and by comparing the integrated face
mesh velocities to the exact values derived from the mapping.

Consequently, some of the funding program's impact on science is squandered
because applying researchers must spend time writing proposals instead of doing

preparation negate the scientific impact of the funding program? Are there
alternative mechanisms for awarding funds that advance science more
efficiently? We use the economic theory of contests to analyze how efficiently
grant proposal competitions advance science, and compare them with recently
proposed, partially randomized alternatives such as lotteries. We find that the
effort researchers waste in writing proposals may be comparable to the total
scientific value of the research that the funding supports, especially when
only a few proposals can be funded. Moreover, when professional pressures
motivate investigators to seek funding for reasons that extend beyond the value
of the proposed science (e.g., promotion, prestige), the entire program can
actually hamper scientific progress when the number of awards is small. We
suggest that lost efficiency may be restored either by partial lotteries for

in detail. A realistic tight binding model, fit to ab initio calculations,
accounts for the Li-decoration of graphene with broken lattice symmetry, and
includes $s$ and $d$ symmetry Bloch character that influences the gap
symmetries that can arise. The resulting seven hybridized Li-C orbitals that
support nine possible bond pairing amplitudes. The gap equation is solved for
all possible gap symmetries. One band is weakly dispersive near the Fermi
energy along $\Gamma\rightarrow M$ where its Bloch wave function has linear
combination of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ character, and is responsible for $
d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and $d_{xy}$ pairing with lowest pairing energy in our model.
These symmetries almost preserve properties from a two band model of pristine

degenerate with upper $s$ band that favors extended $s$ wave pairing which is
not found in two band model. Upon electron doping to a critical chemical

dynamics mutually influence each other. By contrast, that has been extensively
studied in the case of individuals. Over decades, the French sociologist Pierre
Bourdieu showed that people's success and their positions in society mainly
depend on how much they can spend (their economic capital) and what their
interests are (their cultural capital). For the first time, we adapt Bourdieu's
framework to the city context. We operationalize a neighborhood's cultural
capital in terms of the cultural interests that pictures geo-referenced in the
neighborhood tend to express. This is made possible by the mining of what users
of the photo-sharing site of Flickr have posted in the cities of London and New
York over 5 years. In so doing, we are able to show that economic capital alone
does not explain urban development. The combination of cultural capital and
economic capital, instead, is more indicative of neighborhood growth in terms
of house prices and improvements of socio-economic conditions. Culture pays,
but only up to a point as it comes with one of the most vexing urban
challenges: that of gentrification.

increasing the effective collection area of SiPMs through the shifting and
trapping of scintillation light in noble liquids, thus with great potential for
improving timing and calorimetry resolution in neutrino and dark matter search
experiments using time projection chambers. It is expected to achieve a single
photon detection efficiency larger than 1\%. The initial design consists of a
box made of highly reflective internal surface material and with an acceptance
window for photons composed of two shifters and a dichroic filter. The first
shifter converts liquid argon scintillation VUV light to a photon of wavelength
smaller than the dichroic cutoff, so the surface is highly transparent to it.
When passing through the dichroic filter, it reaches the second shifter which
allows the photon to be shifted to the visible region and be detected by the
SiPM nested inside it. When it enters the box, the photon will likely reflect a
few times, including on the dichroic filter surface, before being detected. We
present a full numerical description of the device using a Monte Carlo
framework, including characterization of the acceptance window, models of
reflection of different materials, and sensor quantum efficiency, that can now
be used to further improve the detection efficiency by comparing different
geometries, positions of SiPM and materials. Estimates of simulated
efficiencies, number of reflections and acquisition time are presented and
compared to analytical calculations. Those are very promising results, giving a
total efficiency for the detection of scintillation light in liquid argon of
1.7$\rm \pm$0.3\%. Comparison of the estimated total efficiency with a

framework falls under the umbrella of active learning (AL), a class of
algorithms that aims to minimize labelling costs by identifying a few,
carefully chosen, objects which have high potential in improving the classifier
predictions. As a proof of concept, we use the simulated data released after
the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPCC) and a random forest
classifier. Our results show that, using only 12\% the number of training
objects in the SNPCC spectroscopic sample, this approach is able to double
purity results. Moreover, in order to take into account multiple spectroscopic
observations in the same night, we propose a semi-supervised batch-mode AL
algorithm which selects a set of $N=5$ most informative objects at each night.
In comparison with the initial state using the traditional approach, our method
achieves 2.3 times higher purity and comparable figure of merit results after
only 180 days of observation, or 800 queries (73% of the SNPCC spectroscopic
sample size). Such results were obtained using the same amount of spectroscopic
time necessary to observe the original SNPCC spectroscopic sample, showing that
this type of strategy is feasible with current available spectroscopic
resources. The code used in this work is available in the COINtoolbox:

uncovered that the Fermi surface nesting becomes perfect, where the dynamics of
hot electrons is dispersionless along the orthogonal direction of the nesting
wave-vector. In addition, scanning tunneling microscopy measurements confirmed
that the resulting CDW state shows essentially the same modulation pattern as
the three dimensional system of $VSe_{2}$. Here, we perform the renormalization
group analysis based on an effective field theory in terms of critical CDW
fluctuations and hot electrons of imperfect Fermi-surface nesting. As a result,
we reveal that the imperfect nesting universally flows into perfect nesting in
two dimensions, where the Fermi velocity along the orthogonal direction of the
nesting vector vanishes generically. We argue that this electronic
reconstruction is responsible for the observation that the CDW transition
temperature is much more enhanced to be around $T_{c} > 300$ $K$ than that of
the bulk sample.

$hd(\pi, \sigma) = |\{ x\in \Omega: \pi(x) \ne \sigma(x) \}|$, called the
Hamming distance between $\pi$ and $\sigma$. Now let $hd(A) =$ min$\{ hd(\pi,
\sigma): \pi, \sigma \in A \}$. For positive integers $n$ and $d$ with $d\le
n$, we let $M(n,d)$ be the maximum number of permutations in any array $A$
satisfying $hd(A) \geq d$. There is an extensive literature on the function
$M(n,d)$, motivated in part by suggested applications to error correcting codes
for message transmission over power lines.
  A basic fact is that if a permutation group $G$ is sharply $k$-transitive on
a set of size $n\geq k$, then $M(n,n-k+1) = |G|$. Motivated by this we consider
the permutation groups $AGL(1,q)$ and $PGL(2,q)$ acting sharply
$2$-transitively on $GF(q)$ and sharply $3$-transitively on $GF(q)\cup
\{\infty\}$ respectively. Applying a contraction operation to these groups, we
obtain the following new lower bounds for prime powers $q$ satisfying $q\equiv
1$ (mod $3$).
  1. $M(q-1,q-3)\geq (q^{2} - 1)/2$ for $q$ odd, $q\geq 7$,
  2. $M(q-1,q-3)\geq (q-1)(q+2)/3$ for $q$ even, $q\geq 8$,
  3. $M(q,q-3)\geq Kq^{2}\log q$ for some constant $K$ if $q$ is odd, $q\geq
13$.
  These results resolve a case left open in a previous paper \cite{BLS}, where
it was shown that $M(q-1, q-3) \geq q^{2} - q$ and $M(q,q-3) \geq q^{3} - q$
for all prime powers $q$ such that $q\not \equiv 1$ (mod $3$). We also obtain
lower bounds for $M(n,d)$ for a finite number of exceptional pairs $n,d$, by
applying this contraction operation to the sharply $4$ and $5$-transitive
Mathieu groups.

  under ""Ancillary files""",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the nature of the glass transition by cooling model atomistic glass
formers at constant rate from a temperature above the onset of glassy dynamics
to $T=0$. Motivated by the East model, a kinetically constrained lattice model
with hierarchical relaxation, we make several predictions about the behavior of
the supercooled liquid as it passes through the glass transition. We then
compare those predictions to the results of our atomistic simulations.
Consistent with our predictions, our results show that the relaxation time
$\tau$ of the material undergoes a crossover from super-Arrhenius to Arrhenius
behavior at a cooling-rate-dependent glass transition temperature $T_\text{g}$.
The slope of $\ln\tau$ with respect to inverse temperature exhibits a peak near
$T_\text{g}$ that grows more pronounced with slower cooling, matching our
expectations qualitatively. Additionally, the limiting value of this slope at
low temperature shows remarkable quantitative agreement with our predictions.
Our results also show that the rate of short-time particle displacements
deviates from the equilibrium linear scaling around $T_\text{g}$,
asymptotically approaching a different linear scaling. To our surprise, these
short-time displacements, the dynamic indicators of the underlying excitations
responsible for structural relaxation, show no spatial correlations beyond a
few particle diameters, both above and below $T_\text{g}$. This final result is
contrary to our expectation, based on previous results for East model glasses
formed by cooling, that inter-excitation correlations should emerge as the
liquid vitrifies.

Ti, V, Cr, while it is antiferromagnetic for TM = Mn. All the ferromagnetic

Model (3DMM) is widely used in facial analysis, e.g., model fitting, image
synthesis. Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face
images with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis
functions. Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as the linear
bases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited. To address these
problems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM
model from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face
scans. Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates
the projection, shape and texture parameters. Two decoders serve as the
nonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and texture parameters to the 3D shape and
texture, respectively. With the projection parameter, 3D shape, and texture, a
novel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct
the original input face. The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only
weak supervision. We demonstrate the superior representation power of our
nonlinear 3DMM over its linear counterpart, and its contribution to face
alignment and 3D reconstruction.

through a multi-scale generalized plane matching approach. In our method, we
regard the scene as a collection of planes at multiple scales, and for each
such plane, compensate motion in consensus to improve match quality. We
estimate the square patch plane distortion using a robust plane model detection
method and iteratively apply a plane matching scheme within a multi-scale
framework. During the flow estimation process, our enhanced plane matching
method also clearly localizes the occluded regions. In experiments on
MPI-Sintel datasets, our method robustly estimated optical flow from given
noisy correspondences, and also revealed the occluded regions accurately.
Compared to other state-of-the-art optical flow methods, our method shows
accurate occlusion localization, comparable optical flow quality, and better

an unsupervised paradigm for deep visual odometry learning. We show that using
a noisy teacher, which could be a standard VO pipeline, and by designing a loss

accurate deep models for VO that do not require ground-truth labels. We
leverage geometry as a self-supervisory signal and propose ""Composite

also present a method of characterizing the uncertainty in VO estimates thus
obtained. To evaluate our VO pipeline, we present exhaustive ablation studies

high-dimensional and have complex cross-correlation structure. The complexity
of data structure can be observed as that (1) some functions are strongly
correlated with similar features, while some others may have almost no
cross-correlations with quite diverse features; and (2) the cross-correlation
structure may also change over time due to the system evolution. With this
regard, this paper presents a dynamic subspace learning method for multivariate
functional data modeling. In particular, we consider different functions come
from different subspaces, and only functions of the same subspace have
cross-correlations with each other. The subspaces can be automatically
formulated and learned by reformatting the problem as a sparse regression. By
allowing but regularizing the regression change over time, we can describe the
cross-correlation dynamics. The model can be efficiently estimated by the fast
iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA), and the features of every
subspace can be extracted using the smooth multi-channel functional PCA.
Numerical studies together with case studies demonstrate the efficiency and

transferring data and keeping records, which is widely practiced. However, due
to the analog signal interference between the pixel grids of the display screen

captured screen images. As the moir\'e patterns are structured and highly

convolutional neural network for demoir\'eing screen photos. The proposed DCNN
consists of a coarse-scale network and a fine-scale network. In the
coarse-scale network, the input image is first downsampled and then processed
by stacked residual blocks to remove the moir\'e artifacts. After that, the
fine-scale network upsamples the demoir\'ed low-resolution image back to the
original resolution. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the
proposed technique can efficiently remove the moir\'e patterns for camera
acquired screen images; the new technique outperforms the existing ones.

outstanding puzzle in correlated superconductors. The observation and tuning of
the hidden QCP, which is critical in resolving the mystery, however, has been
rarely reported due to lack of ideal systems. The helical antiferromagnet CrAs
provides an example in which a dome of superconductivity appears at a pressure
where its magnetic transition goes to zero temperature. Here we report the
tuning of a projected critical point in CrAs via Al chemical doping (Al-CrAs)
and separation of the magnetic critical point from the pressure-induced
superconducting phase. When CrAs is doped with Al, its AFM ordering temperature
TN increases from 260 K to 270 K. With applied pressure, TN decreases and
extrapolates to zero Kelvin near 4.5 kbar, which is shifted from 8 kbar for
undoped CrAs. A funnel of anomalously enhanced electron scattering and a
non-Fermi liquid resistivity underscore an AFM QCP near 4.5 kbar in Al-CrAs.
Pressure-induced superconductivity, in contrast, is almost independent of Al
doping and forms a dome with essentially the identical maximum Tc and same
optimal pressure as in pure CrAs. The clear separation between the tuned AFM
QCP and Tc maximum in Al-CrAs suggests that superconductivity is independent of
the AFM QCP, illustrating subtleties in the interplay between superconductivity
and quantum criticality in correlated electron systems.

an alternative to today's IP-based Internet Architecture. Instead of focusing
on hosts and their locations, CCN emphasizes addressable named content. By
decoupling content from its location, CCN allows opportunistic in-network
content caching, thus enabling better network utilization, at least for
scalable content distribution. However, in order to be considered seriously,
CCN must support basic security services, including content authenticity,
integrity, confidentiality, authorization and access control. Current
approaches rely on content producers to perform authorization and access
control. This general approach has several disadvantages. First, consumer
privacy vis-a-vis producers is not preserved. Second, identity management and
access control impose high computational overhead on producers. Also,
unnecessary repeated authentication and access control decisions must be made
for each content request.
  These issues motivate our design of KRB-CCN - a complete authorization and
access control system for private CCNs. Inspired by Kerberos in IP-based
networks, KRB-CCN involves distinct authentication and authorization
authorities. By doing so, KRB-CCN obviates the need for producers to make
consumer authentication and access control decisions. KRB-CCN preserves
consumer privacy since producers are unaware of consumer identities. Producers
are also not required to keep any hard state and only need to perform two
symmetric key operations to guarantee that sensitive content is confidentially
delivered only to authenticated and authorized consumers. Most importantly,
unlike prior designs, KRB-CCN leaves the network (i.e., CCN routers) out of any
authorization, access control or confidentiality issues. We describe KRB-CCN
design and implementation, analyze its security, and report on its performance.

the main parameters are the Schwarzschild radius RS, the rotation term a, and
the charged term RQ. From the calculations, the averagely radial speed of light
from r=Rs to r= (alpha)Rs with alpha>1 is possibly exceeding the speed of light
c in free space by an observer in a reference frame far away from the black

of the black hole is very high or the charge is large enough. This averagely
radial speed finally goes to c in a large distance away from the black hole. We

that this encoding emerges during the embodied learning process when the
appropriate action is selected to minimize the prediction error in perception.
Therefore, this predictive stream in the sensorimotor loop is generated in a
top-down manner. Specifically, it is constantly modulated by the motor actions
and is updated by the bottom-up prediction error signals. In this way, the
top-down prediction originally comes from the prior experience from both
perception and action representing the higher levels of this hierarchical
cognition. In our proposed embodied model, we extend the PredNet Network, a
hierarchical predictive coding network, with the motor action units implemented
by a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to modulate the network top-down

distortion theory -- a branch of information theory that deals with lossy data
compression. We find that as the cost of unit information goes down, the system
undergoes a sequence of transitions, corresponding to the recruitment of an
increasing number of responses, thus improving response specificity as well as
the net payoff. We derive formal equations for the transition points and
exactly solve them for special cases. The first transition point, also called
the {\it coding transition}, demarcates the boundary between a passive response
and an active decision-making by the system. We study this transition point in
detail, and derive three classes of asymptotic behavior, corresponding to the
three limiting distributions of the statistics of extreme values. Our work
points to the necessity of a union between information theory and the theory of
adaptive biomolecular networks, in particular metabolic networks.

be used as filters for feature extraction. In the second phase, we apply
conventional k-means to the representations extracted by the centroids and then
project cluster labels to the target images. We evaluated our methods on

out over four orbital cycles in order to search for orbital modulation,
covering the entire orbital phase. We have measured radial velocity of
H$\alpha$ emission line with the method introduced by Shafter et al. (1986),
which has been successfully applied to some Be stars. The velocity is seen to
increase much earlier than expected for the orbital period of 315 days, and
much more steeply than expected at around ""apastron"". The period of the
H$\alpha$ modulation is found to be as $308^{+26}_{-23}$ days. We have also
analyzed Swift/XRT data from 2009 to 2015 to study the orbital modulation,
selecting the data with good statistics ($\geq$ 30 counts). With additional
two-year data to the previous works, the orbital period has been updated to
$313^{+11}_{-8}$ days, which is consistent with the previous X-ray periods and
the spectroscopic one. The past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations prefer the
period of 313 days. With the new period, assuming that H$\alpha$ velocities
accurately trace the motion of the Be star, we have derived a new set of the
orbital parameters. In the new orbit, which is less eccentric ($e \sim 0.6$),
two outbursts occur after apastron, and just after periastron. Besides, the
column density in bright phase
($4.7^{+0.9}_{-08}\times10^{21}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) is higher than in faint
phase ($2.2\pm0.5\times10^{21}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$). These facts suggest that
outbursts occur when the compact object passes nearby/through the Be disk. The
mass function implies that mass of the compact object is less than 2.5
$\mathrm{M_{sun}}$ assuming that the mass of the Be star is 13.2--18.2
$\mathrm{M_{sun}}$ (Aragona at al. 2010) unless the inclination is extremely
small. The photon index indicates that the spectra becomes softer when the
system is bright. These suggest that the compact object is a pulsar.

research interest due to its ability to enhance the overall spectral efficiency
of wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate the pairwise error
probability (PEP) performance of conventional NOMA systems, where an exact
closed form expression for the PEP is derived for different users, to give some
insight about the reliability of the far and near users. Through the derivation
of PEP expressions, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable diversity order
is proportional to the user's order. The obtained error probability expressions
are used to formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the overall bit
error rate (BER) under power and error rate threshold constrains. The derived
analytical results, corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations, are presented to
show the diversity order and error rate performance of each individual user.

unstable dark matter are fitted to the experimental data. Since no significant
excess is observed in either analysis, lower limits on the lifetime of dark

allows the computation of the (1) field-dressed rovibronic states induced by a
medium intensity continuous-wave laser light and the (2) transition amplitudes
between these field-dressed states with respect to an additional weak probe
pulse. The field-dressed spectrum features ab- sorption peaks resembling the
field-free spectrum as well as stimulated emission peaks corresponding to
transitions not visible in the field-free case. By investigating the dependence
of the field-dressed spectra on the dressing-field wavelength, both in full-
and reduced dimensional simulations, direct signatures of the LICI can be
identified. These signatures include (1) the appearance of new peaks and the
splitting of peaks for both absorption and stimulated emission, and (2) the
manifestation of an intensity borrowing effect in the field-dressed spectrum.

identification --what the device is, and, authentication --is the device the
one it claims to be. Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by
means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of
cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management,
render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for
IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly
neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both
these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform
device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type
identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from
the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine
learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our
approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of
86-99% and a mean accuracy of 99%, across all our experiments. Our approach is
successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we
show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e.,
identifying different device types having similar functionality.

that $\lambda\upsilon$ is an intrinsically non-strict calculus of explicit
substitutions. Finally, we investigate the distribution of various redexes
governing the substitution resolution in $\lambda\upsilon$ and investigate the
quantitative contribution of various substitution primitives.

results. The extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed

occurring during the temporal evolution of a quenched transverse field Ising
chain coupled to a particle loss type of bath (local in Jordan-Wigner fermion
space) using two versions of the Loschmidt overlap (LO), namely, the fidelity
induced LO and the interferometric phase induced LO. The bath, on the one hand,
dictates the dissipative evolution following a sudden quench and on the other,
plays a role in dissipative mixed state preparation in the later part of the
study. During a dissipative evolution following a sudden quench, no trace of
DQPTs are revealed in both the fidelity and the interferometric phase
approaches; however, remarkably the interferometric phase approach reveals the
possibility of inter-steady state DQPTs in passage from one steady state to the
other when the system is subjected to a quench after having reached the first
steady state. We further probe the occurrences of DQPTs when the system evolves
unitarily after being prepared in a mixed state of engineered purity by ramping
the transverse field in a linear fashion in the presence of the bath. In this
case though the fidelity approach fails to indicate any DQPT, the
interferometric approach indeed unravels the possibility of occurrence of DQPTs
which persists even up to a considerable loss of purity of the engineered
initial state as long as a constraint relation involving the dissipative
coupling and ramping time (rate) is satisfied. This constraint relation also
marks the boundary between two dynamically inequivalent phases; in one the LO
vanishes for the critical momentum mode (and hence DQPTs exist) while in the
other no such critical mode can exist and hence the LO never vanishes.

the electronic structure and magnetic moment of Cr$_2^+$. Our results indicate
that the removal of a single electron from the $4s\sigma_g$ bonding orbital of
Cr$_2$ drastically changes the preferred coupling of the $3d$ electronic spins.
While the neutral molecule has a zero-spin ground state with a very short bond
length, the molecular cation exhibits a ferromagnetically coupled ground state
with the highest possible spin of $S=11/2$, and almost twice the bond length of
the neutral molecule. This spin configuration can be interpreted as a result of
indirect exchange coupling between the $3d$ electrons of the two atoms that is
mediated by the single $4s$ electron through a strong intraatomic $3d$-$4s$
exchange interaction. Our finding allows an estimate of the relative energies
of two states that are often discussed as ground-state candidates, the
ferromagnetically coupled $^{12}\Sigma$ and the low-spin $^2\Sigma$ state.

in accuracy while preserving most of the advantages of binarization. We analyze
the binarization tradeoff using a metric that jointly models the input
binarization-error and computational cost and introduce an efficient algorithm
to select layers whose inputs are to be binarized. Practical guidelines based
on insights obtained from applying the algorithm to a variety of models are
discussed. Experiments on Imagenet dataset using AlexNet and ResNet-18 models
show 3-4% improvements in accuracy over fully binarized networks with minimal
impact on compression and computational speed. The improvements are even more
substantial on sketch datasets like TU-Berlin, where we match state-of-the-art

with individual layers or overall model compression (e.g., SqueezeNets). Unlike
previous quantization approaches, we are able to binarize the weights in the

the common order and disorder parameters of confinement: the temporal and
spatial Wilson loop, the Polyakov loop and the 't Hooft loop. Next the dual
Mei\ss ner effect, which assumes a condensate of magnetic monopoles, will be
explained as a picture of confinement. I will also show how magnetic monopoles
arises in QCD after the so-called Abelian projection. The second lecture is
devoted to the center vortex picture of confinement. Center vortices will be
defined both on the lattice and in the continuum. Within the center vortex
picture the emergence of the area law for the Wilson loop as well as the
deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature will be explained.
Furthermore, lattice evidence for the center vortex picture will be provided.
Finally, I will discuss the topological properties of center vortices and their
relation to magnetic monopoles. I will provide evidence from lattice
calculations that center vortices are not only responsible for confinement but
also for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. In the last lecture I
will present the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge, which is then
used to establish the Gribov--Zwanziger picture of confinement. Furthermore, I
will also relate this scenario to the dual Mei\ss ner effect and the center
vortex picture. Finally, I will study QCD at finite temperature within the
Hamiltonian approach in a novel way by compactifying one spatial dimension. The
Polyakov loop and the dual and chiral quark condensates will be evaluated as
function of the temperature.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The number of muons observed at the ground from
UHECR-induced air showers is expected to depend upon the hadronic interaction
model. One may therefore test the hadronic interaction models by comparing the
measured number of muons with the MC prediction. In this paper, we present the
results of studies of muon densities in UHE extensive air showers obtained by
analyzing the signal of surface detector stations which should have high
$\it{muon \, purity}$. The muon purity of a station will depend on both the
inclination of the shower and the relative position of the station. In 7 years'

observed for signals with an expected muon purity of $\sim$65% at a lateral
distance of 2000 m from the shower core is $1.72 \pm 0.10{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.37
{\rm (syst.)}$ times larger than the MC prediction value using the QGSJET II-03
model for proton-induced showers. A similar effect is also seen in comparisons
with other hadronic models such as QGSJET II-04, which shows a $1.67 \pm 0.10
\pm 0.36$ excess. We also studied the dependence of these excesses on lateral
distances and found a slower decrease of the lateral distribution of muons in
the data as compared to the MC, causing larger discrepancy at larger lateral
distances.

in resistivity following by a plateau at low temperature, which can be
understood by the compensation effect, and high mobility of carriers confirmed
by our Hall effect measurements. It was also found that the normalized MRs
under different magnetic fields has the same temperature dependence in
$\alpha$-WP$_2$, the Kohler scaling law can describe the MR data in a wide
temperature range, and there is no obvious change in the anisotropic parameter
$\gamma$ value with temperature. The resistance polar diagram has a peanut
shape when field is rotated in $\textit{ac}$ plane, which can be understood by
the anisotropy of Fermi surface. These results indicate that both

increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the

When all the weights are equal to 1, this parameter is equal to the proper

Here, we prove that the equivalent decision problem of the weighted proper

NP-complete on trees but can be solved by a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm

thus represent a much larger dynamic range in phase space density.

the connection among the PoW sub-blockchains employs a BFT inter-connector

overshadowed its practical implementation. In order to contribute to fill this
gap, we report here the preparation of new hybrid polymer-based materials where
bP nanoflakes exhibit a significantly improved stability. The new materials
have been prepared by different synthetic paths including: i) the mixing of
conventionally liquid-phase exfoliated bP (in DMSO) with PMMA solution; ii) the
direct exfoliation of bP in a polymeric solution; iii) the in situ radical
polymerization after exfoliating bP in the liquid monomer (methyl methacrylate,
MMA). This last methodology concerns the preparation of stable suspensions of
bPn-MMA by sonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of bP in the
presence of MMA followed by radical polymerization. The hybrids characteristics
have been compared in order to evaluate the bP dispersion and the effectiveness
of the bPn interfacial interactions with polymer chains aimed at their
long-term environmental stabilization. The passivation of bPn results
particularly effective when the hybrid material is prepared by in situ
polymerization. By using this synthetic methodology, the nanoflakes, even if
with a gradient of dispersion (size of aggregates), preserve their chemical
structure from oxidation (as proved by both Raman and 31P-Solid State NMR
studies) and are particularly stable to air and UV light exposure.

In these settings, the properties of these contexts make utilization of SMC
even more challenging since some of its vital premises regarding environmental

this gap by providing FlexSMC, a management and orchestration framework for SMC
which supports the discovery of nodes, supports a trust establishment between

software project planning and execution. However, its accuracy is dependent on
many factors, not least the avoidance of judgement biases, such as the
anchoring bias, arising from being influenced by initial information, even when
it's misleading or irrelevant. This strong effect is widely documented.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to replicate this anchoring bias using professionals and,
novel in a software engineering context, explore de-biasing interventions
through increasing knowledge and awareness of judgement biases. METHOD: We ran
two series of experiments in company settings with a total of 410 software
developers. Some developers took part in a workshop to heighten their awareness
of a range of cognitive biases, including anchoring. Later, the anchoring bias
was induced by presenting low or high productivity values, followed by the
participants' estimates of their own project productivity. Our hypothesis was
that the workshop would lead to reduced bias, i.e., work as a de-biasing
intervention. RESULTS: The anchors had a large effect (robust Cohen's $d=1.19$)
in influencing estimates. This was substantially reduced in those participants
who attended the workshop (robust Cohen's $d=0.72$). The reduced bias related
mainly to the high anchor. The de-biasing intervention also led to a threefold
reduction in estimate variance. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of anchors upon
judgement was substantial. Learning about judgement biases does appear capable
of mitigating, although not removing, the anchoring bias. The positive effect
of de-biasing through learning about biases suggests that it has value.

problem: lack or absence of parallel corpus for many languages. This article
suggests a method for generating considerable amount of parallel corpus for any
language pairs, extracted from open source materials existing on the Internet.
Parallel corpus contents will be derived from video subtitles. It needs a set
of video titles, with some attributes like release date, rating, duration and
etc. Process of finding and downloading subtitle pairs for desired language
pairs is automated by using a crawler. Finally sentence pairs will be extracted
from synchronous dialogues in subtitles. The main problem of this method is
unsynchronized subtitle pairs. Therefore subtitles will be verified before
downloading. If two subtitle were not synchronized, then another subtitle of
that video will be processed till it finds the matching subtitle. Using this
approach gives ability to make context based parallel corpus through filtering
videos by genre. Context based corpus can be used in complex translators which
decode sentences by different networks after determining contents subject.
Languages have many differences in their formal and informal styles, including
words and syntax. Other advantage of this method is to make corpus of informal
style of languages. Because most of movies dialogues are parts of a
conversation. So they had informal style. This feature of generated corpus can
be used in real-time translators to have more accurate conversation
translations.

become the dominant steady-state solutions because cubic parametric scattering

caused by several factors which are mismatched motion, field of view, motion
parallax, viewing angle, etc. Similar to motion sickness, VR sickness can
induce a lot of physical symptoms such as general discomfort, headache, stomach
awareness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and disorientation. To address the
viewing safety issues in virtual environment, it is of great importance to
develop an objective VR sickness assessment method that predicts and analyses
the degree of VR sickness induced by the VR content. The proposed method takes
into account motion information that is one of the most important factors in
determining the overall degree of VR sickness. In this paper, we detect the
exceptional motion that is likely to induce VR sickness. Spatio-temporal
features of the exceptional motion in the VR video content are encoded using a
convolutional autoencoder. For objectively assessing the VR sickness, the level
of exceptional motion in VR video content is measured by using the
convolutional autoencoder as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method has
been successfully evaluated by subjective assessment experiment using simulator

passwords and identify areas in need of improvement.
  Four distinct publicly-available password datasets (obtained from security
breaches, compiled by security experts, and designated as containing bad
passwords) are employed. As these datasets were released at different times,
the distributions characterizing these datasets suggest a chronological
evolution of password selection.
  A similarity metric, Levenshtein distance, is used to compare passwords in
each dataset against the designated benchmark of bad passwords. The resulting
distributions of normalized similarity scores are then compared to each other.
The comparison reveals an overall increase in the mean of the similarity
distributions corresponding to more recent datasets, implying a shift away from
the use of bad passwords.
  This conclusion is corroborated by the passwords' clustering behavior. An
encoding capturing best practices maps passwords to a high dimensional space
over which a $k$-means clustering (with silhouette coefficient) analysis is
performed. Cluster comparison and character frequency analysis indicates an
improvement in password selection over time with respect to certain features
(length, mixing character types), yet certain discouraged practices (name
inclusion, selection bias) still persist.

ecosystem inhabited by two strongly competing native species is modelled by a
three-species competition-diffusion system. It is known that for a certain
range of parameter values competitor-mediated coexistence occurs and complex
spatio-temporal patterns are observed in two spatial dimensions. In this paper
we uncover the mechanism which generates such patterns. Under some assumptions
on the parameters the three-species competition-diffusion system admits two
planarly stable travelling waves. Their interaction in one spatial dimension
may result in either reflection or merging into a single homoclinic wave,
depending on the strength of the invading species. This transition can be
understood by studying the bifurcation structure of the homoclinic wave. In
particular, a time-periodic homoclinic wave (breathing wave) is born from a
Hopf bifurcation and its unstable branch acts as a separator between the
reflection and merging regimes. The same transition occurs in two spatial
dimensions: the stable regular spiral associated to the homoclinic wave
destabilizes, giving rise first to an oscillating breathing spiral and then
breaking up producing a dynamic pattern characterized by many spiral cores. We
find that these complex patterns are generated by the interaction of two
planarly stable travelling waves, in contrast with many other well known cases
of pattern formation where planar instability plays a central role.

a collection of geometric regions in some space. The goal is to output a tour
of minimum length that visits at least one point in each region. Even in the
Euclidean plane, TSPN is known to be APX-hard, which gives rise to studying
more tractable special cases of the problem. In this paper, we focus on the
fundamental special case of regions that are hyperplanes in the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space. This case contrasts the much-better understood case of
so-called fat regions.
  While for $d=2$ an exact algorithm with running time $O(n^5)$ is known,
settling the exact approximability of the problem for $d=3$ has been repeatedly
posed as an open question. To date, only an approximation algorithm with
guarantee exponential in $d$ is known, and NP-hardness remains open.
  For arbitrary fixed $d$, we develop a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme
(PTAS) that works for both the tour and path version of the problem. Our
algorithm is based on approximating the convex hull of the optimal tour by a
convex polytope of bounded complexity. Such polytopes are represented as
solutions of a sophisticated LP formulation, which we combine with the
enumeration of crucial properties of the tour. As the approximation guarantee
approaches $1$, our scheme adjusts the complexity of the considered polytopes
accordingly.
  In the analysis of our approximation scheme, we show that our search space
includes a sufficiently good approximation of the optimum. To do so, we develop
a novel and general sparsification technique to transform an arbitrary convex
polytope into one with a constant number of vertices and, in turn, into one of
bounded complexity in the above sense. Hereby, we maintain important properties
of the polytope.

diameter satisfying a universal $\psi_2$-estimate. In particular, we obtain the
result for the important class of volume-normalized $\ell_p^d$-balls in the
complete regime $2\leq p \leq \infty$. This extends a result in a work of A.
Hinrichs, E. Novak, M. Ullrich and H. Wo\'zniakowski [J. Complexity, 30(2),
117-143, 2014] to the whole range $2\leq p \leq \infty$, and additionally
provides a unified approach. The key ingredient in the proof is a deep result
from the theory of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, the thin-shell volume
concentration estimate due to O. Gu\'edon and E. Milman. The connection of
Asymptotic Geometric Analysis and Information-based Complexity revealed in this
work seems promising and is of independent interest.

accurate results available in a variety of domains, and is a de facto standard
in these domains. Yet, it is also well known that Gibbs random walks usually
have bottlenecks, sometimes termed ""local maxima"", and thus samplers often
return suboptimal solutions. In this paper we introduce a variation of the
Gibbs sampler which yields high likelihood solutions significantly more often
than the regular Gibbs sampler.
  Specifically, we show that combining multiple samplers, with certain
dependence (coupling) between them, results in higher likelihood solutions.
This side-steps the well known issue of identifiability, which has been the
obstacle to combining samplers in previous work. We evaluate the approach on a
Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, and also on HMM's, where precise computation
of likelihoods and comparisons to the standard EM algorithm are possible.

from a single color image under large occlusions. Following recent approaches,
we first predict the 2D projections of 3D points related to the target object

method. Unfortunately, as the results of our experiments show, predicting these
2D projections using a regular CNN or a Convolutional Pose Machine is highly
sensitive to partial occlusions, even when these methods are trained with
partially occluded examples. Our solution is to predict heatmaps from multiple
small patches independently and to accumulate the results to obtain accurate
and robust predictions. Training subsequently becomes challenging because
patches with similar appearances but different positions on the object
correspond to different heatmaps. However, we provide a simple yet effective
solution to deal with such ambiguities. We show that our approach outperforms
existing methods on two challenging datasets: The Occluded LineMOD dataset and
the YCB-Video dataset, both exhibiting cluttered scenes with highly occluded

localization of smartphones has become an interesting research topic. Most of
the current indoor localization systems rely on intensive site survey to

localization system that is able to reduce the site survey effort while still
achieving high localization accuracy. Our system is built by fusing a variety
of signals, such as Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator, magnetic field
and floor plan information in an enhanced particle filter. To achieve high and
stable performance, we first apply discriminative learning models to integrate
Wi-Fi and magnetic field readings to achieve room level landmark detection.
Further, we integrate landmark detection, range-based localization models, with
a graph-based discretized system state representation. Because our approach
requires only discriminative learning-based room level landmark detections, the
time spent in the learning phase is significantly reduced compared to
traditional Wi-Fi fingerprinting or landmark-based approaches. We conduct
experimental studies to evaluate our system in an office-like indoor
environment. Experiment results show that our system can significantly reduce
the learning efforts, and the localization method can achieve performance with
an average localization error of 1.55 meters.

important indicator for the progress of a neuromuscular disease and the
efficacy of a therapy. Inference for realistic statistical models of the
typical data produced when testing muscle function is difficult, and estimating
the number of motor units from these data is an ongoing statistical challenge.
We consider a set of models for the data, each with a different number of
working motor units, and present a novel method for Bayesian inference, based
on sequential Monte Carlo, which provides estimates of the marginal likelihood
and, hence, a posterior probability for each model. To implement this approach
in practice we require sequential Monte Carlo methods that have excellent
computational and Monte Carlo properties. We achieve this by leveraging the
conditional independence structure in the model, where given knowledge of which
motor units fired as a result of a particular stimulus, parameters that specify
the size of each unit's response are independent of the parameters defining the
probability that a unit will respond at all. The scalability of our methodology
relies on the natural conjugacy structure that we create for the former and an
enforced, approximate conjugate structure for the latter. A simulation study
demonstrates the accuracy of our method, and inferences are consistent across
two different datasets arising from the same rat tibial muscle.

mechanism of these membranes is expected to give rise to anti-fouling
properties and multi-phase transport capabilities. However, the long-term
retention of the infusion liquid has not yet been explored. To address this
issue, we investigate the retention of the infusion liquid in slippery
liquid-infused membranes (SLIMs) via liquid-liquid displacement porometry
(LLDP) experiments combined with microscopic observations of the displacement
mechanism. Our results reveal that pores will be opened corresponding to the
capillary pressure, leading to preferential flow pathways for water transport.
The LLDP results further suggest the presence of liquid-lined pores in SLIM.
This hypothesis is analyzed theoretically using an interfacial pore flow model.
We find that the displacement patterns correspond to capillary fingering in
immiscible displacement in porous media. The related physics regarding
two-phase flow in porous media is used to confirm the permeation mechanism
appearing in SLIMs. In order to experimentally observe liquid-liquid
displacement, a microfluidic chip mimicking a porous medium is designed and a
highly ramified structure with trapped infusion liquid is observed. The
remaining infusion liquid is retained as pools, bridges and thin films around
pillar structures in the chip, which further confirms liquid-lining. Fractal
dimension analysis, along with evaluation of the fluid (non-wetting phase)
saturation, further confirms that the fractal patterns correspond to capillary
fingering, which is consistent with an invasion percolation with trapping (IPT)
model.

interacts with agents in a community with different levels of prosociality and
show how agent identifiability can aid negotiation.

graph H, can we partition the vertices of G into two non-empty sets A and B
such that neither the induced graph G[A] nor G[B] contain H (i) as a subgraph?
(ii) as an induced subgraph? These problems are NP-complete and are expressible
in monadic second order logic (MSOL). The MSOL formulation, together with
Courcelle's theorem implies linear time solvability on graphs with bounded
tree-width. This approach yields algorithms with running time f(|phi|, t) * n,
where |phi| is the length of the MSOL formula, t is the tree-width of the graph
and n is the number of vertices of the graph. The dependency of f(|phi|, t) on
|phi| can be as bad as a tower of exponentials.
  In this paper, we present explicit combinatorial algorithms for these
problems for graphs G whose tree-width is bounded. We obtain 2^{O(t^r)} * n
time algorithms when H is any fixed graph of order r. In the special case when
H = K_r, a complete graph on r vertices, we get an 2^{O(t+r \log t)} * n time
algorithm.
  The techniques can be extended to provide FPT algorithms to determine the
smallest number q such that V can be partitioned into q parts such that none of
the parts have H as a subgraph (induced subgraph).

continuous fragmentation models, this work concerns the development and the
mathematical analysis of a new class of hybrid discrete--continuous
fragmentation models. Once established, the model, which takes the form of an
integro-differential equation coupled with a system of ordinary differential
equations, is subjected to a rigorous mathematical analysis, using the theory
and methods of operator semigroups and their generators. Most notably, by
applying the theory relating to the Kato--Voigt perturbation theorem, honest
substochastic semigroups and operator matrices, the existence of a unique,

shown to preserve nonnegativity and conserve mass.

well-posedness for this equation has been proven using the Wigner transform
when $\left< v \right>^\beta f_0 \in L^2_v H^\alpha_x$ for $\min (\alpha,\beta)

$\left< x \right>^k \left< \nabla_v \right>^\ell f \in L^\infty_T L^2_{x,v}$ if

continuity of the solution map in $H^{\alpha,\beta}$. Altogether, these results

features while dealing with large volume of data. Towards such goal,
Convolutional Networks can learn specific and adaptable features based on the
data. However, these networks are not capable of processing a whole remote
sensing image, given its huge size. To overcome such limitation, the image is
processed using fixed size patches. The definition of the input patch size is
usually performed empirically (evaluating several sizes) or imposed (by network
constraint). Both strategies suffer from drawbacks and could not lead to the
best patch size. To alleviate this problem, several works exploited
multi-context information by combining networks or layers. This process
increases the number of parameters resulting in a more difficult model to
train. In this work, we propose a novel technique to perform semantic
segmentation of remote sensing images that exploits a multi-context paradigm
without increasing the number of parameters while defining, in training time,
the best patch size. The main idea is to train a dilated network with distinct
patch sizes, allowing it to capture multi-context characteristics from
heterogeneous contexts. While processing these varying patches, the network
provides a score for each patch size, helping in the definition of the best
size for the current scenario. A systematic evaluation of the proposed
algorithm is conducted using four high-resolution remote sensing datasets with
very distinct properties. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides
improvements in pixelwise classification accuracy when compared to

experts often invest days or even weeks of works. The standard matrix chain
problem consists in finding the parenthesization of a matrix product $M := A_1
A_2 \cdots A_n$ that minimizes the number of scalar operations. In practical
applications, however, one frequently encounters more complicated expressions,
involving transposition, inversion, and matrix properties. Indeed, the
computation of such expressions relies on a set of computational kernels that
offer functionality well beyond the simple matrix product. The challenge then
shifts from finding an optimal parenthesization to finding an optimal mapping
of the input expression to the available kernels. Furthermore, it is often the
case that a solution based on the minimization of scalar operations does not
result in the optimal solution in terms of execution time. In our experiments,
the generated code outperforms other libraries and languages on average by a
factor of about 9. The motivation for this work comes from the fact
that---despite great advances in the development of compilers---the task of
mapping linear algebra problems to optimized kernels is still to be done
manually. In order to relieve the user from this complex task, new techniques
for the compilation of linear algebra expressions have to be developed.

revealed that events form aftershock sequences obeying characteristic laws

viscosity. This concept arises from a macroscopic view and was first introduced
by Sir Isaac Newton. Nonetheless, a fluid is a series of moving molecules that
are constrained by the shape of the container. Such a view begs the treatment
of viscosity from a microscopic or molecular view, a task undertaken by both
Einstein and Smoluchowski independently. Here we revisit the concept of
viscosity and experimentally verify that the viscosity at a molecular level,
which describes the drag force, is the same as the macroscopic shear viscosity;
hence, bridging different length- and time-scales. For capturing the shear
stress response of a fluid, we use classical rheometry; at a molecular level we
use probe diffusion to determine the local viscosity from the translational and
rotational motions. In these cases, we use Fluorescence Correlation
Spectroscopy and Time Resolved Fluorescence, respectively. By increasing the
osmolyte (Glucose-D) concentration, we change the viscosity and find that these
methods provide a unified view of viscosity bridging the gap between the
macroscopic and nanoscale regimes. Moreover, Glucose's viscosity follows a
scaling factor more commonly associated to solutions of branched polymer
because the probe dimensions are comparable to the dimensions of the osmolyte
that exerts the drag.

Resistance problem, where the goal is to maintain effective resistances on a
graph $G$ among any pair of query vertices under an intermixed sequence of edge
insertions and deletions in $G$. The effective resistance between a pair of
vertices is a physics-motivated quantity that encapsulates both the congestion
and the dilation of a flow. It is directly related to random walks, and it has
been instrumental in the recent works for designing fast algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems, graph sparsification, and network science.
  We give a data-structure that maintains $(1+\epsilon)$-approximations to
all-pair effective resistances of a fully-dynamic unweighted, undirected
multi-graph $G$ with $\tilde{O}(m^{4/5}\epsilon^{-4})$ expected amortized
update and query time, against an oblivious adversary. Key to our result is the
maintenance of a dynamic \emph{Schur complement}~(also known as vertex
resistance sparsifier) onto a set of terminal vertices of our choice.
  This maintenance is obtained (1) by interpreting the Schur complement as a
sum of random walks and (2) by randomly picking the vertex subset into which
the sparsifier is constructed. We can then show that each update in the graph
affects a small number of such walks, which in turn leads to our sub-linear
update time. We believe that this local representation of vertex sparsifiers
may be of independent interest.

investigate a discrete time model where the time axis is partitioned into
frames. Each frame consists of a sensing phase, followed by a transmission
phase. During the sensing phase, the user is able to sense a subset of channels
sequentially before it decides to use one of them in the following transmission
phase. We assume the channel states alternate between busy and idle according
to independent Bernoulli random processes from frame to frame. To capture the
inherent uncertainty in channel sensing, we assume the reward of each
transmission when the channel is idle is a random variable. We also associate
random costs with sensing and transmission actions. Our objective is to
understand how the costs and reward of the actions would affect the optimal
behavior of the user in both offline and online settings, and design the
corresponding opportunistic spectrum access strategies to maximize the expected
cumulative net reward (i.e., reward-minus-cost). We start with an offline
setting where the statistics of the channel status, costs and reward are known
beforehand. We show that the the optimal policy exhibits a recursive double
threshold structure, and the user needs to compare the channel statistics with
those thresholds sequentially in order to decide its actions. With such
insights, we then study the online setting, where the statistical information
of the channels, costs and reward are unknown a priori. We judiciously balance
exploration and exploitation, and show that the cumulative regret scales in
O(log T). We also establish a matched lower bound, which implies that our
online algorithm is order-optimal. Simulation results corroborate our
theoretical analysis.

Previous work has found
little evidence for correlations between large-scale bias and halo mass
assembly history for simulated cluster-sized halos, in contrast to the
significant correlation found between bias and concentration for halos of this
mass. This difference in behavior is surprising, given that both concentration
and assembly history are closely related to the same properties of the
linear-density peaks that collapse to form halos. Using publicly available
simulations, we show that significant assembly bias is indeed found in the most
massive halos with $M\sim 10^{15}M_\odot$, using essentially any definition of
halo age. For lower halo masses $M\sim 10^{14}M_\odot$, no correlation is found
between bias and the commonly used age indicator $a_{0.5}$, the half-mass time.
We show that this is a mere accident, and that significant assembly bias exists
for other definitions of halo age, including those based on the time when the
halo progenitor acquires some fraction $f$ of the ultimate mass at $z=0$. For
halos with $M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{14}M_\odot$, the sense of assembly bias changes
sign at $f=0.5$. We explore the origin of this behavior, and argue that it
arises because standard definitions of halo mass in halo finders do not
correspond to the collapsed, virialized mass that appears in the spherical
collapse model used to predict large-scale clustering. Because bias depends
strongly on halo mass, these errors in mass definition can masquerade as or
even obscure the assembly bias that is physically present. More physically
motivated halo definitions using splashback should be free of this particular
defect of standard halo finders.

gravity are examined using a large set of equations of state. The numerical
calculations are made using two different approaches -- performing time
evolution of the perturbation equations and solving the time-independent
representation of the equations as a boundary value problem. According to the
results the mode frequencies and the damping times decrease with the increase
of the free parameter of the theory in comparison to the pure general
relativistic case. While the frequencies deviate significantly from Einstein's
theory for all realistic neutron star masses (say above $1M_\odot$), the
damping times reach non-negligible differences only for the more massive
models. We have constructed as well universal (equation of state independent)
gravitational wave asteroseismology relations involving the frequencies and the
damping times. It turns out that the equation of state independence is
preserved using the same normalization as in pure general relativity and the
qualitative differences of the phenomenological relations with respect to
Einstein's theory of gravity can be large for large values of the free
parameter in $f(R)$ gravity.

simulations to robustly determine the central coordinates and the structural
parameters and $T_1\times(C-T_1)$ colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) cleaned from

Ruprecht 121, ESO 134-12 and NGC 6573 resulted to be of nearly the same young
age (8.2 $\leq\textrm{log}(t \textrm{yr}^{-1})\leq$ 8.3); ESO 260-7 and
ESO065-7 are of intermediate age (9.2 $\leq\textrm{log}(t

Galactocentric distances (R$_{G}\sim6-6.9 $kpc), considering uncertainties,
except for ESO 260-7 ($R_{G}=8.9 $kpc). These OCs are in a tidally filled
regime and are dynamically evolved, since they are much older than their
half-mass relaxation times ($t/t_{rh}\gtrsim30$) and present signals of
low-mass star depletion. We distinguished two groups: those dynamically
evolving towards final disruptions and those in an advanced dynamical
evolutionary stage. Although we do not rule out that the Milky Way potential
could have made differentially faster their dynamical evolutions, we speculate
here with the possibility that they have been mainly driven by initial
formation conditions.

neural networks that focuses on speed. It supports feed-forward neural networks
such as fully-connected Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). It also has very comprehensive support for Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Convolutional RBMs. Our main motivation for this
work was to propose and evaluate novel software engineering strategies with
potential to accelerate runtime for training and inference. Such strategies are
mostly independent of the underlying deep learning algorithms. On three
different datasets and for four different neural network models, we compared
DLL to five popular deep learning frameworks. Experimentally, it is shown that
the proposed framework is systematically and significantly faster on CPU and
GPU. In terms of classification performance, similar accuracies as the other
frameworks are reported.

  Oct. 2013, Vol. 3 Iss. 10, PP. 477-491",,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The connected allograph representing calligraphic Arabic word does not appear
individually in any calligraphic resource but in association with other letters
all adapted to each other. The graphic segmentation of the word by respecting
aesthetical attributes indicating the grapheme of every letter is far from
being an obvious task. The question consists in discovering every letter
constituting the word, points of cutting which separate its grapheme from other
constituents of word's shape. The obtained segment must be a complete drawing
of the represented letter. This segmentation according to contextual graphic
and qualitative criteria connecting the attached allograph will have to satisfy
typographic constraints varying in conformity with the possibilities offered by
the wanted technology. In this paper, we develop an approach for segmenting
Arabic word from which the purpose is to extract graphemes respecting the
design of Arabic letters such as it is in the calligraphic literature. The
procedure bases itself on the principle that the Arabic connected letters have
a common part included in the cursive area, which must not be lost during the
process of cutting.

their base letter, without having to deal individually and separately each pair
of base letter and diacritics.

Most
people, including the authors, think it feels wrong to switch the initial
choice of one of the three doors, despite having fully accepted the
mathematical proof for its superiority. Many people, if given the choice to
switch, think the chances are fifty-fifty between their options, but still
strongly prefer to stay with their initial choice. Is there some sense behind
these irrational feelings?
  We entertain the possibility that intuition solves the problem of how to
behave in a real game show, not in the abstract textbook version of the Monty
Hall problem. A real showmaster sometimes plays evil, either to make the show
more interesting, to save money, or because he is in a bad mood. A moody
showmaster erases any information advantage the guest could extract by him
opening other doors which drives the chance of the car being behind the chosen
door towards fifty percent. Furthermore, the showmaster could try to read or
manipulate the guest's strategy to the guest's disadvantage. Given this, the
preference to stay with the initial choice turns out to be a very rational
defense strategy of the show's guest against the threat of being manipulated by
its host. Thus, the intuitive feelings most people have about the Monty Hall
problem coincide with what would be a rational strategy for a real-world game
show. Although these investigations are mainly intended to be an entertaining
mathematical commentary on an information-theoretic puzzle, they touch on
interesting psychological questions.

distribution of charged hadron multiplicity in the framework of a multiphase
transport (AMPT) model at two different collision energies. The mean radial
velocity seems to be a good probe for studying radial expansion. While the
anisotropic part of the distributions indicates a kind of collective nature of
radial expansion, the isotropic part characterizes a thermal motion. The
present investigation is carried out keeping the upcoming Compressed Baryonic
Matter (CBM) experiment to be held at the Facility for Anti-proton Ion Research

will supplement the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron

baryochemical potential would be interesting, when scrutinized from the
perspective of almost a baryon free environment achieved at RHIC and LHC.

In a second part, we extend it to circular tracks (for charged particles) and
even a mix of linear and circular tracks. This algorithm is implemented in an

for transversely isotropic (TI) materials under finite deformation. For the
first time, distinct relaxation responses are incorporated into an integral
formulation of nonlinear viscoelasticity, according to the physical mode of
deformation. The theory is consistent with linear viscoelasticity in the small
strain limit and makes use of relaxation functions that can be determined from
small-strain experiments, given the time/deformation separability assumption.
After considering the general constitutive form applicable to compressible
materials, attention is restricted to incompressible media. This enables a
compact form for the constitutive relation to be derived, which is used to
illustrate the behaviour of the model under three key deformations: uniaxial
extension, transverse shear and longitudinal shear. Finally, it is demonstrated
that the Poynting effect is present in transversely isotropic, neo-Hookean,
modified QLV materials under transverse shear, in contrast to neo-Hookean
elastic materials subjected to the same deformation. Its presence is explained
by the anisotropic relaxation response of the medium.
