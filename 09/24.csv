dispatching controllable distributed energy resources (DERs) for voltage
regulation at minimum cost. The proposed algorithm features unprecedented
scalability to large distribution networks by utilizing an information
structure based on networked autonomous grids (AGs). Specifically, each AG is a
subtree of a large distribution network that has a tree topology. The topology
and line parameters of each AG are known only to a regional coordinator (RC)
that is responsible for communicating with and dispatching the DERs within this
AG. The reduced network, where each AG is treated as a node, is managed by a
central coordinator (CC), which knows the topology and line parameters of the
reduced network only and communicates with all the RCs. We jointly explore this
information structure and the structure of the linearized distribution power
flow (LinDistFlow) model to derive a hierarchical, distributed implementation
of the primal-dual gradient algorithm that solves the OPF. The proposed
implementation significantly reduces the computation burden compared to the
centrally coordinated implementation of the primal-dual algorithm. Numerical
results on a 4,521-node test feeder show that the proposed hierarchical
distributed algorithm can achieve an improvement of more than tenfold in the
speed of convergence compared to the centrally coordinated primal-dual
algorithm.

fields. For example, robotics is used to increase productivity while reducing
costs in various aspects of manufacturing. Since robots are often set up in
production lines, the breakdown of a single robot has a negative impact on the
entire process, in the worst case bringing the whole line to a halt until the
issue is resolved, leading to substantial financial losses due to the
unforeseen downtime. Therefore, predictive maintenance systems based on the
internal signals of robots have gained attention as an essential component of
robotics service offerings. The main shortcoming of existing predictive
maintenance algorithms is that the extracted features typically differ
significantly from the learnt model when the operation of the robot changes,
incurring false alarms. In order to mitigate this problem, predictive
maintenance algorithms require the model to be retrained with normal data of
the new operation. In this paper, we propose a novel solution based on transfer
learning to pass the knowledge of the trained model from one operation to
another in order to prevent the need for retraining and to eliminate such false
alarms. The deployment of the proposed unsupervised transfer learning algorithm
on real-world datasets demonstrates that the algorithm can not only distinguish
between operation and mechanical condition change, it further yields a sharper
deviation from the trained model in case of a mechanical condition change and
thus detects mechanical issues with higher confidence.

Multi-socket systems built from these processors are routinely used for running

presents a new operating system (OS) scheduling optimization to reduce the
impact of such remote memory accesses. By observing the pattern of local and
remote DRAM accesses for every thread in each scheduling quantum and applying
different algorithms, we come up with a new schedule of threads for the next
quantum. This new schedule potentially cuts down remote DRAM accesses for the
next scheduling quantum and improves overall performance. We present three such
new algorithms of varying complexity followed by an algorithm which is an
adaptation of Hungarian algorithm. We used three different synthetic workloads
to evaluate the algorithm. We also performed sensitivity analysis with respect
to varying DRAM latency. We show that these algorithms can cut down DRAM access
latency by up to 55% depending on the algorithm used. The benefit gained from
the algorithms is dependent upon their complexity. In general higher the
complexity higher is the benefit. Hungarian algorithm results in an optimal
solution. We find that two out of four algorithms provide a good trade-off

The interface combines electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain signals and
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information noninvasively to
the brain. The interface allows three human subjects to collaborate and solve a
task using direct brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are
""Senders"" whose brain signals are decoded using real-time EEG data analysis to
extract decisions about whether to rotate a block in a Tetris-like game before
it is dropped to fill a line. The Senders' decisions are transmitted via the
Internet to the brain of a third subject, the ""Receiver,"" who cannot see the
game screen. The decisions are delivered to the Receiver's brain via magnetic
stimulation of the occipital cortex. The Receiver integrates the information
received and makes a decision using an EEG interface about either turning the
block or keeping it in the same position. A second round of the game gives the
Senders one more chance to validate and provide feedback to the Receiver's
action. We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level
performance during the game; (2) True/False positive rates of subjects'
decisions; (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five groups of three
subjects successfully used BrainNet to perform the Tetris task, with an average
accuracy of 0.813. Furthermore, by varying the information reliability of the
Senders by artificially injecting noise into one Sender's signal, we found that
Receivers are able to learn which Sender is more reliable based solely on the
information transmitted to their brains. Our results raise the possibility of
future brain-to-brain interfaces that enable cooperative problem solving by
humans using a ""social network"" of connected brains.

water resources planning, development, and management. The natural variability
of streamflow is being complicated by anthropogenic influences and climate
change, which may introduce additional complexity into the phenomenological
records. To address this question for daily discharge data recorded during the
period 1989-2016 at twelve gauging stations on Brazos River in Texas (USA), we
use a set of novel quantitative tools: Kolmogorov complexity (KC) with its
derivative associated measures to assess complexity, and Lyapunov time (LT) to
assess predictability. We find that all daily discharge series exhibit long
memory with an increasing downflow tendency, while the randomness of the series
at individual sites cannot be definitively concluded. All Kolmogorov complexity
measures have relatively small values with the exception of the USGS (United
States Geological Survey) 08088610 station at Graford, Texas, which exhibits
the highest values of these complexity measures. This finding may be attributed
to the elevated effect of human activities at Graford, and proportionally
lesser effect at other stations. In addition, complexity tends to decrease
downflow, meaning that larger catchments are generally less influenced by
anthropogenic activity. The correction on randomness of Lyapunov time
(quantifying predictability) is found to be inversely proportional to the
Kolmogorov complexity, which strengthens our conclusion regarding the effect of
anthropogenic activities, considering that KC and LT are distinct measures,
based on rather different techniques.

components and are essential tools for optical communications and for precision
metrology, timing and spectroscopy. To date, wide-spanning combs are most often
generated by mode-locked lasers or dispersion-engineered resonators with
third-order Kerr nonlinearity. An alternative comb generation method uses
electro-optic (EO) phase modulation in a resonator with strong second-order
nonlinearity, resulting in combs with excellent stability and controllability.
Previous EO combs, however, have been limited to narrow widths by a weak EO
interaction strength and a lack of dispersion engineering in free-space
systems. In this work, we overcome these limitations by realizing an integrated
EO comb generator in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform that
features a large electro-optic response, ultra-low optical loss and highly
co-localized microwave and optical felds, while enabling dispersion
engineering. Our measured EO frequency comb spans more than the entire
telecommunications L-band (over 900 comb lines spaced at ~ 10 GHz), and we show
that future dispersion engineering can enable octave-spanning combs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the high tolerance of our comb generator to
modulation frequency detuning, with frequency spacing finely controllable over
seven orders of magnitude (10 Hz to 100 MHz), and utilize this feature to
generate dual frequency combs in a single resonator. Our results show that
integrated EO comb generators, capable of generating wide and stable comb
spectra, are a powerful complement to integrated Kerr combs, enabling
applications ranging from spectroscopy to optical communications.

predicting the number of electromagnetic signals characterised by a specific
light curve and spectrum, expected in a particular sky survey. By looking at
past surveys, saprEMo allows us to constrain models of electromagnetic emission
or event rates. Applying saprEMo to proposed astronomical missions/observing
campaigns provides a perspective on their scientific impact and tests the
effect of adopting different observational strategies. For our first case
study, we adopt a model of spindown-powered X-ray emission predicted for a
binary neutron star merger producing a long-lived neutron star. We apply
saprEMo on data collected by XMM-Newton and Chandra and during $10^4$ s of
observations with the mission concept THESEUS. We demonstrate that our emission
model and binary neutron star merger rate imply the presence of some signals in
the XMM-Newton catalogs. We also show that the new class of X-ray transients
found by Bauer et al. in the Chandra Deep Field-South is marginally consistent
with the expected rate. Finally, by studying the mission concept THESEUS, we
demonstrate the substantial impact of a much larger field of view in searches
of X-ray transients.

is strongly suppressed relative to the steady-state value at low wavenumbers by
a factor proportional to the lifetime of the sources, and that this suppression
may be used to constrain QSO lifetimes. The total HI LyA power spectrum
including shot noise is affected at tens of percent on short scales, and by as
much as an order of magnitude or more on scales exceeding the mean free path.
The spatial correlation function is similarly found to be sensitive to the shot
noise, although moderately insensitive to the effects of time-dependence on the
non-shotnoise contribution. Photoionization rate fluctuations substantially
modify the shape of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation peak in the correlation
function, including a small increase in its position that must be accounted for
to avoid biasing estimates of cosmological parameters based on the peak
position. We briefly investigate solving the full frequency dependent equation,
finding that it agrees with the frequency-independent to better than percent

choosing only the minimum or the maximum (i.e., extreme) value from that set is
of special interest because of the ultra-low energy, storage, and processing

of strings, and needs to find a shortest string containing each of them as a

SODA'13). While this algorithm and its analysis are technically involved, the
30 years old Greedy Conjecture claims that the trivial and efficient Greedy
Algorithm gives a 2-approximation for SCS.
  We develop a graph-theoretic framework for studying approximation algorithms
for SCS. The framework is reminiscent of the classical 2-approximation for
Traveling Salesman: take two copies of an optimal solution, apply a trivial
edge-collapsing procedure, and get an approximate solution. In this framework,
we observe two surprising properties of SCS solutions, and we conjecture that
they hold for all input instances. The first conjecture, that we call
Collapsing Superstring conjecture, claims that there is an elementary way to
transform any solution repeated twice into the same graph $G$. This conjecture
would give an elementary 2-approximate algorithm for SCS. The second conjecture
claims that not only the resulting graph $G$ is the same for all solutions, but
that $G$ can be computed by an elementary greedy procedure called Greedy
Hierarchical Algorithm.
  While the second conjecture clearly implies the first one, perhaps
surprisingly we prove their equivalence. We support these equivalent
conjectures by giving a proof for the special case where all input strings have
length at most 3. We prove that the standard Greedy Conjecture implies Greedy
Hierarchical Conjecture, while the latter is sufficient for an efficient greedy
2-approximate approximation of SCS. Except for its (conjectured) good
approximation ratio, the Greedy Hierarchical Algorithm provably finds a
3.5-approximation.

for the induced mass of a solid sphere to the case of a fluid sphere. For a
more general ellipsoidal thermal, we show that the buoyant acceleration is a
simple analytical function of the ellipsoid's aspect ratio. The relevance of
these idealized uniform-density results to turbulent thermals is explored by
analyzing direct numerical simulations of thermals at $\textit{Re}=6300$. We
find that our results fully characterize a thermal's initial motion over a
distance comparable to its length. Beyond this buoyancy-dominated regime, a
thermal develops an ellipsoidal vortex circulation and begins to entrain
environmental fluid. Our analytical expressions do not describe the total
acceleration of this mature thermal, but still accurately relate the buoyant
acceleration to the thermal's mean Archimedean buoyancy and aspect ratio. Thus,
our analytical formulae provide a simple and direct means of estimating the

velocity field is solved by the recently developed multiple-relaxation-time
(MRT) LB equation for density distribution function (DF), by which a
self-tuning EOS can be recovered. As to the temperature field, a novel MRT LB
equation for total energy DF is directly developed at the discrete level. By
introducing a density-DF-related term into this LB equation and devising the
equilibrium moment function for total energy DF, the viscous dissipation and
compression work are consistently considered, and by modifying the collision
matrix, the targeted energy conservation equation is recovered without
deviation term. The full coupling of thermo-hydrodynamic effects is achieved
via the self-tuning EOS and the viscous dissipation and compression work. The
present LB model is developed on the basis of the standard lattice, and various
EOSs can be adopted in real applications. Moreover, both the Prandtl number and
specific heat ratio can be arbitrarily adjusted. Furthermore, boundary
condition treatment is also proposed on the basis of the judicious
decomposition of DF into its equilibrium, force (source), and nonequilibrium
parts. The local conservation of mass, momentum, and energy can be strictly
satisfied at the boundary node. Numerical simulations of thermal Poiseuille and
Couette flows are carried out with three different EOSs, and the numerical
results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions. Then, natural
convection in a square cavity with a large temperature difference is simulated
for the Rayleigh number from $10^3$ up to $10^8$. Good agreement between the

training is performed on truncated domains, and thus does not require full

potential to greatly reduce training cost. Geometry-specific training is
replaced by the response generated by perturbing the characteristics at the

aurora on 18 January 1770 in order to study the characteristics of this event.
The records indicate that the phenomenon was observed in both continental and
insular territories of Spain, in particular at San Crist\'obal de la Laguna,
C\'adiz, C\'ordoba, Badajoz, Valencia, Castell\'on, Madrid, Barcelona, and
Gerri de la Sal. The most equatorward observational site was San Crist\'obal de
la Laguna (28.48{\deg} N, 16.32{\deg} W) in the Canary Islands. In general, the
descriptions put its duration from sunset to midnight, but the observers from
C\'ordoba and Madrid report the aurora as being visible during the last hours
of the night, and it was even observed the following day at Castell\'on. All
the observers described the aurora as red in colour, while white and ash
colours were also reported at C\'ordoba and Gerri de la Sal. The brightness and
shape of auroral display changed over time. Calculations of the geomagnetic
latitudes of the observation locations gave San Crist\'obal de la Laguna as the
southernmost (26{\deg} N) to Gerri de la Sal the northernmost (35{\deg} N), and
indicate this aurora was observed over a wide range of abnormally low latitudes
for such a phenomenon. Solar activity around the event was high, with the
astronomer Horrebow registering 10 sunspot groups on that date (18 January
1770).

understand the differences between dCS and GR. We study dynamical signatures of
dCS considering that the scalar field potential has a mass term. We analyze the
influence of the theory's parameter into the quasibound states and in the time

gravitational perturbations become contaminated with the scalar sector,
presenting an oscillation that depends on the quasibound state frequencies.

Machine is usually straightforward and/or inessential for discrete data (like
graphs), but delicate -- heavily affecting computability and even more
computational complexity -- already regarding real numbers, not to mention more
advanced (e.g. Sobolev) spaces. For a general theory of computational
complexity over continuous data we introduce and justify QUANTITATIVE
admissibility as requirement for sensible encodings of arbitrary compact metric
spaces, a refinement of qualitative 'admissibility' due to
[Kreitz&Weihrauch'85]:
  An admissible representation of a T0 space $X$ is a (i) continuous partial
surjective mapping from the Cantor space of infinite binary sequences which is
(ii) maximal w.r.t. continuous reduction. By the Kreitz-Weihrauch (aka ""Main"")
Theorem of computability over continuous data, for fixed spaces $X,Y$ equipped
with admissible representations, a function $f:X\to Y$ is continuous iff it
admits continuous a code-translating mapping on Cantor space, a so-called
REALIZER. We define a QUANTITATIVELY admissible representation of a compact
metric space $X$ to have (i) asymptotically optimal modulus of continuity,
namely close to the entropy of $X$, and (ii) be maximal w.r.t. reduction having
optimal modulus of continuity in a similar sense.
  Careful constructions show the category of such representations to be
Cartesian closed, and non-empty: every compact $X$ admits a linearly-admissible
representation. Moreover such representations give rise to a tight quantitative
correspondence between the modulus of continuity of a function $f:X\to Y$ on
the one hand and on the other hand that of its realizer: the MAIN THEOREM of
computational complexity. This suggests (how) to take into account the
entropies of the spaces under consideration when measuring algorithmic cost
over continuous data.

theorems for paraboloids and spheres. By using the unusual good Fourier
transform of the zero sphere in some specific dimensions, which has been
discovered recently in the work of Iosevich, Lee, Shen, and the first and
second listed authors (2018), we provide a new $L^2\to L^r$ extension estimate
for paraboloids in dimensions $d=4k+3$ and $q\equiv 3\mod 4$, which improves
significantly the recent exponent obtained by the first listed author. In the
case of spheres, we introduce a way of using \textit{the first association
scheme graph} to analyze energy sets, and as a consequence, we obtain new
$L^p\to L^4$ extension theorems for spheres of primitive radii in odd
dimensions, which break the Stein-Tomas result toward $L^p\to L^4$ which has
stood for more than ten years. Most significantly, it follows from the results
for spheres that there exists a different extension phenomenon between spheres
and paraboloids in odd dimensions, namely, the $L^p\to L^4$ estimates for
spheres with primitive radii are much stronger than those for paraboloids.
Based on new estimates, we will also clarify conjectures on finite field
extension problem for spheres. This results in a reasonably complete
description of finite field extension theorems for spheres. The second purpose
is to show that there is a connection between the restriction conjecture
associated to paraboloids and the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance conjecture over
finite fields. The last is to prove that the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance
conjecture holds in odd-dimensional spaces when we study distances between two
sets: one set lies on a variety (paraboloids or spheres), and the other set is
arbitrary in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$.

scintillation readout by 4092 VUV-MPPCs with an active area of
$139\,\mathrm{mm}^2$ each, totalling $0.57\,\mathrm{m}^2$. The VUV-MPPC shows
an excellent performance in LXe, which includes a high photon detection

high gain, a low probability of the optical cross-talk and the after-pulsing, a
low dark count rate and a good single photoelectron resolution. The large
active area of the VUV-MPPC is formed by connecting four independent small
VUV-MPPC chips in series to avoid the increase of the sensor capacitance and
thus, to have a short pulse-decay-time, which is crucial for high rate
experiments. Performance tests of 4180 VUV-MPPCs produced for the LXe detector

properly. The design and performance of the VUV-MPPC are described in detail as

skills, and how complex networks can grow from simple probabilistic rules, or
even emerge from the interaction between agents and their environment, without
explicit social factors. We further show that the analysis of social networks
can be used to develop good indicators of social complexity beyond the
individual or dyadic level. We also discuss the types of challenges that the
social brain must cope with in structured groups, such as higher information
fluxes, originating from individuals playing different roles in the network, or
dyadic contacts of widely varying durations and frequencies. We discuss the

different data science disciplines. Despite their broad applicability,
inference under these models typically leads to computationally challenging
non-convex problems. While the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is the
most popular approach for solving these non-convex problems, the behavior of
this algorithm is not well understood. In this work, we focus on the case of
mixture of Laplacian (or Gaussian) distribution. We start by analyzing a simple
equally weighted mixture of two single dimensional Laplacian distributions and
show that every local optimum of the population maximum likelihood estimation
problem is globally optimal. Then, we prove that the EM algorithm converges to
the ground truth parameters almost surely with random initialization. Our
result extends the existing results for Gaussian distribution to Laplacian
distribution. Then we numerically study the behavior of mixture models with
more than two components. Motivated by our extensive numerical experiments, we
propose a novel stochastic method for estimating the mean of components of a
mixture model. Our numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms
the Naive EM algorithm in almost all scenarios.

surveys the recent advances of the applications of ML in wireless
communication, which are classified as: resource management in the MAC layer,
networking and mobility management in the network layer, and localization in
the application layer. The applications in resource management further include
power control, spectrum management, backhaul management, cache management,
beamformer design and computation resource management, while ML based
networking focuses on the applications in clustering, base station switching
control, user association and routing. Moreover, literatures in each aspect is
organized according to the adopted ML techniques. In addition, several
conditions for applying ML to wireless communication are identified to help
readers decide whether to use ML and which kind of ML techniques to use, and
traditional approaches are also summarized together with their performance
comparison with ML based approaches, based on which the motivations of surveyed
literatures to adopt ML are clarified. Given the extensiveness of the research

developed to conduct simulations of transcritical fuel spray mixing and
auto-ignition at high-pressure conditions. The simulation is based on a
recently developed diffused interface method that solves the compressible
multi-species conservation equations along with a Peng-Robinson state equation
and real-fluid transport properties. LES analysis is performed for non-reacting

chamber conditions with a pressure of 60 bar and temperatures between 900 K and
1200 K to investigate effects of the real-fluid environment and low-temperature

Analysis of the mixture fraction distributions in the dispersed spray region
demonstrates the accuracy in modelling the turbulent mixing behavior. Good
agreement of the ignition delay time and the lift-off length is obtained from
simulation results at different ambient temperature conditions and the
formation of intermediate species is captured by the simulations, indicating

The MAE also exhibits a strain dependence in the chromium trihalides: it
increases when a compressive strain is applied in CrI$_3$, while an opposite
trend is observed in the other two compounds. In particular, the MAE of CrI$_3$
can be increased by 47\% with a compressive strain of $\varepsilon$ = 5\%.

control of ionic distributions in (La,Sr)CoO$_{3}$ thin films. Depositing a Gd
capping layer on the perovskite film, oxygen is controllably extracted from the
structure, up-to 0.5 O/u.c. throughout the entire 36 nm thickness. Commensurate
with the oxygen extraction, the Co valence state and saturation magnetization
show a smooth continuous variation. In contrast, magnetoresistance measurements
show no-change in the magnetic anisotropy and a rapid increase in the
resistivity over the same range of oxygen stoichiometry. These results suggest
significant phase separation, with metallic ferromagnetic regions and
oxygen-deficient, insulating, non-ferromagnetic regions, forming percolated
networks. Indeed, X-ray diffraction identifies oxygen-vacancy ordering,
including transformation to a brownmillerite crystal structure. The unexpected
transformation to the brownmillerite phase at ambient temperature is further
confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy which
shows significant structural - and correspondingly chemical - phase separation.

is widely practiced. Reasons for doing so are primarily related to improving
enterprise security (e.g., malware detection) and meeting legal requirements.
To analyze TLS-encrypted data, network appliances implement a Man-in-the-Middle
TLS proxy, by acting as the intended web server to a requesting client (e.g., a
browser), and acting as the client to the outside web server. As such, the TLS
proxy must implement both a TLS client and a server, and handle a large amount
of traffic, preferably, in real-time. However, as protocol and implementation
layer vulnerabilities in TLS/HTTPS are quite frequent, these proxies must be,
at least, as secure as a modern, up-to-date web browser, and a properly
configured web server. As opposed to client-end TLS proxies (e.g., as in
several anti-virus products), the proxies in network appliances may serve
hundreds to thousands of clients, and any vulnerability in their TLS
implementations can significantly downgrade enterprise security.
  To analyze TLS security of network appliances, we develop a comprehensive
framework, by combining and extending tests from existing work on client-end
and network-based interception studies. We analyze thirteen representative
network appliances over a period of more than a year (including versions before
and after notifying affected vendors, a total of 17 versions), and uncover
several security issues. For instance, we found that four appliances perform no
certificate validation at all, three use pre-generated certificates, and eleven
accept certificates signed using MD5, exposing their clients to MITM attacks.
Our goal is to highlight the risks introduced by widely-used TLS proxies in
enterprise and government environments, potentially affecting many systems
hosting security, privacy, and financially sensitive data.

quantify volumes and shapes used in diagnosis and monitoring treatment;
registration of multimodality images of organs improves detection, diagnosis

registration of images obtained from the same modality are used to monitor
progression of therapy. These challenging clinical-motivated applications
introduce novel and sophisticated mathematical problems which stimulate
developments of advanced optimization and computing methods, especially convex
optimization attaining optimum in a global sense, hence, bring an enormous
spread of research topics for recent computational medical image analysis.

together with the electromagnetic counterpart showed that the speed of
gravitational waves $c_t$ is very close to that of light for the redshift
$z<0.009$. This places tight constraints on dark energy models constructed in
the framework of modified gravitational theories. We review models of the
late-time cosmic acceleration in scalar-tensor theories with second-order
equations of motion (dubbed Horndeski theories) by paying particular attention
to the evolution of dark energy equation of state and observables relevant to
the cosmic growth history. We provide a gauge-ready formulation of scalar
perturbations in full Horndeski theories and estimate observables associated
with the evolution of large-scale structures, cosmic microwave background, and
weak lensing by employing a so-called quasi-static approximation for the modes
deep inside the sound horizon.
  In light of the recent observational bound of $c_t$, we also classify
surviving dark energy models into four classes depending on different
structure-formation patterns and discuss how they can be observationally
distinguished from each other. In particular, the nonminimally coupled theories
in which the scalar field $\phi$ has a coupling with the Ricci scalar $R$ of
the form $G_4(\phi) R$, including $f(R)$ gravity, can be tightly constrained
not only from the cosmic expansion and growth histories but also from the
variation of screened gravitational couplings. The cross correlation of
integrated Sachs-Wolfe signal with galaxy distributions can be a key observable
for placing bounds on the relative ratio of cubic Galileon density to total
dark energy density. The dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy will open up a
new window to constrain nonminimally coupled theories further by the modified
luminosity distance of tensor perturbations.

white dwarfs are the result of close binary interaction and merging. Population
synthesis calculations have shown that the origin of isolated highly magnetic
white dwarfs is consistent with the stellar merging hypothesis. In this
picture, the observed fields are caused by an alpha-Omega dynamo driven by
differential rotation. The strongest fields arise when the differential
rotation equals the critical break-up velocity and result from the merging of
two stars (one of which has a degenerate core) during common envelope evolution
or from the merging of two white dwarfs. We now synthesise a population of
binary systems to investigate the hypothesis that the magnetic fields in the
magnetic cataclysmic variables also originate during stellar interaction in the
common envelope phase. Those systems that emerge from common envelope more
tightly bound form the cataclysmic variables with the strongest magnetic
fields. We vary the common envelope efficiency parameter and compare the
results of our population syntheses with observations of magnetic cataclysmic
variables. We find that common envelope interaction can explain the observed
characteristics of these magnetic systems if the envelope ejection efficiency
is low.

Our angle-resolved electrical measurements reveal that the Hall voltage changes

bias current is perpendicular (parallel) to the mirror line. The observed
effect can be understood as an AHE induced by the bias current which generates
an out-of-plane magnetization. The temperature dependence of the Hall

physical processes under different interaction regimes. In the ultrastrong

from the standard model and provides the same physical results obtained by
using the dipole gauge. It contains field operators to all orders that cannot

collected sparsely and irregularly in time while the data acquisition is
expensive and inconvenient. Examples include measurements of spine bone mineral
density, cancer growth through mammography or biopsy, a progression of
defective vision, or assessment of gait in patients with neurological
disorders. Since the data collection is often costly and inconvenient,
estimation of progression from sparse observations is of great interest for
practitioners.
  From the statistical standpoint, such data is often analyzed in the context
of a mixed-effect model where time is treated as both a fixed-effect
(population progression curve) and a random-effect (individual variability).
Alternatively, researchers analyze Gaussian processes or functional data where
observations are assumed to be drawn from a certain distribution of processes.
These models are flexible but rely on probabilistic assumptions, require very
careful implementation, specific to the given problem, and tend to be slow in
practice.
  In this study, we propose an alternative elementary framework for analyzing
longitudinal data, relying on matrix completion. Our method yields estimates of
progression curves by iterative application of the Singular Value
Decomposition. Our framework covers multivariate longitudinal data, regression,
and can be easily extended to other settings. As it relies on existing tools
for matrix algebra it is efficient and easy to implement.
  We apply our methods to understand trends of progression of motor impairment
in children with Cerebral Palsy. Our model approximates individual progression
curves and explains 30% of the variability. Low-rank representation of
progression trends enables identification of different progression trends in

Furthermore, for $l=2$, we show that both the Wehrl entropy and the angular
pseudoentropy can be expressed as functions of the squared chordal distance of
multipole vectors. We also show that the angular pseudoentropy can distinguish
between Gaussian and non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations at large multipoles
and henceforth provides a non-brute-force method for identifying
non-Gaussianities. This allows us to study possible hints of statistical
anisotropy and non-Gaussianity in the CMB up to multipole $l=1000$ using Planck

not noticed the robot are the most difficult to predict. This paper
investigates how mobile robots can generate acceptable paths in dynamic
environments by predicting human behavior. Here, human behavior may include
both physical and mental behavior, we focus on the latter. We introduce a
simple safe interaction model: when a human seems unaware of the robot, it
should avoid going too close. In this study, people around robots are detected
and tracked using sensor fusion and filtering techniques. To handle
uncertainties in the dynamic environment, a Partially-Observable Markov
Decision Process Model (POMDP) is used to formulate a navigation planning
problem in the shared environment. People's awareness of robots is inferred and
included as a state and reward model in the POMDP. The proposed planner enables
a robot to change its navigation plan based on its perception of each person's
robot-awareness. As far as we can tell, this is a new capability. We conduct
simulation and experiments using the Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR) to

improve other hashing based methods for MIPS. To support efficient query

experiment on rats that studied the impact of stroke on the connectivity
structure (dependence) between local field potentials recorded at various

can detect any changepoint in the regime of a brain channel for a given
frequency band based on a difference between the cumulative distribution
functions modeled for each epoch (small window of time). Our proposed approach
is an iterative algorithm which compares each successive bivariate copulas on
all the epochs range, using a bivariate Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Second,
we ask whether stroke can alter the dependence structure of brain signals; and
examine whether changes in dependence are present only in some channels or
generalized across channels. These questions are addressed by comparing
Vine-copulas models fitted for each epoch. We provide the necessary framework
and show the effectiveness of our methods through the results for the local
field potential data analysis of a rat.

instability in Poiseuille flows with fluids close to their vapour-liquid
critical point. Close to this critical point, the ideal gas assumption does not
hold and large non-ideal fluid behaviours occur. As a representative non-ideal
fluid, we consider supercritical carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) at pressure of 80 bar,
which is above its critical pressure of 73.9 bar. The Poiseuille flow is
characterized by the Reynolds number
($Re=\rho_{w}^{*}u_{r}^{*}h^{*}/\mu_{w}^{*}$), the product of Prandtl
($Pr=\mu_{w}^{*}C_{pw}^{*}/\kappa_{w}^{*}$) and Eckert number
($Ec=u_{r}^{*2}/C_{pw}^{*}T_{w}^{*}$), and the wall temperature that in
addition to pressure determines the thermodynamic reference condition. For low
Eckert numbers, the flow is essentially isothermal and no difference with the
well-known stability behaviour of incompressible flows is observed. However, if
the Eckert number increases, the viscous heating causes gradients of
thermodynamic and transport properties, and non-ideal gas effects become
significant. Three regimes of the laminar base flow can be considered,
subcritical (temperature in the channel is entirely below its pseudo-critical
value), transcritical, and supercritical temperature regime. If compared to the
linear stability of an ideal gas Poiseuille flow, we show that the base flow is
more unstable in the subcritical regime, inviscid unstable in the transcritical
regime, while significantly more stable in the supercritical regime. Following
the corresponding states principle, we expect that qualitatively similar
results will be obtained for other fluids at equivalent thermodynamic states.

three implementable stopping rules with similar performances are explored, and
the simplest of these is shown to asymptotically achieve the oracle-aided trial

architecture (CDNA) where primary users (PUs) are rewarded for sharing their
connectivities and acting as access points for secondary users (SUs). CDNA
creates opportunities for capacity increase by network-wide harvesting of
unused data plans and spectrum from different operators. Different policies for
data and spectrum trading are presented based on centralized, hybrid and
distributed schemes involving primary operator (PO), secondary operator (SO)
and their respective end users. In these schemes, PO and SO progressively
delegate trading to their end users and adopt more flexible cooperation
agreements to reduce computational time and track available resources
dynamically. A novel matching-with-pricing algorithm is presented to enable
self-organized SU-PU associations, channel allocation and pricing for data and
spectrum with low computational complexity. Since connectivity is provided by
the actual users, the success of the underlying collaborative market relies on
the trustworthiness of the connections. A behavioral-based access control
mechanism is developed to incentivize/penalize honest/dishonest behavior and
create a trusted collaborative network. Numerical results show that the
computational time of the hybrid scheme is one order of magnitude faster than
the benchmark centralized scheme and that the matching algorithm reconfigures
the network up to three orders of magnitude faster than in the centralized

operations a processor performs. The correctness of these operations is
therefore essential for the proper execution of any program. However, as soon
as fault attacks are considered, assuming that the hardware performs its memory
operations as instructed is not valid anymore. In particular, attackers may
induce faults with the goal of reading or writing incorrectly addressed memory,
which can have various critical safety and security implications.
  In this work, we present a solution to this problem and propose a new method
for protecting every memory access inside a program against address tampering.
The countermeasure comprises two building blocks. First, every pointer inside
the program is redundantly encoded using a multi-residue error detection code.
The redundancy information is stored in the unused upper bits of the pointer
with zero overhead in terms of storage. Second, load and store instructions are
extended to link data with the corresponding encoded address from the pointer.
Wrong memory accesses subsequently infect the data value allowing the software
to detect the error.
  For evaluation purposes, we implemented our countermeasure into a RISC-V
processor, tested it on a FPGA development board, and evaluated the induced
overhead. Furthermore, a LLVM-based C compiler has been modified to
automatically encode all data pointers, to perform encoded pointer arithmetic,
and to emit the extended load/store instructions with linking support. Our
evaluations show that the countermeasure induces an average overhead of 10% in
terms of code size and 7% regarding runtime, which makes it suitable for
practical adoption.

reasoning over functions. Despite appealing theory, its superlinear
computational and memory complexities have presented a long-standing challenge.
State-of-the-art sparse variational inference methods trade modeling accuracy
against complexity. However, the complexities of these methods still scale
superlinearly in the number of basis functions, implying that that sparse GP
methods are able to learn from large datasets only when a small model is used.
Recently, a decoupled approach was proposed that removes the unnecessary
coupling between the complexities of modeling the mean and the covariance
functions of a GP. It achieves a linear complexity in the number of mean
parameters, so an expressive posterior mean function can be modeled. While
promising, this approach suffers from optimization difficulties due to
ill-conditioning and non-convexity. In this work, we propose an alternative
decoupled parametrization. It adopts an orthogonal basis in the mean function
to model the residues that cannot be learned by the standard coupled approach.
Therefore, our method extends, rather than replaces, the coupled approach to

memory bandwidth requirements of multi-core processors. Manufacturing
technology has enabled stacking several gigabytes of DRAM modules on the active
die, thereby providing orders of magnitude higher bandwidth as compared to the
conventional DIMM-based DDR memories. Nevertheless, die-stacked DRAM, due to
its limited capacity, cannot accommodate entire datasets of modern big-data
applications. Therefore, prior proposals use it either as a sizable memory-side
cache or as a part of the software-visible main memory. Cache designs can adapt
themselves to the dynamic variations of applications but suffer from the tag
storage/latency/bandwidth overhead. On the other hand, memory designs eliminate
the need for tags, and hence, provide efficient access to data, but are unable
to capture the dynamic behaviors of applications due to their static nature.
  In this work, we make a case for using the die-stacked DRAM partly as main
memory and partly as a cache. We observe that in modern big-data applications
there are many hot pages with a large number of accesses. Based on this
observation, we propose to use a portion of the die-stacked DRAM as main memory
to host hot pages, enabling serving a significant number of the accesses from
the high-bandwidth DRAM without the overhead of tag-checking, and manage the
rest of the DRAM as a cache, for capturing the dynamic behavior of
applications. In this proposal, a software procedure pre-processes the
application and determines hot pages, then asks the OS to map them to the
memory portion of the die-stacked DRAM. The cache portion of the die-stacked
DRAM is managed by hardware, caching data allocated in the off-chip memory.

for a disk-integrated observation of present-day Earth. Here we show that the
strength of Earth's VRE has increased over the past ~500 million years of land
plant evolution and may continue to increase as solar luminosity increases and
the planet warms, until either vegetation coverage is reduced, or the planet's
atmosphere becomes opaque to light reflected off the surface. Early plants like
mosses and liverworts, which dominated on land 500-400 million years ago,
produce a weaker VRE, approximately half as strong as that of modern
vegetation. We explore how the changes in land plants, as well as geological
changes like ice coverage during ice-ages and interglacial periods, influence
the detectability of the VRE through Earth's geological past. Our results show
that the VRE has varied through the evolutionary history of land plants on
Earth, and could continue to change into the future if hotter climate
conditions became dominant, encouraging the spread of vegetation. Our findings
suggest that older and hotter Earth-like planets are good targets for the
search for a VRE signature. In addition, hot exoplanets and dry exoplanets with
some water could be the best targets for a successful vegetation biosignature
detection. As well as a strong red edge, lower cloud-fractions and low levels

heating due to momentum diffusion, with no significant contribution from

scattering rate does not go to zero even for stationary molecules because of
the transient nature of the dark states.

price auction is a weakly dominant strategy. The result, however, does not
apply in the presence of Cost Per Action (CPA) constraints. Such constraints
exist, for instance, in digital advertising, as some buyer may try to maximize
the total number of clicks while keeping the empirical Cost Per Click (CPC)
below a threshold. More generally the CPA constraint implies that the buyer has
a maximal average cost per unit of value in mind.
  We discuss how such constraints change some traditional results from auction
theory.
  Following the usual textbook narrative on auction theory, we focus
specifically on the symmetric setting, We formalize the notion of CPA
constrained auctions and derive a Nash equilibrium for second price auctions.
We then extend this result to combinations of first and second price auctions.
Further, we expose a revenue equivalence property and show that the seller's
revenue-maximizing reserve price is zero.
  In practice, CPA-constrained buyers may target an empirical CPA on a given
time horizon, as the auction is repeated many times. Thus his bidding behavior
depends on past realization. We show that the resulting buyer dynamic

discuss possible ways of improvement by using prior information. A second
approach is based on phase closure of the DM commands and assumes the
continuity of the correction wavefront over the entire unsegmented pupil. The
last approach is based on the pair-wise slaving of edge actuators and shows the
best results. We compare the performance of these methods using realistic
end-to-end simulations. We find that pair-wise slaving leads to a small
increase of the total wavefront error, only adding between 20-45 nm RMS in
quadrature for seeing conditions between 0.45-0.85 arcsec. Finally, we discuss
the possibility of combining the different proposed solutions to increase
robustness.

The extended topologies involve three additional transcription regulatory

positive feedback loops. This increases the number of variables to six, and
extends the complexity of the equations in the model. To perform our analysis
we had to use combinations of modern symbolic algorithms of computer algebra
systems Mathematica and Singular. The study shows that all the three models
have simple dynamics what can also be called regular behaviour: they have a
single asymptotically stable steady state with small amplitude oscillations in
the 3D case and no oscillation in one of the 6D cases and damping oscillation
in the second 6D case. Using the program QeHopf we were able to exclude the

can produce a summary based on what is important for that domain in addition to
possessing other desired characteristics like representativeness, coverage,

on using supervised approaches for ranking the snippets to produce summary or
on using unsupervised approaches of generating the summary as a subset of
snippets with the above characteristics. We look at the joint problem of
learning domain specific importance of segments as well as the desired summary
characteristic for that domain. Our studies show that the more efficient way of
incorporating domain specific relevances into a summary is by obtaining ratings
of shots as opposed to binary inclusion/exclusion information. We also argue
that ratings can be seen as unified representation of all possible ground truth

novel evaluation measure which is more naturally suited in assessing the
quality of video summary for the task at hand than F1 like measures. It

the pattern graph is fixed. The earliest known example of an improvement over
trivial algorithms is by Itai and Rodeh (1978) who sped up triangle detection
in graphs using fast matrix multiplication. This algorithm was generalized by
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Poljak (1985) to speed up detection of k-cliques.
  Improved algorithms are known for certain small-sized patterns. For example,
a linear-time algorithm is known for detecting length-4 paths. In this paper,
we give the first pattern detection algorithm that improves upon
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Poljak's algorithm for arbitrarily large pattern graphs
(not cliques). The algorithm is obtained by reducing the induced subgraph
isomorphism problem to the problem of detecting multilinear terms in
constant-degree polynomials.
  We show that the same technique can be used to reduce the induced subgraph
isomorphism problem of many pattern graphs to constructing arithmetic circuits
computing homomorphism polynomials of these pattern graphs. Using this, we
obtain faster combinatorial algorithms (algorithms that do not use fast matrix
multiplication) for k-paths and k-cycles. We also obtain faster algorithms for
5-paths and 5-cycles that match the runtime for triangle detection.
  We show that these algorithms are expressible using polynomial families that
we call graph pattern polynomial families. We then define a notion of reduction
among these polynomials that allows us to compare the complexity of various
pattern detection problems within this framework. For example, we show that the

K\""ahler manifold $X$ with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature, we
study a morphism $\phi: X \to Y$ to a compact K\""ahler manifold $Y$ with
pseudo-effective canonical bundle. We prove that the morphism $\phi$ is always
smooth (that is, a submersion), the image $Y$ admits a finite etale cover $T
\to Y$ by a complex torus $T$, and further that all the fibers are isomorphic
when $X$ is projective. Moreover, by applying a modified method to maximal
rationally connected fibrations, we show that $X$ is rationally connected, if
$X$ is projective and $X$ has no truly flat tangent vectors at some point
(which is satisfied when the holomorphic sectional curvature is
quasi-positive). This result gives a generalization of Yau's conjecture. As a
further application, we obtain a uniformization theorem for compact K\""ahler
surfaces with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature.

of data that need to be processed and aggregated into useful biological models.
Building dynamical models based on this wealth of data is of paramount

However, building models manually for each data set is inconvenient and might
become infeasible for highly complex synthetic systems. In this paper, we
present state-of-the-art system identification techniques and combine them with
chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) to generate dynamic models
automatically. On the system identification side, Sparse Bayesian Learning
offers methods to learn from data the sparsest set of dictionary functions
necessary to capture the dynamics of the system into ODE models; on the CRNT
side, building on such sparse ODE models, all possible network structures
within a given parameter uncertainty region can be computed. Additionally, the
system identification process can be complemented with constraints on the
parameters to, for example, enforce stability or non-negativity---thus offering
relevant physical constraints over the possible network structures. In this
way, the wealth of data can be translated into biologically relevant network
structures, which then steers the data acquisition, thereby providing a vital
step for closed-loop system identification.

rocket experiment that on 3rd September 2015 measured the linear polarization
produced by scattering processes in the hydrogen Ly-$\alpha$ line of the solar
disk radiation, whose line-center photons stem from the chromosphere-corona
transition region (TR). These unprecedented spectropolarimetric observations
revealed an interesting surprise, namely that there is practically no
center-to-limb variation (CLV) in the $Q/I$ line-center signals. Using an
analytical model, we first show that the geometrical complexity of the
corrugated surface that delineates the TR has a crucial impact on the CLV of
the $Q/I$ and $U/I$ line-center signals. Secondly, we introduce a statistical
description of the solar atmosphere based on a three-dimensional (3D) model
derived from a state-of-the-art radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. Each
realization of the statistical ensemble is a 3D model characterized by a given
degree of magnetization and corrugation of the TR, and for each such
realization we solve the full 3D radiative transfer problem taking into account
the impact of the CLASP instrument degradation on the calculated polarization
signals. Finally, we apply the statistical inference method presented in a
previous paper to show that the TR of the 3D model that produces the best
agreement with the CLASP observations has a relatively weak magnetic field and
a relatively high degree of corrugation. We emphasize that a suitable way to
validate or refute numerical models of the upper solar chromosphere is by
confronting calculations and observations of the scattering polarization in
ultraviolet lines sensitive to the Hanle effect.

static soft traps : each time it meets a trap the walk is killed with
probability 1--e --$\beta$ , where $\beta$ is a positive and fixed parameter.
The positions of the traps are sampled independently from the walk and
according to a renewal process. The increments between consecutive traps, or
gaps, are assumed to have a power-law decaying tail with exponent $\gamma$ > 0.
We prove convergence in law for the properly rescaled logarithm of the quenched
survival probability as time goes to infinity. The normalization exponent is
$\gamma$/($\gamma$ + 2), while the limiting law writes as a variational formula
with both universal and non-universal features. The latter involves (i) a
Poisson point process that emerges as the universal scaling limit of the
properly rescaled gaps and (ii) a function of the parameter $\beta$ that we
call asymptotic cost of crossing per trap and that may, in principle, depend on
the details of the gap distribution. Our proof suggests a confinement strategy
of the walk in a single large gap. This model may also be seen as a (1 +
1)-directed polymer among many repulsive interfaces, in which case $\beta$
corresponds to the strength of repulsion, the survival probability to the
partition function and its logarithm to the finite-volume free energy. Along
the way we prove a stochastic monotonicity property for the hitting time of the
killed random walk with respect to the non-killed one, that could be of
interest in other contexts, see Proposition 3.5.

It appeared that the time of transmission of an electron wave packet through
the Dirac bubble potential sphere that simulates a real potential of the C60

The lower intensity suppresses optical field ionization and creation of the

enhanced efficient vacuum heating of the plasma. The lower critical plasma
density for long-wavelength radiation can be surmounted by using nanowires

Typically these practices use inter-annotator agreement as a measure of

in the data, as well as a multitude of perspectives of the information
examples. We present an empirically derived methodology for efficiently
gathering of ground truth data in a diverse set of use cases covering a variety

CrowdTruth metrics that capture inter-annotator disagreement. We show that
measuring disagreement is essential for acquiring a high quality ground truth.
We achieve this by comparing the quality of the data aggregated with CrowdTruth
metrics with majority vote, over a set of diverse crowdsourcing tasks: Medical

study the evolution of a population under various effects. Our object of study
will be the Simpson index which measures the level of diversity of the
population, one of the key parameter for ecologists who study for example
forest dynamics. Following ecological motivations, we will consider here the
case where there are various species with fitness and immigration parameters
being random processes (and thus time evolving). To measure biodiversity,
ecologists generally use the Simpson index, who has no closed formula, except
in the neutral (no selection) case via a backward approach, and which is
difficult to evaluate even numerically when the population size is large. Our
approach relies on the large population limit in the ""weak"" selection case, and
thus to give a procedure which enable us to approximate, with controlled rate,
the expectation of the Simpson index at fixed time. Our approach will be
forward and valid for all time, which is the main difference with the
historical approach of Kingman, or Krone-Neuhauser. We will also study the long
time behaviour of the Wright-Fisher process in a simplified setting, allowing
us to get a full picture for the approximation of the expectation of the

to the absence of multistationarity in 160 networks over 506. The short
computation times obtained in this graphical approach are in sharp contrast to
the Jacobian-based symbolic computation approach. We also discuss the case of
one extra graphical condition by arc rewiring that allows us to conclude on 20

demonstrate exponential decay of the particle amplitudes from the core to their

smooth decay and amplitudes of the particles form approximately a decreasing

nonlinearity (the frequency decreases with increasing of amplitudes) and they

charm-strange states $D_{s0}^\ast (2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, do not conform
with the conventional quark model expectations and raise various puzzles in
charm meson spectroscopy. We demonstrate that those puzzles find a natural
solution thanks to the recent development of chiral effective theory and
Lattice simulations. The existence of the $D_{s0}^\ast (2317)$ and
$D_{s1}(2460)$ are attributed to the nonperturbative dynamics of Goldstone
bosons scattering off $D$ and $D^\ast$ mesons. It indicates that the lowest
positive parity nonstrange scalar charm mesons, the $D_0^\ast(2400)$ in the
Review of Particel Physics, should be replaced by two states. The well
constructed amplitudes are fully in line with the high quality data on the
decays $B^-\to D^+\pi^-\pi^-$ and $D_s^0\to \bar{D}^0K^-\pi^+$. This implies
that the lowest positve-parity states are dynamically generated rather than
conventional quark-antiquark states. This pattern has also been established for
the scalar and axial-vector mesons made from light quarks ($u$, $d$ and $s$

Field Unit (X-IFU) on board the next-generation European X-ray observatory
Athena (2030s) will provide the necessary leap forward in spatially-resolved
spectroscopy required to disentangle the intricate mechanisms responsible for
this chemical enrichment. In this paper, we investigate the future capabilities
of the X-IFU in probing the hot gas within galaxy clusters. From a test sample
of four clusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we
present comprehensive synthetic observations of these clusters at different
redshifts (up to z = 2) and within the scaled radius R500 performed using the
instrument simulator SIXTE. Through 100 ks exposures, we demonstrate that the
X-IFU will provide spatially-resolved mapping of the ICM physical properties
with little to no biases (<5%) and well within statistical uncertainties. The
detailed study of abundance profiles and abundance ratios within R500 also
highlights the power of the X-IFU in providing constraints on the various
enrichment models. From synthetic observations out to z = 2, we also quantify
its ability to track the chemical elements across cosmic time with excellent
accuracy, and thereby to investigate the evolution of metal production
mechanisms as well as the link to the stellar initial mass-function. Our study
demonstrates the unprecedented capabilities of the X-IFU in unveiling the
properties of the ICM but also stresses the data analysis challenges faced by
future high-resolution X-ray missions such as Athena.

frequency spectra of solar-like pulsators, enabling us to probe stellar
interiors with a very high degree of accuracy by comparing the observed and
modeled frequencies. However, the frequencies computed with 1D models suffer
from systematic errors related to the poor modeling of the uppermost layers of
stars. These biases are what is commonly named the near surface effect. The
dominant effect is related to the turbulent pressure that modifies the
hydrostatic equilibrium and thus the frequencies. This has already been
investigated using grids of 3D RMHD simulations, which also were used to
constrain the parameters of the empirical correction models. However, the
effect of metallicity has not been considered so far. We study the impact of
metallicity on the surface effect across the HR diagram, and provide a method
for accounting for it when using the empirical correction models. We computed a
grid of patched 1D stellar models with the stellar evolution code CESTAM in
which poorly modeled surface layers have been replaced by averaged
stratification computed with the 3D RMHD code CO5BOLD. We found that
metallicity has a strong impact on the surface effect: keeping T_eff and log g
constant, the frequency residuals can vary by up to a factor two. Therefore,
the influence of metallicity cannot be neglected. We found that a correct way
of accounting for it is to consider the surface Rosseland mean opacity. It
allowed us to give a physically-grounded justification as well as a scaling
relation for the frequency differences at nu_max as a function of T_eff, log g
and kappa. Finally, we provide prescriptions for the fitting parameters of the
correction functions. We show that the impact of metallicity through the
Rosseland mean opacity must be taken into account when studying and correcting
the surface effect.

turbulent pipe flow. Wetted superhydrophobic surfaces are shown to trap gas
bubbles in their asperities. This stops the liquid from coming in direct
contact with the wall in that location, allowing the flow to slip over the air
bubbles. We consider a well defined texture with streamwise grooves at the
walls in which the gas is expected to be entrapped. This configuration is
modelled with alternating no-slip and shear-free boundary conditions at the
wall. With respect to classical turbulent pipe flow, a substantial drag
reduction is observed which strongly depends on the grooves' dimension and on
the solid fraction, i.e. the ratio between the solid wall surface and the total
surface of the pipe's circumference. The drag reduction is due to the mean slip
velocity at the wall which increases the flow rate at a fixed pressure drop.
The enforced boundary conditions also produce peculiar turbulent structures
which on the contrary decrease the flow rate. The two concurrent effects
provide an overall flow rate increase as demonstrated by means of the mean
axial momentum balance. This equation provides the balance between the mean
pressure gradient, the Reynolds stress, the mean flow rate and the mean slip
velocity contributions.

quantification using fast dual-echo steady-state (DESS) scans and machine
learning with kernels.
  Methods: We optimized combinations of steady-state (SS) scans for precisely
estimating the fast-relaxing signal fraction ff of a two-compartment signal
model, subject to a scan time constraint. We estimated ff from the optimized
DESS acquisition using a recently developed method for rapid parameter
estimation via regression with kernels (PERK). We compared DESS PERK ff
estimates to conventional myelin water fraction (MWF) estimates from a longer
multi-echo spin-echo (MESE) acquisition in simulation, in vivo, and ex vivo
studies.
  Results: Simulations demonstrate that DESS PERK ff estimators and MESE MWF
estimators achieve comparable error levels. In vivo and ex vivo experiments
demonstrate that MESE MWF and DESS PERK ff estimates are quantitatively
comparable measures of WM myelin water content. To our knowledge, these
experiments are the first to demonstrate myelin water images from a SS
acquisition that are quantitatively similar to conventional MESE MWF images.
  Conclusion: Combinations of fast DESS scans can be designed to enable precise
ff estimation. PERK is well-suited for ff estimation. DESS PERK ff and MESE MWF
estimates are quantitatively similar measures of WM myelin water content.

The asymptotic expansion we obtain extends a previously known result for a
single isolated object and applies in situations where the object sizes are
small and the objects are sufficiently well separated. We also obtain a second
expansion that describes the perturbed magnetic field for inhomogeneous and
closely spaced objects, which again characterises the objects by a complex
symmetric rank 2 tensor. The tensor's coefficients can be computed by solving a
vector valued transmission problem and we include numerical examples to
illustrate the agreement between the asymptotic formula describing the

between interacting agents initiate excessive collective expectations about a
new idea or an innovation, followed by a swift collapse towards a dramatic
collective disillusionment. The basic assumption which underlies the dynamics
is that the information gathering process is not instantaneous but requires
maturation. Agents steadily refine and update their personal opinion via a
recurrent consultation of a public pool which stores information tokens (ITs).
The expectation for the innovative idea is monitored in real-time by counting
the number of stored ITs. The flow dynamics of ITs is assimilated to a single
node queuing system (QS) with feedback loop. It incorporates the information
pool (the waiting room), an IT inflow, and a service outflow that stylizes the
information gathering process. Contrary to basic queuing theory, here the ITs
roaming the QS are endowed with time-dependent internal variables. This
additional dynamic information is used to construct the information maturation
process. Such a maturation of the information introduces response delays into
the dynamics, which ultimately generates the collective disillusionment trough.
We illustrate the introduced generic modeling framework by considering in
details the hype cycle dynamics, a key managerial topic when dealing with
diffusion of innovation. In a second part of the paper, we introduce a stylized
framework to detect, as soon as possible, the onset of the collective
disillusionment phase, while minimizing the frequency of false alarms.

present a numerical model to interpret the unusual magnetic-field behavior in

required for scalable quantum computing with neutral atoms. Their realization,
however, meets a major stumbling block -- the motion-induced dephasing of the
transition between the ground and Rydberg states. By using quantum interference
between different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme to
realize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a
minimal dephasing error. We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$,
in the form of $\text{diag}\{1, e^{i\alpha}, e^{i\gamma}, e^{i\beta}\}$, where
$\alpha, \gamma$, and $\beta$ are determined by the parameters of lasers and
the Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a
single off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually
applying one pulse of detuned laser to each qubit. Our method has several
advantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is
limited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.
Decay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all
transitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.
Second, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time
in which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.
Third, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the
three phases $\alpha,\gamma$, and $\beta$, only the last has a (partial)
dependence on $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are of
similar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of
them are of the feasible magnitude of several megahertz. The rapidity,
accuracy, and feasibility of this interference method can lay the foundation
for entangling gates in universal quantum computing with neutral atoms.

observed stars and a laboratory of fundamental physics helping us understand
processes occuring in conditions irreproducible on Earth. However, our
understanding of the Sun is currently stained by the solar modelling problem
which can stem from various causes, such as the opacities, the equation of
state and the mixing of chemical elements. We combine inversions of sound
speed, an entropy proxy and the Ledoux discriminant with constraints such as
the position of the base of the convective zone and the photospheric helium
abundance. We test various combinations of standard ingredients for solar
modelling such as abundance tables, equation of state, formalism for convection
and diffusion and opacity tables and study the diagnostic potential of the
inversions to constrain ad-hoc modifications of the opacity profile and
additional mixing below the convective envelope. Combining inversions provides
stringent constraints on the modifications on the models, far beyond what is
achievable only from sound speed inversions. We constrain the form and
amplitude of the opacity increase required and show that a 15% increase at log
T=6.35 provides a significant improvement but that a more global increase of
the opacity, within the uncertainties of current tables, coupled with an
additional mixing at the bottom of the convective zone gives the best agreement
for low metallicity models. We show that high metallicity models do not satisfy
all the inversion results. We conclude that the solar problem likely occurs
from various small sources, as ingredients such as the equation of state or the
formalism of convection can induce small but significant changes and that using
phase shift analyses combined with our approach is the next step for a better
understanding of the inaccuracies of solar models just below the convective
envelope.

site-dependent variability can mask the advantages of these multi-site studies.
The aim of this study was to assess multi-site reproducibility in resting-state
functional connectivity fingerprints, and to improve identifiability of
functional connectomes. The individual fingerprinting of functional
connectivity profiles is promising due to its potential as a robust
neuroimaging biomarker. We evaluated, on two independent multi-site datasets,
individual fingerprints in test-retest visit pairs within and across two sites
and present a generalized framework based on principal component analysis to
improve identifiability. Those components that maximized differential
identifiability of a training dataset were used as an orthogonal connectivity
basis to reconstruct the functional connectomes of training and validation
sets. The optimally reconstructed functional connectomes showed a substantial
improvement in individual fingerprinting within and across the two sites
relative to the original data. A notable increase in ICC values for functional
edges and resting-state networks was also observed. Improvements in
identifiability were not found to be affected by global signal regression.
Post-hoc analyses assessed the effect of the number of fMRI volumes on
identifiability and showed that multi-site differential identifiability was for
all cases maximized after optimal reconstruction. The generalizability of the
optimal set of orthogonal basis of each dataset was evaluated through a
leave-one-out procedure. Overall, results demonstrate that the framework
presented in this study systematically improves identifiability in
resting-state functional connectomes in multi-site studies.

early-type dwarf galaxy, named NGC7796-DW1. It exhibits a tidal tail, very boxy
isophotes, and multiple nuclei or regions (A, B, and C) that are bluer than the
bulk population of the galaxy, indicating a younger age. These properties are
suggestive of a dwarf-dwarf merger remnant. We use the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) at the VLT to investigate NGC 7796-DW1. We extract
characteristic spectra to which we apply the STARLIGHT population synthesis
software to obtain ages and metallicities of the various population components
of the galaxy. The galaxy's main body is old and metal-poor. A surprising
result is the extended line emission in the galaxy, forming a ring-like
structure with a projected diameter of 2.2 kpc. The line ratios fall into the
regime of HII-regions, although OB-stellar populations cannot be identified by
spectral signatures. Nucleus A is a relatively old (7 Gyr or older) and
metal-poor super star cluster, most probably the nucleus of the dwarf, now
displaced. The star-forming regions B and C show younger and distinctly more
metal-rich components. The emission line ratios of regions B and C indicate an
almost solar oxygen abundance, if compared with radiation models of HII
regions. NGC7796-DW1 occupies a particular role in the group of transition-type
galaxies with respect to its origin and current evolutionary state, being the
companion of an IE. The dwarf-dwarf merger scenario is excluded because of the
missing metal-rich merger component. A viable alternative is gas accretion from
a reservoir of cold, metal-rich gas. NGC7796 has to provide this gas within its
X-ray bright halo. As illustrated by NGC7796-DW1, cold accretion may be a
general solution to the problem of extended star formation histories in
transition dwarf galaxies. (abridged)

technology demonstration payload that operated from January 2016 through July
of 2017 on the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder spacecraft. The joint
goal of the NASA and ESA missions was to validate key technologies for a future
space-based gravitational wave observatory targeting the source-rich milliHertz
band. The two primary components of ST7-DRS are a micropropulsion system based
on colloidal micro-Newton thrusters (CMNTs) and a control system that
simultaneously controls the attitude and position of the spacecraft and the two
free-flying test masses (TMs). This paper presents our main experimental
results and summarizes the overall the performance of the CMNTs and control
laws. We find that the CMNT performance to be consistent with pre-flight
predictions, with a measured system thrust noise on the order of
$100\,\textrm{nN}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in the $1\,\textrm{mHz}\leq f \leq
30\,\textrm{mHz}$ band. The control system maintained the TM-spacecraft
separation with an RMS error of less than 2$\,$nm and a noise spectral density
of less than $3\,\textrm{nm}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in the same band. Thruster
calibration measurements yield thrust values consistent with the performance
model and ground-based thrust-stand measurements, to within a few percent. We
also report a differential acceleration noise between the two test masses with
a spectral density of roughly $3\,\textrm{fm}/\textrm{s}^2/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$
in the $1\,\textrm{mHz}\leq f \leq 30\,\textrm{mHz}$ band, slightly less than
twice as large as the best performance reported with the baseline LISA

known to feature certain peculiarities, such as infrared hyperconductivity for
light bosons in weak electric fields. Moreover, negative conductivity has been
claimed to occur for light bosons in moderate electric fields, and for fermions
of any mass in electric fields below a certain threshold. Furthemore, in the
limit of large mass and weak electric field, the current contains terms which
are not exponentially suppressed, contrary to the semiclassical intuition. Here
we explain these behaviors, showing that most of the reported negative
conductivity is spurious. First, we show that the terms which are not
exponentially suppressed follow precisely from the local Euler-Heisenberg
Lagrangian (suitably generalized to curved space). Thus, such terms are
unrelated to pair creation or to the transport of electric charge. Rather, they
correspond to non-linearities of the electric field (responsible in particular
for vacuum birefringence). The remaining contributions are exponentially
suppressed and correspond to the creation of Schwinger pairs. Second, we argue
that for light carriers the negative term in the regularized current does not
correspond to a negative conductivity, but to the logarithmic running of the
electric coupling constant, up to the high energy Hubble scale. We conclude
that none of the above mentioned negative contributions can cause an
instability such as the spontaneous growth of an electric field in de Sitter,
at least within the weak coupling regime. Third, we provide a heuristic
derivation of infrared hyperconductivity, which clarifies its possible role in
magnetogenesis scenarios.

uses univariate frequency representations tailored towards user-pre-defined

interpolation problem, not to multi-dimensional interpolation as for the
multivariate approaches, i.e., it also involves fewer interpolation frequencies
to be chosen. Comparing to former contributions towards nonlinear model
reduction with univariate frequency representations, our approach shows
profound differences: Our derivation is more rigorous and general and reveals
additional tensor-structured approximation conditions, which should be
incorporated. Moreover, the proposed implementation exploits the inherent
low-rank tensor structure, which enhances its efficiency. In addition, our
approach allows for the incorporation of more general input relations in the
state equations - not only affine-linear ones as in existing system-theoretic
methods - in an elegant way. As a byproduct of the latter, also a novel
modification for the multivariate methods falls off, which is able to handle
more general input-relations.

magnetograms from MDI/SoHO and HMI/SDO. Our aim is to use uniform datasets and

Included are measurements of the magnetic tilt angles, areas, fluxes and
polarity pole separations for 4385 sunspot groups in Cycles 23 and 24 each
measured, on average, at $\sim$66 epochs centered on meridian-crossing. The
sunspots are classified as either ""Hale"" or ""anti-Hale"", depending on whether
their polarities align or anti-align with Hale's hemispheric polarity rule. We
find that (1) The ""anti-Hale"" sunspots constitute a fraction ($8.1\pm0.4$)\% of
all sunspots, and this fraction is the same in both hemispheres and cycles, (2)
""Hale"" sunspots obey Joy's law in both hemispheres and cycles but ""anti-Hale""
sunspots do not. Three equivalent forms of Joy's law are derived,
$\sin\gamma=(0.38\pm0.05)\sin\phi$, $\gamma=(0.39\pm0.06)\phi$, and
$\gamma=(23.80\pm3.51)\sin\phi$, where $\gamma$ is the tilt angle and $\phi$ is
the heliospheric latitude, (3) The average Hale sunspot tilt angle is
$\overline{\gamma} = 5.49^\circ\pm0.09$, (4) The tilt angles, magnetic fluxes
and pole separations of sunspots are interrelated, with larger fluxes
correlated with larger pole separations and smaller tilt angles. We present
empirical relations between these quantities. Cycle 24 is a much weaker cycle
than Cycle 23 in sunspot numbers, cumulative magnetic flux, and average sunspot
magnetic flux. The ""anti-Hale"" sunspots are also much weaker than ""Hale""
sunspots in those parameters, but they share similar magnetic flux
distributions and average latitudes. We characterize the two populations, and

The first attempt to understand this difference suggested that division leading
to one of the fragments being near doubly magic $^{132}$Sn is favored by gain
in binding energy. After the Strutinsky shell-correction method was developed
an alternative idea that gained popularity was that the fission saddle might be
lower for mass-asymmetric shapes and that this asymmetry was preserved until
scission. Recently it was observed [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105} (2010) 252502]
that $^{180}$Hg preferentially fissions asymmetrically in contradiction to the
fragment-magic-shell expectation which suggested symmetric division peaked
around $^{90}$Zr, with its magic neutron number $N=50$, so it was presented as
a ""new type of asymmetric fission"". However, in a paper [Phys. Lett. 34B (1971)
349] a ""simple"" microscopic mechanism behind the asymmetry of the actinide
fission saddle points was proposed to be related the coupling between levels of
type [40$\Lambda\Omega$] and [51$\Lambda\Omega$]. The paper then generalizes
this idea and made the remarkable prediction that analogous features could
exist in other regions. In particular it was proposed that in the rare-earth
region couplings between levels of type [30$\Lambda\Omega$] and
[41$\Lambda\Omega$] would favor mass-asymmetric outer saddle shapes. In this
picture the asymmetry of $^{180}$Hg is not a ""new type of asymmetric fission""
but of analogous origin as the asymmetry of actinide fission. This prediction
has never been cited in the discussion of the recently observed fission
asymmetries in the ""new region of asymmetry"", in nuclear physics also referred
to as the rare-earth region. We show by detailed analysis that the mechanism of
the saddle asymmetry in the sub-Pb region is indeed the one predicted half a
century ago.

In this environment, network traffic includes long-lived (elephant) and

Although SDN-based approaches can efficiently allocate networking resources for
such flows, the overhead due to network reconfiguration can be significant.
With limited capacity of Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) deployed in

reinforcement learning based. Emulation results using the RL algorithm show
around 60% improvement in reducing the long-term control plane overhead, and

propagation of the waves across the potential wells of the substrate is
inhibited due to the confinement of the dust particles by the substrate minima.
If the substrate wells are narrow or deep, one-dimensional chains of particles
are formed in each minima, and the longitudinal motion of an individual chain
dominates the propagation of waves along the potential wells of the substrate.
Increasing the width or decreasing the depth of the substrate minima allows the
particles to buckle into a zig-zag structure, and the resulting spectra develop
two branches, one for sloshing motion and one for breathing motion. The
repulsion between neighboring dust particles produces backward propagation of
the sloshing wave for small wave numbers.

dose distributions in synchrotron micro- and mini-beam radiaton therapy and to
develop a model to help guide decisions and planning for future clinical
trials. Methods: The Monte Carlo code PENELOPE was used to simulate the
irradiation of a human head phantom with a variety of micro- and mini-beam
arrays, with beams narrower than 100mum and above 500mum, respectively, and
with radiation fields of 1cmx2cm and 2cmx2cm. The dose in the phantom due to
these beams was calculated by superposing the dose profiles obtained for a
single beam of 1mumx2cm. A parameter delta, accounting for the total
displacement of the brain during the irradiation and due to the
cardio-synchronous pulsation, was used to quantify the impact on peak-to-valley
dose ratios and the full-width at half-maximum. Results: The difference between
the maximum (at the phantom entrance) and the minimum (at the phantom exit)
values of the peak-to-valley dose ratio reduces when the parameter $\delta$
increases. The full-width at half-maximum remains almost constant with depth
for any $\delta$ value. Sudden changes in the two quantities are observed at
the interfaces between the various tissues (brain, skull and skin) present in
the head phantom. The peak-to-valley dose ratio at the center of the head
phantom reduces when delta increases, remaining above 70% of the static value
only for mini-beams and delta smaller than ~200mum. Conclusions: Optimal setups
for brain treatments with synchrotron radiation micro- and mini-beam combs
depend on the brain displacement due to cardio-synchronous pulsation.
Peak-to-valley dose ratios larger than 90% of the maximum values obtained in
the static case occur only for mini-beams and relatively large dose rates.

sequence of successful tests of the general theory of relativity (GR) since its
formulation in 1915. Yet these tests remain confined to the scale of stellar
systems or the strong gravity regime. A departure from GR on larger,
cosmological scales has been advocated by the proponents of modified gravity
theories as an alternative to the Cosmological Constant to account for the
observed cosmic expansion history. While indistinguishable in these terms by
construction, such models on the other hand yield distinct values for the
linear growth rate of density perturbations and, as a consequence, for the
associated galaxy peculiar velocity field. Measurements of the resulting
anisotropy of galaxy clustering, when spectroscopic redshifts are used to
derive distances, have thus been proposed as a powerful probe of the validity
of GR on cosmological scales. However, despite significant effort in modelling
such redshift space distortions, systematic errors remain comparable to current
statistical uncertainties. Here, we present the results of a different
forward-modelling approach, which fully exploits the sensitivity of the galaxy
velocity field to modifications of GR. We use state-of-the-art, high-resolution
N-body simulations of a standard GR and a compelling f(R) model, one of GR's
simplest variants, to build simulated catalogues of stellar-mass-selected
galaxies through a robust match to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations.
We find that, well within the uncertainty of this technique, f(R) fails to
reproduce the observed redshift-space clustering on scales 1-10 Mpc/h. Instead,
the standard LCDM GR model agrees impressively well with the data. This result
provides a strong confirmation, on cosmological scales, of the robustness of
Einstein's general theory of relativity.

very sensitive to small perturbations of $f$ and that its value depends heavily

computations, so we focus here on estimates of $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ that can be
expressed in terms of homotopy invariants of spaces $X$ and $Y$, or that are
valid if $f$ satisfy some additional assumptions like, for example, being a
fibration.
  Some of the main results are the derivation of a general upper bound for
$\mathrm{TC}(f)$, invariance of $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ with respect to deformations
of the domain and codomain, proof that $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ is a FHE-invariant, and
the description of a cohomological lower bound for $\mathrm{TC}(f)$.
Furthermore, if $f$ is a fibration we derive more precise estimates for
$\mathrm{TC}(f)$ in terms of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and the
topological complexity of $X$ and $Y$. We also obtain some results for the

Kolmogorov-type hypothesis for barotropic flows, in which the density and the
sonic speed normally vary significantly. We then observe that the compressible
Kolmogorov-type hypothesis implies the uniform boundedness of some fractional
derivatives of the weighted velocity and sonic speed in the space variables in
$L^2$, which is independent of the viscosity coefficient $\mu>0$. It is shown
that this key observation yields the equicontinuity in both space and time of

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1809.08721, arXiv:1705.07232",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-fidelity simulations of transcritical spray mixing and auto ignition in
a combustion chamber are performed at high pressure and temperature conditions
using a recently developed finite rate LES solver. The simulation framework is
based on a diffused-interface (DI) method that solves the compressible
multi-species conservation equations along with the Peng Robinson state
equation and real-fluid transport properties. A finite volume approach with
entropy stable scheme is employed to accurate simulate the non-linear real
fluid flow. LES analysis is performed for non-reacting and reacting spray
conditions targeting the ECN Spray A configuration at chamber conditions with a
pressure of 60 bar and temperatures between 800 K and 1200 K to investigate
effects of the real-fluid environment and low-temperature chemistry.
Comparisons with measurements in terms of global spray parameters and mixture
fraction distributions demonstrates the accuracy in modeling the turbulent
mixing behavior. Good overall agreement of the auto-ignition process is
obtained from simulation results at different ambient temperature conditions
and the formation of intermediate species is captured by the simulations,
indicating that the presented numerical framework adequately reproduces the
corresponding low-and-high-temperature ignition processes under high-pressure
conditions that are relevant to realistic diesel fuel injection systems.

name root-ratio methods), where $m$ is the multiplicity of the sought zero,
known in advance. Some of these methods were presented without any derivation

easy and entirely natural way for constructing root-ratio multipoint iterative
methods starting from multipoint methods for finding simple zeros. In this way,
a vast number of root-ratio multipoint methods for multiple zeros, existing as
well new ones, can be constructed. For demonstration, we derive four root-ratio

considered methods and give a comparative analysis that involves CPU time
needed for the extraction of the $m$-th root. This analysis shows that
root-ratio methods are pretty inefficient from the computational point of view

important factors affecting the performance of deep neural networks. Genetic
Algorithms (GA) have been used before to determine parameters of a network.
Yet, GAs perform a finite search over a discrete set of pre-defined candidates,
and cannot, in general, generate unseen configurations. In this paper, to move
from exploration to exploitation, we propose a novel and systematic method that
autonomously and simultaneously optimizes multiple parameters of any deep
neural network by using a GA aided by a bi-generative adversarial network
(Bi-GAN). The proposed Bi-GAN allows the autonomous exploitation and choice of
the number of neurons, for fully-connected layers, and number of filters, for
convolutional layers, from a large range of values. Our proposed Bi-GAN
involves two generators, and two different models compete and improve each
other progressively with a GAN-based strategy to optimize the networks during
GA evolution. Our proposed approach can be used to autonomously refine the
number of convolutional layers and dense layers, number and size of kernels,
and the number of neurons for the dense layers; choose the type of the
activation function; and decide whether to use dropout and batch normalization
or not, to improve the accuracy of different deep neural network architectures.
Without loss of generality, the proposed method has been tested with the
ModelNet database, and compared with the 3D Shapenets and two GA-only methods.
The results show that the presented approach can simultaneously and
successfully optimize multiple neural network parameters, and achieve higher

oscillations remain under-investigated. One reason is that the conventional
method used for generating bifurcation diagrams cannot reliably identify
features that are responsible for the identification of SuH and UH
oscillations. Additionally, the conventional method cannot distinguish between
the UHs and SHs. We introduce a simple procedure for the generation of
bifurcation diagrams to address this shortcoming. This method selects the
maxima of the bubble oscillatory response and plots them alongside the
traditional bifurcation points for the corresponding control parameter. Through
applying this method, the oscillatory behavior of the bubble oscillator is
analyzed, and stable SuH and UH bubble oscillations are investigated. Based on
this new analysis, the conditions for the generation and amplification of UH
and SuH regimes are discussed.

  Comparing Conjecture With Parallelised Computation",,,,,"math.NA math-ph math.MP math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel parallel numerical algorithm for calculating the smallest
eigenvalues of highly ill-conditioned matrices. It is based on the {\it LDLT}
decomposition and involves finding a $k \times k$ sub-matrix of the inverse of
the original $N \times N$ Hankel matrix $H_N^{-1}$ . The computation involves
extremely high precision arithmetic, message passing interface, and shared
memory parallelisation. We demonstrate that this approach achieves good
scalability on a high performance computing cluster (HPCC) which constitute a
major improvement of the earlier approaches. We use this method to study a
family of Hankel matrices generated by the weight $w(x)={\rm e}^{-x^{\beta}},$
supported on $[0,\infty)$ and $\beta>0.$ Such weight generates Hankel
determinant, a fundamental object in random matrix theory. In the situation
where $\beta>1/2,$ the smallest eigenvalue tend to 0, exponentially fast as $N$
gets large. If $\beta<1/2,$ the situation where the classical moment problem is
indeterminate, the smallest eigenvalue is bounded from below by a positive
number for all $N$, including infinity. If $\beta=1/2,$ it is conjectured that
the smallest eigenvalue tends to 0 algebraically, with a precise exponent. The
algorithm run on the HPCC producing fantastic match between the theoretical
value of $2/\pi$ and the numerical result.

the potential of Self-Organizing Maps to rapidly generate water depth and flood
extent results. To conduct the study, we developed a flood-simulation specific
SOM, using cellular automata flood model results and a synthetic DEM and inflow
hydrograph. The preliminary results showed that water depth and flood extent
results produced by the SOM are reasonably accurate and obtained in a very
short period of time. Based on this, it seems that SOMs have the potential to
provide critical flood information to support real-time flood mitigation
decisions. The findings presented would however require further investigations
to obtain general conclusions; these further investigations may include the
consideration of real terrain representations, real water supply networks and
realistic inflows from pipe bursts.

power harvesting from sea waves by consideration of JONSWAP wave theory is
investigated and the uncertainties of sea waves are studied for the first time.
For this purpose, a vertical beam fixed to the seabed which the piezoelectric
patches are attached to it, is considered as energy harvester and is modeled
and simulated by MATLAB software. The generated power is computed by
calculating the beam vibration response and the effect of piezoelectric patches
on the generated power is studied by statistical analysis. Furthermore,
reliability of the energy harvesting system is investigated as the possibility
of failure based on violation criteria. It is resulted that the probability of
failure increases by increasing the power.

because an improper or inaccurate measurement process can ruin the usefulness
of the metrics, no matter how well they are defined. This is a highly
challenging problem particularly when the ground truth is unknown or noisy. In
contrast to the well perceived importance of defining security metrics, the
measurement of security metrics has been little understood in the literature.
In this paper, we measure five malware detection metrics in the {\em absence}
of ground truth, which is a realistic setting that imposes many technical
challenges. The ultimate goal is to develop principled, automated methods for
measuring these metrics at the maximum accuracy possible. The problem naturally
calls for investigations into statistical estimators by casting the measurement
problem as a {\em statistical estimation} problem. We propose statistical
estimators for these five malware detection metrics. By investigating the
statistical properties of these estimators, we are able to characterize when
the estimators are accurate, and what adjustments can be made to improve them
under what circumstances. We use synthetic data with known ground truth to
validate these statistical estimators. Then, we employ these estimators to
measure five metrics with respect to a large dataset collected from VirusTotal.
We believe our study touches upon a vital problem that has not been paid due
attention and will inspire many future investigations.

ride-hailing services have enabled the collection of a tremendous amount of
probe vehicle trajectory data. Due to the large scale, the trajectory data have
become a potential substitute for the widely used fixed-location sensors in
terms of the performance measures of transportation networks. Specifically, for
traffic volume and queue length estimation, most of the trajectory data based
methods in the existing literature either require high market penetration of
the probe vehicles to identify the shockwave or require the prior information
about the queue length distribution and the penetration rate, which may not be
feasible in the real world. To overcome the limitations of the existing
methods, this paper proposes a series of novel methods based on probability
theory. By exploiting the stopping positions of the probe vehicles in the
queues, the proposed methods try to establish and solve a single-variable
equation for the penetration rate of the probe vehicles. Once the penetration
rate is obtained, it can be used to project the total queue length and the
total traffic volume. The validation results using both simulation data and
real-world data show that the methods would be accurate enough for assistance
in performance measures and traffic signal control at intersections, even when
the penetration rate of the probe vehicles is very low.

average peak width \sigma and luminescence life-times) and shifts due to ligand
