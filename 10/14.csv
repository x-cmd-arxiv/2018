dimensional charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole in de Rham, Gabadadze and
Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity is investigated via a modified Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. The results demonstrate that the modified thermodynamic quantities
not only are related to the properties of the higher dimensional charged AdS
black hole in dRGT massive gravity but also depend on the parameter $\beta$,
the coupling constant $\sigma$ and the mass of emitted particles $m$. In
addition, the modified Hawking temperature is higher than the original
temperature; hence, the effect of MDR can significantly enhance the evolution
of the black hole. Besides, our results can be verified using the modified
Stefan-Boltzmann law.

derive the Markovian quantum master equation in the subspace without ignoring

energy resources, among a massive number of users faces critical challenges. We
consider grouping wireless powered IoT users into available channels first and
then investigate power allocation for users grouped in the same channel to
improve the network throughput. Specifically, the user grouping problem is
formulated as a many to one matching game. It is achieved by considering IoT
users and channels as selfish players which belong to two disjoint sets. Both
selfish players focus on maximizing their own utilities. Then we propose an
efficient channel allocation algorithm (ECAA) with low complexity for user
grouping. Additionally, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to model
unpredictable energy arrival and channel conditions uncertainty at each user,
and a power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the accumulative
network throughput over a finite-horizon of time slots. By doing so, we can
distribute the channel access and dynamic power allocation local to IoT users.
Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed ECAA algorithm achieves
near-optimal performance and is superior to random channel assignment, but has
much lower computational complexity. Moreover, simulations show that the
distributed power allocation policy for each user is obtained with better
performance than a centralized offline scheme.

contribution of the vacuum energy of Minkowski space is usually subtracted from
that of the original system. In large mass limit for surface $S^2$; however,
some divergences would eventually remain in the obtained result. To remove
these remaining divergences, a secondary renormalization program was manually
performed. In the present work, a direct approach for calculation of the
Casimir energy has been introduced. In this approach, two similar
configurations were considered and then the vacuum energies of these
configurations were subtracted from each other. This method provides more
physical meaning respect to the other common methods. Additionally, in large
mass limit for surface $S^2$, it provides a situation in which the second
renormalization program is automatically conducted in the calculation
procedure, and there was no need to do that anymore manually. Finally, by
plotting the obtained values for the Casimir energy of the topologies and
investigating their appropriate limits, the logic agreement between the results

So information can be encoded in it in at least 29 different ways. A 3-point

be the most promising probe of the cosmic dark ages. The signal carries
information about the thermal state along with density distribution of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR),
through its interaction with charged particles, plays a major role in
determining the kinetic and spin temperature of HI gas in the IGM during dark
ages. A Spatially fluctuating ionization fraction, which is caused by
inhomogeneous recombinations, causes heat transfer from the CMBR to the IGM gas
inhomogeneous. We revisit the impact of this inhomogeneous heat transfer on
spatial fluctuations in the observed HI 21-cm signal over a large redshift
range during dark ages. Our study shows that the effect negatively impacts
fluctuations in the HI spin temperature and results in an enhanced HI 21-cm
power spectrum. We find that the effect is particularly important during the
transition of the gas kinetic temperature being coupled to the CMBR to fully
decoupled from it, i.e., in the redshift range $30 \lesssim z \lesssim 300$. It
is found that, on the average the HI power spectrum, $P_{T_b}(k, z)$ is

integrate all evidence. Here we derive network models of rational (Bayes
optimal) agents who accumulate private measurements and observe decisions of
their neighbors to make an irreversible choice between two options. The
resulting information exchange dynamics has interesting properties: When one
option is preferred, the absence of a decision can be increasingly informative
over time. In recurrent networks an absence of a decision can lead to a
sequence of belief updates akin to those in the literature on common knowledge.
Information obtained from observing repeated non-decisions is independent of
realization, unless the private information of agents is redundant. On the
other hand, in larger networks a single decision can trigger a cascade of
agreements and disagreements that depend on the private information agents have

in the economics literature, which largely ignore the temporal dynamics of
decisions, and the single-observer evidence accumulator models used widely in

expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and
altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This
alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave
background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at
radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a
flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is
centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at
half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is
largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by
early stars, however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a
factor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests
that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background
radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such
as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this
discrepancy, of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and
particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between
dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The
low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had
produced a background of Lyman-alpha photons by 180 million years after the Big
Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the
radiation temperature less than 100 million years later.

the guard and develop an effective evacuation strategy in the artificial
attack, an extended floor field model was proposed. In this model, the assault
on pedestrians, the death of pedestrians and the capture of the guard were
involved simultaneously. An alternative evacuation strategy which can largely
reduce the number of death was developed and effects of several key parameters
such as the deterrence radius and capture distance on evacuation dynamics were
studied. Results show that congestion near the exit has dual effects. More
specially, the guard could catch all attackers in a short time because the
attackers would have more concentrated distribution, but more casualties would
happen because pedestrians are hard to escape the attack due to congestion. In
contrast, when pedestrians have more preference of approaching the guard,
although the guard would take more time to capture the attackers result from
the dispersion of attackers, the death toll would decrease. One of the reason
is the dispersal of the crowd and the decrease in congestion would be
beneficial for escape. Another is the attackers would be killed before
launching the attack to the people those are around the guard, in other words,
the guard would protect a large number of pedestrians from being killed.
Moreover, increasing capture distance of the guard can effectively reduce the
casualties and the catch time. As the deterrence radius reflecting the tendency
of escaping from the guard for attackers rises, it would become more difficult
for the guard to catch the attackers and more casualties are caused. However,
when the deterrence radius reaches a certain level, the number of deaths would
be reduced because the attackers would prefer to stay as far away as possible
from instead of the position where they could attack more people.

actuators in the emerging field of soft robotics. Intrinsically compliant, with
continuum of motion, large strokes, little friction, and high power-to-weight
ratio, they are very similar to biological muscles, and have enabled new
applications in automation, architecture, medicine, and human-robot
interaction. To foster future applications of FEAs, in this paper we present a
new manufacturing method for fast and precise scalable production of complex
FEAs of high quality (leak-free, single-body form, with <0.2 mm precision). The
method is based on 3d moulding and supports elastomers with a wide range of
viscosity, pot life, and Young's modulus. We developed this process for two
different settings: one in laboratory conditions for fast prototyping with 3d
printed moulds and using multi-component liquid elastomers, and the other
process in an industrial setting with 3d moulds micromachined in metal and
applying compression moulding. We demonstrate these methods in fabrication of
up to several tens of two-axis, three-chambered soft actuators, with two types
of chamber walls: cylindrical and corrugated. The actuators are then applied as
motion drivers in kinetic photovoltaic building envelopes.

  Inspection System",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyber-security is an important societal concern. Cyber-attacks have increased
in numbers as well as in the extent of damage caused in every attack. Large
organizations operate a Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC), which form the
first line of cyber-defense. The inspection of cyber-alerts is a critical part
of CSOC operations. A recent work, in collaboration with Army Research Lab, USA
proposed a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to prevent the
cyber-alert queue length from growing large and overwhelming the defender.
Given the potential deployment of this approach to CSOCs run by US defense
agencies, we perform a red team (adversarial) evaluation of this approach.
Further, with the recent attacks on learning systems, it is even more important
to test the limits of this RL approach. Towards that end, we learn an
adversarial alert generation policy that is a best response to the defender
inspection policy. Surprisingly, we find the defender policy to be quite robust
to the best response of the attacker. In order to explain this observation, we
extend the earlier RL model to a game model and show that there exists defender
policies that can be robust against any adversarial policy. We also derive a
competitive baseline from the game theory model and compare it to the RL
approach. However, we go further to exploit assumptions made in the MDP in the
RL model and discover an attacker policy that overwhelms the defender. We use a
double oracle approach to retrain the defender with episodes from this
discovered attacker policy. This made the defender robust to the discovered
attacker policy and no further harmful attacker policies were discovered.
Overall, the adversarial RL and double oracle approach in RL are general
techniques that are applicable to other RL usage in adversarial environments.

lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) have been complemented in recent years
with the inclusion of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The aim is to confront
experimental results with more precise theoretical determinations, e.g. for the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the CP-violating parameters in the
decay of mesons. Quantifying the effects arising from enclosing QED in a finite
volume remains a primary target of investigations. To this end, finite-volume
corrections to hadron masses in the presence of QED have been carefully studied
in recent years. This paper extends such studies to the self-energy of moving
charged hadrons, both on and away from their mass shell. In particular, we
present analytical results for leading finite-volume corrections to the
self-energy of spin-0 and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the presence of QED
on a periodic hypercubic lattice, once the spatial zero mode of the photon is
removed, a framework that is called $\mathrm{QED}_{\mathrm{L}}$. By altering
modes beyond the zero mode, an improvement scheme is introduced to eliminate
the leading finite-volume corrections to masses, with potential applications to
other hadronic quantities. Our analytical results are verified by a dedicated
numerical study of a lattice scalar field theory coupled to
$\mathrm{QED}_{\mathrm{L}}$. Further, this paper offers new perspectives on the
subtleties involved in applying low-energy effective field theories in the
presence of $\mathrm{QED}_{\mathrm{L}}$, a theory that is rendered non-local
with the exclusion of the spatial zero mode of the photon, clarifying recent
discussions on this matter.

is needed to detect and respond to CO2 leakage. CO2 leakage detection methods
rely on geophysical observations and monitoring sensor network. However,
traditional methods usually require the development of site-specific physical
models and expert interpretation, and the effectiveness of these methods can be
limited to different application locations, operational scenarios, and
conditions. In this paper, we developed a novel data-driven leakage detection
method based on densely connected convolutional neural networks. Our method
differs from conventional leakage monitoring methods by directly learning a
mapping relationship between seismic data and the CO2 leakage mass. To account
for the spatial and temporal characteristics of seismic data, our novel
networks architecture combines 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks. To
overcome the computational expense of solving optimization problems, we apply a
densely-connecting strategy in our network architecture that reduces the number
of network parameters. Based on the features generated by our convolutional
neural networks, we further incorporate a long short-term memory network to
utilize time-sequential information, which further improves the detection
accuracy. Finally, we employ our detection method to synthetic seismic datasets
generated based on flow simulations of a hypothetical CO2 storage scenario with
injection into a partially compartmentalized sandstone storage reservoir. To
evaluate method performance, we conducted multiple experiments including a
random leakage test, a sequential test, and a robustness test. Numerical
results show that our CO2 leakage detection method successfully detects the
leakage and accurately predicts the leakage mass, suggesting that it has the
potential for application in monitoring of real CO2 storage sites.

the ones of distribution with unbounded densities or supported on a mixture of
manifolds with different dimensions. Analogous bounds are derived for the

base case for other energy management system (EMS) applications including
real-time contingency analysis and security-constrained economic dispatch.
Recent work in the literature shows malicious cyber-attack can inject false
measurements that bypass traditional bad data detection in state estimation and
cause actual overloads. Thus, it is very important to detect such cyber-attack.
In this paper, multiple metrics are proposed to monitor abnormal load
deviations and suspicious branch flow changes. A systematic two-stage approach
is proposed to detect false data injection (FDI) cyber-attack. The first stage
determines whether the system is under attack while the second stage identifies
the target branch. Numerical simulations verify that FDI can cause severe
system violations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage
FDI detection (FDID) method. It is concluded that the proposed FDID approach
can efficiently detect FDI cyber-attack and identify the target branch, which
will substantially improve operators situation awareness in real-time.

Varifocal-Net for simultaneous classification of chromosome's type and polarity

network (G-Net) and one local-scale network (L-Net). It follows three stages.
The first stage is to learn both global and local features. We extract global
features and detect finer local regions via the G-Net. By proposing a varifocal
mechanism, we zoom into local parts and extract local features via the L-Net.
Residual learning and multi-task learning strategies are utilized to promote
high-level feature extraction. The detection of discriminative local parts is
fulfilled by a localization subnet of the G-Net, whose training process
involves both supervised and weakly-supervised learning. The second stage is to
build two multi-layer perceptron classifiers that exploit features of both two
scales to boost classification performance. The third stage is to introduce a
dispatch strategy of assigning each chromosome to a type within each patient
case, by utilizing the domain knowledge of karyotyping. Evaluation results from
1909 karyotyping cases showed that the proposed Varifocal-Net achieved the
highest accuracy per patient case (%) 99.2 for both type and polarity tasks. It
outperformed state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our

frequency and timing of SMA are expected to affect levels of EPA, increasing
the number of brand related queries, clickthrough, and purchase orders. This
paper applies cross-sectional data analysis to explore such beliefs and
demonstrates weak-to-moderate correlations between daily SMA and EPA volumes.
Further correlation analysis, using 30-day rolling windows, shows a high
variability in correlation of SMA-EPA pairs and calls into question the
predictive potential of SMA in relation to EPA. Considering the moderate
correlation of selected SMA and EPA pairs (e.g., Post-Orders), we investigate
whether SMA features can predict changes in the EPA levels, instead of precise
EPA daily volumes. We define such levels in terms of EPA distribution quantiles
(2, 3, and 5 levels) over training data. We formulate the EPA quantile
predictions as a multi-class categorization problem. The experiments with
Random Forest and Logistic Regression show a varied success, performing better
than random for the top quantiles of purchase orders and for the lowest
quantile of search and clickthrough activities. Similar results are obtained
when predicting multi-day cumulative EPA levels (1, 3, and 7 days). Our results
have considerable practical implications but, most importantly, urge the common
beliefs to be re-examined, seeking a stronger evidence of SMA effects on EPA.

previous laser pulses has been heating up the qubit's environment. This paper
analyzes several tests to detect such context-dependent errors (which include
various types of non-Markovian errors). A key feature of these tests is that
they are robust against both state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors

small in practice, it becomes important to carefully analyze the effects of
statistical fluctuations and so we investigate the power and precision of our
tests as functions of the number of repetitions and the length of the sequences
of gates. From our tests an important quantity emerges: the logarithm of the

$\mathcal{P}.$ For this reason, we derive the probability distribution of the
log-det estimates which we then use to examine the performance of our tests for
various single- and two-qubit sets of measurements and initial states. Finally,

to integrate both mechanistic models, which describe dynamics in soil moisture
variations, and data-driven models, which characterize uncertainty in forecast
errors of evapotranspiration and precipitation, into a holistic systems control
framework. To better capture the support of uncertainty distribution, we take a
new learning-based approach by constructing uncertainty sets from historical
data. For evapotranspiration forecast error, the support vector
clustering-based uncertainty set is adopted, which can be conveniently built
from historical data. As for precipitation forecast errors, we analyze the
dependence of their distribution on forecast values, and further design a
tailored uncertainty set based on the properties of this type of uncertainty.
In this way, the overall uncertainty distribution can be elaborately described,
which finally contributes to rational and efficient control decisions. To
assure the quality of data-driven uncertainty sets, a training-calibration
scheme is used to provide theoretical performance guarantees. A generalized
affine decision rule is adopted to obtain tractable approximations of optimal
control problems, thereby ensuring the practicability of DDRMPC. Case studies
using real data show that, DDRMPC can reliably maintain soil moisture above the
safety level and avoid crop devastation. The proposed DDRMPC approach leads to
a 40% reduction of total water consumption compared to the fine-tuned open-loop
control strategy. In comparison with the carefully tuned rule-based control and
certainty equivalent model predictive control, the proposed DDRMPC approach can
significantly reduce the total water consumption and improve the control
performance.

Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as the baseline and propose a novel comparison
detector to deal with the limited data problem. The key idea is that classify
the proposals by comparing with the reference samples of each category in

background from data instead of manually choosing them by some heuristic rules.
Experimental results show that the proposed Comparison Detector yields
significant improvement on the small dataset, achieving a mean Average

vertical [Fe/H] gradients flatten with $R$. Stars of 4--6\,Gyr exhibit steeper
negative radial [Fe/H] gradients than those of either younger or older ages.
Values of [$\alpha$/Fe] of mono-age stellar populations also show significant
radial and vertical gradients, with patterns varying with age. The [Fe/H]
distribution profiles of old ($>8$\,Gyr) stars vary little with $R$, while
those of younger stars exhibit strong radial variations, probably a consequence
of significant radial migration. The [$\alpha$/Fe] radial distribution profiles
show opposite patterns of variations with age compared to those of [Fe/H]. We

percolation theory (PT) and the effective-medium approximation (EMA) to better
understand diffusion and permeability of gas in packings of angular and rounded
sand grains as well as glass beads. Two average sizes of grain i.e., 0.3 and

so that the total porosity of all packs was near 0.4. Water content, gas-filled
porosity (also known as gas content), gas diffusion, and gas permeability were
measured at different capillary pressures. The X-ray computed tomography method
and the 3DMA-Rock software package were applied to determine the average pore
coordination number z. Results showed that both saturation-dependent diffusion
and permeability of gas showed almost linear behavior at higher gas-filled
porosities, while deviated substantially from linear scaling at lower gas
saturations. Comparing the theory with the diffusion and permeability
experiments showed that the determined value of z ranged between 2.8 and 5.3,
not greatly different from X-ray computed tomography results. The obtained

that the nuclear velocity distributions obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics as

Specifically, the BBN epoch is characterized by a dilute baryon plasma for
which the velocity distribution of nuclei is mainly determined by the dominant
Coulomb scattering with mildly relativistic electrons. This modifies the
nuclear velocity distributions and significantly alters the thermonuclear

signal is created to parametrically excite (pump) the system and produce the
desired energy shift. The pump signal is applied by a controlled
electromechanical actuator, and is modified in-situ according to the slow
frequency signal and the desired response. A three DOF model is introduced, and
the governing nonlinear EOM are derived and solved analytically via asymptotic
methods and verified with numerical simulations. A parametric design of an
experimental rig was carried out, and the importance of experimental
calibration and system identification is emphasized. Some preliminary
experimental results are provided with favorable agreement with the theory.

machinery, while it is being rotated at speeds considerably slower than the
""critical speeds"", where dangerously high vibration amplitudes may arise. By
utilizing tuned dual frequency parametric excitation along with optimized
nonlinear feedback terms, the slow imbalance forces are projected onto a chosen
mode of vibration. This allows to identify the imbalance projection on that
specific mode, and to cancel these forces by adding or reducing mass. The
scheme benefits from two kinds of parametric excitation yielding combination
and principal parametric resonances. The former is used to project the
imbalance forces onto a selected vibration mode, and the latter significantly
amplifies the response. By tuning the parametric excitation and the nonlinear
terms in an optimal manner, a pseudo-linear behavior is formed. This behavior
enables to increase both amplification and sensitivity to the imbalance forces
without having to compromise between the two.

particle method mainly comes from the recovery of the time evolution flux
function in the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) through a coupled dynamic
process of particle transport and collision. This practice improves the
original operator splitting approach in the Monte Carlo method, such as the
separated treatment of particle transport and collision. As a result, with the
variation of the ratio between numerical time step and local photon's collision
time, different transport physics can be fully captured in a single
computation. In the diffusive limit, the UGKP method could recover the solution
of the diffusion equation with the cell size and time step being much larger
than the photon's mean free path and the mean collision time. In the free
transport limit, it presents an exact particle tracking process as the original
Monte Carlo method. In the transition regime, the weights of particle free
transport and collision are determined by the ratio of local numerical time
step to the photon's collision time. Several one-dimensional numerical examples
covering all transport regimes from the optically thin to optically thick are
computed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the current scheme. In
comparison with the $S_N$ discrete ordinate method, the UGKP method is based on
particles and avoids the discretization of particle velocity space, which does
not suffer from the ray effect.

reinterpret the contradictory lattice results based on this method,

subwavelength superoscillation focal spot formed without involving evanescent
EM waves, and without an accompanying region of exorbitantly high waveform

proton attack. In a protoplanetary disk around a young star, molecules would be
illuminated by high energy photon and ionized to be cationic-(C5H5).
Calculation shows that from neutral to tri-cation, molecule keeps original
configuration. At a step of sixth cation, there occurs surprising creation of
cyclic-C3H2, which is the smallest PAH. Astronomical cyclic-C3H2 had been
identified by radio astronomy. Deep photoionization of cyclic-C3H2 brings
successive molecular change. Neutral and mono-cation keep cyclic configuration.
At a step of di-cation, molecule was transformed to aliphatic chain-C3H2.
Finally, chain-C3H2 was decomposed to pure carbon chain-C3 and two hydrogen
atoms. Calculated infrared spectrum of those molecules was applied to observed
spectrum of Herbig Ae young stars. Observed infrared spectrum could be
partially explained by small molecules. Meanwhile, excellent coincidence was
obtained by applying a larger molecules as like (C23H12)2+ or (C12H8)2+.
Infrared observation is suitable for larger molecules and radio astronomy for
smaller asymmetric molecules. It should be noted that these molecules could be
identified in a natural way introducing two astronomical phenomena, that is,
void-induced molecular deformation and deep photoionization.

and the subpacketization level, the number of divided packets of each file when
we implement a coded caching scheme. We prefer to design a scheme with rate and
packet number as small as possible since they reflect the transmission
efficiency and complexity of the caching scheme, respectively.
  In this paper, we first characterize a coded caching scheme from the
viewpoint of linear algebra and show that designing a linear coded caching
scheme is equivalent to constructing three classes of matrices satisfying some
rank conditions. Then based on the invariant linear subspaces and combinatorial
design theory, several classes of new coded caching schemes over $\mathbb{F}_2$

the rate of our new rate is the same as the scheme construct by Yan et al.

significantly reduced. A concatenating construction then is used for flexible

Lubin-Tate spaces. As an global application, we give a new construction of
automorphic congruences in the Ribet spirit.

this paper we propose a data stream library for Big Data preprocessing, named
DPASF, under Apache Flink. We have implemented six of the most popular data
preprocessing algorithms, three for discretization and the rest for feature
selection. The algorithms have been tested using two Big Data datasets.
Experimental results show that preprocessing can not only reduce the size of
the data, but to maintain or even improve the original accuracy in a short

The preprocessing algorithms included in the library are able to tackle Big

of multivariate continuous (Lie) symmetries induced by a vector or tensor field

of fractionation, where mixture components are distributed unevenly across

information processing, because during a Rabi cycle a pair of entangled photons
may be created. We theoretically investigate the onset of this phenomenon in a
heterodimer comprising a semiconductor quantum dot strongly coupled to a metal
nanoparticle. Two-photon Rabi oscillations in this system occur due to a
coherent two-photon process involving the ground-to-biexciton transition in the
quantum dot. The presence of a metal nanoparticle nearby the quantum dot
results in a self-action of the quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle, because
the polatization state of the latter depends on the quantum state of the
former. The interparticle interaction gives rise to two principal effects: (i)
- enhancement of the external field amplitude and (ii) - renormalization of the
quantum dot's resonance frequencies and relaxation rates of the off-diagonal
density matrix elements, both depending on the populations of the quantum dot's
levels. Here, we focus on the first effect, which results in interesting new
features, in particular, in an increased number of Rabi cycles per pulse as
compared to an isolated quantum dot and subsequent growth of the number of
entangled photon pairs per pulse. We also discuss the destructive role of
radiative decay of the excitonic states on two-photon Rabi oscillations for
both an isolated quantum dot and a heterodimer.

non-Noetherian. We first define the generalized notions of associated primes of
a module over a non-Noetherian ring. Then for any $R$-module $M$, we state a
correspondence between certain generalized prime ideals of $(R^\infty \otimes_R
M)/N$ over $R^\infty$, and the union of associated prime ideals of $F^e(M)/N_e$
as $e \in \mathbb{N}$ varies. Here $F$ refers to the Frobenius functor, and in

$(R,\mathfrak{m})$ is an $F$-pure local ring, we then show that
depth$_R(F^e(M))$ is constant for $e \gg 0$, and we call this value the
stabilizing depth, or s depth$_R(M)$. Lastly, we turn to non-Noetherian
measures of the depth of $R^\infty \otimes_R M$ over $R^\infty$, which
generalize as well. Two of these values are the k depth and the c depth, and we
show k depth$_{R^\infty} (R^\infty \otimes_R M) =$ s depth$_R (M) \geq$ c
depth$_{R^\infty} (R^\infty \otimes_R M)$, while all three values are equal

the state aggregation structure of a finite-state Markov chain under an
assumption that the state space can be mapped into a handful of meta-states.
The number of meta-states is characterized by the nonnegative rank of the
Markov transition matrix. Motivated by the success of the nuclear norm
relaxation in low rank minimization problems, we propose an atomic regularizer
as a convex surrogate for the nonnegative rank and formulate a convex
optimization problem. Because the atomic regularizer itself is not
computationally tractable, we instead solve a sequence of problems involving a
nonnegative factorization of the Markov transition matrices by using the
proximal alternating linearized minimization method. Two methods for adjusting
the rank of factorization are developed so that local minima are escaped. One
is to append an additional column to the factorized matrices, which can be
interpreted as an approximation of a negative subgradient step. The other is to
reduce redundant dimensions by means of linear combinations. Overall, the
proposed algorithm very likely converges to the global solution. The efficiency
and statistical properties of our approach are illustrated on synthetic data.
We also apply our state aggregation algorithm on a Manhattan transportation
data set and make extensive comparisons with an existing method.

Random Walks (RWs) on multi-hop paths. Only a few unified models take both
semantic and path-related features into consideration with adequacy. In this
paper, we propose a novel method to explore the intrinsic relationship between
the single relation (i.e. 1-hop path) and multi-hop paths between paired
entities. We use Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to select important
relations in multi-hop paths and encode them into low-dimensional vectors. By
treating relations and multi-hop paths as two different input sources, we use a
feature extractor, which is shared by two downstream components (i.e. relation
classifier and source discriminator), to capture shared/similar information
between them. By joint adversarial training, we encourage our model to extract
features from the multi-hop paths which are representative for relation
completion. We apply the trained model (except for the source discriminator) to
several large-scale KBs for relation completion. Experimental results show that
our method outperforms existing path information-based approaches. Since each
sub-module of our model can be well interpreted, our model can be applied to a
large number of relation learning tasks.

equilibration between these two modes always led to an observed downstream
v=2/3 charge mode accompanied by an upstream neutral mode (preventing an

synthetize the v=2/3 edge mode from its basic counter-propagating charged

the 2D plane to two gated intersecting halves, each with different fillings,
counter-propagating chiral modes can be formed along the intersection line.

essentially equivalent to the global Kato type smoothing estimates for some

we immediately have two results as follows. One is that the known local Kato
smoothing estimates are sharp. The sharp regularity ranges of the global Kato
smoothing estimates are already known, but those of the local Kato smoothing
estimates are not. Recently, Sun, Tr\'elat, Zhang and Zhong have shown it only
in spacetime $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R$. Our result resolves this issue in
higher dimensions. The other one is the sharp global-in-time maximal

high-resolution ($\sim0.12''$) ALMA 1.33 mm survey of 32 disks in the Taurus
star-forming region, which was designed to cover a wide range of sub-mm
brightness and to be unbiased to previously known substructures. While
axisymmetric rings and gaps are common within our sample, spiral patterns and
high contrast azimuthal asymmetries are not detected. Fits of disk models to
the visibilities lead to estimates of the location and shape of gaps and rings,
the flux in each disk component, and the size of the disk. The dust
substructures occur across a wide range of stellar mass and disk brightness.
Disks with multiple rings tend to be more massive and more extended. The
correlation between gap locations and widths, the intensity contrast between
rings and gaps, and the separations of rings and gaps could all be explained if
most gaps are opened by low-mass planets (super-Earths and Neptunes) in the
condition of low disk turbulence ($\alpha=10^{-4}$). The gap locations are not
well correlated with the expected locations of CO and N$_2$ ice lines, so
condensation fronts are unlikely to be a universal mechanism to create gaps and

contact rich behaviors with multi-fingered hands. Deep RL provides an
end-to-end approach to directly map sensor readings to actions, without the
need for task specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich
manipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by directly
training with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world, with minimal
additional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We learn a variety of
complex behaviors on two different low-cost hardware platforms. We show that
each task can be learned entirely from scratch, and further study how the
learning process can be further accelerated by using a small number of human
demonstrations to bootstrap learning. Our experiments demonstrate that complex
multi-fingered manipulation skills can be learned in the real world in about
4-7 hours for most tasks, and that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3
hours, indicating that direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable
and practical alternative to simulation and model-based control.

for the elastic properties of interest (such as density, P-wave and S-wave

subsurface petrophysical variables. The sequential approach does not ensure a
proper propagation of uncertainty throughout the entire geo-modelling workflow

propose to integrate seismic and rock physics modelling into an iterative
geostatistical seismic inversion methodology. The proposed method allows the
direct inference of the porosity, volume of shale and fluid saturations by
simultaneously integrating well-logs, seismic reflection data and rock physics
model predictions. Stochastic sequential simulation is used as the perturbation
technique of the model parameter space, a calibrated facies-dependent rock
physics model links the elastic and the petrophysical domains and a global

divergence associated with smooth, proper, and convex loss functions is upper
bounded by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to within a normalization

performance guarantees with respect to a broad class of accuracy measures.

variety of object transparencies. The demonstration experiments help to clearly
explain the similarity and the difference between convolution and correlation
operations. This method of teaching using simulation and hands-on experiments
can stimulate the curiosity of the students. The feedback of the students, in
my class teaching, has been quite encouraging.

detection-based applications, such as object tracking, action recognition,
robot navigation, and visual surveillance applications. In mostcases, image
quality is noisy and biased, and as a result, the data distributions are
disturbed and imbalanced. Most object detection approaches, such as the faster
region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN), Single Shot Multibox
Detector with 300x300 inputs (SSD300), and You Only Look Once version 2
(YOLOv2), rely on simple sampling without considering distortions and noise
under real-world changing environments, despite poor object labeling. In this
paper, we propose an Incremental active semi-supervised learning (IASSL)
technology for unseen object detection. It combines batch-based active learning
(AL) and bin-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage the strong points
of AL's exploration and SSL's exploitation capabilities. A collaborative
sampling method is also adopted to measure the uncertainty and diversity of AL
and the confidence in SSL. Batch-based AL allows us to select more informative,
confident, and representative samples with low cost. Bin-based SSL divides
streaming image samples into several bins, and each bin repeatedly transfers
the discriminative knowledge of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep
learning to the next bin until the performance criterion is reached. IASSL can
overcome noisy and biased labels in unknown, cluttered data distributions. We
obtain superior performance, compared to state-of-the-art technologies such as
Faster RCNN, SSD300, and YOLOv2.

Tralie, Paul Bendich, John Harer","Multi-scale Geometric Summaries for Similarity-based Sensor Fusion","9 pages, 13 Figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we address fusion of heterogeneous sensor data using
wavelet-based summaries of fused self-similarity information from each sensor.
The technique we develop is quite general, does not require domain specific
knowledge or physical models, and requires no training. Nonetheless, it can
perform surprisingly well at the general task of differentiating classes of
time-ordered behavior sequences which are sensed by more than one modality. As
a demonstration of our capabilities in the audio to video context, we focus on
the differentiation of speech sequences.
  Data from two or more modalities first are represented using self-similarity
matrices(SSMs) corresponding to time-ordered point clouds in feature spaces of
each of these data sources; we note that these feature spaces can be of
entirely different scale and dimensionality.
  A fused similarity template is then derived from the modality-specific SSMs
using a technique called similarity network fusion (SNF). We investigate
pipelines using SNF as both an upstream (feature-level) and a downstream
(ranking-level) fusion technique. Multiscale geometric features of this
template are then extracted using a recently-developed technique called the
scattering transform, and these features are then used to differentiate speech
sequences. This method outperforms unsupervised techniques which operate
directly on the raw data, and it also outperforms stovepiped methods which
operate on SSMs separately derived from the distinct modalities. The benefits
of this method become even more apparent as the simulated peak signal to noise
ratio decreases.

link capacity of a single wavelength for optical interconnects via the use of
multiple mode-channels in multimode bus waveguide.In order to route the data in
MDM systems, waveguide bends are typically needed.In particular, ultra-sharp
bends are desirable for reducing the chip area occupied by high-density
photonic intergrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we propose and demonstrate
a novel meta-surfaced waveguide structure on silicon, which enables
ultral-sharp multimode waveguide bends to have low loss and low crosstalk among
different mode-channels.An ultra-sharp S-bend with a bending radius of
R=10{\mu}m is realized for an MDM optical interconnect with three
mode-channels. The numerical simulation shows that the proposed ultal-sharp
meta-surfaced multimode waveguide bend (MMWB) has low excess losses (0.2~0.5dB)
and low inter-mode crosstalk (<-30dB) over a broad wavelength-band(>100nm) for
all the three mode-channels. This is verified by experimental results, which
show that the fabricated S-bends have excess losses of 0.5~0.8dB and inter-mode
crosstalk of <-20 dB over a wavelength of >60 nm. The experimental results were
partially limited by the measurement setup, particularly the on-chip mode
(de)multiplexers which had inter-mode crosstalk of about -20dB. The proposed
MMWB can be extended for the transmission of more than three mode-channels.Our
work paves the way to use meta-surfaced silicon photonic waveguide structures
for on-chip multimode optical interconnect.
