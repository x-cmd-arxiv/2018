considering the polynomial part of them expressed in a basis that satisfies a
three term recurrence relation. For this purpose, we combine the theory
developed by Amparan et al., MIMS EPrint 2016.51, and the new linearizations of
polynomial matrices introduced by Fa{\ss}bender and Saltenberger, Linear
Algebra Appl., 525 (2017). In addition, we present a detailed study of how to
recover eigenvectors of a rational matrix from those of its linearizations in
this family. We complete the paper by discussing how to extend the results when
the polynomial part is expressed in other bases, and by presenting strong
linearizations that preserve the structure of symmetric or Hermitian rational
matrices. A conclusion of this work is that the combination of the results in
this paper with those in Amparan et al., MIMS EPrint 2016.51, allows us to use
essentially all the strong linearizations of polynomial matrices developed in
the last fifteen years to construct strong linearizations of any rational
matrix by expressing such matrix in terms of its polynomial and strictly proper
parts.

higher in chaotic regions where the quantum states diverge from the

computational domains in three spatial dimensions (3D) and for long
computational times. We apply the methods developed to the particular problem
of instabilities of thin fluid films of nanoscale thickness. The large scale of
the simulations minimizes the effects of boundaries, and also allows for
simulating domains of the size encountered in published experiments. As an
outcome, we can analyze the development of instabilities with an unprecedented
level of detail. A particular focus is on analyzing the manner in which
instability develops, in particular regarding differences between spinodal and
nucleation types of dewetting for linearly unstable films, as well as
instabilities of metastable films. Simulations in 3D allow for consideration of
some recent results that were previously obtained in the 2D geometry (J. Fluid

transforms as well as topological invariants (Betti numbers) to distinguish the
outcomes of spinodal and nucleation types of instabilities, describing in
precise terms the complex processes that lead to the formation of satellite
drops, as well as distinguishing the shape of the evolving film front in

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, are based on the learning framework of
rigid structure-from-motion, where only 3D camera ego motion is modeled for
geometry estimation.However, moving objects also exist in many videos, e.g.
moving cars in a street scene. In this paper, we tackle such motion by
additionally incorporating per-pixel 3D object motion into the learning
framework, which provides holistic 3D scene flow understanding and helps single
image geometry estimation. Specifically, given two consecutive frames from a
video, we adopt a motion network to predict their relative 3D camera pose and a
segmentation mask distinguishing moving objects and rigid background. An
optical flow network is used to estimate dense 2D per-pixel correspondence. A
single image depth network predicts depth maps for both images. The four types
of information, i.e. 2D flow, camera pose, segment mask and depth maps, are
integrated into a differentiable holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), where
per-pixel 3D motion for rigid background and moving objects are recovered. We
design various losses w.r.t. the two types of 3D motions for training the depth
and motion networks, yielding further error reduction for estimated geometry.
Finally, in order to solve the 3D motion confusion from monocular videos, we
combine stereo images into joint training. Experiments on KITTI 2015 dataset
show that our estimated geometry, 3D motion and moving object masks, not only
are constrained to be consistent, but also significantly outperforms other SOTA
algorithms, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.

exploring potential risks to the human brain from augmented reality. Our
initial focus is on sensory and perceptual risks (e.g., accidentally or

photosensitive epilepsy), but similar risks may span both lower- and
higher-level human brain functions, including cognition, memory, and

dangerous in AR due to the richness and depth with which it interacts with a

computer security threat modeling, to conceptually and experimentally evaluate
such risks. The ultimate goal of our work is to aid AR technology developers,
researchers, and neuroscientists to consider these issues before AR
technologies are widely deployed and become targets for real adversaries. By
considering and addressing these issues now, we can help ensure that future AR

the occupied states flow along this axis giving rise to the creation of

type II Weyl points while the holes belong to the vicinity of the other. This
process may be considered as the manifestation of the chiral anomaly that
exists without any external magnetic field. It may be observed experimentally
through the measurement of conductivity. Next, we consider the modification of
the theory in the presence of elastic deformations. In the domain of the
considered model, where it describes the type I Weyl semimetals the elastic
deformations lead to the appearance of emergent gravity. In the domain of the
type II Weyl semimetals the form of the Fermi surface is changed due to the
elastic deformations, and its fluctuations represent the special modes of the
zero sound. We find that there is one - to one correspondence between them and
the sound waves of the elasticity theory. Next, we discuss the influence of the
elastic deformations on the conductivity. The particularly interesting case is
when our model describes the intermediate state between the type I and the type

lines instead of the Fermi points/Fermi surface, while the DC conductivity

identifying expressive fragments of epistemic logics that are tractable for

developed. In this paper, by employing logical separability, we propose an

multidimensional surveys of the Milky Way. This new phase-space view of our
Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of
Milky-Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both
dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating
synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and
use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data
structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three
cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the
Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which feature
self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin
stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies
and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to
generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by
assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 $M_{\odot}$) represents a single
stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the
simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to
produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational
properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the
complete simulation snapshot at $z = 0$ for each simulated galaxy. We describe
data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These
synthetic surveys provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis
methods and interpret Gaia data.

measurement on a quantum state. By using a sequence of non-projective
measurements on single state, we show a more robust method to certify unbounded
randomness than the protocol of Churchod et al., by moving to a one-sided
device independent scenario. This protocol also does not assume any specific
behaviour of the adversary trying to fool the participants in the protocol,
which is an advantage over previous steering based protocols. We present
numerical results which confirm the optimal functioning of this protocol in the
ideal case. Furthermore, we also study an experimental scenario to determine
the feasibility of the protocol in a realistic implementation. The effect of
depolarizing noise is examined, by studying a potential state produced by a
networked system of ion traps.

interatomic potential to approximate quantum-mechanical energies and an active

Our approach significantly reduces the amount of DFT calculations needed,
resorting to DFT only to produce the training data, while structural
optimization is performed using the interatomic potentials. Our approach is not
limited to one (or a small number of) lattice types (as is the case for cluster
expansion, for example) and can predict structures with lattice types not
present in the training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm by predicting the convex hull for the following three systems: Cu-Pd,
Co-Nb-V, and Al-Ni-Ti. Our method is three to four orders of magnitude faster
than conventional high-throughput DFT calculations and explores a wider range
of materials space. In all three systems, we found unreported stable structures
compared to the AFLOW database. Because our method is much cheaper and explores
much more of materials space than high-throughput methods or cluster expansion,
and because our interatomic potentials have a systematically improvable
accuracy compared to empirical potentials such as EAM, etc., it will have a
significant impact in the discovery of new alloy phases, particularly those
with three or more components.

crystalline structure and superfluidity, opens a new avenue for exploring
exotic quantum matters---supersolids. However, conclusive detection and further
exploration of a superstripe is still challenging in experiments because of its
short period, low visibility, fragility against magnetic field fluctuation or
short lifetime. Here we propose a scheme in a spin-orbit coupled BEC which
overcomes these obstacles and generates a robust magnetic superstripe phase,
with only spin (no total) density modulation due to the magnetic translational
symmetry, ready for direct real-space observation. In the scheme, two hyperfine
spin states are individually Raman coupled with a largely-detuned third state,
which induce a momentum-space separation between two lower band dispersions,
yielding an effective spin-1/2 system with tunable spin-orbit coupling and
Zeeman fields. Without effective Zeeman fields, spin-dependent interaction
dominates, yielding a magnetic superstripe phase with a long tunable period and
high visibility. Our scheme provides a platform for observing and exploring
exotic properties of superstripe phases as well as novel physics with tunable
spin-orbit coupling.

their radial transport through a protoplanetary disk (PPD) with magnetically
driven winds. While most of the previous analytical studies in this context
assume that the radial turbulent coefficient is equal to the vertical dust
diffusion coefficient, in the light of the results of recent numerical
simulations, we relax this assumption by adopting effective parametrisations of
the turbulent coefficients involved in terms of the strength of the magnetic
fields driving the wind. Theoretical studies have already pointed out that even
in the absence of winds, these coefficients are not necessarily equal, though
its consequences regarding pebble production have not been explored. In this
paper, we investigate the evolution of the pebble production line, the radial
mass flux of the pebbles and their corresponding surface density as a function
of the plasma parameter at the disk midplane. Our analysis explicitly
demonstrates that the presence of magnetically-driven winds in a PPD leads to
considerable reduction of the rate and duration of the pebble delivery. We show
that when the wind is strong, the core growth in mass due to the pebble
accretion is so slow that it is unlikely that a core could reach a pebble
isolation mass during a PPD lifetime. When the mass of a core reaches this
critical value, pebble accretion is halted due to core-driven perturbations in
the gas. With decreasing wind strength, however, pebble accretion may, in a
shorter time, increase the mass of a core to the pebble isolation mass.

architecture -- prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), that reasons in a
similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and
combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The model
thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists,
physicians, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging
image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for
training without any annotations for parts of images. We demonstrate our method
on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and the Stanford Cars dataset. Our experiments show
that ProtoPNet can achieve comparable accuracy with its analogous
non-interpretable counterpart, and when several ProtoPNets are combined into a
larger network, it can achieve an accuracy that is on par with some of the
best-performing deep models. Moreover, ProtoPNet provides a level of
interpretability that is absent in other interpretable deep models.

(SFE) is strongly affected by internal stellar feedback processes. In this
paper we determine how sensitive the SFE of molecular clouds is to randomised
inputs in the star formation feedback loop, and to what extent relationships
between emergent cloud properties and the SFE can be recovered. We introduce
the yule suite of 26 radiative magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations of a
10,000 solar mass cloud similar to those in the solar neighbourhood. We use the
same initial global properties in every simulation but vary the initial mass
function (IMF) sampling and initial cloud velocity structure. The final SFE
lies between 6 and 23 percent when either of these parameters are changed. We
use Bayesian mixed-effects models to uncover trends in the SFE. The number of
photons emitted early in the cluster's life and the length of the cloud provide
are the strongest predictors of the SFE. The HII regions evolve following an
analytic model of expansion into a roughly isothermal density field. The more
efficient feedback is at evaporating the cloud, the less the star cluster is
dispersed. We argue that this is because if the gas is evaporated slowly, the
stars are dragged outwards towards surviving gas clumps due to the
gravitational attraction between the stars and gas. While star formation and
feedback efficiencies are dependent on nonlinear processes, statistical models
describing cloud-scale processes can be constructed.

product homotopy method requires deformation of $O(1)$ linear equations, while
existing homotopy methods for MEPs require $O(n)$ nonlinear equations. We show
that the fiber product homotopy method theoretically finds all eigenpairs of an
MEP with probability one. It is especially well-suited for dimension-deficient
singular MEPs, a weakness of all other existing methods, as the fiber product
homotopy method is provably convergent with probability one for such problems
as well, a fact borne out by numerical experiments. More generally, our
numerical experiments indicate that the fiber product homotopy method
significantly outperforms the standard Delta method in terms of accuracy, with
consistent backward errors on the order of $10^{-16}$, even for
dimension-deficient singular problems, and without any use of extended
precision. In terms of speed, it significantly outperforms previous
homotopy-based methods on all problems and outperforms the Delta method on
larger problems, and is also highly parallelizable. We show that the fiber

mathematically equivalent to a standard MEP, is typically a much better
conditioned problem.

powerful methodology for studying a broad range of stochastic differential
equations. Yet its complexity for systems subject to the white noise remains
significant. The issue appears due to the fact that the random increments
generated by the Brownian motion, result in a growing set of random variables
with respect to which the process could be measured. In order to cope with this
high dimensionality, we present a novel transformation of stochastic processes
driven by the white noise. In particular, we show that under suitable
assumptions, the diffusion arising from white noise can be cast into a
logarithmic gradient induced by the measure of the process. Through this
transformation, the resulting equation describes a stochastic process whose
randomness depends only upon the initial condition. Therefore the stochasticity
of the transformed system lives in the initial condition and thereby it can be
treated conveniently with the chaos expansion tools.

clusters) which produce local anti-gravity sources. In this cosmological model

Asymptotically Safe model is confronted with the most recent observational data
from low-redshift probes, namely measurements of the Hubble parameter, standard
candles (Pantheon SnIa, Quasi-stellar objects), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations

viable and very efficient cosmological alternative.

very wide and embraces Poisson distributions, negative binomial distributions,
Sichel distributions, Weibull--Poisson distributions and many other types of

distributions seem to be very promising for the statistical description of many
real phenomena. GG distributions are widely applied in signal and image

the methods of moments or maximum likelihood can be used as well as two-stage
grid EM-algorithms. The paper presents a methodology based on the search for
the best distribution using the minimization of $\ell^p$-distances and
$L^p$-metrics for GNB and GG distributions, respectively. This approach, first,
allows to obtain parameter estimates without using grid methods and solving
systems of nonlinear equations and, second, yields not point estimates as the

impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works
have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse. The
theoretical work of Arora et al. suggests a dilemma about GANs' statistical
properties: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak
discriminators cannot detect mode collapse.
  By contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn
distributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with
polynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong
distinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against
all possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of
Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible and injective neural networks
generators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets
of specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM)
induced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance
and/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the
learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance
or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes. Our preliminary experiments show
that on synthetic datasets the test IPM is well correlated with KL divergence
or the Wasserstein distance, indicating that the lack of diversity in GANs may
be caused by the sub-optimality in optimization instead of statistical
inefficiency.

find an oscillation associated with a breakdown orbit enclosing one electron

represents an experimental confirmation of the momentum space analog of Klein
tunneling. When the c-axis and the magnetic field are misaligned with respect

extract the cyclotron masses from the temperature dependence of the

These complexities arise due to changes in material properties at an immersed

Consequently, the solution and its gradient can be discontinuous, and numerical
methods can be difficult to design. Here a new method is presented and
analyzed, using a simple formulation of one-dimensional finite differences on a

microwave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder
measurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 2\%$
respectively. A $3$-$\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two
measurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood. Gravitational wave
(GW) sources accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts offer a
completely independent standard siren (the GW analogue of an astronomical
standard candle) measurement of $H_0$, as demonstrated following the discovery
of the neutron star merger, GW170817. This measurement does not assume a
cosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first
joint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a
measurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\%$
credible interval). In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between
the source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the
$H_0$ measurement uncertainty. Recently, Mooley et al. (2018) obtained tight
constraints on the viewing angle using high angular resolution imaging of the
radio counterpart of GW170817. Here we obtain a significantly improved

represented as a canonical two-part power law function and is largely invariant
for star formation regions evident in the Local Group of galaxies. The IMF is a
hilfskonstrukt. It is a mathematical formulation of an idealised population of
stars formed together in one star formation event. The nature of the IMF (is it
a probability density or an optimal sampling distribution function?) is raised.
Binary stars, if unresolved, have a very significant influence at low stellar
masses. Especially important is to take care of the changing binary fraction as
a result of stellar-dynamical evolution of the embedded clusters which spawn
the field populations of galaxies, given that the binary fraction at birth is
very high and independent of primary-star mass. The high multiplicity fraction
amongst massive stars leads to a substantial fraction of these being ejected
out of their birth clusters and to massive stars merging. This explains the
top-lightness of the IMF in star clusters in M31. In close binaries also the
masses of the components can be changed due to mass transfer. A large amount of
evidence points to the IMF becoming top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and
above a star-formation-rate density of about 0.1 Msun/(pc^3 yr) of the
cluster-forming cloud core. This is also indicated through the observed
supernova rates in star-bursting galaxies. At the same time, the IMF may be
bottom light at low metallicity and bottom-heavy at high metallicity, possibly
accounting for the results on elliptical galaxies and ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies, respectively.

and direct link between dark matter and neutrino physics is achieved by
considering the freeze-in production mechanism of dark matter. We show that the
neutrino Yukawa couplings which describe neutrino mass and mixing may also play
a dominant role in the dark matter production. We investigate the allowed
regions in the parameter space of the model that provide the correct neutrino
masses and mixing and simultaneously give the correct dark matter relic
abundance. In certain cases the right-handed neutrino mass may be arbitrarily
large, for example in the range $10^{10}-10^{11}$ GeV required for vanilla
leptogenesis, with a successful relic density arising from frozen-in dark
matter particles with masses around this scale, which we refer to as

axion-like field (ULA), with a range of potentials
$V(\phi)\propto[1-\cos(\phi/f)]^n$ set by the axion-field value $\phi$ and
decay constant $f$. Scalar field dynamics dictate that the field is initially
frozen and then begins to oscillate around its minimum when the Hubble
parameter drops below some critical value. For $n\!=\!1$, once dynamical, the
axion energy density dilutes as matter; for $n\!=\!2$ it dilutes as radiation
and for $n\!=\!3$ it dilutes faster than radiation. Both the homogeneous
evolution of the ULA and the dynamics of its linear perturbations are included,
using an effective fluid approximation generalized from the usual $n=1$ case.
ULA models are parameterized by the redshift $z_c$ when the field becomes
dynamical, the fractional energy density $f_{z_c} \equiv
\Omega_a(z_c)/\Omega_{\rm tot}(z_c)$ in the axion field at $z_c$, and the
effective sound speed $c_s^2$. Using Planck, BAO and JLA data, constraints on
$f_{z_c}$ are obtained. ULAs are degenerate with dark energy for all three
potentials if $1+z_c \lesssim 10$. When $3\times10^4 \gtrsim 1+z_c \gtrsim 10
$, $f_{z_c}$ is constrained to be $ \lesssim 0.004 $ for $n=1$ and $f_{z_c}

Discoveries in the local Universe (i.e. $z<0.1$) are scarce, but afford dense
multi-wavelength observations. Additional low-redshift objects are therefore
extremely valuable. We present early-time observations of the type I SLSN
ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz. These data are used to characterise the event and
compare to literature SLSNe and spectral models. Host galaxy properties are
also analysed. Optical and near-IR photometry and spectroscopy were analysed.
Early-time ATLAS photometry was used to constrain the rising light curve. We
identified a number of spectral features in optical-wavelength spectra and
tracked their time evolution. Finally, we used archival host galaxy photometry
together with HII region spectra to constrain the host environment.
ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz is found to be a type I SLSN in a galaxy at a redshift
of 0.0267 (111 Mpc), making it the lowest-redshift event discovered to date.
Strong CII lines are identified in the spectra. Spectral models produced by
exploding a Wolf-Rayet progenitor and injecting a magnetar power source are
shown to be qualitatively similar to ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz, contrary to most
SLSNe-I that display weak/non-existent CII lines. ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz

faster rise to maximum. The host has an absolute magnitude of --19.8 mag ($r$),
a mass of M$_{*}$ = 1.5$^{+0.08}_{-0.33}$ $\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ , and a

$M_H\lesssim 3 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}/h$ satellites exhibit a power law
profile with slope -3. Because these halos dominate the small scale clustering,
the resulting 1-halo term is steeper than predicted using standard NFW
profiles. Using this power-law profile for satellites, we can successfully
reproduce the small-scale clustering exhibited by BlueTides galaxies using HOD

proper size distribution. We find indications that GRB-SNe on average occur
closer to the centres of their host galaxies, i.e. the samples have a different

we compare gas-phase metallicities of the GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL host samples

interaction between a jet and a homologous outflow produced dynamically during
binary neutron star mergers. We quantify how the thermal energy supplied by the
jet to the ejecta and the ability of a jet to escape the homologous ejecta
depend on the parameters of the jet engine and the ejecta. For collimated jets
initiated at early times compared to the engine duration, we show that
successful breakout of the forward cocoon shock necessitates a jet that
successfully escapes the ejecta. This is because the ejecta is expanding and
absorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls
before it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented
only for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable
given short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes
of jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the
engine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late
breakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma
rays in GW 170817. We show that for the entire parameter space of jet
parameters surveyed here (covering energies $\sim 10^{48}-10^{51}$ ergs and
opening angles $\theta_j \sim 0.07-0.4$) the thermal energy deposited into the
ejecta by the jet propagation is less than that produced by r-process heating
on second timescales by a factor of $\gtrsim 10$. Shock heating is thus
energetically subdominant in setting the luminosity of thermally powered
transients coincident with neutron star mergers (kilonovae). For typical short
GRB jet parameters, our conclusion is stronger: there is little thermal energy
in the cocoon, much less than what is needed to explain the early blue
component of the kilonova in GW 170817.

cavity shapes the available modes and forms strongly-interacting polaritons
with enhanced light-matter coupling. However, since every atom of the same
species is identical, the atomic transitions available are only those
prescribed by nature. This inflexibility severely limits their utility for
mediating the formation of photonic materials in cavities, as the resonator
mode spectrum is typically poorly matched to the atomic spectrum. Here we use
Floquet engineering to redesign the spectrum of Rubidium and make it compatible
with the spectrum of a cavity, in order to explore strongly interacting
polaritons in a customized space. We show that periodically modulating the

lifetime-limited bands separated by multiples of the modulation frequency.
Simultaneously generating bands resonant with two chosen spatial modes of an
optical cavity supports ""Floquet polaritons"" in both modes. In the presence of

fast evolving supernovae that exhibit strong [Ca II] emission in their nebular
phase spectra. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up
observations of iPTF 16hgs -- an intermediate luminosity and fast evolving
transient that exhibited a double peaked light curve. Exhibiting a typical Type
Ib spectrum in the photospheric phase and an early transition to a [Ca II]
dominated nebular phase, we show that iPTF 16hgs shows properties consistent
with the class of Ca-rich gap transients, with two interesting exceptions.
First, while the second peak of the light curve is similar to other Ca-rich gap
transients (suggesting $M_{ej}$ of 0.4 M$_\odot$ and peak luminosity of $3
\times 10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), we show that the first blue and fast declining
(over $2$ days) peak is unique to this source. Second, with Integral Field Unit
observations of the host galaxy, we find that iPTF 16hgs occurred in the
outskirts (projected offset of $6$ kpc $ = 1.9 R_{eff}$) of a low metallicity
(0.4 Z$_\odot$), star forming, dwarf spiral galaxy. Using deep late-time VLA
and uGMRT observations, we place stringent limits on the local environment of
the source, ruling out a large parameter space of circumstellar densities and
mass loss environments of the progenitor. If iPTF 16hgs shares explosion
physics with the class of Ca-rich gap transients, the presence of the first
peak can be explained by enhanced mixing of 0.01 M$_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni into
the outer layers the ejecta, reminiscent of some models of He-shell detonations
on WDs. On the other hand, if iPTF 16hgs is physically unrelated to the class,
the first peak is consistent with shock cooling emission (of an envelope with a
mass of 0.08 M$_\odot$ and radius of 13 R$_\odot$) associated with a
core-collapse explosion of a highly stripped massive star in a close binary
system.

synthetic spectral models that use simple star formation recipes, we inferred
ages and metallicities of the stellar population at different locations within
each galaxy and characterized their influence on the radial color trends. We
measure that galaxy sizes are $\sim$ 25% smaller in the red $H_{160}$ filter

S\'{e}rsic index $n$ with wavelength. We find negative color gradients in all
colors with slopes ranging between -0.07 and -0.17 mag dex$^{-1}$ and with no
obvious dependence on total magnitude, stellar mass, or location inside the
cluster core. We explain the observed radial trends of color gradients as a
result of the ages and metallicities of the respective stellar populations. Red
galaxy cores are typically $\sim$ 3 Gyr older and more enriched in metals than
the galaxy outskirts, which are of solar metallicity.

experiments -- most recently corroborated by new data from MiniBooNE -- have
led to the hypothesis that extra, 'sterile', neutrino species might exist.
Models of this type face severe cosmological constraints, and several ideas
have been proposed to avoid these constraints. Among the most widely discussed
ones are models with so-called 'secret interactions' in the neutrino sector. In
these models, sterile neutrinos are hypothesized to couple to a new
interaction, which dynamically suppresses their production in the early
Universe through finite-temperature effects. Recently, it has been argued that
the original calculations demonstrating the viability of this scenario need to
be refined. Here, we update our earlier results from arXiv:1310.6337 [JCAP 1510
(2015) no.10, 011] accordingly. We confirm that much of the previously open
parameter space for secret interactions is in fact ruled out by cosmological
constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and on free-streaming of active
neutrinos. We then discuss possible modifications of the vanilla scenario that
would reconcile sterile neutrinos with cosmology.

synthetic S$^4$G-like galaxy images. DiskFit is unreliable in the bulge region,
but accurately disentangles exponential disks from Ferrers bars farther out as
long as their position angles differ by more than 5${^\circ}$. We then proceed
to model the S$^4$G galaxies, successfully fitting 489 of them using an
automated approach for initializing DiskFit, optimizing the model and deriving
uncertainties using a bootstrap-resampling technique. The resulting component
geometries and surface brightness profiles are compared to those derived by
Salo et al. (2015) using the parametric model galfit. We find generally good
agreement between the models, but discrepancies between best-fitting values for
individual systems are often significant: the choice of algorithm clearly
impacts the inferred disk and bar structure. In particular, we find that
DiskFit typically assigns more light to the bar and less light to the disk
relative to the Ferrers and exponential profiles presented by Salo et al.
(2015) in the bar region. Given DiskFit's reliability at disentangling these
components in our synthetic images, we conclude that the surface brightness
distributions of barred S$^4$G galaxies are not well-represented by these
functional forms. The results presented here underscore the importance of
validating photometric decomposition algorithms before applying them to real

in 2+1 dimensions and show that the fluid has a finite dc conductivity due to
boundary-induced momentum relaxation, even in the absence of impurities. We use
methods involving the AdS/CFT correspondence to examine the system in the

Moreover, we vary the coupling strength by varying $\eta/s$, the ratio of shear
viscosity over entropy density. We find that $dV/dI$ decreases when the
coupling is increased. We also find that strongly coupled fluids are more
likely to become ultra-relativistic and turbulent. These conclusions are

and their rotation rates in the core helium burning (secondary clump) phase can
therefore be used to test models of angular momentum loss used for
gyrochronology in a new regime. Because both their core and surface rotation
rates can be measured, these stars can also be used to set strong constraints
on angular momentum transport inside stars. We find that they are rotating
slower than angular momentum conservation and rigid rotation would predict. Our
results are insensitive to the degree of core-envelope coupling because of the
small moment of inertia of the radiative core. We discuss two possible
mechanisms for slowing down the surfaces of these stars: (1) substantial
angular momentum loss, and (2) radial differential rotation in the surface
convection zone. Modern angular momentum loss prescriptions used for solar-type
stars predict secondary clump surface rotation rates in much better agreement
with the data than prior variants used in the literature, and we argue that
such enhanced loss is required to understand the combination of core and
surface rotation rates. However, we find that the assumed radial differential
rotation profile in convective regions has a strong impact on the predicted
surface rotation rates, and that a combination of enhanced loss and radial
differential rotation in the surface convection zone is also consistent with
the data. We discuss future tests that can quantify the impact of both
phenomena. Current data tentatively suggests that some combination of the two
processes fits the data better than either one alone.

  Statistic analysis and theoretical estimations","17 pages, 23 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Close encounters (CEs) between celestial objects may exert significant
influence on their orbits. The influence will be even enhanced when two groups
of celestial objects are confined in stable orbital configurations, e.g. in
adjacent mean motion resonances (MMRs). Plutinos and Neptune Trojans, trapped
in the 2:3 and 1:1 MMRs with Neptune respectively, are such examples.
%Meanwhile, many objects among these two groups have peculiar orbits, seemingly
as the vestige of CEs. As the first part of our investigation, this paper
provides a detailed description of CEs between Plutinos and Trojans and their
potential influences on the Trojans' orbits. Statistical analyses of CE data
from numerical simulations reveal the randomness lying in the CEs between the
two planetesimals. The closest positions of CEs distribute symmetrically inside
the given CE region and no particular bias is found between the positive and
negative effects on the orbital elements of Trojans. Based on the Gaussian
approximation on the distribution of the velocity orientation of Plutino, and
the integral derivatives of Gaussian perturbation equations, a theoretical
method is built to estimate the CE effects. To further verify the randomness of
CEs, a Monte Carlo approach is applied, and it generates distribution features
consistent with the numerical results. In summary, CEs brought by realistic
Plutinos exert impartial effects and tiny total influence on the orbital
elements of Trojans. However, driven by the random walk mechanism, tiny effects
may accumulate to a prominent variation given sufficient CEs, which will be
discussed in the accompanying paper.

convection is confined to high latitude in both hemispheres but is only
restricted to one hemisphere close to the pole in the case of asymmetric waves.
This is in contrast to what is previously known from studies in the field.
These periodic flows, in which the pattern is rotating steadily in the

chemical composition. Forming planets take building material (solids) away from
the surrounding protoplanetary disc. Assuming that the disc's accretion onto
the star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere of the star
will show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming
planet(s). If planets are only forming around one star of a binary system, the
planet formation process can result in abundance differences in wide binary
stars, if their natal protoplanetary discs do not interact during planet
formation. Abundance differences in the atmospheres of wide binaries hosting
giant planets have already been observed and linked to the formation location
of giant planets. Here, we model how much building material is taken away for
super-Earth planets that form inside/outside of the water ice line as well as
ice giants forming inside/outside of the CO ice line. Our model predicts a
significant abundance difference $\Delta$[X/H] in the stellar atmospheres of
the planet-hosting binary component. Our model predicts that super-Earths that
form inside the water ice line ($r<r_{\rm H_2O}$) will result in an
$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$[O/H] abundance difference in the their host star that
is a factor of 2 larger than for super-Earths formed outside the water ice line
($r>r_{\rm H_2O}$) in the water rich parts of the disc. Additionally, our model
shows that the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$[C/H] abundance difference in the host
star is at least a factor of 3 larger for ice giants formed at $r<r_{\rm CO}$
compared to ice giants formed far out in the protoplanetary disc ($r>r_{\rm

transformations under the flavour symmetries are chosen in such a way that
naturally predicts the hierarchies of different elements of the seesaw mass
matrix and also keeps the unwanted terms away. For generic choices of flavon
alignments, the model predicts normal hierarchical light neutrino masses with
the atmospheric mixing angle in the lower octant. Apart from predicting
interesting correlations between different neutrino parameters as well as
between neutrino and model parameters, the model also predicts the leptonic
Dirac CP phase to lie in a specific range $-\pi/2\lesssim \delta \lesssim
-\pi/5$ and $\pi/5\lesssim \delta \lesssim \pi/2$ that includes the currently
preferred maximal value. The predictions for the absolute neutrino masses in
one specific version of the model can also saturate the cosmological upper
bound on sum of absolute neutrino masses.

However, this idea has been challenged in the last years by gas detections in
some systems. We compiled a database of 301 debris disks and collected
high--resolution optical spectra for $\sim77\%$ of them. From the analysis of
these data we identified a group of 23 debris disks presenting several
absorption features superimposed to the photospheric Ca II and Na I doublets.
These absorptions could be due to circumstellar material or interstellar
clouds. In order to discriminate between the two scenarios, we characterized
each feature in terms of its radial velocity, equivalent width and column
density. Additionally, we searched in the literature for local clouds in the
line of sight of the stars, and looked for the presence of similar absorption
features in nearby stars. Our study concludes that while all the objects
present interstellar absorptions in their spectra, three objects show features
more compatible with circumstellar origin: HD 110058 presents a stable
circumstellar absorption, while HR 4796 and c Aql present variable absorption
features likely due to exocometary activity. The minute-scale variability we
detect towards c Aql is the shortest of this kind detected so far. The
detection of circumstellar features in these objects is consistent with their
near edge-on inclinations. We also provide evidence challenging previous claims
of circumstellar gas detections for HR 6507. Given the properties of the
sample, we speculate that transient gaseous events must be a common phenomenon
among debris disks.

circumgalactic medium (CGM) is multiphase and dynamic. Recent state-of-the-art
cosmological galaxy simulations have generally underproduced the column density
of cold halo gas. We argue that this may be due to a mismatch of spatial
resolution in the circumgalactic space and the relevant physical scales at
which the cold gas operates. Using semi-analytic calculations and a set of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we present a multiphase model of the
gaseous halos around galaxies, the circumgalactic mist (CGm). The CGm model is
based on the idea that the observed cold halo gas may be a composite of cold,
dense and small cloudlets embedded in a hot diffuse halo, resembling
terrestrial clouds and mist. We show that the resulting cold gas from thermal
instabilities conforms to a characteristic column density of $N_{\rm H}\approx
10^{17}\rm{cm^{-2}}$ as predicted by the $c_s t_{\rm cool}$ ansatz. The model
implies a large number of cold clumps in the inner galactic halo with a small
volume filling factor but large covering fraction. The model also naturally
gives rise to spatial extents and differential covering fractions of cold, warm
and hot gas. To self-consistently model the co-evolution of the CGM and star
formation within galaxies, future simulations must address the mismatch of the
spatial resolution and characteristic scale of cold gas.

properties of neutrinos, including whether or not the neutrino and antineutrino
are distinct. Double beta detectors are large and expensive, so background
reduction is essential for extracting the highest sensitivity. The
identification, or 'tagging', of the $^{136}$Ba daughter atom from double beta
decay of $^{136}$Xe provides a technique for eliminating backgrounds in the
nEXO neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. The tagging scheme studied in
this work utilizes a cryogenic probe to trap the barium atom in solid xenon,
where the barium atom is tagged via fluorescence imaging in the solid xenon
matrix. Here we demonstrate imaging and counting of individual atoms of barium
in solid xenon by scanning a focused laser across a solid xenon matrix
deposited on a sapphire window. When the laser sits on an individual atom, the
fluorescence persists for $\sim$30~s before dropping abruptly to the background
level, a clear confirmation of one-atom imaging. No barium fluorescence
persists following evaporation of a barium deposit to a limit of $\leq$0.16\%.
This is the first time that single atoms have been imaged in solid noble
element. It establishes the basic principle of a barium tagging technique for
nEXO.

in the perturbation expansion, infrared sensitivity. As a result, a
perturbative analysis can at best provide an estimate of these quantities,
subject to some uncertainty. The size of these uncertainties, particularly in
the case of $\chi$, has been the subject of some debate. For the perturbative
free energy, reframing an analysis of Braaten and Pisarski, the estimate and
the associated error, can be understood in terms of a {\it Wilsonian} effective
action for the low energy effective three dimensional theory. This action can
be obtained completely from a perturbative calculation, which terminates at a
finite order. This action provides the desired estimate. The size of the error
follows from dimensional analysis in the low energy theory. The Debye length
computation and its error can be obtained from a similar study of a
non-relativistic effective theory for an adjoint scalar in three dimensions.
$\chi$ requires a four dimensional analysis involving finite temperature
instantons, but again the dominant sources of uncertainty are three
dimensional, and we provide a procedure to estimate and an associated error.
This uncertainty is of order $g^4 $ relative to the leading semiclassical
result, and in situations of interest is small.

DeepTag also learns to abstain in examples when it is uncertain and defers them
to human experts, resulting in improved performance. DeepTag accurately infers
disease codes from free text even in challenging cross-hospital settings where
the text comes from different clinical settings than the ones used for

unphysical amplifier property is achievable for a class of probabilistic
amplifiers that does not work deterministically. Here we present a linear
amplification scheme that realises this property for coherent states by
combining a heralded measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier and a
deterministic linear amplifier. The concatenation of two amplifiers introduces
the flexibility that allows one to tune between the regimes of high-gain or
high noise-reduction, and control the trade-off of these performances against a
finite heralding probability. We demonstrate an amplification signal transfer
coefficient of $\mathcal{T}_s > 1$ with no statistical distortion of the output
state. By partially relaxing the demand of output Gaussianity, we can obtain
further improvement to achieve a $\mathcal{T}_s = 2.55 \pm 0.08$. Our
amplification scheme only relies on linear optics and post-selection algorithm.
We discuss the potential of using this amplifier as a building block in
extending the distance of quantum communication.

model-based optimization or discriminative inference learning. However, when
the input LR face is tiny, the learned prior knowledge is no longer effective
and their performance will drop sharply. To solve this problem, in this paper
we propose a general face hallucination method that can integrate model-based
optimization and discriminative inference. In particular, to exploit the model
based prior, the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) denoiser prior is
plugged into the super-resolution optimization model with the aid of
image-adaptive Laplacian regularization. Additionally, we further develop a
high-frequency details compensation method by dividing the face image to facial
components and performing face hallucination in a multi-layer neighbor
embedding manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve
promising super-resolution results for tiny input LR faces.

nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to specify it a priori. Current
statistical methodologies for modeling these processes are often highly

from the dynamical systems and engineering literature referred to as an echo

so-called ""deep"" models have recently been shown to be successful at predicting
high-dimensional complex nonlinear processes, particularly those with multiple
spatial and temporal scales of variability (such as we often find in
spatio-temporal environmental data). Here we introduce a deep ensemble ESN

The first approach utilizes a bootstrap ensemble framework and the second is
developed within a hierarchical Bayesian framework (BD-EESN). This more general
hierarchical Bayesian framework naturally accommodates non-Gaussian data types

domains, learning directly from high-dimensional sensory streams. However, when
neural networks are trained in a fixed environment, such as a single level in a
video game, they will usually overfit and fail to generalize to new levels.
When RL models overfit, even slight modifications to the environment can result
in poor agent performance. This paper explores how procedurally generated
levels during training can increase generality. We show that for some games
procedural level generation enables generalization to new levels within the
same distribution. Additionally, it is possible to achieve better performance
with less data by manipulating the difficulty of the levels in response to the
performance of the agent. The generality of the learned behaviors is also
evaluated on a set of human-designed levels. The results suggest that the
ability to generalize to human-designed levels highly depends on the design of
the level generators. We apply dimensionality reduction and clustering
techniques to visualize the generators' distributions of levels and analyze to
what degree they can produce levels similar to those designed by a human.

gravitational wave signals, a problem which arises in two different contexts.
For space-based detectors like LISA, the orbital motion of the detector
introduces a time-dependency in the response of the detector, consisting of
both a modulation and a varying delay. In the context of signals from
precessing spinning binary systems, a useful tool for building models of the
waveform consists in representing the signal as a time-dependent rotation of a
quasi-non-precessing waveform. In both cases, being able to compute transfer
functions for these effects directly in the Fourier domain may enable
performance gains for data analysis applications by using fast frequency-domain
waveforms. Our results generalize previous approaches based on the stationary
phase approximation for inspiral signals, extending them by including delays
and computing corrections beyond the leading order, while being applicable to
the broader class of inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. In the LISA case, we
find that a leading-order treatment is accurate for high-mass and low-mass
signals that are chirping fast enough, with errors consistently reduced by the
corrections we derived. By contrast, low-mass binary black holes, if far away
from merger and slowly-chirping, cannot be handled by this formalism and we
develop another approach for these systems. In the case of precessing binaries,
we explore the merger-ringdown range for a handful of cases, using a simple
model for the post-merger precession. We find that deviations from leading
order can give large fractional errors, while affecting mainly subdominant
modes and giving rise to a limited unfaithfulness in the full waveform.
Including higher-order corrections consistently reduces the unfaithfulness, and
we further develop an alternative approach to accurately represent post-merger
features.

  June, 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An efficient two-layer coding method using the histogram packing technique
with the backward compatibility to the legacy JPEG is proposed in this paper.
The JPEG XT, which is the international standard to compress HDR images, adopts
two-layer coding scheme for backward compatibility to the legacy JPEG. However,
this two-layer coding structure does not give better lossless performance than
the other existing single-layer coding methods for HDR images. Moreover, the
JPEG XT has problems on determination of the lossless coding parameters;
Finding appropriate combination of the parameter values is necessary to achieve
good lossless performance. The histogram sparseness of HDR images is discussed
and it is pointed out that the histogram packing technique considering the
sparseness is able to improve the performance of lossless compression for HDR
images and a novel two-layer coding with the histogram packing technique is
proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that not only the proposed
method has a better lossless compression performance than that of the JPEG XT,
but also there is no need to determine image-dependent parameter values for
good compression performance in spite of having the backward compatibility to
the well known legacy JPEG standard.

respect to the optimal regulator, which reflects the increase in the operating
cost due to uncertainty about the dynamics parameters. However, available
results in the literature do not provide a quantitative characterization of the
effect of the unknown parameters on the regret. Further, there are problems
regarding the efficient implementation of some of the existing adaptive
policies. Finally, results regarding the accuracy with which the system's
parameters are identified are scarce and rather incomplete.
  This study aims to comprehensively address these three issues. First, by
introducing a novel decomposition of adaptive policies, we establish a sharp
expression for the regret of an arbitrary policy in terms of the deviations
from the optimal regulator. Second, we show that adaptive policies based on
slight modifications of the Certainty Equivalence scheme are efficient.
Specifically, we establish a regret of (nearly) square-root rate for two
families of randomized adaptive policies. The presented regret bounds are
obtained by using anti-concentration results on the random matrices employed
for randomizing the estimates of the unknown parameters. Moreover, we study the
minimal additional information on dynamics matrices that using them the regret
will become of logarithmic order. Finally, the rates at which the unknown
parameters of the system are being identified are presented.

supporting IPv6 connectivity through 6LoWPAN, a set of standards which specify
how to aggressively compress IPv6 packets over low-power wireless links such as

  We find that different low-power IPv6 stacks are unable to communicate using

efficiency. We argue that applying traditional protocol design principles to
low-power networks is responsible for these failures, in part because receivers
must accommodate a wide range of senders.
  Based on these findings, we propose three design principles for Internet

importance of providing flexible tradeoffs between code size and energy

networks exploiting partially overlapping channels (POCs). For general
data-collection tasks in UAV networks, we aim to optimize the network
throughput with constraints on transmission power and quality of service (QoS).
As far as the highly mobile and constantly changing UAV networks are concerned,
unfortunately, most existing methods rely on definite information which is
vulnerable to the dynamic environment, rendering system performance to be less
effective. In order to combat dynamic topology and varying interference of UAV
networks, a robust and distributed learning scheme is proposed. Rather than the
perfect channel state information (CSI), we introduce uncertainties to
characterize the dynamic channel gains among UAV nodes, which are then
interpreted with fuzzy numbers. Instead of the traditional observation space
where the channel capacity is a crisp reward, we implement the learning and
decision process in a mapped fuzzy space. This allows the system to achieve a
smoother and more robust performance by optimizing in an alternate space. To
this end, we design a fuzzy payoffs function (FPF) to describe the fluctuated
utility, and the problem of POCs assignment is formulated as a fuzzy payoffs
game (FPG). Assisted by an attractive property of fuzzy bi-matrix games, the
existence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium (FNE) for our formulated FPG is proved. Our
robust fuzzy-learning algorithm could reach the equilibrium solution via a
least-deviation method. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to
demonstrate the advantages of our new scheme over the existing scheme.

multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications
by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations, where the
low-fidelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-fidelity model (e.g., a

maintains complex arrhythmias such as atrial and ventricular fibrillation. The
aim of the present study was to quantify the complex dynamics of spiral waves
as the organizing manifolds of information flow at multiple scales. We
simulated spiral waves using a numerical model of cardiac excitation in a
two-dimensional (2-D) lattice. We created a renormalization group by coarse
graining and re-scaling the original time series in multiple spatiotemporal
scales, and quantified the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) of the
information flow underlying the spiral waves. To quantify the scale-invariant
structures, we compared the value of finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE)
between the corresponding components of the 2-D lattice in each spatiotemporal
scale of the renormalization group with that of the original scale. Both the
repelling and the attracting LCS changed across the different spatial and
temporal scales of the renormalization group. However, despite the change
across the scales, some LCS were scale-invariant. The patterns of those
scale-invariant structures were not obvious from the trajectory of the spiral
waves based on voltage mapping of the lattice. Some Lagrangian coherent
structures of information flow underlying spiral waves are preserved across
multiple spatiotemporal scales.

flexibility, as different choices of the approximate function lead to different

important characteristics: the finite speed propagation of the free boundary

Based on different dissipative energy laws, we develop two numerical schemes by
an energetic variational approach. Firstly, based on $f \log f$ as the total
energy form of the dissipative law, we obtain the trajectory equation, and then
construct a fully discrete scheme. It is proved that the scheme is uniquely
solvable on an admissible convex set by taking the advantage of the singularity
of the total energy. Next, based on $\frac{1}{2 f}$ as the total energy form of
the dissipation law, we construct a linear numerical scheme for the
corresponding trajectory equation. Both schemes preserve the corresponding
discrete dissipation law. Meanwhile, under some smoothness assumption, it is
proved, by a higher order expansion technique, that both schemes are
second-order convergent in space and first-order convergent in time. Each
scheme yields a good approximation for the solution and the free boundary. No
oscillation is observed for the numerical solution around the free boundary.
Furthermore, the waiting time problem could be naturally treated, which has
been a well-known difficult issue for all the existence methods. Due to its
linear nature, the second scheme is more efficient.

portraits of the analyzed structures that are composed of bands lying in the

In particular, the number N of bands composing the nonlinear spectrum
determines the genus g = N - 1 of the solution that can be viewed as a measure
of complexity of the space-time evolution of the considered solution. Within
this setting the ideal, rational Peregrine soliton represents a special,

approximated by the Peregrine solitons, nonlinear spectral analysis of the

  Detector With Support For Unsupervised Learning","6 pages, 3 figures, AI for Fashion, KDD 2018",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the proliferation of social media, fashion inspired from celebrities,
reputed designers as well as fashion influencers has shortened the cycle of
fashion design and manufacturing. However, with the explosion of fashion
related content and large number of user generated fashion photos, it is an
arduous task for fashion designers to wade through social media photos and
create a digest of trending fashion. This necessitates deep parsing of fashion
photos on social media to localize and classify multiple fashion items from a
given fashion photo. While object detection competitions such as MSCOCO have
thousands of samples for each of the object categories, it is quite difficult
to get large labeled datasets for fast fashion items. Moreover,
state-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large
amount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object
detectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic
object detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24
categories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the
base architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K
unlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then
subsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset.
On 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K
photos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art
object detectors. We show that this improvement is due to our choice of
architecture that lets us do unsupervised learning and that performs
significantly better in identifying small objects.

recovery via truncated norm minimization $\min_{x}\|x_T\|_q$ and
$\min_{X}\|X_T\|_{S_q}$ from noisy measurements. We first introduce truncated
sparse approximation property, a more general robust null space property, and
establish the stable recovery of signals and matrices under the truncated
sparse approximation property. We also explore the relationship between the
restricted isometry property and truncated sparse approximation property. And
we also prove that if a measurement matrix $A$ or linear map $\mathcal{A}$
satisfies truncated sparse approximation property of order $k$, then the first
inequality in restricted isometry property of order $k$ and of order $2k$ can
hold for certain different constants $\delta_{k}$ and $\delta_{2k}$,
respectively. Last, we show that if $\delta_{t(k+|T^c|)}<\sqrt{(t-1)/t}$ for
some $t\geq 4/3$, then measurement matrix $A$ and linear map $\mathcal{A}$
satisfy truncated sparse approximation property of order $k$. Which should
point out is that when $T^c=\emptyset$, our conclusion implies that sparse
approximation property of order $k$ is weaker than restricted isometry property
of order $tk$.

polynomial of abelian varieties. First, we prove a relation between $n$ and
$e$, where $e$ is a certain multiplicity associated with a simple abelian
variety of arbitrary dimension over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Second, we explicitly
describe the characteristic polynomials of simple abelian varieties of
arbitrary dimension $g$, when $e=g$. Finally, we explicitly describe the

cumulative coherence condition for three class matrices, in terms of the

$\mathfrak{g}_*$ be a $\mathbf{Z}/m$-grading on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.
In a recent series of articles, G. Lusztig and Z. Yun, studied the
classification of simple $G_0$-equivariant perverse sheaves on the nilpotent
cone of $\mathfrak{g}_i$ for $i\in \mathbf{Z}/m$, where $G_0$ is the
exponentiation of the degree zero piece $\mathfrak{g}_0$. They proved a
decomposition of the equivariant derived category of $\ell$-adic sheaves on the
nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{g}_i$ into blocks, each generated by a certain
cuspidal local system via {\itshape spiral inductions}. We prove a conjecture
of them, which predicts the bijectivity of a map from 1) the set of simple
perverse sheaves in a fixed block to 2) the set of simple modules of a block of
a (trigonometric) degenerate double affine Hecke algebra (dDAHA). This is a
dDAHA analogue of the Deligne--Langlands correspondence for affine Hecke
algebras proven by Kazhdan--Lusztig. Our results generalise a previous work of
E. Vasserot, where the perverse sheaves in the principal block were considered.

  Learning (PAL-18)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to real-life
problems is that the amount of train-and-error required to learn a good policy
increases drastically as the task becomes complex. One potential solution to
this problem is to combine reinforcement learning with automated symbol
planning and utilize prior knowledge on the domain. However, existing methods
have limitations in their applicability and expressiveness. In this paper we
propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method based on abductive
symbolic planning. The planner can deal with user-defined evaluation functions
and is not based on the Herbrand theorem. Therefore it can utilize prior
knowledge of the rewards and can work in a domain where the state space is
unknown. We demonstrate empirically that our architecture significantly
improves learning efficiency with respect to the amount of training examples on
the evaluation domain, in which the state space is unknown and there exist
multiple goals.

study, and revealed the inter-provincial disparity and regional disparity of
economic development and their evolution trends from 1952-2000. The results
shows that (a) Regional disparity in economic development in China, including
the inter-provincial disparity, inter-regional disparity and intra-regional
disparity, has existed for years; (b) Gini coefficient and Theil coefficient
have revealed a similar dynamic trend for comparative disparity in economic
development between provinces in China. From 1952 to 1978, except for the
""Great Leap Forward"" period, comparative disparity basically assumes a upward
trend and it assumed a slowly downward trend from 1979 to1990. Afterwards from
1991 to 2000 the disparity assumed a slowly upward trend again; (c) A
comparison between Shanghai and Guizhou shows that absolute inter-provincial
disparity has been quite big for years; and (d) The Hurst exponent (H=0.5) in
the period of 1966-1978 indicates that the comparative inter-provincial
disparity of economic development showed a random characteristic, and in the
Hurst exponent (H>0.5) in period of 1979-2000 indicates that in this period the

is the ability to fabricate three-dimensional micro-devices integrating
optical, mechanical or fluid handling functions in a single substrate. In this
context, amorphous SiO2 is the most widely studied material. Here we show that
short (50-fs) femtosecond pulses induce the separation of Si and O ions in SiO2
substrates, leading to the formation of micro-crystallites that we identify as
pure crystalline phase of Si. Interestingly, this polymorphic phase
transformation occurs in the absence of laser-induced confined microexplosion
and with moderate numerical aperture. These findings not only unravel a key
mechanism related to the transformation of the material and its subsequent
properties, but also pave the road for the development of three-dimensional
Si-rich structures embedded in a pure silica phase, eventually leading to novel
disruptive approaches for fabricating three- dimensional micro-devices. For
instance, one could imagine a silica-host substrate, in which arbitrary
three-dimensional silicon-based components are direct-write using a femtosecond
laser, rather than through assembly of components coming out of different
substrates or using multiple processing steps.

exploited during training. In large-scale datasets, data does not span the full
label space, but instead lies in a low-dimensional output manifold. Following
this observation, we embed the targets into a low-dimensional space,
drastically improving convergence speed while preserving accuracy. Our
contribution is two fold: (i) We show that random projections of the label
space are a valid tool to find such lower dimensional embeddings, boosting
dramatically convergence rates at zero computational cost; and (ii) we propose
a normalized eigenrepresentation of the class manifold that encodes the targets
with minimal information loss, improving the accuracy of random projections

in the zero-temperature limit, as a power-law on $V$ for both Dirac and chiral
KSLs, but with different exponents. Lastly, we study the longitudinal spin
Seebeck effect, in which a spin current is driven by the combined action of a
magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the honeycomb lattice and a

networking that are prone to threats of cyberattacks, which challenges power
system reliability and efficiency. Thus, significant attention should be paid
to the Smart Grids security. Recently, it has been proven that False Data
Injection Attacks (FDIA) could corrupt results of State Estimation (SE) without

low computational effort so that it can be run online, and it is suitable for
implementation in existing or new ad-hoc low-cost devices. The proposed
algorithm could be helpful to increase power system awareness against FDIA
complementing the current SE implementations. The efficiency of the proposed

PSCAD software. Our results show that the proposed methodology can detect
cyberattacks to the SE in 99.9% of the cases with very little false alarms on

Hellinger distance-based measure of non-classical correlation, which not only
inherits the nice properties of the Hellinger distance including contractivity,
and but also shows a powerful analytic computability for a large class of
quantum states. We show that there is an explicit trade-off relation satisfied
by the quantum coherence and this non-classical correlation.

phenomenon occurring in biological, physical and social processes. The identity
of the abelian group is a fractal composed of self-similar patches, and its
limit is subject of extensive collaborative research. Here, we analyze the
evolution of the sandpile identity under harmonic fields of different orders.
We show that this evolution corresponds to periodic cycles through the abelian
group characterized by the smooth transformation and apparent conservation of
the patches constituting the identity. The dynamics induced by second and third
order harmonics resemble smooth stretchings, respectively translations, of the
identity, while the ones induced by fourth order harmonics resemble
magnifications and rotations. Starting with order three, the dynamics pass
through extended regions of seemingly random configurations which spontaneously
reassemble into accentuated patterns. We show that the space of harmonic
functions projects to the extended analogue of the sandpile group, thus
providing a set of universal coordinates identifying configurations between
different domains. Since the original sandpile group is a subgroup of the
extended one, this directly implies that it admits a natural renormalization.
Furthermore, we show that the harmonic fields can be induced by simple Markov
processes, and that the corresponding stochastic dynamics show remarkable
robustness over hundreds of periods. Finally, we encode information into
seemingly random configurations, and decode this information with an algorithm
requiring minimal prior knowledge. Our results suggest that harmonic fields
might split the sandpile group into sub-sets showing different critical
coefficients, and that it might be possible to extend the fractal structure of
the identity beyond the boundaries of its domain.

constrain cosmological parameters in $\Lambda CDM$ model with 3 massive active

from Planck strengthens this bound to $\sum m_{\nu} <$ 0.118 eV, which is very
close to the minimum required mass of $\sum m_{\nu} \simeq$ 0.1 eV for inverted
hierarchy. This bound is reduced to $\sum m_{\nu} <$ 0.110 eV when we also vary
r, the tensor to scalar ratio ($\Lambda CDM+r+\sum m_{\nu}$ model), and add an
additional dataset, BK14, the latest data released from the Bicep-Keck

cosmology with non-phantom dynamical dark energy ($w_0 w_a CDM+\sum m_{\nu}$

reduced to $\sum m_{\nu} <$ 0.093 eV. For the $w_0 w_a CDM+\sum m_{\nu}$ model
without any constraint on $w(z)$, the bounds however relax to $\sum m_{\nu} <$
0.276 eV. Adding a prior on the Hubble constant ($H_0 = 73.24\pm 1.74$

further improve to $\sum m_{\nu} <$ 0.117 eV, 0.091 eV, 0.085 eV, 0.082 eV,

Therefore, The classifier accuracy is used as a proxy to evaluate if the

Even though approximate analysis for the hit rate has been studied for LRU, the
analysis does not extend to gLRU since the metric of interest is no longer the
hit rate as the cache has partial files. This paper provides a novel
approximation analysis for this policy where the cache may have partial file
contents. The approximation approach is validated by simulations. Further, gLRU
outperforms the LRU strategy for a Zipf file popularity distribution and
censored Pareto file size distribution for the file download times. Video
streaming applications can further use the partial cache contents to help the
stall duration significantly, and the numerical results indicate significant
improvements (32\%) in stall duration using the gLRU strategy as compared to
the LRU strategy. Furthermore, the gLRU replacement policy compares favorably
to two other cache replacement policies when simulated on MSR Cambridge Traces
obtained from the SNIA IOTTA repository.

model with string melting, the properties of multiplicity fluctuations of
charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=\rm{~2.76
\,TeV}$ are studied. Normalized factorial moments, $F_{q}$, of spatial
distributions of the particles have been determined in the framework of
intermittency. Those moments are found in some kinematic regions to exhibit
scaling behavior at small bin sizes, but not in most regions. However, in
relating $F_{q}$ to $F_{2}$ scaling behavior is found in nearly all regions.
The corresponding scaling exponents, $\nu$, determined in the low transverse
momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) region $\le$ 1.0 GeV/c are observed to be independent
of the $p_{\rm{T}}$ bin position and width. The value of $\nu$ is found to be
larger than 1.304, which is the value that characterizes the Ginzburg-Landau
type second order phase transition. Thus there is no known signature for phase
transition in the AMPT model. This study demonstrates that, for the system
under investigation, the method of analysis is effective in extracting features
that are relevant to the question of whether the dynamical processes leading
phase transition are there or not.

infrared (IR) wavelengths. Non-thermal radio emission has been detected so far
only from the bowshock of BD+43{\deg}3654, whereas the detection of non-thermal
radiation from these bowshocks at high energies remains elusive. Aims: We aim
at characterising in detail the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission from
stellar bowshocks accounting for the structure of the region of interaction
between the stellar wind and its environment. Methods: We develop a
broadband-radiative, multi-zone model for stellar bowshocks that takes into
account the spatial structure of the emitting region and the observational
constraints. The model predicts the evolution and the emission of the
relativistic particles accelerated and streaming together with the shocked
flow. Results: We present broadband non-thermal spectral energy distributions
for different scenarios, synthetic radio-cm synchrotron maps that reproduce the
morphology of BD+43{\deg}3654, and updated predictions in X-ray and gamma-ray
energy ranges. We also compare the results of the multi-zone model applied in
this work with those of a refined one-zone model. Conclusions: A multi-zone
model provides better constraints than a one-zone model on the relevant
parameters, namely the magnetic field intensity and the amount of energy
deposited in non-thermal particles. However, one-zone models can be improved by
carefully characterising the intensity of the IR dust photon field and the
escape rate of the plasma from the shocked region. Finally, comparing observed
radio maps with those obtained from a multi-zone model enables constraints to
be obtained on the direction of stellar motion with respect to the observer.

multiple minor mergers, which are responsible for the complex dynamics of

gap of point source analysis between the COMPTEL catalog and the Fermi-LAT

Galactic, and 17 are unclassified in the 3FGL. The ratio of the number of flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) to BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) in 1FLE is 3 to 1, which
can be compared with an approximately 1 to 1 ratio for the 3FGL or a 1 to 6
ratio for 3FHL. The higher ratio of the FSRQs in the 1FLE is expected due to
generally softer spectra of FSRQs relative to BL Lacs. Most BL Lacs in 1FLE are
of low-synchrotron peaked blazar type (18 out of 31), which have softer spectra
and higher redshifts than BL Lacs on average. Correspondingly, we find that the
average redshift of the BL Lacs in 1FLE is higher than in 3FGL or 3FHL. There
are 11 sources that do not have associations in the 3FGL. Most of the
unassociated sources either come from regions of bright diffuse emission or

confusion. The remaining unassociated sources have significance less than 4

the relevant documents may not contain the same (symbolic) terms of the query.
Recently, neural representations have shown great success in capturing semantic
relatedness, leading to new possibilities to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch
problem in IR. However, most existing efforts in this direction have been
devoted to the re-ranking stage. That is to leverage neural representations to
help re-rank a set of candidate documents, which are typically obtained from an
initial retrieval stage based on some symbolic index and search scheme (e.g.,
BM25 over the inverted index). This naturally raises a question: if the
relevant documents have not been found in the initial retrieval stage due to
vocabulary mismatch, there would be no chance to re-rank them to the top
positions later. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem how to employ
neural representations to improve the recall of relevant documents in the
initial retrieval stage. Specifically, to meet the efficiency requirement of
the initial stage, we introduce a neural index for the neural representations
of documents, and propose two hybrid search schemes based on both neural and
symbolic indices, namely the parallel search scheme and the sequential search
scheme. Our experiments show that both hybrid index and search schemes can
improve the recall of the initial retrieval stage with small overhead.

framework for the design of such schemes that satisfy a semi-discrete entropy
inequality for a given convex entropy function at any approximation order. The
framework is closely related to the one introduced for conservation laws by
Chen and Shu (J. Comput. Phys., 345 (2017), pp.~427--461) and relies on the
modification of the integral over discretization elements where we replace the
physical fluxes by entropy conservative numerical fluxes from Castro et al.

numerical fluxes are used at element interfaces. Time discretization is
performed with strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta schemes. We use this
framework for the discretization of two systems in one space-dimension: a
$2\times2$ system with a nonconservative product associated to a
linearly-degenerate field for which the DGSEM fails to capture the physically
relevant solution, and the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model. For the latter, we
derive conditions on the numerical parameters of the discrete scheme to further
keep positivity of the partial densities and a maximum principle on the void

broad wings. The terminal velocity of the wind, as measured in the blue-shifted
absorption (P-Cygni) components, is in the range of ~ 900-1600 km/s, while the
broad emission line wings (so-called nebular phases) imply outflow velocities

some of the most classically counter-intuitive quantum phenomena. As such, the
ability to certify the presence of genuinely non-classical joint measurements
in a device-independent fashion is vital. However, previous work has either
been non-device-independent, or has relied on post-selection---the ability to
discard all runs of an experiment in which a specific event did not occur. In
the case of entanglement, the post-selection approach applies an entangled
measurement to independent states and post-selects the outcome, inducing
non-classical correlations between the states that can be device-independently
certified using a Bell inequality. That is, it certifies measurement
non-classicality not by what it is, but by what it does. This paper remedies
this discrepancy by providing a novel notion of what measurement
non-classicality is, which, in analogy with Bell's theorem, corresponds to
measurement statistics being incompatible with an underlying classical causal
model. It is shown that this provides a more fine-grained notion of
non-classicality than post-selection, as it certifies the presence of
non-classicality that cannot be revealed by examining post-selected outcomes
alone.

from business analytics should utilize deep neural networks and review
potential use cases, necessary requirements, and benefits. (3) We investigate
the added value to operations research in different case studies with real data

1) interact with sophisticated interfaces of web applications; 2) precisely

Ia) into genuine standard candles has been suffering criticism. Indeed, it
assumes a particular cosmological model (namely the flat $\Lambda$CDM) to
calibrate the standardisation corrections parameters, i.e. the dependency of
the supernova peak absolute magnitude on its colour, post-maximum decline rate
and host galaxy mass. As a result, this assumption could make the data
compliant to the assumed cosmology and thus nullify all works previously
conducted on model comparison. In this work, we verify the viability of these
hypotheses by developing a cosmology-independent approach to standardise SNe Ia
data from the recent JLA compilation. Our resulting corrections turn out to be
very close to the $\Lambda$CDM-based corrections. Therefore, even if a
$\Lambda$CDM-based calibration is questionable from a theoretical point of
view, the potential compliance of SNe Ia data does not happen in practice for
the JLA compilation. Previous works of model comparison based on these data do
not have to be called into question. However, as this cosmology-independent
standardisation method has the same degree of complexity than the
model-dependent one, it is worth using it in future works, especially if
smaller samples are considered, such as the superluminous type Ic supernovae.

received an enormous amount of attention. Unfortunately, whilst potentially
very powerful, unsupervised methods for uncovering labels based on topology
alone has been shown to suffer from several difficulties. For example, the
search space for many module extraction approaches, such as the modularity
maximisation algorithm, appears to be extremely glassy, with many high valued
solutions that lack any real similarity to one another. However, in this paper
we argue that this is not a flaw with the modularity maximisation algorithm
but, rather, information that can be used to aid the context specific
classification of functional relationships between vertices. Formally, we
present an approach for generating a high value modularity consensus space for
a network, based on the ensemble space of locally optimal modular partitions.
We then use this approach to uncover latent relationships, given small query
sets. The methods developed in this paper are applied to biological and social
datasets with ground-truth label data, using a small number of examples used as
seed sets to uncover relationships. When tested on both real and synthetic
datasets our method is shown to achieve high levels of classification accuracy
in a context specific manner, with results comparable to random walk with
restart methods.

across the broad range of modern neutrino physics, bringing together physicists
who are active in the analysis of neutrino data with experts in statistics to
explore statistical issues in the field. It is a goal of PhyStat-$\nu$ to help
serve the neutrino physics community by providing a forum within which such
statistical issues can be discussed and disseminated broadly.
  This paper is adapted from a summary document that was initially circulated
amongst the participants soon after the workshop. Another PhyStat-$\nu$
workshop is being held at CERN in January 2019, building on the discussions in
2016.
  Advances in experimental neutrino physics in recent years have led to much
larger datasets and more diversity in the properties of neutrinos that are
being investigated. The discussions here raised several areas where improved
statistical errors and more complicated interpretations of the data require
statistical methods to be revisited, as well as topics where broader
discussions between experimentalists, phenomenologists and theorists will
required, which are summarised here. It is important to record the state of the
field as it stands today, as much is expected to change over the coming years,
including the emergence of more inter-collaborational studies and increasing
sophistication in global parameter fitting and model selection methods. The
document is also intended to serve as a reference for pedagogical material for

to the distributed nature of ledger technology, there is a strong recent trend
towards using ledgers to implement novel decentralized applications for a wide
range of use cases, e.g., in the financial sector and sharing economy. While
there can be several arguments for the use of a ledger, the key question is
whether it can fully replace any single trusted party in the system as
otherwise a (potentially simpler) solution can be built around the trusted
party. In this paper, we introduce an abstract view on ledger use cases and
present two fundamental criteria that must be met for any use case to be
implemented using a ledger-based approach without having to rely on any
particular party in the system. Moreover, we evaluate several ledger use cases
that have recently received considerable attention according to these criteria,
revealing that often participants need to trust each other despite using a
distributed ledger. Consequently, the potential of using a ledger as a
replacement for a trusted party is limited for these use cases.

[arXiv:1711.03528] such dynamics was attributed to the existence of ""quantum
scarred"" eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized
model. Here we present a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the
same model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous
thermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs
ensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum,
we identify non-ergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number
grows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were
identified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to
explain the revivals observed in experiment. Here we find that these
eigenstates, in addition to highly atypical expectation values of local
observables, also exhibit sub-thermal entanglement entropy that scales
logarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class
of quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the
dynamics starting from initial product states. We use forward scattering
approximation to describe the structure and physical properties of
quantum-scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars
to various perturbations. We observe that quantum scars remain robust when the
introduced perturbation is compatible with the forward scattering
approximation. In contrast, the perturbations which most efficiently destroy
quantum scars also lead to the restoration of ""canonical"" thermalization.

such as spatio-temporal modulations of the neural firing threshold, asymmetric
synaptic coupling kernels, and additive inputs. Treating these controls as
perturbations to the neural field system, one obtains an equation of motion for
traveling wave solutions in response to the applied controls. Subsequently, we
pose the inverse question of how to design controls that lead to a propagation

use of a specific excitation of the solution's translational modes which
enables an explicit calculation of a necessary control signal for a given
velocity protocol without evoking shape deformations. Moreover, we derive an
equivalent control method relying on a modulation of the neurons' synaptic

present the implementation and validation of an open source MATLAB package for
efficient numerical simulations of the coupled processes in fractured systems.
We take advantage of the embedded discrete fracture model that efficiently
accounts for discrete fractures. We perform a series of numerical benchmark
experiments to validate the implemented approach against analytical solutions
and established numerical methods. Finally, we use a simplified geomechanical
model and an integrated fracture stability analysis that allows estimating the
potential for shear stimulation, and thus a mechanistic assessment of induced
seismic risk during stimulation. The open source distribution of the source

Furthermore, this charge ordering is a quantum phase transition with respect to
the dimensionless coupling constant $\lambda$ related to the mechanism that
drives the band reconstruction (e. g. electron-phonon coupling), with the
critical value given by $\lambda_c= (1+2/\pi)^{-1}$. Preliminary estimations

shorter than the typical 30 days duration of the previous outbursts. It reached
a 0.3-70 keV unabsorbed peak luminosity of $\sim3\times10^{36}$ erg/s. This is

blackbody component. The former, characterized by an electron temperature of
~20 keV, a photon index of ~1.6-1.7 keV and seed photon temperature of 0.44

latter is more likely originating from the neutron star surface

field dynamics. In particular, when there is an absorbing state, the noise
erases a stable fixed point of the mean field equation from the stationary
distribution, and turns it into a transient peak. We make a quantitative
analysis of this effect for a simple genetic regulatory network with positive
feedback, where the proteins become extinct in the presence of stochastic
noise, contrary to the prediction of the deterministic rate equation that the
protein number converges to a non-zero value. We show that the transient peak
appears near the stable fixed point of the rate equation, and the extinction
time diverges exponentially as the stochastic noise approaches zero. We also
show how the baseline production from the inactive gene ameliorates the effect
of the stochastic noise, and interpret the opposite effects of the noise and
the baseline production in terms of the position shift of the unstable fixed
point. The order of magnitude estimates using biological parameters suggest
that for a real gene regulatory network, the stochastic noise is sufficiently
small so that not only is the extinction time much larger than biologically
relevant time-scales, but also the effect of the baseline production dominates
over that of the stochastic noise, leading to the protection from the
catastrophic rare event of protein extinction.

macroscopic scales, leading to a significant increase of the detection cross
section. We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons
(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided
that the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the
neutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The
radiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted
photons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and
therefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.
The requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space
available for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in
the case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and
charged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the
elementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic
coherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection
cross section. However, for the $\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino
magnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the
detection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of
neutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not
accessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work
for relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally
considered non-relativistic dark matter.

Nowadays, natural minerals continue to inspire the search for novel magnetic

liquids. The recent surge of interest in magnetic frustration and quantum
magnetism was largely encouraged by crystalline structures of natural minerals
realizing pyrochlore, kagome, or triangular arrangements of magnetic ions. As a
result, names like azurite, jarosite, volborthite, and others, which were
barely known beyond the mineralogical community a few decades ago, found their
way into cutting-edge research in solid-state physics. In some cases, the
structures of natural minerals are too complex to be synthesized artificially
in a chemistry lab, especially in single-crystalline form, and there is a
growing number of examples demonstrating the potential of natural specimens for
experimental investigations in the field of quantum magnetism. On many other

unusual magnetic properties. The present review attempts to embrace this
quickly emerging interdisciplinary field that bridges mineralogy with

return at the same time as it minimizes portfolio risk is a classical problem
in Mathematical Finance and is referred to as the dynamic Markowitz problem
(when the risk is measured by variance) or more generally, the dynamic
mean-risk problem. In most of the literature, the mean-risk problem is
scalarized and it is well known that this scalarized problem does not satisfy
the (scalar) Bellman's principle. Thus, the classical dynamic programming
methods are not applicable. For the purpose of this paper we focus on the
discrete time setup, and we will use a time consistent dynamic convex risk
measure to evaluate the risk of a portfolio. We will show that when we do not
scalarize the problem, but leave it in its original form as a vector
optimization problem, the upper images, whose boundary contains the efficient
frontier, recurse backwards in time under very mild assumptions. Thus, the
dynamic mean-risk problem does satisfy a Bellman's principle, but a more
general one, that seems more appropriate for a vector optimization problem: a
set-valued Bellman's principle. We will present conditions under which this
recursion can be exploited directly to compute a solution in the spirit of
dynamic programming. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed method. The
obtained results open the door for a new branch in mathematics: dynamic
multivariate programming.

inside the body and a gateway outside the body has showed its criticality with
recent reports of hackings. The use of asymmetric cryptography is not a
practical solution for IMDs due to the scarce computational and power
resources, symmetric key cryptography is preferred. One of the factors in
security of a symmetric cryptographic system is to use a strong key for
encryption. A solution without using extensive resources in an IMD, is to
extract it from the body physiological signals. To have a strong enough key,
the physiological signal must be a strong source of randomness and InterPulse
Interval (IPI) has been advised to be such that. A strong randomness source
should have five conditions: Universality, Liveness, Robustness Permanence and
Uniqueness. Nevertheless, for current proposed random extraction methods from
IPI these conditions (mainly last three conditions) were not examined. In this
study, firstly, we proposed a methodology to measure the last three conditions.
Then, using a huge dataset of IPI values, we showed that IPI does not have
conditions of Robustness and Permanence. Thus, extraction of a strong uniform
random number from IPI value, mathematically, is impossible. Thirdly, rather
than using the value of IPI, we proposed the trend of IPI as a source for a new
randomness extraction method named as Martingale Randomness Extraction from IPI
(MRE-IPI). MRE-IPI satisfies the Robustness condition completely and Permanence
to some level. We, also, used randomness test suites and showed that MRE-IPI is
able to outperform all recent randomness extraction methods from IPIs and its
quality is half of the AES random number. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work in this area which uses such a comprehensive method and large
dataset to examine the randomness of a physiological signal.

into the structure and properties of materials. Two main obstacles appear for
the cooperation of simulation and experiment: on the one hand, the frequent
lack of a degree of uncertainty associated with calculated data. On the other,
the concomitant underlying feeling that calculation parameters can be tuned
with the explicit aim of matching the experimental results, even at the expense
of the quality of the simulation. Without the definition of an error bar for
estimating the precision of the calculation, direct comparison of calculated
and experimental data can lack physical significance. In this contribution, we
employ the well known delocalization error of DFT and HF to develop a simple
and robust procedure to quickly estimate an error bar for calculated quantities
in the field of solid state chemistry. First, we validate our model on one of
the simplest properties of a solid, the geometry of its unit cell, which can be
determined experimentally with high accuracy. In this case, our computational
window is too large to provide a useful error bar. However, it provides
computational material scientists with a pointer on how much a given system is
affected by the method of choice, i.e. how much it is sensible to parameter
tuning and how much care should be taken in doing it. Then, we move to another
quantity which has a greater experimental uncertainty, namely transition
pressure, and show that our approach can lead to error bars comparable to
experiment. Hence, both experiment and theory can be compared on an even basis
taking into account the uncertainty introduced by the scientist, both in the
measuring conditions and the tuning of computational parameters.

wavefront correction systems to reject optical aberrations and create
sufficiently dark holes. Since the most efficient wavefront correction
algorithms (controllers and estimators) are usually model-based, the modeling
accuracy of the system influences the ultimate wavefront correction
performance. Currently, wavefront correction systems are typically approximated
as linear systems using Fourier optics. However, the Fourier optics model is
usually biased due to inaccuracies in the layout measurements, the imperfect
diagnoses of inherent optical aberrations, and a lack of knowledge of the
deformable mirrors (actuator gains and influence functions). Moreover, the
telescope optical system varies over time because of instrument instabilities
and environmental effects. In this paper, we present an
expectation-maximization (E-M) approach for identifying and real-time adapting
the linear telescope model from data. By iterating between the E-step (a Kalman
filter and a Rauch smoother) and the M-step (analytical or gradient-based
optimization), the algorithm is able to recover the system even if the model
depends on the electric fields, which are unmeasurable hidden variables.
Simulations and experiments in Princeton's High Contrast Imaging Lab
demonstrate that this algorithm improves the model accuracy and increases the
efficiency and speed of the wavefront correction.

coefficients $C_{\mathrm{R}}$. Simulation results for $C_{\mathrm{R}}$ were
mostly below or equal to the analytical predictions, but never more than
$3.4\%$ larger. Therefore, the proposed approach can be recommended for
engineering practice. Furthermore, it is shown that implicit relaxation zones
can be considered as a special-case of forcing zones, a family of approaches
which includes among others absorbing layers, damping zones and sponge layers.
The commonalities and differences between these approaches are discussed,

involves the more intricate limit $g$ of $\partial\_t u\_\varepsilon\times

the maximal velocity defined as the square root of the ratio between the

This appears at first sight in contradiction with the criterion. Beyond

always exhibit an energy scale of order or higher than a Kaluza-Klein scale, as
we argue. A corresponding 4d low energy effective theory would then differ from
the usual consistent truncations, and as we explain, would not admit a de
Sitter solution. This would reconcile the existence of these 10d de Sitter
solutions with the 4d criterion. A second, alternative possibility is to have a
refined swampland criterion, that we propose. It forbids to have both the
existence and the stability of a de Sitter solution, while unstable solutions

Despite successes of the model in explaining heat transport mechanisms in
layered materials (e.g., phonon focusing in highly anisotropic materials), the
anisotropic Debye model assumes a phonon dispersion with unrealistic speeds of
sounds especially for the flexural (ZA) phonons and overestimated cutoffs for
all phonon branches. The deficiencies lead to substantially underestimated
phonon irradiation for low-frequency phonons. Here, we develop an anisotropic
model with truncated linear dispersion that resembles the real phonon
dispersion, using speeds of sounds derived from elastic constants and cutoff
frequencies derived from Brillouin zone boundaries. We also employ a piecewise

irradiation over a wide temperature range, verifying the accuracy of our
model.We compare calculations of our and the Dames models to measurements of
thermal conductivity of graphite and thermal conductance of metal/graphite

theory of UKFs for Riemannian systems: for instance, the literature has not yet
i) developed Riemannian extensions of some fundamental concepts of the UKF

transitions as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, and can exhibit hard
phases in which optimal inference is information-theoretically possible but
computationally challenging. In this paper we refine this description by
emphasizing the existence of more generic phase diagrams with a hybrid-hard
phase in which it is computationally easy to reach a non-trivial inference
accuracy, but computationally hard to match the information theoretically
optimal one. We support this discussion by quantitative expansions of the
functional cavity equations that describe inference problems on sparse graphs.
These expansions shed light on the existence of hybrid-hard phases, for a large
class of planted constraint satisfaction problems, and on the question of the
tightness of the Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound for the associated tree
reconstruction problem. Our results show that the instability of the trivial
fixed point is not a generic evidence for the Bayes-optimality of the message
passing algorithms. We clarify in particular the status of the symmetric SBM
with 4 communities and of the tree reconstruction of the associated Potts
model: in the assortative (ferromagnetic) case the KS bound is always tight,
whereas in the disassortative (antiferromagnetic) case we exhibit an explicit
criterion involving the degree distribution that separates a large degree
regime where the KS bound is tight and a low degree regime where it is not. We
also investigate the SBM with 2 communities of different sizes, a.k.a. the
asymmetric Ising model, and describe quantitatively its computational gap as a
function of its asymmetry, and a version of the SBM with 2 groups of
communities. We complement this study with numerical simulations of the Belief

The filler particles are immobilized in the matrix if the MAE sample is cooled
below 220 K, where the anisotropy can be read out. The cooling of the sample is
considered as an alternative methodological approach to the experimental
investigation of the magnetized state of MAEs. The appearance of magnetic
anisotropy in MAE is associated with restructuring of the filler during
magnetization, which leads to an additional effective field felt by the
magnetization. It is found that the magnitude of the effective magnetic
anisotropy constant of the MAE is approximately two times larger than its
effective shear modulus in the absence of magnetic field. It is proposed that
the experimentally observed large (about 40) ratio of the magnetic anisotropy
constant of the filler to the shear modulus of the matrix deserves attention

lead to additional rigidity of the elastic subsystem increasing the shear

pumping with circularly polarized light. The spectral laser width is tailored
such that different groups of quantum dots are coherently pumped. Surprisingly,
the dephasing time $T^*$ of the electron spin polarization depends only weakly
on the laser spectral width. These findings can be consistently explained by a
cluster theory of coupled quantum dots with a long range electronic spin-spin
interaction. We present a numerical simulation of the spin dynamics based on
the central spin model that includes a quantum mechanical description of the
laser pulses as well as a time-independent Heisenberg interaction between each

stemming from the Overhauser field, the distribution of the electron
$g$-factors and the electronic spin-spin interaction as well as the spectral
width of the laser pulse. This analysis reveals the counterbalancing effect of
the total dephasing time when increasing the spectral laser width. On one hand,
the deviations of the electron $g$-factors increase. On the other hand, an
increasing number of coherently pumped electron spins synchronize due to the
spin-spin interaction. We find an excellent agreement between the experimental

climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Machine learning (ML) can be
used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output,
but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully
coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for
simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here, we focus on these issues
using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on
output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in
simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as
the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures
conservation of energy and non-negativity of surface precipitation. The GCM
with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures
important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need
for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and
a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on
the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from
both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only
on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate
provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition
to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML
parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction
between convection and the large-scale environment.

between the two networks. These challenges are addressed in this paper by
presenting a fully autonomous and distributed underlay DSA scheme where each CR
operates based on predicting its transmission effect on the PN. The scheme is
based on a cognitive engine with an artificial neural network that predicts,
without exchanging information between the networks, the adaptive modulation
and coding configuration for the primary link nearest to a transmitting CR. By
managing the effect of the SN on the PN, the presented technique maintains the
relative average throughput change in the PN within a prescribed maximum value,
while also finding transmit settings for the CRs that result in throughput as
large as allowed by the PN interference limit. Simulation results show that the
ability of the cognitive engine in estimating the effect of a CR transmission
on the full adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) mode leads to a much more fine
underlay transmit power control. This ability also provides higher transmission
opportunities for the CRs, compared to a scheme that can only estimate the
modulation scheme used at the PN link.

of species. It consists of two levels of heteroclinic cycles. On the lower
level, the heteroclinic cycle connects three saddles, each representing the
survival of a single species; on the higher level, the cycle connects three
such heteroclinic cycles, in which nine species are involved. We show how to
tune the predation rates in order to generate the long time scales on the
higher level from the shorter time scales on the lower level. Moreover, when we
tune a single bifurcation parameter, first the motion along the lower and next
along the higher-level heteroclinic cycles are replaced by a heteroclinic cycle
between 3-species coexistence-fixed points and by a 9-species coexistence-fixed
point, respectively. We also observe a similar impact of additive noise. Beyond
its usual role of preventing the slowing-down of heteroclinic trajectories at
small noise level, its increasing strength can replace the lower-level
heteroclinic cycle by 3-species coexistence fixed-points, connected by an
effective limit cycle, and for even stronger noise the trajectories converge to
the 9-species coexistence-fixed point. The model has applications to systems in
which slow oscillations modulate fast oscillations with sudden transitions

a Gaussian dilation using an ancilla with the same number of modes as the

clear demarcation of the role of Gaussian and non-Gaussian resources in the

images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) for coronal loop diagnostics. These images are combined with
the co-temporal line-of-sight magnetic field maps from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO to investigate the connection between coronal
loops and their magnetic roots in the photosphere. The core of these ARs
exhibit loop brightening in multiple EUV channels of AIA, particularly in its
9.4 nm filter. The HMI magnetic field maps reveal the presence of a complex
mixed polarity magnetic field distribution at the base of these loops. We
detect the cancellation of photospheric magnetic flux at these locations at a
rate of about $10^{15}$ Mx s$^{-1}$. The associated compact coronal
brightenings directly above the cancelling magnetic features are indicative of
plasma heating due to chromospheric magnetic reconnection. We suggest that the
complex magnetic topology and the evolution of magnetic field, such as flux
cancellation in the photosphere and the resulting chromospheric reconnection,
can play an important role in energizing active region coronal loops driven by

requirements on anonymization and obfuscation in the case that data traces are

revealing which user data traces are dependent. Next, we demonstrate that the
adversary can use this association graph to break user privacy with
significantly shorter traces than in the case of independent users, and that
obfuscating data traces independently across users is often insufficient to
remedy such leakage. Finally, we discuss how users can improve privacy by
employing joint obfuscation that removes or reduces the data dependency.

reaches the maximum, and then it is decreasing and eventually vanishing at the
limit to the radius where the proper acceleration is infinite. In fact, the
temperature is proportional to the proper acceleration quadratically near the
origin of the circular motion as compared to the usual Unruh effect depending
on the linear proper acceleration. On the other hand, in the drifted Rindler
motion, the observer moves with a relative velocity in the direction transverse
to the acceleration. If the detector is moving slowly in the transverse
direction with a finite proper acceleration, then the temperature behaves like
the usual Unruh temperature, while it vanishes for the speed of light in the
transverse direction according to the infinite proper acceleration.
Consequently, it turns out that the temperatures behave nonlinearly with
respect to the proper acceleration and the infinite proper acceleration would
not always permit the divergent temperature.

two main control schemes have been proposed, usually referred to as
'primal-dual' and 'distributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI)'
respectively. However, each has its limitations, with the former requiring
knowledge of uncontrollable demand, which can be difficult to obtain in real
time, and with the existing literature on the latter being based on static
models for generation and demand. We propose a novel control scheme that
overcomes these issues by making use of generation measurements in the control
policy. In particular, our analysis allows distributed stability and optimality
guarantees to be deduced with practical measurement requirements and permits a
broad range of linear generation dynamics, that can be of higher order, to be
incorporated in the power network. We show how the controller parameters can be
selected in a computationally efficient way by solving appropriate linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed
analysis applies to several examples of turbine governor models. The
practicality of our analysis is demonstrated with simulations on the Northeast

context of this development, combined photovoltaic and heat-power systems were
analyzed, which provide not only electricity but also heat throughout one
entire year. Flexibilities are provided in form of thermal and electrical
storage systems leading to many possible setting options requiring an
elaborated control management. In this paper, a new optimized control algorithm
is proposed that in contrast to standard strategies can operate optimal even
under incorrect weather and load forecasts. A predictive controller based on a
mixed integer optimization problem and an additional so called secondary,
rule-based controller is combined. The controller is based on several input
data. Depending on the choice of these data the PV-CHP hybrid system can be
used for different control strategies, like maximum self-consumption, minimum
CO2 emission or minimum operational costs. The main focus in this paper is to
study if the flexibility potentials of the combined thermal and electrical
storage systems can ensure a market oriented or a grid-friendly behavior. This
is studied in five control options. As a result we found that the control
algorithm is stable and able to adapt to the different conditions. In
conclusion, it was discovered that the storage systems play a crucial role in
terms of forecast differences and parameter changes. Storage systems are as

  Data Selection",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Lithography simulation is one of the key steps in physical verification,
enabled by the substantial optical and resist models. A resist model bridges
the aerial image simulation to printed patterns. While the effectiveness of
learning-based solutions for resist modeling has been demonstrated, they are
considerably data-demanding. Meanwhile, a set of manufactured data for a
specific lithography configuration is only valid for the training of one single
model, indicating low data efficiency. Due to the complexity of the
manufacturing process, obtaining enough data for acceptable accuracy becomes
very expensive in terms of both time and cost, especially during the evolution
of technology generations when the design space is intensively explored. In
this work, we propose a new resist modeling framework for contact layers,
utilizing existing data from old technology nodes and active selection of data
in a target technology node, to reduce the amount of data required from the
target lithography configuration. Our framework based on transfer learning and
active learning techniques is effective within a competitive range of accuracy,
i.e., 3-10X reduction on the amount of training data with comparable accuracy
to the state-of-the-art learning approach.

dynamics and non-commutativity of space-time by using Dirac's constraint
analysis. In this study, we re-parameterise the time $t=t(\tau)$ along with
$x=x(\tau)$ and treat both as configuration space variables. Here, $\tau$ is a
monotonic increasing parameter and the system evolves with this parameter.
After constraint analysis, we find the deformed Dirac brackets similar to the
$\kappa$-deformed space-time and also, get the deformed Hamilton's equations of
motion. Moreover, we study the effect of non-commutativity on the generators of
Galilean group and Poincare group and find undeformed form of the algebra.
Also, we work on the extended space analysis in the Lagrangian formalism. We
find the primary as well as the secondary constraints. Strikingly on
calculating the Dirac brackets among the phase space variables, we obtain the
classical version of $\kappa$-Minkowski algebra.

  control of a carrier system","14 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.NE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper intends to cover three main topics. First, a fuzzy-PID controller
is designed to control the thrust vector of a launch vehicle, accommodating a
CanSat. Then, the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the controller
performance. Finally, through adjusting the algorithm parameters, their impact
on the optimization process is examined. In this regard, the motion vector
control is programmed based on the governing dynamic equations of motion for
payload delivery in the desired altitude and flight-path angle. This utilizes
one single input and one preferential fuzzy inference engine, where the latter
acts to avoid the system instability in large angles for the thrust vector. The
optimization objective functions include the deviations of the thrust vector
and the system from the equilibrium state, which must be met simultaneously.
Sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the genetic algorithm involves
examining nine different cases and discussing their impact on the optimization
results.

the development of machine learning methods that can get high dimensional data

dribble the ball to the goal. We use B-Human robot software to collect
demonstration data and a deep convolutional network to represent the policies.
We use top and bottom camera images of the robot as input and speed commands as
outputs. The CNN policy learns the mapping between the series of images and
speed commands. In 3D realistic robotics simulator experiments, we show that
the robot is able to learn to search the ball and dribble the ball, but it
struggles to align to the goal. The best-proposed policy model learns to score
4 goals out of 20 test episodes.

This measure displays an increase just before swallowing.
