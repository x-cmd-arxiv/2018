model's decision to make more informed predictions. It does so by making sure
the model has ""the right reasons"" for a prediction, defined as reasons that are
coherent with those used to make similar correct decisions at training time.
The reason/evidence upon which a deep convolutional neural network makes a
prediction is defined to be the spatial grounding, in the pixel space, for a
specific class conditional probability in the model output. Guided Zoom
examines how reasonable such evidence is for each of the top-k predicted
classes, rather than solely trusting the top-1 prediction. We show that Guided
Zoom improves the classification accuracy of a deep convolutional neural
network model and obtains state-of-the-art results on three fine-grained
classification benchmark datasets.

  Processing in Electronic Healthcare Records",,,,,"cs.CL cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) represent a rich resource for
conducting observational studies, supporting clinical trials, and more.
However, much of the relevant information is stored in an unstructured format
that makes it difficult to use. Natural language processing approaches that
attempt to automatically classify the data depend on vectorization algorithms
that impose structure on the text, but these algorithms were not designed for
the unique characteristics of EHR. Here, we propose a new algorithm for
structuring so-called free-text that may help researchers make better use of
EHR. We call this method Relevant Word Order Vectorization (RWOV).
  Materials and Methods: As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to classify the
hormone receptor status of breast cancer patients treated at the University of
Kansas Medical Center during a recent year, from the unstructured text of
pathology reports. Our approach attempts to account for the semi-structured way
that healthcare providers often enter information. We compared this approach to
the ngrams and word2vec methods.
  Results: Our approach resulted in the most consistently high accuracy, as
measured by F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC).
  Discussion: Our results suggest that methods of structuring free text that
take into account its context may show better performance, and that our
approach is promising.
  Conclusion: By using a method that accounts for the fact that healthcare
providers tend to use certain key words repetitively and that the order of
these key words is important, we showed improved performance over methods that
do not.

students have preferences for bundles of course seats or course schedules over
the week, which need to be considered. The problem is a challenging distributed
scheduling task requiring decision support. First-Come First-Served (FCFS) is
simple and the most widely used assignment rule in practice, but it leads to
inefficient outcomes and envy in the allocation. Recent theoretical results
suggest alternatives with attractive economic and computational properties.
Bundled Probabilistic Serial (BPS) is a randomized mechanism satisfying ordinal
efficiency, envy-freeness, and weak strategy-proofness. This mechanism also
runs in polynomial time, which is important for the large problem instances in
the field. We report empirical results from a first implementation of BPS at
the Technical University of Munich, which allows us to provide important
empirical metrics such as the size of the resulting matching, the average rank,
the profile, and the popularity of the assignments. These metrics were central
for the adoption of BPS. In particular, we compare these metrics to Random
Serial Dictatorship with bundle bids (BRSD). The BRSD mechanism is used to
simulate the wide-spread First-Come First-Served (FCFS) mechanism and it allows
us to compare FCFS (BRSD) and BPS. While theoretically appealing, preference
elicitation is a major challenge when considering preferences over
exponentially many packages. We introduce tools to elicit preferences which
reduce the number of parameters a student needs to a manageable set. The
approach together with BPS yields a computationally effective tool to solve
course assignment problems with thousands of students, and possibly provides an
approach for other distributed scheduling tasks in organizations.

minimum is formed. We consider viscosity-matched reactants $A$ and $B$
generating a product $C$ having different viscosity than the reactants.
Depending on the effect of $C$ on the viscosity relative to the reactants,
different viscous fingering (VF) patterns are captured which are in good
qualitative agreement with the existing radial experiments. We have found that
for a given chemical reaction rate, an unfavourable viscosity contrast is not
always sufficient to trigger the instability. For every fixed $Pe$, these
effects of chemical reaction on VF are summarized in the $Da-R_c$ parameter
space that exhibits a stable region separating two unstable regions

determine $Da$-dependent critical log-mobility ratios $R_c^+$ and $R_c^-$ such

at redshift z = 0.231. Image analysis of a 19.6 ks Chandra archival observation
reveals a cluster-wide spiral of enhanced surface brightness in the
intracluster medium (ICM). While such spirals are understood to form in
clusters with sloshing strong cool cores (SCCs), the gas comprising the
spiral's apex is of intermediate entropy ($\sim$ 110 keV cm$^{2}$) and cooling
time ($\sim$ 6.8 Gyr), indicating core disruption is occurring throughout the
spiral formation process. Two subclusters dominated by the second- and
third-ranked galaxies in the system lie along a line parallel to the elongation
axis of the primary cluster's ICM. Both subsystems appear to have fallen in
along a previously discovered intercluster filament and are each considered
candidates as the perturber responsible for initiating disruptive core
sloshing. Dynamical analysis indicates infall is occurring with a relative
radial velocity of $\sim$ 1800 km s$^{-1}$. The brightest cluster galaxy of
Abell 1763 possesses a high line-of-sight peculiar velocity (v$_{pec}$ $\sim$
650 km s$^{-1}$) and hosts a powerful (P$_{1.4}$ $\sim$ 10$^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$)
bent double-lobed radio source, likely shaped by the relative bulk ICM flow
induced in the merger. The cluster merger model of SCC destruction invokes low
impact parameter infall as the condition required for core transformation. In
contrast to this, the high angular momentum event occurring in Abell 1763
suggests that off-axis mergers play a greater role in establishing the non-cool
core cluster population than previously assumed.

lot of attention recently because of their promising performance. repeat
consumption is a common phenomenon in many recommendation scenarios (e.g.,
e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), where the same item is

repeat consumption with neural networks. An effective neural approach is needed
to decide when to perform repeat recommendation. In this paper, we incorporate
a repeat-explore mechanism into neural networks and propose a new model, called
RepeatNet, with an encoder-decoder structure. RepeatNet integrates a regular
neural recommendation approach in the decoder with a new repeat recommendation
mechanism that can choose items from a user's history and recommends them at
the right time. We report on extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets.
RepeatNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on all three datasets in terms
of MRR and Recall. Furthermore, as the dataset size and the repeat ratio
increase, the improvements of RepeatNet over the baselines also increase, which
demonstrates its advantage in handling repeat recommendation scenarios.

prominent examples are given by leptogenesis and electroweak baryogenesis,

production of the asymmetries. We first use intuitive arguments based on
classical fluid equations in combination with quantum-field-theoretical effects
of CP-violation. As for a more thorough approach that is well-suited for
systematic improvements, we obtain the real-time evolution of the system of

practicable scheme to set up phenomenological fluid equations based on first
principles of quantum field theory. Necessary for baryogenesis are both, CP
even as well as odd phases in the amplitudes. A possibility of generating the
even phases is the coherent superposition of quantum states, i.e. mixing. These
coherence effects are essential in resonant leptogenesis as well as in some

certified by traditional authoritative entities. This requires the development
of appropriate methodologies that can evaluate in a systematic way these

individuals, who nowadays tend to increasingly form their opinions based on
what they read online and on social media, to come into contact with
information that is actually useful and verified. Wikipedia is nowadays one of
the biggest online resources on which users rely as a source of information.
The amount of collaboratively generated content that is sent to the online

(and, consequently, misinformation) if not properly monitored and revised. For
this reason, in this paper, the problem of automatically assessing the quality
of Wikipedia articles is considered. In particular, the focus is on the
analysis of hand-crafted features that can be employed by supervised machine
learning techniques to perform the classification of Wikipedia articles on
qualitative bases. With respect to prior literature, a wider set of
characteristics connected to Wikipedia articles are taken into account and

sidereal time (LST) using night-time data and a two-parameter fitting equation.
We find $-2.59<\beta<-2.54 \pm 0.011$ between 0 and 12 h LST, ignoring
ionospheric effects. When the Galactic Centre is in the sky, the spectral index
flattens, reaching $\beta = -2.46 \pm 0.011$ at 18.2 h. The measurements are
stable throughout the observations with night-to-night reproducibility of
$\sigma_{\beta}<0.004$ except for the LST range of 7 to 12 h. We compare our
measurements with predictions from various global sky models and find that the
closest match is with the spectral index derived from the Guzm{\'a}n and Haslam
sky maps, similar to the results found with the EDGES high-band instrument for
90-190 MHz. Three-parameter fitting was also evaluated with the result that the
spectral index becomes more negative by $\sim$0.02 and has a maximum total
uncertainty of 0.016. We also find that the third parameter, the spectral index
curvature, $\gamma$, is constrained to $-0.11<\gamma<-0.04$. Correcting for
expected levels of night-time ionospheric absorption causes $\beta$ to become
more negative by $0.008$ - $0.016$ depending on LST.

approximate, for example in the presence of localized subsystems where the
exact potential is known to exhibit pathological features such as spatial
steps. By modeling two electrons, each localized in a distinct potential well,
we illustrate that the step feature has no counterpart in MBPTs (including
Hartree-Fock and GW) or hybrid methods involving Fock exchange because the
spatial non-locality of the self-energy renders such pathological behavior
unnecessary. We present a quantitative illustration of the orbital-dependent
nature of the non-local potential, and a numerical demonstration of Kohn's

to answer multi-round questions about an image. It typically needs to address
two major problems: (1) How to answer visually-grounded questions, which is the
core challenge in visual question answering (VQA); (2) How to infer the
co-reference between questions and the dialog history. An example of visual
co-reference is: pronouns (\eg, ``they'') in the question (\eg, ``Are they on
or off?'') are linked with nouns (\eg, ``lamps'') appearing in the dialog
history (\eg, ``How many lamps are there?'') and the object grounded in the
image. In this work, to resolve the visual co-reference for visual dialog, we
propose a novel attention mechanism called Recursive Visual Attention (RvA).
Specifically, our dialog agent browses the dialog history until the agent has
sufficient confidence in the visual co-reference resolution, and refines the
visual attention recursively. The quantitative and qualitative experimental
results on the large-scale VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that the
proposed RvA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but also
achieves reasonable recursion and interpretable attention maps without
additional annotations. The code is available at

compare our results with those obtained previously by different authors. We
verify that for healthy mimetic scalar-tensor theories the condition for the

value of the mimetic field energy density $\lambda$. We show that for mimetic
dark matter possessing a shift symmetry the mimetic energy density remains
positive in time, provided appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on its
initial value, while in models without shift symmetry the positive energy
density can be maintained by simply replacing $\lambda\to e^{\lambda}$. The
same result also applies to mimetic $f(R)$ gravity, which is healthy if the
usual stability conditions of the standard $f(R)$ gravity are assumed and
$\lambda>0$. In contrast, if we add mimetic matter to an unhealthy seed action,
the resulting mimetic gravity theory remains, in general, unstable. As an
example, we consider a scalar-tensor theory with the higher-derivative term
$(\Box \varphi)^2$, which contains an Ostrogradski ghost. We also revisit
results regarding stability issues of linear perturbations around the FLRW
background of the mimetic dark matter in the presence of ordinary scalar
matter. We find that the presence of conventional matter does not revive
dynamical ghost modes (at least in the UV limit). The modes, whose Hamiltonian
is not positive definite, are non-propagating (have zero sound speed) and are
associated with the mimetic matter itself. They are already present in the case
in which the ordinary scalar fluid is absent, causing a growth of dust
overdensity.

mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking. Due to the large cancellation
in the standard model (SM) between the box and Higgs-mediated triangle
diagrams, the $gg\to WW(ZZ)$ process in the SM is dominated by the $V_T V_T$
transverse-mode at the high mass tail. The cancellation does not necessarily
hold, when there is a sufficiently large new physics contribution resulting in
$V_LV_L$ longitudinal mode, which is commonly the case when the Higgs sector is
modified. Thus the $V_LV_L$ final states in the high mass tail can be utilized
as a sensitive probe for such models. In the paper we focus on a study of the
$gg \to ZZ$ process in the fully leptonic decay modes, proposing to utilize the
polarization modes of the off-shell Higgs to probe new physics, whose
contribution mainly shows in the longitudinal mode. As examples, we analyze
three different Higgs sector new physics cases (Higgs portal with a light

about the value of $\alpha_{SJ}$(0), the intercept of String Junction Regge

as 0.5 < $\alpha_{SJ}$(0) < 0.9. Here, SJ behaviors are accumulated in the
model based on topological expansion in order to build a neutral object with
zero baryon charge. By the way, QCD mass falling under the event horizon of
Black Hole (BH) should be symmetric, or in other words, have no charge
information. The baryon junctions are easily combinable with antibaryon ones in
hexagons. Topologically, hexagon net can coherently cover only the torus
surface. The net on the torus has discrete number of baryon/antibaryon
junctions. This is only parameter that marks the mass/energy level of this

such pomeron loops are to be produced approximately in 1.2 percent of inelastic

such dense ""doughnut"" near the event horizon of Super Massive Black Hole

challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. The canon of solar
variability, the solar fiducial clock, lies almost exclusively with the 400
years of human telescopic observations that demonstrates the waxing and waning
number of sunspots, over an 11(ish) year period. Recent research has
demonstrated the critical importance of the underlying 22-year magnetic
polarity cycle in establishing the shorter sunspot cycle. Integral to the
manifestation of the latter is the spatio-temporal overlapping and migration of
oppositely polarized magnetic bands. The points when these bands emerge at high
solar latitudes and cancel at the equator are separated by almost 20 years.

should a major oceanic swing follow, our challenge becomes: when does
correlation become causation and how does the process work?

out of their computational subspace, they can be insensitive to certain noise

interaction while maintaining favorable features of the underlying physical

computational and leakage errors, we show that unitary operations have an
average total error of 0.35%, with 0.17% of that coming from leakage driven by
interactions with substrate nuclear spins. This demonstration utilizes only the
voltage-controlled exchange interaction for qubit manipulation and highlights
the operational benefits of encoded subsystems, heralding the realization of

techniques based on finite-element computations to determine the frequency

private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt

these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We

in sensing of weak magnetic fields, such as those created by biological
systems. Detecting such feeble signals requires near-surface NV centers, to
reduce the distance between NVs and sources. Moreover, dense ensembles of NVs
are highly desirable to reduce measurement time. However, robust charge state
switching is often observed in these systems, resulting in a complex interplay
between charge and spin dynamics that can reduce the attainable level of spin
polarization, and consequently, sensitivity. Understanding the mechanisms
behind charge state switching is, therefore, crucial to developing NV based
sensors. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to selectively measure charge
dynamics in an ensemble of NVs by quenching the spin polarization using an
off-axis magnetic field. Utilizing this technique, we show that, in
nanodiamonds, charge state instability increases with increasing NV density. In
the case of bulk single crystal diamond, we show that NV centers located near
the surface are more stable in the neutral (NV$^{0}$) charge state, while the
negatively charged (NV$^{-}$) form is more stable in bulk.

stationary during short intervals (approximately 20 to 30 ms). This assumption

This work investigates the application of adaptive signal processing to the
problem of estimating the formant frequencies of speech. Two algorithms were
implemented and tested. The first one is the conventional Least-Mean-Square
(LMS) algorithm, and the second is the conventional Recursive Least-Squares
(RLS) algorithm. The formant frequencies are the resonant frequencies of the
vocal tract. The speech is the result of the convolution between the excitation
and the vocal tract impulse response [Rabiner, 78], thus a kind of
""deconvolution"" is required to recover the formants. This is not an easy
problem because one does not have the excitation signal available. There are
several algorithms for formant estimation [Rabiner, 78], [Snell, 93], [Laprie,

materials, atomistic simulations are often computationally unfeasible.
Coarse-graining methods allow simulating larger systems, by reducing the
dimensionality of the simulation, and propagating longer timesteps, by
averaging out fast motions. Coarse-graining involves two coupled learning
problems; defining the mapping from an all-atom to a reduced representation,
and the parametrization of a Hamiltonian over coarse-grained coordinates.
Multiple statistical mechanics approaches have addressed the latter, but the
former is generally a hand-tuned process based on chemical intuition. Here we
present Autograin, an optimization framework based on auto-encoders to learn
both tasks simultaneously. Autograin is trained to learn the optimal mapping
between all-atom and reduced representation, using the reconstruction loss to
facilitate the learning of coarse-grained variables. In addition, a
force-matching method is applied to variationally determine the coarse-grained
potential energy function. This procedure is tested on a number of model
systems including single-molecule and bulk-phase periodic simulations.

applications. It partitions a data set into a hierarchical collection of
clusters, and can provide a global view of (cluster) structure behind data
across different granularity levels. A hierarchical clustering (HC) of a data
set can be naturally represented by a tree, called a HC-tree, where leaves
correspond to input data and subtrees rooted at internal nodes correspond to
clusters. Many hierarchical clustering algorithms used in practice are
developed in a procedure manner. Dasgupta proposed to study the hierarchical
clustering problem from an optimization point of view, and introduced an
intuitive cost function for similarity-based hierarchical clustering with nice
properties as well as natural approximation algorithms.
  We observe that while Dasgupta's cost function is effective at
differentiating a good HC-tree from a bad one for a fixed graph, the value of
this cost function does not reflect how well an input similarity graph is
consistent to a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we present a new cost
function, which is developed based on Dasgupta's cost function, to address this
issue. The optimal tree under the new cost function remains the same as the one
under Dasgupta's cost function. However, the value of our cost function is more
meaningful. The new way of formulating the cost function also leads to a
polynomial time algorithm to compute the optimal cluster tree when the input
graph has a perfect HC-structure, or an approximation algorithm when the input
graph 'almost' has a perfect HC-structure. Finally, we provide further
understanding of the new cost function by studying its behavior for random
graphs sampled from an edge probability matrix.

to generate natural images. The VON not only generates images that are more
realistic than state-of-the-art 2D image synthesis methods, but also enables
many 3D operations such as changing the viewpoint of a generated image, editing
of shape and texture, linear interpolation in texture and shape space, and
transferring appearance across different objects and viewpoints.

capturing the translation and rotation-invariant information in cosmological
density fields. PT produces higher-order corrections by integration over linear
statistics of the density fields weighted by kernels resulting from recursive
solution of the fluid equations. These integrals quickly become
high-dimensional and naively require increasing computational resources the
higher the order of the corrections. Here we show how to decouple the
integrands that often produce this issue, enabling PT corrections to be
computed as a sum of products of independent 1-D integrals. Our approach is
related to a commonly used method for calculating multi-loop Feynman integrals
in Quantum Field Theory, the Gegenbauer Polynomial $x$-Space Technique (GPxT).
We explicitly reduce the three terms entering the 2-loop power spectrum,
formally requiring 9-D integrations, to sums over successive 1-D radial
integrals. These 1-D integrals can further be performed as convolutions,
rendering the scaling of this method $N_{\rm g} \log N_{\rm g}$ with $N_{\rm
g}$ the number of grid points used for each Fast Fourier Transform. This method
should be highly enabling for upcoming large-scale structure redshift surveys
where model predictions at an enormous number of cosmological parameter
combinations will be required by Monte Carlo Markov Chain searches for the

assuming $\sim1\,\text{deg}^{-2}$ detected sources, in conjunction with a
spectroscopic follow-up (e.g. by Euclid, DESI, or ATHENA). Thanks to the
statistical power of standard sirens as a geometry probe -- lifting key
degeneracies in the gravitational wave weak lensing -- and no external priors
assumed, the constraints on dark matter and its clustering, namely $\Omega_m$

radiation travels until it reaches a given galaxy. This mean free path can be
very large, of order $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. Consequently, higher-derivative

and dark matter components and are evolved with the GADGET based regularized
tree code KETJU. We show that observed key properties of the nuclear stellar
populations of massive ETGs, namely flat stellar density distributions (cores),
tangentially biased velocity distributions and kinematically decoupled
(counter-)rotation can naturally result from a single process $-$ the scouring
by SMBHs. Major mergers with mass ratios of $q>1/3$ produce flat, tangentially
biased cores with kinematically distinct components. These features originate
from spin reversals during the decay of the SMBH orbits caused by gravitational
torques from tidally expelled nuclear material. Minor mergers ($q\lesssim1/3$)
on the other hand, form non-rotating cores and the tidal reversal becomes less
important. Low-density stellar cores scoured in (multiple) minor mergers are
less tangentially biased. This implies that the nuclear stellar properties of
massive ETGs can be solely explained by stellar dynamical processes during
their final assembly without any need for `feedback' from accreting black
holes. We predict a strong correlation between decoupled cores, central
anisotropy and merger history: decoupled cores form in binary mergers and we
predict them to occur in elliptical galaxies with the strongest central
anisotropy. Measurements of the central orbital structure are the key to
understanding the number of mergers a given galaxy has experienced.

a nonspinning effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model with enhanced analytical
information in its tidal sector. The tidal potential governing the conservative
dynamics employs resummed expressions based on post-Newtonian (PN) and
gravitational self-force (GSF) information. In particular, we compute a
GSF-resummed expression for the leading-order octupolar gravitoelectric term
and incorporate the leading-order gravitomagnetic term (either in PN-expanded

gravitoelectric and magnetic terms recently obtained in PN. The new analytical
information enhances tidal effects toward merger accelerating the coalescence.
We quantify the impact on the gravitational-wave phasing of each physical
effect. The most important contribution is given by the resummed
gravitoelectric octupolar term entering the EOB interaction potential, that can
yield up to 1~rad of dephasing (depending on the NS model) with respect to its
nonresummed version. The model's energetics and the gravitational wave phasing
are validated with eccentricity-reduced and multi-resolution numerical
relativity simulations with different equations of state and mass ratios. We
also present EOB-NR waveform comparisons for higher multipolar modes beyond the
dominant quadrupole one.

formation (SF) histories, forming most of their stars in periods of elevated SF

278.9$^{\circ} \pm 0.1^{\circ}$. A grid of models describing the spatial
distribution of the grains in the disk is generated to constrain the geometric
parameters of the disk and to explore the presence of a second belt. We perform
a photometric analysis of the data and compare disk brightness in two bands in
scattered and in polarized light. The analysis shows that the west side is
$\sim$2.5 times brighter in total intensity than the east side in both bands,
while for polarized light in the J band this ratio is only 1.25. The maximum
polarization fraction is 15--20% at $r\sim$2.5$''$. We also find that the J - H
color of the disk appears to be red for the radial separations $r\lesssim2''$

color from red to blue with an increasing radial separation could be explained
by the decreasing average grain size with distance. The presence of an
additional inner belt slightly inclined with respect to the main planetesimal
belt is suspected from the polarized intensity image but the analysis and
modeling presented here cannot establish a firm conclusion due to the faintness

depends on its mass and chemical composition. The surface heavy element
abundances of the solar-type stars are reasonably well determined using
conventional spectroscopy, however the second most abundant element helium is
not. This is due to the fact that the envelope temperature of such stars is not
high enough to excite helium. Since the helium abundance of a star affects its
structure and subsequent evolution, the uncertainty in the helium abundance of
a star makes estimates of its global properties (mass, radius, age etc.)
uncertain as well. The detections of the signatures of the acoustic glitches
from the precisely measured stellar oscillation frequencies provide an indirect
way to estimate the envelope helium content. We use the glitch signature caused
by the ionization of helium to determine the envelope helium abundance of 38
stars in the {\it Kepler} seismic LEGACY sample. Our results confirm that
atomic diffusion does indeed take place in solar-type stars. We use the
measured surface abundances in combination with the settling predicted by the
stellar models to determine the initial abundances. The initial helium and
metal mass fractions have subsequently been used to get the preliminary
estimates of the primordial helium abundance, $Y_p = 0.244\pm0.019$, and the
galactic enrichment ratio, $\Delta Y / \Delta Z = 1.226\pm0.849$. Although the
current estimates have large errorbars due to the limited sample size, this
method holds great promises to determine these parameters precisely in the era
of upcoming space missions.

evolution, and a detailed understanding of abundance patterns provides clues
regarding the nucleosynthetic production pathways of elements. Using the
SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey, we study radial gradients of chemical element
abundances in detail. We use stacked spectra out to 1 Re of 366 early-type
galaxies with masses 9.9 - 10.8 log $M/M_{\odot}$ to probe the abundances of
the elements C, N, Na, Mg, Ca, and Ti, relative to the abundance of Fe, by
fitting stellar population models to a combination of Lick absorption indices.
We find that C, Mg, and Ti trace each other both as a function of galaxy radius
and galaxy mass. These similar C and Mg abundances within and across galaxies
set a lower limit for star-formation timescales. Conversely, N and Ca are
generally offset to lower abundances. The under-abundance of Ca compared to Mg
implies delayed enrichment of Ca through Type Ia supernovae, whereas the
correlated behaviour of Ti and the lighter $\alpha$ elements, C and Mg, suggest
contributions to Ti from Type II supernovae. We obtain shallow radial gradients
in [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], meaning that these inferences are independent
of radius. However, we measure strong negative radial gradients for [N/Fe] and
[Na/Fe], of up to $-0.25\pm0.05$ and $-0.29\pm0.02$ dex/Re respectively. These
gradients become shallower with decreasing galaxy mass. We find that N and Na
abundances increase more steeply with velocity dispersion within galaxies than
globally, while the other elements show the same relation locally and globally.
This implies that the high Na and N abundances found in massive early type
galaxies are generated by internal processes within galaxies. These are
strongly correlated with the total metallicity, suggesting
metallicity-dependent Na enrichment, and secondary N production in massive
early-type galaxies.

fundamental to constrain theories of binary and planet formation. The planet
occurrence rate in binaries with a separation $\lesssim 50$ AU is only $\sim$
one third that of wider binaries or single stars. This may indicate that a
close companion has a ruinous influence on planet formation, because it can
truncate the protoplanetary disc and pump up planetesimals eccentricity and
collision probability. Nevertheless, observations have revealed a few of these
systems, which challenge current planet formation theories. Dynamical
interactions can deliver planets into S-type orbits. In this paper, we consider
as a possible scenario for forming S-type planets in close binaries the single
star-binary star interactions that commonly take place in star clusters. We
find that the final fraction and orbital properties of S-type planets in close
binaries are mainly determined by the mass ratio of the stars involved in the
close encounter, and the initial binary and planet semi-major axes. Present and
upcoming missions, as TESS, PLATO and CHEOPS may shed new light on the origin
of S-type planets in close binaries.

quantity of CSM in SN Ia systems, we performed a near-ultraviolet (NUV) survey

its ejecta and surrounding CSM at $664$ days after its light-curve peak. We
present ground- and space-based follow-up observations of SN 2015cp that reveal
optical emission lines of H and Ca, typical signatures of ejecta-CSM

our HST NUV images of SNe Ia were nondetections that we use to constrain the

momentum from an astrophysical black hole with mass $M\sim(5,10^{10})M_\odot$,
forming a nonspherical, rotating condensate around it. So far, most studies of
the evolution and end-state of the instability have been limited to initial
data containing only the fastest growing superradiant mode. By studying the
evolution of multimode data in a quasi-adiabatic approximation, we show that
the dynamics is much richer and depend strongly on the energy of the seed, on
the relative amplitude between modes, and on the gravitational coupling. If the
seed energy is a few percent of the black-hole mass, a black hole surrounded by
a mixture of superradiant and nonsuperradiant modes with comparable amplitudes
might not undergo a superradiant unstable phase, depending on the value of the
boson mass. If the seed energy is smaller, as in the case of an instability
triggered by quantum fluctuations, the effect of nonsuperradiant modes is
negligible. We discuss the implications of these findings for current
constraints on ultralight fields with electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
observations.

practical mmWave communication systems. Prior work addresses the problem of
designing hybrid precoders and combiner, yet focusing on finding solutions
under a total transmit power constraint. The design of hybrid precoders and
combiners in practical system, is constrained, however, by a per antenna
transmit power, since each antenna element in the array is connected to a power
amplifier (PA) that has to operate within its linear region. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of hybrid precoding and combining with per-antenna power
constraints, and under a frequency-selective bandlimited channel model. We
first propose an all-digital solution to this problem, and develop a hybrid
precoding and combining strategy that aims at matching this solution by
minimizing the chordal distance between the all-digital precoders (combiners)
and their hybrid approximations. Finally, since minimizing this metric does not
guarantee that the final spectral efficiency will be maximized, we optimize the
resulting spectral efficiency taking into account the per-antenna power
constraints. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our all-digital and
hybrid solutions, while emphasizing the differences with respect to the
corresponding solution under a total power constraints. As shown in our
numerical results, the proposed all-digital solution performs similarly to the
case in which a total power constraint is considered. Further, our proposed
hybrid solution is also shown to exhibit near-optimum performance, and the
influence of different system parameters is also shown, thereby showing the
suitability of our proposed framework to deploy practical mmWave MIMO systems.

accumulated from the different sources along with the process of relativistic
heavy ion collision developing. Those include the primary hard photons from the

the pre-thermal phase of matter evolution, then thermal photons at equilibrated
quark-gluon stage together with radiation displaying a confinement and,
finally, from the hadron gas phase. Along the way a hadronic medium evolution
is treated in two distinct, in a sense opposite, approaches: chemically
equilibrated and chemically frozen system expansion. We find that similar as it

salient features from the inlier class only, it is commonly assumed that images
of objects from outside of the training class cannot effectively be compressed
and reconstructed. Some thus consider reconstruction error as a kind of novelty
measure. Here we suggest that reconstruction-based approaches fail to capture
particular anomalies that lie far from known inlier samples in latent space but
near the latent dimension manifold defined by the parameters of the model. We
propose incorporating the Mahalanobis distance in latent space to better
capture these out-of-distribution samples and our results show that this method
often improves performance over the baseline approach.

a wide range of tasks. In this work, we ask to what extent can an adversary
steal functionality of such ""victim"" models based solely on blackbox
interactions: image in, predictions out. In contrast to prior work, we present
an adversary lacking knowledge of train/test data used by the model, its
internals, and semantics over model outputs. We formulate model functionality
stealing as a two-step approach: (i) querying a set of input images to the
blackbox model to obtain predictions; and (ii) training a ""knockoff"" with
queried image-prediction pairs. We make multiple remarkable observations: (a)
querying random images from a different distribution than that of the blackbox
training data results in a well-performing knockoff; (b) this is possible even
when the knockoff is represented using a different architecture; and (c) our
reinforcement learning approach additionally improves query sample efficiency
in certain settings and provides performance gains. We validate model
functionality stealing on a range of datasets and tasks, as well as on a
popular image analysis API where we create a reasonable knockoff for as little

$\beta$-Mn crystal structure are known to host skyrmion spin textures even at
elevated temperatures. As in other chiral cubic skyrmion hosts, skyrmion
lattices in these materials are found at equilibrium in a small pocket just
below the magnetic Curie temperature. Remarkably, CoxZnyMnz compounds have also
been found to host metastable non-equilibrium skyrmion lattices in a broad
temperature and field range, including down to zero-field and low temperature.
This behavior is believed to be related to disorder present in the materials.
Here, we use neutron and synchrotron diffraction, density functional theory
calculations, and DC and AC magnetic measurements, to characterize the atomic
and magnetic disorder in these materials. We demonstrate that Co has a strong
site-preference for the diamondoid 8c site in the crystal structure, while Mn
tends to share the geometrically frustrated 12d site with Zn, due to its
ability to develop a large local moment on that site. This magnetism-driven
site specificity leads to distinct magnetic behavior for the Co-rich 8c
sublattice and the Mn on the 12d sublattice. The Co-rich sublattice orders at
high temperatures (compositionally tunable between 100K to 470K) with a moment
around 1 $\mu_B$/atom and maintains this order to low temperature. The Mn-rich
sublattice holds larger moments (about 3 $\mu_B$ which remain fluctuating below
the Co moment ordering temperature. At lower temperature, the fluctuating Mn
moments freeze into a reentrant disordered cluster-glass state with no net
moment, while the Co moments maintain order. This two-sublattice behavior
allows for the observed coexistence of strong magnetic disorder and ordered
magnetic states such as helimagnetism and skyrmion lattices.

an equilibrium temperature > 4000 K. The high quantities of dissociated
hydrogen and atomic metals present in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b bear
more resemblance to a K-type star than a gas giant. We present a single
observation of KELT-9b during its secondary eclipse, taken with the Wide Field
Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT). This observation was taken in the
U-band, a window particularly sensitive to Rayleigh scattering. We do not
detect a secondary eclipse signal, but our 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 181 ppm on
the depth allows us to constrain the dayside temperature of KELT-9b at
pressures of ~30 mbar to 4995 K (3$\sigma$). Although we can place an
observational constraint of $A_g<$ 0.14, our models suggest that the actual
value is considerably lower than this due to H$^-$ opacity. This places KELT-9b
squarely in the albedo regime populated by its cooler cousins, almost all of

eigenvectors that encode important connectivity information about a graph or a
manifold. This connectivity information is often not cleanly represented in the
eigenvectors and must be disentangled by some secondary procedure. We propose
the use of an approximate sparse basis for the space spanned by the leading
eigenvectors as a natural, robust, and efficient means of performing this
separation. The use of sparsity yields a natural cutoff in this disentanglement
procedure and is particularly useful in practical situations when there is no
clear eigengap. In order to select a suitable collection of vectors we develop
a new Weyl-inspired eigengap heuristic and heuristics based on the sparse basis
vectors. We develop an automated eigenvector separation procedure and
illustrate its efficacy on examples from time-dependent dynamics on manifolds.
In this context, transfer operator approaches are extensively used to find
dynamically disconnected regions of phase space, known as almost-invariant sets
or coherent sets. The dominant eigenvectors of transfer operators or related
operators, such as the dynamic Laplacian, encode dynamic connectivity
information. Our sparse eigenbasis approximation (SEBA) methodology streamlines
the final stage of transfer operator methods, namely the extraction of
almost-invariant or coherent sets from the eigenvectors. It is particularly
useful when used on domains with large numbers of coherent sets, and when the
coherent sets do not exhaust the phase space, such as in large geophysical
datasets.

world in a completely different setting, enabling tasks like IKEA assembly from
diagrams. If robots could represent and infer high-level concepts, it would
significantly improve their ability to understand our intent and to transfer
tasks between different environments. To that end, we introduce a computational
framework that replicates aspects of human concept learning. Concepts are
represented as programs on a novel computer architecture consisting of a visual
perception system, working memory, and action controller. The instruction set
of this ""cognitive computer"" has commands for parsing a visual scene, directing
gaze and attention, imagining new objects, manipulating the contents of a
visual working memory, and controlling arm movement. Inferring a concept
corresponds to inducing a program that can transform the input to the output.
Some concepts require the use of imagination and recursion. Previously learned
concepts simplify the learning of subsequent more elaborate concepts, and
create a hierarchy of abstractions. We demonstrate how a robot can use these
abstractions to interpret novel concepts presented to it as schematic images,
and then apply those concepts in dramatically different situations. By bringing
cognitive science ideas on mental imagery, perceptual symbols, embodied
cognition, and deictic mechanisms into the realm of machine learning, our work
brings us closer to the goal of building robots that have interpretable
representations and commonsense.

investigate whether these models can accommodate non-zero spatial curvature. To
this end, we carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using data for the
observables associated with Type-Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers, the cosmic
microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations, as well as two values
for the Hubble constant. Then we include data relating to the growth of

taking LSS observations into account helps to tighten constraints and determine
a definite sign for the model parameters. In the case of the RVM and GRVS, the
addition of growth data results in dynamical vacuum energy being preferred to a
cosmological constant at a little over $1\sigma$. This happens in both the flat

cost of an extra parameter which can degrade the performance of the models (as
assessed by model selection criteria). Of special relevance is the fact that
the inclusion of LSS data appears to increase compatibility with a flat

private information, and limited in availability. Also, as they are accumulated
from everyday practices, it is often hard to have a balanced number of samples
for the types of diseases under study. These problems hinder the development of
ML and NLP methods for EMR data analysis. To tackle these problems, we
developed a model to generate synthetic text of EMRs called Medical Text
Generative Adversarial Network or mtGAN. It is based on the GAN framework and
is trained by the REINFORCE algorithm. It takes disease features as inputs and
generates synthetic texts as EMRs for the corresponding diseases. We evaluate
the model from micro-level, macro-level and application-level on a Chinese EMR
text dataset. The results show that the method has a good capacity to fit real

efficiently explore the input space using a small number of samples, i.e., the

purely random design is superior to higher-powered alternatives. We then
propose a family of new schemes by reverse engineering the qualities of the

- ranging from generative models (VAEs, GANs), sequence to sequence models used
in machine translation and speech processing to models over functional spaces
(conditional neural processes, neural processes). Given the size and complexity
of these models, safely deploying them in applications requires the development
of tools to analyze their behavior rigorously and provide some guarantees that
these models are consistent with a list of desirable properties or
specifications. For example, a machine translation model should produce
semantically equivalent outputs for innocuous changes in the input to the
model. A functional regression model that is learning a distribution over
monotonic functions should predict a larger value at a larger input.
Verification of these properties requires a new framework that goes beyond
notions of verification studied in deterministic feedforward networks, since
requiring worst-case guarantees in probabilistic models is likely to produce
conservative or vacuous results. We propose a novel formulation of verification
for deep probabilistic models that take in conditioning inputs and sample
latent variables in the course of producing an output: We require that the
output of the model satisfies a linear constraint with high probability over
the sampling of latent variables and for every choice of conditioning input to
the model. We show that rigorous lower bounds on the probability that the
constraint is satisfied can be obtained efficiently. Experiments with neural
processes show that several properties of interest while modeling functional
spaces can be modeled within this framework (monotonicity, convexity) and

Frobenius eigenvalues of $M$ with bounded slope. This is a purely $p$-adic
phenomenon; there is no counterpart in the theory of lisse $\ell$-adic sheaves.
The graded pieces of this slope filtration correspond to lisse $p$-adic
sheaves, which we call geometric. Geometric lisse $p$-adic sheaves are
mysterious. While they fit together to build an overconvergent $F$-isocrystal,
which should have motivic origin, individually they are not motivic. In this

polynomials in $p^n$, which implies a variant of Wan's genus stability
conjecture. The crux of the proof is the theory of $F$-isocrystals with
log-decay. We prove a monodromy theorem for these $F$-isocrystals, as well as a
theorem relating the slopes of $M$ to the rate of log-decay of the slope

as an alternative to harmonic homeomorphisms. It opens a new area of study in
Geometric Function Theory (GFT). Much of the foregoing is motivated by the
principle of non-interpenetration of matter in the mathematical theory of
Nonlinear Elasticity (NE). The question we are concerned with is whether or not
a Dirichlet energy-minimal mapping between Jordan domains with a prescribed
boundary homeomorphism remains injective in the domain. The classical theorem
of Rad\'{o}-Kneser-Choquet asserts that this is the case when the target domain
is convex. An alternative way to deal with arbitrary target domains is to
minimize the Dirichlet energy subject to only homeomorphisms and their limits.
This leads to the so called Hopf-Laplace equation. Among its solutions (some
rather surreal) are continuous monotone mappings of Sobolev class $\mathscr
W^{1,2}_{{loc}}$, called monotone Hopf-harmonics. It is at the heart of the
present paper to show that such solutions are correct generalizations of
harmonic homeomorphisms and, in particular, are legitimate deformations of
hyperelastic materials in the modern theory of NE. We make this clear by means
of several examples.

the latent encodings of the data having an appropriate level of overlap, and b)
the aggregate encoding of the data conforming to a desired structure,

explicit independence between latents, as a special case, but also allows for a
much richer class of properties to be imposed on the learnt representation,

hierarchical dependency relationships. We show that the $\beta$-VAE varies from
the standard VAE predominantly in its control of latent overlap and that for
the standard choice of an isotropic Gaussian prior, its objective is invariant
to rotations of the latent representation. Viewed from the decomposition
perspective, breaking this invariance with simple manipulations of the prior
can yield better disentanglement with little or no detriment to
reconstructions. We further demonstrate how other choices of prior can assist
in producing different decompositions and introduce an alternative training
objective that allows the control of both decomposition factors in a principled
manner.

real-time UAV applications against malicious attacks has become an urgent
problem that needs to be solved. Denial-of-service (DoS) attack aims to exhaust
system resources and cause important tasks to miss deadlines. DoS attack may be
one of the common problems of UAV systems, due to its simple implementation. In
this paper, we present a software framework that offers DoS attack-resilient
control for real-time UAV systems using containers: ContainerDrone. The
framework provides defense mechanisms for three critical system resources: CPU,
memory, and communication channel. We restrict attacker's access to CPU core
set and utilization. Memory bandwidth throttling limits attacker's memory
usage. By simulating sensors and drivers in the container, a security monitor
constantly checks DoS attacks over communication channels. Upon the detection
of a security rule violation, the framework switches to the safety controller
to mitigate the attack. We implemented a prototype quadcopter with commercially
off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open-source software. Our experimental
results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework defending

These interfaces exhibit a complex interplay between elasticity, low Reynolds

biological processes such as cellular traffic, division, migration, or tissue

problems, in which interfacial phenomena tightly interact with the shape and
dynamics of the surface, we develop a general continuum mechanics and
computational framework for fluid deformable surfaces. The dual solid-fluid
nature of fluid deformable surfaces challenges classical Lagrangian or Eulerian
descriptions of deforming bodies. Here, we extend the notion of Arbitrarily
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulations, well-established for bulk media, to
deforming surfaces. To systematically develop models for fluid deformable
surfaces, which consistently treat all couplings between fields and geometry,
we follow a nonlinear Onsager formalism according to which the dynamics
minimize a Rayleighian functional where dissipation, power input and energy
release rate compete. Finally, we propose new computational methods, which
build on Onsager's formalism and our ALE formulation, to deal with the
resulting stiff system of higher-order of partial differential equations. We
apply our theoretical and computational methodology to classical models for

has successfully identified anomalies in social media, email, and IP

IDS alert graph is assigned a probability distribution across a small set of
roles based on that node's features. A cyber attack should trigger IDS alerts

training a model, a machine learning algorithm must be selected. Also, the
values of one or more model parameters termed hyper-parameters must be set.
Selecting algorithms and hyper-parameter values requires advanced machine
learning knowledge and many labor-intensive manual iterations. To lower the bar
to machine learning, miscellaneous automatic selection methods for algorithms
and/or hyper-parameter values have been proposed. Existing automatic selection
methods are inefficient on large data sets. This poses a challenge for using
machine learning in the clinical big data era. Methods: To address the
challenge, this paper presents progressive sampling-based Bayesian
optimization, an efficient and automatic selection method for both algorithms
and hyper-parameter values. Results: We report an implementation of the method.
We show that compared to a state of the art automatic selection method, our
method can significantly reduce search time, classification error rate, and
standard deviation of error rate due to randomization. Conclusions: This is
major progress towards enabling fast turnaround in identifying high-quality

traffic and keep the network healthy. Flow-level measurement is widely used
because it provides rich enough information while being resource efficient, in
contrast to the traffic-level solutions like SNMP and packet-level solutions
like tcpdump. Flow-level measurement requires to maintain a TFR for each active
flow, and update the corresponding TFR when a packet arrives. In the scenario
of high-speed networks, the processing time for each packet is only several or
tens of nanoseconds, and there may be up to millions of concurrent active
flows. Two requirements have to be met to be able to do flow-level measurement
in this scenario, i.e., the memory size have to be large enough to maintain a
TFR for each flow, and the access time of the memory have to be small enough to
be able to update the TFR for each packet. Unfortunately, SRAM, which is fast
enough, is expensive and there are limited amount available for the measurement
tasks, while DRAM, which is large in capacity, is slow and cannot support the
per-packet access. In this paper, we proposed a solution, PriMe, by combining
SRAM with DRAM, overcoming the resource limitation by exporting TFRs to the
DRAM when necessary, while enjoying the fast access of SRAM. We designed a
peculiar algorithm to reduce the frequency of exporting TFRs to DRAM, as well
as an algorithm to reduce the accesses of DRAM in aggregating the TFRs exported
from SRAM.

High-precision spatial control of the MW field necessary to drive the

report a controlled MW field distribution by excitation of a micrometer-scale
gold pattern in vicinity of the diamond surface. The gold pattern excited by a
planar ring MW antenna, acts as a receiving antenna and redistribute the MW
field in a localized area, without a direct feed of electrical current. The
planar ring MW antenna is designed to generate a uniform MW field on diamond
substrate in an area of 0.785 mm$^{2}$, providing a useful tool for detecting
the MW variations. We performed the imaging of the localized MW intensity on
the micrometer-scale gold pattern by direct observation of electron spin Rabi
oscillations, showing also the potential application of NV centers for imaging
MW field and characterization of MW devices. We achieved an enhancement of
about 19 times for the Rabi frequency on a scale of few micrometers for the
gold pattern, compared to the bulk Rabi frequency in presence of the single
planar ring MW antenna. Compared to previous methods, our method has been shown
as a fast and easy tool for the spatial control of MW fields and spin
manipulation of NV centers in diamond.

are often corrupted by noises in the sensing process, which will further
deteriorate the performance of higher-level classification and recognition
tasks. In this paper, we propose a Low-rank Tensor Dictionary Learning (LTDL)
method for MSI denoising. Firstly, we extract blocks from the MSI and cluster
them into groups. Then instead of using the exactly low-rank model, we consider
a nearly low-rank approximation, which is closer to the latent low-rank
structure of the clean groups of real MSIs. In addition, we propose to learn an
spatial dictionary and an spectral dictionary, which contain the spatial
features and spectral features respectively of the whole MSI and are shared
among different groups. Hence the LTDL method utilizes both the latent low-rank
prior of each group and the correlation of different groups via the shared
dictionaries. Experiments on synthetic data validate the effectiveness of
dictionary learning by the LTDL. Experiments on real MSIs demonstrate the
superior denoising performance of the proposed method in comparison to

Cucker-Smale(TCS) models equipped with temperature as an extra observable on
general digraph. In previous literature, the emergent behaviors of the TCS
models were mainly studied on a complete graph, or symmetric connected graphs.
Under this symmetric setting, the total momentum is a conserved quantity. This
determines the asymptotic velocity and temperature a priori using the initial
data only. Moreover, this conservation law plays a crucial role in the flocking
analysis based on the elementary $\ell_2$ energy estimates. In this paper, we
consider a more general connection topology which is registered by a general
digraph, and the weights between particles are given to be inversely
proportional to the metric distance between them. Due to this possible symmetry
breaking in communication, the total momentum is not a conserved quantity, and
this lack of conservation law makes the asymptotic velocity and temperature
depend on the whole history of solutions. To circumvent this lack of
conservation laws, we instead employ some tools from matrix theory on the
scrambling matrices and some detailed analysis on the state-transition
matrices. We present two sufficient frameworks for the emergence of
mono-cluster flockings on a digraph for the continuous and discrete models. Our
sufficient frameworks are given in terms of system parameters and initial data.

originating from a single band. A generalization of this picture occurs in

to superconductivity. The contributions of the different bands can result in an
overall enhancement of the critical field and can lead to qualitative changes
in the temperature dependence of the upper critical field when compared to the
single-band case. While the role of orbital pair-breaking on the critical field
of multi-band superconductors has been explored extensively, paramagnetic and

Here we investigate this problem using thin films of Nd-doped SrTiO$_3$. We
furthermore propose a model for analyzing the temperature-dependence of the
critical field in the presence of orbital, paramagnetic and spin-orbital
effects, and find a very good agreement with our data. Interestingly, we also
observe a dramatic enhancement in the out-of-plane critical field to values
well in excess of the Chandrasekhar-Clogston (Pauli) paramagnetic limit, which
can be understood as a consequence of multi-band effects in the presence of
spin-orbital scattering.

free energy calculations to identify for the first time a limit of stability
(spinodal) and a change in the nucleation mechanism in aqueous NaCl solutions.
This is a system of considerable atmospheric, geological and technical
significance. We find that the supersaturated metastable NaCl solution reaches
its limit of stability at sufficiently high salt concentrations, as indicated
by the composition dependence of the salt chemical potential, indicating the
transition to a phase separation by spinodal decomposition. However, the
metastability limit of the NaCl solution does not correspond to spinodal
decomposition with respect to crystallization. We find that beyond this
spinodal, a liquid/amorphous separation occurs in the aqueous solution, whereby
the ions first form disordered clusters. We term these clusters as ""amorphous
salt"". We also identify a transition from one- to two-step crystallization
mechanism driven by a spinodal. In particular, crystallization from aqueous
NaCl solution beyond the spinodal is a two-step process, in which the ions
first phase-separate into disordered amorphous salt clusters, followed by the
crystallization of ions in the amorphous salt phase. In contrast, in the
aqueous NaCl solution at concentrations lower than the spinodal,
crystallization occurs via a one-step process, as the ions aggregate directly
into crystalline nuclei. The change of mechanism with increasing
supersaturation underscores the importance of an accurate determination of the
driving force for phase separation. The study has broader implications on the
mechanism for nucleation of crystals from solutions at high supersaturations.

most star trackers use conventional optical sensors. In this application paper,
we propose the usage of event sensors for star tracking. There are potentially
two benefits of using event sensors for star tracking: lower power consumption
and higher operating speeds. Our main contribution is to formulate an
algorithmic pipeline for star tracking from event data that includes novel
formulations of rotation averaging and bundle adjustment. In addition, we also
release with this paper a dataset for star tracking using event cameras. With
this work, we introduce the problem of star tracking using event cameras to the
computer vision community, whose expertise in SLAM and geometric optimisation
can be brought to bear on this commercially important application.

has opportunities to appear in the linear conductance spectrum of the Andreev

or even a lack of convergence altogether; thus, practitioners often utilize ad
hoc regularization terms added to the energy functional. When carefully
crafted, these regularizations can produce compelling results. However,
regularization changes both the energy landscape and the solution to the
optimization problem, which can result in underfitting. Surprisingly, many
practitioners both add regularization and claim that their model lacks the
expressivity to fit the data. Motivated by a geometric interpretation of the
linearized search space, we propose an approach that ameliorates overfitting
without the need for regularization terms that restrict the expressiveness of
the underlying model. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach on
minimization problems related to three-dimensional facial expression estimation
where overfitting clouds semantic understanding and regularization may lead to
underfitting that misses or misinterprets subtle expressions.

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZExENE50I0",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to restore a photo-realistic
high-resolution (HR) video frame from both its corresponding low-resolution
(LR) frame (reference frame) and multiple neighboring frames (supporting
frames). Due to varying motion of cameras or objects, the reference frame and
each support frame are not aligned. Therefore, temporal alignment is a
challenging yet important problem for VSR. Previous VSR methods usually utilize
optical flow between the reference frame and each supporting frame to wrap the
supporting frame for temporal alignment. Therefore, the performance of these
image-level wrapping-based models will highly depend on the prediction accuracy
of optical flow, and inaccurate optical flow will lead to artifacts in the
wrapped supporting frames, which also will be propagated into the reconstructed
HR video frame. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a
temporal deformable alignment network (TDAN) to adaptively align the reference
frame and each supporting frame at the feature level without computing optical
flow. The TDAN uses features from both the reference frame and each supporting
frame to dynamically predict offsets of sampling convolution kernels. By using
the corresponding kernels, TDAN transforms supporting frames to align with the
reference frame. To predict the HR video frame, a reconstruction network taking
aligned frames and the reference frame is utilized. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TDAN-based VSR model.

based on a relationship recently established by the authors between periodic
billiard trajectories and extremal polynomials on the systems of $d$ intervals

the planar case, systematically studied in the present paper it leads to new
results in characterizing $n$ periodic trajectories vs. so-called $n$ elliptic
periodic trajectories, which are $n$-periodic in elliptical coordinates. The
characterizations are done both in terms of the underlying elliptic curve and
divisors on it and in terms of polynomial functional equations, like Pell's
equation. This new approach also sheds light on some classical results. In
particular we connect search for caustics which generate periodic trajectories
with three classical classes of extremal polynomials on two intervals,
introduced by Zolotarev and Akhiezer. The main classifying tool are winding
numbers, for which we provide several interpretations, including one in terms
of numbers of points of alternance of extremal polynomials. The latter implies
important inequality between the winding numbers, which as a consequence,
provides another proof of monotonicity of rotation numbers. A complete catalog
of billiard trajectories with small periods is provided for $n=3, 4, 5, 6$

connection between Cayle type conditions and discriminantly separable

promising technology to provide high-quality mobile services (e.g., fast
Internet access, edge computing, and local caching) to ground users. Major
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) want to enable UAV-provided services (UPS) to
improve and enrich the current mobile services for additional profit. This
profit-maximization problem is not easy as the UAV has limited energy storage
and needs to fly closely to serve users, requiring an optimal energy allocation
for balancing both hovering time and service capacity. When hovering in a
hotspot, how the UAV should dynamically price its capacity-limited UPS
according to randomly arriving users with private service valuations is another
question. We prove that the UAV should ask for a higher price if the leftover
hovering time is longer or its service capacity is smaller, and its expected
profit approaches to that under complete user information if the hovering time
is sufficiently large. As the hotspot's user occurrence rate increases, a
shorter hovering time or a larger service capacity should be allocated.
Finally, when the UAV faces multiple hotspot candidates with different user
occurrence rates and flying distances, we prove that it is optimal to deploy
the UAV to serve a single hotspot. With multiple UAVs, however, this result can
be reversed with UAVs' forking deployment to different hotspots.

systems using snapshots of single-cell transcripts requires state-of-the-art
methods of computational analysis and statistical inference. A Bayesian
approach to statistical inference is the most complete method for model
selection and uncertainty quantification of kinetic parameters from single-cell
data. This approach is impractical because current numerical algorithms are too
slow to handle typical models of gene expression. To solve this problem, we
first show that time-dependent mRNA distributions of discrete-state models of
gene expression are dynamic Poisson mixtures, whose mixing kernels are
characterized by a piece-wise deterministic Markov process. We combined this
analytical result with a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to create a hybrid
numerical method that accelerates the calculation of time-dependent mRNA
distributions by 1000-fold compared to current methods. We then integrated the
hybrid algorithm into an existing Monte Carlo sampler to estimate the Bayesian
posterior distribution of many different, competing models in a reasonable
amount of time. We validated our method of accelerated Bayesian inference on
several synthetic data sets. Our results show that kinetic parameters can be
reasonably constrained for modestly sampled data sets, if the model is known
\textit{a priori}. If the model is unknown,the Bayesian evidence can be used to
rigorously quantify the likelihood of a model relative to other models from the
data. We demonstrate that Bayesian evidence selects the true model and
outperforms approximate metrics, e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), often used for model selection.

densities for 1100 compact extragalactic radio sources that were not observed
before 2008 at high angular resolution. The catalogue spans the declination
range -90 deg, -30 deg and was constructed from nineteen 24-hour VLBI observing
sessions with the Australian Long Baseline Array at 8.3 GHz. The catalogue
presents the final part of the program that was started in 2008. The goals of
that campaign were 1) to extend the number of compact radio sources with
precise coordinates and measure their correlated flux densities, which can be
used for phase referencing VLBI and ALMA observations, geodetic VLBI, search
for sources with significant offsets with respect to Gaia positions, and space
navigation; 2) to extend the complete flux-limited sample of compact
extragalactic sources to the Southern Hemisphere; and 3) to investigate the
parsec-scale properties of sources from the high-frequency AT20G survey. The
median uncertainty of the source positions is 3.5 mas. As a result of this VLBI
campaign, the number of compact radio sources south of declination -40 deg
which have measured VLBI correlated flux densities and positions known to
milliarcsecond accuracy has increased by over a factor of 6.

(DDI) on the thermodynamic properties of a homogeneous electron gas at zero
temperature is investigated. Through the second quantization formalism, the
analytic expressions for the ground state energy and the DDI energy are
obtained. In this paper, the DDI energy has similarities with the previous
works done by others. We show that its general behavior depends on density and
the total angular momentum. Especially, it is found that the DDI energy has a
highly state-dependent behavior. With the growth of density, the magnitude of
DDI energy, which is found to be the summation of all energy contributions of
the states with even and odd total angular momenta, grows linearly. It is also
found that for the states with even and odd total angular momenta, the DDI
energy contributions are corresponding to the positive and negative values,
respectively. In particular, an increase of total angular momentum leads to
decline in the magnitude of energy contribution. Therefore, the dipole dipole
interaction reveals distinct characteristics in comparison with central like
interactions.

approximation-theory-based multifidelity method and
Gaussian-process-regression-based multifidelity method to achieve data-model
convergence when stochastic simulation models and sparse accurate observation
data are available. Specifically, the two types of multifidelity methods we use
are the bifidelity and CoKriging methods. The new approach uses the bifidelity
method to efficiently estimate the empirical mean and covariance of the
stochastic simulation outputs, then it uses these statistics to construct a
Gaussian process (GP) representing low-fidelity in CoKriging. We also combine
the bifidelity method with Kriging, where the approximated empirical statistics
are used to construct the GP as well. We prove that the resulting posterior
mean by the new physics-informed approach preserves linear physical constraints
up to an error bound. By using this method, we can obtain an accurate
construction of a state of interest based on a partially correct physical model
and a few accurate observations. We present numerical examples to demonstrate
performance of the method.

optically thick and Eddington-limited. If most of the hard X-rays from the
central disk are obscured by the wind, the source will display a blackbody-like
spectrum with a luminosity scaled with the mass of the compact object. From the
Chandra archive of nearby galaxies, we selected a sample of luminous and very
soft sources and excluded contaminations from foreground objects and supernova
remnants. They are found to be preferentially associated with late-type
galaxies. The majority of sources in our sample are either too hot or too
luminous to be explained by nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs, and
are argued to be powered by accretion. The most likely explanation is that they
are due to emission from the photosphere of a wind driven by supercritical
accretion onto compact objects. Their blackbody luminosity ranges from ~10^37
to nearly 10^40 erg/s, indicative of the presence of both neutron stars and
stellar-mass black holes. The blackbody luminosity also shows a possible
bimodal distribution, albeit at low significance, peaked around the Eddington
limit for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, respectively. If this can
be confirmed, it will be smoking gun evidence that supercritical accretion
powers thick winds. Based on a wind model, the inferred mass accretion rate of
these objects is around a few hundred times the Eddington rate, suggesting that
they may be intermediate between the canonical ultraluminous X-ray sources and
SS 433 in terms of the accretion rate.

point matching problem is a key step while reconstructing target objects.
Conventional algorithms can only find a small number of feature points from two
images which is quite insufficient for reconstruction. To overcome this
problem, we propose SeFM a sequential feature point matching algorithm. We
first utilize the epipolar geometry to find the epipole of each image. Rotating
along the epipole, we generate a set of the epipolar lines and reserve those
intersecting with the input image. Next, a rough matching phase, followed by a
dense matching phase, is applied to find the matching dot-pairs using dynamic
programming. Furthermore, we also remove wrong matching dot-pairs by
calculating the validity. Experimental results illustrate that SeFM can achieve
around 1,000 to 10,000 times matching dot-pairs, depending on individual image,
compared to conventional algorithms and the object reconstruction with only two
images is semantically visible. Moreover, it outperforms conventional
algorithms, such as SIFT and SURF, regarding precision and recall.

Control (NMPC) schemes; i.e. NMPC schemes employing stage costs that are not
directly related to distance measures of pre-computed setpoints. At the same
time, with respect to the energy transition, the use of NMPC schemes is
proposed and investigated in a plethora of papers in different contexts. For
example receding-horizon approaches to generator dispatch problems, which is
also known as multi-stage Optimal Power Flow (OPF), naturally lead to economic
NMPC schemes based on non-convex discrete-time Optimal Control Problems (OCP).
The present paper investigates the transfer of analytic results available for
general economic NMPC schemes to receding-horizon multistage OPF. We propose a
blueprint formulation of multi-stage opf including AC power flow equations.
Based on this formulation we present results on the dissipativity and recursive
feasibility properties of the underlying OCP. Finally, we draw upon simulations
using a 5 bus system and a 118 bus system to illustrate our findings.

surveillance. For a real-world person re-identification application, in order
to guarantee an optimal time response, it is crucial to find the balance
between accuracy and speed. We analyse this trade-off, comparing a classical
method, that comprises hand-crafted feature description and metric learning, in
particular, LOMO and XQDA, to deep learning based techniques, using image
classification networks, ResNet and MobileNets. Additionally, we propose and
analyse network distillation as a learning strategy to reduce the computational
cost of the deep learning approach at test time. We evaluate both methods on
the Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID large-scale datasets, showing that
distillation helps reducing the computational cost at inference time while even
increasing the accuracy performance.

unusual $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory which is dual to the 3D Ising model with not
only nearest-neighbor (nn) coupling, but also next-nearest-neighbor (nnn)
coupling. Our gauge theory has on each edge four $Z_2$ variables that have
product $+1$, each located on a vector perpendicular to the edge. The nn
coupling in the Ising model maps to the plaquette term in the gauge theory
where the four variables multiplied have their vectors pointing inward, while
the nnn coupling maps to the coupling between the $Z_2$ variables on nearby
vectors on each edge in the gauge theory. A Wilson loop observable in the gauge
theory depends on a framing of a loop, and maps to a surface of flipped-sign nn
and nnn couplings in the Ising model. Further numerical simulations could be
made to explore the universality at the phase transition.

(transient faults) as high-performance computing systems increase in scale. The
common practice to evaluate the resilience to faults of an application is
random fault injection, a method that can be highly time consuming. While
resilience prediction modeling has been recently proposed to predict
application resilience in a faster way than fault injection, it can only
predict a single class of fault manifestation (SDC) and there is no evidence
demonstrating that it can work on previously unseen programs, which greatly
limits its re-usability. We present PARIS, a resilience prediction method that
addresses the problems of existing prediction methods using machine learning.
Using carefully-selected features and a machine learning model, our method is
able to make resilience predictions of three classes of fault manifestations
(success, SDC, and interruption) as opposed to one class like in current
resilience prediction modeling. The generality of our approach allows us to
make prediction on new applications, i.e., previously unseen applications,
providing large applicability to our model. Our evaluation on 125 programs
shows that PARIS provides high prediction accuracy, 82% and 77% on average for
predicting the rate of success and interruption, respectively, while the
state-of-the-art resilience prediction model cannot predict them. When
predicting the rate of SDC, PARIS provides much better accuracy than the
state-of-the-art (38% vs. -273%). PARIS is much faster (up to 450x speedup)
than the traditional method (random fault injection).

functional theory (DFT). Here it is demonstrated that the Dean-Kawasaki
equation can be directly linearized in the first approximation of the driving
force due to the free energy functional $F[\rho] $ of an instantaneous density
distribution $\rho$, when we consider small density fluctuations around a
metastable state whose density distribution $\rho^*$ is determined by the
stationary equation $\delta F[\rho]/\delta \rho|_{\rho=\rho^*}=\mu$ with $\mu$

thermodynamics has been formulated, showing that the heat dissipated into the
reservoir is negligible on average. Next, (ii) we have developed a field
theoretic treatment combined with the equilibrium DFT, giving an approximate
form of $F[\rho]$ that is related to the equilibrium free energy functional.
Accordingly, (iii) the linear Dean-Kawasaki equation, which has been reduced to
a tractable form expressed by the direct correlation function, allows us to
compare the stochastic dynamics around metastable and equilibrium states,

long-term influence on the underlying population. Yet fairness considerations

among groups within the population. The most basic notion of balance is
eventual equality between the qualifications of the groups. How can we
incorporate influence dynamics in decision making? How well do
dynamics-oblivious fairness policies fare in terms of reaching equality? In
this paper, we propose a simple yet revealing model that encompasses (1) a
selection process where an institution chooses from multiple groups according
to their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility and (2)
dynamics that govern the evolution of the groups' qualifications according to
the imposed policies. We focus on demographic parity as the formalism of
affirmative action.
  We then give conditions under which an unconstrained policy reaches equality
on its own. In this case, surprisingly, imposing demographic parity may break
equality. When it doesn't, one would expect the additional constraint to reduce
utility, however, we show that utility may in fact increase. In more realistic
scenarios, unconstrained policies do not lead to equality. In such cases, we
show that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it, there is a danger
that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a silver lining, we
also identify when the constraint not only leads to equality, but also improves
all groups. This gives quantifiable insight into both sides of the mismatch
hypothesis. These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in determining when and
how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection processes, both
for the institution and for society on the long run.

the rigid phase are only suppressed up to a finite lengthscale. This length
scale grows and diverges at the critical point of the rigidity transition, such
that the system is hyperuniform in the fluid phase. This suggests that
hyperuniformity is a feature generically absent in jammed solids. Surprisingly,
corresponding fluctuations in geometrical properties of the model are found to
be strongly suppressed over an even greater but still finite lengthscale,
indicating that the system self organizes in preference to suppress geometrical
fluctuations at the expense of incurring density fluctuations.

subject of numerous studies. It harbors a massive dark matter (DM) halo which
may span up to ~600 kpc across and comprises ~90% of the galaxy's total mass.
This halo size translates into a large diameter of 42 degrees on the sky for an
M31-Milky Way (MW) distance of 785 kpc, but its presumably low surface
brightness makes it challenging to detect with gamma-ray telescopes. Using 7.6
years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observations, we make a
detailed study of the gamma-ray emission between 1-100 GeV towards M31's outer
halo, with a total field radius of 60 degrees centered at M31, and perform an
in-depth analysis of the systematic uncertainties related to the observations.
We use the cosmic ray (CR) propagation code GALPROP to construct specialized
interstellar emission models (IEMs) to characterize the foreground gamma-ray
emission from the MW, including a self-consistent determination of the
isotropic component. We find evidence for an extended excess that appears to be
distinct from the conventional MW foreground, having a total radial extension
upwards of ~120-200 kpc from the center of M31. We discuss plausible
interpretations of the excess emission but emphasize that uncertainties in the
MW foreground, and in particular, modeling of the H I-related components, have
not been fully explored and may impact the results. This study was first
presented in a poster at the 8th International Fermi Symposium. The article
describing the full analysis is under preparation and will be published

at weak disorder in the vicinity of flat-band energies. A careful distinction
is made between situations where the scaling functions are universal (i.e.,
depend on the disorder distribution only through its width) and where they keep
depending on the full shape of the disorder distribution, even in the
weak-disorder scaling regime. Three examples are analyzed in detail. On the
stub chain, one central flat band is isolated from two lateral dispersive ones.
The localization length remains microscopic at weak disorder and exhibits
disorder-specific features. On the pyrochlore ladder, the two flat bands are
tangent to a dispersive one. The localization length diverges with exponent 1/2
and a non-universal scaling law, whose dependence on the disorder distribution
is predicted analytically. On the diamond chain, a central flat band intersects
two symmetric dispersive ones. The localization length exhibits two successive
scaling regimes, diverging first with exponent 4/3 and a universal law, and
then (i.e., further away from the pristine flat band) with exponent 1 and a
non-universal law. Both scaling functions are also derived by analytical means.

(CWB) systems produces two shock fronts, delimiting the wind collision region
(WCR). There, particles are expected to be accelerated mainly via diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA). We investigate the injection and the acceleration of
protons in typical CWB systems by means of Monte Carlo simulations, with both a
test-particle approach and a non-linear method modelling a shock locally
modified by the backreaction of the accelerated protons. We use
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the background plasma in the WCR
and its vicinity. This allows us to consider particle acceleration at both
shocks, on either side of the WCR, with a realistic large-scale magnetic field.
We highlight the possible effects of particle acceleration on the local shock
profiles at the WCR. We include the effect of magnetic field amplification due
to resonant streaming instability (RSI), and compare results without and with
the backreaction of the accelerated protons. In the latter case we find a lower
flux of the non-thermal proton population, and a considerable magnetic field
amplification. This would significantly increase the synchrotron losses of
relativistic electrons accelerated in CWB systems, lowering the maximal energy
they can reach and strongly reducing the inverse Compton fluxes. As a result,
$\gamma$-rays from CWBs would be predominantly due to the decay of neutral
pions produced in nucleon-nucleon collisions. This might provide a way to
explain why, in the vast majority of cases, CWB systems have not been
identified as $\gamma$-ray sources, while they emit synchrotron radiation.

several authors that a generic Lagrangian depending on the Riemann tensor
describes a theory with 8 degrees of freedom (which reduce to 3 for f(R)
Lagrangians depending only on the curvature scalar). This result is often
related to a reformulation of the fourth-order equations for the metric into a
set of second-order equations for a multiplet of fields, including a massive
scalar field and a massive spin-2 field. In this article we investigate an
issue which does not seem to have been addressed so far: in ordinary
general-relativistic field theories, all fundamental fields (i.e. fields with
definite spin and mass) reduce to test fields in some appropriate limit of the
model, where they cease to act as sources for the metric curvature. In this
limit, each of the fundamental fields can be excited from its ground state
independently from the others. The question is: does higher-derivative gravity
admit a test-field limit for its fundamental fields? It is easy to show that
for a f(R) theory the test-field limit does exist; then, we consider the case
of Lagrangians quadratically depending on the full Ricci tensor. We show that
the constraint binding together the scalar field and the massive spin-2 field
does not disappear in the limit where they should be expected to act as test
fields, except for a particular choice of the Lagrangian, which cause the
scalar field to disappear (reducing to 7 DOF). We finally consider the addition
of an arbitrary function of the quadratic invariant of the Weyl tensor and show
that the resulting model still lacks a proper test-field limit. We argue that
the lack of a test-field limit for the fundamental fields may constitute a
serious drawback of the full 8 DOF higher-order gravity models, which is not
encountered in the restricted 7 DOF or 3 DOF cases.

of the code transmitted over the web. We study the problem of minifying
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) --- the de facto language for styling web
documents. Traditionally, CSS minifiers focus on simple syntactic
transformations (e.g. shortening colour names). In this paper, we propose a new
minification method based on merging similar rules in a CSS file.
  We consider safe transformations of CSS files, which preserve the semantics
of the CSS file. The semantics of CSS files are sensitive to the ordering of
rules in the file. To automatically identify a rule merging opportunity that
best minimises file size, we reduce the rule-merging problem to a problem on
CSS-graphs, i.e., node-weighted bipartite graphs with a dependency ordering on
the edges, where weights capture the number of characters (e.g. in a selector
or in a property declaration). Roughly speaking, the corresponding CSS-graph
problem concerns minimising the total weight of a sequence of bicliques
(complete bipartite subgraphs) that covers the CSS-graph and respects the edge
order.
  We provide the first full formalisation of CSS3 selectors and reduce
dependency detection to satisfiability of quantifier-free integer linear
arithmetic, for which highly-optimised SMT-solvers are available. To solve the
above NP-hard graph optimisation problem, we show how Max-SAT solvers can be
effectively employed. We have implemented our algorithms using Max-SAT and
SMT-solvers as backends, and tested against approximately 70 real-world
examples (including the top 20 most popular websites). In our benchmarks, our
tool yields larger savings than six well-known minifiers (which do not perform
rule-merging, but support many other optimisations). Our experiments also
suggest that better savings can be achieved in combination with one of these
six minifiers.

items, one per period, via a dynamic auction. At the beginning of each period,
each buyer draws a private valuation for the item to be sold in that period and
this valuation is independent across buyers and periods. The auction can be
dynamic in the sense that the auction at period $t$ can be conditional on the
bids in that period and all previous periods, subject to certain appropriately
defined incentive compatible and individually rational conditions. Perhaps not
surprisingly, the revenue optimal dynamic auctions are computationally hard to
find and existing literatures that aim to approximate the optimal auctions are
all based on solving complex dynamic programs. It remains largely open on the
structural interpretability of the optimal dynamic auctions.
  In this paper, we show that any optimal dynamic auction is a virtual welfare
maximizer subject to some monotone allocation constraints. In particular, the
explicit definition of the virtual value function above arises naturally from
the primal-dual analysis by relaxing the monotone constraints. We further
develop an ironing technique that gets rid of the monotone allocation
constraints. Quite different from Myerson's ironing approach, our technique is
more technically involved due to the interdependence of the virtual value
functions across buyers. We nevertheless show that ironing can be done
approximately and efficiently, which in turn leads to a Fully Polynomial Time
Approximation Scheme of the optimal dynamic auction.

Melosh spin rotation effects in diffractive electroproduction of S-wave heavy
quarkonia off a nucleon target. Such a study has been performed within the
color dipole approach using, as an example and a reference point, two popular
parametrizations of the dipole cross section and two potentials describing the
interaction between Q and bar{Q} and entering in the Schroedinger equation
based formalism for determination of the quarkonia wave functions. We find a
strong onset of spin rotation effects in 1S charmonium photoproduction which is
obviously neglected in present calculations of corresponding cross sections.
For photoproduction of radially excited Psi'(2S) these effects are even
stronger leading to an increase of the photoproduction cross section by a
factor of 2-3 depending on the photon energy. Even in production of radially
excited Y'(2S) and Y""(3S) they can not be neglected and cause the 20-30%
enhancement of the photoproduction cross section. Finally, we predict that the
spin effects vanish gradually with photon virtuality Q^2 following universality
properties in production of different heavy quarkonia as a function of Q^2 +
M_V^2.

entanglement of the aperiodic discrete-time quantum walks. The aperiodicity is
described by spatially dependent quantum coins distributed on the lattice,
whose distribution is neither periodic (Bloch-like) nor random (Anderson-like).
Within transport properties we identified delocalized/localized quantum walks
mediated by a proper adjusting of aperiodic parameter. Both scenarios are
studied by exploring typical quantities (inverse participation ratio and
survival probability), as well as the energy spectra of an associated effective
Hamiltonian. By using the energy spectra analysis, we show that the early stage
the inhomogeneity leads to vanishing gap between two main bands, which
justifies the the delocalized character observed for $\nu<0.5$. With increase
of $\nu$ arises gaps and flat-bands on the energy spectra, which corroborates
the suppresion of transport detected for $\nu>0.5$. For $\nu$ high enough we
observe an energy spectra which resembles that described by the 1d Anderson
model. Within coin-position entanglement, we show many settings in which an
enhancement in the ability to entangle is observed. This behavior brings new
informations about the role played by aperiodicity on the coin-poisition
entanglement for static inhomogeneous systems, reported before as almost always
reducing the entanglement when comparing with the homogeneous case. We extend
the analysis in order to show that systems with static inhomogeneity are able
to exhibit asymptotic limit of entanglement.

  The present contribution has been performed as a part of efforts to reduce
the amount of greenhouse gases used in high energy experiments. The performance
of MRPC has been measured with two different gas mixtures; $\rm C_2F_4H_2$
based gas mixtures and the ecological $\rm C_3F_4H_2$ (HFO-1234ze). A small
MRPC was used for the tests. It has an sensitive area of 20 $\times$ 20 $\rm

  In normal operation, the strong space charge created within the gas avalanche
limits the avalanche's growth. $\rm SF_6$ plays an important part in the
process due to its high attachment coefficient at low electric fields. It is
thus necessary to find another gas that has a similar attachment coefficient.
$\rm CF_{3}I$ is a possible candidate. Tests were performed with this gas added

operations management. Unlike a road network, the freight flow assignment
pattern in a rail system has unique characteristics, and the most significant
one is the tree-shaped path. More specifically, when two or more shipments
arrive at a rail yard, those intended for the same destination will be treated
as a single freight flow and be shipped through the same path during the
remainder of the trip, regardless of their origins. This paper reveals the
forming mechanism of the tree-shaped path from the perspective of rail yard
operations, and develops a nonlinear programming model for the RFFA problem.
Considering the notably large number of quadratic terms generated from the
tree-shaped constraints, the model is difficult to solve even for small-size
instances. We thus introduce binary decision variables and modify the model
into a nonlinear binary programming problem. In order to solve large-scale RFFA
problems, we outline a simulated annealing algorithm.

phases: gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), bassanite (CaSO4.0.5H2O), and anhydrite (CaSO4).
Due to its relevance in natural and industrial processes, the formation
pathways of these calcium sulphate phases from aqueous solution have been the
subject of intensive research. There is a growing body of literature, that
calcium sulfate forms essentially through a non-classical nanoparticle- or
cluster-mediated crystallisation process. At the early stages of precipitation
calcium sulfate crystals grow through the reorganization and coalescence of
aggregates rather than through classical unit addition. Here, we show by using
low-dose dark field (DF) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron
diffraction, that these re-structuring processes by no means continue until a
near-perfectly homogeneous single crystal is obtained. Instead the growth
process yields a final imperfect mesocrystal of the overall morphology
resembling that of a single crystal, yet composed of smaller nano-domains.
Hence, our data indicate that organic-free mesocrystal grown by a particle
mediated-pathway may preserve a 'memory or 'imprint' of the non-classical
growth process in the final crystal structure, something that has been largely
overlooked until now. Furthermore, the nano-scale misalignment of the
structural sub-units within crystals might propagate through the length-scales,
and potentially is expressed macroscopically as misaligned zones/domains in
large single crystals, e.g. as those observed in some of the giant crystals
from the Naica Mine, Chihuahua, Mexico.

rather efficient and easy. The scheme combines two building blocks (a monotone

that allow to detect the regularity of the approximate solution adapting the

confirm the accuracy of the proposed method and the advantages given by the new

in-plane wavelengths compared with light in free space. As interesting as this
may look from both fundamental and applied viewpoints, such large confinement
is accompanied by poor in/out optical coupling, which severely limits the
application of polaritons in practical devices. Here, we quantify the coupling
strength between light and 2D polaritons in both homogeneous and anisotropic

universal expressions for the cross sections associated with photon-polariton
coupling by point and line defects, as well as with polariton extinction and
scattering processes. Additionally, we find closed-form constraints that limit
the maximum possible values of these cross sections. Specifically, the maximum
photon-to-plasmon conversion efficiency in graphene is $\sim10^{-6}$ and
$\sim10^{-4}$ for point and line scatterers sitting at its surface,
respectively, when the plasmon and photon energies are comparable in magnitude.
We further show that Mie resonators placed at an optimum distance from the film
can boost light-to-polariton coupling to order unity. Our results bear
fundamental interest for the development of 2D polaritonics and the design of

well-established influence functional path integral method, by going beyond
reduced system dynamics to provide the cumulant generating function of heat
exchange. The method is straightforward; we implement it for the nonequilibrium
spin boson model to calculate transient and long-time observables, focusing on
the steady-state heat current flowing through the system under a temperature
difference. Results are compared to perturbative treatments and demonstrate
good agreement in the appropriate limits. The challenge of converging
nonequilibrium quantities, currents and high order cumulants, is discussed in
detail. The iFCSPI, a numerically exact technique, naturally captures strong
system-bath coupling and non-Markovian effects of the environment. As such, it
is a promising tool for probing fundamental questions in quantum transport and

Transmission System Operators (TSO). The French TSO, RTE, is developing levers
to control power flows in real-time: renewable production curtailment is
already employed and large battery storage systems are planned to be installed
for congestion management in early 2020. The combination of these levers with
the use of Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) helps exploiting the lines at the closest
of their limit by managing their temperature in real-time. Unnecessary margins
can be reduced, avoiding congestion and excessive generation curtailment. In
particular, there is a possible interesting correlation between the transits
increase due to high wind farms generation and the cooling effect of wind on
power lines in the same area. In order to optimize the electrical transmission
network capacities, the present paper advocates the use of a temperature
management model, mixing production curtailment and large batteries as control

small compared to the horizontal length scale of the reservoir. For this
reason, wells are typically modelled as lower-dimensional sources. In this
work, we consider a coupled 1D-3D flow model, in which the well is modelled as
a line source in the reservoir domain and endowed with its own 1D flow
equation. The flow between well and reservoir can then be modelled in a fully
coupled manner by applying a linear filtration law.
  The line source induces a logarithmic type singularity in the reservoir
pressure that is difficult to resolve numerically. We present here a
singularity removal method for the model equations, resulting in a reformulated
coupled 1D-3D flow model in which all variables are smooth. The singularity
removal is based on a solution splitting of the reservoir pressure, where it is
decomposed into two terms: an explicitly given, lower regularity term capturing
the solution singularity and some smooth background pressure. The singularities
can then be removed from the system by subtracting them from the governing
equations. Finally, the coupled 1D-3D flow equations can be reformulated so
they are given in terms of the well pressure and the background reservoir
pressure. As these variables are both smooth (i.e. non-singular), the
reformulated model has the advantage that it can be approximated using any
standard numerical method. The reformulation itself resembles a Peaceman well
correction performed at the continuous level.

equation, which we refer to as~SSE$_\rho$, applied to many-body systems with
symmetries. For a nondegenerate energy level, the solution $\rho$ of the
SSE$_\rho$ is merely a projection on the corresponding eigenvector. However, in
the case of degeneracy $\rho$ is non-unique and not necessarily pure. In fact,
it can be an arbitrary mixture of the degenerate pure eigenstates. Importantly,
$\rho$ can always be chosen to respect all symmetries of the Hamiltonian, even
if each pure eigenstate in the corresponding degenerate multiplet spontaneously
breaks the symmetries. This and other features of the solutions of the
SSE$_\rho$ can prove helpful by easing the notations and providing an
unobscured insight into the structure of the eigenstates. We work out the
SSE$_\rho$ for a general system of spins $1/2$ with Heisenberg interactions,
and address simple systems of spins $1$. Eigenvalue problem for quantum
observables other than Hamiltonian can also be formulated in terms of density
matrices. As an illustration, we provide an analytical solution to the
eigenproblem ${\bf S}^2 \rho=S(S+1) \rho$, where $\bf S$ is the total spin of

mass eruptions. The yellow hypergiant Rho Cas is famous for its historical and
recent outbursts, during which the star develops a cool, optically thick wind
with a very brief but high mass-loss rate, causing a sudden drop in the light
curve. Here we report on a new outburst of Rho Cas which occurred in 2013,
accompanied by a temperature decrease of ~3000 K and a brightness drop of 0.6
mag. During the outburst TiO bands appear, together with many low excitation
metallic atmospheric lines characteristic for a later spectral type. With this

in response to external stimulation. In order to detect and evaluate an ERP in
an ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG), it is necessary to tag the EEG with the
exact onset time of the stimulus. We define the latency as the delay between
the time the tagging command is sent and the detection of the stimulus on the
screen. Failing to control sequencing in the tagging pipeline causes problems
when interpreting latency, in particular when comparing ERPs generated from
stimuli displayed by different systems. In this work, we present number of
technical aspects which can influence latency such as the refresh rate of the
screen or the display of a stimulus at different screen location. A few
propositions are suggested to estimate and correct this latency.

duality for some spaces with singularities, as pseudomanifolds. But, with
coefficients in a ring, the behaviours of manifolds and pseudomanifolds are
different. This work is an overview, with proofs and explicit examples, of
various possible situations with their properties.
  We first set up a duality, defined from a cap product, between two
intersection cohomologies: the first one arises from a linear dual and the
second one from a simplicial blow up. Moreover, from this property, Poincar\'e
duality in intersection homology looks like the Poincar\'e-Lefschetz duality of
a manifold with boundary. Besides that, an investigation of the coincidence of
the two previous cohomologies reveals that the only obstruction to the
existence of a Poincar\'e duality is the homology of a well defined complex.
This recovers the case of the peripheral sheaf introduced by Goresky and Siegel
for compact PL-pseudomanifolds. We also list a series of explicit computations
of peripheral intersection cohomology. In particular, we observe that
Poincar\'e duality can exist in the presence of torsion in the ""critical

pre-explosion images taken with the HST WFPC2, we find that the SN position
coincides with a luminous and blue point-like source, with an
extinction-corrected absolute magnitude of M$_V$$\sim$$-$8.2 mag and
M$_I$$\sim$$-$7.7 mag.Comparisons of the observations to the theoretical models
indicate that the counterpart source was either a single WR star or a binary

further distinguish between different scenarios requires revisiting the site of
the progenitor with HST after the SN fades away.

to find these vulnerabilities so that after identifying ways to penetrate the

countermeasures. SVM is one of the major algorithms for intrusion detection. In
this research, we studied a variety of malware and methods of intrusion
detection, provide an efficient method for detecting attacks and utilizing
dimension reduction.Thus, we will be able to detect attacks by carefully
combining these two algorithms and pre-processes that are performed before the
two on the input data. The main question raised is how we can identify attacks
on computer networks with the above-mentioned method. In anomalies diagnostic
method, by identifying behavior as a normal behavior for the user, the host, or
the whole system, any deviation from this behavior is considered as an abnormal
behavior, which can be a potential occurrence of an attack. The network
intrusion detection system is used by anomaly detection method that uses the
SVM algorithm for classification and SVD to reduce the size. Steps of the
proposed method include pre-processing of the data set, feature selection,
support vector machine, and evaluation.The NSL-KDD data set has been used to
teach and test the proposed model. In this study, we inferred the intrusion

background gauge potential of the electromagnetic U(1) field. The Hall
conductance is given by the quantized prefactor of the CS term, which is a
momentum-space topological invariant. Here, we show that three-dimensional
crystalline topological insulators with no other symmetries are described by a
topological (3+1)-dimensional [3+1d] mixed CS term. In addition to the
electromagnetic U(1) gauge field, this term contains elasticity tetrad fields
$E^{\ a}_{\mu}({\bf r},t) = \partial_{\mu}X^a(\mathbf{r},t)$ which are
gradients of crystalline U(1) phase fields $X^a(\mathbf{r},t)$ and describe the
deformations of the crystal. For a crystal in three spatial dimensions
$a=1,2,3$ and the mixed axial-gravitational response contains three parameters
protected by crystalline symmetries: the weak momentum-space topological
invariants. The response of the Hall conductance to the deformations of the
crystal is quantized in terms of these invariants. In the presence of
dislocations, the anomalous 3+1d CS term describes the Callan-Harvey anomaly
inflow mechanism. The response can be extended to all odd spatial dimensions.
The elasticity tetrads, being the gradients of the lattice U(1) fields, have

manuscripts when writing a paper or simply to keep up with current research. In
this paper, we consider the problem of citation recommendation on graph and
propose a task-specific neighborhood construction strategy to learn the
distributed representations of papers. In addition, given the learned
representations, we investigate various schemes to rank the candidate papers
for citation recommendation. The experimental results show our proposed
neighborhood construction strategy outperforms the widely-used random walks
based sampling strategy on all ranking schemes, and the model based ranking
scheme outperforms embedding based rankings for both neighborhood construction
strategies. We also demonstrated that graph embedding is a robust approach for
citation recommendation when hidden ratio changes, while the performance of
classic methods drop significantly when the set of seed papers is becoming
small.

completeness of Peter-Weyl orthonormal basis as constructed from the matrix
coefficients of a maximal set of irreducible unitary representations of the
group, leading ultimately to the direct sum decomposition of its $L^{2}-$
space. A Peter-Weyl theory for a semicomplete orthonormal set is also possible
and is here developed in this paper for compact groups. Existence of
semicomplete orthonormal sets on a compact group is proved by an explicit
construction of the standard Riemann-Lebesgue semicomplete orthonormal set.
This approach gives an insight into the role played by the $L^{2}-$ space of a
compact group, which is discovered to be just an example (indeed the largest
example for every semicomplete orthonormal set) of what is called a
prime-Parseval subspace, which we proved to be dense in the usual $L^{2}-$
space, serves as the natural domain of the Fourier transform and breaks up into
a direct-sum decomposition. This paper essentially gives the harmonic analysis
of the prime-Parseval subsapce of a compact group corresponding to any
semicomplete orthonormal set, with an introduction to what is expected for all
connected semisimple Lie groups through the notion of a $K-$semicomplete
orthonormal set.

without resorting to the full machinery of (higher-order) perturbation theory.

a conserved fully non-linear current $\zeta_\mu$, thereby allowing to directly
connect perturbations during inflation to late-Universe observables. We discus
some issues arising from the choice of the initial hyper-surface in the $\Delta

barotropic fluid, we find that it is not in general related to the standard

nuclear physics is the event reconstruction. Its main part is the track
reconstruction procedure which consists in looking for all tracks that
elementary particles leave when they pass through a detector among a huge
number of points, so-called hits, produced when flying particles fire detector
coordinate planes. Unfortunately, the tracking is seriously impeded by the
famous shortcoming of multiwired, strip in GEM detectors due to the appearance
in them a lot of fake hits caused by extra spurious crossings of fired strips.
Since the number of those fakes is several orders of magnitude greater than for
true hits, one faces with the quite serious difficulty to unravel possible
track-candidates via true hits ignoring fakes. On the basis of our previous
two-stage approach based on hits preprocessing using directed K-d tree search
followed by a deep neural classifier we introduce here two new tracking
algorithms. Both algorithms combine those two stages in one while using
different types of deep neural nets. We show that both proposed deep networks
do not require any special preprocessing stage, are more accurate, faster and
can be easier parallelized. Preliminary results of our new approaches for
simulated events are presented.

a ""hierarchy problem"" and that similarly the ""cosmological constant problem""
resolves itself if we understand the SM as a low energy effective theory
emerging from a cutoff-medium at the Planck scale. We actually take serious
Veltman's ""The Infrared - Ultraviolet Connection"" addressing the issue of
quadratic divergences and the related huge radiative correction predicted by
the SM in the relationship between the bare and the renormalized theory,
usually called ""the hierarchy problem"" and claimed that this has to be cured.
We discuss these issues under the condition of a stable Higgs vacuum, which
allows to extend the SM up to the Planck cutoff. The bare Higgs boson mass then
changes sign below the Planck scale, such that the SM in the early universe is
in the symmetric phase. The cutoff enhanced Higgs mass term as well as the
quartically enhanced cosmological constant term provide a large positive dark
energy which triggers the inflation of the early universe. Reheating follows
via the decays of the four unstable heavy Higgs particles, predominantly into
top-antitop pairs, which at this stage are still massless. Preheating is
suppressed in SM inflation since in the symmetric phase bosonic decay channels
are absent at tree level. The coefficients of the shift between bare and
renormalized Higgs mass as well as of the shift between bare and renormalized
vacuum energy density exhibit close-by zeros at about $7.7 \times 10^{14}$ GeV
and $3.1 \times 10^{15}$ GeV, respectively. The zero of of the Higgs mass
counter term triggers the electroweak phase transition from the low energy
Higgs phase and to the symmetric phase above the transition point. The scenario
highly favors to understand the SM and its main properties as a natural
structure emerging at long distance.

and is used to identify sleep disorders. In sleep medicine, clinicians
interpret raw EEG signals in so-called sleep stages, which are assigned by
experts to every 30s window of signal. For diagnosis, they also rely on shorter
prototypical micro-architecture events which exhibit variable durations and
shapes, such as spindles, K-complexes or arousals. Annotating such events is
traditionally performed by a trained sleep expert, making the process time
consuming, tedious and subject to inter-scorer variability. To automate this
procedure, various methods have been developed, yet these are event-specific
and rely on the extraction of hand-crafted features.
  New method: We propose a novel deep learning architecure called Dreem One
Shot Event Detector (DOSED). DOSED jointly predicts locations, durations and
types of events in EEG time series. The proposed approach, applied here on
sleep related micro-architecture events, is inspired by object detectors
developed for computer vision such as YOLO and SSD. It relies on a
convolutional neural network that builds a feature representation from raw EEG
signals, as well as two modules performing localization and classification
respectively.
  Results and comparison with other methods: The proposed approach is tested on
4 datasets and 3 types of events (spindles, K-complexes, arousals) and compared
to the current state-of-the-art detection algorithms.
  Conclusions: Results demonstrate the versatility of this new approach and
improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art detection
methods.

large-capacity data communications via encoding the information on orthogonal
guiding modes. However, the on-chip routing of a multimode waveguide occupies
too large chip area due to the constraints on inter-mode cross talk and mode
leakage. Very recently, many efforts have been made to shrink the footprint of
individual element like bending and crossing, but the devices still occupy
>10x10 um2 footprint for three-mode multiplexed signals and the high-speed
signal transmission has not been demonstrated yet. In this work, we demonstrate
the first MDM circuits based on digitized meta-structures which have extremely
compact footprints. The radius for a three-mode bending is only 3.9 {\mu}m and
the footprint of a crossing is only 8x8um2. The 3x100 Gbit/s mode-multiplexed
signals are arbitrarily routed through the circuits consists of many sharp
bends and compact crossing with a bit error rate under forward error correction
limit. This work is a significant step towards the large-scale and dense
integration of MDM photonic integrated circuits.

asynchronously report per-pixel intensity changes rather than outputting an
actual intensity image at regular intervals. This new paradigm of image sensor
offers significant potential advantages; namely, sparse and non-redundant data
representation. Unfortunately, however, most of the existing artificial neural
network architectures, such as a CNN, require dense synchronous input data, and
therefore, cannot make use of the sparseness of the data. We propose EventNet,
a neural network designed for real-time processing of asynchronous event
streams in a recursive and event-wise manner. EventNet models dependence of the
output on tens of thousands of causal events recursively using a novel temporal
coding scheme. As a result, at inference time, our network operates in an
event-wise manner that is realized with very few sum-of-the-product
operations---look-up table and temporal feature aggregation---which enables
processing of 1 mega or more events per second on standard CPU. In experiments
using real data, we demonstrated the real-time performance and robustness of
our framework.

task. Indeed, human process is usually a natural categorization that underlies
many natural abilities such as image recovery, language comprehension, decision
making, or pattern recognition. In the image search axis, there are several
ways to measure the similarity between images in an image database, to a query
image. Image search by content is based on the similarity of the visual
characteristics of the images. The distance function used to evaluate the
similarity between images depends on the criteria of the search but also on the
representation of the characteristics of the image; this is the main idea of
the near and fuzzy sets approaches. In this article, we introduce a new
category of beta type-2 fuzzy sets for the description of image characteristics
as well as the near sets approach for image recovery. Finally, we illustrate
our work with examples of image recovery problems used in the real world.

provide discriminative information and reduce the computational burden of the
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, the DR methods face many
challenges due to limited training samples with high dimensional spectra. To
address this issue, a graph-based spatial and spectral regularized local
scaling cut (SSRLSC) for DR of HSI data is proposed. The underlying idea of the
proposed method is to utilize the information from both the spectral and
spatial domains to achieve better classification accuracy than its spectral
domain counterpart. In SSRLSC, a guided filter is initially used to smoothen
and homogenize the pixels of the HSI data in order to preserve the pixel
consistency. This is followed by generation of between-class and within-class
dissimilarity matrices in both spectral and spatial domains by regularized
local scaling cut (RLSC) and neighboring pixel local scaling cut (NPLSC)
respectively. Finally, we obtain the projection matrix by optimizing the
updated spatial-spectral between-class and total-class dissimilarity. The
effectiveness of the proposed DR algorithm is illustrated with two popular
real-world HSI datasets.

research papers focus their attention on the quality aspects of wireless links.
  The analysis of the rich body of existing literature on link quality
estimation using models developed from data traces indicates that the
techniques used for modeling link quality estimation are becoming increasingly
sophisticated. A number of recent estimators leverage machine learning (ML)
techniques that require a sophisticated design and development process, each of
which has a great potential to significantly affect the overall model
performance.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on link quality estimators
developed from empirical data and then focus on the subset that use ML
algorithms. We analyze ML-based link quality estimation (LQE) models from two
perspectives using performance data. Firstly, we focus on how they address
quality requirements that are important from the perspective of the
applications they serve. Secondly, we analyze how they approach the standard
design steps commonly used in the ML community. Having analyzed the scientific
body of the survey, we review existing open source datasets suitable for LQE
research. Finally, we round up our survey with the lessons learned and design
guidelines for ML-based LQE development and dataset collection.

benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and
robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility
due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However,
I suggest that progress towards this goal might be accelerated by working
towards an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More
specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of
entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of
non-neuronal insect physiology to make ""virtual insects."" I argue that this
could be realistically achievable within the next 20 years. I propose that
developing emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of
scientists, businesspeople, and policymakers towards pursuing the loftier goal
of emulating the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE,
simulating mammalian brains and eventually the human brain may no longer be
viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve substantial funding and resources.
Furthermore, IBE will facilitate dramatic advances in cognitive neuroscience,
artificial intelligence, and robotics through studies performed using virtual
insects.
