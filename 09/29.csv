the decays of non-hadronic electrically neutral long-lived particles (LLPs)
with almost no background or trigger limitations. This would allow MATHUSLA to
probe sub-GeV to TeV masses and lifetimes up to $c\tau \sim 10^7~{\rm m}$.
MATHUSLA can play an important role in probing dark-matter scenarios involving
extended hidden sectors, where additional dark states often manifest as LLPs. A
prime example of such a scenario is furnished by the Dynamical Dark Matter
(DDM) framework, which intrinsically gives rise to large ensembles of dark
states exhibiting a broad range of masses and lifetimes. In this paper, we
examine the extent to which MATHUSLA can probe the DDM parameter space, and we
demonstrate that MATHUSLA may be capable of providing direct confirmation of
certain unique aspects of the DDM framework which might be difficult to probe
in other ways.

magnetism are in high demand for nanoelectronics and spintronic applications.
Herein, we predict a novel two-dimensional monolayer KTlO that possesses an
indirect band gap of 2.25 eV (based on HSE06) and high carrier mobility (1860
$\mathrm{cm^2\ V^{-1}s^{-1}}$ for electron and 2540 $\mathrm{cm^2\
V^{-1}s^{-1}}$ for hole) by means of ab initio calculations. KTlO monolayer has
a calculated cleavage energy of 0.56 $\mathrm{J\ m^{-2}}$, which suggests
exfoliation of bulk material as viable means for the preparation of mono- and
few-layer materials. Remarkably, the KTlO monolayer suggests tunable magnetism
and half-metallicity with hole doping, which are attributed to the novel
Mexican-hat-like bands and van Hove singularities in its electron structure.
Furthermore, monolayer KTlO exhibits moderate optical absorption over visible
light and ultraviolet region. The band gap value and band characteristics of
monolayer KTlO can be strongly manipulated by biaxial and uniaxial strains to
meet the requirements of various applications. All these novel properties
render monolayer KTlO a promising functional material for future
nanoelectronics and spintronic applications.

provide a multi wavelength catalogue of the counterparts of the radio sources
to be used in further studies. For the optical and NIR identification of the
radio sources, we used the likelihood ratio (LR) technique, slightly modified
in order to take into account the presence of a large number of relatively
bright counterparts close to the radio sources. This procedure led to the
identification of optical/NIR counterparts for 4770 different radio sources
(~77% of the whole radio sample), 414 of which also have an X-ray counterpart.
This fraction of identification is in agreement with previous radio-optical
association studies at a similar optical magnitude depth, but is relatively low
in comparison to recent work conducted in other radio fields using deeper
optical and NIR data. The analysis of optical and NIR properties of radio
sources shows that, regardless of the radio flux limit of a radio survey, the
nature of the identified sources is strongly dependent on the depth of the
optical/NIR used in the identification process. Only with deep enough
optical/NIR data will we be able to identify a significant fraction of radio
sources with red (z_{DEC}-K) counterparts whose radio emission is dominated by
nuclear activity rather than starburst activity.

eccentricity distributions of HIP41378~d \& f, finding that periods
$\lesssim$300 days require non-zero eccentricity. We also perform a stability
analysis on the orbits of planets d and f to assess the likelihood of their
different possible periods, finding that short periods (P $<$ 300 days) are
disfavored. In addition, we observe transits of the inner two planets b and c

for achieving quantum information processing(QIP) tasks has been gaining
increasing significance. In this context, a particularly important
demonstration has been that non-vanishing discord is the necessary condition
for the separable states to be used as resource for remotely preparing any
arbitrary pure target state [Nature Physics $8$, $666$ $(2012)$]. The present
work stems from our observation that not only resource states with same discord
can imply different efficiencies (in terms of average fidelity) of the remote
state preparation (RSP) protocol, but also states with higher discord can imply
lower RSP efficiency. This, therefore, necessitates identification of the
relevant feature of quantum correlations which can appropriately quantify
effectiveness of the resource state for the RSP protocol. To this end, for the
two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, we show that an appropriate measure of
simultaneous correlations in three mutually unbiased bases can serve to
quantify usefulness of the resource for the RSP task using entangled as well as
separable states, including non-discordant states as resource. In particular,
it is revealed that zero-discord states having such non-vanishing measure can
be useful for remotely preparing a subset of pure target states. Thus, this
work shows that, using separable states, an effective resource for QIP tasks
such as RSP can be provided by simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased
bases.

  Super-Resolution","14 pages,14 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of single image super-resolution has achieved significant
improvement by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The
features in deep CNN contain different types of information which make
different contributions to image reconstruction. However, most CNN-based models
lack discriminative ability for different types of information and deal with
them equally, which results in the representational capacity of the models
being limited. On the other hand, as the depth of neural networks grows, the
long-term information coming from preceding layers is easy to be weaken or lost
in late layers, which is adverse to super-resolving image. To capture more
informative features and maintain long-term information for image
super-resolution, we propose a channel-wise and spatial feature modulation
(CSFM) network in which a sequence of feature-modulation memory (FMM) modules
is cascaded with a densely connected structure to transform low-resolution
features to high informative features. In each FMM module, we construct a set
of channel-wise and spatial attention residual (CSAR) blocks and stack them in
a chain structure to dynamically modulate multi-level features in a
global-and-local manner. This feature modulation strategy enables the high
contribution information to be enhanced and the redundant information to be
suppressed. Meanwhile, for long-term information persistence, a gated fusion
(GF) node is attached at the end of the FMM module to adaptively fuse
hierarchical features and distill more effective information via the dense skip
connections and the gating mechanism. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on benchmark datasets illustrate the superiority of our proposed
method over the state-of-the-art methods.

distribution is not typically known when the dynamics breaks detailed balance.
Here, we derive a generic importance sampling technique that leverages the
statistical power of configurations transported by nonequilibrium trajectories,
and can be used to compute averages with respect to arbitrary target
distributions. As a dissipative reweighting scheme, the method can be viewed in
relation to the annealed importance sampling (AIS) method and the related
Jarzynski equality. Unlike AIS, our approach gives an unbiased estimator, with
provably lower variance than directly estimating the average of an observable.
We also establish a direct relation between a dynamical quantity, the
dissipation, and the volume of phase space, from which we can compute
quantities such as the density of states and Bayes factors. We illustrate the
properties of estimators relying on this sampling technique in the context of
density of state calculations, showing that it scales favorable with
dimensionality -- in particular, we show that it can be used to compute the
phase diagram of the mean-field Ising model from a single nonequilibrium
trajectory. We also demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the approach
with an application to a Bayesian model comparison problem of the type
encountered in astrophysics and machine learning.

becomes extremely large, which may be useful in aiding geoengineering

consider evaluations of selfadjoint noncommutative polynomials in

For the first time in this generality, it is shown that the analytic
distributions of those evaluations have H\""older continuous cumulative

the degree of the considered polynomial. For linear polynomials, we reach in
the case of finite non-microstates free Fisher information the optimal H\""older

conjugate variables. In particular, our results guarantee that such polynomial
evaluations have finite logarithmic energy and thus finite (non-microstates)
free entropy, which partially settles a conjecture of Charlesworth and
Shlyakhtenko [CS16].
  We further provide a very general criterion that gives for weak
approximations of measures having H\""older continuous cumulative distribution
functions explicit rates of convergence in terms of the Kolmogorov distance.
  Finally, we combine these results to study the asymptotic eigenvalue
distributions of polynomials in GUEs or matrices with more general Gibbs laws.

convergence in distribution to convergence in Kolmogorov distance; in the GUE

size roughly $ g^r $, for $ g $ local groups and maximum or specified locality
$ r $. For equal localities, these global fields are smaller than those of
previous MR-LRCs when $ r \leq h $ (global parities). For unequal localities,

modulated by the rotation of the ferromagnetic moment. Combined with
measurements of Berry curvature induced Hall conductivity, we find that along

of the moment towards the kagome plane. These observations demonstrate that
strong coupling of magnetic order to electronic structure similar to that

efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In
addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up
convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to
dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations.
Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP
inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.

Another set of the Hilbert transforms in a semi-axis are deduced from integral

the Hubble Space Telescope. With the main objective of unveiling the nature of
galaxies up to $z \sim 7-8$, the observing and reduction strategy have focused
on the properties of small and unresolved objects, rather than the outskirts of
the largest objects, which are usually over-subtracted.
  We aim to create a new set of WFC3/IR mosaics of the HUDF using novel
techniques to preserve the properties of the low surface brightness regions. We
created ABYSS: a pipeline that optimises the estimate and modelling of
low-level systematic effects to obtain a robust background subtraction.
  We have improved four key points in the reduction: 1) creation of new
absolute sky flat fields, 2) extended persistence models, 3) dedicated sky
background subtraction and 4) robust co-adding. The new mosaics successfully
recover the low surface brightness structure removed on the previous HUDF
published reductions.
  The amount of light recovered with a mean surface brightness dimmer than
$\overline{\mu}=26$ mar arcsec$^{-2}$ is equivalent to a m=19 mag source when
compared to the XDF and a m=20 mag compared to the HUDF12. We present a set of
techniques to reduce ultra-deep images ($\mu>32.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, $3\sigma$
in $10\times10$ arcsec boxes), that successfully allow to detect the low
surface brightness structure of extended sources on ultra deep surveys. The
developed procedures are applicable to HST, JWST, EUCLID and many other space
and ground-based observatories. We will make the final ABYSS WFC3/IR HUDF

These can be the central parts of low mass $M_L \sim 10^3$--$10^6\,M_\odot$

challenging to observe. Neglecting finely-tuned impact parameters, we focus on
lenses aligned generally on the Einstein scale for which multiple lensed images
may not form in the case of an extended lens. In this case, diffraction induces
amplitude and phase modulations whose sizes $\sim 10\%$--$20\%$ are small
enough so that standard matched filtering with unlensed waveforms do not
degrade, but are still detectable for events with high signal-to-noise ratio.
We develop and test an agnostic detection method based on dynamic programming,

pseudo-Jaffe lenses aligned up to the Einstein radius, we demonstrate that a
pair of fully upgraded aLIGO/Virgo detectors can extract diffraction imprints

improve dramatically for a third-generation detector for which binary black

We use the TNG100 run and select galaxies at redshifts $z\le0.6$ with stellar
mass exceeding $10^{9.5}{\rm M_\odot}$ and with host halo masses of
$10^{13}-10^{14.6}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Among more than about 6000 (2600) galaxies
with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies by visually
inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections. About $31\%$
of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and
gaseous tails stemming from the main luminous bodies. This is a lower limit,
since the random orientation entails a loss of about $30\%$ of galaxies that in
an optimal projection would otherwise be identified as jellyfish. The
connection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of
findings: jellyfish galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large
cluster-centric distances ($r/R_{\rm 200c}\gtrsim 0.25$); they move through the
ICM with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster
population, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram
pressures. Furthermore, the gaseous tails usually extend in opposite directions
to the galaxy trajectory, with no relation between tail orientation and the
host's center. The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence
on redshift $(0\le z\le0.6)$ but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous
morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses.
Finally, jellyfish galaxies are late infallers ($< 2.5-3$ Gyrs ago, at $z=0$)
and the emergence of gaseous tails correlates well with the presence of bow
shocks in the ICM.

and study to which extent the modern high-statistics data sets can be described

a mass of the $\omega$ meson significantly lower than the current PDG average.
In addition to a complete treatment of statistical and systematic errors
propagated from the data, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the systematic
errors in the dispersive representation and derive the consequences for the
two-pion contribution to hadronic vacuum polarization. In a global fit to both

thus most stringent for low energies, we obtain uncertainty estimates

the corresponding contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. As
side products, we obtain improved constraints on the $\pi\pi$ $P$-wave,
valuable input for future global analyses of low-energy $\pi\pi$ scattering, as

hard bands, namely H1 (8-16 keV), H2 (16-24 keV) and VH (35-55 keV). The
aggregated area of the surveys is $\sim 2.7$ deg$^2$. While a large number of
sources is detected in the H1 band (72 at the $97\%$ level of reliability), the
H2 band directly probing close to the peak of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB)
returns four significant detections, and two tentative, although not
significant, detections are found in the VH band. All the sources detected
above 16 keV are also detected at lower energies. We compute the integral
number counts for sources in such bands, which show broad consistency with
population synthesis models of the CXB. We furthermore identify two
Compton-thick AGNs, one in the COSMOS field, associated with a hard and faint
Chandra source, and one in the UDS field, never detected in the X-ray band
before. Both sources are at the same redshift $z \sim 1.25$, which shifts their
Compton-hump into the H1 band, and were previously missed in the usually
employed NuSTAR bands, confirming the potential of using the H1 band to
discover obscured AGNs at $z > 1$ in deep surveys.

Supernova (ASAS-SN) Bright Supernova Catalogs to determine the observed
relative Type Ia supernova (SN) rates as a function of luminosity and host
galaxy properties. We find that the luminosity distribution of the SNe Ia in
our sample is reasonably well described by a Schechter function with a
faint-end slope $\alpha \approx 1.5$ and a knee $M_{\star} \approx -18.0$. Our
specific SN Ia rates are consistent with previous results but extend to far
lower host galaxy masses. We find an overall rate that scales as
$(M_{\star}/10^{10} M_{\odot})^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx -0.5$. This shows
that the specific SN Ia rate continues rising towards lower masses even in
galaxies as small as $\log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) \lesssim 7.0$, where it is
enhanced by a factor of $\sim10-20$ relative to host galaxies with stellar
masses $\sim10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We find no strong dependence of the specific SN
Ia rate on the star formation activity of the host galaxies, but additional
observations are required to improve the constraints on the star formation
rates.

dimensions. Using the X-cube model as our motivating example, we give a
conjecture, with partial proof, of the conditions for a boundary to be gapped.
In order to state our conjecture, we use a precise definition of fracton
braiding and show that bulk braiding of fractons has several features that make
it \textit{insufficient} to classify gapped boundaries. Most notable among
these is that bulk braiding is sensitive to geometry and is ""nonreciprocal,""
that is, braiding an excitation $a$ around $b$ need not yield the same phase as
braiding $b$ around $a$. Instead, we define fractonic ""boundary braiding,""
which resolves these difficulties in the presence of a boundary. We then
conjecture that a boundary of an Abelian fracton system is gapped if and only
if a ""boundary Lagrangian subgroup"" of excitations is condensed at the
boundary, this is a generalization of the condition for a gapped boundary in
two spatial dimensions, but it relies on boundary braiding instead of bulk
braiding. We also discuss the distinctness of gapped boundaries and transitions
between different topological orders on gapped boundaries.

They are beyond the strong gravitational influences of the known planets yet
close enough to the Sun that outside forces are minimal. Here we report the
discovery of the third known IOC after Sedna and 2012 VP113, called 2015 TG387.
2015 TG387 has a perihelion of $65 \pm 1$ au and semi-major axis of $1170 \pm
70$ au. The longitude of perihelion angle, $\bar{\omega}$, for 2015 TG387 is
between that of Sedna and 2012 VP113, and thus similar to the main group of
clustered extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs), which may be shepherded into
similar orbital angles by an unknown massive distant planet, called Planet X or
Planet Nine. 2015 TG387's orbit is stable over the age of the solar system from
the known planets and Galactic tide. When including outside stellar encounters
over 4 Gyrs, 2015 TG387's orbit is usually stable, but its dynamical evolution
depends on the stellar encounter scenarios used. Surprisingly, when including a
massive Planet X beyond a few hundred au on an eccentric orbit that is
anti-aligned in longitude of perihelion with most of the known ETNOs, we find
2015 TG387 is typically stable for Planet X orbits that render the other ETNOs
stable as well. Notably, 2015 TG387's argument of perihelion is constrained and
its longitude of perihelion librates about 180 degs from Planet X's longitude
of perihelion, keeping 2015 TG387 anti-aligned with Planet X over the age of
the solar system. We find a power law slope near 3 for the semi-major axis
distribution of IOCs, meaning there are many more high than low semi-major axis
IOCs. There are about 2 million IOCs larger than 40 km, giving a mass of
$10^{22}$ kg. The IOCs inclination distribution is similar to the scattered
disk, with an average inclination of 19 degs.

detected in a high-extinction field, very close to the Galactic plane. Due to
the dust extinction along the line of sight, this event was too faint to be
detected before it reached the peak of magnification. The microlensing
light-curve models indicate a high-magnification event with a maximum of
$A_\mathrm{max}\gtrsim200$, very sensitive to planetary deviations. An anomaly
in the light curve has been densely observed by the microlensing surveys MOA,
KMTNet, and OGLE. From the light-curve modeling, we find a planetary anomaly
characterized by a planet-to-host mass ratio,
$q=\left(1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\right)\times 10^{-4}$, at the peak recently
identified in the mass-ratio function of microlensing planets. Thus, this event
is interesting to include in future statistical studies about planet
demography. We have explored the possible degeneracies and find two competing
planetary models resulting from the $s\leftrightarrow1/s$ degeneracy. However,
because the projected separation is very close to $s=1$, the physical
implications for the planet for the two solutions are quite similar, except for
the value of $s$. By combining the light-curve parameters with a Galactic
model, we have estimated the planet mass
$M_2=17.9^{+9.6}_{-8.8}\,\mathrm{M}_\oplus$ and the lens distance
$D_\mathrm{L}=6.7^{+1.0}_{-1.3}\,\mathrm{kpc}$, corresponding to a Neptune-mass
planet close to the Galactic bulge. Such events with a low absolute latitude
($|b|\approx 1.1\,\mathrm{deg}$) are subject to both high extinction and more
uncertain source distances, two factors that may affect the mass measurements
in the provisional Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope fields. More events are
needed to investigate the potential trade-off between the higher lensing rate
and the difficulty in measuring masses in these low-latitude fields.

for the intracluster medium (ICM): (i) pure turbulence runs without radiative

balance. For pure turbulence runs in the subsonic regime, the rms density and
surface brightness (SB) fluctuations vary as the square of the rms Mach number
($\mathcal{M}_{\text{rms}}$). However, with thermal balance, the density and SB
fluctuations $(\delta SB/SB)$ are much larger. These scalings have implications
for translating SB fluctuations into a turbulent velocity, particularly for
cool cores. For thermal balance runs with large (cluster core) scale driving,
both the hot and cold phases of the gas are supersonic. For small scale (one
order of magnitude smaller than the cluster core) driving, multiphase gas forms
on a much longer timescale but $\mathcal{M}_{\text{rms}}$ is smaller. Both
small and large scale driving runs have velocities larger than the Hitomi
results from the Perseus cluster. Thus turbulent heating as the dominant
heating source in cool cluster cores is ruled out if multiphase gas is assumed
to condense out from the ICM. Next we perform thermal balance runs in which we
partition the input energy into thermal and turbulent parts and tune their
relative magnitudes. The contribution of turbulent heating has to be $\lesssim
10\%$ in order for turbulence velocities to match Hitomi observations. If the
dominant source of multiphase gas is not cooling from the ICM (but say uplift
from the central galaxy), the importance of turbulent heating cannot be
excluded.

INTEGRAL/ISGRI and SWIFT/BAT telescopes. This galaxy has a soft X-ray excess
that is typical for the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1. The question of the
origin of soft excess in such objects is still unclear. We tested and compared
two spectral models for the soft X-ray spectra based on the different physical
scenarios. The first one is based on the Done & Nayakshin model of two-phase
accretion disc in a vertical direction, which includes two reflection zones
with different ionization levels. According to this model, we found that a
highly ionized reflection has the value of ionization $\xi\sim3000$
$erg~s^{-1}~cm$ and is mostly responsible for the soft excess. This reflection
becomes comparable with a low ionized one ($\xi\sim30$ $erg~s^{-1}~cm$) in
moderate X-ray range. However, this model requires also an additional component
at soft energies with $kT\sim300$ eV. The second model is an energetically
self-consistent model and assumes that a soft excess arises from optically
thick thermal Comptonization of the disc emission. Combination of the UV (from
XMM/Optical monitor) and X-ray data in the latter model allowed us to determine
a mass of the central black hole of $6.9\times10^6 M_{\odot}$ and Eddington
ratio $log_{L/L_{Edd}}\simeq-0.57$. Also, we were not able to rule out one of
competing models using only X-ray spectra of NGC 4748.

attack in under 130 queries on a state-of-the-art face authentication system,
and under 100 queries on a host authentication system. We examine how these

comparison maps from the sheaf theoretic compactifications and prove their

making. Yet, efficiency gains from automation have come paired with concern for
algorithmic discrimination that can systematize inequality. Recent work has
proposed optimal post-processing methods that randomize classification
decisions for a fraction of individuals, in order to achieve fairness measures
related to parity in errors and calibration. These methods, however, have
raised concern due to the information inefficiency, intra-group unfairness, and
Pareto sub-optimality they entail. The present work proposes an alternative
active framework for fair classification, where, in deployment, a
decision-maker adaptively acquires information according to the needs of
different groups or individuals, towards balancing disparities in
classification performance. We propose two such methods, where information
collection is adapted to group- and individual-level needs respectively. We
show on real-world datasets that these can achieve: 1) calibration and single
error parity (e.g., equal opportunity); and 2) parity in both false positive
and false negative rates (i.e., equal odds). Moreover, we show that by
leveraging their additional degree of freedom, active approaches can
substantially outperform randomization-based classifiers previously considered
optimal, while avoiding limitations such as intra-group unfairness.

neighborhood is a mixture of stellar populations born in star-forming events
that occurred over the life-time of the thin disk of the Galaxy. Assuming stars
form in embedded clusters which have stellar initial mass functions (IMFs)
which depend on the metallicity and density of the star-forming gas clumps, the
integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) can be calculated. The shape of the IGIMF
thus depends on the SFR and metallicity. Here, the shape of the PDMF for stars
more massive than $1\,M_\odot$ in combination with the mass density in low-mass
stars is used to constrain the current star-formation rate (SFR), the star
formation history (SFH) and the current stellar plus remnant mass ($M_*$) in
the Galactic thin disk. This yields the current SFR, $\dot{M}_*=
4.1^{+3.1}_{-2.8}~M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, a declining SFH and
$M_*=2.1^{+3.0}_{-1.5}\times 10^{11}M_\odot$, respectively, with a V-band
stellar mass-to-light ratio of $M_*/L_V=2.79^{+0.48}_{-0.38}$.These values are
consistent with independent measurements. We also quantify the surface density
of black holes and neutron stars in the Galactic thin disk. The invariant
canonical IMF can reproduce the PDMF of the Galaxy as well as the IGIMF, but in
the universal IMF framework it is not possible to constrain any of the above
Galactic properties. Assuming the IGMF theory is the correct framework and in
combination with the vertical velocity dispersion data of stars, it follows
that the Milky Way would have appeared as a chain galaxy at high redshift.

using Post-Newtonian theory in three ways: first to provide an initial guess
for the initial momenta at 3.5PN order that implies low residual eccentricity,
second to measure the resulting eccentricity, and third to calculate
corrections to the momenta or initial separation which further reduce the
eccentricity. Regarding the initial guess, we compare numerical evolutions in
post-Newtonian theory to the post-circular and post-post-circular analytical
approximations to quasi-circular data. We discuss a robust fitting procedure to
measure eccentricity from numerical simulations using the orbital frequency,
and derive from the quasi-Keplerian parametrization at 1PN oder the correction
factors for the tangential and radial momentum components required to achieve
reduce the measured eccentricity to zero. We first test our procedure
integrating PN equations of motion at $3.5$PN where low eccentric initial data
is easily obtained, and then apply our method to sets of binary black hole
numerical relativity simulations with different mass ratios (q=1,2,...,8), spin
configurations and separations. Our set of simulations contains non-spinning,
spin-aligned and precessing simulations. We observe that the iterative
procedure produces low eccentric simulations with eccentricities of the order

obtain low eccentric NR simulations easily and saving computational resources.
Moreover, the analytical PN formulas derived in this paper will be useful to

treatment effects in longitudinal observational studies. Most existing works
assume that the data are collected at pre-fixed time points for all subjects,
which, however, is restrictive in practice. To deal with irregularly spaced
observations, we assume a class of continuous-time SNMMs and a martingale
condition of no unmeasured confounding (NUC) to identify the causal parameters.
We develop the first semiparametric efficiency theory and locally efficient
estimators for continuous-time SNMMs. This task is non-trivial due to the
restrictions from the NUC assumption imposed on the SNMM parameter. In the
presence of dependent censoring, we propose an inverse probability of censoring
weighting estimator, which achieves a multiple robustness feature in that it is
unbiased if either the model for the treatment process or the potential outcome

By subjecting a dilute system of frictional grains to a constant external shear

states: (i) steady state shear flow characterized by a constant deformation
rate, and (ii) shear arrest characterized by temporally decaying creep to a
statically stable state. The onset of arrest below critical shear stress occurs
at a time $t_{c}$ that exhibits a heavy-tailed distribution, whose mean and

option to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based
on the ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals
recorded using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor
cortices of the brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded
neurons requires repeated recalibrations of the interface, which can
potentially alter the day-to-day user experience. The resulting need for
continued user adaptation interferes with the natural, subconscious use of the
BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational approach that decodes movement
intent from a low-dimensional latent representation of the neural data. We
implement various domain adaptation methods to stabilize the interface over
significantly long times. This includes Canonical Correlation Analysis used to
align the latent variables across days; this method requires prior
point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains. Alternatively,
we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables across
days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These two
methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance of
the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain Adaptation
Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the
residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based
on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the
domain adaptation problem.

  Stabilization of Hybrid Aerial Vehicles","23 pages, 13 figures, preprint submitted to Elsevier Mechatronics",,,,"cs.SY cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the control design of an automatic crosswind
stabilization system for a novel, buoyantly-assisted aerial transportation
vehicle. This vehicle has several advantages over other aircraft including the
ability to take-off and land in very short distances and without the need for
roads or runways. Despite these advantages, the large surface area of the
vehicle's wing makes it more susceptible to wind, which introduces undesirable
roll angle motions. The role of the automatic crosswind stabilization system is
to detect the roll angle deviation, and then use motors at the wingtips to
counteract the wind effect. However, due to the relatively large inertia of the
wing compared to small-size unmanned aerial vehicles and additional input time
delays, an automatic crosswind stabilization system based on traditional
control algorithms such as the proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
controller results in a response time that is too slow. Another challenge is
the lack of high-accuracy wind sensors that can be mounted on the vehicle's
wing. Therefore, we first design a wind torque estimator that relies on
inertial measurements, and then use feed-forward compensation to directly
correct for the wind torque, resulting in a significantly faster response. We
second combine the proposed estimator with a model predictive controller (MPC),
and compare constrained MPC with unconstrained MPC for the considered
application. Experimental results show that our proposed estimation-based MPC
strategy reduces the response time of the system by around 80-90% compared to a
standard PID controller, without the need for adding wind sensors or changing
the hardware of the stabilization system.

error correction for the GKP code. We do this by examining the
maximum-likelihood problem for this setting and its mapping onto a 1D Euclidean
path-integral modeling a particle in a random cosine potential. We demonstrate
the efficiency of a minimum-energy decoding strategy as a proxy for the path
integral evaluation. In the second part of this paper, we analyze and
numerically assess the concatenation of the GKP code with the toric code. When
toric code measurements and GKP error correction measurements are perfect, we
find that by using GKP error information the toric code threshold improves from
$10\%$ to $14\%$. When only the GKP error correction measurements are perfect
we observe a threshold at $6\%$. In the more realistic setting when all error
information is noisy, we show how to represent the maximum likelihood decoding
problem for the toric-GKP code as a 3D compact QED model in the presence of a
quenched random gauge field, an extension of the random-plaquette gauge model
for the toric code. We present a new decoder for this problem which shows the
existence of a noise threshold at shift-error standard deviation $\sigma_0
\approx 0.243$ for toric code measurements, data errors and GKP ancilla errors.
If the errors only come from having imperfect GKP states, this corresponds to
states with just 4 photons or more. Our last result is a no-go result for
linear oscillator codes, encoding oscillators into oscillators. For the
Gaussian displacement error model, we prove that encoding corresponds to
squeezing the shift errors. This shows that linear oscillator codes are useless
for quantum information protection against Gaussian shift errors.

Nevertheless, both stacking orders can coexist within one flake, separated by a
strain soliton that can host topologically protected states. Clearly, accessing
the transport properties of the two stackings and the soliton is of high
interest. However, the stacking orders can transform into one another and
therefore, the seemingly trivial question how reliable electrical contact can

stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem where a learner sequentially
selects actions to maximize a reward which depends also on a user provided
per-round context. Though the context is chosen arbitrarily or adversarially,
the reward is assumed to be a stochastic function of a feature vector that
encodes the context and selected action. Our goal is to devise private learners
for the contextual linear bandit problem.
  We first show that using the standard definition of differential privacy
results in linear regret. So instead, we adopt the notion of joint differential
privacy, where we assume that the action chosen on day $t$ is only revealed to
user $t$ and thus needn't be kept private that day, only on following days. We
give a general scheme converting the classic linear-UCB algorithm into a joint
differentially private algorithm using the tree-based algorithm. We then apply
either Gaussian noise or Wishart noise to achieve joint-differentially private
algorithms and bound the resulting algorithms' regrets. In addition, we give
the first lower bound on the additional regret any private algorithms for the

applied to a broad spectrum of complex learning problems which were difficult
to solve using the traditional machine learning techniques in the past. In the
last few years, deep learning has advanced radically in such a way that it can
surpass human-level performance on a number of tasks. As a consequence, deep
learning is being extensively used in most of the recent day-to-day
applications. However, security of deep learning systems are vulnerable to
crafted adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but
can lead the model to misclassify the output. In recent times, different types
of adversaries based on their threat model leverage these vulnerabilities to
compromise a deep learning system where adversaries have high incentives.
Hence, it is extremely important to provide robustness to deep learning
algorithms against these adversaries. However, there are only a few strong
countermeasures which can be used in all types of attack scenarios to design a
robust deep learning system. In this paper, we attempt to provide a detailed
discussion on different types of adversarial attacks with various threat models

rapid pediatric body imaging with a scan time efficient 3D cones trajectory.
Methods: A residual convolutional neural network to correct off-resonance
artifacts (Off-ResNet) was trained with a prospective study of 30 pediatric
magnetic resonance angiography exams. Each exam acquired a short-readout scan
(1.18 ms +- 0.38) and a long-readout scan (3.35 ms +- 0.74) at 3T.
Short-readout scans, with longer scan times but negligible off-resonance
blurring, were used as reference images and augmented with additional
off-resonance for supervised training examples. Long-readout scans, with
greater off-resonance artifacts but shorter scan time, were corrected by
autofocus and Off-ResNet and compared to short-readout scans by normalized
root-mean-square error (NRMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scans were also compared by scoring on eight
anatomical features by two radiologists, using analysis of variance with
post-hoc Tukey's test. Reader agreement was determined with intraclass
correlation. Results: Long-readout scans were on average 59.3% shorter than
short-readout scans. Images from Off-ResNet had superior NRMSE, SSIM, and PSNR
compared to uncorrected images across +-1kHz off-resonance (P<0.01). The
proposed method had superior NRMSE over -677Hz to +1kHz and superior SSIM and
PSNR over +-1kHz compared to autofocus (P<0.01). Radiologic scoring
demonstrated that long-readout scans corrected with Off-ResNet were
non-inferior to short-readout scans (P<0.01). Conclusion: The proposed method
can correct off-resonance artifacts from rapid long-readout 3D cones scans to a
non-inferior image quality compared to diagnostically standard short-readout
scans.

These surprisingly large and sometimes rapid transitions challenge accepted
models of quasar physics and duty cycles, offer several new avenues for study
of quasar host galaxies, and open a wider interpretation of the cause of
differences between broad and narrow line AGN. To better characterize extreme
quasar variability, we present follow-up spectroscopy as part of a
comprehensive search for CLQs across the full SDSS footprint using
spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the SDSS DR7 catalog. Our primary
selection requires large-amplitude (|\Delta g|>1 mag, |\Delta r|>0.5 mag)
variability over any of the available time baselines probed by the SDSS and
Pan-STARRS 1 surveys. We employ photometry from the Catalina Sky Survey to
verify variability behavior in CLQ candidates where available, and confirm CLQs
using optical spectroscopy from the William Herschel, MMT, Magellan, and
Palomar telescopes. For our adopted S/N threshold on variability of broad
H\beta emission, we find 17 new CLQs, yielding a confirmation rate of >~ 20%.
These candidates are at lower Eddington ratio relative to the overall quasar
population which supports a disk-wind model for the broad line region. Based on

trajectories in autonomous vehicles. This approach is based on the use of a
cascade control where the external loop solves the position control using a
novel Takagi Sugeno - Model Predictive Control (TS-MPC) approach and the
internal loop is in charge of the dynamic control of the vehicle using a Takagi
Sugeno - Linear Quadratic Regulator technique designed via Linear Matrix
Inequalities (TS-LMI-LQR). Both techniques use a TS representation of the
kinematic and dynamic models of the vehicle. In addition, a novel Takagi Sugeno
estimator - Moving Horizon Estimator - Unknown Input Observer (TS-MHE-UIO) is
presented. This method estimates the dynamic states of the vehicle optimally as
well as the force of friction acting on the vehicle that is used to reduce the
control efforts. The innovative contribution of the TS-MPC and TS-MHE-UIO
techniques is that using the TS model formulation of the vehicle allows us to
solve the nonlinear problem as if it were linear, reducing computation times by
40-50 times. To demonstrate the potential of the TS-MPC we propose a comparison
between three methods of solving the kinematic control problem: using the
non-linear MPC formulation (NL-MPC), using TS-MPC without updating the
prediction model and using updated TS-MPC with the references of the planner.

feedback controllers for nonlinear control systems using the Koopman operator
framework. The Koopman operator approach provides a linear representation for a
nonlinear dynamical system and a bilinear representation for a nonlinear
control system. The problem of feedback stabilization of a nonlinear control
system is then transformed to the stabilization of a bilinear control system.
We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF)-based approach for the design of
stabilizing feedback controllers for the bilinear system. The search for
finding a CLF for the bilinear control system is formulated as a convex
optimization problem. This leads to a schematic procedure for designing
CLF-based stabilizing feedback controllers for the bilinear system and hence
the original nonlinear system. Another advantage of the proposed controller
design approach outlined in this paper is that it does not require explicit
knowledge of system dynamics. In particular, the bilinear representation of a
nonlinear control system in the Koopman eigenfunction space can be obtained
from time-series data. Simulation results are presented to verify the main
results on the design of stabilizing feedback controllers and the data-driven
aspect of the proposed approach.

DenseNets also face overfitting problem if not severer. Existing dropout method
can be applied but not as effective due to the introduced nonlinear

impeded, and the dropout effect will be weakened by the spatial correlation
inside feature maps. To address these problems, we craft the design of a
specialized dropout method from three aspects, dropout location, dropout
granularity, and dropout probability. The insights attained here could
potentially be applied as a general approach for boosting the accuracy of other

security challenges, cyber-infrastructures require active defense techniques
that incorporate cyber deception, in which the defender (deceiver) implements a
strategy to mislead the infiltrator. To this end, we use a two-player partially
observable stochastic game (POSG) framework, wherein the deceiver has full
observability over the states of the POSG, and the infiltrator has partial
observability. Then, the deception problem is to compute a strategy for the
deceiver that minimizes the expected cost of deception against all strategies
of the infiltrator. We first show that the underlying problem is a robust
mixed-integer linear program, which is intractable to solve in general. Towards
a scalable approach, we compute optimal finite-memory strategies for the
infiltrator by a reduction to a series of synthesis problems for parametric
Markov decision processes. We use these infiltration strategies to find robust
strategies for the deceiver using mixed-integer linear programming. We
illustrate the performance of our technique on a POSG model for network

design POMDP strategies leading to classification decisions. We present two

we could use a CTC loss in combination with an attention-based model in order

CTC/attention architecture for audio-visual recognition of speech in-the-wild.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a hybrid

1.3% absolute decrease in word error rate over the audio-only model and
achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on LRS2 database (7% word error

  Imaging",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical shape modeling is an important tool to characterize variation in
anatomical morphology. Typical shapes of interest are measured using 3D imaging
and a subsequent pipeline of registration, segmentation, and some extraction of
shape features or projections onto some lower-dimensional shape space, which
facilitates subsequent statistical analysis. Many methods for constructing
compact shape representations have been proposed, but are often impractical due
to the sequence of image preprocessing operations, which involve significant
parameter tuning, manual delineation, and/or quality control by the users. We
propose DeepSSM: a deep learning approach to extract a low-dimensional shape
representation directly from 3D images, requiring virtually no parameter tuning
or user assistance. DeepSSM uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that
simultaneously localizes the biological structure of interest, establishes
correspondences, and projects these points onto a low-dimensional shape
representation in the form of PCA loadings within a point distribution model.
To overcome the challenge of the limited availability of training images, we
present a novel data augmentation procedure that uses existing correspondences
on a relatively small set of processed images with shape statistics to create
plausible training samples with known shape parameters. Hence, we leverage the
limited CT/MRI scans (40-50) into thousands of images needed to train a CNN.
After the training, the CNN automatically produces accurate low-dimensional
shape representations for unseen images. We validate DeepSSM for three
different applications pertaining to modeling pediatric cranial CT for
characterization of metopic craniosynostosis, femur CT scans identifying
morphologic deformities of the hip due to femoroacetabular impingement, and
left atrium MRI scans for atrial fibrillation recurrence prediction.

empirical studies on how well it can predict the generalization gap. Our
measure is based on the concept of margin distribution, which are the distances
of training points to the decision boundary. We find that it is necessary to
use margin distributions at multiple layers of a deep network. On the CIFAR-10

the generalization gap. In addition, we find the following other factors to be
of importance: normalizing margin values for scale independence, using
characterizations of margin distribution rather than just the margin (closest
distance to decision boundary), and working in log space instead of linear
space (effectively using a product of margins rather than a sum). Our measure
can be easily applied to feedforward deep networks with any architecture and
may point towards new training loss functions that could enable better

However, most experiments to date used essentially weakly-confined plasmons,
which experience limited light-matter hybridization, thus limiting the
potential for decoherence. Here, we report quantum coherence of plasmons near
the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonance frequency, where plasmonic
dispersion and confinement is much stronger than in previous experiments. We
generated polarization-entangled pairs of photons using spontaneous parametric

reproduce a NSSL in numerical simulations of a solar-like convection zone by
increasing the density contrast across rotating, 3D spherical shells. We
explore the hypothesis that high density contrast leads to near-surface shear
by creating a rotationally unconstrained layer of fast flows near the outer
surface. Although our high-contrast models do have near-surface shear, it is
confined primarily to low latitudes (between $\pm15^\circ$). Two distinct types
of flow structures maintain the shear dynamically: rotationally
$\textit{constrained}$ Busse columns aligned with the rotation axis and fast,
rotationally $\textit{unconstrained}$ downflow plumes that deplete angular
momentum from the outer fluid layers. The plumes form at all latitudes, and in
fact are more efficient at transporting angular momentum inward at high
latitudes. The presence of Busse columns at low latitudes thus appears
essential to creating near-surface shear in our models. We conclude that a
solar-like NSSL is unobtainable from a rotationally unconstrained outer fluid
layer alone. In numerical models, the shear is eliminated through the advection
of angular momentum by the meridional circulation. Therefore, a detailed
understanding how the solar meridional circulation is dynamically achieved will
be necessary to elucidate the origin of the Sun's NSSL.

In this work, we aim to improve both the motion and observation models in
visual object tracking by leveraging representation power of CNNs. To this end,
a motion estimation network (named MEN) is utilized to seek the most likely
locations of the target and prepare a further clue in addition to the previous
target position. Hence the motion estimation would be enhanced by generating a
small number of candidates near two plausible positions. The generated
candidates are then fed into a trained Siamese network to detect the most
probable candidate. Each candidate is compared to an adaptable buffer, which is
updated under a predefined condition. To take into account the target
appearance changes, a weighting CNN (called WCNN) adaptively assigns weights to
the final similarity scores of the Siamese network using sequence-specific
information. Evaluation results on well-known benchmark datasets (OTB100, OTB50

to an improvement of the other. Both processes are sensitive to the interior
orientation parameters of the camera system and mathematically modelling these
systematic errors can often improve the precision and accuracy of the overall
solution. This paper presents an automatic camera calibration method suitable
for any lens, without having prior knowledge about the sensor. Statistical
inference is performed to map the environment and localize the camera
simultaneously. K-nearest neighbour regression is used to model the geometric
distortions of the images. A normal-angle lens Nikon camera and wide-angle lens
GoPro camera were calibrated using the proposed method, as well as the
conventional bundle adjustment with self-calibration method (for comparison).
Results showed that the mapping error was reduced from an average of 14.9 mm to
1.2 mm (i.e. a 92% improvement) and 66.6 mm to 1.5 mm (i.e. a 98% improvement)

irrespective of the lens/sensor used: it yields results that are comparable to

primarily on two pairs of commuting operators that are naturally associated

between operator-theoretic properties of the pairs and the structure of the

heterogeneous agents. Motivated by numerous applications of such dynamics in
social sciences, in this paper we provide a new direction toward analysis of
dynamic networks of heterogeneous agents under complex time-varying

exists an inappropriate correlation between gradient $g_t$ and the
second-moment term $v_t$ in Adam ($t$ is the timestep), which results in that a
large gradient is likely to have small step size while a small gradient may
have a large step size. We demonstrate that such biased step sizes are the
fundamental cause of non-convergence of Adam, and we further prove that
decorrelating $v_t$ and $g_t$ will lead to unbiased step size for each
gradient, thus solving the non-convergence problem of Adam. Finally, we propose
AdaShift, a novel adaptive learning rate method that decorrelates $v_t$ and
$g_t$ by temporal shifting, i.e., using temporally shifted gradient $g_{t-n}$
to calculate $v_t$. The experiment results demonstrate that AdaShift is able to
address the non-convergence issue of Adam, while still maintaining a
competitive performance with Adam in terms of both training speed and

However, it is challenging for existing LfD methods to efficiently learn skills

generates joint-space trajectories by imitating motions from expert behavior.
Given a few demonstrations, we show in real robot experiments that the learned
STM can quickly generalize to unseen tasks and synthesize motions having longer
time horizons than the expert trajectories. Compared to conventional motion
planners, our approach enables the robot to accomplish complex behaviors from
high-level instructions without laborious hand-engineering of planning
objectives, while being able to adapt to changing goals during the skill

optimal collaboration by directly controlling the agents to maximize a common
reward. In this paper, we aim to address this from a different angle. In
particular, we consider scenarios where there are self-interested agents (i.e.,
worker agents) which have their own minds (preferences, intentions, skills,
etc.) and can not be dictated to perform tasks they do not wish to do. For
achieving optimal coordination among these agents, we train a super agent
(i.e., the manager) to manage them by first inferring their minds based on both
current and past observations and then initiating contracts to assign suitable
tasks to workers and promise to reward them with corresponding bonuses so that
they will agree to work together. The objective of the manager is maximizing
the overall productivity as well as minimizing payments made to the workers for
ad-hoc worker teaming. To train the manager, we propose Mind-aware Multi-agent
Management Reinforcement Learning (M^3RL), which consists of agent modeling and
policy learning. We have evaluated our approach in two environments, Resource
Collection and Crafting, to simulate multi-agent management problems with
various task settings and multiple designs for the worker agents. The
experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our approach in
modeling worker agents' minds online, and in achieving optimal ad-hoc teaming
with good generalization and fast adaptation.

algorithm making quantified clauses redundant in subspaces and merging the
results of branches. To implement this algorithm we developed the machinery of
D-sequents. A D-sequent is a record stating that a quantified clause is
redundant in a specified subspace. Redundancy of a clause is a structural
property (i.e. it holds only for a subset of logically equivalent formulas as

re-using conflict clauses in SAT-solving. In this paper, we address this

them with that from the general relativity (GR). For the third generation
ground-based GW observatory, with one typical strongly lensed GW+EM event, and
assuming that the dominated error from the stellar velocity dispersions is 5\%,
the GW time-delay data can distinguish an 18\% MG effect on a scale of tens of

Isothermal Sphere mass model, there exists a simplified consistency
relationship between time-delay and imaging data. This relationship does not
require for the velocity dispersion measurement, and hence can avoid major
uncertainties. By using this relationship, the multimessenger approach is able
to distinguish an $8\%$ MG effect. Our results show that the GW multimessenger

separation. It is also found that the diffusion intensity plays a positive role
in improving the searching success. The nonlinear double-well drift could drive
the protein to reach the target with a larger possibility than the linear drag
at initial time period, but viewing at the long time evolution, the linear
drift is more beneficial for target searching success. In contrast to the
linear drift case, the search reliability and efficiency with nonlinear drift
have a monotonic relationship with the $\alpha$ index, that is, the smaller the
$\alpha$ index is, the more possibly a protein finds its target.

The
Flow Completion Time (FCT) is a vital network performance metric that affects
the running time of distributed applications and the users' quality of
experience. Flow routing techniques based on propagation or queuing latency or
instantaneous link utilization are insufficient for minimization of the long
flows' FCT. We propose a routing approach that uses the remaining sizes and
paths of all ongoing flows to minimize the worst-case completion time of
incoming flows assuming no knowledge of future flow arrivals. Our approach can
be formulated as an NP-Hard graph optimization problem. We propose BWRH, a
heuristic to quickly generate an approximate solution. We evaluate BWRH against
several real WAN topologies and two different traffic patterns. We see that
BWRH provides solutions with an average optimality gap of less than $0.25\%$.
Furthermore, we show that compared to other popular routing heuristics, BWRH
reduces the mean and tail FCT by up to $1.46\times$ and $1.53\times$,

energetic electrons, with radiative energies reaching the GeV energy for binary

even at low temperature, is a key requirement of many protocols used in quantum

inefficient protocols, limiting the fidelity of ensuing operations or the
measurement sensitivity. We introduce here a class of dynamical nuclear spin
state selective (DNSS) protocols which, when applied to a polarised electron
spin such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, permit the addressing
of selected nuclear states of the mixture. It works by splitting the underlying
eigenstates into two distinct symmetries dependent on the nuclear spin state,
and independent of the electron-nuclear coupling strength. As a particular
example, we show that DNSS is achievable by simply introducing a detuning in
the common Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocol, where the state selection
is then controlled by the inter-pulse spacing. This approach offers advantages
in ultra-high fidelity initialisation of nuclear registers, ensemble
polarisation and single-gate manipulation of nuclei.

grounding and high-level planning, which are based on manually-designed

gradient method is then applied to refine the modules, in which two terms for
updating the modules are considered. The first term, called a reinforcement
term, contributes to updating the modules to improve the overall performance of
a hierarchical planner to produce appropriate plans. The second term, called a
penalty term, contributes to keeping refined modules consistent with the
manually-designed original modules. Namely, it keeps the planner, which uses
the refined modules, producing interpretable plans. We perform preliminary
experiments to solve the Mountain car problem, and its results show that a
manually-designed high-level planner and symbol grounding function were
successfully refined by our framework.

The apparent persistence lengths of a set of short chains have been computed as
a function of the twist conformation both in the over-twisted and the untwisted
regimes, whereby the equilibrium twist is selected by free energy minimization.
The obtained values are significantly lower than those generally attributed to
kilo-base long DNA. This points to an intrinsic helix flexibility at short
length scales, arising from large fluctuational effects and local bending, in
line with recent experimental indications. The interplay between helical
untwisting and persistence length has been discussed for a heterogeneous
fragment by weighing the effects of the sequence specificities through the

the nominal operation mode. The controller is designed such that all fixed-wing
UAVs as a group can collaboratively track a desired target's position and

and the target to ensure that the tracking objective can be achieved when UAVs
are subject to constant speed constraints. We construct a reference velocity
that includes both the target's velocity and position as feedback, which is to
be tracked by the group centroid. In this way, all vehicles' headings are
controlled such that the group centroid follows a reference trajectory that
successfully tracks the target's trajectory. A spacing controller is further
devised to ensure that all vehicles stay close to the group centroid
trajectory. Trade-offs in the controller design and performance limitations of
the target tracking control due to the constant-speed constraint are also
discussed in detail. Experimental results with three fixed-wing UAVs tracking a

scheme, then it is modified such that in each iteration i) the flow velocity is
guided by an ordinary differential equation that is asymptotic-preserving at
the Navier-Stokes limit and ii) the shear stress is equal to the average shear
stress. Based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, the SIS is assessed to be
efficient and accurate. Then we investigate the Kramer's problem for gases
interacting through the inverse power-law, shielded Coulomb, and Lennard-Jones
potentials, subject to diffuse-specular and Cercignani-Lampis gas-surface
boundary conditions. When the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient
(TMAC) is not larger than one, the Knudsen layer function is strongly affected
by the potential, where its value and width increase with the effective
viscosity index of gas molecules. Moreover, the Knudsen layer function exhibits
similarities among different values of TMAC when the intermolecular potential
is fixed. For Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition with TMAC larger than one,
both the viscous slip coefficient and Knudsen layer function are affected by
the intermolecular potential, especially when the ""backward"" scattering limit
is approached. With the asymptotic theory by Jiang and Luo for the singular
behavior of the velocity gradient in the vicinity of the solid surface, we find
that the whole Knudsen layer function can be well fitted by power series.

layers with enhanced dynamics. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a
bead-spring model, we study a wide variety of layer-resolved structural and
dynamical properties of polymer films equilibrated at a low temperature.
Surface enhancement on thermally induced particle hopping rate is found to
terminate abruptly only about 5 particle diameters from the free surface. In
contrast, enhancement on the net motions of particles measured at longer time
scales penetrates at least 2 particle diameters deeper. The diverse penetration
depths show the existence of a peculiar sublayer, referred to as the
inner-surface layer, in which surface enhanced mobility is not caused by more
frequent particle hops but instead by a reduced dynamic heterogeneity
associated with diminished hopping anti-correlations. Confinement effects of
the free surface thus provide a unique mechanism for varying the dynamic
heterogeneity and hopping correlations while keeping the hopping rate constant.
Our results highlight the importance of correlations among elementary motions
to glassy slowdown and suggest that dynamic facilitation is mediated via
perturbations to the correlations rather than the rate of elementary motions.

arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) devices and multicasting based on star couplers
hold promise for flexibly addressing the exponentially growing traffic demands
in a cost- and power-efficient fashion. In a default switching scenario, an
input port of the AWG is connected to an output port via a single wavelength.
This can severely limit the capacity between broadcast domains, resulting in
interdomain traffic switching bottlenecks. In this paper, we examine the
possibility of resolving capacity bottlenecks by exploiting multiple AWG free
spectral ranges (FSRs), i.e., setting up multiple parallel connections between
each pair of broadcast domains. To this end, we introduce a multi-FSR
scheduling algorithm for interconnecting broadcast domains by fairly
distributing the wavelength resources among them. We develop a general-purpose
analytical framework to study the blocking probabilities in a multistage
switching scenario and compare our results with Monte Carlo simulations. Our
study points to significant improvements with a moderate increase in the number
of FSRs. We show that an FSR count beyond four results in diminishing returns.
Furthermore, to investigate the trade-offs between the network- and
physical-layer effects, we conduct a cross-layer analysis, taking into account
pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rate-adaptive forward error correction
(FEC). We illustrate how the effective bit rate per port increases with an
increase in the number of FSRs. %We also look at the advantages of an
impairment-aware scheduling strategy in a multi-FSR switching scenario.

Consequently, the secret key extracted from that signature has been recovered
by observing the surrounding links. Prior work assumes theoretical
link-correlation models for the inference, in contrast, our study does not make
any assumption on link correlation. Instead, we take machine learning (ML)
methods for link inference based on empirically measured link signatures. ML
algorithms have been developed to launch SIAs under various realistic
scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed inference
algorithms are still quite effective even without making assumptions on link
correlation. In addition, our inference algorithms can reduce the key search
space by many orders of magnitudes compared to brute force search. We further
propose a countermeasure against the statistical inference attacks, FBCH
(forward-backward cooperative key extraction protocol with helpers). In the
FBCH, helpers (other trusted wireless nodes) are introduced to provide more
randomness in the key extraction. Our experiment results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

insulator surface between the electrodes, a surface discharge with one of the
electrodes being placed far away from the insulator is achieved in this paper.
The unique electric field distribution due to the multi-anode electrode
geometry has a significant influence on the discharge process of the surface
discharge. It changes the generation and propagation process of the plasma,
forming a plasma plume contributes to the propulsion performance of the
thruster. Through theoretical analysis of the obtained plume data, it is
indicated that the ablative pulsed plasma thruster based on multi-anode
electrode geometry (short for multi-anode APPT) promotes the internal pressure
of the plasma jet during its propagation and significantly increases the
density and energy of charged particles. The discharge phenomena manifest that
the multi-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode APPT effectively increase

APPT increases the density of plasma in the axial direction to more than 4
times of the conventional coaxial APPT and reduces the electron density in
other directions. In the propulsion test, it has been demonstrated that the

presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, the magnetic and electronic structures
of kagome lattices are further entangled, which can lead to hitherto unknown
spin-orbit phenomena. Here we use a combination of vector-magnetic-field
capability and scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the spin-orbit
nature of the kagome ferromagnet Fe3Sn2 and explore the associated exotic

interference reveals consistent spontaneous nematicity-a clear indication of
electron correlation-and vector magnetization is capable of altering this
state, thus controlling the many-body electronic symmetry. These spin-driven
giant electronic responses go well beyond Zeeman physics and point to the
realization of an underlying correlated magnetic topological phase. The
tunability of this kagome magnet reveals a strong interplay between an
externally applied field, electronic excitations and nematicity, providing new
ways of controlling spin-orbit properties and exploring emergent phenomena in
topological or quantum materials.

domain translation. However, there is still a wide gap in the quality of
results when learning such tasks on musical audio. Furthermore, most
translation models only enable one-to-one or one-to-many transfer by relying on
separate encoders or decoders and complex, computationally-heavy models. In
this paper, we introduce the Modulated Variational auto-Encoders (MoVE) to
perform musical timbre transfer. We define timbre transfer as applying parts of
the auditory properties of a musical instrument onto another. First, we show
that we can achieve this task by conditioning existing domain translation
techniques with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Then, we alleviate the
need for additional adversarial networks by replacing the usual translation
criterion by a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) objective. This allows a faster
and more stable training along with a controllable latent space encoder. By
further conditioning our system on several different instruments, we can
generalize to many-to-many transfer within a single variational architecture
able to perform multi-domain transfers. Our models map inputs to 3-dimensional
representations, successfully translating timbre from one instrument to another
and supporting sound synthesis from a reduced set of control parameters. We
evaluate our method in reconstruction and generation tasks while analyzing the
auditory descriptor distributions across transferred domains. We show that this
architecture allows for generative controls in multi-domain transfer, yet
remaining light, fast to train and effective on small datasets.

(MNMF) is one of powerful approaches, which adopts the NMF concept for source
power spectrogram modeling. This concept is also employed in Independent
Low-Rank Matrix Analysis (ILRMA), a special class of the MNMF framework
formulated under determined conditions. While these methods work reasonably
well for particular types of sound sources, one limitation is that they can
fail to work for sources with spectrograms that do not comply with the NMF
model. To address this limitation, an extension of ILRMA called the
Multichannel Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) method was recently proposed, where
a Conditional VAE (CVAE) is used instead of the NMF model for source power
spectrogram modeling. This approach has shown to perform impressively in
determined source separation tasks thanks to the representation power of DNNs.
While the original MVAE method was formulated under determined mixing
conditions, this paper generalizes it so that it can also deal with
underdetermined cases. We call the proposed framework the Generalized MVAE
(GMVAE). The proposed method was evaluated on a underdetermined source
separation task of separating out three sources from two microphone inputs.
Experimental results revealed that the GMVAE method achieved better performance
than the MNMF method.

high validity in proving that neither non-semilocking boundary points nor

produces images called micrographs. Projections of the molecule of interest are
embedded in the micrographs at unknown locations, and under unknown viewing
directions. Standard imaging techniques first locate these projections
(detection) and then reconstruct the 3-D structure from them. Unfortunately,
high noise levels hinder detection. When reliable detection is rendered
impossible, the standard techniques fail. This is a problem, especially for
small molecules. In this paper, we pursue a radically different approach: we
contend that the structure could, in principle, be reconstructed directly from
the micrographs, without intermediate detection. The aim is to bring small
molecules within reach for cryo-EM. To this end, we design an autocorrelation
analysis technique that allows to go directly from the micrographs to the

challenging since compound attributes contain heterogeneous data with various
feature patterns such as drug fingerprint, drug physicochemical property, drug
perturbation gene expression. Moreover, there is complex nonlinear dependency
among heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-adversarial
multi-task framework for integrating shared knowledge from multiple domains.
The framework utilizes the adversarial strategy to effectively learn target
representations and models their nonlinear dependency. Experiments on two
real-world datasets illustrate that the performance of our approach obtains an
obvious improvement over competitive baselines. The novel therapeutic
properties of purpose-unknown compounds we predicted are mostly reported or
brought to the clinics. Furthermore, our framework can integrate various
attributes beyond the three domains examined here and can be applied in the
industry for screening the purpose of huge amounts of as yet unidentified
compounds. Source codes of this paper are available on Github.

lower size ranges of up to 60cm, but beyond that humanoid robots scale up
quickly in weight and price, becoming less affordable and more difficult to
operate, maintain and modify. The igus Humanoid Open Platform is an affordable,
fully open-source platform for humanoid research. At 92cm, the robot is capable
of acting in an environment meant for humans, and is equipped with enough
sensors, actuators and computing power to support researchers in many fields.
The structure of the robot is entirely 3D printed, leading to a lightweight and
visually appealing design. This paper covers the mechanical and electrical

such limits, we developed a novel approach involving a learning algorithm,

patterning at small scales in applications ranging from photovoltaics to
microfluidic devices. Static wrinkle patterns are known to be governed by an
energetic balance between the object's bending stiffness and an effective
substrate stiffness, which may originate from a true substrate stiffness or
from tension and curvature along the wrinkles. Here we investigate dynamic
wrinkling, induced by the impact of a solid sphere onto an ultra-thin polymer
sheet floating on water. The vertical deflection of the sheet's centre induced
by impact draws material radially inwards, resulting in an azimuthal
compression that is relieved by the wrinkling of the entire sheet. We show that
this wrinkling is truly dynamic, exhibiting features that are qualitatively
different to those seen in quasi-static wrinkling experiments. Moreover, we
show that the wrinkles coarsen dynamically because of the inhibiting effect of
the fluid inertia. This dynamic coarsening can be understood heuristically as
the result of a dynamic stiffness, which dominates the static stiffnesses
reported thus far, and allows new controls of wrinkle wavelength.

$\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}$, which converges when ${\rm Re}\,s>1$. The Riemann

${\rm Re}\,s= \frac{1}{2}$. Thus, to find these zeros it is necessary to
perform an analytic continuation to a region of complex $s$ for which the
defining sum does not converge. This analytic continuation is ordinarily
performed by using a functional equation. In this paper it is argued that one
can investigate some properties of the Riemann zeta function in the region
${\rm Re}\,s<1$ by allowing operator-valued zeta functions to act on test
functions. As an illustration, it is shown that the locations of the trivial
zeros can be determined purely from a Fourier series, without relying on an
explicit analytic continuation of the functional equation satisfied by
