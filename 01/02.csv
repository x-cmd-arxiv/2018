peculiar fact of this AR is that it was associated with only one CME in spite
of producing several X-class flares. In this work, we carry out a comparative
study between the eruptive and non-eruptive flares produced by AR 12192. We
find that the magnitude of abrupt and permanent changes in the horizontal
magnetic field and Lorentz force are significantly smaller in the case of the
confined flares compared to the eruptive one. We present the areal evolution of
AR 12192 during its disc passage. We find the flare-related morphological
changes to be weaker during the confined flares, whereas the eruptive flare
exhibits a rapid and permanent disappearance of penumbral area away from the
magnetic neutral line after the flare. Furthermore, from the extrapolated
nonlinear force-free magnetic field, we examine the overlying coronal magnetic
environment over the eruptive and non-eruptive zones of the AR. We find that
the critical decay index for the onset of torus instability was achieved at a
lower height over the eruptive flaring region, than for the non-eruptive core
area. These results suggest that the decay rate of the gradient of overlying
magnetic field strength may play a decisive role to determine the CME
productivity of the AR. In addition, the magnitude of changes in the

Essentially, in the first stage a fast method generates a significant but

further benefits from the two-stage cascade strategy. More concretely, the
enriched and subsequently compressed features used in the first stage are
reused as the CNN input. As a consequence, a simpler network architecture,
adapted for such small input sizes, allows to achieve real-time performance and
obtain results close to the state-of-the-art while running significantly faster
without the use of GPU. In particular, considering that the proposed pipeline
runs in frame rate, the achieved performance is highly competitive. We
furthermore demonstrate that the proposed pipeline on itself can serve as an

(i.e., the pigment Hamiltonian parameter space) and especially, the
relationship between the site excitation energies, determines whether one of
two specific environmental regimes is the most beneficial in promoting
efficient EET in these model systems. In the first regime, optimal
environmental conditions are such that the EET dynamics in the system is left
as coherent as possible. In the second regime, the most advantageous role of
the environment is to drive the system towards equilibrium as fast as possible.
In reality, optimal environmental conditions may involve a combination of these
two effects. We cannot establish a relation between efficient EET and
non-Markovianity, i.e., non-Markovianity cannot be regarded as a resource in

the static case with a spherically symmetric source for both the vector and
scalar (tensor) unparticles. We obtain thus analytical expressions to the
principal thermodynamic quantities: Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity
and free energy. For the scalar (tensor) case we find that the black hole
presents a residual value for the entropy when its radius goes to zero but the
other thermodynamic quantities give, for any horizon radius, a
thermodynamically unstable behavior similar to the standard black hole. For the
vector case we find a richer structure in the region in which the horizon
radius is less than the characteristic length of the unparticle theory. We
identify a phase transition and a region where the black hole can be
thermodynamically stable. Following, we show that the mentioned modifications
in the standard gravity are formally similar to those ones present in the black
holes with quintessence. With this we also show, notwithstanding, that the
unparticles cannot be a source of quintessence. By using this similarity we
find two different rotating solutions to the unparticle black holes based on
works by Ghosh and Toshmatov {\it et al}. For both cases we compute the Hawking
temperature and in the ungravity dominated regime we find, as in the static
cases, a fractalization of the event horizon. For the Gosh-like solution the
fractal dimension depends on the polar angle and on the rotation of the source.

fractalization is not dependent on the rotation of the source.

literature suggest that, when the number of agents and the average amount of
money per agent are large, the distribution of money at equilibrium approaches
the exponential distribution for the first model, the gamma distribution with
shape parameter two for the second model and a gamma distribution whose shape
parameter depends on the saving propensity for the third model. The main
objective of this paper is to give rigorous proofs of and extend these
conjectures to generalizations of the first two models and a variant of the
third model that include local rather than global interactions, i.e., instead
of choosing the two interacting agents uniformly at random from the system, the
agents are located on the vertex set of a general connected graph and can only
interact with their neighbors.

$2.9\pm0.1$ $M_{\odot}$. The ages are found $635\pm33$ Myr for HD 23193 and
$480\pm50$ Myr for HD 170920 using isochrones. The abundance pattern of HD
23193 shows deviations from solar values in the iron-peak elements and
indicates remarkable overabundances of Sr (1.16), Y (1.03), and Ba (1.24) with
respect to the solar abundances. We compare the derived abundances of this

chemical evolution models including rotational mixing. The theoretically
predicted abundances resemble our derived abundance pattern, except for a few
elements (Si and Cr). For HD 170920, we find nearly solar abundances, except
for C ($-0.43$), S (0.16), Ti (0.15), Ni (0.16), Zn (0.41), Y (0.57), and Ba

and if not, to estimate this spin equilibrium frequency. These can be done
using specific measurable source luminosities, such as the luminosity
corresponding to the transition between the accretion and propeller phases, and
the known stellar spin rate. Such a finding can be useful to test if the spin

particularly successful in modeling transport phenomena involving complex
boundaries and interfacial dynamics. The LB method can be considered to be an
efficient numerical tool for fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media.

for investigating transient solid-liquid phase-change processes wherein the
interfacial behaviors are very important. In this article, a comprehensive
review of the LB methods for single-phase and solid-liquid phase-change heat

Marginal Pricing, is designed for ES. The pricing model is derived by
evaluating ES impact on the network power flows and congestion from the loss
and congestion components in Location Marginal Pricing. The impact is then
converted into an hourly economic signal to reflect ES operation. The proposed
ES C/D strategy and pricing methods are validated on a real local Grid Supply
Point area. Results show that the proposed Location Marginal Pricing-based
pricing is efficient to capture the feature of ES and provide signals for
affecting its operation. This work can further increase network flexibility and
the capability of networks to accommodate increasing WT penetration.

'deep-belief networks', are powerful neural networks that have found
applications in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The
standard way to training these models resorts to an iterative unsupervised
procedure based on Gibbs sampling, called 'contrastive divergence' (CD), and
additional supervised tuning via back-propagation. However, this procedure has
been shown not to follow any gradient and can lead to suboptimal solutions. In
this paper, we show an efficient alternative to CD by means of simulations of
digital memcomputing machines (DMMs). We test our approach on pattern
recognition using a modified version of the MNIST data set. DMMs sample
effectively the vast phase space given by the model distribution of the RBM,
and provide a very good approximation close to the optimum. This efficient
search significantly reduces the number of pretraining iterations necessary to
achieve a given level of accuracy, as well as a total performance gain over CD.
In fact, the acceleration of pretraining achieved by simulating DMMs is
comparable to, in number of iterations, the recently reported hardware
application of the quantum annealing method on the same network and data set.
Notably, however, DMMs perform far better than the reported quantum annealing
results in terms of quality of the training. We also compare our method to
advances in supervised training, like batch-normalization and rectifiers, that
work to reduce the advantage of pretraining. We find that the memcomputing
method still maintains a quality advantage ($>1\%$ in accuracy, and a $20\%$
reduction in error rate) over these approaches. Furthermore, our method is
agnostic about the connectivity of the network. Therefore, it can be extended
to train full Boltzmann machines, and even deep networks at once.

$g-2$, dark matter and LHC data, non-universal gaugino masses $M_i$ at the high
scale are required in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM). We also need a right-handed smuon $\tilde\mu_R$ with a mass
around 100 GeV, evading LHC searches due to the proximity of a neutralino
$\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ several GeV lighter which allows successful dark matter. We
discuss such a scenario in the framework of an $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory
(GUT) combined with $A_4$ family symmetry, where the three $\overline{5}$
representations form a single triplet of $A_4$ with a unified soft mass $m_F$,
while the three $10$ representations are singlets of $A_4$ with independent
soft masses $m_{T1}, m_{T2}, m_{T3}$. Although $m_{T2}$ (and hence
$\tilde\mu_R$) may be light, the muon $g-2$ and relic density also requires
light $M_1\simeq 250$ GeV, which is incompatible with universal gaugino masses
due to LHC constraints on $M_2$ and $M_3$ arising from gaugino searches. After
showing that universal gaugino masses $M_{1/2}$ at the GUT scale are excluded
by gluino searches, we provide a series of benchmarks which show that while
$M_{1}= M_{2} \ll M_3$ is also excluded by chargino searches, $M_{1}< M_{2} \ll
M_3$ is currently allowed. Even this scenario is almost excluded by the tension
between the muon $g-2$, relic density, Dark Matter direct detection and LHC
data. The surviving parameter space is characterised by a higgsino mass $\mu
\approx -300$ GeV, as required by the muon $g-2$. The LHC will be able to fully
test this scenario with the upgraded luminosity via muon-dominated tri- and
di-lepton signatures resulting from higgsino dominated $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1 \,
\tilde{\chi}^0_2$ and $\tilde{\chi}^+_1 \, \tilde{\chi}^-_1$ production.

organize the macroscopic behaviors in such systems. Despite a century of
effort, they have eluded rigorous analysis and empirical prediction, with
progress being made only recently. As a step in this, we present a formal
theory of coherent structures in fully-discrete dynamical field theories. It
builds on the notion of structure introduced by computational mechanics,
generalizing it to a local spatiotemporal setting. The analysis' main tool
employs the \localstates, which are used to uncover a system's hidden
spatiotemporal symmetries and which identify coherent structures as
spatially-localized deviations from those symmetries. The approach is
behavior-driven in the sense that it does not rely on directly analyzing
spatiotemporal equations of motion, rather it considers only the spatiotemporal
fields a system generates. As such, it offers an unsupervised approach to
discover and describe coherent structures. We illustrate the approach by
analyzing coherent structures generated by elementary cellular automata,
comparing the results with an earlier, dynamic-invariant-set approach that
decomposes fields into domains, particles, and particle interactions.

detection, which precisely describe when achieving optimal detection is easy,

a surprising computational barrier when the sparsity level $k$ exceeds the

long sequences of additive steps. The increasing sophistication of printers,
materials, and generative design promises to make geometric complexity a
non-issue in manufacturing; however, this complexity can only be realized if a
design can be translated into a physically executable sequence of printing
operations. We investigate this planning problem for freeform direct-write
assembly, in which filaments of material are deposited through a nozzle
translating along a 3D path to create sparse, frame-like structures. We
enumerate the process constraints for different variants of the freeform
assembly process and show that, in the case where material stiffens via a glass
transition, determining whether a feasible sequence exists is NP-complete.
Nonetheless, for topologies typically encountered in real-world applications,
finding a feasible or even optimal sequence is a tractable problem. We develop
a sequencing algorithm that maximizes the fidelity of the printed part and
minimizes the probability of print failure by modeling the assembly as a
linear, elastic frame. We implement the algorithm and validate our approach
experimentally, printing objects composed of thousands of sugar alcohol
filaments with diameters of 100-200 microns. The assembly planner allows the
freeform process to be applied to arbitrarily complex parts, from tissue
engineering and microfluidics at the micrometer scale, to vascularized
functional materials and soft robots at the millimeter scale, to structural
components at the meter scale, thus opening a variety of assembly
possibilities.

reported contest outcome is ""correct"" (meaning that the tabulation of votes was
properly performed), or else the tabulation audit determines the correct
outcome.
  Stark proposed risk-limiting tabulation audits for this purpose; such audits
are effective and are beginning to be used in practice.
  We expand the study of election audits based on Bayesian methods, first
introduced by Rivest and Shen in 2012. (The risk-limiting audits proposed by
Stark are ""frequentist"" rather than Bayesian in character.)
  We first provide a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A
Bayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes in
that contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers what effect
statistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such
variations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit
terminates, accepting the reported outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated
with an enlarged sample.
  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with any method for
determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).
  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex
situations, such as auditing contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions},
or are otherwise ""stratified.""
  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some
of the jurisdictions have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast
paper vote, while the others do not. Complex situations such as this may arise
naturally when some counties in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while
others have not. Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations in a
straightforward manner.
  We also discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using Bayesian
audits in practice.

based on the connection of coherence and the Kirchhoff index, we study
analytically the coherence of two deterministically-growing sparse networks and
obtain the exact expressions, which tend to small constants. Our results

the action of closed characteristics of $\Omega$, which generalises both the

photo-chromatic applications, V2O5 is also reported to exhibit a semiconductor
to metal transition (SMT) at a temperature range of 530-560K. Even though,
there are debates in using the term 'SMT' for V2O5, the metallic behavior above
transition temperature and its origin are of great interests in the scientific
community. In this study, V2O5 nanostructures were deposited on SiO2/Si
substrate by vapour transport method using Au as catalyst. Temperature
dependent electrical measurement confirms the SMT in V2O5 without any
structural change. Temperature dependent photoluminescence analysis proves the
appearance of oxygen vacancy related peaks due to reduction of V2O5 above the
transition temperature, as also inferred from temperature dependent Raman
spectroscopic studies. The newly evolved defect levels in the V2O5 electronic
structure with increasing temperature is also understood from the downward
shift of the bottom most split-off conduction bands due to breakdown of pd{\pi}
bonds leading to metallic behavior in V2O5 above the transition temperature.

forecasting, where the state of the physical system is estimated from model
outputs and observations, and is then used as initial condition to produce
accurate future forecasts. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) provides a
practical implementation of the statistical solution of the data assimilation
problem and has gained wide popularity as. This success can be attributed to
its simple formulation and ease of implementation. EnKF is a Monte-Carlo
algorithm that solves the data assimilation problem by sampling the probability
distributions involved in Bayes theorem. Because of this, all flavors of EnKF
are fundamentally prone to sampling errors when the ensemble size is small. In
typical weather forecasting applications, the model state space has dimension
$10^{9}-10^{12}$, while the ensemble size typically ranges between $30-100$
members. Sampling errors manifest themselves as long-range spurious
correlations and have been shown to cause filter divergence. To alleviate this
effect covariance localization dampens spurious correlations between state
variables located at a large distance in the physical space, via an empirical
distance-dependent function. The quality of the resulting analysis and forecast
is greatly influenced by the choice of the localization function parameters,
e.g., the radius of influence. The localization radius is generally tuned
empirically to yield desirable results.This work, proposes two adaptive
algorithms for covariance localization in the EnKF framework, both based on a
machine learning approach. The first algorithm adapts the localization radius
in time, while the second algorithm tunes the localization radius in both time
and space. Numerical experiments carried out with the Lorenz-96 model, and a
quasi-geostrophic model, reveal the potential of the proposed machine learning

are clustering and sketching. Here, clustering refers to the problem of
partitioning some input metric measure space (mm-space) into k clusters,
minimizing some objective function f. Sketching, on the other hand, is the
problem of approximating some mm-space by a smaller one supported on a set of k
points. Specifically, we define the k-sketch of some mm-space M to be the
nearest neighbor of M in the set of k-point mm-spaces, under some distance
function \rho on the set of mm-spaces. In this paper, we demonstrate a duality
between general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a
general method for efficiently transforming a solution for a clustering problem
to a solution for a sketching problem, and vice versa, with approximately equal
cost. More specifically, we obtain the following results. 1. For metric spaces,
we consider the case where the clustering objective is minimizing the maximum
cluster diameter. We show that the ratio between the sketching and clustering
objectives is constant over compact metric spaces. 2. We extend these results
to the setting of metric measure spaces where we prove that the ratio of
sketching to clustering objectives is bounded both above and below by some
universal constants. In this setting, the clustering objective involves
minimizing various notions of the l_p-diameters} of the clusters. 3. We
consider two competing notions of sketching for mm-spaces, with one of them
being more demanding than the other. These notions arise from two different
definitions of p-Gromov-Wasserstein distance that have appeared in the
literature. We then prove that whereas the gap between these can be arbitrarily
large, in the case of doubling metric spaces the resulting sketching objectives
are polynomially related.

solar convection simulations might be over-estimated (convective conundrum).
One plausible solution to this could be the small-scale dynamo which cannot be
fully resolved by global simulations. The small-scale Lorentz force suppresses
the convective motions and also the turbulent mixing of entropy between upflows
and downflows, leading to a large effective Prandtl number ($\Pr$). We explore
this idea in three-dimensional global rotating convection simulations at
different thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), i.e., at different $\Pr$. In
agreement with previous non-rotating simulations, the convective velocity is
reduced with the increase of $\Pr$ as long as the thermal conductive flux is
negligible. A subadiabatic layer is formed near the base of the convection zone
due to continuous deposition of low entropy plumes in low-$\kappa$ simulations.
The most interesting result of our low-$\kappa$ simulations is that the
convective motions are accompanied by a change in the convection structure that
is increasingly influenced by small-scale plumes. These plumes tend to
transport angular momentum radially inward and thus establish an anti-solar
differential rotation, in striking contrast to the solar rotation profile. If
such low diffusive plumes, driven by the radiative-surface cooling, are present
in the Sun, then our results cast doubt on the idea that a high effective $\Pr$
may be a viable solution to the solar convective conundrum. Our study also
emphasizes that any resolution of the conundrum that relies on the downward
plumes must take into account angular momentum transport as well as heat
transport.

the idea that galaxies and clusters could have highly condensed cores of dark
matter (DM) within their central regions. In particular, it has been suggested
that dark matter could form Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs) or degenerate
Fermi cores. We examine these possibilities under the assumption that the core
consists of highly condensed DM (either bosons or fermions) that is embedded in
a diffuse envelope (e.g., isothermal sphere). The novelty of our approach is
that we invoke composite polytropes to model spherical collisionless structures
in a way that is physically intuitive and can be generalized to include other
equations of state (EOSs). Our model is very amenable to the analysis of BEC
cores (composed of ultra-light bosons) that have been proposed to resolve
small-scale CDM anomalies. We show that the analysis can readily be applied to
bosons with or without small repulsive self-interactions. With respect to
degenerate Fermi cores, we confirm that fermionic particle masses between 1 --
1000 keV are not excluded by the observations. Finally, we note that this
approach can be extended to include a wide range of EOSs in addition to
multi-component collisionless systems.

in robustly transporting various types of energy in a flaw and
defect-insensitive fashion. While there have been a significant number of
studies based on discovering and proposing topological materials and
structures, very few have focused on tuning the resulting topological bandgaps,
which is critical because the bandgap frequency is fixed once the structure has
been fabricated. Here, we perform both lattice dynamical calculations and
molecular dynamical simulations to investigate strain effects on the phononic
topological bandgaps in two-dimensional monolayer hexagonal boron nitride. Our
studies demonstrate that while the topologically protected phononic bandgaps
are not closed even for severely deformed hexagonal boron nitride, and are
relatively insensitive to uniaxial tension and shear strains, the position of
the frequency gap can be efficiently tuned in a wide range through the
application of biaxial strains. Overall, this work thus demonstrates that
topological phonons are robust against the effects of mechanical strain
engineering, and sheds light on the tunability of the topological bandgaps in
nanomaterials.

used to measure the three-dimensional (3D) refractive index distribution within
living cells without the requirement of any marker. In principle, ODT can be
regarded as a generalization of optical projection tomography which is
equivalent to computerized tomography (CT). Both optical tomographic techniques
require projection-phase images of cells measured at multiple angles. However,
the reconstruction of the 3D refractive index distribution post-measurement
differs for the two techniques. It is known that ODT yields better results than
projection tomography, because it takes into account diffraction of the imaging
light due to the refractive index structure of the sample. Here, we apply ODT
to biological cells in a microfluidic chip which combines optical trapping and
microfluidic flow to achieve an optofluidic single-cell rotation. In
particular, we address the problem that arises when the trapped cell is not
rotating about an axis perpendicular to the imaging plane, but instead about an
arbitrarily tilted axis. In this paper we show that the 3D reconstruction can
be improved by taking into account such a tilted rotational axis in the
reconstruction process.

pivotal in the recent advances in fault tolerant quantum computation gates,
while Berry's phase itself is at the heart of the study of topological phases
of matter. The geometrical and topological properties of the phase space of
spin$-1$ quantum states is richer than that of spin$-1/2$ quantum states and is
relatively unexplored. For instance, the spin vector of a spin-1 system, unlike
that of a spin$-1/2$ system, can lie anywhere on or inside the Bloch sphere
representing the phase space. Recently, a generalization of Berry's phase that
encapsulates the topology of spin-1 quantum states has been formulated in J.
Math. Phys., 59(6), 062105. This geometric phase includes loops that go inside
the Bloch sphere and is carried by the tensor of spin fluctuations, unlike
Berry's phase which is carried by the global phase of the quantum state.
Furthermore, due to a mathematical singularity at the center of the Bloch
sphere, the class of loops that pass through the center are called singular
loops and are significant because their geometric phase is non-Abelian. In
contrast with Berry's phase for spin$-1/2$ systems, whose properties come from
the topology of a sphere, the properties of singular loop geometric phases come
from the topology of the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, which is more
non-trivial. Here we use coherent control of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms in an
optical trap to experimentally explore this geometric phase for singular loops
in a spin-1 quantum system.

historical price-related data of the stocks to forecast their future trends. As
the Web information grows, recently some works try to explore financial news to
improve the prediction. Effective indicators, e.g., the events related to the
stocks and the people's sentiments towards the market and stocks, have been
proved to play important roles in the stocks' volatility, and are extracted to
feed into the prediction models for improving the prediction accuracy. However,
a major limitation of previous methods is that the indicators are obtained from
only a single source whose reliability might be low, or from several data
sources but their interactions and correlations among the multi-sourced data
are largely ignored.
  In this work, we extract the events from Web news and the users' sentiments
from social media, and investigate their joint impacts on the stock price
movements via a coupled matrix and tensor factorization framework.
Specifically, a tensor is firstly constructed to fuse heterogeneous data and
capture the intrinsic relations among the events and the investors' sentiments.
Due to the sparsity of the tensor, two auxiliary matrices, the stock
quantitative feature matrix and the stock correlation matrix, are constructed
and incorporated to assist the tensor decomposition. The intuition behind is
that stocks that are highly correlated with each other tend to be affected by
the same event. Thus, instead of conducting each stock prediction task
separately and independently, we predict multiple correlated stocks
simultaneously through their commonalities, which are enabled via sharing the
collaboratively factorized low rank matrices between matrices and the tensor.
Evaluations on the China A-share stock data and the HK stock data in the year
2015 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

always selecting the widest available channel normally maximizes the individual
long-term throughput, it often generates unfair situations where other WLANs
starve. Moreover, we show that there are scenarios where DCB with stochastic
channel width selection improves the latter approach both in terms of
individual throughput and fairness. It follows that there is not a unique
optimal DCB policy for every case. Instead, smarter bandwidth adaptation is
required in the challenging scenarios of next-generation WLANs.

diverse features of image stimuli such as semantic class, orientation, location

distance. Thus, we create a series of mock data sets of SEAMBHs, especially in
the high redshift region, to check their abilities to probe the cosmology. To
fulfill the potential of the SEAMBHs on the cosmology, we apply the simulated
data to three projects. The first is the exploration of their abilities to
constrain the cosmological parameters, in which we combine different data sets
of current observations such as the cosmic microwave background from {\it
Planck} and type Ia supernovae from Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA). We find
that the high redshift SEAMBHs can help to break the degeneracies of the
background cosmological parameters constrained by {\it Planck} and JLA, thus
giving much tighter constraints of the cosmological parameters. The second uses
the high redshift SEAMBHs as the complements of the low redshift JLA to
constrain the early expansion rate and the dark energy density evolution in the
cold dark matter frame. Our results show that these high redshift SEAMBHs are
very powerful on constraining the early Hubble rate and the evolution of the
dark energy density; thus they can give us more information about the expansion
history of our Universe, which is also crucial for testing the $\Lambda$CDM
model in the high redshift region. Finally, we check the SEAMBH candles'
abilities to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy at high redshift.
In summary, our results show that the SEAMBHs, as the rare candles in the high
redshift region, can provide us a new and independent observation to probe
cosmology in the future.

developments in image denoising to tackle other, more involved, imaging inverse
problems. In a PnP method, a black-box denoiser is plugged into an iterative
algorithm, taking the place of a formal denoising step that corresponds to the
proximity operator of some convex regularizer. While this approach offers
flexibility and excellent performance, convergence of the resulting algorithm
may be hard to analyze, as most state-of-the-art denoisers lack an explicit
underlying objective function. In this paper, we propose a PnP approach where a
scene-adapted prior (i.e., where the denoiser is targeted to the specific scene
being imaged) is plugged into ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers), and prove convergence of the resulting algorithm. Finally, we
apply the proposed framework in two different imaging inverse problems:
hyperspectral sharpening/fusion and image deblurring from blurred/noisy image

tradeoff of a wiretap erasure broadcast channel (BC) with Kw weak receivers and
Ks strong receivers, where weak receivers, respectively strong receivers, have
same erasure probabilities and cache sizes. The lower bounds are achieved by
schemes that meticulously combine joint cache-channel coding with wiretap
coding and key-aided one-time pads. The presented upper bound holds more
generally for arbitrary degraded BCs and arbitrary cache sizes. When only weak
receivers have cache memories, upper and lower bounds coincide for small and
large cache memories, thus providing the exact secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff
for this setup. The derived bounds allow to further conclude that the secrecy
capacity is positive even when the eavesdropper is stronger than all the
legitimate receivers with cache memories. Moreover, they show that the secrecy
capacity-memory tradeoff can be significantly smaller than its non-secure
counterpart, but it grows much faster when cache memories are small. The paper
also presents a lower bound on the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff
where one is allowed to optimize the cache assignment subject to a total cache
budget. It is close to the best known lower bound without secrecy constraint.
For small total cache budget, the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff is
achieved by assigning all the available cache memory uniformly over all
receivers if the eavesdropper is stronger than all legitimate receivers, and it
is achieved by assigning the cache memory uniformly only over the weak
receivers if the eavesdropper is weaker than the strong receivers.

multi-objective optimization (EMO). A decomposition-based EMO algorithm is
usually designed to approximate a whole Pareto-optimal front (PF). However, in
practice, the decision maker (DM) might only be interested in her/his region of
interest (ROI), i.e., a part of the PF. Solutions outside that might be useless
or even noisy to the decision-making procedure. Furthermore, there is no
guarantee to find the preferred solutions when tackling many-objective
problems. This paper develops an interactive framework for the
decomposition-based EMO algorithm to lead a DM to the preferred solutions of
her/his choice. It consists of three modules, i.e., consultation, preference
elicitation and optimization. Specifically, after every several generations,
the DM is asked to score a few candidate solutions in a consultation session.
Thereafter, an approximated value function, which models the DM's preference
information, is progressively learned from the DM's behavior. In the preference
elicitation session, the preference information learned in the consultation
module is translated into the form that can be used in a decomposition-based
EMO algorithm, i.e., a set of reference points that are biased toward to the
ROI. The optimization module, which can be any decomposition-based EMO
algorithm in principle, utilizes the biased reference points to direct its
search process. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems with three to ten
objectives fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for
finding the DM's preferred solutions.

in ohmic plasmas and in edge localized mode-free and enhanced D-alpha high

exponential shape with comparable temporal scales and asymmetry, while the
burst amplitudes and the waiting times between them are exponentially

densities are self-similar for all these confinement modes. These results are
strong evidence in support of a stochastic model describing the plasma

distributions with respect to the two angles, determining electron direction at
a given shower age, for a fixed electron energy and lateral distance, are
universal. It means that the distributions do not depend on the primary
particle energy or mass (thus, neither on the interaction model), shower zenith
angle or shower to shower fluctuations, if they are taken at the same shower
age. Together with previous work showing the universality of the distributions
of the electron energy, of the lateral distance (integrated over angles) and of
the angle (integrated over lateral distance) for fixed electron energy this
paper completes a full universal description of the electron states at various
shower ages. Analytical parametrizations of the full electron states are given.
It is also shown that some distributions can be described by a smaller than
five numbers of variables, the new ones being products of the old ones raised
to some powers. The accuracy of the present parametrization is sufficiently
good for applying to showers with the primary energy uncertainty of 14% (as it
is at the Pierre Auger Observatory). The shower fluctuations in the chosen bins
of the multidimensional variable space are about 6%, determining the minimum
uncertainty needed for parametrization of the universal distributions. An
analytical way of estimation of the effect of the geomagnetic field is given.
Thanks to the universality of the electron distributions in any shower a new
method of shower reconstruction can be worked out from data of the
observatories using the fluorescence technique. The light fluxes (both
fluorescence and Cherenkov) for any shower age can be exactly predicted for a
shower with any primary energy and shower maximum depth, so that the two
quantities can be obtained by best fitting the predictions to the measurements

or specular. Specular Andreev reflection (SAR) dominates when the position of
the Fermi energy in graphene is comparable to or smaller than the
superconducting gap. Bilayer graphene (BLG) is an ideal candidate to observe
the crossover from retro to specular since the Fermi energy broadening near the
Dirac point is much weaker compared to monolayer graphene. Recently, the
observation of signatures of SAR in BLG have been reported experimentally by
looking at the enhancement of conductance at finite bias near the Dirac point.
However, the signatures were not very pronounced possibly due to the
participation of normal quasi-particles at bias energies close to the
superconducting gap. Here, we propose a scheme to observe the features of
enhanced SAR even at zero bias at a normal metal (NM)-superconductor (SC)
junction on BLG. Our scheme involves applying a Zeeman field to the NM side of
the NM-SC junction on BLG (making the NM ferromagnetic), which energetically
separates the Dirac points for up-spin and down-spin. We calculate the
conductance as a function of chemical potential and bias within the
superconducting gap and show that well-defined regions of specular- and
retro-type Andreev reflection exist. We compare the results with and without
superconductivity. We also investigate the possibility of the formation of a
p-n junction at the interface between the NM and SC due to a work function
mismatch.

However, spin-related phenomena of such condensates are difficult to explore
due to the relatively small Zeeman effect of standard semiconductor microcavity
systems and the strong tendency to sustain an equal population of two spin
components, which precludes the observation of condensates with a well defined
spin projection along the axis of the system. The enhancement of the Zeeman
splitting can be achieved by introducing magnetic ions to the quantum wells,
and consequently forming semimagnetic polaritons. In this system, increasing
magnetic field can induce polariton condensation at constant excitation power.
Here we evidence the spin polarization of a semimagnetic polaritons condensate
exhibiting a circularly polarized emission over 95% even in a moderate magnetic
field of about 3 T. Furthermore, we show that unlike nonmagnetic polaritons, an
increase on excitation power results in an increase of the semimagnetic

designing such a model, is to exploit the local linguistic context in clinical
text and enable intra-sequence interaction, in order to jointly learn to
classify drug and disease entities, and to extract adverse reactions caused by
a given drug. Our model makes use of a self-attention mechanism to facilitate

charge-ordering could also achieve electronic ferroelectricity at the same
critical temperature $T_{co}$. A prototype of such phenomenon are the quasi-one
dimensional (TMTTF)$_2X$ Fabre-salts. However, the stabilization of a
long-range ferroelectric ground-state below $T_{co}$ requires the break of
inversion symmetry, which should be accompanied by a lattice deformation. In
this work we investigate the role of the monovalent counter-anion $X$ in such
mechanism. For this purpose, we measured the quasi-static dielectric constant
along the $c^{*}$-axis direction, where layers formed by donors and anions
alternate. Our findings show that the ionic charge contribution is three orders
of magnitude lower than the intra-stack electronic response. The $c^{*}$
dielectric constant ($\epsilon'_{c^*}$) probes directly the charge response of
the monovalent anion $X$, since the anion mobility in the structure should help
to stabilize the ferroelectric ground-state. Furthermore, our $\epsilon'_{c^*}$
measurements %conjugated with earlier investigations of the $c^*$ lattice
thermal expansion, show that the dielectric response is thermally broaden below
$T_{co}$ if the ferroelectric transition occurs in the temperature range where
the anion movement begin to freeze in their methyl groups cavity. In the
extreme case of the PF$_6$-H$_{12}$ salt, where $T_{co}$ occurs at the freezing
point, a relaxor-type ferroelectricity is observed. Also, because of the slow
kinetics of the anion sub-lattice, global hysteresis effects and reduction of
the charge response upon successive cycling are observed. In this context, we
propose that anions control the order-disorder or relaxation character of the
ferroelectric transition of the Fabre-salts.

fail when the units to match are text documents: the high-dimensional and rich
nature of the data renders exact matching infeasible, causes propensity scores
to produce incomparable matches, and makes assessing match quality difficult.
In this paper, we characterize a framework for matching text documents that
decomposes existing methods into: (1) the choice of text representation, and
(2) the choice of distance metric. We investigate how different choices within
this framework affect both the quantity and quality of matches identified
through a systematic multifactor evaluation experiment using human subjects.
Altogether we evaluate over 100 unique text matching methods along with 5
comparison methods taken from the literature. Our experimental results identify
methods that generate matches with higher subjective match quality than current
state-of-the-art techniques. We enhance the precision of these results by
developing a predictive model to estimate the match quality of pairs of text
documents as a function of our various distance scores. This model, which we
find successfully mimics human judgment, also allows for approximate and
unsupervised evaluation of new procedures. We then employ the identified best
method to illustrate the utility of text matching in two applications. First,
we engage with a substantive debate in the study of media bias by using text
matching to control for topic selection when comparing news articles from
thirteen news sources. We then show how conditioning on text data leads to more
precise causal inferences in an observational study examining the effects of a

uncorrelated at all temperatures, like in a perfect paramagnet. The addition of
nearest neighbors interactions favoring neutral `2in-2out' excitations as a

increasing temperature. This helps us understand why dipolar correlations are
observed in spin ices at unexpectedly high temperatures, and the major role of
double excitations in erasing the Coulomb phase correlations. Ferromagnetic
interactions strengthen the charges short range order and its associated spin
correlations. Finally, we discuss how the monopole liquid can be related to
other systems and materials where different phases of \emph{monopole matter}

stratosphere of Jupiter via photolysis of methane (CH$_4$). Despite this common
source, the latitudinal distribution of the two species is radically different,
with acetylene decreasing in abundance towards the pole, and ethane increasing
towards the pole. We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared
observations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane.
We confirm that the latitudinal distributions of ethane and acetylene are
decoupled, and that this is a persistent feature over multiple years. The
acetylene distribution falls off towards the pole, peaking at
$\sim$30$^{\circ}$N with a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of $\sim$0.8 parts per
million (ppm) at 1 mbar and still falling off at $\pm70^\circ$ with a VMR of
$\sim$0.3 ppm. The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we
move from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric
about the equator. We suggest that both the short term changes in acetylene and
its latitudinal asymmetry is driven by changes to the vertical stratospheric
mixing, potentially related to propagating wave phenomena. Unlike acetylene,
ethane has a symmetric distribution about the equator that increases toward the
pole, with a peak mole fraction of $\sim$18 ppm at about $\pm50^{\circ}$
latitude, with a minimum at the equator of $\sim$10 ppm at 1 mbar. [...] The
equator-to-pole distributions of acetylene and ethane are consistent with
acetylene having a shorter lifetime than ethane that is not sensitive to longer
advective timescales, but is augmented by short-term dynamics, such as vertical
mixing. Conversely, the long lifetime of ethane allows it to be transported to
higher latitudes faster than it can be chemically depleted.

if they provide only a small fraction of the dark matter. In particular, they
could generate cosmological structure either individually through through the
`seed' effect or collectively through the `Poisson' effect, thereby alleviating
some problems associated with the standard CDM scenario. If the PBHs all have a
similar mass and make a small contribution to the dark matter, then the seed
effect dominates on small scales, in which case PBHs could seed the
supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei or even galaxies themselves. If
they have a similar mass and provide the dark matter, the Poisson effect
dominates on all scales and the first bound clouds would form earlier than in
the usual scenario, with interesting observational consequences. If the PBHs
have an extended mass spectrum, which is more likely, they could fulfill all
three roles - providing the dark matter, binding the first bound clouds and
generating galaxies. In this case, the galactic mass function naturally has the
observed form, with the galaxy mass being simply related to the black hole

ultrastrong adhesion (up to theoretical strength) can be reached both in line
contact or in axisymmetric contact for thin layers (typically of nanoscale
size), which suggests a new possible strategy for ""optimal adhesion"". In
particular, in line contact adhesion enhancement occurs as an increase of the
actual pull-off force, while in axisymmetric case the latter is apparently very
close to the classical JKR case. However, it appears in closer examination that
also for axisymmetric case, the enhancement occurs by reducing the size of
contact needed to sustain the pull-off force. These effects are further
enhanced by Poisson's ratio effects in the case of nearly incompressible layer.

models used for production optimization are subject to significant uncertainty.
To minimize the associated risk, the oil literature has mainly used
ensemble-based methods to optimize sample estimated risk measures of net
present value (NPV). However, the success in reducing risk critically depends
on the choice of risk measure. As a systematic approach to risk mitigation in
production optimization, this paper characterizes proper risk measures by the
axioms of coherence and aversion. As an example of a proper measure, we
consider conditional value-at-risk, $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$, at different risk
levels, $\alpha$. The potential of $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to minimize profit
loss is demonstrated by a simulated case study. The case study compares
$\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to real-world best practices, represented by reactive
control. It shows that for any risk level, $\alpha$, we may find an optimized
strategy that provides lower risk than reactive control. However, despite
overall lower risk, we see that all optimized strategies still yield some
unacceptable low profit realizations relative to reactive control. To remedy
this, we introduce a risk mitigation method based on the NPV offset
distribution. Unlike existing methods of the oil literature, the offset risk
mitigation approach minimizes the risk relative to a reference strategy
representing common real-life practices, e.g. reactive control. In the
simulated case study, we minimize the worst case profit offset to reduce the
risk of realizations that do worse than the reactive strategy. The results
suggest that it may be more relevant to consider the NPV offset distribution
than the NPV distribution when minimizing risk in production optimization.

which govern the resultant SED. This significantly improves the convergence
time and eliminates the uncertainty regarding the initial guess parameters.

substrate penetrate the film and emerge from the superstrate, creating a
superposition of two SPP waves, that leads to a beat interference envelope with
well-defined loci which are the function of both the drive frequency and the
dielectric constant of the substrate/superstrate. As the film thickness is
reduced to the SPP's penetration depth, surface waves from optically denser
dielectric/metal interface would dominate, leading to volume plasmons that
propagate inside the film at optical frequencies. Interference of periodic
volume charge density with the incident field over the film creates charge
bundles that are periodic in space and time.

that the strain has negligible effect on the conductivity of the materials; the

uniaxial strain along the armchair direction. Compressive strain always
increases the electronic transport in the systems due to stronger overlap of
the atomic orbitals. Our results show that the optical spectra are anisotropic

transition contributions along in-plane polarization are not negligible, by
considering this effect the optical properties of Ca2N and Sr2N sheets in the

charged particles observed in-situ in the heliosphere. However, the
acceleration of near-relativistic electrons by shocks in the interplanetary
medium is often questioned. On 9 August 2011 a Corotating Interaction Region
(CIR) passed STEREO B (STB) that resulted in a flux increase in the electron
and ion channels of the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT). Because
electron measurements in the few keV to several 100 keV range rely on the
so-called magnet foil technique, which is utilized by SEPT, ions can contribute
to the electron channels. Aims. We aim to investigate whether the flux increase
in the electron channels of SEPT during the CIR event on 9 August 2011 is
caused by ion contamination only. Methods. We compute the SEPT response
functions for protons and helium utilizing an updated GEANT4 model of SEPT. The
CIR energetic particle ion spectra for protons and helium are assumed to follow
a Band function in energy per nucleon with a constant helium to proton ratio.
Results. Our analysis leads to a helium to proton ratio of 16.9% and a proton
flux following a Band function with the parameters $I_0 = 1.24 \cdot 10^4$ /
(cm2 s sr MeV/nuc.), $E_c = 79$ keV/nuc. and spectral indices of $\gamma_1 =
-0.94$ and $\gamma_2 = -3.80$ which are in good agreement with measurements by
the Suprathermal Ion Telescope (SIT) aboard STB. Conclusions. Since our results
explain the SEPT measurements, we conclude that no significant amount of
electrons were accelerated between $55$ keV and $425$ keV by the CIR.

are a well-studied class of maps from $n\times n$ matrices to $m\times m$

of matrices is equivalent to a multitude of problems in computer science and
mathematics, such rational identity testing in non-commuting variables,
noncommutative rank of symbolic matrices, and a basic problem in invariant
theory (Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira and Wigderson, FOCS, 2016).
  We study operator scaling with specified marginals, which is the operator
analogue of scaling matrices to specified row and column sums. We characterize
the operators which can be scaled to given marginals, much in the spirit of the
Gurvits' algorithmic characterization of the operators that can be scaled to
doubly stochastic (Gurvits, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2004). Our
algorithm produces approximate scalings in time poly(n,m) whenever scalings
exist. A central ingredient in our analysis is a reduction from the specified
marginals setting to the doubly stochastic setting.
  Operator scaling with specified marginals arises in diverse areas of study
such as the Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, communication complexity, eigenvalues
of sums of Hermitian matrices, and quantum information theory. Some of the
known theorems in these areas, several of which had no effective proof, are
straightforward consequences of our characterization theorem. For instance, we
obtain a simple algorithm to find, when they exist, a tuple of Hermitian
matrices with given spectra whose sum has a given spectrum. We also prove new
theorems such as a generalization of Forster's theorem (Forster, Journal of

propose to have centralized network functions in the 5G network core to control
the network, end-to-end. This is achieved by relocating the control
functionality present in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) to the network core,
resulting in the conversion of the base station known as the gNB into a pure
data plane node. This brings about a significant reduction in signaling costs
between the RAN and the core network. It also results in improved system
performance. The merits of our proposal have been illustrated by evaluating the
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the 5G network, such as network attach
(registration) time and handover time. We have also demonstrated improvements
in attach time and system throughput due to the use of centralized algorithms
for mobility management with the help of ns-3 simulations.

  Approximation","SDM 2018 (Full version including all proofs)",,,,"cs.SI cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph embedding has been proven to be efficient and effective in facilitating
graph analysis. In this paper, we present a novel spectral framework called
NOn-Backtracking Embedding (NOBE), which offers a new perspective that
organizes graph data at a deep level by tracking the flow traversing on the
edges with backtracking prohibited. Further, by analyzing the non-backtracking
process, a technique called graph approximation is devised, which provides a
channel to transform the spectral decomposition on an edge-to-edge matrix to
that on a node-to-node matrix. Theoretical guarantees are provided by bounding
the difference between the corresponding eigenvalues of the original graph and
its graph approximation. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-world
networks demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on both macroscopic and
microscopic levels, including clustering and structural hole spanner detection.

pedagogy, but there is limited understanding of the possible presentation
styles. In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from a
direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera and screencasts
with voice-over, up to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work
evaluated the effectiveness of several presentation styles, but there has not
been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and
meta-analyses possible. In this article, we surveyed the research literature
and we examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by
diverse educational organizations and teachers across various academic
disciplines. We organized video lectures in two dimensions according to the
level of human presence and according to the type of instructional media. In
addition to organizing existing video lectures in a comprehensive way, the
proposed taxonomy offers a design space that facilitates the choice of a
suitable presentation style, as well as the preparation of new ones.

material was successfully synthesized by the solvent-phase reaction. Motivated
by this experimental effort, we conducted extensive first-principles density
functional theory simulations to explore the application prospects of CEY as an
anode material for Mg, Na and Li-ion batteries. To simulate the ionic
intercalation process in an anode electrode, the adatoms coverage was gradually
increased. We then employed Bader charge analysis to evaluate the charge
transfer between the adatoms and the CEY nanosheet and finally to report the
theoretical storage capacity of the anode. We particularly studied the
evolution of adsorption energy, electronic density of states and open-circuit
voltage with respect to adatoms coverage. The diffusion of an adatom over the
CEY surface was also investigated by using the nudged elastic band method.
Remarkably, our results suggest CEY as a promising anode material containing
the highest theoretical charge capacities among 2D materials studied so far,
with ultrahigh capacities of 2,680 mAh/g and 1,788 mAh/g for Li and Na-ion
batteries, respectively. The provided insight by this study highlights the CEY
as a novel full carbon material with properties, highly desirable for the
application as anode material in the next generation rechargeable ion
batteries.

methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) is proposed as an alternative method to enhance the
voltage stability. A simplified semi-empirical model is firstly developed to
describe I-V relationships based on uniform-designed experiments. It is then
embedded into multi-objective optimizations to construct the adaptive operation
strategy. Experimental studies are implemented on different DMFC systems to
validate the proposed semi-empirical model, control strategy and system
response to operational adjustments. Numerical simulations are also performed
to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the proposed adaptive operation
strategy. The results show that the adaptive operation strategy provides
possibilities for voltage stability enhancement without the sacrifice of energy
conversion efficiency. The adaptive operations are also found to be able to
extend the range of operating current density or to decrease the voltage
deviation according to one's requirements. Moreover, the response of DMFCs to
operational adjustments is quick, which further validates the effectiveness and
feasibility of the adaptive operation strategy in practical applications. The
proposed strategy contributes to a guideline for the better control of output
voltage from operating DMFC systems.
