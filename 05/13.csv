averaging technique that tends to improve generalization in large scale models

improving predictive uncertainty in classification problems, based on Dropout

observed collective flow at RHIC and LHC, the momentum anisotropy is present at
almost all the stages after the collision and therefore, it is important to
include its effects in the analysis. Employing the in-medium (corrected)
potential while considering the anisotropy (both oblate and prolate cases) in
the medium, the thermal widths and the binding energies of the heavy quarkonia

modified the potential and then the thermal widths and the binding energies of
these states in a significant manner. The results show a quite visible shift in
the values of dissociation temperatures as compared to the isotropic case.
Further, the hot QCD medium interaction effects suppress the dissociation

applies for worst-case graphs and applies to all of the above optimization

upper bound on the readability of a bipartite graph (following from a work of
Braga and Meidanis, LATIN 2002) is exponential in the maximum degree of the
graph.
  Graphs that arise in bioinformatic applications have low readability. In this
paper, we focus on graph families with readability $o(n)$, where $n$ is the
number of vertices. We show that the readability of $n$-vertex bipartite chain
graphs is between $\Omega(\log n)$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$. We give an efficiently
testable characterization of bipartite graphs of readability at most $2$ and
completely determine the readability of grids, showing in particular that their
readability never exceeds $3$. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial time
algorithm to determine the readability of induced subgraphs of grids. One of
the highlights of our techniques is the appearance of Euler's totient function
in the analysis of the readability of bipartite chain graphs. We also develop a
new technique for proving lower bounds on readability, which is applicable to
dense graphs with a large number of distinct degrees.

fade. It is widely noted that our social embedding exerts a strong influence on
what information we receive and how we form beliefs and make decisions.
However, most empirical studies on the role of social networks in collective
intelligence have overlooked the dynamic nature of social networks and its role
in fostering adaptive collective intelligence. It remains unknown (1) how
network structures adapt to the attributes of individuals, and (2) whether this
adaptation promotes the accuracy of individual and collective decisions. Here,
we answer these questions through a series of behavioral experiments and
supporting simulations. Our results reveal that social network plasticity in
the presence of feedback, can adapt to biased and changing information
environments, and produce collective estimates that are more accurate than
their best-performing member. We explore two mechanisms that explain these
results: (1) a global adaptation mechanism where the structural connectivity of
the network itself changes such that it amplifies the estimates of
high-performing members within the group; (2) a local adaptation mechanism
where accurate individuals are more resistant to social influence, and
therefore their initial belief is weighted in the collective estimate
disproportionately. Thereby, our findings substantiate the role of social
network plasticity and feedback as adaptive mechanisms for refining individual
and collective judgments.

hijacking attacks, and consequently code reuse attacks, are significantly more
difficult. CFI limits control flow to well-known locations, severely
restricting arbitrary code execution. Assessing the remaining attack surface of
an application under advanced control-flow hijack defenses such as CFI and
shadow stacks remains an open problem.
  We introduce BOPC, a mechanism to automatically assess whether an attacker
can execute arbitrary code on a binary hardened with CFI/shadow stack defenses.
BOPC computes exploits for a target program from payload specifications written
in a Turing-complete, high-level language called SPL that abstracts away
architecture and program-specific details. SPL payloads are compiled into a
program trace that executes the desired behavior on top of the target binary.
The input for BOPC is an SPL payload, a starting point (e.g., from a fuzzer
crash) and an arbitrary memory write primitive that allows application state
corruption. To map SPL payloads to a program trace, BOPC introduces Block
Oriented Programming (BOP), a new code reuse technique that utilizes entire
basic blocks as gadgets along valid execution paths in the program, i.e.,
without violating CFI or shadow stack policies. We find that the problem of
mapping payloads to program traces is NP-hard, so BOPC first reduces the search
space by pruning infeasible paths and then uses heuristics to guide the search
to probable paths. BOPC encodes the BOP payload as a set of memory writes.
  We execute 13 SPL payloads applied to 10 popular applications. BOPC
successfully finds payloads and complex execution traces -- which would likely
not have been found through manual analysis -- while following the target's
Control-Flow Graph under an ideal CFI policy in 81% of the cases.

in the K2 space mission Campaign 8 field with a transiting super-Earth. The
planet has recently been validated as well. Our aim was to confirm the
detection and derive the main physical characteristics of K2-216b, including
the mass. We performed a series of follow-up observations: high resolution
imaging with the FastCam camera at the TCS, the Infrared Camera and
Spectrograph at Subaru, and high resolution spectroscopy with HARPS (ESO, La
Silla), HARPS-N (TNG), and FIES (NOT). The stellar spectra were analyzed with
the SpecMatch-Emp and SME codes to derive the stellar fundamental properties.
We analyzed the K2 light curve with the Pyaneti software. The radial-velocity
measurements were modelled with both a Gaussian process (GP) regression and the
floating chunk offset (FCO) technique to simultaneously model the planetary
signal and correlated noise associated with stellar activity. Imaging confirms
that K2-216 is a single star. Our analysis discloses that the star is a
moderately active K5V star of mass 0.70+/-0.03 Msun and radius 0.72+/-0.03
Rsun. Planet b is found to have a radius of 1.75+0.17-0.10 Rearth and a
2.17-day orbit in agreement with previous results. We find consistent results
for the planet mass from both models: 7.4+/-2.2 Mearth from the GP regression,
and 8.0+/-1.6 Mearth from the FCO technique, which implies that this planet is
a super-Earth. The planet parameters put planet b in the middle of, or just
below, the gap of the radius distribution of small planets. The density is
consistent with a rocky composition of primarily iron and magnesium silicate.
In agreement with theoretical predictions, we find that the planet is a remnant
core, stripped of its atmosphere, and is one of the largest planets found that
has lost its atmosphere.

customer, the seller offers an assortment of substitutable products and
customer makes the purchase among offered products according to an
uncapacitated multinomial logit (MNL) model. Since all the utility parameters
of MNL are unknown, the seller needs to simultaneously learn customers' choice
behavior and make dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current
knowledge. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or
equivalently, to minimize the expected regret. Although dynamic assortment
planning problem has received an increasing attention in revenue management,
most existing policies require the estimation of mean utility for each product
and the final regret usually involves the number of products $N$. The optimal
regret of the dynamic assortment planning problem under the most basic and
popular choice model---MNL model is still open. By carefully analyzing a
revenue potential function, we develop a trisection based policy combined with
adaptive confidence bound construction, which achieves an {item-independent}
regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the length of selling horizon. We
further establish the matching lower bound result to show the optimality of our
policy. There are two major advantages of the proposed policy. First, the
regret of all our policies has no dependence on $N$. Second, our policies are
almost assumption free: there is no assumption on mean utility nor any
""separability"" condition on the expected revenues for different assortments.
Our result also extends the unimodal bandit literature.

model of high-$p_\perp$ parton interactions with QGP. We here report a major
step of introducing medium evolution in the formalism though $1+1D$ Bjorken
(``B'') expansion, while preserving all complex features of the original
dynamical energy loss framework. We use this framework to provide joint
$R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ predictions, for the first time within the dynamical energy
loss formalism in evolving QCD medium. The predictions are generated for a wide
range of observables, i.e. for all types of probes (both light and heavy) and
for all centrality regions in both $Pb+Pb$ and $Xe+Xe$ collisions at the LHC.
Where experimental data are available, DREENA-B framework leads to a good joint
agreement with $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data. Such agreement is encouraging, i.e. may
lead us closer to resolving $v_2$ puzzle (difficulty of previous models to
jointly explain $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data), though this still remains to be
thoroughly tested by including state-of-the-art medium evolution within DREENA
framework. While introducing medium evolution significantly changes $v_2$
predictions, $R_{AA}$ predictions remain robust and moreover in a good
agreement with the experimental data; $R_{AA}$ observable is therefore suitable
for calibrating parton-medium interaction model, independently from the medium
evolution. Finally, for heavy flavor, we observe a strikingly similar signature
of the dead-cone effect on both $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ - we also provide a simple
analytical understanding behind this result. Overall, the results presented
here indicate that DREENA framework is a reliable tool for QGP tomography.

usually diffuse spatially and directionally. Exploiting this fact, we propose a
method that synthesizes the directional impulse response between any source and
listening locations by combining a synthesized early reverberation part and a
measured late reverberation tail. The early reverberation is simulated using a
geometric acoustic simulation and then enhanced using a frequency modulation
method to capture room resonances. The late reverberation is extracted from a
recorded impulse response, with a carefully chosen time duration that separates
out the late reverberation from the early reverberation. In our validations, we
show that our synthesized spatial audio matches closely with recordings using
ambisonic microphones. Lastly, we demonstrate the strength of our method in

lock-free concurrent search data structures. Our analysis considers such
lock-free data structures that are utilized through a sequence of operations
which are generated with a memoryless and stationary access pattern. Our main
contribution is a new way of analysing lock-free search data structures: our
execution model matches with the behavior that we observe in practice and
achieves good throughput predictions. Search data structures are formed of
linked basic blocks, usually referred as nodes, that can be accessed by two
kinds of events, characterized by their latencies; (i) CAS events originated as
a result of modifications of the search data structures (ii) Read events
originated during traversals. This type of data structures are usually designed
to accommodate a large number of data nodes, which makes the occurrence of an
event on a given node rare at any given time. The throughput is defined by the
number of events per operation in conjunction with the factors that impact the
latencies of these events. We frame these impacting factors under capacity and
coherence cache misses.
  In this context, we model the events as Poisson processes that we can merge
and split to estimate the latencies of the events based on the interleaving of
events from different threads, and in turn estimate the throughput. We have
validated our analysis on several fundamental lock-free search data structures
such as linked lists, hash tables, skip lists and binary trees.

is studied as a model for gravity in both classical and quantum frameworks. Its
dynamical variables are a canonical conjugate pair of real symmetric
three-index tensors, and a question in this model was how to extract spacetime
pictures from the tensors. We give such an extraction procedure by using two
techniques widely known in data analysis. One is the tensor-rank (or CP, etc.)
decomposition, which is a certain generalization of the singular value
decomposition of a matrix and decomposes a tensor into a number of vectors. By
regarding the vectors as points forming a space, topological properties can be
extracted by using the other data analysis technique called persistent
homology, and geometries by virtual diffusion processes over points. Thus, time
evolutions of the tensors in the CTM can be interpreted as topological and
geometric evolutions of spaces. We have performed some initial investigations
of the classical equation of motion of the CTM in terms of these techniques for
a homogeneous fuzzy circle and homogeneous two- and three-dimensional fuzzy
spheres as spaces, and have obtained agreement with the general relativistic
system obtained previously in a formal continuum limit of the CTM. It is also
demonstrated by some concrete examples that the procedure is general for any

antimagic if it is a bijection $f:E \to\{1,\ldots ,|E|\}$ such that for any
pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$, $f^+(x)\not= f^+(y)$, where the induced
vertex label $f^+(x)= \sum f(e)$, with $e$ ranging over all the edges incident
to $x$. The local antimagic chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{la}(G)$,
is the minimum number of distinct induced vertex labels over all local
antimagic labelings of $G$. In this paper, the sharp lower bound of the local
antimagic chromatic number of a graph with cut-vertices given by pendants is
obtained. The exact value of the local antimagic chromatic number of many
families of graphs with cut-vertices (possibly given by pendant edges) are also
determined. Consequently, we partially answered Problem 3.1 in [Local antimagic

to a new domain for which only a domain description is provided and no training

proposed. This algorithm can learn a cross-domain embedding space that models
the semantics of dialog responses which, in turn, lets a neural dialog

inference attacks, in which an attacker leverages a machine learning classifier
to infer a target user's private attributes (e.g., location, sexual
orientation, political view) from its public data (e.g., rating scores, page
likes). Existing defenses leverage game theory or heuristics based on
correlations between the public data and attributes. These defenses are not
practical. Specifically, game-theoretic defenses require solving intractable
optimization problems, while correlation-based defenses incur large utility
loss of users' public data.
  In this paper, we present AttriGuard, a practical defense against attribute
inference attacks. AttriGuard is computationally tractable and has small
utility loss. Our AttriGuard works in two phases. Suppose we aim to protect a
user's private attribute. In Phase I, for each value of the attribute, we find
a minimum noise such that if we add the noise to the user's public data, then
the attacker's classifier is very likely to infer the attribute value for the
user. We find the minimum noise via adapting existing evasion attacks in
adversarial machine learning. In Phase II, we sample one attribute value
according to a certain probability distribution and add the corresponding noise
found in Phase I to the user's public data. We formulate finding the
probability distribution as solving a constrained convex optimization problem.
We extensively evaluate AttriGuard and compare it with existing methods using a
real-world dataset. Our results show that AttriGuard substantially outperforms
existing methods. Our work is the first one that shows evasion attacks can be
used as defensive techniques for privacy protection.

Babcock--Leighton dynamo model. In this model, based on the toroidal flux at
the base of the convection zone, bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) are produced
with statistical properties obtained from observed distributions. We find that
a little quenching in BMR tilt is sufficient to stabilize the dynamo growth.
The randomness and nonlinearity in the BMR emergences make the poloidal field
unequal and cause some variability in the solar cycle. However, when observed
scatter of BMR tilts around Joy's law with a standard deviation of $15^\circ$,
is considered, our model produces a variation in the solar cycle, including
north-south asymmetry comparable to the observations. The morphology of
magnetic fields closely resembles observations, in particular the surface
radial field possesses a more mixed polarity field. Observed scatter also
produces grand minima. In 11,650 years of simulation, 17 grand minima are
detected and $11\%$ of its time the model remained in these grand minima. When
we double the tilt scatter, the model produces correct statistics of grand
minima. Importantly, the dynamo continues even during grand minima with only a
few BMRs, without requiring any additional alpha effect. The reason for this is
the downward magnetic pumping which suppresses the diffusion of the magnetic
flux across the surface. The magnetic pumping also helps to achieve 11-year
magnetic cycle using the observed BMR flux distribution, even at the high
diffusivity.

$D:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}~:~|z|\le 1\}$ (disk), under the normalization condition
that the zeroes of the polynomial in question all lie in $I$ or $D$,
respectively. For the maximum norm he found that with $n:=\mathop{\mathrm{deg}}

derivative norm is $\sqrt{n}$ for $I$ and $n$ for $D$.
  J. Er\H{o}d continued the work of Tur\'an considering other domains. Finally,
a decade ago the growth of the minimal possible $\infty$-norm of the derivative
was proved to be of order $n$ for all compact convex domains.
  Although Tur\'an himself gave comments about the above oscillation question
in $L^q$ norms, till recently results were known only for $D$ and $I$.
Recently, we have found order $n$ lower estimations for several general classes

domains the growth order of this quantity should be $n$. Now we prove that in
$L^q$ norm the oscillation order is at least $n/\log n$ for all compact convex
domains.

eruptions of ILs are an important source of CMEs. It is generally believed that
ILs are formed through magnetic reconnection in the high corona (>150-200""),

that ILs are formed by gradual reconnection high in the corona, in line with

the first protocol that solves this problem in sublinear time. The protocol
converges in $O(\log n \log \log n)$ time and uses $O(n^{60})$ states ($O(1) +
60 \log n$ bits of memory per agent) with probability $1-O(\frac{\log \log

The time to converge is also $O(\log n \log \log n)$ in expectation. Crucially,
unlike most published protocols with $\omega(1)$ states, our protocol is
_uniform_: it uses the same transition algorithm for any population size, so
does not need an estimate of the population size to be embedded into the
algorithm. A sub-protocol is the first uniform sublinear-time leader election
population protocol, taking $O(\log n \log \log n)$ time and $O(n^{18})$
states. The state complexity of both the counting and leader election protocols
can be reduced to $O(n^{30})$ and $O(n^{9})$ respectively, while increasing the

knowledge of the number of participating nodes and the range of possible IDs,

These are very strong assumptions for models which were designed to capture
networks of weak devices organized in an ad-hoc manner. It was believed that
without this knowledge, deterministic algorithms must necessarily be much less
efficient.
  In this paper we address this fundamental question and show that this is not

(in which nodes know only their own IDs), which match or nearly match the
running times of the fastest algorithms which assume network knowledge (and
even surpass the previous fastest algorithms which assume parameter knowledge
but not small labels).
  Specifically, in multiple access channels with $k$ participating nodes and
IDs up to $L$, we give a wake-up algorithm requiring $O(\frac{k\log L \log k

yields - in the continuum limit - a representation which is highly
discontinuous and hence unphysical. Here we show that the same issue arises
generically when considering tree tensor networks: the set of coarse-graining
maps yielding discontinuous representations has full measure in the set of all

algorithms, however, assume that devices have some network knowledge (usually
bounds on the number of nodes in the network $n$, and the diameter $D$), which
may not always be realistic in systems with weak devices or gradual deployment.
Very little is known about what can be done when this information is not
available.
  This is the issue we address in this work, by presenting the first
\emph{randomized} broadcasting algorithms for \emph{blind} networks in which
nodes have no prior knowledge whatsoever. We demonstrate that lack of parameter
knowledge can be overcome at only a small increase in running time.
Specifically, we show that in networks without collision detection, broadcast
can be achieved in $O(D\log\frac nD\log^2\log\frac nD + \log^2 n)$ time, almost
reaching the $\Omega(D\log\frac nD + \log^2 n)$ lower bound. We also give an
algorithm for directed networks with collision detection, which requires only
$O(D\log\frac nD\log\log\log\frac nD + \log^2 n)$ time.

Besides, we consider a non-tangential maximal function associated with the

Our methods are based on the use of extrapolation for Muckenhoupt weights and
change of angle estimates. All our results are obtained in the general setting
of a degenerate elliptic operator, where the degeneracy is given by an $A_2$

the software corrects for instrumental artifacts. Then, it uses the speckle
calibration tool (SpeCal) to minimize the stellar light halo that prevents us
from detecting faint sources like exoplanets or circumstellar disks. SpeCal is
meant to extract the astrometry and photometry of detected point-like sources
(exoplanets, brown dwarfs, or background sources). SpeCal was intensively
tested to ensure the consistency of all reduced images (cADI, Loci, TLoci, PCA,

accuracy of the astrometry and photometry of detected point-like sources.
SpeCal is robust, user friendly, and efficient at detecting and characterizing
point-like sources in high contrast images. It is used to process all SPHERE
data systematically, and its outputs have been used for most of the SPHERE
consortium papers to date. SpeCal is also a useful framework to compare
different algorithms using various sets of data (different observing modes and

spin susceptibility at zero temperature, providing a mechanism for the
coexistence of pairing and magnetization. While these effects are negligible
for weak pairing, they become sizable at strong pairing. For the double

reduction for the fermion sector induced by the DBE just gives rise to the
Andreev-Bashkin drag effect, indicating a strong entrainment between the two

is systematically studied in the extended phase space. In this framework, the
cosmological constant is interpreted as a varying thermodynamic pressure, and
the black hole mass is identified with enthalpy. The throttling process is
essentially an isenthalpic (i.e., constant-mass) process for the KN-AdS black
holes. The Joule-Thomson coefficient, inversion temperature, inversion curve,
and isenthalpic curve are investigated in order, with both analytical and
numerical methods. It is found that there are no maximum inversion
temperatures, but only minimum ones that are around one half of the critical
temperatures of the KN-AdS black holes. Two characteristic masses are also
discussed to show the detailed features in the throttling behaviors of the
KN-AdS black holes.

unique possibility for local manipulation of magnetization at subpicosecond
time scales that is very promising for magnetic data processing and other
magnonics applications. One of the mechanisms of the optical manipulation is
related to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). Usually the IFE is observed in
crystals and magnetic films on a substrate. Here we demonstrate the IFE induced
by fs-laser pulses in the magnetic film inside the magnetophotonic crystal.
Spectral dependence of the IFE on the laser pulse wavelength in the band gap of
the magnetophotonic crystal has a sharp peak leading to a significant
enhancement of the IFE. This phenomenon is explained by strong confinement of
the electromagnetic energy and angular momentum within the magnetic film.
Calculated near field distribution of the IFE effective magnetic field
indicates its subwavelength localization within 30 nm along the film thickness.
These excited volumes can be shifted along the sample depth via e.g. changing
frequency of the laser pulses. The obtained results open a way for the new
applications in the areas of ultrafast spintronics and quantum information
processing.

the question about a possible connection between model unpredictability and

peak-dip-hump structure in the anti-nodal region below $T_{c}$ is the most
prominent non-BCS signature of the underdoped high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, in which
no coherent quasiparticle can be defined in the anti-nodal region above
$T_{c}$. The peak-dip-hump structure has been commonly interpreted as the
result of the coupling of the electron to some Bosonic mode. However, such an
electron-Boson coupling picture does not answer the question of \textit{why the
quasiparticle dispersion is so flat in the anti-nodal region}, a behavior
totally unexpected for Bogoliubov quasiparticle in a d-wave BCS superconductor.
Here we show that the sharp quasiparticle peak in the anti-nodal region should
be understood as a new pole in the electron Green's function generated by the
strong coupling of the electron to diffusive spin fluctuation around the
antiferromagnetic wave vector $\mathbf{Q}=(\pi,\pi)$, rather than a nearly free
Bogoliubov quasiparticle in a d-wave BCS superconductor. More specifically, we
find that the normal self-energy of the electron from the scattering with the
diffusive spin fluctuation manifests itself mainly as a level repulsion effect
and is responsible for the reduction of both the quasiparticle dispersion and
the quasiparticle dissipation rate in the anti-nodal region. We argue that the
peak-dip separation in the anti-nodal spectrum should not be interpreted as the
energy of the pairing glue.

exhibit a unique feature, and propose a challenge for current planetary
formation models. The tidal effect between a planet and its host star plays an
essential role in reconfiguring the final orbits of the short-period planets.
In this work, based on various initial Rayleigh distributions of the orbital
elements, the final semi-major axis distributions of the planets with a radius
$<$ 4 $R_\oplus$ after suffering tidal evolutions are investigated. Our
simulations have qualitatively revealed some statistical properties: the
semi-major axis and its peak value all increase with the increase of the
initial semi-major axis and eccentricity. For the case that the initial mean
semi-major axis is less than 0.1 au and the mean eccentricity is larger than
0.25, the results of numerical simulation are approximately consistent with the
observation. In addition, the effects of other parameters, such as the tidal
dissipation coefficient, stellar mass and planetary mass, etc., on the final
semi-major axis distribution after tidal evolution are all relatively small.
Based on the simulation results, we have tried to find some clues for the
formation mechanism of low-mass planets. We speculate that these low-mass
planets probably form in the far place of protoplanetary disk with a moderate
eccentricity via the type I migration, and it is also possible to form in situ.

rectangles into 3-dimensional space. In this paper, we study the Cartesian
magicness of various $(p,q,r)$-board by matrix approach involving magic squares

cloud data. This feature enables our method to work regardless the time of the
day and the lighting conditions.The proposed network structure employs dilated
convolutions to gradually increase the perceptive field as depth increases,
this helps to reduce the computation time by about 30%. The network input
consists of five perspective representations of the unorganized point cloud
data. The network outputs an objectness map and the bounding box offset values
for each point. Our experiments showed that using reflection, range, and the
position on each of the three axes helped to improve the location and
orientation of the output bounding box. We carried out quantitative evaluations
with the help of the KITTI dataset evaluation server. It achieved the fastest
processing speed among the other contenders, making it suitable for real-time
applications. We implemented and tested it on a real vehicle with a Velodyne
HDL-64 mounted on top of it. We achieved execution times as fast as 50 FPS
using desktop GPUs, and up to 10 FPS on a single Intel Core i5 CPU. The deploy
implementation is open-sourced and it can be found as a feature branch inside
the autonomous driving framework Autoware. Code is available at:

realized by traversing backtrack arrows and cycles between various stages. In
order to give a compact and effective representation of the features, the
standard early temporal integration is combined with other selection and

of the nonlinear correlation between this subset of features, determined by an

This is very rare in Dirac semi - metals, but is expected in clean conventional

widely studied in both fixed-agent repeated interaction setting and the static
social learning framework. However, two aspects of dynamics in real-world
multiagent scenarios are currently missing in existing works. First, the
network topologies can be dynamic where agents may change their connections
through rewiring during the course of interactions. Second, the game matrix
between each pair of agents may not be static and usually not known as a prior.
Both the network dynamic and game uncertainty increase the coordination
difficulty among agents. In this paper, we consider a multiagent dynamic social
learning environment in which each agent can choose to rewire potential
partners and interact with randomly chosen neighbors in each round. We propose
an optimal rewiring strategy for agents to select most beneficial peers to
interact with for the purpose of maximizing the accumulated payoff in repeated
interactions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of
our approach through comparing with benchmark strategies. The performance of
three representative learning strategies under our social learning framework
with our optimal rewiring is investigated as well.
