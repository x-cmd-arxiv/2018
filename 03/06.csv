DMSA-coated magnetic nanoparticles, in both colloidal dispersion and in powder
form. The individual iron oxide cores were composed of > 95% maghemite and
agglomerated to clusters. At room temperature the ensemble behaved as a
superparamagnet according to M\""ossbauer and magnetization measurements,
however, with clear signs of dipolar interactions at low temperatures. Analysis
of temperature-dependent AC susceptibility data in the superparamagnetic regime
indicates a tendency for dipolar coupled anticorrelations of the core moments
within the clusters. To resolve the directional correlations between the
particle moments we performed polarized small-angle neutron scattering and
determined the magnetic spin-flip cross-section of the powder in low magnetic
field at 300 K. We extract the underlying pair distance distribution function
of the magnetization vector field by an indirect Fourier transform of the
cross-section, and which suggests positive as well as negative correlations
between nearest neighbor moments, with anticorrelations clearly dominating for
next-nearest moments. These tendencies are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations
of such core-clusters.

magnetostriction anomaly, $dL/L = -1.8 \times 10^{-6}$, at $H^{*} = 31$ T hence
presumably marks the crossover to a fluctuating nematic phase with large

confirm a Fermi surface change at $H^*$ with the emergence of new orbits. By
analyzing the field-induced change in the crystal-field ground state, we
conclude that the in-plane Ce $4f$ hybridization is enhanced at $H^*$, carrying
the in-plane $f$-electron anisotropy to the Fermi surface. We argue that the

particle transverse-momentum ranges of $1<p_T^t<10$~GeV/$c$ and
$0.5<p_T^a<10$~GeV/$c$. After subtraction of an underlying event using a model
that includes higher-order azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$, the
away-side yield of the highest trigger-\pt ($p_T^t>4$~GeV/$c$) correlations is
suppressed compared to that of correlations measured in $p$$+$$p$ collisions.
At the lowest associated particle $p_T$ ($0.5<p_T^a<1$ GeV/$c$), the away-side
shape and yield are modified relative to those in $p$$+$$p$ collisions. These
observations are consistent with the scenario of radiative-jet energy loss. For
the low-$p_T$ trigger correlations ($2<p_T^t<4$ GeV/$c$), a finite away-side
yield exists and we explore the dependence of the shape of the away-side within
the context of an underlying-event model. Correlations are also studied
differentially versus event-plane angle $\Psi_2$ and $\Psi_3$. The angular
correlations show an asymmetry when selecting the sign of the difference
between the trigger-particle azimuthal angle and the $\Psi_2$ event plane. This
asymmetry and the measured suppression of the pair yield out of plane is
consistent with a path-length-dependent energy loss. No $\Psi_3$ dependence can
be resolved within experimental uncertainties.

  Method",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiphase flows frequently occur in many important engineering and
scientific applications, but modeling of such flows is a rather challenging
task due to complex interfacial dynamics between different phases, let alone if
the flow is oscillating in the porous media. Using humid air as the working
fluid in the thermoacoustic refrigerator is one of the research focus to
improve the thermoacoustic performance, but the corresponding effect is the
condensation of humid air in the thermal stack. Due to the small sized spacing
of thermal stack and the need to explore the detailed condensation process in
oscillating flow, a mesoscale numerical approach need to be developed. Over the
decades, several types of Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models for multiphase flows
have been developed under different physical pictures, for example the
color-gradient model, the Shan-Chen model, the nonideal pressure tensor model
and the HSD model. In the current study, a pseudopotential
Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) LBM simulation was utilized to simulate the
incompressible oscillating flow and condensation in parallel plates. In the
initial stage of condensation, the oscillating flow benefits to accumulate the
saturated vapor at the exit regions, and the velocity vector of saturated vapor
clearly showed the flow over the droplets. It was also concluded that if the
condensate can be removed out from the parallel plates, the oscillating flow
and condensation will continuously feed the cold surface to form more water
droplets. The effect of wettability to the condensation was discussed, and it
turned out that by increasing the wettability, the saturated water vapor was
easier to condense on the cold walls, and the distance between each pair of
droplets was also strongly affected by the wettability.

handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available
video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed
resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few
videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As
such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which
contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging
conditions and are subject to authentic, often commingled distortions that are
impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on
real-world video data often perform poorly. Towards advancing NR video quality
prediction, we constructed a large-scale video quality assessment database
containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users,
with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a
large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of
4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding more than 205000
opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per
video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the LIVE
Video Quality Challenge Database (LIVE-VQC), by conducting a comparison of
leading NR video quality predictors on it. This study is the largest video
quality assessment study ever conducted along several key dimensions: number of
unique contents, capture devices, distortion types and combinations of
distortions, study participants, and recorded subjective scores. The database

edges. However, due to its rare appearance in natural compounds, experimental
realizations rely on a delicate artificial engineering involving materials with
helical states, magnetic fields and conventional superconductors. Here we
introduce an alternative path using a class of three-dimensional
antiferromagnet to engineer a two- dimensional topological superconductor. Our
proposal exploits the appearance of solitonic states at the interface between a
topologically trivial antiferromagnet and a conventional superconductor, which
realize a topological superconducting phase when their spectrum is gapped by
intrinsic spin- orbit coupling. We show that these interfacial states do not
require fine-tuning, but are protected by asymptotic boundary conditions.

fission neutron energy. In particular, the variation of fission product yields
with neutron energy has been considered as a possible source of the
discrepancies between antineutrino observations and models. In simulations of
low-enriched and highly-enriched reactor core designs, we find a substantial
fraction of fissions (from 5% to more than 40%) are caused by non-thermal
neutrons. Using tabulated evaluations of nuclear fission and decay, we estimate
the variation in antineutrino emission by the prominent fission parents U-235,
Pu-239, and Pu-241 versus neutron energy. The differences in fission neutron
energy are found to produce less than 1% variation in detected antineutrino
rate per fission of U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241. Corresponding variations in the
antineutrino spectrum are found to be less than 10% below 7 MeV antineutrino
energy, smaller than current model uncertainties. We conclude that insufficient
modeling of fission neutron energy is unlikely to be the cause of the various

utilizes such ferromagnetic semiconductors as channel materials, in addition to
ferromagnetic source/drain contacts. Such a device could retain the spin
polarization of injected electrons in the channel, the loss of which limits the
operation of traditional spin transistors with non-ferromagnetic channels. We
examine the operation of four material systems that are currently considered
some of the most prominent known ferromagnetic semiconductors, three
Heusler-type alloys (Mn2CoAl, CrVZrAl, CoVZrAl) and one from the oxide family
(NiFe2O4). We describe their bandstructures by using data from DFT
calculations. We investigate under which conditions high spin polarization and
significant ION/IOFF ratio, two essential requirements for the spin-MOSFET

balancing criteria in decision support systems, and researchers to examine the
properties of these criteria and the trade-offs made when optimizing them. As a
result, previous studies have provided a much-needed understanding of how
different equity functions affect the resulting VRP solutions. However, by
focusing exclusively on models which balance tour lengths, a critical aspect
has thus far remained unexplored -- namely the impact of the workload resource
subject to the balancing.
  In this work, we generalize previous studies to different workload resources,
extend the scope of those analyses to additional aspects of managerial and
methodological significance, and reevaluate accordingly previous conclusions
and guidelines for formulating a balance criterion. We propose a classification
of workload resources and equity functions, and establish which general types
of balanced VRP models can lead to unintended optimization outcomes. To explore
in greater detail the differences between models satisfying the given
guidelines, we conduct an extensive numerical study of 18 alternative balance
criteria. We base our observations not only on smaller instances solved to
optimality, but also on larger instances solved heuristically, to gauge the
extent to which our conclusions hold also for larger VRPs.
  Overall, our study counter-balances the focus of previous works and reveals
the importance of selecting the right workload resource.

detected with abundances much higher than those predicted from thermodynamic
equilibrium (TE) chemical models. The presence of the majority of these species
can be explained by shock-induced non-TE chemical models, where shocks caused
by the pulsating star take the chemistry out of TE in the inner region.
Moreover, a non-uniform density structure has been detected in several AGB
outflows. A detailed parameter study on the quantitative effects of a
non-homogeneous outflow has so far not been performed. We implement a porosity
formalism for treating the increased leakage of light associated with radiation
transport through a clumpy, porous medium. The effects from the altered UV
radiation field penetration on the chemistry, accounting also for the increased
reaction rates of two-body processes in the overdense clumps, are examined. We
present a parameter study of the effect of clumping and porosity on the
chemistry throughout the outflow. Both the higher density within the clumps and
the increased UV radiation field penetration have an important impact on the
chemistry, as they both alter the chemical pathways. The increased amount of UV
radiation in the inner region leads to photodissociation of parent species,
releasing the otherwise deficient elements. We find an increased abundance in
the inner region of all species not expected to be present assuming TE
chemistry, such as HCN in O-rich outflows, H$_2$O in C-rich outflows, and
NH$_3$ in both. Outflows whose clumps have a large overdensity and that are
very porous to the interstellar UV radiation field yield abundances comparable
to those observed in O- and C-rich outflows for most of the unexpected species
investigated. The inner wind abundances of H$_2$O in C-rich outflows and of
NH$_3$ in O- and C-rich outflows are however underpredicted.

learning is proposed herein as a novel concept to further reduce communication:
whenever poor communication performance is detected, an identification
experiment is triggered and an improved prediction model learned from data.
Effective learning triggers are obtained by comparing the actual communication
rate with the one that is expected based on the current model. By analyzing
statistical properties of the inter-communication times and leveraging powerful
convergence results, the proposed trigger is proven to limit learning
experiments to the necessary instants. Numerical and physical experiments
demonstrate that event-triggered learning improves robustness toward changing

especially at early times. (ii) Critical fluctuations near the quark-hadron
phase transition lead to a large bulk viscous pressure on the conversion
surface between hydrodynamics and a microscopic hadronic cascade description of

the optimization of the readout detuning can compensate the effect of the

interpreting the centrality dependence of many experimental observables. The CF
is constrained by centrality selection based on particle multiplicity in a
reference subevent, and contributes to observables measured in another
subevent. Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the
influence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities
$\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\epsilon_n)$, $p(\epsilon_n,\epsilon_m)$ and
$p(N,\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle
cumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation
is established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the
reference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle
production sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich
sign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the
underlying distributions. The details of sign-change pattern change with the
size of the collision systems. Simultaneous comparison of these different types
cumulants between model prediction and experimental data can be used to
constrain the CF and particle production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.
Since the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the
longitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use
pseudorapidity-separated subevent cumulant method to explore the nature of
intra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective dynamics. The subevent
method can be applied for any bulk observable that is sensitive to centrality,
and has the potential to separate different mechanisms for multiplicity and
flow fluctuations happening at different time scales. The forward detector
upgrades at RHIC and LHC will greatly enhance such studies in the future.

low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory

of a quantum computing system to scale cheaply through error correction and
fault-tolerance. While fault-tolerance requires relatively mild assumptions
about the nature of qubit errors, the overhead associated with coherent and
non-Markovian errors can be orders of magnitude larger than the overhead
associated with purely stochastic Markovian errors. One proposal to address
this challenge is to randomize the circuits of interest, shaping the errors to
be stochastic Pauli errors but leaving the aggregate computation unaffected.
The randomization technique can also suppress couplings to slow degrees of
freedom associated with non-Markovian evolution. Here we demonstrate the
implementation of Pauli-frame randomization in a superconducting circuit
system, exploiting a flexible programming and control infrastructure to achieve
this with low effort. We use high-accuracy gate-set tomography to characterize
in detail the properties of the circuit error, with and without the
randomization procedure, which allows us to make rigorous statements about
Markovianity as well as the nature of the observed errors. We demonstrate that
randomization suppresses signatures of non-Markovian evolution to statistically
insignificant levels, from a Markovian model violation ranging from $43\sigma$
to $1987\sigma$, down to violations between $0.3\sigma$ and $2.7\sigma$ under
randomization. Moreover, we demonstrate that, under randomization, the
experimental errors are well described by a Pauli error model, with model
violations that are similarly insignificant (between $0.8\sigma$ and
$2.7\sigma$). Importantly, all these improvements in the model accuracy were
obtained without degradation to fidelity, and with some improvements to error
rates as quantified by the diamond norm.

introduced which allow the radar to perform signal detection and parameter
estimation from much fewer measurements than that required by Nyquist sampling.
These systems - referred to as sub-Nyquist radars - model the received signal
as having finite rate of innovation and employ the Xampling framework to obtain
low-rate samples of the signal. Sub-Nyquist radars exploit the fact that the
target scene is sparse facilitating the use of compressed sensing (CS) methods
in signal recovery. In this chapter, we review several pulse-Doppler radar
systems based on these principles. Contrary to other CS-based designs, our
formulations directly address the reduced-rate analog sampling in space and
time, avoid a prohibitive dictionary size, and are robust to noise and clutter.
We begin by introducing temporal sub-Nyquist processing for estimating the
target locations using less bandwidth than conventional systems. This paves the
way to cognitive radars which share their transmit spectrum with other
communication services, thereby providing a robust solution for coexistence in
spectrally crowded environments. Next, without impairing Doppler resolution, we
reduce the dwell time by transmitting interleaved radar pulses in a scarce
manner within a coherent processing interval or ""slow time"". Then, we consider
multiple-input-multiple-output array radars and demonstrate spatial sub-Nyquist
processing which allows the use of few antenna elements without degradation in
angular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate application of sub-Nyquist and
cognitive radars to imaging systems such as synthetic aperture radar. For each
setting, we present a state-of-the-art hardware prototype designed to
demonstrate the real-time feasibility of sub-Nyquist radars.

instability in the presence of magnetic field for both optically thin and thick
regimes. When the flow is optically thin, magnetic field not only stabilizes
perturbations with short wavelengths, but also growth rate of the instability
at long wavelengths is reduced compared to a nonmagnetized case. Then, we
extend our analysis to the optically thick flows with a conserved total
specific entropy and properties of the unstable perturbations are investigated
in detail. Growth rate of the instability at short wavelengths is suppressed
due to the presence of the magnetic field, however, growth rate is nearly
constant at long wavelengths because of the radiation field. Since the
radiative bubbles around massive protostars are subject to the RT instability,
we also explore implications of our results in this context. In the
nonmagnetized case, the growth time-scale of the instability for a typical
bubble is found less than one thousand years which is very short compared to
the typical star formation time-scale. Magnetic field with a reasonable
strength significantly increases the growth time-scale to more than hundreds of
thousands years. The instability, furthermore, is more efficient at large
wavelengths, whereas in the non-magnetized case, growth rate at short
wavelengths is more significant.

points of $\mathbb R^3$ and compute, up to arbitrary precision, a maximum
subset with diameter at most $1$. More precisely, we give the first randomized
EPTAS and deterministic PTAS for Maximum Clique in unit ball graphs. Our
approximation algorithm also works on disk graphs with arbitrary radii. Almost
three decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found for Maximum
Clique on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson; Discrete Mathematics
'90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question whether or not
tractability can be extended to general disk graphs. Recently, it was shown
that the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk
graph [Bonnet, Giannopoulos, Kim, Rz\k{a}\.{z}ewski, Sikora; SoCG '18]. This
enabled the authors to derive a QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm for Max
Clique on disk graphs. In this paper, we improve the approximability to a
randomized EPTAS (and a deterministic PTAS). More precisely, we obtain a
randomized EPTAS for computing the independence number on graphs having no
disjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph, bounded VC-dimension,
and large independence number. We then address the question of computing Max
Clique for disks in higher dimensions. We show that intersection graphs of unit
balls, like disk graphs, do not admit the complement of two odd cycles as an
induced subgraph. This, in combination with the first result, straightforwardly
yields a randomized EPTAS for Max Clique on unit ball graphs. In stark
contrast, we show that on ball and unit 4-dimensional disk graphs, Max Clique
is NP-hard and does not admit an approximation scheme even in
subexponential-time, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.

micro-spectroscopy typically consists of thousands discrete pixel points, each

requires appropriate image unmixing computational methods to retrieve
non-negative spatial concentration and corresponding non-negative spectra of
the image biochemical constituents. In this article, we present a new efficient
Quantitative Hyperspectral Image Unmixing (Q-HIU) method for large-scale Raman
micro-spectroscopy data analysis. This method enables to simultaneously analyse
multi-set Raman hyperspectral images in three steps: (i) Singular Value
Decomposition with innovative Automatic Divisive Correlation (SVD-ADC) which
autonomously filters spatially and spectrally uncorrelated noise from data;
(ii) a robust subtraction of fluorescent background from the data using a newly
developed algorithm called Bottom Gaussian Fitting (BGF); (iii) an efficient
Quantitative Unsupervised/Partially Supervised Non-negative Matrix
Factorization method (Q-US/PS-NMF), which rigorously retrieves non-negative
spatial concentration maps and spectral profiles of the samples' biochemical
constituents with no a priori information and with great operation speed.
Alternatively, the Q-US/PS-NMF is capable to work as a partially supervised
method, when one or several samples' constituents are known, which
significantly widens chemical and biomedical applications of the method. We
apply the Q-HIU to the analysis of real large-scale Raman hyperspectral images
of human atherosclerotic aortic tissues and our results show a
proof-of-principle for the proposed method to retrieve the biochemical

is the opposite of common intuition. Frequent catastrophes are balanced by a
larger net-growth rate in surviving families, leading to the exponential growth

arises from HII regions around massive stars, and the amount of Lyman continuum
photons required to support the ionization indicate the presence of

where $\mu$ would be the lensing magnification factor. The observed line

photometry tracing rest-frame UV to millimeter continuum emission to further
constrain the properties of this dusty high redshift star-forming galaxy. Via

$\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and already has a stellar
mass of $8\times 10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$. We also
constrain the age of the current starburst to be $\leqslant$ 5 million years,
making G12v2.43 a gas rich galaxy lying above the star-forming main sequence at
z$\sim$3, undergoing a growth spurt and, could be on the main sequence within

applications. Due to the heterogeneity in HINs, the typed edges may not fully
align with each other. In order to capture the semantic subtlety, we propose
the concept of aspects with each aspect being a unit representing one
underlying semantic facet. Meanwhile, network embedding has emerged as a
powerful method for learning network representation, where the learned
embedding can be used as features in various downstream applications.
Therefore, we are motivated to propose a novel embedding learning
framework---AspEm---to preserve the semantic information in HINs based on
multiple aspects. Instead of preserving information of the network in one
semantic space, AspEm encapsulates information regarding each aspect
individually. In order to select aspects for embedding purpose, we further
devise a solution for AspEm based on dataset-wide statistics. To corroborate
the efficacy of AspEm, we conducted experiments on two real-words datasets with
two types of applications---classification and link prediction. Experiment
results demonstrate that AspEm can outperform baseline network embedding
learning methods by considering multiple aspects, where the aspects can be
selected from the given HIN in an unsupervised manner.

dependent on five observable quantities, accessible through measurements of the
galactic rotation curve, the gas and stellar surface densities, and the gas and

importance of each dynamical mechanism varies throughout the space of
observable galactic properties, and conclude that gravitational collapse and
galactic shear play the greatest role in setting the cloud lifetime for the
considered range of galaxy properties, while cloud-cloud collisions exert a
much lesser influence. All five environmental mechanisms are nevertheless
required to obtain a complete picture of cloud evolution. We apply our theory

preference for a component of high redshift ionization is driven by a sharp

provide the microscopic realization of the entropy of a class of BPS black
holes in $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity. Finally, inspired by our previous

one-dimensional scheme to calculate the gas density profile inside gaps by
balancing the gravitational and viscous torques. By generalizing the results of
Goodman & Rafikov (2001), our scheme properly accounts for the propagation of
angular momentum by density waves. This method allows us to easily study

Equivalently, this low-viscosity regime applies to every gap that is depleted

Ly$\alpha$ declines at $z$ > 6, suggesting an increasing fraction of neutral

asymptotically stable, then it admits a Lyapunov function which is the ratio of
two polynomials (i.e., a rational function). We further show that when the
vector field is polynomial, the Lyapunov inequalities on both the rational
function and its derivative have sum of squares certificates and hence such a
Lyapunov function can always be found by semidefinite programming. This
generalizes the classical fact that an asymptotically stable linear system
admits a quadratic Lyapunov function which satisfies a certain linear matrix
inequality. In addition to homogeneous vector fields, the result can be useful
for showing local asymptotic stability of non-homogeneous systems by proving
asymptotic stability of their lowest order homogeneous component.
  This paper also includes some negative results: We show that (i) in absence
of homogeneity, globally asymptotically stable polynomial vector fields may
fail to admit a global rational Lyapunov function, and (ii) in presence of
homogeneity, the degree of the numerator of a rational Lyapunov function may
need to be arbitrarily high (even for vector fields of fixed degree and
dimension). On the other hand, we also give a family of homogeneous polynomial
vector fields that admit a low-degree rational Lyapunov function but
necessitate polynomial Lyapunov functions of arbitrarily high degree. This
shows the potential benefits of working with rational Lyapunov functions,
particularly as the ones whose existence we guarantee have structured
denominators and are not more expensive to search for than polynomial ones.

Here we extend the Bayesian framework of Patel et al. (2017b) to include all MW
satellites with measured 6D phase space information and apply it with the
Illustris-Dark simulation to constrain the MW's mass. Using the properties of
each MW satellite individually, we find that the scatter among mass estimates
is reduced when the magnitude of specific orbital angular momentum (j) is
adopted rather than their combined instantaneous positions and velocities. We
also find that high j satellites (i.e. Leo II) constrain the upper limits for
the MW's mass and low j satellites rather than the highest speed satellites
(i.e. Leo I and LMC), set the lower mass limits. When j of all classical
satellites is used to simultaneously estimate the MW's mass, we conclude the
halo mass is $0.85^{+0.23}_{-0.26}\times 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ (including
Sagittarius dSph) and $0.96^{+0.29}_{-0.28} \times 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$
(excluding Sagittarius dSph), cautioning that low j satellites on decaying
orbits like Sagittarius dSph may bias the distribution. These estimates
markedly reduce the current factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW.
We also find a well-defined relationship between host halo mass and satellite j
distribution, which yields the prediction that upcoming PMs for ultra-faint
dwarfs should reveal j within $ 5\times10^3 - 10^4$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. This is a
promising method to significantly constrain the cosmologically expected mass
range for the MW and eventually M31 as more satellite PMs become available.

gluinos that undergo an all-hadronic decay with no missing energy, as can arise
in R-parity violating or stealth supersymmetry. Although the gluino->jj decay
is robustly excluded, there is gap in current experimental coverage for gluinos
with masses between 51-76 GeV that decay into three light-flavor quarks. In
this work, we probe this gap with published multi-jet data from the UA2
experiment. Despite setting the strongest current limit on this region, we find
that UA2 data is unable to close this gap for gluino->jjj decays. In addition
to this three-jet gap, we note an additional gap for all-hadronic gluino -> n
parton decays with $n\geq 4$ for light gluinos (51 GeV < m < 300 GeV) not

graphs. Given a graph in such a family, we want to assign some string of bits
to each vertex in such a way that we can recover the information about whether
2 vertices are connected or not using only the 2 strings of bits associated
with those two vertices. We then want to minimise the length of this string.
The conjecture states that if the family is hereditary and small enough (it
only has $2^{O(n\ln(n))}$ graphs of size $n$), then $O(\ln(n))$ bits per vertex
should be sufficient. The trivial bounds on this problem are that: (1) some
families require at least $\ln_2(n)$ bits per vertex ; (2) $(n-1)/2+\ln_2(n)$
bits per vertex are sufficient for all families.
  In this paper, we will be talking about a special case of the implicit
representation conjecture, where the family is semi-algebraic (which roughly
means that the vertices are points in some euclidean space, and the edges are
defined geometrically, or according to some polynomials). We will first prove
that the `obvious' way of storing the information, where we store an
approximation of the coordinates of each vertex, doesn't work. Then we will
come up with a way of storing the information that requires $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$
bits per vertex, where $\epsilon$ is some small constant depending only on the
family. This is a slight improvement over the trivial bound, but is still a
long way from proving the conjecture.

limited color gamut. Double-layer graphene (DLG) membranes grown by chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) can also recreate the interference effect like in IMODs
as proven with drumheads displaying Newton's rings. Here, we report on the
electro-optical response of CVD DLG mechanical pixels by measuring the change
in wavelength-dependent reflectance of a suspended graphene drumhead as a

proposed energy allocation strategy is computationally light and only relies on
the second-order statistics of the system parameters. For this, we first
consider an offline non-convex optimization problem, which is solved exactly

online power allocation policy that requires minimal online computation and
satisfies the dynamics of energy flow at each sensor. We prove that the
proposed online policy is asymptotically equivalent to the optimal offline

the estimation performance of the proposed online scheme is better than that of
the online scheme when channel state information about the dynamical system is

fair ranking. Existing methods in fairness-aware ranking are mainly based on
statistical parity that cannot measure the true discriminatory effect since
discrimination is causal. On the other hand, existing methods in causal-based
anti-discrimination learning focus on classification problems and cannot be
directly applied to handle the ranked data. To address these limitations, we
propose to map the rank position to a continuous score variable that represents
the qualification of the candidates. Then, we build a causal graph that
consists of both the discrete profile attributes and the continuous score. The
path-specific effect technique is extended to the mixed-variable causal graph
to identify both direct and indirect discrimination. The relationship between
the path-specific effects for the ranked data and those for the binary decision
is theoretically analyzed. Finally, algorithms for discovering and removing
discrimination from a ranked dataset are developed. Experiments using the real
dataset show the effectiveness of our approaches.

study generic nonequilibrium processes. Here we use LR to derive TURs in a
straightforward and unified way. Our approach allows us to generalize TURs to
systems without local time reversal symmetry, including, for example, ballistic
transport, and periodically driven classical and quantum systems. We find that
for broken time reversal, the bounds on the relative uncertainty are controlled

also extend our approach beyond linear response: for Markovian dynamics it

optimizing loss functions with strictly monotone tails, such as the logistic

conditions on the tail of the loss function under which gradient descent
converges in the direction of the $L_2$ maximum-margin separator? (b) how does
the rate of margin convergence depend on the tail of the loss function and the
choice of the step size? We show that for a large family of super-polynomial
tailed losses, gradient descent iterates on linear networks of any depth
converge in the direction of $L_2$ maximum-margin solution, while this does not
hold for losses with heavier tails. Within this family, for simple linear
models we show that the optimal rates with fixed step size is indeed obtained
for the commonly used exponentially tailed losses such as logistic loss.
However, with a fixed step size the optimal convergence rate is extremely slow
as $1/\log(t)$, as also proved in Soudry et al. (2018). For linear models with
exponential loss, we further prove that the convergence rate could be improved
to $\log (t) /\sqrt{t}$ by using aggressive step sizes that compensates for the
rapidly vanishing gradients. Numerical results suggest this method might be
useful for deep networks.

that VGGNet receives the best overall accuracy at 92.53\% in classifications.
For localizing abnormalities, ResNet is selected for computing class activation

topic in stellar astrophysics. Several models have been proposed to understand
the formation of bound and unbound clusters and their evolution, and these can
be tested by examining the kinematical and dynamical properties of clusters
over a wide range of ages and masses. Aims. We use the Gaia-ESO Survey products
to study four open clusters (IC 2602, IC 2391, IC 4665, and NGC 2547) that lie
in the age range between 20 and 50 Myr. Methods. We employ the gravity index
$\gamma$ and the equivalent width of the lithium line at 6708 $\AA$, together
with effective temperature $\rm{T_{eff}}$, and the metallicity of the stars in
order to discard observed contaminant stars. Then, we derive the cluster radial
velocity dispersions $\sigma_c$, the total cluster mass $\rm{M}_{tot}$, and the
half mass radius $r_{hm}$. Using the $Gaia$-DR1 TGAS catalogue, we
independently derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clusters from the
astrometric parameters of cluster members. Results. The intrinsic radial
velocity dispersions derived by the spectroscopic data are larger than those
derived from the TGAS data, possibly due to the different masses of the
considered stars. Using $\rm{M}_{tot}$ and $r_{hm}$ we derive the virial
velocity dispersion $\sigma_{vir}$ and we find that three out of four clusters
are supervirial. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that these
clusters are dispersing, as predicted by the ""residual gas expulsion"" scenario.
However, recent simulations show that the virial ratio of young star clusters
may be overestimated if it is determined using the global velocity dispersion,
since the clusters are not fully relaxed.

strain in elastoresistivity measurements. A sample experiencing AC strain has a
time-dependent resistivity, which modulates the voltage produced by an AC

are directly proportional to the elastoresistivity, and which can be measured
more quickly, with less strain on the sample, and with less stringent
requirements for temperature stability than the previous DC technique. Example
measurements between 10 Hz and 3 kHz are performed on a material with a large,
well-characterized and temperature dependent elastoresistivity: the
representative iron-based superconductor BaFe$_{1.975}$Co$_{0.025}$As$_2$.
These measurements yield a frequency independent elastoresistivity and
reproduce results from previous DC elastoresistivity methods to within
experimental accuracy. We emphasize that the dynamic (AC) elastoresistivity is
a distinct material-specific property that has not previously been considered.

model introduced in Hou et al. (2017), along with two earlier GALFORM cooling
models and the L-GALAXIES and MORGANA cooling models. We find that the
predictions of the new GALFORM cooling model are generally in best agreement
with the simulations. For halos with $M_{\rm halo}\lesssim 3\times
10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, the SA models predict that the timescale for
radiative cooling is shorter than or comparable to the gravitational infall
timescale. Even though SA models assume that gas falls onto galaxies from a
spherical gas halo, while the simulations show that the cold gas is accreted
through filaments, both methods predict similar mass cooling rates, because in
both cases the gas accretion occurs on similar timescales. For halos with
$M_{\rm halo}\gtrsim 10^{12}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, gas in the simulations
typically cools from a roughly spherical hot gas halo, as assumed in the SA
models, but the halo gas gradually contracts during cooling, leading to
compressional heating. SA models ignore this heating, and so overestimate mass
cooling rates by factors of a few. At low redshifts halo major mergers or a
sequence of successive smaller mergers are seen in the simulations to strongly
heat the halo gas and suppress cooling, while mergers at high redshifts do not
suppress cooling, because the gas filaments are difficult to heat up. The new
SA cooling model best captures these effects.

depletion from the gas phase, that increases with gas density. Our recent model
of dust evolution, based on hydrodynamic simulations of the lifecycle of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) proves that the observed trend for [Si$_{gas}$/H] is
driven by a combination of dust growth by accretion in the cold diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) and efficient destruction by supernova (SN) shocks
(Zhukovska et al. 2016). With an analytic model of dust evolution, we
demonstrate that even with optimistic assumptions for the dust input from stars
and without destruction of grains by SNe it is impossible to match the observed
[Si$_{gas}$/H]$-n_H$ relation without growth in the ISM. We extend the
framework developed in our previous work for silicates to include the evolution
of iron grains and address a long-standing conundrum: ``Where is the
interstellar iron?'. Much higher depletion of Fe in the warm neutral medium
compared to Si is reproduced by the models, in which a large fraction of
interstellar iron (70%) is locked as inclusions in silicate grains, where it is
protected from sputtering by SN shocks. The slope of the observed
[Fe$_{gas}$/H]$-n_H$ relation is reproduced if the remaining depleted iron
resides in a population of metallic iron nanoparticles with sizes in the range
of 1-10nm. Enhanced collision rates due to the Coulomb focusing are important
for both silicate and iron dust models to match the observed slopes of the
relations between depletion and density and the magnitudes of depletion at high
density.

propose a hybrid metaheuristic which combines an iterated local search with
variable neighborhood descent, for solution improvement, and a set partitioning
formulation, to exploit the memory of the past search. Moreover, we investigate
a class of combined neighborhoods which jointly modify the sequences of visits
and perform either heuristic or optimal reassignments of vehicles to routes. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified approach for a large class
of heterogeneous fleet RVRPs, capable of solving more than 12 problem variants.
The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated on 643 well-known benchmark
instances, and 71.70\% of the best known solutions are either retrieved or
improved. Moreover, the proposed metaheuristic, which can be considered as a
matheuristic, produces high quality solutions with low standard deviation in
comparison with previous methods. Finally, we observe that the use of combined
neighborhoods does not lead to significant quality gains. Contrary to
intuition, the computational effort seems better spent on more intensive route
optimization rather than on more intelligent and frequent fleet re-assignments.

magnetic field rotation consistent with magnetic reconnection (operating above

by high-fluxes of trapped high-energy electrons and protons, which resemble the
Cluster observations of cusp diamagnetic cavities at the northern hemisphere

(Insespital), which is used as a controlled 18 MeV proton source. The
adjustable beam current allows for dose rate dependent characterisation over a
large dynamic range, from 0.1 to 1000 Grad per hour. The beam can be tuned so
that the user can obtain the desired irradiation conditions. A complete study
of the device under irradiation is possible thanks to dedicated beam monitoring
systems as well as a power control system for the device under irradiation,
which can be operated on-line. Further characterisations of the irradiated
devices are possible thanks to a laboratory equipped with gamma spectroscopy
detectors, ammeters and transient current technique setups.

sensing to plan local grasp adjustments. Our approach determines regrasp
actions by virtually searching for local transformations of tactile
measurements that improve the quality of the grasp. First, we construct a
tactile-based grasp quality metric using a deep convolutional neural network
trained on over 2800 grasps. The quality of each grasp, a continuous value
between 0 and 1, is determined experimentally by measuring its resistance to
external perturbations. Second, we simulate the tactile imprints associated
with robot motions relative to the initial grasp by performing rigid-body
transformations of the given tactile measurements. The newly generated tactile
imprints are evaluated with the learned grasp quality network and the regrasp
action is chosen to maximize the grasp quality.
  Results show that the grasp quality network can predict the outcome of grasps
with an average accuracy of 85% on known objects and 75% on a cross validation
set of 12 objects. The regrasp control policy improves the success rate of
grasp actions by an average relative increase of 70% on a test set of 8

unsupervised learning. Assuming the information content of this model to be
mainly reflected by the spectral properties of its weight matrix $W$, we try to
make a realistic analysis by averaging over an appropriate statistical ensemble
of RBMs.
  First, a phase diagram is derived. Otherwise similar to that of the
Sherrington- Kirkpatrick (SK) model with ferromagnetic couplings, the RBM's
phase diagram presents a ferromagnetic phase which may or may not be of
compositional type depending on the kurtosis of the distribution of the
components of the singular vectors of $W$.
  Subsequently, the learning dynamics of the RBM is studied in the
thermodynamic limit. A ""typical"" learning trajectory is shown to solve an
effective dynamical equation, based on the aforementioned ensemble average and
explicitly involving order parameters obtained from the thermodynamic analysis.
In particular, this let us show how the evolution of the dominant singular
values of $W$, and thus of the unstable modes, is driven by the input data. At
the beginning of the training, in which the RBM is found to operate in the
linear regime, the unstable modes reflect the dominant covariance modes of the
data. In the non-linear regime, instead, the selected modes interact and
eventually impose a matching of the order parameters to their empirical
counterparts estimated from the data.
  Finally, we illustrate our considerations by performing experiments on both
artificial and real data, showing in particular how the RBM operates in the

the 32 target sources. We find that at high resolution, when considering
matched maser components, a 3:1 flux density ratio is observed between the 95-

resolution studies. The 95-GHz maser components appear to be preferentially
located closer to the driving sources and this may indicate that this

do not observe an elevated association rate between 95-GHz maser emission and
more evolved sources, as indicated by the presence of 12.2-GHz class~II masers.

the Caputo fractional derivative operator in time discretization and Fourier
spectral method in spatial discretization. Refinement tests are conducted to
verify the $2-\alpha$ order of time convergence, with $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ the
fractional order of derivative. Several numerical simulations are presented to
demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our newly proposed scheme. By
exploring the fast algorithm calculating the Caputo fractional derivative, our
numerical scheme makes it practice for long time simulation of MBE coarsening,
which is essential for MBE model in practice. With the proposed fractional MBE
model, we observe that the scaling law for the energy decays as $
O(t^{-\frac{\alpha}{3}})$ and the roughness increases as
$O(t^{\frac{\alpha}{3}})$, during the coarsening dynamics with random initial
condition. That is to say, the coarsening rate of MBE model could be
manipulated by the fractional order $\alpha$, and it is linearly proportional
to $\alpha$. This is the first time in literature to report/discover such
scaling correlation. It provides a potential application field for fractional
differential equations. Besides, the numerical approximation strategy proposed
in this paper can be readily applied to study many classes of time-fractional

habitable zones of low mass stars ($\sim0.1-0.6\,M_\odot$). Furthermore, it has
been argued that a large moon may be important for stabilizing conditions on a
planet for life. If these two features are combined, then an exoplanet can feel
a similar tidal influence from both its moon and parent star, leading to
potentially interesting dynamics. The moon's orbital evolution depends on the
exoplanet's initial spin period $P_0$. When $P_0$ is small, transfer of the
exoplanet's angular momentum to the moon's orbit can cause the moon to migrate
outward sufficiently to be stripped by the star. When $P_0$ is large, the moon
migrates less and the star's tidal torques spin down the exoplanet. Tidal
interactions then cause the moon to migrate inward until it is likely tidally
disrupted by the exoplanet and potentially produces rings. While one may think
that these findings preclude the presence of moons for the exoplanets of low
mass stars, in fact a wide range of timescales are found for the loss or
destruction of the moon; it can take $\sim10^6-10^{10}\,{\rm yrs}$ depending on
the system parameters. When the moon is still present, the combined tidal
torques force the exoplanet to spin asynchronously with respect to both its
moon and parent star, which tidally heats the exoplanet. This can produce heat
fluxes comparable to those currently coming through the Earth, arguing that
combined tides may be a method for driving tectonic activity in exoplanets.

  Methods and Results: We simulated 2D-bumpy atrial model by varying the degree
of bumpiness, and 3D-left atrial (LA) models integrated by LA computed
tomographic (CT) images taken from 14 patients with persistent AF. We also
analyzed wave-dynamic parameters with bipolar electrograms during AF and
compared them with LA-CT geometry in 30 patients with persistent AF. In
2D-bumpy model, APD dispersion increased (p<0.001) and wavebreak occurred
spontaneously when the surface bumpiness was higher, showing phase
transition-like behavior (p<0.001). Bumpiness gradient 2D-model showed that
spiral wave drifted in the direction of higher bumpiness, and phase singularity
(PS) points were mostly located in areas with higher bumpiness. In 3D-LA model,
PS density was higher in LA appendage (LAA) compared to other LA parts
(p<0.05). In 30 persistent AF patients, the surface bumpiness of LAA was
5.8-times that of other LA parts (p<0.001), and exceeded critical bumpiness to
induce wavebreak. Wave dynamics complexity parameters were consistently
dominant in LAA (p<0.001).
  Conclusion: The bumpy tissue geometry promotes APD dispersion, wavebreak, and
spiral wave drift in in silico human atrial tissue, and corresponds to clinical
electro-anatomical maps.

an invaluable model system for the study of Mott physics. Here we report the
realization of such a tunable Mott insulator in the ABC trilayer graphene (TLG)
and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure with a moir\'e superlattice.
Unlike massless Dirac electrons in monolayer graphene, electrons in pristine
ABC TLG are characterized by quartic energy dispersion and large effective mass
that are conducive for strongly correlated phenomena. The moir\'e superlattice
in TLG/hBN heterostructures leads to narrow electronic minibands that are gate
tunable. Each filled miniband contains 4 electrons in one moir\'e lattice site
due to the spin and valley degeneracy of graphene. The Mott insulator states
emerge at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings, corresponding to one electron and two electrons
per site, respectively. Moreover, the Mott states in the ABC TLG/hBN
heterostructure exhibit unprecedented tunability: the Mott gap can be modulated
in situ by a vertical electrical field, and at the meantime, the electron
doping can be gate-tuned to fill the band from one Mott insulating state to
another. Our observation of a tunable Mott insulator opens up exciting
opportunities to explore novel strongly correlated phenomena in two-dimensional

evidence for multiple different Comptonisation regions contributing to the hard
X-rays in addition to a cool disc component. We show this explicitly for some
of the best RXTE data from Cyg X-1, where the spectrum strongly requires (at
least) two different Comptonisation components in order to fit the continuum
above 3 keV, where the disc does not contribute. However, it is difficult to
constrain the shapes of these Comptonisation components uniquely using spectral
data alone. Instead, we show that additional information from fast variability
can break this degeneracy. Specifically, we use the observed variability power
spectra in each energy channel to reconstruct the energy spectra of the
variability on timescales of ~10s, 1s and 0.1s. The two longer timescale
spectra have similar shapes, but the fastest component is dramatically harder,
and has strong curvature indicating that its seed photons are not from the cool
disc. We interpret this in the context of propagating fluctuations through a
hot flow, where the outer regions are cooler and optically thick, so that they
shield the inner region from the disc. The seed photons for the hot inner
region are then from the cooler Comptonisation region rather than the disc
itself.

over most of disk. We study the effect of the dark matter halo on small-scale

small-scale spiral structure in the outer gas disk, but the addition of dark
matter halo in the analysis results in a higher Toomre Q parameter which
prevents the amplification almost completely. This trend is also seen to be
true in regions inside the optical radius. This implies absence of strong
small-scale spiral arms in these galaxies, which is in agreement with

  Indirect inference (II) is a classical likelihood-free approach that
pre-dates the main developments of ABC and relies on simulation from a
parametric model of interest to determine point estimates of the parameters. It
is not surprising then that some likelihood-free Bayesian approaches have
harnessed the II literature. This chapter provides an introduction to II and
details the connections between ABC and II. A particular focus is placed on the

light-matter interaction when the phonon mode interfaces both parts. By
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and computing the density matrix in a master

photons in optical cavities and excitons in a quantum dot. For large energy
detuning between the cavity and the mechanical resonator it is obtained a
phonon-dispersive effective Hamiltonian which is able to retrieve much of the
physics of the conventional Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In order to
characterize this mediated coupling, we make a quantitative comparison between
both models and analyze light-matter entanglement and purity of the system

remains a mystery. Their orbits are nearly circular and are near mean-motion
resonances and nearly coplanar with Charon's orbit. One scenario suggests that
they all formed close to their current locations from a disk of debris that was
ejected from the Charon-forming impact before the tidal evolution of Charon.
The validity of this scenario is tested by performing $N$-body simulations with
the small satellites treated as test particles and Pluto-Charon evolving
tidally from an initial orbit at a few Pluto radii with initial eccentricity
$e_{\rm C} = 0$ or 0.2. After tidal evolution, the free eccentricities $e_{\rm
free}$ of the test particles are extracted by applying fast Fourier
transformation to the distance between the test particles and the center of
mass of the system and compared with the current eccentricities of the four
small satellites. The only surviving test particles with $e_{\rm free}$
matching the eccentricities of the current satellites are those not affected by
mean-motion resonances during the tidal evolution in a model with Pluto's
effective tidal dissipation function $Q = 100$ and an initial $e_{\rm C}$ = 0.2

preference to be in or near 4:1, 5:1 and 6:1 resonances with Charon. An
alternative scenario may be needed to explain the formation of Pluto's small

$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$-P, the four well known atomically thin

anisotropic band dispersion, the charge carrier mobility of the pristine
allotropes is significantly higher (more than 5 times in some cases) in one of
the principal directions (zigzag or armchair) as compared to the other.
Uniaxial strain (upto 6% compressive/tensile) leads to bandgap alteration in
each of the allotropes, especially a direct to indirect bandgap semiconductor
transition in $\gamma$-P and a complete closure of the bandgap in $\gamma$ and
$\delta$-P. We find that the charge carrier mobility is enhanced typically by a
factor of $\approx 5-10$ in all the allotropes due to uniaxial strain; notably
among them a $\approx 250$ (30) times increase of the hole (electron) mobility
along the armchair (zigzag) direction is observed in $\beta$-P ($\gamma$-P)
under a compressive strain, acting in the armchair direction. Interestingly,
the preferred electronic conduction direction can also be changed in case of
$\alpha$ and $\gamma$-P, by applying strain.

the returns of the stocks are positively (negatively) correlated when agents'
expected returns for one stock are positively (negatively) correlated with the
historical return of the other. We provide both numerical simulations and
analytical studies and give explanations to stock correlations for cases with
agents having either homogeneous or heterogeneous expected returns. The result
still holds when other factors such as holding decisions and external events
are included which broadens the practicability of the model.

crucial to effective neural net training. There has been much recent interest
in gradient-based meta-optimization, where one tunes hyperparameters, or even
learns an optimizer, in order to minimize the expected loss when the training
procedure is unrolled. But because the training procedure must be unrolled
thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an
orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net
training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias
towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a
toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon
bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time
horizons. We then run meta-optimization experiments (both offline and online)
on standard benchmark datasets, showing that meta-optimization chooses too
small a learning rate by multiple orders of magnitude, even when run with a
moderately long time horizon (100 steps) typical of work in the area. We
believe short-horizon bias is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed
if meta-optimization is to scale to practical neural net training regimes.

  Wireless-Powered IoT Systems","Accepted to appear in IEEE Internet of Things Journal",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops and evaluates an accumulate-then-transmit framework for
multi-user scheduling in a full-duplex (FD) wireless-powered Internet-of-Things
system, consisting of multiple energy harvesting (EH) IoT devices (IoDs) and
one FD hybrid access point (HAP). All IoDs have no embedded energy supply and
thus need to perform EH before transmitting their data to the HAP. Thanks to
its FD capability, the HAP can simultaneously receive data uplink and broadcast
energy-bearing signals downlink to charge IoDs. The instantaneous channel
information is assumed unavailable throughout this paper. To maximize the
system average throughput, we design a new throughput-oriented scheduling
scheme, in which a single IoD with the maximum weighted residual energy is
selected to transmit information to the HAP, while the other IoDs harvest and
accumulate energy from the signals broadcast by the HAP. However, similar to
most of the existing throughput-oriented schemes, the proposed
throughout-oriented scheme also leads to unfair inter-user throughput because
IoDs with better channel performance will be granted more transmission
opportunities. To strike a balance between the system throughput and user
fairness, we then propose a fairness-oriented scheduling scheme based on the
normalized accumulated energy. To evaluate the system performance, we model the
dynamic charging/discharging processes of each IoD as a finite-state Markov
Chain. Analytical expressions of the system outage probability and average
throughput are derived over Rician fading channels for both proposed schemes.
Simulation results validate the performance analysis and demonstrate the
performance superiority of both proposed schemes over the existing schemes.

of their outcomes. Even though randomization generates comparable treatment and
control groups, the remaining survivors often differ significantly in
background variables that are prognostic to the outcomes. This is called the
truncation by death problem. Under the potential outcomes framework, the only
well-defined causal effect on the outcome is within the subgroup of patients
who would always survive under both treatment and control. Because the
definition of the subgroup depends on the potential values of the survival
status that could not be observed jointly, without making strong parametric
assumptions, we cannot identify the causal effect of interest and consequently
can only obtain bounds of it. Unfortunately, however, many bounds are too wide
to be useful. We propose to use detailed survival information before and after
the measurements of the outcomes to sharpen the bounds of the subgroup causal
effect. Because survival times contain useful information about the final
outcome, carefully utilizing them could improve statistical inference without
imposing strong parametric assumptions. Moreover, we propose to use a copula
model to relax the commonly-invoked but often doubtful monotonicity assumption
that the treatment extends the survival time for all patients.

proposed for computing a two-predictor PID over discrete spaces.
[arXiv:1709.06653] A lattice of maximum entropy probability models is
constructed based on marginal dependency constraints, and the unique
information that a particular predictor has about the target is defined as the
minimum increase in joint predictor-target mutual information when that
particular predictor-target marginal dependency is constrained. Here, we apply
the Idep approach to Gaussian systems, for which the marginally constrained
maximum entropy models are Gaussian graphical models. Closed form solutions for
the Idep PID are derived for both univariate and multivariate Gaussian systems.
Numerical and graphical illustrations are provided, together with practical and
theoretical comparisons of the Idep PID with the minimum mutual information PID
(Immi). [arXiv:1411.2832] In particular, it is proved that the Immi method
generally produces larger estimates of redundancy and synergy than does the
Idep method. In discussion of the practical examples, the PIDs are complemented
by the use of deviance tests for the comparison of Gaussian graphical models.

Machines (RBM), namely, the Online Generative Discriminative Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (OGD-RBM), that provides the ability to build and adapt the
network architecture of RBM according to the statistics of streaming data. The
OGD-RBM is trained in two phases: (1) an online generative phase for
unsupervised feature representation at the hidden layer and (2) a
discriminative phase for classification. The online generative training begins
with zero neurons in the hidden layer, adds and updates the neurons to adapt to
statistics of streaming data in a single pass unsupervised manner, resulting in
a feature representation best suited to the data. The discriminative phase is
based on stochastic gradient descent and associates the represented features to
the class labels. We demonstrate the OGD-RBM on a set of multi-category and
binary classification problems for data sets having varying degrees of
class-imbalance. We first apply the OGD-RBM algorithm on the multi-class MNIST
dataset to characterize the network evolution. We demonstrate that the online
generative phase converges to a stable, concise network architecture, wherein
individual neurons are inherently discriminative to the class labels despite
unsupervised training. We then benchmark OGD-RBM performance to other machine
learning, neural network and ClassRBM techniques for credit scoring
applications using 3 public non-stationary two-class credit datasets with
varying degrees of class-imbalance. We report that OGD-RBM improves accuracy by
2.5-3% over batch learning techniques while requiring at least 24%-70% fewer
neurons and fewer training samples. This online generative training approach
can be extended greedily to multiple layers for training Deep Belief Networks
in non-stationary data mining applications without the need for a priori fixed
architectures.

descriptions of the Universe. One aspect of this problem is the conspicuous
absence of time in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, which is the analogue of the
Schrodinger equation for the Universal wavefunction. Page and Wootters famously
addressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing
time evolution into this timeless cosmological picture. Their method, which is
sometimes called the conditional probability interpretation (CPI), requires the
identification of an internal clock system that is meant to keep time for the
remainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the
idealized limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock.
However, by allowing for interactions, we have found the counter-intuitive
result that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the optimal choice, even
if it is `ideal'. In particular, the uncertainty that is associated with the
physical measurement of an atomic clock is found to decrease monotonically as
the interactions grow stronger. This observation, which is reinforced by a
previous study using a semi-classical clock, paves the way to an independent
argument that is based on the energy conservation of any isolated system. Our
conclusion is that ideal clocks must be prohibited from the CPI when recovering
cosmological time evolution. Interactions are necessary for describing time
evolution as a strict matter of principle. Lastly, we also consider the
implications of this result for the experience of time in the evolution of the
Universe.

revealed exotic phases of matter governed by topological properties of
low-dimensional materials such as thin films of superfluids and
superconductors. Key to this phenomenon is the appearance and interaction of
vortices and antivortices in an angular degree of freedom---typified by the
classical XY model---due to thermal fluctuations. In the 2D Ising model this
angular degree of freedom is absent in the classical case, but with the
addition of a transverse field it can emerge from the interplay between
frustration and quantum fluctuations. Consequently a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)
phase transition has been predicted in the quantum system by theory and
simulation. Here we demonstrate a large-scale quantum simulation of this
phenomenon in a network of 1,800 in situ programmable superconducting flux
qubits arranged in a fully-frustrated square-octagonal lattice. Essential to
the critical behavior, we observe the emergence of a complex order parameter
with continuous rotational symmetry, and the onset of quasi-long-range order as
the system approaches a critical temperature. We use a simple but previously
undemonstrated approach to statistical estimation with an annealing-based
quantum processor, performing Monte Carlo sampling in a chain of reverse
quantum annealing protocols. Observations are consistent with classical
simulations across a range of Hamiltonian parameters. We anticipate that our
approach of using a quantum processor as a programmable magnetic lattice will
find widespread use in the simulation and development of exotic materials.

and in the second, a microwave plane wave is applied to the upper levels
transition for non-degenerated scheme. It is shown that the atom-photon
entanglement in both schemes depends on the intensity profile as well as the
orbital angular momentum (OAM) of applied fields so that the various spatially
dependent entanglement patterns can be generated by Laguerre-Gaussian beams
with different OAMs. However, no entanglement appears in the center of optical
vortex beams, because of the zero intensity. As a result, the entanglement
between atoms and its spontaneous emissions in different points of the atomic
cell can be controlled by the OAM of the applied fields. Moreover, our
numerical results show that the number of the local maximum degree of
entanglement peaks are determined by the OAM of the applied fields. It seems
that the present results would greatly facilitate the determination of the OAM

Temporal Logic (LTL), under the situation where processes are synchronous,

input formula, which can be used to optimize the decentralized monitoring of
LTL in various ways. Given a system P and an LTL formula L, we construct a

efficient round-robin communication policy for processes, and (b) to allow
processes to propagate their observations in an optimal way. In our framework,
processes can propagate truth values of atomic formulas, compound formulas, and
temporal formulas depending on the syntactic structure of the input LTL formula

mechanisms for the generation of directed and elliptic flows in Au+Au
collisions focusing on the role of hadronic rescattering and spectator
shadowing within a microscopic transport model JAM with different equation of
state. A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical
origin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type
nucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity
due to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is
turned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy
region of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV. In contrast, above 30 GeV there is no
spectator shadowing at midrapidity, and initial nucleon-nucleon collisions do
not generate directed flow, but subsequent rescatterings among produced
particles generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons. It is demonstrated that
negative pion-directed flows are mostly generated by the interaction with the
spectator matter. It is also shown that the squeeze-out effect is largely
suppressed in the case of softening, which leads to the enhancement of elliptic
flow around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5-7$ GeV. The elliptic flow at midrapidity above 10
GeV is not influenced by the squeeze-out due to spectator matter, while its
effect is seen at the forward rapidity range of $y/y_\mathrm{c.m.}>0.5$, which
decreases as beam energy increases.

when embedded boundary strategies are employed. Owing to the loss of
regularity, in this paper we propose a new spectral collocation method which
retains the regularity of solutions to solve differential equations in the case
of complex geometries. The idea is rooted in the basis functions defined in an
extended domain, which leads to a useful upper bound of the Lebesgue constant
with respect to the Fourier best approximation. In particular, how the
stretching of the domain defining basis functions affects the convergence rate
directly is detailed. Error estimates chosen in our proposed method show that
the exponential decay convergence for problems with analytical solutions can be
retained. Moreover, two-dimensional Poisson equations and convection-diffusion
equations with simple and complex geometrical domains will be simulated. The
predicted results justify the advantages of applying our method to tackle
geometrically complicated problems.

disclose analogies and departures of the quantum motion induced in a

pilot-aware attack, by jamming, nulling and spoofing pilot tones, can
significantly paralyze the uplink channel training in large-scale MISO-OFDM

coding based (ICCB) uplink training architecture for one-ring scattering
scenarios allowing for uniform linear arrays (ULA) deployment. Here, we not
only insert randomized pilots on subcarriers for channel impulse response (CIR)
estimation, but also diversify and encode subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs)
to convey those pilots simultaneously. The coded SAPs, though interfered by
arbitrary unknown SAPs in wireless environment, are qualified to be reliably
identified and decoded into the original pilots by checking the hidden channel
independence existing in subcarri- ers. Specifically, an independence-checking
coding (ICC) theory is formulated to support the encoding/decoding process in
this architecture. The optimal ICC code is further developed for guaranteeing a
well-imposed estimation of CIR while maximizing the code rate. Based on this
code, the identification error probability (IEP) is characterized to evaluate
the reliability of this architecture. Interestingly, we discover the principle
of IEP reduction by exploiting the array spatial correlation, and prove that
zero-IEP, i.e., perfect reliability, can be guaranteed under
continuously-distributed mean angle of arrival (AoA). Besides this, a novel
closed form of IEP expression is derived in discretely- distributed case.
Simulation results finally verify the effectiveness of the proposed
architecture.

approach to cooperative tracking of cyclists using smart devices and
infrastructure-based sensors. A smart device is carried by the cyclists and an
intersection is equipped with a wide angle stereo camera system. Two tracking
models are presented and compared. The first model is based on the stereo
camera system detections only, whereas the second model cooperatively combines
the camera based detections with velocity and yaw rate data provided by the
smart device. Our aim is to overcome limitations of tracking approaches based
on single data sources. We show in numerical evaluations on scenes where
cyclists are starting or turning right that the cooperation leads to an
improvement in both the ability to keep track of a cyclist and the accuracy of
the track particularly when it comes to occlusions in the visual system. We,
therefore, contribute to the safety of vulnerable road users in future traffic.

adaptively learn the spatial-temporal correlation features and long temporal
interdependence of multi-modality traffic data by an attention auxiliary

characteristics of multi-modality traffic data, the base module of our method
consists of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN) and Gated

the local trend features and the latter is to capture the long temporal

proposed by Simonov et al. This strategy is an alternative to the traditional
periodic (time-based) metering where the power demand is averaged in fixed time
periods (e.g. every 15 minutes). The event-based approach considers two
thresholds that trigger an event, one related to the (instantaneous) power
demanded, other to the accumulated energy consumed. The original work assumed
these thresholds fixed for the measurements. Our present contribution relaxes
this assumption by proposing a method to set the thresholds from the percentage
of the peak power consumption over the period under analysis. This approach, in
contrast to the time-based and the fixed thresholds, better captures the actual
power demanded when different households with diverse power demand profiles are
studied. In this sense, our method provides a more efficient way to store
electricity demand data while maintaining the estimation error (in relation to
the real-time power demand) under acceptable values. Numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the advantage and possible drawbacks of the proposed

surprising dependence of the mean swimming velocity on the kinematic viscosity
of the fluid. The net flow pattern is calculated as a function of kinematic

adopting nonlinear PE is then manifested from the transient phase shift either
abrupt at the point of diffuse surface scattering or gradual during
phonon-phonon or phonon-electron scattering events based on which the ratio of
nonlinear to linear PE coefficient is experimentally extracted as a function of
the detection probe energy, reaching 0.98 slightly below the bandgap. As the
probing energy is rather set away from the bandgap, AC phase is completely
invariant with any scattering events, exhibiting the conventional trend at
Brillouin frequency in linear regime. Under potent influence of nonlinear PE,
the AC dephasing time during the propagation are quantified as a function of AC

MISO wiretap channel, which consists of a M-antenna transmitter, a
single-antenna receiver, and a two-antenna eavesdropper. This type of
eavesdropper, by adopting an optimal Grassmann manifold (OGM) filtering
structure, can reduce the maximum achievable secrecy rate (MASR) to be zero by
using only two receive antennas, regardless of the number of antennas at the
transmitter. Specifically, the eavesdropper exploits linear filters to serially
recover the legitimate information symbols and intends to find the optimal
filter that minimizes the meansquare error (MSE) in estimating the symbols.
During the process, a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with
constraints on the filter matrix can be formulated and solved. Interestingly,
the resulted optimal filters constitute a complex Grassmann manifold on the
matrix space. Based on the filters, a novel expression of MASR is derived and
further verified to be zero under the noiseless environment. Besides this, an
achievable variable region (AVR) that induces zero MASR is presented
analytically in the noisy case. Numerical results are provided to illustrate
the huge disaster in the respect of secrecy rate.

their ability to exploit the translation invariance that is inherent in many
learning problems. Recently, it was shown that CNNs can exploit other
invariances, such as rotation invariance, by using group convolutions instead
of planar convolutions. However, for reasons of performance and ease of
implementation, it has been necessary to limit the group convolution to
transformations that can be applied to the filters without interpolation. Thus,
for images with square pixels, only integer translations, rotations by
multiples of 90 degrees, and reflections are admissible.
  Whereas the square tiling provides a 4-fold rotational symmetry, a hexagonal
tiling of the plane has a 6-fold rotational symmetry. In this paper we show how
one can efficiently implement planar convolution and group convolution over
hexagonal lattices, by re-using existing highly optimized convolution routines.
We find that, due to the reduced anisotropy of hexagonal filters, planar
HexaConv provides better accuracy than planar convolution with square filters,
given a fixed parameter budget. Furthermore, we find that the increased degree
of symmetry of the hexagonal grid increases the effectiveness of group
convolutions, by allowing for more parameter sharing. We show that our method
significantly outperforms conventional CNNs on the AID aerial scene

secondary transitions that lead to clustering and more complex spatially

spaced arrays of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide.
We find that, for low excitation numbers, the modal properties are

decay rate of the most subradiant modes obeys a universal scaling with a cubic
suppression in the number of emitters. Multi-excitation subradiant eigenstates
can be built from fermionic combinations of single excitation eigenstates; such
""fermionization"" results in multiple excitations that spatially repel one
another. We put forward a method to efficiently create and measure such
subradiant states, which can be realized with superconducting qubits. These
measurement protocols probe both real-space correlations (using on-site

Let $\mathbb K(X)$ denote the
space of discrete Radon measures on $X$. Let $\mu$ be a completely random
discrete measure on $X$, i.e., $\mu$ is (the distribution of) a completely
random measure on $X$ that is concentrated on $\mathbb K(X)$. We consider the
multiplicative (current) group $C_0(X\to\mathbb R_+)$ consisting of functions
on $X$ that take values in $\mathbb R_+=(0,\infty)$ and are equal to 1 outside
a compact set. Each element $\theta\in C_0(X\to\mathbb R_+)$ maps $\mathbb
K(X)$ onto itself; more precisely, $\theta$ sends a discrete Radon measure
$\sum_i s_i\delta_{x_i}$ to $\sum_i \theta(s_i)s_i\delta_{x_i}$. Thus, elements
of $C_0(X\to\mathbb R_+)$ transform the weights of discrete Radon measures. We
study conditions under which the measure $\mu$ is quasi-invariant under the
action of the current group $C_0(X\to\mathbb R_+)$ and consider several classes
of examples. We further assume that $X=\mathbb R^d$ and consider the group of
local diffeomorphisms $\operatorname{Diff}_0(X)$. Elements of this group also
map $\mathbb K(X)$ onto itself. More precisely, a diffeomorphism $\varphi\in
\operatorname{Diff}_0(X)$ sends a discrete Radon measure $\sum_i
s_i\delta_{x_i}$ to $\sum_i s_i\delta_{\varphi(x_i)}$. Thus, diffeomorphisms
from $\operatorname{Diff}_0(X)$ transform the atoms of discrete Radon measures.
We study quasi-invariance of $\mu$ under the action of
$\operatorname{Diff}_0(X)$. We finally consider the semidirect product
$\mathfrak G:=\operatorname{Diff}_0(X)\times C_0(X\to \mathbb R_+)$ and study
conditions of quasi-invariance and partial quasi-invariance of $\mu$ under the

neural networks, in particular Restricted Boltzmann Machines, in order to model
complex quantum states of many-body systems [Science, 355(6325), 2017]. States
represented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to
display interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture
long-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network
representation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem
has been addressed with stochastic optimization techniques. In this work we
explore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary quantum
operations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum
operations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted
Boltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network
parameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal
quantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum
circuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden
nodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the
circuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained
with different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no
general and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted
description of quantum states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a
step-wise procedure based on the projection of Unrestricted quantum states to
Restricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to perform this
projection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible
to approximately optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on
stochastic methods such as Variational Monte Carlo, which are computationally
expensive.

that a vulnerability exists when no vulnerability has been discovered. Failing
to discover a vulnerability, does not mean that none exists---even if the
fuzzer was run for a week (or a year). Hence, testing provides no formal
correctness guarantees.
  In this article, I establish an unexpected connection with the otherwise
unrelated scientific field of ecology, and introduce a statistical framework
that models Software Testing and Analysis as Discovery of Species (STADS). For
instance, in order to study the species diversity of arthropods in a tropical
rain forest, ecologists would first sample a large number of individuals from

observed in the sample to properties of the whole forest. The estimation (i) of

three decades of research in ecological biostatistics to address the
fundamental extrapolation challenge for automated test generation. Our
preliminary empirical study demonstrates a good estimator performance even for
a fuzzer with adaptive sampling bias---AFL, a state-of-the-art vulnerability
detection tool. The STADS framework provides statistical correctness guarantees

decomposition formalism for computing the anisotropic bispectrum in redshift
space and for measuring it from galaxy samples. Our formalism uses tri-polar
spherical harmonic decomposition with zero total angular momentum to compress
the 3D modes distribution in the redshift-space bispectrum. This approach
preserves three fundamental properties of the Universe: statistical
homogeneity, isotropy, and parity-symmetry, allowing us to efficiently separate
the anisotropic signal induced by redshift-space distortions (RSDs) and the
Alcock-Paczy\'{n}ski (AP) effect from the isotropic bispectrum. The relevant
expansion coefficients in terms of the anisotropic signal are reduced to one
multipole index $L$, and the $L> 0$ modes are induced only by the RSD or AP
effects. Our formalism has two advantages: (1) we can make use of Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) to measure the bispectrum; (2) it gives a simple expression

terms quadratic in the inverse Planck energy. From the investigation of time
delay and dual curvature lensing we deduce that, because of these differences,
in the Snyder case the properties of the detector are essential for the
observation of relative locality effects. The deviations from special
relativity do not depend on the energy of the particles and are much smaller

we recall a few known ones. We show these models to be more related than
commonly understood, around two main principles: deniability and permutation.
In particular, randomized response turns out to be very modern in spite of it
having been introduced over 50 years ago: it is a local anonymization method
and it allows understanding the protection offered by $\epsilon$-differential
privacy when $\epsilon$ is increased to improve utility. A similar
understanding on the effect of large $\epsilon$ in terms of deniability is
obtained from the connection between $\epsilon$-differential privacy and
t-closeness. Finally, the post-randomization method (PRAM) is shown to be
viewable as permutation and to be connected with randomized response and
differential privacy. Since the latter is also connected with t-closeness, it
follows that the permutation principle can explain the guarantees offered by
all those models. Thus, calibrating permutation is very relevant in
anonymization, and we conclude by sketching two ways of doing it.

  We find that the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin scheme shows a

results are markedly different from results obtained in the asymptotic regime

""Rigorous"" workflow is an exhaustive exploration of the potential energy

the ""Diverse"" workflow produces a maximally diverse set of structures. The

English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields
improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations,
respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position
representations yields no further improvement in translation quality. We
describe an efficient implementation of our method and cast it as an instance
of relation-aware self-attention mechanisms that can generalize to arbitrary
graph-labeled inputs.

transparently handling problems much larger than the high-bandwidth memory
without significant performance penalties. (2) Pipelining of communication and
computation phases of successive subspaces is implemented to hide communication
costs without extra memory traffic.

special focus on its hitherto unknown strengths and weaknesses. It is shown
that this protocol can be used for secure direct quantum communication.
Further, the implementability of this protocol in the realistic situation is
analyzed by considering various Markovian noise models. It is found that the
Kak's protocol and its variants in their original form can be implemented only
in a restricted class of noisy channels, where the protocols can be transformed
to corresponding protocols based on logical qubits in decoherence free
subspace. Specifically, it is observed that Kak's protocol can be implemented
in the presence of collective rotation and collective dephasing noise, but
cannot be implemented in its original form in the presence of other types of
noise, like amplitude damping and phase damping noise. Further, the performance
of the protocol in the noisy environment is quantified by computing average
fidelity under various noise models, and subsequently a set of preferred states
for secure communication in noisy environment have also been identified.

  Markets",,,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The deployment of distributed energy resources, combined with a more
proactive demand side, is inducing a new paradigm in power system operation and
electricity markets. Within a consumer-centric market framework, peer-to-peer
approaches have gained substantial interest. Peer-to-peer markets rely on
multi-bilateral direct negotiation among all players to match supply and
demand, and with product differentiation. These markets can yield a complete
mapping of exchanges onto the grid, hence allowing to rethink our approach to
sharing costs related to usage of common infrastructure and services. We
propose here to attribute such costs in a number of alternative ways that
reflects different views on usage of the grid and on cost allocation, i.e.,
uniformly and based on the electrical distance between players. Since
attribution mechanisms are defined in an exogenous manner and made transparent
they eventually affect the trades of the market participants and related grid
usage. The interest of our approach is illustrated on a test case using the
IEEE 39 bus test system, underlying the impact of attribution mechanisms on
trades and grid usage.

outburst after the main June 2015 event. We monitored this re-brightening with
the INTEGRAL and Swift satellites, and in this paper we report the results of
the time-resolved spectral analysis of these data. The December outburst shared
similar characteristics with the June one. The well sampled INTEGRAL light
curve shows up to 10 Crab flares, which are separated by relatively weak
non-flaring emission phases when compared to the June outburst. The spectra are
well described by absorbed Comptonization models, with hard photon indices,
$\Gamma \lesssim 2$, and significant detections of a high-energy cut-off only
during the bright flares. This is in contrast to the June outburst, where the
Comptonization models gave electron temperatures mostly in the 30--50 keV
range, while some spectra were soft ($\Gamma \sim 2.5$) without signs of any
spectral cut-off. Similarly to the June outburst, we see clear sings of a
variable local absorber in the soft energy band covered by Swift/XRT and
INTEGRAL/JEM-X, which causes rapid spectral variations observed during the
flares. During one flare, both Swift and INTEGRAL captured V404 Cyg in a state
where the absorber was nearly Compton thick, $N_\textrm{H} \approx
10^{24}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, and the broad band spectrum was similar to obscured
AGN spectra, as seen during the ""plateaus"" in the June outburst. We conclude
that the spectral behaviour of V404 Cyg during the December outburst was
analogous with the first few days of the June outburst, both having hard X-ray
flares that were intermittently influenced by obscuration due to nearly
Compton-thick outflows launched from the accretion disc.

We have carried out a stability and bifurcation analysis of the order-disorder

magnetic and non-magnetic atoms can act as perfect spin filters for particles
with arbitrary spin state. This can be achieved by introducing minimal
quasi-one dimensionality in the basic structural units building up the array,
along with an appropriate tuning of the potential of the non-magnetic atoms,
the tunnel hopping integral between the non-magnetic atoms and the backbone,
and, in some cases, by tuning an external magnetic field. This latter result
opens up the interesting possibility of designing a flux controlled spin
demultiplexer using quantum networks. The proposed networks have close
resemblance with a family of recently developed photonic lattices, and the
scheme for spin filtering can thus be linked, in principle, to a possibility of
suppressing any one of the two states of polarization of a single photon,
almost at will. We use transfer matrices and a real space renormalization group
scheme to unravel the conditions under which any aperiodic arrangement of such
topologically different structures will filter out any given spin projection.
Our results are analytically exact, and corroborated by extensive numerical
calculations of the spin polarized transmission and the density of states of
such systems.

have been picked up by both historians (Jeremy Gray) and mathematicians (Frank
Quinn).
  We argue that Klein and Hilbert, both at Goettingen, were not adversaries but
rather modernist allies in a bid to broaden the scope of mathematics beyond a
narrow focus on arithmetized analysis as practiced by the Berlin school.
  Klein's Goettingen lecture and other texts shed light on Klein's modernism.
Hilbert's views on intuition are closer to Klein's views than Mehrtens is
willing to allow. Klein and Hilbert were equally interested in the
axiomatisation of physics. Among Klein's credits is helping launch the career
of Abraham Fraenkel, and advancing the careers of Sophus Lie, Emmy Noether, and
Ernst Zermelo, all four surely of impeccable modernist credentials.
  Mehrtens' unsourced claim that Hilbert was interested in production rather
than meaning appears to stem from Mehrtens' marxist leanings. Mehrtens' claim
that [the future SS-Brigadefuehrer] ""Theodor Vahlen ... cited Klein's racist
distinctions within mathematics, and sharpened them into open antisemitism""
fabricates a spurious continuity between the two figures mentioned and is thus
an odious misrepresentation of Klein's position.

Hydrogen Balmer absorption lines in their spectra. We present a comprehensive
study of the origin of strong Balmer lines in a volume-limited sample of 189
galaxies with $0.01<z<0.05$, $\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})>9.5$ and
projected axis ratio $b/a>0.32$. We explore their structural properties,
environments, emission lines and star formation histories, and compare them to
control samples of star-forming and quiescent galaxies, and simulated galaxy
mergers. Excluding contaminants, in which the strong Balmer lines are most
likely caused by dust-star geometry, we find evidence for three different
pathways through the post-starburst phase, with most events occurring in
intermediate-density environments: (1) a significant disruptive event, such as
a gas-rich major merger, causing a starburst and growth of a spheroidal
component, followed by quenching of the star formation (70% of post-starburst
galaxies at $9.5<\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})<10.5$ and 60% at
$\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})>10.5$); (2) at
$9.5<\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})<10.5$, stochastic star formation
in blue-sequence galaxies, causing a weak burst and subsequent return to the
blue sequence (30%); (3) at $\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})>10.5$,
cyclic evolution of quiescent galaxies which gradually move towards the
high-mass end of the red sequence through weak starbursts, possibly as a result
of a merger with a smaller gas-rich companion (40%). Our analysis suggests that
AGN are `on' for $50%$ of the duration of the post-starburst phase, meaning
that traditional samples of post-starburst galaxies with strict emission line
cuts will be at least $50%$ incomplete due to the exclusion of narrow-line AGN.

a finite accuracy which might influence the state convergence. This work shows,
what bounds on optimization accuracy are required to achieve prescribed
stability margins. Simulation studies support the claim that optimization

remains a mystery after two decades of research of quantum Hamiltonian
complexity; it is only known to be contained in NP for few low parameters. Of
particular interest is the tightly related question of understanding whether
groundstates of CLHs can be generated by efficient quantum circuits. The two
problems touch upon conceptual, physical and computational questions, including
the centrality of non-commutation in quantum mechanics, quantum PCP and the
area law. It is natural to try to address first the more physical case of CLHs
embedded on a 2D lattice but this problem too remained open, apart from some
very specific cases. Here we consider a wide class of two dimensional CLH
instances; these are $k$-local CLHs, for any constant $k$; they are defined on
qubits set on the edges of any surface complex, where we require that this
surface complex is not too far from being ""Euclidean"". Each vertex and each
face can be associated with an arbitrary term (as long as the terms commute).
We show that this class is in NP, and moreover that the groundstates have an
efficient quantum circuit that prepares them. This result subsumes that of
Schuch [2011] which regarded the special case of $4$-local Hamiltonians on a
grid with qubits, and by that it removes the mysterious feature of Schuch's
proof which showed containment in NP without providing a quantum circuit for
the groundstate and considerably generalizes it. We believe this work and the
tools we develop make a significant step towards showing that 2D CLHs are in
NP.

this degradation as near optimal for a large class of natural algorithms. We
conclude with a preliminary investigation of the performance of these

consuming . One way to alleviate this problem is active learning, which aims to
which discover the most valuable instances for labeling to construct a powerful
classifier. Considering both informativeness and representativeness provides a
promising way to design a practical active learning. However, most existing
active learning methods select instances favoring either informativeness or
representativeness. Meanwhile, many are designed based on the binary class, so
that they may present suboptimal solutions on the datasets with multiple
classes. In this paper, a hybrid informative and representative criterion based
multi-class active learning approach is proposed. We combine the informative
informativeness and representativeness into one formula, which can be solved
under a unified framework. The informativeness is measured by the margin
minimum while the representative information is measured by the maximum mean
discrepancy. By minimizing the upper bound for the true risk, we generalize the
empirical risk minimization principle to the active learning setting.
Simultaneously, our proposed method makes full use of the label information,
and the proposed active learning is designed based on multiple classes. So the
proposed method is not suitable to the binary class but also the multiple
classes. We conduct our experiments on twelve benchmark UCI data sets, and the
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than
some state-of-the-art methods.

the problem of fluid turbulence: ""Nobody in physics has really been able to
analyze it mathematically satisfactorily in spite of its importance to the

Unbeknownst to him, Lars Onsager decades earlier had made an exact mathematical
analysis of the high Reynolds-number limit of incompressible fluid turbulence,
using a method that would now be described as a non-perturbative
renormalization group analysis and discovering the first ""conservation-law
anomaly"" in theoretical physics. Onsager's results were only cryptically
announced in 1949 and he never published any of his detailed calculations.
Onsager's analysis was finally rescued from oblivion and reproduced by this
author in 1992. The ideas have subsequently been intensively developed in the
mathematical PDE community, where deep connections emerged with John Nash's
work on isometric embeddings. Furthermore, Onsager's method has more recently
been successfully applied to new physics problems, such as compressible fluid
turbulence and relativistic fluid turbulence, yielding many novel testable
predictions. This note will explain Onsager's exact analysis of incompressible
turbulence using modern ideas on renormalization group and conservation-law
anomalies, and it will also very briefly review subsequent developments.

a 2.27-d orbit around a V = 12.9, K2 star which shows a 21-d rotational
modulation. WASP-145Ab is a 0.89 Mj planet in a 1.77-d orbit with a grazing
transit, which means that the planetary radius is not well constrained. The
host is a V = 11.5, K2 star with a companion 5 arcsecs away and 1.4 mags
fainter. WASP-158b is a relatively massive planet at 2.8 Mj with a radius of
1.1 Rj and a 3.66-d orbit. It transits a V = 12.1, F6 star. WASP-159b is a
bloated hot Jupiter (1.4 Rj and 0.55 Mj) in a 3.8-d orbit around a V = 12.9, F9
star. WASP-162b is a massive planet in a relatively long and highly eccentric
orbit (5.2 Mj, P = 9.6 d, e = 0.43). It transits a V = 12.2, K0 star. WASP-168b
is a bloated hot Jupiter (0.42 Mj, 1.5 Rj) in a 4.15-d orbit with a grazing
transit. The host is a V = 12.1, F9 star. WASP-172b is a bloated hot Jupiter
(0.5 Mj; 1.6 Rj) in a 5.48-d orbit around a V = 11.0, F1 star. It is likely to
be the best planet of those reported here for atmospheric characterisation.
WASP-173Ab is a massive planet (3.7 Mj) with a 1.2 Rj radius in a circular
orbit with a period of 1.39 d. The host is a V = 11.3, G3 star, being the
brighter component of the double-star system WDS23366-3437, with a companion 6
arcsecs away and 0.8 mags fainter. One of the two stars shows a rotational
modulation of 7.9 d.

taken into account at the algorithm design stage. In order to limit the system
complexity, a fixed analog beamformer is used at both sides of the
communication links. The obtained numerical results, showing the accuracy in
the estimation of the channel matrix dominant singular vectors, the system

proposed algorithms are effective, and that they compare favorably, in terms of
the performance-complexity trade-off, with respect to several competing

scales the uncertainty of a measurement based on how consistent it is with the

starts with a formal core language for task planning that allows expressing
rich temporal specifications and uses a semantic parser to provide a natural

automatically constructed plan of the task in a graphical user interface. This
allows the user to resolve potentially ambiguous interpretations. Flipper
extends itself via naturalization: its users can add definitions for

language. Flipper improves the naturalization by generalizing the definition
provided by users. Unlike other task-specification systems, Flipper enables
natural language interactions while maintaining the expressive power and formal
precision of a programming language. We show through an initial user study that
natural language interactions and generalization can considerably ease the
description of tasks. Moreover, over time, users employ more and more concepts
outside of the initial core language. Such extensions are available to the
Flipper community, and users can use concepts that others have defined.

conditions satisfied by limiting vorticities and limiting induced magnetic
fields of solutions of the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau equations as shown by
Sandier-Serfaty. Let us recall that they obtained that $|\nabla h|$ is
continuous in $\Omega$. We prove that if $x_0$ in $ \Omega$ belongs to $\supp

convey information on a range of parameters including nanosheet size and defect
content. By contrast, the equivalent spectra for h-BN are relatively simple,
with both the absorption and Raman spectra consisting of a single feature each,
disclosing relatively little information. Here, the ability to size-select
liquid-exfoliated h-BN nanosheets has allowed us to comprehensively study the
dependence of h-BN optical spectra on nanosheet dimensions. We find the optical
extinction coefficient spectrum to vary systematically with nanosheet lateral
size due to the presence of light scattering. Conversely, once light scattering
has been decoupled to give the optical absorbance spectra, we find the size
dependence to be mostly removed save for a weak but well-defined variation in
energy of peak absorbance with nanosheet thickness. This finding is
corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations,
which include electron correlations and quasiparticle self-consistency (QSGW).
In addition, while we find the position of the sole h-BN Raman line to be
invariant with nanosheet dimensions, the linewidth appears to vary weakly with
nanosheet thickness. These size-dependent spectroscopic properties can be used
as metrics to estimate nanosheet thickness from spectroscopic data.

a frame by frame classification of the MHIs, we are able to detect starting

starting motions 0.506 s on average after the bicycle starts moving with an

temperatures. The results were obtained from Rietveld refinement using
high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns and from Raman
spectroscopic measurements. The small-cage occupancies of methane in the
deuterated hydrates are found to be slightly higher than in the hydrogenated
form, likely due to their different lattice constants. The CH4 occupancy in the
small cages agrees fairly well with the predictions of CSMGem at the formation
pressure of 3.5 MPa, but with the increasing formation pressure the
disagreement grows up to 11 percent. While some deficiency of the prediction
model cannot be excluded, the observed discrepancy may well be due to
experimental difficulties of reaching true equilibrium at higher pressures. The
experimentally determined large-to-small cage occupancy ratios of the synthetic

higher than the results of CSMGem calculations. Possible reasons for these
discrepancies will be discussed.

  Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC 2018)",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Superior performance and ease of implementation have fostered the adoption of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for a wide array of inference and

and pointwise nonlinearity. Since the two first operations are well-defined
only on regular-structured data such as audio or images, application of CNNs to
contemporary datasets where the information is defined in irregular domains is
challenging. This paper investigates CNNs architectures to operate on signals
whose support can be modeled using a graph. Architectures that replace the
regular convolution with a so-called linear shift-invariant graph filter have
been recently proposed. This paper goes one step further and, under the
framework of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) graph filters, imposes
additional structure on the adopted graph filters, to obtain three new (more
parsimonious) architectures. The proposed architectures result in a lower
number of model parameters, reducing the computational complexity, facilitating
the training, and mitigating the risk of overfitting. Simulations show that the
proposed simpler architectures achieve similar performance as more complex
models.

Hadron Collider Experiments. The method improves the classic lepton energy
calibration procedure widely used at hadron collider experiments. The classic
method parameterizes the potential bias in the lepton en- ergy calibration, and
determines the value of the parameter by the invariant mass of
$Z/\gamma^*\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ events. The precision of the calibration
is dominated by the number of parameters or terms consid- ered in the
parameterization, for example, a polynomial extension. With one physics
constraint of the reconstructed Z boson mass, the classic procedure can use and
determine one parameter. The novel method improves the precision of lepton
calibration by introducing more terms in the parameterization. To precisely
determine the values of multiple parameters, the method first ac- quires more
constraints by separating the $Z/\gamma^*\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ samples
according to the decay kinematics, and then reduces the correlation between
multiple parameters. Since the new method is still using the reconstructed Z
boson masses as the only constraints, it is much faster and easier than
detailed study of detector simulations.

may be due to an increasingly spherical mass distribution (which is not

Hoag's Object. Here the mass of the central galaxy may be comparable to the
mass of the ring, making it a difficult case to model mechanically. In a
previous paper, it was shown that the outer potential of a torus (ring) can be
represented with good accuracy by the potential of a massive circle with the
same mass. This approach allows us to simplify the problem of the particle
motion in the gravitational field of a torus associated with a central mass by
replacing the torus with a massive circle. In such a system there is a circle
of unstable equilibrium that we call ""Lagrangian circle"" (LC). Stable circular
orbits exist only in some region limited by the last possible circular orbit
related to the disappearance of the extrema of the effective potential. We call
this orbit ""the outermost stable circular orbit"" (OSCO) by analogy with the
innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in the relativistic case of a black
hole. Under these conditions, there is a region between OSCO and LC where the
circular motion is not possible due to the competition between the
gravitational forces by the central mass and the ring. As a result, a gap in
the matter distribution can form in Hoag-like system with massive rings.

the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these
relationships, we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy

additionally amenable to proximal optimization by augmenting the objective with
a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. We find that the ability to
learn both a mean and covariance during training leads to significantly
improved results on standard continuous control benchmarks.

challenges to Taobao's RS: scalability, sparsity and cold start. In this paper,
we present our technical solutions to address these three challenges. The
methods are based on the graph embedding framework. We first construct an item
graph from users' behavior history. Each item is then represented as a vector
using graph embedding. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise
similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation
process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is
incorporated into the embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods
to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information.
Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating
side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the
platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to
process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using online A/B test, we show that
the online Click-Through-Rate (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous
recommendation methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the
effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao's live

violate conservation laws in individual experiments. Despite these appearances,
strict conservation of momentum, orbital angular momentum, and energy can be
shown to be consistent with the assumption that the entangling interactions
that constitute measurements induce a real collapse of the wave function. The
essential idea is that measured systems always have some pre-existing
entanglement relations with (usually larger) systems, and that apparent changes
in conserved quantities in the measured system are correlated with compensating
changes in these larger systems. Since wave function collapse is mediated by
entanglement relations a full accounting of the relevant quantities requires a
computation over all interacting, entangled systems. The demonstrations by
Gemmer and Mahler[1], and by Durt[2,3], that entanglement is a generic result
of interaction are central to the argument. A stochastic collapse equation
based on interaction potentials is described and shown to guarantee
conservation of the relevant quantities at all stages of evolution.

It was later observed that there is a close connection between such sonar
techniques and wavelet decomposition for multiresolution analysis. Motivated by
this, we formalize the original Altes waveforms as a family of hyperbolic
chirplets suitable for the detection of accelerating time-series oscillations.
The formalism results in a remarkably flexible set of wavelets with desirable
properties of admissibility, regularity, vanishing moments, and time-frequency
localization. These ""Altes wavelets"" also facilitate efficient implementation
of the scale invariant hyperbolic chirplet transform (HCT).
  From a practical perspective, log-periodic oscillations with an acceleration
towards criticality can serve as indicators of an incipient bifurcation. Such
signals abound in nature, often as precursors to phase transitions in the
non-linear dynamics of complex systems. For example, the authors' interest lies
in automatic detection of the well documented phenomenon of log-periodic price
dynamics during financial bubbles and preceding market crashes. However, the
methodology presented here is more widely applicable in such diverse domains as
prediction of critical failures in mechanical systems, and fault detection in

observe a rather clear signal from the QGP radiation. We, furthermore, study
the $p_T$-spectra and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of single electrons at different

form as the equation for waves on infinitely deep water; the latter had been
proposed by Babenko and studied in detail by Buffoni, Dancer and Toland.
Instead of the $2 \pi$-periodic Hilbert transform $\mathcal{C}$ used in the
equation for deep water, the equation obtained here contains a certain operator
$\mathcal{B}_r$, which is the sum of $\mathcal{C}$ and a compact operator whose
dependence on the parameter involves on the depth of water. Numerical
computations are based on an equivalent form of Babenko's equation derived by
virtue of the spectral decomposition of the operator $\mathcal{B}_r \D / \D t$.
Bifurcation curves and wave profiles of the extreme form are obtained
numerically.

and time dilation are derived using a modified distance formula that is
appropriate for discrete space. This new distance formula is different than the
Pythagorean theorem but converges to it for distances large relative to the
Planck length. First, four candidate formulas developed by different people
over the last 70 years will be discussed. Three of the formulas are shown to be
identical for conditions that best describe discrete space. It is shown that
this new distance formula is valid for all size-scales -- from the Planck
length upwards -- and solves two major problems historically associated with
the discrete space-time (DST) model. One problem it solves is the widely
believed anisotropic nature of most discrete space models. Just as commonly
believed is the second problem -- the incompatibility of DST's concept of an
immutable atom of space and the length contraction of this atom required by
special relativity. The new formula for distance in DST solves this problem. It
is shown that length contraction of the atom of space does not occur for any
relative velocity of two reference frames. It is also shown that time dilation
of the atom of time does not occur. Also discussed is the possibility of any
object being able to travel at the speed of light for specific temporal
durations given by an equation derived in this work. Also discussed is a method
to empirical verify the discreteness of space by studying any observed
anomalies in the motion of astronomical bodies, such as differences in the
bodies' inertial masses and gravitational masses. The importance of the new
distance formula for causal set theory and other theories of quantum gravity is
also discussed.

real economy and stock market dynamics and describes a mechanism that can
generate economic fluctuations consistent with observed business cycles. To
this end, we seek to incorporate into the macroeconomic framework a dynamic
stock market model based on opinion interactions (Gusev et al., 2015). We
derive this model from microfoundations, provide its empirical verification,
demonstrate that it contains the efficient market as a particular regime and
establish a link through which macroeconomic models can be attached for the
study of real economy and stock market interaction. To examine key effects, we
link it with a simple macroeconomic model (Blanchard, 1981). The coupled system
generates nontrivial endogenous dynamics, which exhibit deterministic and
stochastic features, producing quasiperiodic fluctuations (business cycles). We
also inspect this system's behavior in the phase space. The real economy and
the stock market coevolve dynamically along the path governed by a
stochastically-forced dynamical system with two stable equilibria, one where
the economy expands and the other where it contracts, resulting in business
cycles identified as the coherence resonance phenomenon. Thus, the
incorporation of stock market dynamics into the macroeconomic framework, as
presented here, allows the derivation of realistic behaviors in a tractable
setting.

largely hinges on the timely integration of digital technology into upcoming as

infrastructure and transportation agencies that manage V2I-focused applications
must be able to collect, process, distribute, and archive these data quickly,
reliably, and securely. This paper focuses on V2I applications and investigates
current digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the
importance of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment
in more traditional transportation infrastructure to keep up with the auto
industry push toward increasing intervehicular communication. By studying
current CV testbeds and smart-city initiatives, this paper identifies digital
infrastructure being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies
limited budgeting for digital infrastructure and finds that current expenditure
is inadequate for realizing the potential benefits of V2I applications.
Finally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review of
current practices and future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for

establishing national and international platforms for the planning, deployment,

nonlinear magnetization behavior of nanoparticles in an applied magnetic field

Finding a sufficiently accurate model for the particle behavior is still an
open problem. For this reason the reconstruction is still computed using a
measured forward operator which is obtained in a time-consuming calibration
process. The state of the art model used for the imaging methodology and first
model-based reconstructions relies on strong model simplifications which turned
out to cause too large modeling errors. Neglecting particle-particle

a navigation control system (NCS) that triggers random changes in the direction
of self-propulsion of the robots. The internal state of the NCS is described by
a Boolean variable that adopts two values. The temporal dynamics of this
Boolean variable is dictated by a closed Markov chain -- ensuring the absence
of fixed points in the dynamics -- with transition rates that may depend
exclusively on the instantaneous, local value of the external field.
Importantly, the NCS does not store past measurements of this value in
continuous, internal variables. We show that, despite the strong constraints,
it is possible to conceive closed Markov chain motifs that lead to nontrivial
motility behaviors of the MR in one, two and three dimensions. By analytically
reducing the complexity of the NCS dynamics, we obtain an effective description
of the long-time motility behavior of the MR that allows us to identify the
minimum requirements in the design of NCS motifs and transition rates to
perform complex navigation tasks such as adaptive gradient following, detection
of minima or maxima, or selection of a desired value in a dynamical, external
field. We put these ideas in practice by assembling a robot that operates by
the proposed minimalistic NCS to evaluate the robustness of MR, providing a
proof-of-concept that is possible to navigate through complex information
landscapes with such a simple NCS whose internal state can be stored in one

  be released by IEEE",,,,"cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  When considering simulation-based verification of processors, the current
trend is to generate stimuli using pseudorandom generators (PRGs), apply them
to the processor inputs and monitor the achieved coverage of its functionality
in order to determine verification completeness. Stimuli can have different
forms, for example, they can be represented by bit vectors applied to the input
ports of the processor or by programs that are loaded directly into the program
memory. In this paper, we propose a new technique dynamically altering
constraints for PRG via recurrent neural network, which receives a coverage
feedback from the simulation of design under verification. For the
demonstration purposes we used processors provided by Codasip as their coverage
state space is reasonably big and differs for various kinds of processors.
Nevertheless, techniques presented in this paper are widely applicable. The
results of experiments show that not only the coverage closure is achieved much
sooner, but we are able to isolate a small set of stimuli with high coverage
that can be used for running regression tests.

  Inference Engine",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AR cs.CV eess.IV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in computer vision and
machine learning. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art networks are extremely
compute and memory intensive which makes them unsuitable for mW-devices such as
IoT end-nodes. Aggressive quantization of these networks dramatically reduces
the computation and memory footprint. Binary-weight neural networks (BWNs)
follow this trend, pushing weight quantization to the limit. Hardware
accelerators for BWNs presented up to now have focused on core efficiency,
disregarding I/O bandwidth and system-level efficiency that are crucial for
deployment of accelerators in ultra-low power devices. We present Hyperdrive: a
BWN accelerator dramatically reducing the I/O bandwidth exploiting a novel
binary-weight streaming approach, which can be used for arbitrarily sized
convolutional neural network architecture and input resolution by exploiting
the natural scalability of the compute units both at chip-level and
system-level by arranging Hyperdrive chips systolically in a 2D mesh while
processing the entire feature map together in parallel. Hyperdrive achieves 4.3
TOp/s/W system-level efficiency (i.e., including I/Os)---3.1x higher than
state-of-the-art BWN accelerators, even if its core uses resource-intensive
FP16 arithmetic for increased robustness.

species for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the DRGEP method
is developed. The accuracy and effectiveness of this RII method is validated
for two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol. The RII method determines appropriate
DRGEP target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the
simulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the RII method
reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP target species sets
appropriate to the combustion phenomena under consideration. Constant volume
autoignition simulations run over a wide range of initial condi- tions using
detailed reaction mechanisms for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the RII
method is able to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species
sets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target species sets.
Additionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the RII method are compared to
those of static target species sets in single-cell engine simulations under
homogeneous charge compression ignition conditions. For simulations using more
stringent DRGEP thresholds, the RII method performs similarly to that of the
static target species sets. With a larger DRGEP threshold, the RII method is
significantly more accurate than the static target species sets without
imposing significant computational overhead. Furthermore, the applicability of
the RII method to a DRG-based DAC scheme is discussed.
