Backgrounds are significantly reduced compared to previous measurements made at
lower energies through the use of new forward shower counters. The products of
the cross-sections and the branching fractions for the decays to dimuons, where
both muons are within the pseudorapidity range $2.0<\eta<4.5$, are measured to
be $$
  \begin{array}{rcl} \sigma_{J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}&=&435 \pm 18 \pm 17
\pm 16 {\rm \ pb},\\ \sigma_{\psi(2S)\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}&=&11.1 \pm 1.1 \pm
0.3 \pm 0.4 {\rm \ pb}.\\ \end{array} $$ The first uncertainties are
statistical, the second are systematic, and the third are due to the luminosity
determination. The cross-sections are also measured differentially for meson
rapidities between 2.0 and 4.5. Good agreement is observed with theoretical
predictions. Photoproduction cross-sections are derived and compared to
previous experiments, and a deviation from a pure power-law extrapolation of
lower energy data is observed.

$In 1991, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis gave a reduction implying the
$\NP$-hardness of approximating the problem $\threesat$ with bounded
occurrences. Their reduction is based on expander graphs. We present an
analogue of this result for the second level of the polynomial-time hierarchy
based on superconcentrator graphs. This resolves an open question of Ko and Lin
(1995) and should be useful in deriving inapproximability results in the
polynomial-time hierarchy.
  More precisely, we show that given an instance of $\gapthreesat$ in which
every variable occurs at most $\Bsat$ times (for some absolute constant
$\Bsat$), it is $\Pi_2$-hard to distinguish between the following two cases:
$\YES$ instances, in which for any assignment to the universal variables there
exists an assignment to the existential variables that satisfies all the
clauses, and $\NO$ instances in which there exists an assignment to the
universal variables such that any assignment to the existential variables
satisfies at most a $1-\eps$ fraction of the clauses. We also generalize this
result to any level of the polynomial-time hierarchy.

kagome lattice material Ho3Mg2Sb3O14 unites an ice-like magnetic degeneracy
with quantum-tunneling terms generated by an intrinsic splitting of the Ho3+
ground-state doublet, realizing a frustrated transverse Ising model. Using
neutron scattering and thermodynamic experiments, we observe a
symmetry-breaking transition at T*~0.32 K to a remarkable quantum state with
three peculiarities: a continuous magnetic excitation spectrum down to T~0.12K;
a macroscopic degeneracy of ice-like states; and a fragmentation of the spin
into periodic and aperiodic components strongly affected by quantum
fluctuations. Our results establish that Ho3Mg2Sb3O14 realizes a
spin-fragmented state on the kagome lattice, with intrinsic quantum dynamics
generated by a homogeneous transverse field.

signals of hundreds $\mu V$, hence the front-end electronics is an important
and delicate part of the detector in order to get a detectable signal. The
electronic chain is made up of an amplifier, a discriminator, a TDC. The new
front-end is realized with the use of silicon-germanium (SiGe) components,
provided by IHP microelectronics. With this technology we can implement BJT and
CMOS transistors on the same chip. The benefit of this improvement is to
minimize: power consumption of the channels ($2 \div 3$ $ \frac{mW}{ch}$),
noise (500 $e^-$ r.m.s), radiation hardness (10 kGy,$10^3$ $\frac{n}{cm}$) and
it maximizes the speed of response electronics. In this work I will highlight
the first TDC prototypes' results. The TDC uses a local oscillator, that has an
oscillation range between $0.6 \div 3 $ GHz, and a the temporal jitter of 15
ps. The data output from the TDC are presented in binary in order to lighten
data processing to the acquisition system. Moreover, we are studying a way to
minimize system latency. This optimization involves the addition of a
serializer (PISO) that sends the TDC data output to the acquisition system at 2
GHz.

fermionic but abelian, our results reproduce those available in the literature.
We discuss also continuous deformations of the T-dual models, obtained by
adding a closed B-field before the dualization. This idea can also be used to
generate deformations of the original (un-dualized) model, when the 2-cocycle
identified from the closed B is invertible. The latter construction is the
natural generalization of the so-called Yang-Baxter deformations, based on
solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation on the Lie algebra of G and
originally constructed for group manifolds and (super)coset sigma models. We
find that the deformed metric and B-field are obtained through a generalization
of the Seiberg-Witten map. When applied to integrable sigma models these
deformations preserve the integrability.

hydrostatic equilibrium along the vertical direction, the value of the Mach
number at the critical points deviates from unity, resulting in the
non-isomorphism of the critical and the sonic points. This introduces several
undesirable complexities while analytically dealing with the stationary
integral accretion solutions and the corresponding phase portraits. We propose
that introduction of an effective dynamical sound speed may resolve the issue
in an elegant way. We linear perturb the full spacetime-dependent general
relativistic Euler and the continuity equations governing the structure and the
dynamics of accretion disc in vertical equilibrium around Schwarzschild black
holes and identify the sonic metric embedded within the stationary background
flow. Such metric describes the propagation of the linear acoustic perturbation
inside the accretion flow. We construct the wave equation corresponding to that
acoustic perturbation and find the speed of propagation of such perturbation.
We finally show that the ordinary thermodynamic sound speed should be
substituted by the speed of propagation of the linear acoustic wave which has
been obtained through the dynamical perturbation. Such substitution will make
the value of Mach number at the critical point to be equal to unity. Use of the
aforementioned effective sound speed will lead to a modified stationary disc
structure where the critical and the sonic points will be identical.

a multiphase medium. The neutral hydrogen gas is bistable with a cold and warm
neutral medium (CNM and WNM respectively) but there is evidence for an
additional phase at intermediate temperatures, a lukewarm neutral medium (LNM)
that is thermally unstable. Aims. We use all sky data from the HI4PI survey to
separate these neutral HI phases with the aim to determine their distribution
and phase fractions in the local interstellar medium. Methods. HI4PI
observations, gridded on an nside = 1024 HEALPix grid, were decomposed into
Gaussian components. From the frequency distribution of the velocity
dispersions we infer three separate linewidth regimes. Accordingly we extract
the HI line emission corresponding to the CNM, LNM, and WNM. We generated
all-sky maps of these phases in the local HI gas with -8 < v_LSR < 8 km/s.
Results. Each of the HI phases shows distinct structures on all scales. The LNM
never exists as a single phase but contributes on average 41% of the HI. The
CNM is prominent only for 22% of the sky, contributes there on average 34% but
locally up to 60% of the HI and is associated with dust at temperatures T_dust
~ 18.6 K. Embedded cold filaments show a clear anti-correlation between CNM and
LNM. Also the smoothly distributed WNM is anti-correlated with the CNM. It
contributes for the rest of the sky 39% with dust associated at temperatures
T_dust ~ 19.4 K. Conclusions. The CNM in filaments exists on small scales. Here
the observed anti-correlation between LNM and CNM implies that both, filaments
and the surrounding more extended LNM, must have a common origin.

framework of the modified $f(R, T)$ theory of gravitation. The equation of
pressure isotropy of the standard Einstein theory is preserved however, the
energy density and pressure are expressed in terms of both gravitational
potentials. Invoking the isothermal prescription requires that the isotropy
condition assumes the role of a consistency condition and an exact model
generalizing that of general relativity is found. Moreover it is found that the
Einstein model is unstable and acausal while the $f(R, T)$ counterpart is well
behaved on account of the freedom available through an additional coupling
constant. The case of a constant spatial gravitational potential is considered
and the complete model is determined. This model is markedly different from its
Einstein counterpart which is known to be isothermal. Dropping the restriction
on the density and imposing a linear barotropic equation of state generates an
exact solution and consequently a stellar distribution as the vanishing of the
pressure is possible and a boundary hypersurface exists. Finally we comment on
the case of relaxing the equation of state but demanding an inverse square
fall-off of the density - this case proves intractable.

perform a 2-dimensional radiative transfer simulation for a kilonova/macronova

Swift on 2009 July 26 and 2013 March 1. We found the presence of a strong soft
X-ray excess emission, a broad but weak Fe line and hard X-ray excess emission.
We used the blurred reflection (relxill) and the intrinsic disc Comptonization
(optxagnf), two physically motivated models, to describe the broadband spectra
and to disentangle the disk/corona and jet emission. The relxill model is
mainly constrained by the strong soft X-ray excess although the model failed to
predict this excess when fitted above 3keV and extrapolated to lower energies.
The joint spectral analysis of the three datasets above 3keV with this model
resulted in a high black hole spin ($a>0.9$) and moderate reflection fraction
$R\sim 0.5$. The optxagnf model fitted to the two simultaneous datasets
resulted in an excess emission in the UV band. The simultaneous UV-to-hard
X-ray spectra of 1H~0323+342 are best described by a model consisting of a
primary X-ray power-law continuum with $\Gamma \sim 1.8$, a blurred reflection
component with $R\sim 0.5$, Comptonised disk emission as the soft X-ray excess,
optical/UV emission from a standard accretion disk around a black hole of mass

constructions that assign to it the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$ and the
Poisson-Lie dual group $G^*$. The main result of this paper is the following
relation between these two objects: the integral cone defined by the cluster
structure and the Berenstein-Kazhdan potential on the double Bruhat cell
$G^{\vee; w_0, e} \subset G^\vee$ is isomorphic to the integral Bohr-Sommerfeld
cone defined by the Poisson structure on the partial tropicalization of $K^*
\subset G^*$ (the Poisson-Lie dual of the compact form $K \subset G$). By [5],
the first cone parametrizes the canonical bases of irreducible $G$-modules. The
corresponding points in the second cone belong to integral symplectic leaves of
the partial tropicalization labeled by the highest weight of the
representation. As a by-product of our construction, we show that symplectic
volumes of generic symplectic leaves in the partial tropicalization of $K^*$
are equal to symplectic volumes of the corresponding coadjoint orbits in
$\operatorname{Lie}(K)^*$.
  To achieve these goals, we make use of (Langlands dual) double cluster
varieties defined by Fock and Goncharov [9]. These are pairs of cluster
varieties whose seed matrices are transpose to each other. There is a naturally
defined isomorphism between their tropicalizations. The isomorphism between the
cones described above is a particular instance of such an isomorphism
associated to the double Bruhat cells $G^{w_0, e} \subset G$ and $G^{\vee; w_0,
e} \subset G^\vee$.

scaling dimension exhibits a critical behaviour when the coupling constant
approaches Zamolodchikov's critical coupling. Analysis close to that point
suggests that the continuum limit of the fishnet graphs is controlled by the
two-dimensional $AdS_{5}$ non-linear sigma model. More generally, we present
evidence that the fishnet diagrams define an integrable lattice regularization
of the $AdS_{5}$ model. A system of massless TBA equations is derived for the
tachyon energy by dualizing the TBA equations of the weakly coupled planar
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory.

zero scattering cross section for weakly perturbing external probes, like
neutrons, etc., thus representing a 'hidden order'. Hence, the two competing

at systematically higher A(Li) than the mean cluster relation. This subset
exhibits higher V_ROT than the more Li-depleted sample and, from photometric
rotation periods, is dominated by stars classed as convective (C); all others
are interface (I) stars. The cool, high-Li rapid rotators are consistent with
models that consider simultaneously rapid rotation and radius inflation; rapid
rotators hotter than the sun exhibit excess Li depletion, as predicted by the

the Hyades/Praesepe and the Pleiades, is consistent with gyrochronological
analysis placing M35's age between the older M34 and younger Pleiades. However,
the Pleiades display a more excessive range in A(Li) and rotation period than
M35 on the low-Li, slow-rotation side of the distribution, with supposedly
younger stars at a given T_eff in the Pleiades spinning slower, with A(Li)
reduced by more than a factor of four compared to M35.

observed in an ""intermediate"" or ""very high"" state, with important
contributions from both an accretion disk and hard X-ray corona. The 2.3-10 keV
spectrum shows clear hallmarks of relativistic disk reflection. Fits with a
suitable model strongly indicate a near-maximal spin parameter of a = cJ/GM^2 =
0.994(2) and a disk that extends close to the innermost stable circular orbit,
r/r_ISCO = 1.08(8) (1-sigma statistical errors). In addition to the
relativistic spectrum from the innermost disk, a relatively narrow Fe K
emission line is also required. The resolution of NICER reveals that the narrow
line may be asymmetric, indicating a specific range of emission radii. Fits
with a relativistic line model suggest an inner radius of r = 144 (+140,-60)
GM/c^2 for the putative second reflection geometry; full reflection models
suggest that radii a few times larger are possible. The origin of the narrow
line is uncertain but a warp likely provides the most physically plausible
explanation. We discuss our results in terms of the potential for NICER to

the brain estimates a scalar decision variable corresponding to the
log-likelihood ratio of the two alternatives. Typical neural implementations of
this algorithmic cognitive model assume that large numbers of neurons are each
noisy exemplars of the scalar decision variable. Here we propose a neural
implementation of the diffusion model in which many neurons construct and
maintain the Laplace transform of the distance to each of the decision bounds.
As in classic findings from brain regions including LIP, the firing rate of
neurons coding for the Laplace transform of net accumulated evidence grows to a
bound during random dot motion tasks. However, rather than noisy exemplars of a
single mean value, this approach makes the novel prediction that firing rates
grow to the bound exponentially, across neurons there should be a distribution
of different rates. A second set of neurons records an approximate inversion of
the Laplace transform, these neurons directly estimate net accumulated
evidence. In analogy to time cells and place cells observed in the hippocampus
and other brain regions, the neurons in this second set have receptive fields
along a ""decision axis."" This finding is consistent with recent findings from
rodent recordings. This theoretical approach places simple evidence
accumulation models in the same mathematical language as recent proposals for
representing time and space in cognitive models for memory.

to a proper(comoving) scale of 168 (502) kpc at z = 2. The effect is observed
only for quiescent galaxies around other quiescent galaxies; the probability to
find star-forming galaxies around quiescent or around star-forming ones is
consistent with the clustering strength of galaxies of the same mass and at the
same redshift, as observed in dedicated studies of galaxy clustering. The
effect is mass dependent in the sense that the quenching probability is
stronger for galaxies of smaller mass ($\rm{M_*<10^{10} Msun}$) than for more
massive ones, i.e. it follows the opposite trend with mass relative to
gravitational galaxy clustering. The spatial scale where the effect is observed
suggests these environments are massive halos, in which case the observed
effect would likely be satellite quenching. The effect is also redshift
dependent in that the clustering strength of quiescent galaxies around other
quiescent galaxies at z = 1.6 is ~ 1.7 times larger than that of the galaxies

deviations significance, showing a remarkably stable flux and spectrum in VHE
$\gamma$-rays. Multi-frequency very-long-baseline array (VLBA) observations of
the source confirm the extended, jet-like structure previously found in the 1.6
GHz band with European VLBI Network and detect this component in the 4.6 GHz
and the 7.3 GHz bands. The radio spectral indices of the core and the jet and
the level of polarization derived from the VLBA observations are in a range
typical for blazars. Data from VERITAS, $Fermi$-LAT, $Swift$-XRT, FLWO 48$''$
telescope, and archival infrared and hard X-ray observations are used to
construct and model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with a
synchrotron-self-Compton model. The well-measured $\gamma$-ray peak of the SED
with VERITAS and $Fermi$-LAT provides constraining upper limits on the source
redshift. Possible contribution of secondary $\gamma$-rays from
ultra-high-energy cosmic ray-initiated electromagnetic cascades to the
$\gamma$-ray emission is explored, finding that only a segment of the VHE
spectrum can be accommodated with this process. A variability search is
performed across X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands. No statistically significant
flux or spectral variability is detected.

on the order of days, commonly occur in the Galaxy, including relatively
massive ($1.6-2.4$ $M_\odot$, i.e., A-type main sequence stars) and evolved
stars. The majority of A-type main sequence stars have stellar binary
companions, which can strongly affect the dynamical evolution of planets around
either star. In this work, we investigate the effects of gravitational
perturbations by a far away stellar companion on the orbital evolution of gas
giant planets orbiting A-type stars, the so-called Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL)
mechanism, including the effects of general relativity, post-main sequence
stellar evolution, and tides. We find that only $0.15~\%$ of A-type stars will
host HJs during their main sequence lifetime. However, we also find a new class
of planets, Temporary Hot Jupiters (THJs), that form during the post-main
sequence lifetime of about $3.7~\%$ of former A-type main sequence stars. These
THJs orbit on periods of tens to a hundred days and only exist for a few
$100{,}000$ years before they are engulfed, but they reach similar temperatures
as `classical' HJs due to the increased stellar luminosities. THJs' spin-orbit
angles will mostly be misaligned. THJ effects on the host stars' evolution
could also be observable for longer than a few $100{,}000$ years. Overall, we
find that approximately $70~\%$ of all gas giant planets orbiting A-type stars
will eventually be destroyed or engulfed by their star, about $25~\%$ during
the main sequence lifetime, about $45~\%$ during post-main sequence evolution.

(OTOC) signals scrambling, the spread of information through many-body

quasiprobability (a nonclassical generalization of a probability, which
coarse-grains to the OTOC) governs terms in the uncertainty bound. The
quasiprobability causes scrambling to strengthen the bound in numerical

interactions when the separations between the stars are short. While tidal
phenomena have been extensively studied, a certain tidal effect exclusive to
hierarchical triples (triples in which one component star has a much wider
orbit than the others) has hardly received any attention, mainly due to its
complexity and consequent resistance to being modelled. This tidal effect is
the tidal perturbation of the tertiary by the inner binary, which in turn
depletes orbital energy from the inner binary, causing the inner binary
separation to shrink. In this paper, we develop a fully numerical simulation of
these ""tertiary tides"" by modifying established tidal models. We also provide
general insight as to how close a hierarchical triple needs to be in order for
such an effect to take place, and demonstrate that our simulations can
effectively retrieve the orbital evolution for such systems. We conclude that
tertiary tides are a significant factor in the evolution of close hierarchical
triples, and strongly influence at least ~ 1% of all multiple star systems.

$\gamma$-ray regime, show similar morphological structures. This mutual
information reflects the imprint of the various physical components of the
interstellar medium. We want to use multifrequency all-sky observations to test
resolution improvement and restoration of unobserved areas for maps in certain
frequency ranges. For this we aim to reconstruct or predict from sets of other
maps all-sky maps that, in their original form, lack a high resolution compared
to other available all-sky surveys or are incomplete in their spatial coverage.
Additionally, we want to investigate the commonalities and differences that the
ISM components exhibit over the electromagnetic spectrum. We build an
$n$-dimensional representation of the joint pixel-brightness distribution of
$n$ maps using a Gaussian mixture model and see how predictive it is: How well
can one map be reproduced based on subsets of other maps? Tests with mock data
show that reconstructing the map of a certain frequency from other frequency
regimes works astonishingly well, predicting reliably small-scale details well
below the spatial resolution of the initially learned map. Applied to the
observed multifrequency data sets of the Milky Way this technique is able to
improve the resolution of, e.g., the low-resolution Fermi LAT maps as well as
to recover the sky from artifact-contaminated data like the ROSAT 0.855 keV
map. The predicted maps generally show less imaging artifacts compared to the
original ones. A comparison of predicted and original maps highlights
surprising structures, imaging artifacts (fortunately not reproduced in the
prediction), and features genuine to the respective frequency range that are
not present at other frequency bands. We discuss limitations of this machine
learning approach and ideas how to overcome them.

provides a pathway for enabling the intriguing physics of nanomagnetism and
developing broad spintronics applications. After decades of searches for
promising materials, the energy scale of PMA of transition metal thin films,
unfortunately, remains only about 1 meV. This limitation has become a major
bottleneck in the development of ultradense storage and memory devices. We
discovered unprecedented PMA in Fe thin-film growth on the $(000\bar{1})$
N-terminated surface of III-V nitrides from first-principles calculations. PMA
ranges from 24.1 meV/u.c. in Fe/BN to 53.7 meV/u.c. in Fe/InN.
Symmetry-protected degeneracy between $x^2-y^2$ and $xy$ orbitals and its lift
by the spin-orbit coupling play a dominant role. As a consequence, PMA in
Fe/III-V nitride thin films is dominated by first-order perturbation of the
spin-orbit coupling, instead of second-order in conventional transition
metal/oxide thin films. This game-changing scenario would also open a new field
of magnetism on transition metal/nitride interfaces.

by tidally-induced fluid motion during binary neutron star inspiral. Fluid
compression is computed for low radial order oscillation modes through an
adiabatic, time-dependent solution of the mode amplitudes. Optically thin
neutrino emission and heating rates are then computed from this adiabatic fluid
motion. Calculations use direct and modified Urca reactions operating in a
$M=1.4\, M_\odot$ neutron star, which is constructed using the Skyrme Rs
equation of state. We find that the energy pumped into low order oscillation
modes is not efficiently thermalized even by direct Urca reactions, with core
temperatures reaching only $T \simeq 10^8\, {\rm K}$ during the inspiral.
Although this is an order of magnitude larger than the heating due to shear
viscosity considered by previous studies, it reinforces the result that the
stars are quite cold at merger. Upon excitation of the lowest order g-mode, the
chemical potential imbalance reaches $\beta > 1\, {\rm MeV}$ at orbital
frequencies $\nu_{\rm orb} > 200\, {\rm Hz}$, implying significant
charged-current optical depths and Fermi blocking. To asses the importance of
neutrino degeneracy effects, the neutrino transfer equation is solved in the
static approximation for the three-dimensional density distribution, and the
reaction rates are then computed including Fermi-blocking. We find that the
heating rate is suppressed by factors of a few for $\nu_{\rm orb} > 200\, {\rm

transfer effects, is presented for a range of orbital separations.

relationships between a set of agents; however, little focus has been given to
the considerations of how to represent observed phenomena as a network object.
In the case of physical structures such as electric grids or transportation
flows, the construction of a network model is fairly straightforward as the
nodes and edges usually correspond to some physical structure themselves. On
the other hand, construction of a social network is much less defined; while
nodes may correspond to well defined social agents, such as people or groups of
people, there much more liberty in defining the relationship that edges should
represent. This paper studies the intricacies of constructing a social network
from data, in particular, binary data, applicable to a wide range of social
science contexts. We examine several methods of constructing social networks in
prior literature and discuss the methods under a common framework. Finally,
using a data set of meetings among technologists in New York, we show that the
different constructions of social networks arising from various interpretations
of the underlying social relationships can result in vastly different network
structures. These findings highlight the significance of understanding the
precise relationships of interest when building a network model.

Despite large amounts of video data, this remains a challenging task because of

the Decompositional Disentangled Predictive Auto-Encoder (DDPAE), a framework
that combines structured probabilistic models and deep networks to
automatically (i) decompose the high-dimensional video that we aim to predict
into components, and (ii) disentangle each component to have low-dimensional
temporal dynamics that are easier to predict. Crucially, with an appropriately
specified generative model of video frames, our DDPAE is able to learn both the
latent decomposition and disentanglement without explicit supervision. For the
Moving MNIST dataset, we show that DDPAE is able to recover the underlying
components (individual digits) and disentanglement (appearance and location) as
we would intuitively do. We further demonstrate that DDPAE can be applied to
the Bouncing Balls dataset involving complex interactions between multiple
objects to predict the video frame directly from the pixels and recover
physical states without explicit supervision.

behaviours: one in which one elephant follows the other, and another in which
they go in opposite directions. With the aid of a Fokker-Planck equation, the
second moment is evaluated and two new super-diffusion regimes appear, not
found in other ERWs. Then, I re-interpret the equations as a bidimensional

To achieve this goal we have developed Simflowny, an open platform for
scientific dynamical models which automatically generates parallel code for
different simulation frameworks, allowing the use of HPC infrastructures to
non-specialist scientists. One of these frameworks is SAMRAI, a mature
patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement infrastructure, capable of
reaching exascale in some specific problems. Here we present the numerical
techniques that we have implemented on this framework by using Simflowny in
order to perform fast, efficient, accurate and highly-scalable simulations.
These techniques involve high-order schemes for smooth and non-smooth
solutions, Adaptive Mesh Refinement with arbitrary resolution ratios and an
optimal strategy for the sub-cycling in time. We validate the automatically
generated codes for the SAMRAI infrastructure with some simple test examples
(i.e., wave equation and Newtonian MHD) and finally with the Einstein
equations.

connecting two gapless phases with nodal lines takes place at a critical
magnetic field hc1 in this regime. While the nodal lines at hc1 is protected by
the mirror symmetry with Jx = Jy and disappear at Jx 6= Jy with a gap opening
near the critical field, the nodal points at E = 0 can exist at intermediate

Hamiltonian, which results in the robust intermediate gapless phase for AFM
KSL. For FM KSL, there is no intermediate PT before polarization. The above

techniques, (light-induced) triplet-nitroxide DEER (LiDEER) and laser-induced
magnetic dipole spectroscopy (LaserIMD). In this work, we set out to
quantitatively compare the two techniques under equivalent conditions at Q

the high modulation depth that can be achieved with LaserIMD, we further
explore the possibility of improving the LiDEER experiment with chirp inversion
pulses. LiDEER employing a broadband pump pulse results in a drastic
improvement of the modulation depth. The relative performance of chirp LiDEER
and Laser-IMD in terms of modulation-to-noise ratio is found to depend on the
dipolar evolution time: While LaserIMD yields higher modulation-to-noise ratios
than LiDEER at short dipolar evolution times ({\tau}=2 {\mu}s), the high phase
memory time of the triplet spins causes the situation to revert at {\tau}=6
{\mu}s.

one can solve the Stokes equations by using an appropriate distribution of flow
singularities of the right strength within the boundary, a method particularly
useful to describe the dynamics of long slender objects for which the numerical
implementation of the BI representation becomes cumbersome. While the BI
approach is a mathematical consequence of the Stokes equations, the singularity
method involves making judicious guesses that can only be justified a
posteriori. In this paper we use matched asymptotic expansions to derive an
algebraically accurate slender-body theory directly from the BI representation
able to handle arbitrary surface velocities and surface tractions. This
expansion procedure leads to sets of uncoupled linear equations and to a single
one-dimensional integral equation identical to that derived by Keller and
Rubinow (1976) and Johnson (1979) using the singularity method. Hence we show
that it is a mathematical consequence of the BI approach that the leading-order
flow around a slender body can be represented using a distribution of
singularities along its centreline. Furthermore when derived from either the
single-layer or double-layer modified BI representation, general slender
solutions are only possible in certain types of flow, in accordance with the
limitations of these representations.

well as the interference, and by calculating the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage. Nonetheless, the
correctness of the existing coverage expressions derived through stochastic

of the detailed mmWave channel and antenna features. In this study, we propose
an SINR coverage analysis framework that includes realistic channel model (from
NYU) and antenna element radiation patterns (with isotropic/directional
radiation). We first introduce two parameters, aligned gain and misaligned
gain, associated with the desired signal beam and the interfering signal beam,
respectively. We provide the distributions of the aligned and misaligned gains
through curve fitting of system-simulation results. The distribution of these
gains is used to determine the distribution of the SINR. We compare the
obtained analytical SINR coverage with the corresponding SINR coverage
calculated via system-level simulations. The results show that both aligned and
misaligned gains can be modeled as exponential-logarithmically distributed
random variables with the highest accuracy, and can further be approximated as
exponentially distributed random variables with reasonable accuracy. These
approximations are thus expected to be useful to evaluate the system
performance under ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) and
evolved mobile broadband (eMBB) scenarios, respectively.

treatment and other covariates that do have scientific importance are given the

regression. This is useful in situations where a subset of the variables are of

  via LP Relaxations",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider clustering in the perturbation resilience model that has been
studied since the work of Bilu and Linial [ICS, 2010] and Awasthi, Blum and
Sheffet [Inf. Proc. Lett., 2012]. A clustering instance $I$ is said to be
$\alpha$-perturbation resilient if the optimal solution does not change when
the pairwise distances are modified by a factor of $\alpha$ and the perturbed
distances satisfy the metric property --- this is the metric perturbation
resilience property introduced in Angelidakis et. al. [STOC, 2010] and a weaker
requirement than prior models. We make two high-level contributions.
  1) We show that the natural LP relaxation of $k$-center and asymmetric
$k$-center is integral for $2$-perturbation resilient instances. We belive that
demonstrating the goodness of standard LP relaxations complements existing
results that are based on combinatorial algorithms designed for the
perturbation model.
  2) We define a simple new model of perturbation resilience for clustering
with \emph{outliers}. Using this model we show that the unified MST and dynamic
programming based algorithm proposed by Angelidakis et. al. [STOC, 2010]
exactly solves the clustering with outliers problem for several common center
based objectives (like $k$-center, $k$-means, $k$-median) when the instances is
$2$-perturbation resilient. We further show that a natural LP relxation is
integral for $2$-perturbation resilient instances of \kcenter with outliers.

important for several reasons, including: detecting fast-moving near-Earth
asteroids; detecting or flagging faint satellites streaks; and flagging or
removing diffraction spikes, pixel bleeding, line-like cosmic rays and
bad-pixel features. Here we discuss an efficient and optimal algorithm for the
detection of such streaks. The optimal method to detect streaks in astronomical
images is by cross-correlating the image with a template of a line broadened by
the point spread function of the system. To do so efficiently, the
cross-correlation of the streak position and angle is performed using the Radon
transform, which is the integral of pixel values along all possible lines
through an image. A fast version of the Radon transform exists, which we here
extend to efficiently detect arbitrarily short lines. While the brute force
Radon transform requires an order of N^3 operations for an N by N image, the
fast Radon transform has a complexity of the order of N^2 log(N). We apply this
method to simulated images, recovering the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio,
and to real images, finding long streaks of low-Earth-orbit satellites and
shorter streaks of Global Positioning System satellites. We detect streaks that
are barely visible to the eye, out of hundreds of images, without a-priori
knowledge of the streaks' positions or angles. We provide implementation of
this algorithm in Python and MATLAB.

  Sensitivity to Parameter Values","Technical report",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local explanation methods, also known as attribution methods, attribute a
deep network's prediction to its input (cf. Baehrens et al. (2010)). We respond
to the claim from Adebayo et al. (2018) that local explanation methods lack
sensitivity, i.e., DNNs with randomly-initialized weights produce explanations
that are both visually and quantitatively similar to those produced by DNNs
with learned weights.
  Further investigation reveals that their findings are due to two choices in
their analysis: (a) ignoring the signs of the attributions; and (b) for
integrated gradients (IG), including pixels in their analysis that have zero
attributions by choice of the baseline (an auxiliary input relative to which
the attributions are computed). When both factors are accounted for, IG
attributions for a random network and the actual network are uncorrelated. Our
investigation also sheds light on how these issues affect visualizations,
although we note that more work is needed to understand how viewers interpret
the difference between the random and the actual attributions.

covariate-adaptive randomization when there are multiple treatments. More
specifically, we study inference about the average effect of one or more
treatments relative to other treatments or a control. As in Bugni et al.
(2018), covariate-adaptive randomization refers to randomization schemes that
first stratify according to baseline covariates and then assign treatment
status so as to achieve balance within each stratum. In contrast to Bugni et
al. (2018), we not only allow for multiple treatments, but further allow for
the proportion of units being assigned to each of the treatments to vary across
strata. We first study the properties of estimators derived from a fully
saturated linear regression, i.e., a linear regression of the outcome on all
interactions between indicators for each of the treatments and indicators for
each of the strata. We show that tests based on these estimators using the
usual heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance are
invalid; on the other hand, tests based on these estimators and suitable
estimators of the asymptotic variance that we provide are exact. For the
special case in which the target proportion of units being assigned to each of
the treatments does not vary across strata, we additionally consider tests
based on estimators derived from a linear regression with strata fixed effects,
i.e., a linear regression of the outcome on indicators for each of the

low-positional-resolution observations of faint sources remain feasible. We can
record unsaturated images of bright ($J=3.9$) sources due to the large pixel
well-depth and resulting high dynamic range. When mounted on an 18-inch
telescope, the sensor is capable of achieving milli-magnitude precision for
sources brighter than $J=8$. Faint sources can be sky-background-limited with
modest thermoelectric cooling. We can detect faint sources ($J=16.4$ at

laboratory testing, we characterize the noise properties, sensitivity, and

well to novel environments given a dataset of example environments. The key
technical idea behind our approach is to leverage tools from generalization
theory in machine learning by exploiting a precise analogy (which we present in
the form of a reduction) between generalization of control policies to novel
environments and generalization of hypotheses in the supervised learning
setting. In particular, we utilize the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC)-Bayes framework, which allows us to obtain upper bounds that hold with
high probability on the expected cost of (stochastic) control policies across
novel environments. We propose policy learning algorithms that explicitly seek
to minimize this upper bound. The corresponding optimization problem can be
solved using convex optimization (Relative Entropy Programming in particular)
in the setting where we are optimizing over a finite policy space. In the more
general setting of continuously parameterized policies (e.g., neural network
policies), we minimize this upper bound using stochastic gradient descent. We
present simulated results of our approach applied to learning (1) reactive
obstacle avoidance policies and (2) neural network-based grasping policies. We
also present hardware results for the Parrot Swing drone navigating through
different obstacle environments. Our examples demonstrate the potential of our
approach to provide strong generalization guarantees for robotic systems with
continuous state and action spaces, complicated (e.g., nonlinear) dynamics,
rich sensory inputs (e.g., depth images), and neural network-based policies.

requires expensive content extraction methods. Modern extraction techniques are
based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can classify objects
within images with astounding accuracy. Unfortunately, these methods are slow:
processing a single image can take about 10 milliseconds on modern GPU-based
hardware. As massive video libraries become ubiquitous, running a content-based
query over millions of video frames is prohibitive.
  One promising approach to reduce the runtime cost of queries of visual
content is to use a hierarchical model, such as a cascade, where simple cases
are handled by an inexpensive classifier. Prior work has sought to design
cascades that optimize the computational cost of inference by, for example,
using smaller CNNs. However, we observe that there are critical factors besides
the inference time that dramatically impact the overall query time. Notably, by
treating the physical representation of the input image as part of our query
optimization---that is, by including image transforms, such as resolution
scaling or color-depth reduction, within the cascade---we can optimize data
handling costs and enable drastically more efficient classifier cascades.
  In this paper, we propose Tahoma, which generates and evaluates many
potential classifier cascades that jointly optimize the CNN architecture and
input data representation. Our experiments on a subset of ImageNet show that
Tahoma's input transformations speed up cascades by up to 35 times. We also
find up to a 98x speedup over the ResNet50 classifier with no loss in accuracy,
and a 280x speedup if some accuracy is sacrificed.

surveys is that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of galaxies traced by

already in place at z~2, but they are dynamically hotter than spiral galaxies
in the local Universe. Although several plausible mechanisms for this elevated
velocity dispersion (e.g. star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or more
frequent galaxy interactions) have been proposed, the fundamental driver of the
velocity dispersion enhancement at high redshift remains unclear. We
investigate the origin of this kinematic evolution using a suite of
cosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)
project. Although IFS surveys generally cover a wider range of stellar masses
than in these simulations, the simulated galaxies show trends between intrinsic
velocity dispersion, SFR, and redshift in agreement with observations. In both
the observed and simulated galaxies, intrinsic velocity dispersion is
positively correlated with SFR. Intrinsic velocity dispersion increases with
redshift out to z~1 and then flattens beyond that. In the FIRE simulations,
intrinsic velocity dispersion can vary significantly on timescales of <100 Myr.
These variations closely mirror the time evolution of the SFR and gas inflow
rate. By cross-correlating pairs of intrinsic velocity dispersion, gas inflow
rate, and SFR, we show that increased gas inflow leads to subsequent enhanced
star formation, and enhancements in intrinsic velocity dispersion tend to
temporally coincide with increases in gas inflow rate and SFR.

prediction time of a trained black-box structured classifier without losing
accuracy. To do so, we train a speedup classifier that learns to mimic a
black-box classifier under the learning-to-search approach. As the structured
classifier predicts more examples, the speedup classifier will operate as a
learned heuristic to guide search to favorable regions of the output space. We
present a mistake bound for the speedup classifier and identify inference
situations where it can independently make correct judgments without input
features. We evaluate our method on the task of entity and relation extraction
and show that the speedup classifier outperforms even greedy search in terms of
speed without loss of accuracy.

for photovoltaics applications where there is a growing interest. Still,
questions arise when looking at the unusual long carrier lifetime that,
regarding the micrometric diffusion length, would imply a very low diffusion
coefficient as compared to commonly used photovoltaic absorbers. In this paper,
we provide an experimental insight into this long lifetime of charge carriers
in slow-motion. Our approach relies on an improved model to analyze
time-resolved photoluminescence decays at multiple fluence levels that includes
charge carrier transport, photon recycling, and traps dynamics. The model is
verified on different interface properties. Moreover, we investigate various
perovskite absorbers such as mixed alloys with cesium content. For most of the
perovskite based materials we analyzed, the band-to-band recombination rate
remains close to the radiative limit, leading to the expected sub-microsecond
lifetime. The slow diffusion of charge carriers is observed with values of the
diffusion coefficient D around 5x10-3 cm2/s. Nonetheless, the power conversion
efficiency remains high. The observations might be related to the debated
coexistence of a direct and indirect bandgap slowing down the recombination
process.

observational research. OR reflects statistical association between a binary

estimation for OR are often performed on the logarithmic scale, due to
asymptotic convergence of log(OR) to a normal distribution. Here, we propose a

normalization constant for $\gamma'$ is based on the maximum range of the
standardized effect size, for which we establish a peculiar connection to the
Laplace Limit Constant. Furthermore, while standardized effects are of little

low-temperature, low-gravity photosphere with significant extinction and no
more than modest continuum veiling. Its $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \simeq 3260$ K
effective temperature is similar to that of older, more evolved
pre-main-sequence stars, but its surface gravity log $g \simeq 2.4$ cm s$^{-2}$

a factor of $\sim 3$ larger than that of $10^6$ yr old T Tauri stars. Its low
veiling is consistent with a circumstellar disk having intrinsic near-IR
emission that is less than or equal to that of more evolved Class I protostars.
Along with the high extinction, this suggests that most of the circumstellar
material is in a cold envelope, as expected for a Class 0 protostar. This is
the first known detection and analysis of a Class 0 protostar absorption

inspired by coherent control techniques in lossless driven qubits. We
demonstrate that there exist optimal phases for maximally robust excitation
exchange in lossy strongly-driven optomechanical state transfer. In addition,
our proposed composite phase driving also protects against random variations in
the parameters of the system. However, this driving can take the system out of
its steady state. For this reason, we use the ideal optimal phases to produce
smooth sequences that both maintain the system close to its steady state and
optimize the robustness of optomechanical state transfer.

prove $\beta\geq 2$ provided the space is doubling. We use the local exponent
$\beta$ in time-scale renormalization of discrete time random walks, that are
approximate at a given scale in the sense that the expected jump size is the
order of the space scale. In analogy with the variable Ahlfors regularity space
scaling condition involving $\alpha$, we consider the condition that the
expected time to leave a ball scales like the radius of the ball to the power
$\beta$ of the center. Under this local time scaling condition along with the
local space scaling condition of Ahlfors regularity, we then study the $\Gamma$

cell`s and the concentration of the growth factors they produce are the major
factors in determining the final morphology of the network.

large sparse linear systems. For SPD matrices, convergence of AMG is well
motivated in the $A$-norm, and AMG has proven to be an effective solver for
many applications. Recently, several AMG algorithms have been developed that
are effective on nonsymmetric linear systems. Although motivation was provided
in each case, the convergence of AMG for nonsymmetric linear systems is still
not well understood, and algorithms are based largely on heuristics or
incomplete theory.
  For multigrid restriction and interpolation operators, $R$ and $P$,
respectively, let $\Pi:= P(RAP)^{-1}RA$ denote the projection corresponding to
coarse-grid correction in AMG. It is invariably the case in the nonsymmetric
setting that $\|\Pi\| > 1$ in any known norm. This causes an interesting
dichotomy: coarse-grid correction is fundamental to AMG achieving fast
convergence, but, in this case, can actually increase the error. Here, we
present a detailed analysis of nonsymmetric AMG, discussing why SPD theory
breaks down in the nonsymmetric setting, and developing a general framework for
convergence of NS-AMG. Classical multigrid weak and strong approximation
properties are generalized to a \textit{fractional approximation property}.
Conditions are then developed on $R$ and $P$ to ensure that
$\|\Pi\|_{\sqrt{A^*A}}$ is nicely bounded, independent of problem size. This is
followed by the development of conditions for two-grid and multilevel W-cycle
convergence in the $\sqrt{A^*A}$-norm.

equal to the one predicted by the von K\'arm\'an law at the energy containing

as anticipated in theory~\citep{Yang2017PoP}. Further, in agreement with a

nearby galaxies, our goal is to demonstrate in NGC300 that integral field
spectroscopy with high spatial resolution and excellent seeing conditions
reaches an unprecedented depth in severely crowded fields.
  Methods. MUSE observations with seven pointings in NGC300 have resulted in
datacubes that are analyzed in four ways: (1) PSF-fitting 3D spectroscopy with
PampelMUSE yields deblended spectra of individually distinguishable stars. The
technique also provides samples of planetary nebulae that are complete down to
m5007=28. (2) pseudo-monochromatic images, created at the wavelengths of the
most important emission lines and corrected for continuum light by using the
P3D visualization tool, provide maps of HII regions, SNR, and the diffuse ISM
at a high level of sensitivity, allowing for the discovery of planetary
nebulae, WR stars etc. (3) The use of the P3D line-fitting tool yields emission
line fluxes, surface brightness, and kinematic information for gaseous objects,
corrected for absorption line profiles of the underlying stellar population.
(4) Visual inspection of the datacubes is demonstrated to be effcient for data
mining and the discovery of background galaxies and unusual objects.
  Results. We present a catalogue of luminous stars, rare stars such as WR and
other emission line stars, carbon stars, symbiotic star candidates, planetary
nebulae, HII regions, supernova remnants, giant shells, peculiar diffuse and
filamentary emission line objects, and background galaxies, along with their
spectra.
  Conclusions. The technique of crowded-field 3D spectroscopy is capable of
deblending individual bright stars, the unresolved background of faint stars,
gaseous nebulae, and the diffuse component of the interstellar medium,
resulting in unprecedented legacy value for observations of nearby galaxies
with MUSE.

  mixed isogeometric analysis","21 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We approximate the spectra of a class of $2n$-order differential operators
using isogeometric analysis in mixed formulations. This class includes a wide
range of differential operators such as those arising in elliptic, biharmonic,
Cahn-Hilliard, Swift-Hohenberg, and phase-field crystal equations. The spectra
of the differential operators are approximated by solving differential
eigenvalue problems in mixed formulations, which require auxiliary parameters.
The mixed isogeometric formulation when applying classical quadrature rules
leads to an eigenvalue error convergence of order $2p$ where $p$ is the order
of the underlying B-spline space. We improve this order to be $2p+2$ by
applying optimally-blended quadrature rules developed in \cite{20,52} and this
order is an optimum in the view of dispersion error. We also compare these
results with the mixed finite elements and show numerically that mixed
isogeometric analysis leads to significantly better spectral approximations.

phenomenon. Recent studies found that along a vehicle platoon described in the
Lagrangian specification, traffic oscillations grow in a concave way. Since
stationary bottlenecks are more intuitively described in the Eulerian
framework, this paper investigates whether the concave growth pattern of
traffic oscillations in the Lagrangian coordinates can be transferred to the
Euler coordinates (i.e. the concave increase in standard deviation is no longer
measured across the vehicle indices but as a function of the road location). To
this end, we theoretically unify these two ways of measuring oscillations by
revealing their mapping relationship. We show that the growth pattern measured
in the Lagrangian coordinates can be transferred to the Euler coordinates. We
believe this finding is nontrivial since the scenarios are significantly
different: while in vehicle platoons (Lagrangian view, non-penetrable moving
bottleneck), the speed variance for a given vehicle is ideally constant, the
drivers in the Eulerian setting (penetrable stationary bottleneck triggering
the waves) experience all amplitudes, first the big ones and then the small
ones. To test this proposition, we performed simulation using two different
kinds of car-following models. Simulation results validate the theoretical
analysis. Finally, we performed empirical analysis using the NGSIM data, which
also validates the theoretical analysis.

connections to several branches of mathematics. On the algebraic side, parking
functions can be identified with the standard monomials of $M_n$, a certain
monomial ideal in the polynomial ring $S = {\mathbb K}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ where
a set of generators are indexed by the nonempty subsets of $[n] =
\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Motivated by constructions from the theory of chip-firing on
graphs we study generalizations of parking functions determined by $M^{(k)}_n$,
a subideal of $M_n$ obtained by allowing only generators corresponding to
subsets of $[n]$ of size at most $k$. For each $k$ the set of standard
monomials of $M^{(k)}_n$, denoted $\text{stan}_n^k$, contains the usual parking
functions and has interesting combinatorial properties in its own right. For
general $k$ we show that elements of $\text{stan}_n^k$ can be recovered as
certain vector-parking functions, which in turn leads to a formula for their
count via results of Yan. The symmetric group $S_n$ naturally acts on the set
$\text{stan}_n^k$ and we also obtain a formula for the number of orbits under
this action. For the case of $k = n-2$ we study combinatorial interpretations
of $\text{stan}_n^{n-2}$ and relate them to properties of uprooted trees in
terms of root degree and surface inversions. As a corollary we obtain a
combinatorial identity for $n^n$ involving Catalan numbers, reminiscent of a
result of Benjamin and Juhnke. For the case of $k = 1$ we observe that the
number of elements $\text{stan}_n^1$ is given by the determinant of the reduced
`signless' Laplacian, which provides a weighted count for $|\text{stan}_n^1|$
in terms generalized spanning trees known as `spanning TU-subgraphs'. Our
constructions naturally generalize to arbitrary graphs and lead to a number of
open questions.

models based on a time-dependent implementation of the viscous decretion disc
(VDD) paradigm, in which a disc around a fast-spinning Be star is formed by
material ejected by the star and driven to progressively larger orbits by means
of viscous torques. Our simulations offer a good description of the photometric
variability during phases of disc formation and dissipation, which suggests
that the VDD model adequately describes the structural evolution of the disc.
Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to determine the viscosity parameter
{\alpha}, as well as the net mass and angular momentum (AM) loss rates. We find
that {\alpha} is variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, not only from cycle to
cycle but also within a given cycle. Additionally, build-up phases usually have
larger values of {\alpha} than the dissipation phases. Furthermore, during
dissipation the outward AM flux is not necessarily zero, meaning that {\omega}
CMa does not experience a true quiescence but, instead, switches between a high
to a low AM loss rate during which the disc quickly assumes an overall lower
density but never zero. We confront the average AM loss rate with predictions
from stellar evolution models for fast-rotating stars, and find that our
measurements are smaller by more than one order of magnitude.

propose a novel diverse online feature selection method based on Determinantal
Point Processes (DPP). Our model aims to provide diverse features which can be
composed in either a supervised or unsupervised framework. The framework aims
to promote diversity based on the kernel produced on a feature level, through
at most three stages: feature sampling, local criteria and global criteria for
feature selection. In the feature sampling, we sample incoming stream of
features using conditional DPP. The local criteria is used to assess and select
streamed features (i.e. only when they arrive), we use unsupervised scale
invariant methods to remove redundant features and optionally supervised
methods to introduce label information to assess relevant features. Lastly, the
global criteria uses regularization methods to select a global optimal subset
of features. This three stage procedure continues until there are no more
features arriving or some predefined stopping condition is met. We demonstrate
based on experiments conducted on that this approach yields better compactness,
is comparable and in some instances outperforms other state-of-the-art online
feature selection methods.

is distorted in accordance with the flow symmetry, whereas the form of the
interaction potential remains unchanged. The role of this mismatch in the
relaxation mechanism under the flow field is crucial for understanding the
shear-thinning mechanism and differs between strong and fragile glass formers.
In fragile glass formers, shear thinning can be attributed to the shear-induced
reduction of the {\it effective density}. In contrast, in strong glass formers,
the shear-induced reduction of the {\it effective activation energy} is a
possible origin of a significant acceleration in relaxation. Our simple
predictions of the crossover shear rate, $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$, from Newtonian
to non-Newtonian behaviors can be expressed in terms of experimental
observables: in fragile liquids, $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}=(\rho \partial
\tau_\alpha/\partial \rho)^{-1}$, where $\rho$ and $\tau_\alpha$ are the
density and structural relaxation time, respectively, and in strong liquids,
$\dot\gamma_{\rm c}= (\tau_\alpha\Delta E_0 /T)^{-1} $, where $T$ and $\Delta
E_0$ are the temperature and equilibrium activation energy, respectively. These
predictions are consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations
for four different glass formers: two fragile and two strong ones. This
different route to the non-Newtonian flow response is related to differences in
the role of density in the relaxation dynamics.

spectral resolution, starlight suppression, and exposure time for detecting
biosignature and habitability marker gases. The results are highly dependent on
cloud conditions. A low-cloud case is more favorable because of deeper and
denser lines whereas a no-cloud case is the pessimistic case for its low
albedo. The minimum exposure time for detecting a certain molecule species can
vary by a large factor ($\sim$10) between the low-cloud case and the no-cloud
case. For all cases, we provide baseline requirements for HabEx and LUVOIR. The
impact of exo-zodiacal contamination and thermal background is also discussed
and will be included in future studies.

Specifically, we put forward the Dense Feature Pyramid Network (DFPN), which is

Compared with previous multi-scale detectors such as Feature Pyramid Network
(FPN), DFPN builds the high-level semantic feature-maps for all scales by means
of dense connections, through which enhances the feature propagation and
encourages the feature reuse. Additionally, in the case of ship rotation and
dense arrangement, we design a rotation anchor strategy to predict the minimum
circumscribed rectangle of the object so as to reduce the redundant detection
region and improve the recall. Furthermore, we also propose multi-scale ROI
Align for the purpose of maintaining the completeness of semantic and spatial

the Peierls-distorted or reconstructed edge structure is stabilized by a

the spin textures of edge states in the Peierls-distorted Sb edge structure and
the shear-distorted Bi edge structure have all three spin components
perpendicular and parallel to the edges, due to their broken mirror-plane

reaction is generated towards negative PMI announcements, while a positive
reaction is generally generated for positive PMI news. We further find that the
positive reaction towards the positive PMI news occurs 1 day before the

in the context of expanding economic conditions. By contrast, the negative
reaction towards negative PMI news is prevalent during downward economic
conditions for stocks with low market value, low institutional shareholding

of galaxies, and identify nuclear starbursts using the fibre specific star
formation rates derived from the SDSS spectra. We find a statistically
significant correlation between bulge elongation and nuclear starbursts in the
sense that the fraction of nuclear starbursts increases with bulge elongation.
This correlation is more prominent for fainter and redder galaxies, which
exhibit higher ratios of elongated bulges. We find no significant environmental
dependence of the correlation between bulge elongation and nuclear starbursts.
These results suggest that non-axisymmetric bulges can efficiently feed the gas

multi-layer cuprates, a three-layer Hubbard model is studied with the
two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) approach so as to incorporate electron
correlations. The linearized Eliashberg equation is then solved for the gap
function in a matrix form to resolve the role of outer CuO$_2$ planes (OPs) and
inner plane (IP). We show that OPs dominate IP in the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave
superconductivity, while IP dominates in the antiferromagnetism. This comes
from an electron correlation effect in that the correlation makes the doping
rates different between OPs and IP (i.e., a self-doping effect), which occurs
in intermediate and strong correlation regimes. Namely, the antiferromagnetic
fluctuations in IP are stronger due to a stronger electron correlation, which
simultaneously reduces the quasiparticle density of states in IP with a
suppressed $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity. Intriguingly, while the
off-diagonal (inter-layer) elements in the gap function matrix are tiny, {\it
inter-layer pair scattering} processes are in fact at work in enhancing the
superconducting transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ through the inter-layer
Green's functions. This actually causes the trilayer system to have higher
$T_{\text{c}}$ than the single-layer in a weak- and intermediate-coupling
regimes. This picture holds for a range of the on-site Hubbard repulsion $U$
that contains those estimated for the cuprates. The present result is
qualitatively consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in
multi-layer cuprates superconductors.

often the only data accessible that record system events at runtime. In recent
years, because of the ever-increasing log size, data mining techniques are
often utilized to help developers and operators conduct system reliability
management. A typical log-based system reliability management procedure is to
first parse log messages because of their unstructured format; and apply data
mining techniques on the parsed logs to obtain critical system behavior
information. Most of existing research studies focus on offline log parsing,
which need to parse logs in batch mode. However, software systems, especially
distributed systems, require online monitoring and maintenance. Thus, a log
parser that can parse log messages in a streaming manner is highly in demand.
To address this problem, we propose an online log parsing method, namely Drain,
based on directed acyclic graph, which encodes specially designed rules for
parsing. Drain can automatically generate a directed acyclic graph for a new
system and update the graph according to the incoming log messages. Besides,
Drain frees developers from the burden of parameter tuning by allowing them use
Drain with no pre-defined parameters. To evaluate the performance of Drain, we
collect 11 log datasets generated by real-world systems, ranging from
distributed systems, Web applications, supercomputers, operating systems, to
standalone software. The experimental results show that Drain has the highest
accuracy on all 11 datasets. Moreover, Drain obtains 37.15\%$\sim$ 97.14\%
improvement in the running time over the state-of-the-art online parsers. We
also conduct a case study on a log-based anomaly detection task using Drain in
the parsing step, which determines its effectiveness in system reliability
management.

rapid deployments (e.g., in the cases of crowded hotspots, sporting events,
emergencies, natural disasters) in order to assist the ground BSs. In this
paper, an analytical framework is provided to analyze the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability of unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular networks with clustered user equipments
(UEs). Locations of UAVs and ground BSs are modeled as Poison point processes
(PPPs), and UEs are assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson cluster
process (PCP) around the projections of UAVs on the ground. Initially, the
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) and probability density
function (PDF) of path losses for both UAV and ground BS tiers are derived.
Subsequently, association probabilities with each tier are obtained. SINR
coverage probability is derived for the entire network using tools from
stochastic geometry. Finally, area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the entire
network is determined, and SINR coverage probability expression for a more
general model is presented by considering that UAVs are located at different
heights. Via numerical results, we have shown that UAV height and path-loss
exponents play important roles on the coverage performance. Moreover, coverage
probability can be improved with smaller number of UAVs, while better area
spectral efficiency is achieved by employing more UAVs and having UEs more
compactly clustered around the UAVs.

light and allowing high bandwidth optical transmission for long distance

efficient for transmitting light, its functionality is limited by the
dielectric properties of the materials of core and cladding.The light coming
out from optical fiber is typically diverging, and the numerical aperture is
determined by the refractive index of the fiber materials. Thus, the light
intensity decreases significantly upon exiting the fiber. The use of
metasurfaces provides the opportunity to tailor light properties for advanced
light manipulation and to develop novel optical applications that are flat. By
producing a specific phase profile using spatially-varied nano-antenna
elements, metasurfaces can control the wavefront of the transmitted, reflected,
and scattered light, and enable novel ultrathin optical components such as flat
lenses. Here, we report an ultrathin optical metalens cascaded on the facet of
optical fiber that enables light focusing in the telecommunication regime.
In-fiber metalenses with focal lengths of 28 and 40 um and maximum efficiency
of ~16.4% at a wavelength of 1550 nm are demonstrated. The integration of an
ultrathin metalens and optical fiber will open the path to revolutionary
in-fiber optical devices for practical applications in optical imaging,

poly-crystalline bulk and sharp MIT around 200 K. Negative magnetoresistance
and positive Hall coefficient were found, which became pronounced below 200 K.
The valence-band and core-levels photoemission spectra indicated the drastic
changes across the MIT. In the valence band photoemission spectrum, the finite
density of states was observed at the Fermi level in the metallic phase. In
contrast, an energy gap appeared in the insulating phase. The split of W 4f
core-level spectrum suggested the charge disproportionation of W5+ and W6+ in
the insulating phase. The change of spectral shape in the Cs 4d core levels
reflected the rattling motion of Cs+ cations. These results strongly suggest
that CsW2O6 is a novel material, in which MIT is driven by the charge

domain adaptation problem as an embedding projection task. Our model takes as
input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a
bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and
to (2) predict sentiment. We perform domain adaptation experiments on 20
source-target domain pairs for sentiment classification and report novel

superfluid at the dimensional crossover from three to two dimensions. We find
that the simple model of a 2D Fermi gas with a single $s$-wave scattering

resources through offloading to network elements (programmable switches and
smart NICs). In particular, the data plane programming language P4 together
with powerful P4 networking hardware has spawned projects offloading services
into the network, e.g., consensus services or caching services. In this paper,
we present a novel case for in-network computing, namely, Complex Event
Processing (CEP). CEP processes streams of basic events, e.g., stemming from
networked sensors, into meaningful complex events. Traditionally, CEP
processing has been performed on servers or overlay networks. However, we argue
in this paper that CEP is a good candidate for in-network computing along the
communication path avoiding detouring streams to distant servers to minimize
communication latency while also exploiting processing capabilities of novel
networking hardware. We show that it is feasible to express CEP operations in
P4 and also present a tool to compile CEP operations, formulated in our P4CEP
rule specification language, to P4 code. Moreover, we identify challenges and
problems that we have encountered to show future research directions for
implementing full-fledged in-network CEP systems.

weak focus, and the number and distribution of limit cycles in the first

by applying Dulac's criterion and constructing the Liapunov function. If system
has three distinct positive equilibria, then one of them is a saddle and the
others are both anti-saddles. For two anti-saddles, we prove that the Hopf
cyclicity for positive equilibrium with smaller abscissa (resp. bigger

graphene (G) can effectively screen dispersion van der Waals (vdW) interactions
deriving from the underlying substrate: despite the single-atom thickness of G,
the AFM tip was almost insensitive to SiO$_2$, and the tip-substrate attraction
was essentially determined only by G. This G vdW {\it opacity} has far reaching
implications, encompassing stabilization of multilayer heterostructures,
micromechanical phenomena or even heterogeneous catalysis. Yet, detailed
experimental control and high-end applications of this phenomenon await sound
physical understanding of the underlying physical mechanism. By quantum
many-body analysis and ab-initio Density Functional Theory, here we address
this challenge providing theoretical rationalization of the observed G vdW {\it
opacity} for weakly interacting substrates. The non-local density response and
ultra slow decay of the G vdW interaction ensure compensation between standard
attractive terms and many-body repulsive contributions, enabling vdW {\it
opacity} over a broad range of adsorption distances. vdW {\it opacity} appears
most efficient in the low frequency limit and extends beyond London dispersion
including electrostatic Debye forces. By virtue of combined
theoretical/experimental validation, G hence emerges as a promising ultrathin

We show how this error affects the absolute measurement of the gravitational

based on atom interferometry such as those designed for space geodesy, the
measurement of the universal constant of gravity and the detection of
gravitational waves. When atom interferometers test the universality of free
fall and the weak equivalence principle by dropping different isotopes of the
same atom one laser interrogates both isotopes and the error reported here
cancels out. With atom clouds of different species and two lasers of different
frequencies the phase shifts measured by the interferometer differ by a large
amount even in absence of violation. Systematic errors, including common mode
accelerations coupled to the gravity gradient with the reported error, lead to
hard concurrent requirements --on the ground and in space-- on several

examine the Hopf bifurcation and global dynamics of a predator-prey model of

cases: (A) when it has a unique non-degenerate positive equilibrium; (B) when
it has three distinct positive equilibria. For each case, the type and
stability of each equilibrium, Hopf bifurcation at each weak focus, and the
number and distribution of limit cycles in the first quadrant are studied. It
is shown that every equilibrium is not a center. For the case (A), $i$ limit
cycle(s) can appear near the unique positive equilibrium, $i=1, \cdots, 4$. For
$i=3$ or $4$, the model has two stable limit cycles, which gives a positive
answer to the open problem proposed by Coleman [Differential equations
model,1983]: finding at least two ecologically stable cycles in any natural (or
laboratory) predator-prey system. For the case (B), one positive equilibrium is
a saddle and the others are both anti-saddle. If one of the two anti-saddles is
weak focus and the other is not, then the order of the weak focus is at most
$3$. If both anti-saddles are weak foci, then they are unstable weak foci of
order one. Moreover, one limit cycle can bifurcate from each of them
simultaneously. Numerical simulations demonstrate that there is also a big
stable limit cycle enclosing these two limit cycles. Our results indicate that
the maximum number of limit cycles in the model of this kind is at least $4$,
which improves the preceding results that this number is at least $2$.

($\Lambda$CDM) model. From $Om(a)$ diagnostic, we find that our model has a
relatively large deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts and
gradually approaches the $\Lambda$CDM model at low redshifts and in the future
evolution, but they can be easily differentiated from each other at the
1$\sigma$ level all along. By the statefinder, we find that both of
quintessence case and phantom case can be well distinguished from the
$\Lambda$CDM model and will gradually deviate from each other. Finally, we
discuss the fate of universe evolution (named the rip analysis) for the phantom
case of our model and find that the universe will run into a little rip stage.

on modulation spaces, and related topics. However, our approach, based on the
Grossmann-Royer transform, gives a new insight and (slightly) different proofs.
We define the Grossmann-Royer transform as interpretation of the
Grossmann-Royer operator in the weak sense. Although such transform is
essentially the same as the cross-Wigner distribution, the proofs of several
known results are simplified when it is used instead of other time-frequency
representations. Due to the importance of their role in applications when
dealing with ultrafast decay properties in phase space, we give a detailed
account on the Gelfand-Shilov spaces and their dual spaces, and extend the
Grossmann-Royer transform and its properties in such context. Another family of
spaces, modulation spaces, are recognized as appropriate background for
time-frequency analysis. In particular, the Gelfand-Shilov spaces are revealed
as projective and inductive limits of modulation spaces. For the continuity and
compactness properties of localization operators we employ the norms in
modulation spaces. We define localization operators in terms of the
Grossmann-Royer transform, and show that such definition coincides with the
usual definition based on the short-time Fourier transform.

diversity of instruments and apertures, the observed spectrum of linear
continuum polarization has distinctive wavelength-dependent signatures that can
be related to the AGN and host galaxy physics. The impact of the Big Blue bump

the polarization in the optical band. We also investigate the effect of

competition: authors manipulate their documents so as to promote them in
rankings. Such competitions can have unwarranted effects not only in terms of
retrieval effectiveness, but also in terms of ranking robustness. A case in
point, rankings can (rapidly) change due to small indiscernible perturbations
of documents. While there has been a recent growing interest in analyzing the
robustness of classifiers to adversarial manipulations, there has not yet been
a study of the robustness of relevance-ranking functions. We address this
challenge by formally analyzing different definitions and aspects of the
robustness of learning-to-rank-based ranking functions. For example, we
formally show that increased regularization of linear ranking functions
increases ranking robustness. This finding leads us to conjecture that
decreased variance of any ranking function results in increased robustness. We
propose several measures for quantifying ranking robustness and use them to
analyze ranking competitions between documents' authors. The empirical findings
support our formal analysis and conjecture for both RankSVM and LambdaMART.

remains an issue in the theory of their formation and hence of the solar
system. Whether the fractionated reservoir traced by comets is inherited from
the interstellar cloud or is the product of processes taking place in the
protostar, or in the protoplanetary disk, remains unclear. So far, observations
of nitrogen isotopic ratios in protostars or prestellar cores have not securely
identified such a fractionated reservoir owing to the intrinsic difficulty of
direct isotopic ratios measurements. In this article, we report the detection
of 5 rotational lines of \ce{HC3N}, {including the weaker components of the
hyperfine multiplets}, and two rotational lines of its $^{15}$N isotopologue,
towards the L1544 prestellar core. Based on a MCMC/non-LTE multi-line analysis
at the hyperfine level, we derive the column densities of \ce{HC3N}
($8.0\pm0.4\tdix{13}$\cc) and \ce{HC3^{15}N} ($2.0\pm0.4\tdix{11}$\cc) and
derive an isotopic ratio of 400$\pm$20(1$\sigma$). This value suggests that
\ce{HC3N} is slightly depleted in $^{15}$N in L1544 with respect to the
elemental $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio {of $\approx$330} in the present-day local
interstellar medium. Our study also stresses the need for radiative
calculations at the hyperfine level. Finally, the comparison of the derived

CN+C$_2$H$_2$ as the dominant formation route to HC$_3$N. However,

this paper to present a general method that allows us to find distribution
functions consisting of a finite number of terms (therefore easier to use in
practice), but which still allow for current sheet equilibria that can, in
principle, have an arbitrarily low plasma beta. The method involves using known
solutions and transforming them into new solutions using transformations based
on taking integer powers ($N$) of one component of the pressure tensor. The
plasma beta of the current sheet corresponding to the transformed distribution
functions can then, in principle, have values as low as $1/N$. We present the
general form of the distribution functions for arbitrary $N$ and then, as a

properties of both fermionic and bosonic two-site Hubbard models with a pair of
interacting atoms in a trap with a double-well structure along z-axis and a 2D
harmonic confinement along the transverse directions. We consider fermions as
of two-component type and bosons as of spinless as well as of two spin
components. We first discuss building up the Hubbard models using the model
finite-range interaction potentials of Jost and Kohn. In general, a finite
range of interaction leads to on-site, inter-site, exchange and
partial-exchange terms. We show that, given the same input parameters for both
bosonic and fermionic two-site Hubbard models, many of the statistical
properties such as the single- and double-occupancy of a site, and the
probabilities for the single-particle and pair tunneling are similar in both
fermionic and bosonic cases. But, quantum entanglement and quantum fluctuations
are found to be markedly different for the two cases. We discuss atom-atom
entanglement in two spatial modes corresponding to the two sites of the
double-well. Our results show that the entanglement of a pair of spin-half
fermions is always greater than that of spinless bosons; and when the fermions
are maximally entangled the fluctuation in the two-mode phase difference is
largely squeezed. In contrast, spinless bosons never exhibit phase squeezing,

parameters.

accuracy. In the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, ML-As exhibits two
sets of Landau levels linear with respect to the magnetic field and level
index. Our numerical calculation of the optical conductivity reveals that the
obtained optical gap is very close to the GW0 value and can be effectively
tuned by external magnetic field. Thus, our proposed TB model can be used for
further large-scale simulations of the electronic, optical and transport
properties of ML-As.

The third uses the field hiding preconditioner within a direct Newton iteration

outperforms all method. We compare these implementations with a recent

This allows us to obtain functional maps that promote orientation preservation,

The theory is based on the spin Husimi-Q function and its corresponding
phase-space entropy, known as Wehrl entropy. Unlike the von Neumann entropy
production rate, we show that in our framework, the Wehrl entropy roduction
rate remains valid at any temperature and is also readily extended to arbitrary

the studying of the environmental effects on galaxy formation. A reliable
detection of galaxy groups is an open problem and is important for ongoing and
future cosmological surveys.
  We propose a probabilistic galaxy group detection algorithm based on marked
point processes with interactions.
  The pattern of galaxy groups in a catalogue is seen as a random set of
interacting objects. The positions and the interactions of these objects are
governed by a probability density. The estimator of the unknown cluster pattern
is given by the configuration of objects maximising the proposed probability
density. Adopting the Bayesian framework, the proposed probability density is
maximised using a simulated annealing algorithm. The method provides ""for free""
additional information such as the probabilities that a point or two points in
the observation domain belong to the cluster pattern, respectively. These
supplementary tools allow the construction of tests and techniques to validate
and to refine the detection result.
  To test the feasibility of the proposed methodology, we applied it to the
well-studied 2MRS data set. Compared to previously published Friends-of-Friends
(FoF) group finders, the proposed Bayesian group finder gives overall similar
results.
  The proposed Bayesian group finder is tested on a galaxy redshift survey, but
more detailed analyses are needed to understand the actual capabilities of the
algorithm regarding upcoming cosmological surveys. The presented mathematical
framework permits adapting it easily for other data sets (in astronomy and in
other fields of sciences). In cosmology, one promising application is the
detection of galaxy groups in photometric galaxy redshift surveys, while taking
into account the full photometric redshift posteriors. (abridged)

the current performance of the player. Specifically, we read the Player Health

achieved in the nano-antenna's zero scattering direction, which varies linearly

even higher sensitivity to tiny displacement or phase changes can be reached
around chosen location. The high sensitivity of the proposed method can form
the basis for many applications.

holds. Here, $|m|$ is the usual absolute value of the integer $m$, $|m|_p$ its
$p$-adic absolute value and $ |\langle x\rangle|$ denotes the distance from a
real number $x$ to the set of integers. This still open conjecture stands as a
variant of the well-known Littlewood Conjecture. In the same way as the latter,
it admits a natural counterpart over the field of formal Laurent series
$\mathbb{K}\left(\left(t^{-1}\right)\right)$ of a ground field $\mathbb{K}$.
This is the so-called \emph{$t$-adic Littlewood Conjecture} ($t$-LC).
  It is known that $t$--LC fails when the ground field $\mathbb{K}$ is
infinite. This article is concerned with the much more difficult case when the
latter field is finite. More precisely, a \emph{fully explicit} counterexample
is provided to show that $t$-LC does not hold in the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is
a finite field with characteristic 3. Generalizations to fields with
characteristics different from 3 are also discussed.
  The proof is computer assisted. It reduces to showing that an infinite matrix
encoding Hankel determinants of the Paper-Folding sequence over $\mathbb{F}_3$,
the so-called Number Wall of this sequence, can be obtained as a
two-dimensional automatic tiling satisfying a finite number of suitable local
constraints.

their importance is evaluated via statistics by finding the power-law index of
the energy distribution. This method is however biased due to technical and
physical reasons. We aim to overcome limitations imposed by observations and
statistical analysis. This way, we will identify, and study the small scale
impulsive events. We employ a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD)
simulation using the \bifrost code. We also employ a new technique to identify
the evolution of 3D Joule heating events in the corona. Then, we derive
parameters describing the heating events in these locations. We report on the
identification of heating events. We obtain the distribution of duration,
released energy, and volume. We also find weak power-law correlation between
these parameters. In addition, we extract information about geometrical
parameters of 2D slices of 3D events, and about the evolution of resolved Joule
heating compared to the total Joule heating and the magnetic energy in the
corona. Even though the energy power index is less than 2, when classifying the
energy release into three categories regarding with respect to the energy
release (pico-, nano-, and micro-events), we find that nano-events release $82
\ \%$ of the resolved energy. This fraction corresponds to an energy flux
larger than the one needed to heat the corona. It seems that the most popular
population is the one containing short-lived, with small spatial extend events.

activities using the BoGEMMS framework. An SPO mirror module row is the atomic
unit of the mass model, allowing the simulation of the full structure by means
of 20 independent runs, one for each row. Thanks to the BoGEMMS configuration
files, both single pores, mirror modules or the entire SPO row can be built
with the same Geant4 geometry. Both Remizovich, in its elastic approximation,

mono-energetic proton beams with a single SPO pore. The scattering efficiency
for the first model is almost twice the efficiency obtained with the latter but
for both cases we obtain similar polar and azimuthal angular distributions,
with about 70-75% of scatterings generated by single or double reflections. The
soft proton flux modelled for the plasma sheet region is used as input for the
simulation of soft proton funnelling by the full SPO mass model. A much weaker
soft proton vignetting than the one observed by XMM-Newton EPIC detectors is

ambiguity, we consider more appropriate a quantum field theoretical (QFT)

the Planck scale is approached. A posteriori, a connection between the two

adopt a QFT inspired by the Higgs mechanism, in the sense that a massive scalar
field develops a non-trivial vacuum for m>\mu_{Pl}. Exictations around this
vacuum are Planckian objects we name ""black particles"" to remark the ambiguous
identity of these objects, as it has been mentioned above. A black particle
eventually turns into a ""quantum black hole"" when the Schwarzschild radius
becomes larger than its Compton wavelength. However, for m=\mu_{Pl} the scalar
field is massless at the tree-level, but develops a non-trivial vacuum at
one-loop through a Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. In this case, excitations
describe Planck mass black particles.

high energy efficiency, low greenhouse gas emissions, and high reliability.
However, due to mechanical limitations related to fuel delivery, fuel cells are
slow to adjust to sudden increases in data center power demands, which can
result in temporary power shortfalls. To mitigate the impact of power
shortfalls, prior work has proposed to either perform power capping by
throttling the servers, or to leverage energy storage devices (ESDs) that can
temporarily provide enough power to make up for the shortfall while the fuel
cells ramp up power generation. Both approaches have disadvantages: power
capping conservatively limits server performance and can lead to service level
agreement (SLA) violations, while ESD-only solutions must significantly
overprovision the energy storage device capacity to tolerate the shortfalls
caused by the worst-case (i.e., largest) power surges, which greatly increases
the total cost of ownership (TCO).
  We propose SizeCap, the first ESD sizing framework for fuel cell powered data
centers, which coordinates ESD sizing with power capping to enable a
cost-effective solution to power shortfalls in data centers. SizeCap sizes the
ESD just large enough to cover the majority of power surges, but not the
worst-case surges that occur infrequently, to greatly reduce TCO. It then uses
the smaller capacity ESD in conjunction with power capping to cover the power
shortfalls caused by the worst-case power surges. As part of our new flexible
framework, we propose multiple power capping policies with different degrees of
awareness of fuel cell and workload behavior, and evaluate their impact on
workload performance and ESD size. Using traces from Microsoft's production
data center systems, we demonstrate that SizeCap significantly reduces the ESD
size without violating any SLAs.

length scales in canine ventricles via spatiotemporal correlation analysis as a
function of stimulation frequency and during fibrillation. We show that i)
length scales can vary from 40 to 20 cm during one to one responses, ii) a
critical decay length for the onset of the period-doubling bifurcation is
present and decreases to less than 3 cm before the transition to fibrillation

this evidence, we provide a novel theoretical description of cardiac decay
lengths introducing an experimental-based conduction velocity dispersion
relation that fits the measured wavelengths with a fractional diffusion
exponent of 1.5. We show that an accurate phenomenological mathematical model
of the cardiac action potential, fine-tuned upon classical restitution
protocols, can provide the correct decay lengths during periodic stimulations

amount of time series data that are being created over a wide variety of
fields. The particularity of the data makes it a challenging task and different
approaches have been taken, including the distance based approach. 1-NN has
been a widely used method within distance based time series classification due
to it simplicity but still good performance. However, its supremacy may be
attributed to being able to use specific distances for time series within the
classification process and not to the classifier itself. With the aim of
exploiting these distances within more complex classifiers, new approaches have
arisen in the past few years that are competitive or which outperform the 1-NN
based approaches. In some cases, these new methods use the distance measure to
transform the series into feature vectors, bridging the gap between time series
and traditional classifiers. In other cases, the distances are employed to
obtain a time series kernel and enable the use of kernel methods for time
series classification. One of the main challenges is that a kernel function
must be positive semi-definite, a matter that is also addressed within this
review. The presented review includes a taxonomy of all those methods that aim
to classify time series using a distance based approach, as well as a

A $\gamma$-structure is constructed by nesting and concatenating specific
building components having topological genus at most $\gamma$. A block is a
substructure enclosed by crossing maximal arcs with respect to the partial
order induced by nesting. We show that, in uniformly generated
$\gamma$-structures, there is a significant gap in this length-spectrum, i.e.,
there asymptotically almost surely exists a unique longest block of length at

  Lett. B",,"10.1016/j.physletb.2018.08.015",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an analysis on the production of two same-sign lepton pairs at the
LHC, mediated by bileptons in the $SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_X$ theory,
the so-called 331 model. Compared to other 331 scenarios, in this model the
embedding of the hypercharge is obtained with the addition of 3 exotic quarks
and doubly-charged vector gauge bosons with lepton numbers $\pm 2$ in the
spectrum ($Y^{\pm\pm}$), which can mediate the production of four-lepton final
states. Furthermore, a complete description of the model requires the
introduction of a Higgs scalar sector, which is a sextet of $SU(3)_L$,
necessary in order to correctly account for the lepton masses. As a result of
this, new doubly-charged scalar states $H^{\pm\pm}$ are part of the spectrum as
well and can in principle compete with the vector bileptons in giving rise to
four-lepton final states. We investigate both channels and study several
observables at the LHC, for both signal and Standard Model $ZZ$ background.
With respect to previous work on vector- and scalar-bilepton production, we use
the most updated exclusion limits at the LHC and implement the 331 model in a
full Monte Carlo simulation code, capable of being interfaced with any analysis
framework. Our result is that the 331 signal can be discriminated from the
background with a significance of 6-9 standard deviations, depending on the LHC
luminosity, with the vector bileptons dominating over the scalar ones.

(MR) images for guiding targeted prostate biopsy has significantly improved the
biopsy yield of aggressive cancers. A key component of MR-TRUS fusion is image
registration. However, it is very challenging to obtain a robust automatic
MR-TRUS registration due to the large appearance difference between the two
imaging modalities. The work presented in this paper aims to tackle this
problem by addressing two challenges: (i) the definition of a suitable
similarity metric and (ii) the determination of a suitable optimization
strategy.
  Methods: This work proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network to
learn a similarity metric for MR-TRUS registration. We also use a composite
optimization strategy that explores the solution space in order to search for a
suitable initialization for the second-order optimization of the learned
metric. Further, a multi-pass approach is used in order to smooth the metric
for optimization.
  Results: The learned similarity metric outperforms the classical mutual
information and also the state-of-the-art MIND feature based methods. The
results indicate that the overall registration framework has a large capture
range. The proposed deep similarity metric based approach obtained a mean TRE
of 3.86mm (with an initial TRE of 16mm) for this challenging problem.
  Conclusion: A similarity metric that is learned using a deep neural network
can be used to assess the quality of any given image registration and can be
used in conjunction with the aforementioned optimization framework to perform
automatic registration that is robust to poor initialization.

with brightness-peaks at tens-of-gigahertz frequencies. The emission's origins
are uncertain - rapidly-spinning nano-particles could emit electric-dipole
radiation, but polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons proposed as the carrier are now
found not to correlate with Galactic signals. The difficulty is to identify
co-spatial sources over long lines of sight. Here we identify anomalous
microwave emission in three proto-planetary discs. These are the only known
systems that host hydrogenated nano-diamonds, in contrast to very common
detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Spectroscopy locates the
nano-diamonds close to the host-stars, at physically-constrained temperatures.
Developing disc models, we reproduce the emission with diamonds 0.75-1.1
nanometres in radius, holding less than or equal to 1-2 per cent of the carbon
budget. The microwave-emission:stellar-luminosity ratios are approximately
constant, allowing nano-diamonds to be ubiquitous but emitting below detection
thresholds in many star-systems. This can unify the findings with similar-sized
diamonds found within solar system meteorites. As nano-diamond spectral
absorption is seen in interstellar sightlines, these particles are also a

error and randomness expansion with logarithmic input entropy. QPE is
implemented by constructing model-dependent quantum estimation factors (QEFs),
which yield statistical confidence upper bounds on data-conditional normalized
R\'enyi powers. This leads to conditional min-entropy estimates for randomness
generation. The bounds are valid for relevant models of sequences of
experimental trials without requiring independent and identical or stationary
behavior. QEFs may be adapted to changing conditions during the sequence and
trials can be stopped any time, such as when the results so far are
satisfactory. QEFs can be constructed from entropy estimators to improve the
bounds for conditional min-entropy of classical-quantum states from the entropy
accumulation framework [Dupuis, Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1607.01796]. QEFs are
applicable to a larger class of models, including models permitting
experimental devices with super-quantum but non-signaling behaviors and
semi-device dependent models. The improved bounds are relevant for finite data
or error bounds of the form $e^{-\kappa s}$, where $s$ is the number of random
bits produced. We give a general construction of entropy estimators based on
maximum probability estimators, which exist for many configurations. For the
class of $(k,2,2)$ Bell-test configurations we provide schemas for directly
optimizing QEFs to overcome the limitations of entropy-estimator-based
constructions. We obtain and apply QEFs for examples involving the $(2,2,2)$

one of the most common tools to measure the radius of neutron stars (NSs) for
over a decade. So far, this method has been mainly applied to NSs in globular
clusters, primarily because of their well-constrained distances. Here, we study
Chandra data of seven transient LMXBs in the Galactic plane in quiescence to
investigate the potential of constraining the radius (and mass) of the NSs
inhabiting these systems. We find that only two of these objects had X-ray
spectra of sufficient quality to obtain reasonable constraints on the radius,
with the most stringent being an upper limit of $R\lesssim$14.5 km for EXO
0748-676 (for assumed ranges for mass and distance). Using these seven sources,
we also investigate systematic biases on the mass/radius determination; for Aql
X-1 we find that omitting a power-law spectral component when it does not seem
to be required by the data, results in peculiar trends in the obtained radius
with changing mass and distance. For EXO 0748-676 we find that a slight
variation in the lower limit of the energy range chosen for the fit leads to
systematically different masses and radii. Finally, we simulated Athena spectra
and found that some of the biases can be lifted when higher quality spectra are
available and that, in general, the search for constraints on the equation of
state of ultra-dense matter via NS radius and mass measurements may receive a
considerable boost in the future.

represented by the two lowest levels of a qutrit placed in a cavity. We show
that this n-qubit controlled phase gate can be realized using only 2n+2 basic

linearly with the number n of qubits. Since each basic operation employs the
qutrit-cavity or qutrit-pulse resonant interaction, the gate can be fast
implemented when the number of qubits is not large. Numerical simulations show
that a three-qubit controlled phase gate, which is executed on three qubits

using a circuit QED system. This proposal is quite general and can be applied

formalism} (Stillinger & Weber, 1982), extensively used in analysing Spin
Glasses, we propose a novel measure called \emph{Inherent Structure Capacity}
(ISC), which characterizes the representation capacity of a fixed architecture
RBM by the expected number of modes of distributions emanating from the RBM
with parameters drawn from a prior distribution. Though ISC is intractable, we
show that for a single layer RBM architecture ISC approaches a finite constant
as number of hidden units are increased and to further improve the ISC, one
needs to add a second layer. Furthermore, we introduce \emph{Lean} RBMs, which
are multi-layer RBMs where each layer can have at-most $O(n)$ units with the
number of visible units being n. We show that for every single layer RBM with
$\Omega(n^{2+r}), r \ge 0$, hidden units there exists a two-layered \emph{lean}
RBM with $\Theta(n^2)$ parameters with the same ISC, establishing that 2 layer
RBMs can achieve the same representational power as single-layer RBMs but using

Morse functions with just 2 singular points on homotopy spheres. Canonical
projections of unit spheres are simplest examples of such maps and manifolds
admitting special generic maps into the plane are completely determined by
Saeki in 1993 and ones admitting such maps into general Euclidean spaces are
determined under appropriate conditions. Moreover, if the difference of
dimensions of source and target manifolds are not so large, then the
diffeomorphism types of source manifolds are often limited. These explicit
facts make special generic maps attractive objects in the theory of Morse
functions and higher dimensional versions and application to algebraic and
differentiable topology of manifolds, which is an important study in both
singuarity theory of maps and algebraic and differential topology of manifolds.
  In this paper, we demonstrate a way of construction of special generic maps
into the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. For this, first we prepare maps onto
2-dimensional polyhedra regarded as simplicial maps naturally called pseudo
quotient maps, which are generalizations of the quotient maps to the spaces of
all the connected components of inverse images, so-called Reeb spaces of
original smooth maps, being fundamental and important tools in the studies.
  The success of the construction explicitly shows that a class of maps which

the network component on which it resides into two or more components. APs are
vulnerable spots that play an important role in network collapse processes,
which may result from node failures, attacks or epidemics. Therefore, the
abundance and properties of APs affect the resilience of the network to these
collapse scenarios. We present analytical results for the statistical
properties of APs in configuration model networks. In order to quantify their
abundance, we calculate the probability $P(i \in {\rm AP})$, that a random
node, i, in a configuration model network with P(K=k), is an AP. We also obtain
the conditional probability $P(i \in {\rm AP}|k)$ that a random node of degree
k is an AP, and find that high degree nodes are more likely to be APs than low
degree nodes. Using Bayes' theorem, we obtain the conditional degree
distribution, $P(K=k|{\rm AP})$, over the set of APs and compare it to P(K=k).
We propose a new centrality measure based on APs: each node can be
characterized by its articulation rank, r, which is the number of components
that would be added to the network upon deletion of that node. For nodes which
are not APs the articulation rank is $r=0$, while for APs $r \ge 1$. We obtain
a closed form expression for the distribution of articulation ranks, P(R=r).
Configuration model networks often exhibit a coexistence between a giant
component and finite components. To examine the distinct properties of APs on
the giant and on the finite components, we calculate the probabilities
presented above separately for the giant and the finite components. We apply
these results to ensembles of configuration model networks with a Poisson,
exponential and power-law degree distributions. The implications of these
results are discussed in the context of common attack scenarios and network
dismantling processes.

evidence of life, such as the presence of biogenic gases like O2 or CH4.
However, the expected diversity of terrestrial planet atmospheres and the
likelihood of both false positives and false negatives for conventional
biosignatures motivate exploration of additional life detection strategies,
including time-varying signals. Seasonal variation in atmospheric composition
is a biologically modulated phenomenon on Earth that may occur elsewhere
because it arises naturally from the interplay between the biosphere and
time-variable insolation. The search for seasonality as a biosignature would
avoid many assumptions about specific metabolisms and provide an opportunity to
directly quantify biological fluxes--allowing us to characterize, rather than
simply recognize, biospheres on exoplanets. Despite this potential, there have
been no comprehensive studies of seasonality as an exoplanet biosignature.
Here, we provide a foundation for further studies by reviewing both biological
and abiological controls on the magnitude and detectability of seasonality of
atmospheric CO2, CH4, O2, and O3 on Earth. We also consider an example of an
inhabited world for which atmospheric seasonality may be the most notable
expression of its biosphere. We show that life on a low O2 planet like the
weakly oxygenated mid-Proterozoic Earth could be fingerprinted by seasonal
variation in O3 as revealed in its UV Hartley-Huggins bands. This example
highlights the need for UV capabilities in future direct-imaging telescope
missions (e.g., LUVOIR/HabEx) and illustrates the diagnostic importance of
studying temporal biosignatures for exoplanet life detection/characterization.

atrial fibrillation (AF) patients has recently emerged as a promising technique
to stratify patients, guide ablation therapy and predict treatment success.
Visualisation and quantification of scar tissues require a segmentation of both
the left atrium (LA) and the high intensity scar regions from LGE-CMRI images.
These two segmentation tasks are challenging due to the cancelling of healthy
tissue signal, low signal-to-noise ratio and often limited image quality in
these patients. Most approaches require manual supervision and/or a second
bright-blood MRI acquisition for anatomical segmentation. Segmenting both the
LA anatomy and the scar tissues automatically from a single LGE-CMRI
acquisition is highly in demand. In this study, we proposed a novel fully
automated multiview two-task (MVTT) recursive attention model working directly
on LGE-CMRI images that combines a sequential learning and a dilated residual
learning to segment the LA (including attached pulmonary veins) and delineate
the atrial scars simultaneously via an innovative attention model. Compared to
other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed MVTT achieves compelling
improvement, enabling to generate a patient-specific anatomical and atrial scar
assessment model.

distribution for the ferromagnetic Ising model on a graph $G=(V,E)$. The
dynamics is a ""global"" Markov chain which is conjectured to converge to
equilibrium in $O(|V|^{1/4})$ steps for any graph $G$ at any (inverse)
temperature $\beta$. It was recently proved by Guo and Jerrum (2017) that the
Swendsen-Wang dynamics has polynomial mixing time on any graph at all
temperatures, yet there are few results providing $o(|V|)$ upper bounds on its
convergence time.
  We prove fast convergence of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics on general graphs in
the tree uniqueness region of the ferromagnetic Ising model. In particular,
when $\beta < \beta_c(d)$ where $\beta_c(d)$ denotes the
uniqueness/non-uniqueness threshold on infinite $d$-regular trees, we prove
that the relaxation time (i.e., the inverse spectral gap) of the Swendsen-Wang
dynamics is $\Theta(1)$ on any graph of maximum degree $d \geq 3$. Our proof
utilizes a version of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics which only updates isolated
vertices. We establish that this variant of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics has
mixing time $O(\log{|V|})$ and relaxation time $\Theta(1)$ on any graph of
maximum degree $d$ for all $\beta < \beta_c(d)$. We believe that this Markov
chain may be of independent interest, as it is a monotone Swendsen-Wang type
chain. As part of our proofs, we provide modest extensions of the technology of
Mossel and Sly (2013) for analyzing mixing times and of the censoring result of
Peres and Winkler (2013). Both of these results are for the Glauber dynamics,
and we extend them here to general monotone Markov chains. This class of
dynamics includes for example the heat-bath block dynamics, for which we obtain
new tight mixing time bounds.

positive solutions to non-local in time diffusion equations by constructing a
counter-example for dimensions $d\ge\beta$, where $\beta\in(0,2]$ is the order
of the equation with respect to the spatial variable. The equation can be
non-local both in time and in space but for the counter-example it is important
that the equation has a fractional time derivative. In this case, the
fundamental solution is singular at the origin for all times $t>0$ in
dimensions $d\ge\beta$. This underlines the markedly different behavior of
time-fractional diffusion compared to the purely space-fractional case, where a
local Harnack inequality is known.
  The key observation is that the memory strongly affects the estimates. In
particular, if the initial data $u_0 \in L^q_{loc}$ for $q$ larger than the
critical value $\tfrac d\beta$ of the elliptic operator $(-\Delta)^{\beta/2}$,
a non-local version of the Harnack inequality is still valid as we show.
  We also observe the critical dimension phenomenon already known from other
contexts: the diffusion behavior is substantially different in higher
dimensions than $d=1$ provided $\beta>1$, since we prove that the local Harnack
inequality holds if $d<\beta$.

We provide theoretical support for this alternative hypothesis, by

But apart from
prescriptive advice, there is little practical support or quantitative
understanding of what makes a comment useful. In this paper, we introduce the
task of identifying comments which are uninformative about the code they are
meant to document. To address this problem, we introduce the notion of comment
entailment from code, high entailment indicating that a comment's natural
language semantics can be inferred directly from the code. Although not all
entailed comments are low quality, comments that are too easily inferred, for
example, comments that restate the code, are widely discouraged by authorities
on software style. Based on this, we develop a tool called CRAIC which scores
method-level comments for redundancy. Highly redundant comments can then be
expanded or alternately removed by the developer. CRAIC uses deep language
models to exploit large software corpora without requiring expensive manual
annotations of entailment. We show that CRAIC can perform the comment
entailment task with good agreement with human judgements. Our findings also
have implications for documentation tools. For example, we find that common
tags in Javadoc are at least two times more predictable from code than
non-Javadoc sentences, suggesting that Javadoc tags are less informative than
more free-form comments

  chapter accepted for publication in the Handbook of Exoplanets under title
  ""Spectroscopic direct detection of exoplanets""",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spectrum of an exoplanet reveals the physical, chemical, and biological
processes that have shaped its history and govern its future. However,
observations of exoplanet spectra are complicated by the overwhelming glare of
their host stars. This review chapter focuses on high resolution spectroscopy
(HRS; R=25,000-100,000), which helps to disentangle and isolate the exoplanet's
spectrum. At high spectral resolution, molecular features are resolved into a
dense forest of individual lines in a pattern that is unique for a given
molecule. For close-in planets, the spectral lines undergo large Doppler shifts
during the planet's orbit, while the host star and Earth's spectral features
remain essentially stationary, enabling a velocity separation of the planet.
For slower-moving, wide-orbit planets, HRS aided by high contrast imaging
instead isolates their spectra using their spatial separation. The lines in the
exoplanet spectrum are detected by comparing them with high resolution spectra
from atmospheric modelling codes; essentially a form of fingerprinting for
exoplanet atmospheres. This measures the planet's orbital velocity, and helps
define its true mass and orbital inclination. Consequently, HRS can detect both
transiting and non-transiting planets. It also simultaneously characterizes the
planet's atmosphere due to its sensitivity to the depth, shape, and position of
the planet's spectral lines. These are altered by the planet's atmospheric
composition, structure, clouds, and dynamics, including day-to-night winds and
its rotation period. This chapter describes the HRS technique in detail,
highlighting its successes in exoplanet detection and characterization, and
concludes with the future prospects of using HRS to identify biomarkers on
nearby rocky worlds, and map features in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets.

explore several detrending procedures, i.e. polynomials and the Cosine
Filtering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM). We then supply a light
curve simulator with the co-planar orbital dynamics of the system and fit the
resulting planet-moon transit light curves to the Kepler data. We employ the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether a single planet or a
planet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve
variations. We carry out a blind hare-and-hounds exercise using many noise
realizations by injecting simulated transits into different out-of-transit
parts of the original Kepler-1625 data: 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits
of a Kepler-1625b-like planet and 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits of
this planet with a Neptune-sized moon. The statistical significance and
characteristics of the exomoon-like signal strongly depend on the detrending
method, and the data chosen for detrending, and on the treatment of gaps in the
light curve. Our injection-retrieval experiment shows evidence for moons in
about 10% of those light curves that do not contain an injected moon.
Strikingly, many of these false-positive moons resemble the exomoon candidate.
We recover up to about half of the injected moons, depending on the detrending
method, with radii and orbital distances broadly corresponding to the injected
values. A $\Delta$BIC of -4.9 for the CoFiAM-based detrending indicates an
exomoon around Kepler-1625b. This solution, however, is only one out of many
and we find very different solutions depending on the details of the detrending
method. It is worrying that the detrending is key to the interpretation of the
data.

charge separation distance of an electric dipole, which in turn is much smaller
than a distance up to the point of observation. The electric dipole considered
in this paper is the one with fixed charge positions, but oscillating charge
magnitudes. Specifically, two cases were considered. In the first case phase
delay between oscillations of the charge magnitudes was taken into account. In
the second case, opposite current wave travel direction was considered. These
results generalize the classical solution for electric dipole radiation, and
they show that under the above assumptions the electric dipole emits both
long-range longitudinal electric and transverse electromagnetic waves.
Longitudinal and transverse electric fields emitted by the electric dipole with
current wave traveling in both directions are displayed for specific values of
the dipole system parameters. It was shown that under the standard assumptions
that charge separation distance is much smaller than wavelength and non-zero
phase delay between charge oscillations: a) our solution reduces to classical
solution; b) transverse electromagnetic waves are dominant while longitudinal
electric waves are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to the
fourth degree of frequency and to the second degree of the charge separation
distance. In case wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance:
a) the classical solution is invalid and it overestimates the total radiated
power; b) longitudinal electric waves are dominant and transverse
electromagnetic waves are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional
to the third degree of frequency and to the charge separation distance. All
derived potential and force fields were summarized in the table.

transform is only defined for one fixed period, the inhomogeneous layer with
another period is simply treated as a non-periodic one. First, we approximate
the refractive index by a periodic one where its period is an integer multiple
of the fixed period, and it is decomposed by finite number of quasi-periodic

Using data from the Parkes radio telescope, we observe a smooth and fast

the pulsar rotational frequency of $\Delta\nu\approx-4\times10^{-4}$\,Hz.
During the transition, a net spin-down rate increase of
$\Delta\dot\nu\approx-1\times10^{-10}$\,Hz\,s$^{-1}$ is observed, followed by a
return of $\dot{\nu}$ to its original value. In addition, the radio pulsations
disappeared after the X-ray bursts and reappeared about two weeks later with
the flux density at 1.4\,GHz increased by a factor of five. The flux density
then decreased and undershot the normal flux density followed by a slow
recovery back to normal. The pulsar's integrated profile underwent dramatic and
short-term changes in total intensity, polarization and position angle. Despite
the complex evolution, we observe correlations between the spin-down rate,
pulse profile shape and radio flux density. Strong single pulses have been
detected after the X-ray bursts with their energy distributions evolving with
time. The peculiar but smooth spin frequency evolution of PSR~J1119$-$6127
accompanied by systematic pulse profile and flux density changes are most
likely to be a result of either reconfiguration of the surface magnetic fields
or particle winds triggered by the X-ray bursts. The recovery of spin-down rate
and pulse profile to normal provides us the best case to study the connection

in the application of separating hazardous chlorinated solvents from other
materials, based on their Raman spectra. The experimentation is carried out
using a new one-sided classification toolkit that was designed and developed
from the ground up. In the one-sided classification paradigm, the objective is
to separate elements of the target class from all outliers. These one-sided
classifiers are generally chosen, in practice, when there is a deficiency of
some sort in the training examples. Sometimes outlier examples can be rare,
expensive to label, or even entirely absent. However, this author would like to
note that they can be equally applicable when outlier examples are plentiful
but nonetheless not statistically representative of the complete outlier
concept. It is this scenario that is explicitly dealt with in this research
work. In these circumstances, one-sided classifiers have been found to be more
robust that conventional multi-class classifiers. The term ""unexpected""
outliers is introduced to represent outlier examples, encountered in the test
set, that have been taken from a different distribution to the training set
examples. These are examples that are a result of an inadequate representation
of all possible outliers in the training set. It can often be impossible to
fully characterise outlier examples given the fact that they can represent the
immeasurable quantity of ""everything else"" that is not a target. The findings
from this research have shown the potential drawbacks of using conventional
multi-class classification algorithms when the test data come from a completely
different distribution to that of the training samples.

clinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow
automation. Existing deep network models require a large amount of labeled
data. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labeling in X-ray images relies
heavily on skilled clinicians due to the large overlaps of anatomy and the
complex texture patterns. On the other hand, organs in 3D CT scans preserve
clearer structures as well as sharper boundaries and thus can be easily
delineated. In this paper, we propose a novel model framework for learning
automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled CT scans. Specifically, a Dense
Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on
X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT
volumes. Then we introduce a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network
(TD-GAN) architecture to achieve simultaneous style transfer and parsing for
unseen real X-ray images. TD-GAN consists of a modified cycle-GAN substructure
for pixel-to-pixel translation between DRRs and X-ray images and an added
module leveraging the pre-trained DI2I to enforce segmentation consistency. The
TD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks.
In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and
153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely
on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram
labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves
the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%).

three classes of its solutions as series of square integrable functions written

satisfy three-term recursion relations, which are solved in terms of orthogonal
polynomials with continuous and/or discrete spectra. Some of these are
well-known polynomials while others are either new or modified versions of
known ones.

generated an unprecedentedly high workload to scientific communities.
Consequently, review quality has been decreasing and review outcomes have
become less correlated with the real merits of the papers and proposals. A
novel distributed peer review (DPR) approach has recently been proposed to
address these issues. The new approach assigns principal investigators (PIs)
who submitted proposals (or papers) to the same program as reviewers. Each PI
reviews and ranks a small number (such as seven) of other PIs' proposals. The
individual rankings are then used to estimate a global ranking of all proposals
using the Modified Borda Count (MBC). In this study, we perform simulation
studies to investigate several parameters important for the decision making
when adopting this new approach. We also propose a new method called
Concordance Index-based Global Ranking (CIGR) to estimate global ranking from
individual rankings. An efficient simulated annealing algorithm is designed to
search the optimal Concordance Index (CI). Moreover, we design a new balanced
review assignment procedure, which can result in significantly better
performance for both MBC and CIGR methods. We found that CIGR performs better
than MBC when the review quality is relatively high. As review quality and
review difficulty are tightly correlated, we constructed a boundary in the
space of review quality vs review difficulty that separates the CIGR-superior
and MBC-superior regions. Finally, we propose a multi-stage DPR strategy based
on CIGR, which has the potential to substantially improve the overall review
performance while reducing the review workload.

and subsequent notational variants, a metalanguage involving formal ""grammars""
has developed for discussing structured objects in Computer Science and
Mathematical Logic. We refer to this offspring of BNF as Math-BNF or MBNF, to
the original BNF and its notational variants just as BNF, and to aspects common
to both as BNF-style. What all BNF-style notations share is the use of
production rules roughly of this form: $$\bullet \mathrel{::=} \circ_1 \mid
\cdots \mid \circ_n $$ Normally, such a rule says ""every instance of $\circ_i$
for $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is also an in stance of $\bullet$"". MBNF is
distinct from BNF in the entities and operations it allows. Instead of strings,
MBNF builds arrangements of symbols that we call math-text. Sometimes ""syntax""
is defined by interleaving MBNF production rules and other mathematical
definitions that can contain chunks of math-text. There is no clear definition
of MBNF. Readers do not have a document which tells them how MBNF is to be read
and must learn MBNF through a process of cultural initiation. To the extent
that MBNF is defined, it is largely through examples scattered throughout the
literature and which require readers to guess the mathematical structures
underpinning them. This paper gives MBNF examples illustrating some of the
differences between MBNF and BNF. We propose a definition of syntactic math
text (SMT) which handles many (but far from all) uses of math-text and MBNF in
the wild. We aim to balance the goal of being accessible and not requiring too
much prerequisite knowledge with the conflicting goal of providing a rich
mathematical structure that already supports many uses and has possibilities to
be extended to support more challenging cases.

  formulations",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel method was developed for the sampling of volatiles produces by
polymer decomposition during UL94 standard flammability tests, allowing to
collect, separate and analyze the precise composition of the fuel mixture
feeding the flame in the real flammability tests. The system was validated on
epoxy resin/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes and found extremely
informative for the understanding of the flame retardancy mechanisms of POSS,
previously referred to as the blowing-out effect. Collected products were
analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, to
identify the gaseous and liquid decomposition products, allowing to depict a
comprehensive decomposition pathway for the epoxy resin. Lightweight volatiles,
gaseous at room temperature, showed limited differences as a function of
DOPO-POSS, whereas mixtures of liquid products evidenced for dramatic changes
in the relative concentration as a function of DOPO-POSS. In pristine epoxy
resin, the most abundant products were recognized as benzene, phenol,
naphthalene and toluene, along with several tens of other aromatic products
observed in lower amounts. The presence of DOPO-POSS at low concentration
radically changes the composition of the aromatic volatiles mixture, as no
significant amount of benzene is produced, while phenol becomes the main
product, accounting for about half of the total, isopropyl phenol and bisphenol
A, along with several tens of other products in lower concentrations. Such
modification of the fuel mixture feeding the flame provided an explanation for
the lower flammability of this formulation, as well as for the phenomenology of
the blowing out effect.

Especially, the convolutional neural network (CNN), one representative model of
deep learning, achieves great successes in computer vision and natural language
processing. However, simply or blindly applying CNN to the other fields results
in lower training effects or makes it quite difficult to adjust the model
parameters. In this poster, we propose a general methodology named V-CNN by
introducing data visualizing for CNN. V-CNN introduces a data visualization
model prior to CNN modeling to make sure the data after processing is fit for
the features of images as well as CNN modeling. We apply V-CNN to the network
intrusion detection problem based on a famous practical dataset: AWID.
Simulation results confirm V-CNN significantly outperforms other studies and
the recall rate of each invasion category is more than 99.8%.

running code. However, computing platforms, where the actual hardware
characteristics are hidden from both the end user and the tools that mediate
execution, such as a compiler, a JIT and a runtime system, are used more and
more, for example, performing large scale computation in cloud and cluster.
Even worse, in such environments, a single computation may use a collection of
processors with dissimilar characteristics. Ignorance of the
performance-critical parameters of the underlying system makes it difficult to
improve performance by optimizing the code or adjusting runtime-system
behaviors; it also makes application performance harder to understand.
  To address this problem, we have developed a suite of portable tools that can
efficiently derive many of the parameters of processor memory hierarchies, such
as levels, effective capacity and latency of caches and TLBs, in a matter of
seconds. The tools use a series of carefully considered experiments to produce
and analyze cache response curves automatically. The tools are inexpensive
enough to be used in a variety of contexts that may include install time,
compile time or runtime adaption, or performance understanding tools.

  Immutability",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Supply Chain monitoring applications rely on
messaging protocols for exchanging data. Contemporary IoT deployments widely
use the publish-subscribe messaging model because of its resource-efficiency.
However, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a
centralized architecture, wherein the data from all the devices in the
application network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a
centralized architecture make publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to
a central point of failure. Besides, it provides an opportunity for the
organization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we
contribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with
blockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of
the brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network. The distributed
data is stored in an immutable ledger through the use of the blockchain
technology. Furthermore, Trinity executes smart contracts to validate the data
before saving the data on the blockchain. Through the use of a blockchain
network, Trinity can guarantee persistence, ordering, and immutability across
trust boundaries. Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal
resources, and the use of smart contracts enable the stakeholders to automate
the data management processes. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the
first framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with
the publish-subscribe messaging model.

certain size. At IAU resolution B5, item b, that shape serves as an indicator
for a distinct mechanism of its forming, caused by a minimum of mass. Rigid
body forces should have been overcome by self gravity and a hydrostatic
equilibrium shape should have been achieved. A new approach to correlate the
size and shape of a solid in hydrostatic equilibrium by balancing self gravity
and rigid body forces leads to a real, not to an arbitrary lower limit of size.
No arbitrary criterion is required as it is often the case. Above this limit
the shape of a solid body is restricted by a maximum of its surface area, and
this maximum vanishes only at infinite size. Therefore the shape like that of a
related fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium can only be reached in the solid
state, if its surface area is larger than this maximum. This applies only to
the four giant planets and Haumea. All the known nearly round celestial bodies
in the solar System cant have achieved their present shape while being solids.
The dwarf Haumea is a questionable exception. The present shapes have been
formed before solidification and are frozen. The gas giants are not solids at
all and the terrestrial planets have at least partially melted in their thermal
history for millions of years. The smaller nearly round objects such as
asteroids and satellites were at least partially melted combined with internal
differentiation and resurfacing of a mechanically unstable crust in their very
early thermal history. No rigid body forces had to be overcome. Item b of the
current planet definition is somewhat undetermined. All planets and dwarfs in
the solar system match this requirement only at very generous interpretation.
It should be completely deleted. The number of dwarfs could be restricted by an
arbitrary minimum of mass.
