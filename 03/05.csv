  Massive MIMO Systems","Accepted, IEEE Communications Letters 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this letter, we introduce a novel pilot design approach that minimizes the
total mean square errors of the minimum mean square error estimators of all
base stations (BSs) subject to the transmit power constraints of individual
users in the network, while tackling the pilot contamination in multi-cell
Massive MIMO systems. First, we decompose the original non-convex problem into
distributed optimization sub-problems at individual BSs, where each BS can
optimize its own pilot signals given the knowledge of pilot signals from the
remaining BSs. We then introduce a successive optimization approach to
transform each optimization sub-problem into a linear matrix inequality (LMI)
form, which is convex and can be solved by available optimization packages.
Simulation results confirm the fast convergence of the proposed approach and
prevails a benchmark scheme in terms of providing higher accuracy.

coefficient inverse problem: how to reconstruct the spatially distributed
refractive index of scatterers from the intensity (modulus square) of the full
complex valued wave field at an array of light detectors located on a
measurement board. The propagation of the wave field is governed by the 3D
Helmholtz equation. Our method consists of two stages. On the first stage, we
use asymptotic analysis to obtain an upper estimate for the modulus of the
scattered wave field. This estimate allows us to approximately reconstruct the
wave field at the measurement board using an inversion formula. This reduces
the phaseless inverse scattering problem to the phased one. At the second
stage, we apply a recently developed globally convergent numerical method to
reconstruct the desired refractive index from the total wave obtained at the
first stage. Unlike the optimization approach, the two-stage method described
above is global in the sense that it does not require a good initial guess of
the true solution. We test our numerical method on both computationally
simulated and experimental data. Although experimental data are noisy, our
method produces quite accurate numerical results.

$w_1, w_2, \ldots$ such that for any sequence $s_1, s_2, \ldots\in S$, the
equations $w_n = s_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, can be solved simultaneously in $S$.
For example, Galvin showed that the sequence
$(a^{-1}(a^nba^{-n})b^{-1}(a^nb^{-1}a^{-n})ba)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is universal
for the symmetric group Sym$(X)$ when $X$ is infinite, and Sierpi\'nski showed
that $(a ^ 2 b ^ 3 (abab ^ 3) ^ {n + 1} ab ^ 2 ab ^ 3)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is
universal for the monoid $X ^ X$ of functions from the infinite set $X$ to
itself.
  In this paper, we show that under some conditions, the set of universal
sequences for the symmetric group on an infinite set $X$ is independent of the
cardinality of $X$. More precisely, we show that if $Y$ is any set such that
$|Y| \geq |X|$, then every universal sequence for Sym$(X)$ is also universal
for Sym$(Y)$. If $|X| > 2 ^ {\aleph_0}$, then the converse also holds. It is
shown that an analogue of this theorem holds in the context of inverse
semigroups, where the role of the symmetric group is played by the symmetric
inverse monoid. In the general context of semigroups, the full transformation
monoid $X ^ X$ is the natural analogue of the symmetric group and the symmetric
inverse monoid. If $X$ and $Y$ are arbitrary infinite sets, then it is an open
question as to whether or not every sequence that is universal for $X ^ X$ is
also universal for $Y ^ Y$. However, we obtain a sufficient condition for a
sequence to be universal for $X ^ X$ which does not depend on the cardinality
of $X$. A large class of sequences satisfy this condition, and hence are
universal for $X ^ X$ for every infinite set $X$.

estimates for safe, effective navigation and decision-making. Although many

Thus, AVs must be able to handle situations in which the topology specified by
the map does not agree with reality. We present the Variable Structure Multiple
Hidden Markov Model (VSM-HMM) as a framework for localizing in the presence of
topological uncertainty, and demonstrate its effectiveness on an AV where lane
membership is modeled as a topological localization process. VSM-HMMs use a
dynamic set of HMMs to simultaneously reason about location within a set of
most likely current topologies and therefore may also be applied to topological
structure estimation as well as AV lane estimation. In addition, we present an
extension to the Earth Mover's Distance which allows uncertainty to be taken
into account when computing the distance between belief distributions on

Neuronal tracing studies show that long-ranged excitatory connections form

excitation by allowing coupling types to spatially oscillate between excitation
and inhibition. In turn, we hope to analyze traveling fronts and pulses with
novel shapes. With fronts as our main focus, we exploit Heaviside firing rate
functions in order to establish existence and utilize speed index functions
with at most one critical point as a tool for showing uniqueness of wave speed.
We are able to construct Evans functions, the so-called stability index
functions, in order to provide positive spectral stability results. Finally, we
show that by incorporating slow linear feedback, we can compute fast pulses

presence of these defects in LaAlO3 slab can suppress the surface conductivity.
In contrast, in insulating SrTiO3 slabs already very small concentrations of
oxygen vacancies or hydrogen dopant atoms induce a finite occupation of the
conduction band. Surface defects in insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure
slabs with three LaAlO3 overlayers lead to the emergence of interface
conductivity. Calculated defect formation energies reveal strong preference of
hydrogen dopant atoms for surface sites for all structures and concentrations
considered. Strong decrease of the defect formation energy of hydrogen adatoms
with increasing thickness of the LaAlO3 overlayer and crossover from positive
to negative values, taken together with the metallic conductivity induced by
hydrogen adatoms, seamlessly explains the semiconductor-metal transition
observed for these heterostructures as a function of the overlayer thickness.
Moreover, we show that the potential drop and concomitant shift of (layer
resolved) band edges is suppressed for the metallic configuration. Finally,
magnetism with stable local moments, which form atomically thin magnetic layers
at the interface, is generated by oxygen vacancies either at the surface or the
interface, or by hydrogen atoms buried at the interface. In particular, oxygen
vacancies in the TiO2 interface layer cause drastic downshift of the 3d e_g
states of the Ti atoms neighboring the vacancies, giving rise to strongly

magnetization.

systems modelled by nonlinear difference equations with inputs and define
concrete robust abstractions for them. While most abstraction techniques in the
literature for nonlinear systems focus on constructing sound abstractions, we
present computational procedures for constructing both sound and approximately
complete robust abstractions for general nonlinear control systems without
stability assumptions. Such procedures are approximately complete in the sense
that, given a concrete discrete-time control system and an arbitrarily small
perturbation of this system, there exists a finite transition system that
robustly abstracts the concrete system and is abstracted by the slightly
perturbed system simultaneously. A direct consequence of this result is that
robust control synthesis for discrete-time nonlinear systems and linear-time
specifications is robustly decidable. More specifically, if there exists a
robust control strategy that realizes a given linear-time specification, we can
algorithmically construct a (potentially less) robust control strategy that
realizes the same specification. The theoretical results are illustrated with a
simple motion planning example.

putting forward arguments, based on a post-Newtonian approximative calculation,
that there can be a sizable general relativistic (GR) correction in the
experimental determination of the muon magnetic moment based on spin
precession, i.e., in muon g-2 experiments. In response, other authors argued
that the effect must be much smaller than claimed. Further authors argued that
the effect exactly cancels. Also, the known formulae for de Sitter and
Lense-Thirring effect do not apply due to the non-geodesic motion. All this
indicates that it is difficult to estimate from first principles the influence
of GR corrections in the problem of spin propagation. Therefore, in this paper
we present a full general relativistic calculation in order to quantify this
effect. The main methodology is the purely differential geometrical tool of
Fermi-Walker transport over a Schwarzschild background. Also the Larmor
precession due to the propagation in the electromagnetic field of the
experimental apparatus is included. For the muon g-2 experiments the GR
correction turns out to be very small, well below the present sensitivity.
However, in other similar storage ring experimental settings, such as electric
dipole moment (EDM) search experiments, where the so-called frozen spin method
is used, GR gives a well detectable effect, and should be corrected for. All
frozen spin scenarios are affected which intend to reach a sensitivity of 0.1
microradians/second for the spin precession in the vertical plane.

using the partial gradients of the coupling function that can be viewed as a
generalization of the method proposed by Chambolle and Pock in 2016 to solve
saddle point problems defined by a convex-concave function $\mathcal
L(x,y)=f(x)+\Phi(x,y)-h(y)$ with a general coupling term $\Phi(x,y)$ that is
not assumed to be bilinear. Assuming $\nabla_x\Phi(\cdot,y)$ is Lipschitz for
any fixed $y$, and $\nabla_y\Phi(\cdot,\cdot)$ is Lipschitz, we show that the
iterate sequence converges to a saddle point; and for any $(x,y)$, we derive
error bounds in terms of $\mathcal L(\bar{x}_k,y)-\mathcal L(x,\bar{y}_k)$ for
the ergodic sequence $\{\bar{x}_k,\bar{y}_k\}$. In particular, we show
$\mathcal O(1/k)$ rate when the problem is merely convex in $x$. Furthermore,
assuming $\Phi(x,\cdot)$ is linear for each fixed $x$ and $f$ is strongly
convex, we obtain the ergodic convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/k^2)$ -- we are
not aware of another single-loop method in the related literature achieving the
same rate when $\Phi$ is not bilinear. Finally, we propose a backtracking
technique which does not require the knowledge of Lipschitz constants while
ensuring the same convergence results. We also consider convex optimization
problems with nonlinear functional constraints and we show that using the
backtracking scheme, the optimal convergence rate can be achieved even when the
dual domain is unbounded. We tested our method against other state-of-the-art
first-order algorithms and interior-point methods for solving quadratically
constrained quadratic problems with synthetic data, the kernel matrix learning,

essentially same as varying-coefficient model. In the former research about
varying-coefficient model, scholars tend to use multidimensional-kernel-based
locally weighted estimation(MLWE) so that information of both distance and
direction is considered. However, when we construct the local weight matrix of
geographically weighted estimation, distance among the locations in the
neighbor is the only factor controlling the value of entries of weight matrix.
In other word, estimation of GWR is distance-kernel-based. Thus, in this paper,
under stationary and limited dependent data with multidimensional subscripts,
we analyze the local mean squared properties of without any assumption of the
form of coefficient functions and compare it with MLWE. According to the
theoretical and simulation results, geographically-weighted locally linear
estimation(GWLE) is asymptotically more efficient than MLWE. Furthermore, a
relationship between optimal bandwith selection and design of scale parameters
is also obtained.

trajectory, which encodes a player's 3D location and 3D head orientation
throughout the sequence. To do this, we first introduce a future convolutional
neural network (CNN) that predicts an initial sequence of 12D camera
configurations, aiming to capture how real players move during a one-on-one
basketball game. We also introduce a goal verifier network, which is trained to
verify that a given camera configuration is consistent with the final goals of
real one-on-one basketball players. Next, we propose an inverse synthesis
procedure to synthesize a refined sequence of 12D camera configurations that
(1) sufficiently matches the initial configurations predicted by the future
CNN, while (2) maximizing the output of the goal verifier network. Finally, by
following the trajectory resulting from the refined camera configuration
sequence, we obtain the complete 12D motion sequence.
  Our model generates realistic basketball motion sequences that capture the
goals of real players, outperforming standard deep learning approaches such as
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and
generative adversarial networks (GANs).

use a machine learning technique to establish a connection between local

glassy materials, we define a purely structural quantity, softness, that
captures the propensity of an atom to rearrange. This approach correctly
identifies crystalline regions, stacking faults, and twin boundaries as having
low likelihood of atomic rearrangements, while finding a large variability
within high-energy grain boundaries. As has been found in glasses [9,19,26],
the probability that atoms of a given softness will rearrange is nearly
Arrhenius. This indicates a well-defined energy barrier as well as a
well-defined prefactor for the Arrhenius form for atoms of a given softness.
The decrease in the prefactor for low-softness atoms indicates that variations

(XDFT) a computationally light, generally applicable, first-principles
technique for calculating neutral excitations based on generalized constrained
DFT. In order to simulate an M-particle excited state of an N-electron system,
XDFT automatically optimizes a constraining potential to confine N-M electrons
within the ground-state Kohn-Sham valence subspace. We demonstrate the efficacy
of XDFT by calculating the lowest single-particle singlet and triplet
excitation energies of the well-known Thiel molecular test set, with results
which are in excellent agreement with time-dependent DFT. Furthermore, going
beyond the capability of adiabatic time-dependent DFT, we show that XDFT can
successfully capture double excitations. Overall our method makes optical gaps,
excition bindings and oscillator strengths readily accessible at a
computational cost comparable to that of standard DFT. As such, XDFT appears as
an ideal candidate to work within high-throughput discovery frameworks and
within linear-scaling methods for large systems.

marginal role in contemporary research on discrete black-box optimization. This
has led to the unsatisfactory situation in which feedback-free parameter
selection rules such as the cooling schedule of Simulated Annealing are
predominant in state-of-the-art heuristics, while, at the same time, we
understand very well that such time-dependent selection rules can only perform
worse than adjustment rules that do take into account the evolution of the
optimization process. A number of adaptive and self-adaptive parameter control
strategies have been proposed in the literature, but did not (yet) make their
way to a broader public. A key obstacle seems to lie in their rather complex
update rules.
  The purpose of our work is to demonstrate that high-performing online
parameter selection rules do not have to be very complicated. More precisely,
we experiment with a multiplicative, comparison-based update rule to adjust the
mutation probability of a (1+1)~Evolutionary Algorithm. We show that this
simple self-adjusting rule outperforms the best static unary unbiased black-box
algorithm on LeadingOnes, achieving an almost optimal speedup of about~$18\%$.

significant outcome of this study is that the nano-sized fraction represents
26% by mass of the initial BWP. Human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3) are

exhibit probabilistic switching between two stable states to achieve stochastic

this value directly benefits the recommendation and ad pacing contexts in music

physically self-consistent models is a central problem for galaxy evolution.
Although numerous theoretical models have been proposed in recent decades, the
debate still exists. By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe
feedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the
evolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback
models are updated based on \citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively
from the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find
that SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low
mass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass
galaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus
regulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is
extremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot
account for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies. The X-ray
temperature $T_{\rm X}$ and luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ of hot plasma can be in
agreement with the observed data with the inclusion of effective feedback
processes. These results thus suggest that we can use $T_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm
X}$ to probe the role of different feedback processes. The inclusion of
additional gas sources can make the mass scale between SNe and AGN feedback
dominating in suppressing star formation decrease to an observationally
inferred value of a few $10^{10}~M_{\odot}$.

nulls}, that is, values representing {\em all} possible objects, have received
almost no attention. We remedy the situation in this paper, by showing that a
suitable finite representation mechanism, called {\em Star Cylinders}, handling
universal nulls can be developed based on the {\em Cylindric Set Algebra} of
Henkin, Monk and Tarski. We provide a finitary version of the cylindric set
algebra, called {\em Cylindric Star Algebra}, and show that our star-cylinders
are closed under this algebra. Moreover, we show that any {\em First Order
Relational Calculus} query over databases containing universal nulls can be
translated into an equivalent expression in our cylindric star-algebra, and
vice versa, in time polynomial in the size of the database.
  The representation mechanism is then extended to {\em Naive Star Cylinders},
which are star-cylinders allowing existential nulls in addition to universal
nulls. For positive queries (with universal quantification), the well known
naive evaluation technique can still be applied on the existential nulls,
thereby allowing polynomial time evaluation of certain answers on databases
containing both universal and existential nulls. If precise answers are
required, certain answer evaluation with universal and existential nulls
remains in coNP. Note that the problem is coNP-hard, already for positive
existential queries and databases with only existential nulls. If inequalities
$\neg(x_i\approx x_j)$ are allowed, reasoning over existential databases is
known to be $\Pi^p_2$-complete, and it remains in $\Pi^p_2$ when universal

framework at the community level for recovery management. The proposed
mathematical approach leverages approximate dynamic programming along with
heuristics for the determination of recovery actions. Our methodology overcomes
the curse of dimensionality and manages multi-state, large-scale infrastructure
systems following disasters. We also provide computational results showing that
our methodology not only incorporates recovery policies of responsible public
and private entities within the community but also substantially enhances the
performance of their underlying strategies with limited resources. The
methodology can be implemented efficiently to identify near-optimal recovery
decisions following a severe earthquake based on multiple objectives for an
electrical power network of a testbed community coarsely modeled after Gilroy,
California, United States. The proposed optimization method supports
risk-informed community decision makers within chaotic post-hazard
circumstances.

to sparse statistical learning and has attracted significant attention across

work has shown that modern mixed integer optimization (MIO) solvers can be used
to address small to moderate instances of this problem. In spite of the
usefulness of $L_0$-based estimators and generic MIO solvers, there is a steep
computational price to pay when compared to popular sparse learning algorithms
(e.g., based on $L_1$ regularization). In this paper, we aim to push the
frontiers of computation for a family of $L_0$-regularized problems with
additional convex penalties. We propose a new hierarchy of necessary optimality
conditions for these problems. We develop fast algorithms, based on coordinate
descent and local combinatorial optimization, that are guaranteed to converge
to solutions satisfying these optimality conditions. From a statistical
viewpoint, an interesting story emerges. When the signal strength is high, our
combinatorial optimization algorithms have an edge in challenging statistical
settings. When the signal is lower, pure $L_0$ benefits from additional convex
regularization. We empirically demonstrate that our family of $L_0$-based
estimators can outperform the state-of-the-art sparse learning algorithms in

metrics under various regimes (e.g., different signal strengths, feature
correlations, number of samples and features). Our new open-source sparse

Mathematics in general, and geometry in particular, provide interesting
challenges when developing educative softwares, both in the education and
computer science aspects. QED-Tutrix is an intelligent tutor for geometry
offering an interface to help high school students in the resolution of
demonstration problems. It focuses on specific goals: 1) to allow the student
to freely explore the problem and its figure, 2) to accept proofs elements in
any order, 3) to handle a variety of proofs, which can be customized by the
teacher, and 4) to be able to help the student at any step of the resolution of
the problem, if the need arises. The software is also independent from the
intervention of the teacher. QED-Tutrix offers an interesting approach to
geometry education, but is currently crippled by the lengthiness of the process
of implementing new problems, a task that must still be done manually.
Therefore, one of the main focuses of the QED-Tutrix' research team is to ease
the implementation of new problems, by automating the tedious step of finding
all possible proofs for a given problem. This automation must follow
fundamental constraints in order to create problems compatible with QED-Tutrix:
1) readability of the proofs, 2) accessibility at a high school level, and 3)
possibility for the teacher to modify the parameters defining the
""acceptability"" of a proof. We present in this paper the result of our
preliminary exploration of possible avenues for this task. Automated theorem
proving in geometry is a widely studied subject, and various provers exist.
However, our constraints are quite specific and some adaptation would be
required to use an existing prover. We have therefore implemented a prototype
of automated prover to suit our needs. The future goal is to compare
performances and usability in our specific use-case between the existing
provers and our implementation.

  Such information exchange between clients (e.g. WGL) and servers (e.g. TGTP)
raises many issues: geometric search - someone, working in a geometric problem,
must be able to ask for more information regarding that construction; levels of
geometric knowledge and interest - the problems in the servers must be
classified in such a way that, in response to a client query, only the problems
in the user's level and/or interest are returned; different aims of each tool -
e.g. WGL is about secondary school geometry, TGTP is about formal proofs in
semi-analytic and algebraic proof methods, not a perfect match indeed;
localisation issues, e.g. a Portuguese user obliged to make the query and
process the answer in English; technical issues-many technical issues need to
be addressed to make this exchange of geometric information possible and
useful.
  Instead of a giant (difficult to maintain) tool, trying to cover all, the
interconnection of specialised tools seems much more promising. The challenges
to make that connection work are many and difficult, but, it is the authors
impression, not insurmountable.

generalization of stable matchings in the marriage setting, and they are
especially relevant when preference lists are incomplete. In this case, the
cardinality of a stable matching can be as small as half the size of a maximum
matching. Popular matchings allow for assignments of larger size while still
guaranteeing a certain fairness condition. In fact, stable matchings are
popular matchings of minimum size, and a maximum size popular matching can be
as large as twice the size of a(ny) stable matching in a given instance. The
structure of popular matchings seems to be more complex, and currently less
understood, than that of stable matchings. In this paper, we focus on three
optimization problems related to popular matchings. First, we give a granular
analysis of the complexity of popular matching with forbidden and forced
elements problems, thus complementing results from [Cseh and Kavitha, 2016]. In
particular, we show that deciding whether there exists a popular matching with
(or without) two given edges is NP-Hard. This implies that finding a popular
matching of maximum (resp. minimum) weight is NP-Hard and, even if all weights
are nonnegative, inapproximable up to a factor 1/2 (resp. up to any factor). A
decomposition theorem from [Cseh and Kavitha, 2016] can be employed to give a
1/2 approximation to the maximum weighted popular matching problem with
nonnegative weights, thus completely settling the complexity of those problems.

argue that a general mechanism of the Tc enhancement in all known high-Tc

architecture that brings insights from predictive state representations to
reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Predictive state
policy networks consist of a recursive filter, which keeps track of a belief
about the state of the environment, and a reactive policy that directly maps
beliefs to actions, to maximize the cumulative reward. The recursive filter
leverages predictive state representations (PSRs) (Rosencrantz and Gordon,
2004; Sun et al., 2016) by modeling predictive state-- a prediction of the
distribution of future observations conditioned on history and future actions.
This representation gives rise to a rich class of statistically consistent
algorithms (Hefny et al., 2018) to initialize the recursive filter. Predictive
state serves as an equivalent representation of a belief state. Therefore, the
policy component of the RPSP-network can be purely reactive, simplifying
training while still allowing optimal behaviour. Moreover, we use the PSR
interpretation during training as well, by incorporating prediction error in
the loss function. The entire network (recursive filter and reactive policy) is
still differentiable and can be trained using gradient based methods. We
optimize our policy using a combination of policy gradient based on rewards
(Williams, 1992) and gradient descent based on prediction error. We show the
efficacy of RPSP-networks under partial observability on a set of robotic
control tasks from OpenAI Gym. We empirically show that RPSP-networks perform
well compared with memory-preserving networks such as GRUs, as well as finite
memory models, being the overall best performing method.

consequently at a critical thickness a crossover from a 3D-TI to a 2D insulator
occurs. Although such a crossover is generally accessible by scanning tunneling
microscopy, or by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, such measurements
require clean surfaces. Here, we demonstrate that a cascading nonlinear
magneto-optical effect induced via strong spin-orbit coupling can examine such
crossovers. The helicity dependence of the time-resolved Kerr rotation exhibits
a robust change in periodicity at a critical thickness, from which it is
possible to predict the formation of a Dirac cone in a film several quintuple

fundamental nonlinear optical effect that can be applied to a wide range of TIs

electronic excited states of these defects, including charge transition levels
corresponding to the addition of one or more electrons to the defect. Our main
theoretical result concerns the GeV complex, which we show to give rise to two
excited states deep in the gap, at -0.51 and -0.35 eV from the conduction band,
consistently with the available spectroscopic data. The adopted theoretical
scheme, suitable to compute a reliable estimate of the wavefunction decay,
leads us to predict that such states are associated to an electron localization
over a length of about 0.45 nm. By combining the electronic properties of the
bare silicon vacancy, carrying deep states in the band gap, with the spatial
controllability arising from single Ge ion implantation techniques, the GeVn
complex emerges as a suitable ingredient for silicon-based room-temperature
single-atom devices.

been extensively studied in literature. However, only very limited preliminary
studies tackled the challenges in handling highly dynamic changes in real
networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of tracking top-$k$ influential
vertices in dynamic networks, where the dynamic changes are modeled as a stream
of edge weight updates. Under the popularly adopted linear threshold (LT) model
and the independent cascade (IC) model, we address two essential versions of
the problem: tracking the top-$k$ influential individuals and finding the best
$k$-seed set to maximize the influence spread (Influence Maximization). We
adopt the polling-based method and maintain a sample of random RR sets so that
we can approximate the influence of vertices with provable quality guarantees.
It is known that updating RR sets over dynamic changes of a network can be
easily done by a reservoir sampling method, so the key challenge is to
efficiently decide how many RR sets are needed to achieve good quality
guarantees. We use two simple signals, which both can be accessed in $O(1)$
time, to decide a proper number of RR sets. We prove the effectiveness of our
methods. For both tasks the error incurred in our method is only a
multiplicative factor to the ground truth. For influence maximization, we also
propose an efficient query algorithm for finding the $k$ seeds, which is one
order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art query algorithm in
practice. In addition to the thorough theoretical results, our experimental
results on large real networks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and

correctly handle the structural discontinuity between disparate classes in a

samples by generators, incurring instability during adversarial training. We
argue that these two infamous problems of unsupervised GAN training can be
largely alleviated by a learnable memory network to which both generators and
discriminators can access. Generators can effectively learn representation of
training samples to understand underlying cluster distributions of data, which
ease the structure discontinuity problem. At the same time, discriminators can
better memorize clusters of previously generated samples, which mitigate the
forgetting problem. We propose a novel end-to-end GAN model named memoryGAN,

population, along with their physical properties (ages, masses, extinction
values). We also determined the integrated ring properties, including the
average age, total stellar mass, and current star-formation rate (SFR). We find
that Sb-type galaxies tend to have the highest ring stellar mass fraction with
respect to the host galaxy, and this parameter is correlated with the ring's
SFR surface density. The ring SFRs are correlated with their stellar masses,
which is reminiscent of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. There are
striking correlations between star-forming properties (i.e., SFR and SFR
surface density) and non-axisymmetric bar parameters, appearing to confirm
previous inferences that strongly barred galaxies tend to have lower ring SFRs,
although the ring star-formation histories turn out to be significantly more
complicated. Nuclear rings with higher stellar masses tend to be associated
with lower cluster mass fractions, but there is no such relation with the ages
of the rings. The two youngest nuclear rings in our sample, NGC 1512 and NGC

to overcome convergence issues related to local optima by exploiting the
samples in a meaningful order (i.e. easy to hard), we introduce the cross-paced

self-paced learning methods which only consider a single modality and cannot
deal with prior knowledge, CPPCL is specifically designed to assess the
learning pace by jointly handling data from dual sources and modality-specific
prior information provided in the form of partial curricula. Additionally,
thanks to the learned dictionaries, we demonstrate that the proposed CPPCL
embeds robust coupled representations for SBIR. Our approach is extensively
evaluated on four publicly available datasets (i.e. CUFS, Flickr15K, QueenMary

surface features and can tremendously improve our understanding of the icy
tectonics. In addition, the GALA will infer the presence or absence of a
subsurface ocean by measuring the tidal and rotational responses. Furthermore,
it also improves the accuracy of gravity field measurements reflecting the
interior structure, collaborating with the radio science experiment. In
addition to range measurements, the signal strength and the waveform of the

also found that open-shell atoms such as C atom exhibit Mott gaps at the Fermi
level, which the exact density-functional theory (DFT) fails to describe. The
GFCCSD successfully reproduces the Mott HOMO-LUMO (highest-occupied molecular
orbital and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital) gaps even quantitatively. We
also discussed the origin of satellite peaks as shake-up effects by checking
the components of wave function of the satellite peaks. The GFCCSD is a novel
cutting edge to investigate the electronic states in detail.

multiple epochs from 2000 to 2015. NuSTAR detects the transmitted continua of
low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) in NGC 833 and NGC 835 with
line-of-sight column densities of $\approx 3 \times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $\approx 3\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The
iron-K$\alpha$ to hard X-ray luminosity ratios of NGC 833 and NGC 835 suggest
that their tori are moderately developed, which may have been triggered by the

both intrinsic luminosity (by a factor of 5) and absorption (by $\Delta N_{\rm

X-ray and total infrared luminosities in local LLAGNs hosted by spiral
galaxies. The large diversity in their ratios is consistent with the the

models. Many problems in vision are treated as assigning each pixel a label.
Disparities are labels for stereo. Such pixel-labeling problems are naturally
represented in terms of energy minimization, where the energy function has two
terms: one term penalizes solutions that inconsistent with the observed data,
the other term enforces spatial smoothness. Graph cuts are one of the effi-
cient methods for solving energy minimization. However, exact minimization of
multi labeling problems can be performed by graph cuts only for the case with
convex smoothness terms. In pixel-disparity formulation, convex smoothness
terms do not generate well reconstructed 3D results. Thus, truncated linear or
quadratic smoothness terms, etc. are used, where approximate energy
minimization is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a new site-labeling
formulation, where the sites are not pixels but lines in 3D space, labels are
not disparities but depth numbers. For this formulation, visibility reasoning
is naturally included in the energy function. In addition, this formulation
allows us to use a small smoothness term, which does not affect the 3D results
much. This makes the optimization step very simple, so we could develop an
approximation method for graph cut itself (not for energy minimization) and a
high performance GPU graph cut program. For Tsukuba stereo pair in Middlebury

The
seminal work of Ben-Or et al. (STOC 1988) shows that zero knowledge can be
achieved unconditionally for any language in NEXP, as long as one is willing to
make a suitable physical assumption: if the provers are spatially isolated,
then they can be assumed to be playing independent strategies. Quantum
mechanics, however, tells us that this assumption is unrealistic, because
spatially-isolated provers could share a quantum entangled state and realize a
non-local correlated strategy. The MIP* model captures this setting. In this
work we study the following question: does spatial isolation still suffice to
unconditionally achieve zero knowledge even in the presence of quantum
entanglement? We answer this question in the affirmative: we prove that every
language in NEXP has a 2-prover zero knowledge interactive proof that is sound
against entangled provers; that is, NEXP \subseteq ZK-MIP*. Our proof consists
of constructing a zero knowledge interactive PCP with a strong algebraic
structure, and then lifting it to the MIP* model. This lifting relies on a new
framework that builds on recent advances in low-degree testing against
entangled strategies, and clearly separates classical and quantum tools. Our
main technical contribution consists of developing new algebraic techniques for
obtaining unconditional zero knowledge; this includes a zero knowledge variant
of the celebrated sumcheck protocol, a key building block in many probabilistic
proof systems. A core component of our sumcheck protocol is a new algebraic
commitment scheme, whose analysis relies on algebraic complexity theory.

non-invasive fashion. Here we present a theory describing how noise
magnetometry with spin probes can directly address several questions that have
emerged in experimental studies of 1D systems, including those in topological

it is possible to measure locally and independently local charge and spin
correlations of 1D systems. Visualization of 1D edge states, as well as
sampling correlations with wavevector resolution can be achieved by tuning the
probe-to-sample distance. Furthermore, temperature-dependent measurements of
magnetic noise can clearly delineate the dominant scattering mechanism
(impurities vs. interactions) -- this is of particular relevance to quantum
spin Hall measurements where conductance quantization is not perfect. The
possibility to probe both charge and spin excitations in a wide range of length

quantization is complete and it cannot be recovered by traditional image
processing methods, but the modern data-driven machine learning approach offers
a much needed cure to the problem. In this work we propose a novel approach to
restore and enhance images acquired in low and uneven lighting. First, the ill
illumination is algorithmically compensated by emulating the effects of
artificial supplementary lighting. Then a DCNN trained using only synthetic

related to consumer behavior, which has a profound business impact on online
recommendation. Previous work performing on only one single target domain may
not fully characterize users' novelty-seeking trait well due to the data
scarcity and sparsity, leading to the poor recommendation performance. Along
this line, we proposed a new cross-domain novelty-seeking trait mining model
(CDNST for short) to improve the sequential recommendation performance by
transferring the knowledge from auxiliary source domain. We conduct systematic
experiments on three domain data sets crawled from Douban (www.douban.com) to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover, we analyze how
the temporal property of sequential data affects the performance of CDNST, and
conduct simulation experiments to validate our analysis.

Experts (PFE) problem and Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) problem. First,
we revisit the well-studied and practically motivated setting of PFE with
switching costs. Many algorithms are known to achieve the minimax optimal order
of $O(\sqrt{T \log n})$ in expectation for both regret and number of switches,
where $T$ is the number of iterations and $n$ the number of actions. However,
no high probability (h.p.) guarantees are known. Our main technical
contribution is the first algorithms which with h.p. achieve this optimal order
for both regret and switches. This settles an open problem of [Devroye et al.,
2015], and directly implies the first h.p. guarantees for several problems of
interest.
  Next, to investigate the value of switching actions at a more granular level,
we introduce the setting of switching budgets, in which algorithms are limited
to $S \leq T$ switches between actions. This entails a limited number of free
switches, in contrast to the unlimited number of expensive switches in the
switching cost setting. Using the above result and several reductions, we unify
previous work and completely characterize the complexity of this switching
budget setting up to small polylogarithmic factors: for both PFE and MAB, for
all switching budgets $S \leq T$, and for both expectation and h.p. guarantees.
For PFE, we show the optimal rate is $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T\log n})$ for $S =
\Omega(\sqrt{T\log n})$, and $\min(\tilde{\Theta}(\tfrac{T\log n}{S}), T)$ for
$S = O(\sqrt{T \log n})$. Interestingly, the bandit setting does not exhibit
such a phase transition; instead we show the minimax rate decays steadily as
$\min(\tilde{\Theta}(\tfrac{T\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{S}}), T)$ for all ranges of $S
\leq T$. These results recover and generalize the known minimax rates for the
(arbitrary) switching cost setting.

Leveraging history information to relocalize and correct drift has become a hot
topic. In this paper, we propose a monocular visual-inertial SLAM system, which
can relocalize camera and get the absolute pose in a previous-built map. Then
4-DOF pose graph optimization is performed to correct drifts and achieve global
consistent. The 4-DOF contains x, y, z, and yaw angle, which is the actual
drifted direction in the visual-inertial system. Furthermore, the proposed
system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. Current
map and previous map can be merged together by the global pose graph
optimization. We validate the accuracy of our system on public datasets and
compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the map

being equiv- alent to a fixed-point free formula. We give in this paper an
axiomatization of least and greatest fixed-points of formulas, and an algorithm
to compute a fixed-point free formula equivalent to a given $\mu$-formula. The
axiomatization of the greatest fixed-point is simple. The axiomatization of the
least fixed- point is more complex, in particular every monotone formula
converges to its least fixed-point by Kleene's iteration in a finite number of
steps, but there is no uniform upper bound on the number of iterations. We
extract, out of the algorithm, upper bounds for such n, depending on the size
of the formula. For some formulas, we show that these upper bounds are
polynomial and optimal.

much larger than the characteristic time of the loss of memory in the particle

signal, focusing on the profile and duration. It is found that the light curve,
especially the steep decay (SD) phase, can be very different by adopting
different viewing angle $\theta_{\rm view}$ on the jet shell. For an on-axis
jet with a power-law radiation spectrum, the observed flux in the SD is
proportional to $t_{\rm{obs}}^{-2-\beta}$ with $\beta$ being the spectral index
and $t_{\rm{obs}}$ being the observer time. Here, $t_{\rm{obs}}=0$ is set at
the observed time of the jet ejected from the central engine. The SD may become
steep by increasing $\theta_{\rm view}$. We also study the bolometric
luminosity $L$ from a jet shell with a non-power-law radiation spectrum. For an
on-axis jet, $L{\propto}t_{\rm{obs}}^{-3}$ is found in the SD. However, the SD
is steeper than $L{\propto}t_{\rm{obs}}^{-3}$ for the radiation from an
off-axis jet. The higher value of $\theta_{\rm view}$ is, the steeper of SD
would be. Then, we suggest that the SD phase can be used to discriminate an
off-axis jet from an on-axis jet. The reason for above behaviors is discussed.
In addition, we find that the duration of first electromagnetic pulse is close
to its peak time, especially for $\theta_{\rm{view}}\sim20^\circ$. This result
is consistent with that found in GW~170817/GRB~170817A. Thus, the jet
corresponding to the prompt emission of GRB~170817A should be immediately
ejected after the merger. Our results also reveal that the duration of the

uncertain spatially varying Young's modulus. The uncertainty is modelled with a
finite set of parameters with prescribed probability distribution. We introduce
a novel three-field mixed variational formulation of the PDE model and discuss
its approximation by stochastic Galerkin mixed finite element techniques.
First, we establish the well posedness of the proposed variational formulation
and the associated finite-dimensional approximation. Second, we focus on the
efficient solution of the associated large and indefinite linear system of
equations. A new preconditioner is introduced for use with the minimal residual
method (MINRES). Eigenvalue bounds for the preconditioned system are
established and shown to be independent of the discretisation parameters and
the Poisson ratio. The S-IFISS software used for computation is available
online.

technology into vastly diverse applications. As the size of devices approaches

example, the performance of an ultra-scaled transistor can be strongly
influenced by the local electric field and strain. Here we study the spectral
response of single erbium ions to applied electric field and strain in a
silicon ultra-scaled transistor. Stark shifts induced by both the overall
electric field and the local charge environment are observed. Further, changes
in strain smaller than $3\times 10^{-6}$ are detected, which is around two
orders of magnitude more sensitive than the standard techniques used in the
semiconductor industry. These results open new possibilities for
non-destructive 3D mapping of the local strain and electric field in the

decade kernel methods have played a dominant role in pairwise learning. They
still obtain a state-of-the-art predictive performance, but a theoretical
analysis of their behavior has been underexplored in the machine learning
literature.
  In this work we review and unify existing kernel-based algorithms that are
commonly used in different pairwise learning settings, ranging from matrix
filtering to zero-shot learning. To this end, we focus on closed-form efficient
instantiations of Kronecker kernel ridge regression. We show that independent
task kernel ridge regression, two-step kernel ridge regression and a linear
matrix filter arise naturally as a special case of Kronecker kernel ridge
regression, implying that all these methods implicitly minimize a squared loss.
In addition, we analyze universality, consistency and spectral filtering
properties. Our theoretical results provide valuable insights in assessing the
advantages and limitations of existing pairwise learning methods.

with repulsion. They appear in numerous contexts, from physics to graph theory,
and display appealing theoretical properties. On the more practical side of
things, since DPPs tend to select sets of points that are some distance apart
(repulsion), they have been advocated as a way of producing random subsets with
high diversity. DPPs come in two variants: fixed-size and varying-size. A
sample from a varying-size DPP is a subset of random cardinality, while in
fixed-size ""$k$-DPPs"" the cardinality is fixed. The latter makes more sense in
many applications, but unfortunately their computational properties are less
attractive, since, among other things, inclusion probabilities are harder to
compute. In this work we show that as the size of the ground set grows,
$k$-DPPs and DPPs become equivalent, meaning that their inclusion probabilities
converge. As a by-product, we obtain saddlepoint formulas for inclusion
probabilities in $k$-DPPs. These turn out to be extremely accurate, and suffer
less from numerical difficulties than exact methods do. Our results also
suggest that $k$-DPPs and DPPs also have equivalent maximum likelihood
estimators. Finally, we obtain results on asymptotic approximations of
elementary symmetric polynomials which may be of independent interest.

the feature point labels during network training. This is combined with a
recurrent neural network architecture designed to provide the final prediction

describe how to integrate them in both a particle filter tracker and an

one that predicts only points inside the image. We show that as the amount of
the object in view decreases, being able to predict outside the image bounds
adds robustness to the final pose estimation.

experiments at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), provides us an important signature of possible de-confinement transition
from hadronic phase to partonic phase. However, hadronization processes of
de-confined partons back into final hadrons are found to play a vital role in
the observed hadronic flow. In the present work, we use coalescence mechanism
also known as Recombination (ReCo) to combine quarks into hadrons. To get
there, we have used Boltzmann transport equation in relaxation time
approximation to transport the quarks into equilibration and finally to
freeze-out surface, before coalescence takes place. A Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast
Wave (BGBW) function is taken as an equilibrium function to get the final
distribution and a power-like function to describe the initial distributions of
partons produced in heavy-ion collisions. In the present work, we try to
estimate the elliptic flow of identified hadrons such as $\pi$, $K$, $p$ etc.,
produced in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the LHC for
different centralities. The elliptic flow ($v_2$) of identified hadrons seems
to be described quite well in the available $p_{\rm T}$ range. After the
evolution of quarks until freeze-out time, has been calculated using BTE-RTA,
the approach used in this paper consists of combining two or more quarks to
explain the produced hadrons at intermediate momenta regions. The formalism is
found to describe elliptic flow of hadrons produced in Pb+Pb collisions to a
large extent.

the discovery of the INTEGRAL transient IGR J17329-2731. The optical data
collected with the SOAR telescope allowed us to identify the donor star in this
system as a late M giant at a distance of 2.7$^{+3.4}_{-1.2}$ kpc. The data
collected quasi-simultaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR showed the presence
of a modulation with a period of 6680$\pm$3 s in the X-ray light curves of the
source. This unveils that the compact object hosted in this system is a slowly
rotating neutron star. The broadband X-ray spectrum showed the presence of a
strong absorption ($\gg$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) and prominent emission lines at
6.4 keV, and 7.1 keV. These features are usually found in wind-fed systems, in
which the emission lines result from the fluorescence of the X-rays from the
accreting compact object on the surrounding stellar wind. The presence of a
strong absorption line around $\sim$21 keV in the NuSTAR spectrum suggests a
cyclotron origin, thus allowing us to estimate the neutron star magnetic field
as $\sim$2.4$\times$10$^{12}$ G. All evidence thus suggests IGR J17329-2731 is
a symbiotic X-ray binary. As no X-ray emission was ever observed from the
location of IGR J17329-2731 by INTEGRAL (or other X-ray facilities) during the
past 15 yr in orbit and considering that symbiotic X-ray binaries are known to
be variable but persistent X-ray sources, we concluded that INTEGRAL caught the
first detectable X-ray emission from IGR J17329-2731 when the source shined as
a symbiotic X-ray binary. The Swift/XRT monitoring performed up to $\sim$3
months after the discovery of the source, showed that it maintained a
relatively stable X-ray flux and spectral properties.

and anisotropic Bianchi-I spacetime, which was previously formulated only for
homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime. We argue in this paper that for
anisotropic spacetimes, the total anisotropy behaves as an independent metric
degree of freedom on top of the average scale factor in $f(R)$ gravity. This is
not like $GR$, where specifying the form of the average scale factor as a
function of time also specify the total anisotropy as a function of time
uniqely. We link this peculiar fact to an interesting intertwining between the
definition of Ricci scalar for anisotropic metric and anisotropy evolution
equation in $f(R)$ gravity. Consequently, specifying an anisotropic solution of
$f(R)$ gravity implies specifying both the average scale factor and the total
anisotropy as functions of time. The reconstruction method hence formulated is
applied to two scenarios where anisotropy suppression is important, namely, a
quasi de-Sitter expansion as required in inflation, and a power law contraction
as required in ekpyrotic bounce models.

potentially devastating class of cybercrimes in the past few years. In this
paper, we present RAPTOR, a promising line of defense against ransomware

activity. More specifically, our method learns features of malicious domains by
looking at examples of domains involved in known ransomware attacks, and then
monitors newly registered domains to identify potentially malicious ones. In
addition, RAPTOR uses time series forecasting techniques to learn models of
historical ransomware activity and then leverages malicious domain
registrations as an external signal to forecast future ransomware activity. We
illustrate RAPTOR's effectiveness by forecasting all activity stages of Cerber,
a popular ransomware family. By monitoring zone files of the top-level domain
.top starting from August 30, 2016 through May 31, 2017, RAPTOR predicted 2,126

are not easy to solve and many quantum algorithms will encounter, to study
matrix operations in quantum computer with high efficiency. And solving matrix
multiplication will be the first step. We propose three quantum algorithms to
matrix multiplication based on swap test, SVE and HHL. From the point of making
fewer assumptions, swap test method works the best than the other two. We also

$\widetilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon)$ with no assumptions. This is proved by giving an
efficient quantum algorithm in polynomial time to solve the input problem, that
is to prepare the quantum states of the classical data efficiently. Other
contributions of this paper include: (1). Extending swap test to a more general
form that is suitable to deal with quantum data in parallel, which will have
further applications in other matrix operations. (2). Generalizing SVE

Differential Equation (PDE) model which describes the acoustic velocity
potential in ultrasound wave propagation, where the paradox of infinite speed
of propagation of thermal signals is eliminated; the use of the constitutive
Cattaneo law for the heat flux, in place of the Fourier law, accounts for its
being of third order in time. Aiming at the understanding of the fully
quasilinear PDE, a great deal of attention has been recently devoted to its
linearization -- referred to in the literature as the Moore-Gibson-Thompson
equation -- whose mathematical analysis is also of independent interest, posing
already several questions and challenges. In this work we consider and solve a
quadratic control problem associated with the linear equation, formulated
consistently with the goal of keeping the acoustic pressure close to a
reference pressure during ultrasound excitation, as required in medical and
industrial applications. While optimal control problems with smooth controls
have been considered in the recent literature, we aim at relying on controls
which are just $L^2$ in time; this leads to a singular control problem and to
non-standard Riccati equations. In spite of the unfavourable combination of the
semigroup describing the free dynamics that is not analytic, with the
challenging pattern displayed by the dynamics subject to boundary control, a
feedback synthesis of the optimal control as well as well-posedness of operator
Riccati equations are established.

systems. Traditional CF models mainly focus on predicting a user's preference
to the items in a single domain such as the movie domain or the music domain. A
major challenge for such models is the data sparsity problem, and especially,
CF cannot make accurate predictions for the cold-start users who have no
ratings at all. Although Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) is
proposed for effectively transferring users' rating preference across different
domains, it is still difficult for existing CDCF models to tackle the
cold-start users in the target domain due to the extreme data sparsity. In this
paper, we propose a Cross-Domain Latent Feature Mapping (CDLFM) model for
cold-start users in the target domain. Firstly, in order to better characterize
users in sparse domains, we take the users' similarity relationship on rating
behaviors into consideration and propose the Matrix Factorization by
incorporating User Similarities (MFUS) in which three similarity measures are
proposed. Next, to perform knowledge transfer across domains, we propose a
neighborhood based gradient boosting trees method to learn the cross-domain
user latent feature mapping function. For each cold-start user, we learn
his/her feature mapping function based on the latent feature pairs of those
linked users who have similar rating behaviors with the cold-start user in the
auxiliary domain. And the preference of the cold-start user in the target
domain can be predicted based on the mapping function and his/her latent
features in the auxiliary domain. Experimental results on two real data sets
extracted from Amazon transaction data demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed model against other state-of-the-art methods.

motivate a focus on single-moded reactive couplings, as receivers using solely
radiative couplings are limited in sensitivity by mismatch with the dark-matter
source impedance. We define integrated sensitivity as a figure of merit in
comparing searches over a wide frequency range and show that the Bode-Fano
criterion sets a limit on integrated sensitivity in a reactively coupled
receiver. We examine single-pole resonators, a broadly used form of reactive
coupling, and show that when thermal noise dominates amplifier noise and noise
matching is optimized, substantial sensitivity is available away from the
resonator bandwidth. The Bode-Fano constraint establishes the single-pole
resonator as near-ideal for single-moded dark-matter detection. Additionally,
the optimized resonator is superior to the optimized reactive broadband
receiver at all frequencies at which a resonator may practically be made. We
optimize time allocation in a tunable resonator search using priors and derive
quantum limits on resonant search sensitivity. At low frequencies, the
application of our optimization may enhance scan rates by a few orders of

that will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety
of functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming
low $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we
create a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as
various fitting functions. The input form factors are used to generate
pseudo-data with fluctuations intended to mimic the binning and random
uncertainty of a given set of real data. All combinations of input functions
and fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated

functions that are robust for radius extractions in an objective fashion. For
the range and uncertainty of the PRad data, we find that a two-parameter
rational function, a two-parameter continued fraction and the second order
polynomial expansion of $z$ can extract the input radius regardless of the

space plasma turbulence has been recently proposed by Servidio {\it et al.}
[PRL, {\bf 119}, 205101 (2017)], supported by a three-dimensional Hermite
decomposition applied to spacecraft measurements, showing that velocity space
fluctuations of the ion velocity distribution follow a broad-band, power-law
Hermite spectrum $P(m)$, where $m$ is the Hermite index. We numerically explore
these mechanisms in a more magnetized regime. We find that (1) the plasma
reveals spectral anisotropy in velocity space, due to the presence of an
external magnetic field (analogous to spatial anisotropy of fluid and plasma
turbulence); (2) the distribution of energy follows the prediction $P(m)\sim
m^{-2}$, proposed in the above theoretical-observational work; and (3) the
velocity-space activity is intermittent in space, being enhanced close to
coherent structures such as the reconnecting current sheets produced by
turbulence. These results may be relevant to the nonlinear dynamics
weakly-collisional plasma in a wide variety of circumstances.

to reproduce the propagation of ionization fronts during the transition before
the overlap of HII regions. Many of these simulations use moment-based methods
to track radiative transfer processes using explicit solvers and are therefore
subject to strict stability conditions regarding the speed of light, which
implies a great computational cost. It can be reduced by assuming a reduced
speed of light, and this approximation is now widely used to produce
large-scale simulations of reionization. We introduce a new method for
estimating and comparing the ionization front speeds based on maps of the
reionization redshifts. We applied it to a set of cosmological simulations of
the reionization using a set of reduced speeds of light, and measured the
evolution of the ionization front speeds during the reionization process. We
find that ionization fronts progress via a two-stage process, the first stage
at low velocity as the fronts emerge from high density regions and a second
later stage just before the overlap, during which front speeds increase close
to the speed of light. Using a set of small 8Mpc/h^3 simulations, we find that
a minimal velocity of 0.3c is able to model these two stages in this specific
context without significant impact. Values as low as 0.05c can model the first
low velocity stage, but limit the acceleration at later times. Lower values
modify the distribution of front speeds at all times. Using larger 64Mpc/h^3
volumes that better account for distant sources, we find that reduced speed of
light has a greater impact on reionization times and front speeds in underdense
regions that are reionized at late times. The same quantities measured in dense
regions with slow fronts are less sensitive to c values.

seesaw mechanism which can be tested at the LHC. In addition the model provides
an explanation for the SM fermion masses and mixings. In the proposed model,
small masses for the light active neutrinos are generated by an inverse seesaw
mechanism caused by non renormalizable Yukawa operators and mediated by three
very light Majorana neutrinos and the observed hierarchy of the SM fermion

interactions and stochasticity in assembling and maintaining species-rich
communities remains a major challenge in ecology. In plant communities,
interactions between individuals of different species are expected to leave a
spatial signature in the form of positive or negative spatial correlations over
distances relating to the spatial scale of interaction. Most studies using
spatial point process tools have found relatively little evidence for
interactions between pairs of species. More interactions tend to be detected in
communities with fewer species. However, there is currently no understanding of
how the power to detect spatial interactions may change with sample size, or
the scale and intensity of interactions.
  We use a simple 2-species model where the scale and intensity of interactions
are controlled to simulate point pattern data. In combination with an
approximation to the variance of the spatial summary statistics that we sample,
we investigate the power of current spatial point pattern methods to correctly
reject the null model of bivariate species independence.
  We show that the power to detect interactions is positively related to the
abundances of the species tested, and the intensity and scale of interactions.
Increasing imbalance in abundances has a negative effect on the power to detect
interactions. At population sizes typically found in currently available
datasets for species-rich plant communities we find only a very low power to
detect interactions. Differences in power may explain the increased frequency
of interactions in communities with fewer species. Furthermore, the
community-wide frequency of detected interactions is very sensitive to a
minimum abundance criterion for including species in the analyses.

  Maneuvers",,,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a sampling-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control algorithm
is proposed for discrete-time linear systems subject to both parametric
uncertainties and additive disturbances. One of the main drivers for the
development of the proposed control strategy is the need of real-time
implementability of guidance and control strategies for automated rendezvous
and proximity operations between spacecraft. The paper presents considers the
validation of the proposed control algorithm on an experimental testbed,
showing how it may indeed be implemented in a realistic framework. Parametric
uncertainties due to the mass variations during operations, linearization
errors, and disturbances due to external space environment are simultaneously
considered.
  The approach enables to suitably tighten the constraints to guarantee robust
recursive feasibility when bounds on the uncertain variables are provided, and
under mild assumptions, asymptotic stability in probability of the origin can
be established. The offline sampling approach in the control design phase is
shown to reduce the computational cost, which usually constitutes the main
limit for the adoption of Stochastic Model Predictive Control schemes,
especially for low-cost on-board hardware. These characteristics are
demonstrated both through simulations and by means of experimental results.

the bulk material and has asymmetric broadening. These effects are straightly
related to the finite size of nanoparticles, giving the perspective to use the
Raman spectroscopy as the size probe. By combining the dynamical matrix method
(DMM) and the bond polarization model (BPM), we develop a new (DMM-BPM)
approach to the description of Raman spectra for random arrays of
nanoparticles. The numerical variant of this approach is suitable for the
description of small particles, whereas its simplier to implement analytical

Focusing on nanodiamond powders, the DMM-BPM theory is shown to fit the most

rotated an angle, a finite angular momentum develops, corresponding to a

the steady state the heat current flowing between the two baths is
systematically converted into particle rotation. We derive exact expressions
for the work rate and heat currents in the case where the system is driven by
an external time periodic mechanical force. We show, in agreement with previous
works on classical systems, that for this choice of external manipulation

resist changes of shape determined by their boundaries. However, rigid solids
cannot exist in the thermodynamic limit where boundaries become irrelevant.
Particles in the solid may rearrange to adjust to shape changes eliminating
stress without destroying crystalline order. Rigidity is therefore valid only
in the {\em metastable} state that emerges because these particle
rearrangements in response to a deformation, or strain, are associated with
slow collective processes. Here, we show that a thermodynamic collective
variable may be used to quantify particle rearrangements that occur as a solid
is deformed at zero strain rate. Advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques are
then employed to obtain the equilibrium free energy as a function of this
variable. Our results lead to a new view on rigidity: While at zero strain a
rigid crystal coexists with one that responds to infinitesimal strain by
rearranging particles and expelling stress, at finite strain the rigid crystal
is metastable, associated with a free energy barrier that decreases with
increasing strain. The rigid phase becomes thermodynamically stable by
switching on an external field, which penalises particle rearrangements. This
produces a line of first-order phase transitions in the field - strain plane
that intersects the origin. Failure of a solid once strained beyond its elastic
limit is associated with kinetic decay processes of the metastable rigid

interactions, is that there are no local observables which are independent of
the choice of the spacetime coordinates. This property acquires crucial
importance in the quantum domain in that the structure of the Hilbert space
pertinent to different observers can be drastically different. Such intriguing
phenomena as the Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect are all rooted in this
feature. As in these examples, the quantum effect due to such
observer-dependence is most conspicuous in the presence of an event horizon and
there are still many questions to be clarified in such a situation. In this
paper, we perform a comprehensive and explicit study of the observer dependence
of the quantum Hilbert space of a massless scalar field in the vicinity of the
horizon of the Schwarzschild black holes in four dimensions, both in the
eternal (two-sided) case and in the physical (one-sided) case created by
collapsing matter. Specifically, we compare and relate the Hilbert spaces of
the three types of observers, namely (i) the freely falling observer, (ii) the
observer who stays at a fixed proper distance outside of the horizon and (iii)
the natural observer inside of the horizon analytically continued from outside.
The concrete results we obtain have a number of important implications on black
hole complementarity pertinent to the quantum equivalence principle and the
related firewall phenomenon, on the number of degrees of freedom seen by each
type of observer, and on the ""thermal-type"" spectrum of particles realized in a
pure state.

materials, nickel and rhodium are standard materials used as reflective
coatings for synchrotron mirrors. Conversely, Aluminum is one of the most
commonly used materials for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray filters.
However, both of these types of optics are subject to carbon contamination,
being increasingly problematic for the operation of the high-performance free
electron laser (FEL) and synchrotron beamlines. For this reason, an inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) source has been used in conjunction with N2/O2/H2 and
N2/H2 feedstock gas plasmas. Results from the chemical surface analysis of the
above materials before and after plasma treatment using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) are reported. We conclude that a favorable combination of an
N2/H2 plasma feedstock gas mixture leads to the best chemical surface
preservation of Ni, Rh, and Al while removing the carbon contaminations.
However, this feedstock gas mixture does not remove C contaminations as rapidly
as, e.g., a N2/O2/H2 plasma which induces the surface formation of NiO and
NiOOH in Ni and RhOOH in Rh foils. As an applied case, we demonstrate the
successful carbon removal from ultrathin Al filters previously used at the

observational data over a limited period of time and several parameters to
estimate, such as growth rate, R0, serial or generation interval distribution,
latent and incubation times or case fatality rates. Also parameters describing
the temporal relations between appearance of symptoms, notification, death and
recovery/discharge will be of interest. These parameters form the basis for
predicting the future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the
progress of the disease. We study the problem of making inference during the
emerging phase of an outbreak and point out potential sources of bias related
to contact tracing, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple
potential infectors or truncation effects amplified by exponential growth.
These biases directly affect the estimation of e.g. the generation time
distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other
estimates, e.g. of R0 and growth rate. Many of the traditionally used
estimation methods in disease epidemiology may suffer from these biases when
applied to the emerging disease outbreak situation. We show how to avoid these
biases based on proper statistical modelling. We illustrate the theory by
numerical examples and simulations based on the recent 2014-15 Ebola outbreak
to quantify possible estimation biases, which may be up to 20% underestimation
of R0, if the epidemic growth rate is fitted to observed data or, conversely,
up to 62% overestimation of the growth rate if the correct R0 is used in

It is well-known that spiral attractors having a ""teacup"" geometry are typical
for this model at certain values of parameters for which the system can be
considered as slow-fast system. We show that these attractors appear due to the
Shilnikov scenario, the first step in which is associated with a supercritical
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and the last step leads to the appearance of a
homoclinic attractor containing a homoclinic loop to a saddle-focus equilibrium
with two-dimension unstable manifold. It is shown that the homoclinic spiral
attractors together with the slow-fast behavior give rise to a new type of
bursting activity in this system. Intervals of fast oscillations for such type
of bursting alternate with slow motions of two types: small amplitude
oscillations near a saddle-focus equilibrium and motions near a stable slow
manifold of a fast subsystem. We demonstrate that such type of bursting
activity can be either chaotic or regular.

known to hold in the read-only model. Using our new string representation, we
obtain the first in-place subquadratic (indeed, even sublinear in some cases)

uncertainty of a measurement can be at the best inversely proportional to the
observation time ($T$). The observation time in an experiment using a quantum
mechanical probe is ultimately limited by the coherence time of the probe.
Therefore the inverse proportionality of the statistical uncertainty of a
frequency measurement to the observation time is also limited up to the
coherence time of the probe, provided the systematic uncertainties are well
below the statistical uncertainties. With a single laser-cooled barium ion as a
quantum probe, we show that the uncertainty in the frequency measurement for a
general time-dependent Hamiltonian scales as $1/T^{1.75\pm 0.03}$ as opposed to
$1/T$, given by the Heisenberg limit for time-independent Hamiltonian. These
measurements, based on controlled feedback Hamiltonian and implemented on a
laser cooled single ion, allowed precise measurement of noise frequency in the
kHz range. Moreover, based on the observed sensitivity of a single ion

enhanced sensitivity as a tool to directly verify the existence of certain
types of light mass axion-like dark matter particles where no direct

several subsurface applications, including energy storage and extraction, and
waste storage. We are interested in flow in discrete fracture networks, which
explicitly represent flow in fracture surfaces, but ignore the impact of the
surrounding host rock. Fracture networks, generated from observations or
stochastic simulations, will contain intersections of arbitrary length, and
intersection lines can further cross, forming a highly complex geometry. As the
flow exchange between fractures, thus in the network, takes place in these
intersections, an adequate representation of the geometry is critical for
simulation accuracy. In practice, the intersection dynamics must be handled by
a combination of the simulation grid, which may or may not resolve the
intersection lines, and the numerical methods applied on the grid. In this
work, we review different classes of numerical approaches proposed in recent
years, covering both methods that conform to the grid, and non-matching cases.
Specific methods considered herein include finite element, mixed and virtual
finite elements and control volume methods. We expose our methods to an
extensive set of test cases, ranging from artificial geometries designed to
test difficult configurations, to a network extruded from a real fracture
outcrop. The main outcome is guidances for choice of simulation models and
numerical discretization with a trade off on the computational cost and
solution accuracy.

any $\lambda\in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$, the extension sheaf $\mathscr{E}({\lambda

relatively simple model of the interplay between baroclinic and barotropic
dynamics in a context where there is also a geostrophic mode. In contrast to
the much-studied one-layer rotating shallow water system, we find that as well
as the usual slow geostrophic mode, there are now two fast waves, a barotropic
mode and a baroclinic mode. This feature permits triad resonances to occur
between three fast waves, with a mixture of barotropic and baroclinic modes, an
aspect which cannot occur in the one-layer system. There are now also two
branches of the slow geostrophic mode with a repeated branch of the dispersion
relation. The consequences are explored in a derivation of the full set of
triad interaction equations, using a multi-scale asymptotic expansion based on
a small amplitude parameter. The derived nonlinear interaction coefficients are
confirmed using energy and enstrophy conservation. These triad interaction
equations are explored with an emphasis on the parameter regime with small

chromospheres leave a dramatic imprint in the intensity profile of the Ca II
854.2 nm line. Recent studies have focussed on also explaining the observed
polarization profiles, that show even more dramatic variations during the
passage of these shock fronts. While most of these variations can be explained
with an almost constant magnetic field as a function of time, several studies
have reported changes in the inferred magnetic field strength during UF phases.
In this study we investigate the origin of these periodic variations of the
magnetic field strength by analyzing a time-series of high temporal cadence
observations acquired in the Ca II line with the CRISP instrument at the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. In particular, we analyze how the inferred
geometrical height scale changes between quiescent and UF phases, and whether
those changes are enough to explain the observed changes in $B$. We have
performed non-LTE data inversions with the NICOLE code of a time-series of very
high spatio-temporal resolution observations in the Ca II and Fe I
630.15\630.25 nm lines. Our results indicate that the Ca II line in sunspots is
greatly sensitive to magnetic fields at $\log\tau_{500}=-5$ during UFs and
quiescence. However, this optical depth value does not correspond to the same
geometrical height during the two phases. Our results indicate that during UFs
and RPWs the $\log\tau=-5$ is located at a higher geometrical height than
during quiescence. Additionally, the inferred magnetic field values are higher
in UFs (~270 G) and in RPWs (~100 G). Our results suggest that opacity changes
caused by UFs and RPWs cannot explain the observed temporal variations in the
magnetic field, as the line seems to form at higher geometrical heights where
the field is expected to be lower.

learning and data analytics applications. Most existing variations of NMF only
consider how each row/column vector of factorised matrices should be shaped,
and ignore the relationship among pairwise rows or columns. In many cases, such
pairwise relationship enables better factorisation, for example, image
clustering and recommender systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm
named, Relative Pairwise Relationship constrained Non-negative Matrix
Factorisation (RPR-NMF), which places constraints over relative pairwise
distances amongst features by imposing penalties in a triplet form. Two
distance measures, squared Euclidean distance and Symmetric divergence, are
used, and exponential and hinge loss penalties are adopted for the two measures
respectively. It is well known that the so-called ""multiplicative update rules""
result in a much faster convergence than gradient descend for matrix
factorisation. However, applying such update rules to RPR-NMF and also proving
its convergence is not straightforward. Thus, we use reasonable approximations
to relax the complexity brought by the penalties, which are practically
verified. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate
that our algorithms have advantages on gaining close approximation, satisfying
a high proportion of expected constraints, and achieving superior performance
compared with other algorithms.

experimentally obtained, and the transistors also had their Early parameters
$V_a$ (the Early voltage) and $s$ (a proportionality constant such that $R_o =
1/tan(s I_B)$ accurately estimated by using an experimental-numeric procedure
that involves Hough transform accumulation in order to identify the crossing of
the base current ($I_B$) indexed characteristic isolines, yielding the
respective $V_a$. The timing measurements exhibited strong positive Pearson
correlations when taken pairwise. When these measurements were compared
individually to the respective Early parameters, no significant Pearson
correlation was obtained. However, a strong relationship was observed between
the product of the two Early parameters and the ratio between the fall and rise
time. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78 was observed between these
variables in the case of NPN devices. This suggests that transistors with
larger average current gain tend to have more similar rise and fall times. The
