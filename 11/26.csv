that the radial Reynolds number, $R$ (constructed using the radial velocity at

detailed and, in many respects, novel chart of critical curves in a region of
moderate values of $R$, and we show that, starting from values of $R$, as low

substitute the classical Taylor vortices. Also, we have looked more closely at
the effect of a weak radial flow (relatively low $R$) on the Taylor instability
and found that a radial flow directed from the inner cylinder to the outer one
is capable of stabilizing the Couette-Taylor flow provided that the gap between
the cylinders is wide enough. This observation is in a sharp contrast with the
case of relatively narrow gaps for which the opposite effect is well-known.

one-step-ahead conditional prediction intervals for large $n \times T$ panels

has plateaued. Motivated by increasing charge-carrier mobility within the
device channel to improve transistor performance, germanium (Ge) is considered
as an attractive option as a silicon replacement due to its highest p-type
mobility in all of the known semiconductor materials and being compatible with
today's conventional CMOS manufacturing process. However, the intrinsically
high carrier mobility of Ge becomes significantly degraded because Ge's native
oxide is unstable and readily decomposes into several GexOy suboxides with a
high density of dangling bonds at the surface. In addition, these interface
trap states will also degrade the off-state leakage current and subthreshold
turn-off of a Ge-based device, significantly affecting its stability.
Furthermore, obtaining low-resistance Ohmic contacts to n-type Ge is another
key challenge in developing Ge CMOS. To solve these challenges, extensive
efforts have been made about the incorporation of new materials, such as Al2O3,
SiN3, TiO2, ZnO, Ge3N4, MgO, HfO2, SrTiO3, and Y2O3, into Ge transistors.
Controlling the diffusion of foreign atoms into Ge is therefore a critical
issue in developing Ge transistors regarding that foreign impurities may be
detrimental to devices. In this work, we study the diffusion properties of all
common elements in Ge by performing the first-principle calculations with a
nudged elastic band method. We find some large atoms, such as Cu, Au, Pd, etc.,
have a very small diffusion barrier. We reveal the underlying mechanism in a
combination of local distortion induced by size effect and bonding effect that
controls the diffusion behaviors of different atoms in Ge. This comprehensive
study and relatively in-depth understanding of diffusion in Ge provides us with
a practical guide for utilizing it more efficiently in semiconductor devices.

physics and provides sensitive means to uncover the details of the weak
interaction. Neutron beta decay can evaluate the ratio of axial-vector to
vector coupling constants in the standard model, $\lambda = g_A / g_V$, through
multiple decay correlations. The Nab experiment will carry out measurements of
the electron-neutrino correlation parameter $a$ with a precision of $\delta a /
a = 10^{-3}$ and the Fierz interference term $b$ to $\delta b = 3\times10^{-3}$
in unpolarized free neutron beta decay. These results, along with a more
precise measurement of the neutron lifetime, aim to deliver an independent
determination of the ratio $\lambda$ with a precision of $\delta \lambda /
\lambda = 0.03\%$ that will allow an evaluation of $V_{ud}$ and sensitively
test CKM unitarity, independent of nuclear models. Nab utilizes a novel, long
asymmetric spectrometer that guides the decay electron and proton to two large
area silicon detectors in order to precisely determine the electron energy and
an estimation of the proton momentum from the proton time of flight. The Nab

intelligence (CTI) is gaining attention as a way to collect meaningful

predict future attacks. A systemic threat analysis based on data acquired from
actual cyber incidents is a useful approach to generating intelligence for such
an objective. Developing an analysis technique requires a high volume and fine
quality data. However, researchers can become discouraged by an inaccessibility
to data because organizations rarely release their data to the research

biased toward techniques that develope steps of the CTI process other than
analysis and production. In this paper, we propose an automated dataset

publicly available security reports and malware repositories. The data are
stored in a structured format. We released the source codes and dataset to the

a rise time of 18.3$\pm$0.3 days and $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)=0.96\pm$0.03 mag, but
it seems to have bluer $B - V$ colors. We construct the ""uvoir"" bolometric
light curve having peak luminosity as 1.49$\times$10$^{43}$erg s$^{-1}$, from
which we derive a nickel mass as 0.55$\pm$0.04M$_{\odot}$ by fitting radiation
diffusion models powered by centrally located $^{56}$Ni. Note that the moment
when nickel-powered luminosity starts to emerge is +3.85 days after the first
light in the Kepler data, suggesting other origins of the early-time emission,
e.g., mixing of $^{56}$Ni to outer layers of the ejecta or interaction between
the ejecta and nearby circumstellar material or a non-degenerate companion
star. The spectral evolution of SN 2018oh is similar to that of a normal SN Ia,
but is characterized by prominent and persistent carbon absorption features.
The C II features can be detected from the early phases to about 3 weeks after
the maximum light, representing the latest detection of carbon ever recorded in
a SN Ia. This indicates that a considerable amount of unburned carbon exists in
the ejecta of SN 2018oh and may mix into deeper layers.

Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2018oh (ASASSN-18bt), starting weeks before explosion,
covering the moment of explosion and the subsequent rise, and continuing past
peak brightness. These data are supplemented by multi-color Pan-STARRS1 and
CTIO 4-m DECam observations obtained within hours of explosion. The K2 light
curve has an unusual two-component shape, where the flux rises with a steep
linear gradient for the first few days, followed by a quadratic rise as seen
for typical SNe Ia. This ""flux excess"" relative to canonical SN Ia behavior is
confirmed in our $i$-band light curve, and furthermore, SN 2018oh is especially
blue during the early epochs. The flux excess peaks 2.14$\pm0.04$ days after
explosion, has a FWHM of 3.12$\pm0.04$ days, a blackbody temperature of
$T=17,500^{+11,500}_{-9,000}$ K, a peak luminosity of
$4.3\pm0.2\times10^{37}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, and a total integrated energy of
$1.27\pm0.01\times10^{43}\,{\rm erg}$. We compare SN 2018oh to several models
that may provide additional heating at early times, including collision with a
companion and a shallow concentration of radioactive nickel. While all of these
models generally reproduce the early K2 light curve shape, we slightly favor a
companion interaction, at a distance of $\sim$$2\times10^{12}\,{\rm cm}$ based
on our early color measurements, although the exact distance depends on the
uncertain viewing angle. Additional confirmation of a companion interaction in
future modeling and observations of SN 2018oh would provide strong support for
a single-degenerate progenitor system.

a sequential combustor at atmospheric and high pressure. The sequential burner
(SB) features a mixing section with fuel injection into a hot vitiated
crossflow. Depending on the dominant combustion mode, a recirculation zone
assists flame anchoring in the combustion chamber. The flame is located
sufficiently downstream of the injector resulting in partially premixed
conditions. First, combustion regime maps are obtained from 0-D and 1-D
simulations showing the co-existence of three combustion modes: autoignition,
flame propagation and flame propagation assisted by autoignition. These regime
maps can be used to understand the combustion modes at play in turbulent
sequential combustors, as shown with 3-D large eddy simulations (LES) with
semi-detailed chemistry. In addition to the simulation of steady-state
combustion at three different operating conditions, transient simulations are
performed: (i) ignition of the combustor with autoignition as the dominant
mode, (ii) ignition that is initiated by autoignition and that is followed by a
transition to a propagation stabilized flame, and (iii) a transient change of
the inlet temperature (decrease by 150 K) resulting into a change of the
combustion regime. These results show the importance of the recirculation zone
for the ignition and the anchoring of a propagating type flame. On the
contrary, the autoignition flame stabilizes due to continuous self-ignition of
the mixture and the recirculation zone does not play an important role for the
flame anchoring.

algorithm for Bayesian learning from large scale datasets. While SGLD with

algorithm is often used with a constant step size in practice and has
demonstrated successes in machine learning tasks. The current practice is to
set the step size inversely proportional to $N$ where $N$ is the number of

invariant probability measure which significantly departs from the target

is inherently due to the high variance of the stochastic gradients. Several
strategies have been suggested to reduce this effect; among them, SGLD Fixed

suitability of long-term monitoring of pediatric asthma using diverse data to
qualify and quantify triggers that contribute to the asthma symptoms and
control to enable a personalized management plan.
  Materials and Methods: Asthma condition, environment, and adherence to the
prescribed care plan were continuously tracked for 97 pediatric patients using
kHealth-Asthma technology for one or three months.
  Result: At the cohort level, among 21% of the patients deployed in spring,
63% and 19% indicated pollen and Particulate Matter (PM2.5), respectively, as
the major asthma contributors. Of the 18% of the patients deployed in fall, 29%
and 21% found pollen and PM2.5 respectively, to be the contributors. For the
28% of the patients deployed in winter, PM2.5 was identified as the major
contributor for 80% of them. One patient across each season has been chosen to
explain the determination of personalized triggers by observing correlations
between triggers and asthma symptoms gathered from anecdotal evidence.
  Discussion and Conclusion: Both public and personal health signals including
compliance to prescribed care plan have been captured through continuous
monitoring using the kHealth-Asthma technology which generated insights on
causes of asthma symptoms across different seasons. Collectively, they can form
the underlying basis for personalized management plan and intervention.

operates on physical signals. They are commonly designed to accurately
represent the underlying signal, regardless of the specific task to be
performed on the quantized data. In systems working with high-dimensional
signals, such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, it is
beneficial to utilize low-resolution quantizers, due to cost, power, and memory
constraints. In this work we study quantization of high-dimensional inputs,
aiming at improving performance under resolution constraints by accounting for
the system task in the quantizers design. We focus on the task of recovering a
desired signal statistically related to the high-dimensional input, and analyze
two quantization approaches: We first consider vector quantization, which is
typically computationally infeasible, and characterize the optimal performance
achievable with this approach. Next, we focus on practical systems which
utilize hardware-limited scalar uniform analog-to-digital converters (ADCs),
and design a task-based quantizer under this model. The resulting system
accounts for the task by linearly combining the observed signal into a lower
dimension prior to quantization. We then apply our proposed technique to
channel estimation in massive MIMO networks. Our results demonstrate that a
system utilizing low-resolution scalar ADCs can approach the optimal channel
estimation performance by properly accounting for the task in the system
design.

Dense star clusters composed of stellar mass particles are started within a

a Milky Way like halo. Hierarchical assembly causes the early-time tidal star
streams from the clusters to later be dispersed as thick streams around the
thin streams that develop in the main late-time halo as it settles towards
equilibrium. The two simulations are set up to be essentially dynamically
identical and result in about 140 star clusters within a radius of 50 kpc, of
which 40 some have thin tidal streams longer than 40\degr\ with a separation of
more than 20\degr\ from the cluster as viewed from the halo center. Averaged

First, we propose a novel Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching (RCM) approach that

reward to encourage global matching between instructions and trajectories, and
a reasoning navigator is employed to perform cross-modal grounding in the local

  Specifically, we consider a two-sided market model, in which a local monopoly
ISP prices Internet access to consumers and possibly to CPs as well. The CPs
then decide whether to enter a competitive but differentiated market and the
consumers decide whether to connect to the ISP. Unlike prior works, we model
competition between the CPs together with consumer valuation of content and

problems. The objective function and constraints consist of multiple terms
designed for different clinical and practical considerations. Weighting factors
of these terms are needed to define the optimization problem. While a treatment
planning system can solve the optimization problem with given weights,
adjusting the weights for high plan quality is performed by human. The weight
tuning task is labor intensive, time consuming, and it critically affects the
final plan quality. An automatic weight-tuning approach is strongly desired.
The weight tuning procedure is essentially a decision making problem. Motivated
by the tremendous success in deep learning for decision making with human-level
intelligence, we propose a novel framework to tune the weights in a human-like
manner. Using treatment planning in high-dose-rate brachytherapy as an example,
we develop a weight tuning policy network (WTPN) that observes dose volume
histograms of a plan and outputs an action to adjust organ weights, similar to
the behaviors of a human planner. We train the WTPN via end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning. Experience replay is performed with the epsilon greedy
algorithm. Then we apply the trained WTPN to guide treatment planning of
testing patient cases. The trained WTPN successfully learns the treatment
planning goals to guide the weight tuning process. On average, the quality
score of plans generated under the WTPN's guidance is improved by ~8.5%
compared to the initial plan with arbitrary weights, and by 10.7% compared to
the plans generated by human planners. To our knowledge, this is the first tool
to adjust weights for the treatment planning in a human-like fashion based on
learnt intelligence. The study demonstrates potential feasibility to develop
intelligent treatment planning system via deep reinforcement learning.

important task across various scientific fields including statistics,
engineering, computer science, mathematics, and many more. In general, this
learning task is ill-posed; however, additional information about the data's
structure or on the behavior of the unknown function can make the task
well-posed. In this work, we study the problem of learning nonlinear functions
from corrupted and dependent data. The learning problem is recast as a sparse
robust linear regression problem where we incorporate both the unknown
coefficients and the corruptions in a basis pursuit framework. The main
contribution of our paper is to provide a reconstruction guarantee for the
associated $\ell_1$-optimization problem where the sampling matrix is formed
from dependent data. Specifically, we prove that the sampling matrix satisfies
the null space property and the stable null space property, provided that the
data is compact and satisfies a suitable concentration inequality. We show that
our recovery results are applicable to various types of dependent data such as
exponentially strongly $\alpha$-mixing data, geometrically $\mathcal{C}$-mixing
data, and uniformly ergodic Markov chain. Our theoretical results are verified
via several numerical simulations.

bounding boxes and superpixels as linear constraints and simultaneously
discriminates between foreground and background at bounding box and superpixel

theory, including sensitivity to initial conditions, have caused the resulting

exterior derivative d, an interior derivative i_X and its Lie derivative L_X.
We use this formula to define a finite dimensional vector space of vector
fields X on a finite abstract simplicial complex G. This space has a Lie
algebra structure satisfying L_[X,Y] = L_X L_Y - L_Y L_X as in the continuum.
Any such vector field X defines a coordinate change on the finite dimensional
vector space l^2(G) which play the role of translations along the vector field.
If i_X^2=0, the relation L_X=D_X^2 with D_X=i_X+d mirrors the Hodge
factorization L=D^2, where D=d+d^* we can see f_t = - L_X f defining the flow
of X as the analogue of the heat equation f_t = - L f and view the Newton type
equations f'' = -L_X f as the analogue of the wave equation f'' = -L f.
Similarly as the wave equation is solved by u(t)=exp(i Dt) u(0) with complex
valued u(t)=f(t)-i D^-1 f_t(t), also any second order differential equation f''
= -L_X f is solved by u(t) = exp(i D_X t) u(0) in l^2(G,C}). If X is supported
on odd forms, the factorization property L_X = D_X^2 extends to the Lie algebra
and i_[X,Y] remains an inner derivative. If the kernel of L_X on p-forms has
dimension b_p(X), then the general Euler-Poincare formula holds for every
parameter field X. Extreme cases are i_X=d^*, where b_k are the usual Betti
numbers and X=0, where b_k=f_k(G) are the components of the f-vector of the
simplicial complex G. We also note that the McKean-Singer super-symmetry
extends from L to Lie derivatives. It also holds for L_X on Riemannian
manifolds. the non-zero spectrum of L_X on even forms is the same than the
non-zero spectrum of L_X on odd forms. We also can deform with D_X' = [B_X,D_X]
of D_X=d+i_X + b_X, B_X=d_X-d_X^*+i b_X the exterior derivative d governed by
the vector field X.

the sense of smell inexplicable by models in which molecular structure alone
determines an odorant's smell. Amazingly, behavioral and neurophysiological
evidence suggests that humans and some insects can be trained to distinguish
isotopologue molecules which are related by the substitution of isotopes for
certain atoms, such as a hydrogen-to-deuterium substitution. How is it possible
to smell a neutron? The physics of olfaction may explain this isotopomer
effect. Inelastic electron transfer spectroscopy (IETS) has been proposed as a
candidate mechanism for such subtle olfactory effects: the vibrational spectrum
of an appropriately-quantized odorant molecule may enhance a transfer rate in a
discriminating electron transfer (ET) process. In contrast to other
semi-classical or quantum-master-equation-based models of olfactory IETS, the
model presented here explicitly treats the dynamics of a dominant odorant
vibrational mode, which provides an indirect dissipative path from the electron
to the thermal environment. A direct dissipative path to the environment also
is included. Within this model, a calculation of ET rate is developed, along
with a calculation of power dissipation to the thermal environment. Under very
weak direct dissipative coupling, spectroscopic behaviors of the indirect path
are revealed, and the resulting ET rate exhibits resonant peaks at certain
odorant frequencies. Resonant peaks in ET rate also correlate to peaks in power
dissipation. Spectroscopic behaviors are masked by strong direct dissipative
coupling. Results support a rate-based discrimination between a preferred
ligand and an isotopomer if indirect dissipative coupling dominates.

a novel probabilistic registration method that achieves state-of-the-art

cast as a maximum likelihood estimation and solved using the EM algorithm. We

improved efficiency while retaining sufficient accuracy for our task.
Additionally, we present a simple and efficient twist parameterization that
generalizes our method to the registration of articulated and deformable

independent of the Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs), which makes it highly efficient
even for high DOF systems. The results demonstrate the proposed method

to mutually unbiased bases which have a large current literature. Finally, we

toroidal system volumetrically driven by an unbounded streaming plasma is
further extended systematically for different aspect-ratio of the bounded dust
domain and a wide range of the kinematic viscosity. This work has demonstrated
the interplay between inertial and diffusive transport processes for the
structural changes of steady dust flow from symmetric into asymmetric nature in
higher Reynolds number (Re) regimes where flow streamlines turn more circular
and the structural bifurcation takes place through a threshold parameter. In
agreement with many experimental observations, the steady vortex structure in
highly nonlinear (i.e., high Re) regime is characterized by the critical
transition into a new self-similar multiple co-rotating vortices, along with
circular core region of single characteristics size and surrounded by strongly
sheared layers filled with weak vortices near the boundaries. It is further
revealed that the core region persists for a wide range of system parameters in
the nonlinear regime and its characteristic size is mainly determined by the
smallest distance between the confining boundaries. The threshold parameter,
the vortex size, the strength, and the number of the self-similar co-rotating
vortices mainly depend on the aspect-ratio of the bounded dust domain. These
nonlinear solutions provide insight into the phenomena of the structural
transition and coexistence of self-similar steady co-rotating vortices in dusty

investigate a giant dark channel crossing the solar equator, which consists of
two filament channels with different chiralities. From 2016 April 22 to April
27, this giant dark channel occupied the solar disk. Within this giant channel,
a filament channel with dextral chirality was detected in the northern
hemisphere, and another filament channel with sinistral chirality was observed
in the southern hemisphere. At the junction of the two filament channels, a
cusp structure was observed associated with active region (AR) 12532 near the
solar equator. The extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic fields reveal that
this cusp structure was composed of two sets of field lines belonging to two
different filament channels and was rooted on the AR positive-polarity fields.
In addition, dark material flows from filaments in the two channels to the cusp
structure were detected as well as the flux emergence and cancellation around
the cusp footpoints. On 2016 May 21, after a solar rotation, the cusp structure
had disappeared, and the giant dark channel broke in the middle where another
AR, 12546, had emerged completely. We propose that the magnetic flux emergence
and cancellation around the cusp region resulted in the disappearance of the
cusp structure and the break of the giant dark channel.

types of preferences: long-term ones and short-term ones. The former refers to
user' inherent purchasing bias and evolves slowly. By contrast, the latter
reflects users' purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both
affect users' current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have
been dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To
this end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed
as ALSTP, for personalized product search. Our model adopts the neural networks
approach to learn and integrate the long- and short-term user preferences with
the current query for the personalized product search. In particular, two
attention networks are designed to distinguish which factors in the short-term

This unique design enables our model to capture users' current search
intentions more accurately. Our work is the first to apply attention mechanisms

end of the declining phase of the historically weak solar cycle 24. We obtain
new insights concerning the geometry and kinematics of CME-driven shocks in
relation to their heliospheric impacts from the optimal, multi-spacecraft
observations of the eruption. The shock, which together with the CME driver can
be tracked from the early stage to the outer corona, shows a large oblate
structure produced by the vast expansion of the ejecta. The expansion speeds of
the shock along the radial and lateral directions are much larger than the
translational speed of the shock center, all of which increase during the flare
rise phase, peak slightly after the flare maximum and then decrease. The near
simultaneous arrival of the CME-driven shock at the Earth and Mars, which are
separated by 156.6$^{\circ}$ in longitude, is consistent with the dominance of
expansion over translation observed near the Sun. The shock decayed and failed
to reach STEREO A around the backward direction. Comparison between ENLIL MHD
simulations and the multi-point in situ measurements indicates that the shock
expansion near the Sun is crucial for determining the arrival or non-arrival
and space weather impact at certain heliospheric locations. The large shock
geometry and kinematics have to be taken into account and properly treated for
accurate predictions of the arrival time and space weather impact of CMEs.

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and conducted a

quantify the usability of a gesture by the number of corners and the frame
length of all gesture samples, quantify the security using the equal error rate
(EER), and the consistency by EER over a period of time. Meanwhile, we obtain
subjective evaluation of usability and security by conducting a survey. By
examining the responses, we found that the subjective evaluation confirms with
the objective ones, and usability is in inverse relationship with security. We
studied the consistency of gestures and found that most participants forgot
gestures to some degree and reinforcing the memorization of gestures is
necessary to improve the authentication performance. Finally, we performed a
study with another 17 participants on shoulder surfing attacks, where attackers
can observe the victims multiple times. The results show that shoulder surfing
does not help to boost the attacks.

environments, maintaining and creating maintainable and dependable code becomes
harder and more costly. Refactoring is considered as a method for enhancing the
internal structure of code for improving many software properties such as
maintainability.
  In this thesis, the subject of refactoring software packages using community
detection algorithms is discussed, with a focus on the notion of package
stability. The proposed algorithm starts by extracting a package dependency
network from Java byte code and a community detection algorithm is used to find
possible changes in package structures. In this work, the reasons for the
importance of considering dependency directions while modeling package
dependencies with graphs are also discussed, and a proof for the relationship
between package stability and the modularity of package dependency graphs is
presented that shows how modularity is in favor of package stability.
  For evaluating the proposed algorithm, a tool for live analysis of software
packages is implemented, and two software systems are tested. Results show that
modeling package dependencies with directed graphs and applying the presented
refactoring method, leads to a higher increase in package stability than
undirected graph modeling approaches that have been studied in the literature.

species coexist even when limited by a single resource. It has been argued that
metabolite secretion creates new niches and facilitates such diversity.
Nonetheless, it is still a controversial topic why cells secrete even essential
metabolites so often; in fact, even under isolation conditions, microbial cells
secrete various metabolites, including those essential for their growth. First,
we demonstrate that leaking essential metabolites can be advantageous. If the
intracellular chemical reactions include multibody reactions like catalytic
reactions, this advantageous leakage of essential metabolites is possible and
indeed typical for most metabolic networks via ""flux control"" and
""growth-dilution"" mechanisms; the later is a result of the balance between
synthesis and growth-induced dilution with autocatalytic reactions.
Counterintuitively, the mechanisms can work even when the supplied resource is
scarce. Next, when such cells are crowded, the presence of another cell type,
which consumes the leaked chemicals is beneficial for both cell types, so that
their coexistence enhances the growth of both. The latter part of the paper is
devoted to the analysis of such unusual form of symbiosis: ""consumer"" cell
types benefit from the uptake of metabolites secreted by ""leaker"" cell types,
and such consumption reduces the concentration of metabolites accumulated in
the environment; this environmental change enables further secretion from the
leaker cell types. This situation leads to frequency-dependent coexistence of
several cell types, as supported by extensive simulations. A new look at the
diversity in a microbial ecosystem is thus presented.

captured at a relatively low frame-rate and often suffer from motion blur. A
blurry image can be regarded as the integral of a sequence of latent images,
while the events indicate the changes between the latent images. Therefore, we
are able to model the blur-generation process by associating event data to a
latent image. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective approach, the
\textbf{Event-based Double Integral (EDI)} model, to reconstruct a high
frame-rate, sharp video from a single blurry frame and its event data. The
video generation is based on solving a simple non-convex optimization problem
in a single scalar variable. Experimental results on both synthetic and real
images demonstrate the superiority of our EDI model and optimization method in
comparison to the state-of-the-art.

technique is applied based on similarity to expand the collection of

trained on these pseudo-sentences using word2vec. For evaluation, we validate
the paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations of morpheme embeddings, and apply
the obtained embeddings to word similarity measurement, achieving significant
improvements over the classical models by more than 5 Spearman scores or 8

Bayesian inverse problems. A widely used approach for sampling posterior
distribution is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, the samples
generated by MCMC are usually strongly correlated. This may lead to a small
size of effective samples from a long Markov chain and the resultant posterior
estimate may be inaccurate. An implicit sampling method proposed in [11] can
generate independent samples and capture some inherent non-Gaussian features of
the posterior based on the weights of samples. In the implicit sampling method,
the posterior samples are generated by constructing a map and distribute around
the MAP point. However, the weights of implicit sampling in previous works may
cause excessive concentration of samples and lead to ensemble collapse. To
overcome this issue, we propose a new weight formulation and make resampling
based on the new weights. In practice, some parameters in prior density are
often unknown and a hierarchical Bayesian inference is necessary for posterior
exploration. To this end, the hierarchical Bayesian formulation is used to
estimate the MAP point and integrated in the implicit sampling framework.
Compared to conventional implicit sampling, the proposed implicit sampling
method can significantly improve the posterior estimator and the applicability
for high dimensional inverse problems. The improved implicit sampling method is
applied to the Bayesian inverse problems of multi-term time fractional
diffusion models in heterogeneous media. To effectively capture the
heterogeneity effect, we present a mixed generalized multiscale finite element
method (mixed GMsFEM) to solve the time fractional diffusion models in a coarse
grid, which can substantially speed up the Bayesian inversion.

is the pseudogap phase(PG) at temperatures above the superconducting transition
temperature in the underdoped regime. The PG phase is found by the
angle-resolved photoemission spectra(ARPES) to have a gap at some regions in
momentum space and a fraction of Fermi surface remained, known as Fermi arcs.
The arc turns into a d-wave SC gap with a node below the SC transition
temperature. Here, by studying a strongly correlated model at low temperatures,
we obtained a phase characterized by two kinds of pairing order parameters with
the total momentum of the Cooper pair to be zero and finite. The finite
momentum pairing is accompanied with a spatial modulation of pairing order,
i.e. a pair density wave (PDW). These PDW phases are intertwined with
modulations of charge density and intra-unit cell form factors. The coexistence
of the two different pairing orders provides the unique two-gaps like spectra
observed by ARPES for superconducting cuprates. As temperature raises, the zero
momentum pairing order vanishes while the finite momentum pairing orders are
kept, thus Fermi arcs are realized. The calculated quasiparticle spectra has
the similar doping and temperature dependence as reported by ARPES and scanning
tunneling spectroscopy(STS). The consequence of breaking symmetry between x and
y due to the unidirectional PDW and the possibility to probe such a PDW state
in the PG phase is discussed.

carbon grain destruction on the chemical structure of disks by calculating the
molecular abundances and distributions using a comprehensive chemical reaction
network. When carbon grains are destroyed and the elemental abundance of the
gas becomes carbon-rich, the abundances of carbon-bearing molecules, such as
HCN and carbon-chain molecules, increase dramatically near the midplane, while

quantitative discrepancies: the model shows a higher value at the position of
asteroid belt and a lower value at the location of the Earth. In addition,
using the obtained molecular abundances distributions, coupled with line
radiative transfer calculations, we make predictions for ALMA to potentially
observe the effect of carbon grain destruction in nearby protoplanetary disks.

compensate for high propagation loss in the mmWave band, high-gain directional
antennas have to be employed, while it is critical to optimize multicast
service in order to improve the network performance. In this paper, an
efficient multicast scheduling scheme is proposed for small cells in the mmWave
band, called MD2D, where both D2D communications in close proximity and
multi-level antenna codebook are utilized. Specifically, a user partition and
multicast path planning algorithm is proposed to partition the users in the
multicast group into subsets and to determine the transmission node for each
subset, so as to achieve optimal utilization of D2D communications and
multi-level antenna codebook. Then a multicast scheduling algorithm schedules
the transmission for each subset. Furthermore, in order to optimize the network
performance, the optimal choice of user partition thresholds is analyzed.
Performance evaluation demonstrate that the MD2D achieves the best performance,
in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency, compared with other
existing schemes. MD2D improves the network throughput compared with the
second-best scheme by about 27\%.

We show that the formation of DSs is not restricted in the domain exhibiting
positive nonlinearity. Stable DSs are excited even in the regime where the
nonlinearity is negative. Based on the numeric sign of dispersion and nonlinear
coefficient, we classify the operational regime into four discrete domains and
study the formation of DSs in those regimes. We design a realistic waveguide
that exhibits strong frequency dependent nonlinearity which changes its sign
across a certain frequency called zero-nonlinearity point (ZNP). We adopt a
variational technique to theoretically study the overall dynamics of DSs under
various perturbations by choosing Pereira-Stenflo type soliton as our ansatz
since it is the natural solution of the unperturbed GLE. An extensive numerical
study reveals that the ZNP plays a dominant role on the pulse dynamics and
depending on its relative location with respect to input frequency, it can
either suppress or enhance Raman induced frequency down-shifting. This is
further supported by the variational method which quantitatively determines the
location of the Raman frequency as a function of the ZNP. The dispersive
radiation generated due to third-order dispersion changes drastically with the
location of the ZNP. We analytically derive a phase matching equation that
predicts the location of radiation frequency in presence of the ZNP.

chance-constrained optimal power flow (OPF) formulations and various solution
methodologies have been proposed. However, conventional solution approaches
often rely on accurate estimates of uncertainty distributions, which may not
exist. When the distributions are not known but can be limited to a set of
plausible distributions, termed an ambiguity set, distributionally robust (DR)
optimization can be used to ensure that chance constraints hold for all
distributions in that set. However, DR OPF yields conservative solutions if the
ambiguity set is too large. In this paper, we assess the value of using both
moment and unimodality information, which shrinks the ambiguity set and reduces
conservatism, in DR OPF problems. Most practical uncertainty distributions in
power systems are unimodal. Exact reformulations, approximations, and efficient
solving techniques were developed in a previous paper. This paper develops an
optimal parameter selection approach that searches for an optimal
approximation, significantly improving the computational efficiency and
solution quality. We evaluate the performance of the approach against existing

Nanodiamond particles, rich in Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers, have attracted
attention as alternative DNP agents because they can potentially be optically
hyperpolarized at room temperature. Indeed the realization of a miniature
""optical nanodiamond hyperpolarizer"", where 13C nuclei are optically
hyperpolarized has been a longstanding goal but has been technically
challenging to achieve. Here, unravelling new physics underlying an optical DNP
mechanism first introduced in [Ajoy et al., Sci. Adv. 4, eaar5492 (2018)], we
report the realization of such a device in an ultracompact footprint and
working fully at room temperature. Instrumental requirements are very modest:
low polarizing fields, extremely low optical and microwave irradiation powers,
and convenient frequency ranges that enable device miniaturization. We obtain
best reported optical 13C hyperpolarization in diamond particles exceeding 720
times of the thermal 7T value (0.86% bulk polarization), corresponding to a
ten-million-fold gain in NMR averaging time. In addition the hyperpolarization
signal can be background-suppressed by over two-orders of magnitude and
retained for multiple-minute long periods. Besides compelling applications in
quantum sensing, and bright-contrast MRI imaging, this work paves the way for
low-cost DNP platforms that relay the 13C polarization to liquids in contact
with the high surface-area particles. This will ultimately allow development of
miniature ""quantum-assisted"" NMR spectrometers for chemical analysis.

tilted configurations is equal to 2.17 mm, 1.72mm and 5.90mm

characterization of breast mechanics. However, the model presents some
limitations when estimating the supine tilted breast configuration. The results
show clearly the difficulties to characterize soft tissues mechanics at large

object (typically, an early-type galaxy) is encircled by a large-scale ring of
stars, gas, and dust with almost perpendicular spin. PRGs are rare objects and
their formation mechanism is not entirely clear. In this paper, we present a
new sample of 31 candidates to PRGs identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). Using their stacked $gri$ images, we determined geometrical parameters
of these galaxies (the position angle and the size of the host galaxy and the
ring). We compare our sample objects to the previously known PRGs and discuss
their general characteristics (the frequency of faint outer structures, the
luminosity--size relation, and the distribution by the apparent angle between
the ring and the host galaxy). Our main results are: (i) Central galaxies of
PRGs follow the luminosity--size relation for ordinary galaxies. The ring
components are located along the similar relation but with a larger scatter.
This increasing scatter may be the result of a secondary origin of polar
structures. (ii) At least half of PRGs show a ring component within 20$^\circ$
from the perpendicular orientation.

phenotypes provide an unprecedented opportunity to infer the causal effect of
one phenotype (exposure) on another (outcome). Mendelian randomization (MR), an
instrumental variable (IV) method, has been introduced for causal inference
using GWAS data. Due to the polygenic architecture of complex traits/diseases
and the ubiquity of pleiotropy, however, MR has many unique challenges compared
to conventional IV methods. We propose a Bayesian weighted Mendelian
randomization (BWMR) for causal inference to address these challenges. In our
BWMR model, the uncertainty of weak effects owing to polygenicity has been
taken into account and the violation of IV assumption due to pleiotropy has
been addressed through outlier detection by Bayesian weighting. To make the
causal inference based on BWMR computationally stable and efficient, we
developed a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm. Moreover, we
have also derived an exact closed-form formula to correct the posterior
covariance which is often underestimated in variational inference. Through
comprehensive simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of BWMR,
demonstrating the advantage of BWMR over its competitors. Then we applied BWMR
to make causal inference between 130 metabolites and 93 complex human traits,
uncovering novel causal relationship between exposure and outcome traits. The
BWMR software is available at https://github.com/jiazhao97/BWMR.

a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on multi-stage

SMT, including non-Manhattan SMT and Manhattan SMT. Firstly, in order to be
able to handle two types of SMT problems at the same time, an effective
edge-vertex encoding strategy is proposed. Secondly, a multi-stage
transformation strategy is proposed to both expand the algorithm search space
and ensure the effective convergence. We have tested three types from two to
four stages and various combinations under each type to highlight the best
combination. Thirdly, the genetic operators combined with union-find partition
are designed to construct the discrete particle update formula for discrete
VLSI routing. Moreover, in order to introduce uncertainty and diversity into
the search of PSO algorithm, we propose an improved mutation operation with
edge transformation. Experimental results show that our algorithm from a global
perspective of multilayer structure can achieve the best solution quality among
the existing algorithms. Finally, to our best knowledge, it is the first work
to address both manhattan and non-manhattan routing at the same time.

observations. A tiny kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the visible

dark matter is explained by the $B-L$ symmetry, while the dark matter asymmetry
originates from the $B-L$ asymmetry generated by thermal leptogenesis. In our
minimal setup, the Standard Model sector and the dark sector are unified into
$SU(5)_\mathrm{GUT} \times SU(4)_\mathrm{DGUT}$ gauge theories, respectively.
This model generates required $B-L$ portal operators while suppressing unwanted

more than 16km baselines.
  Results: At a spatial resolution of 18/40au (depending on the distance), we
identify twelve sub-structures within the inner few thousand au of the region.
The brightness temperatures are high, reaching values greater 1000K,
signposting high optical depth toward the peak positions. Core separations vary
between sub-100au to several 100 and 1000au. The core separations and
approximate masses are largely consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation of a
dense gas core. Due to the high continuum optical depth, most spectral lines
are seen in absorption. However, a few exceptional emission lines are found
that most likely stem from transitions with excitation conditions above1000K.
Toward the main continuum source, these emission lines exhibit a velocity
gradient across scales of 100-200au aligned with the molecular outflow and
perpendicular to the previously inferred disk orientation. While we cannot
exclude that these observational features stem from an inner hot accretion
disk, the alignment with the outflow rather suggests that it stems from the
inner jet and outflow region. The highest-velocity features are found toward
the peak position, and no Hubble-like velocity structure can be identified.
Therefore, these data are consistent with steady-state turbulent entrainment of
the hot molecular gas via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the interface
between the jet and the outflow.
  Conclusions: Resolving this high-mass star-forming region at sub-50au scales
indicates that the hierarchical fragmentation process in the framework of
thermal Jeans fragmentation can continue down to the smallest accessible
spatial scales. Velocity gradients on these small scales have to be treated
cautiously and do not necessarily stem from disks, but may be better explained
with outflow emission.

by estimating the position in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Finally,
MonoGRNet is jointly learned by optimizing the locations and poses of the 3D

such as cloud computing and social networking, not only transmission but also
processing is done on the internet. Therefore, a lot of studies on secure,
efficient and flexible communications have been reported. Moreover, huge
training data sets are required for machine learning and deep learning
algorithms to obtain high performance. However, it requires large cost to
collect enough training data while maintaining people's privacy. Nobody wants
to include their personal data into datasets because providers can directly
check the data. Full encryption with a state-of-the-art cipher (like RSA, or
AES) is the most secure option for securing multimedia data. However, in cloud
environments, data have to be computed/manipulated somewhere on the internet.
Thus, many multimedia applications have been seeking a trade-off in security to
enable other requirements, e.g., low processing demands, and processing and
learning in the encrypted domain, Accordingly, we first focus on compressible
image encryption schemes, which have been proposed for
encryption-then-compression (EtC) systems, although the traditional way for
secure image transmission is to use a compression-then encryption (CtE) system.
EtC systems allow us to close unencrypted images to network providers, because
encrypted images can be directly compressed even when the images are multiply
recompressed by providers. Next, we address the issue of learnable encryption.
Cloud computing and machine learning are widely used in many fields. However,
they have some serious issues for end users, such as unauthorized access, data
leaks, and privacy compromise, due to unreliability of providers and some
accidents.

where each process $X^j=(X_{n,j})_n$ is located at a vertex $j$ of a finite

adopted by an agent $j$ of the network. The interaction among the dynamics of
these processes depends on the weighted adjacency matrix $W$ associated to the

action depends on its personal ""inclination"" $Z_{n,j}$ and on the inclinations
$Z_{n,h}$, with $h\neq j$, of the other agents according to the entries of $W$.

explore the relation between the chemical abundances of their gas and stars
with their dust content and their chemical evolution. The empirical spatially
resolved oxygen effective yield and the gas to dust mass ratio (GDR) across
both disc galaxies are derived, sampling one dex in oxygen abundance. We find
that the metal budget of the NGC 628 disc and most of the M101 disc appears
consistent with the predictions of the simple model of chemical evolution for
an oxygen yield between half and one solar, whereas the outermost region
(R<0.8R25) of M101 presents deviations suggesting the presence of gas flows.
The GDR-metallicity relation shows a two slopes behaviour, with a break at
12+log(O/H)~8.4, a critical metallicity predicted by theoretical dust models
when stardust production equals grain growth. A relation between GDR and the
fraction of molecular to total gas, Sigma(H2)/Sigma(gas) is also found. We
suggest an empirical relationship between GDR and the combination of
12+log(O/H), for metallicity, and Sigma(H2)/Sigma(gas), a proxy for the
molecular clouds fraction. The GDR is closely related with metallicity at low
abundance and with Sigma(H2)/Sigma(gas) for higher metallicities suggesting ISM

suffers from inadequate exploration strategies, sparse reward signals, and
deceptive reward functions. To alleviate these problems, a Population-guided
Novelty Search (PNS) parallel learning method is proposed in this paper. In
PNS, the population is divided into multiple sub-populations, each of which has
one chief agent and several exploring agents. The chief agent evaluates the
policies learned by exploring agents and shares the optimal policy with all
sub-populations. The exploring agents learn their policies in collaboration
with the guidance of the optimal policy and, simultaneously, upload their
policies to the chief agent. To balance exploration and exploitation, the
Novelty Search (NS) is employed in every chief agent to encourage policies with
high novelty while maximizing per-episode performance. We apply PNS to the twin
delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient algorithm. The effectiveness
of PNS to promote exploration and improve performance in continuous control
domains is demonstrated in the experimental section. Notably, PNS-TD3 achieves
rewards that far exceed the SOTA methods in environments with sparse or delayed
reward signals. We also demonstrate that PNS enables robotic agents to learn
control policies directly from pixels for sparse-reward manipulation in both
simulated and real-world settings.

validation of the critical behavior of a system. Long-range spatio-temporal
correlations are fundamental for the spontaneous neuronal activity to be the
expression of a system acting close to a critical point. This chapter focuses
on temporal correlations and avalanche dynamics in the spontaneous activity of
cortex slice cultures and in the resting fMRI BOLD signal. Long-range
correlations are investigated by means of the scaling of power spectra and of
Detrended Fluctuations Analysis. The existence of 1/f decay in the power
spectrum, as well as of power-law scaling in the root mean square fluctuations
function for the appropriate balance of excitation and inhibition suggests that
long-range temporal correlations are distinctive of ""healthy brains"". The
corresponding temporal organization of neuronal avalanches can be dissected by
analyzing the distribution of inter-event times between successive events. In
rat cortex slice cultures this distribution exhibits a non-monotonic behavior,
not usually found in other natural processes. Numerical simulations provide
evidences that this behavior is a consequence of the alternation between states
of high and low activity, leading to a dynamic balance between excitation and
inhibition that tunes the system at criticality. In this scenario, inter-times
show a peculiar relation with avalanche sizes, resulting in a hierarchical
structure of avalanche sequences. Large avalanches correspond to low-frequency
oscillations, and trigger cascades of smaller avalanches that are part of
higher frequency rhythms. The self-regulated balance of excitation and
inhibition observed in cultures is confirmed at larger scales, i.e. on fMRI
data from resting brain activity, and appears to be closely related to critical
features of avalanche activity.

floating-point arithmetic is relatively small, elementary function calls
provide a much richer tradeoff space between accuracy and efficiency.
Navigating this space is challenging. First, generating approximations of

vision challenges our capability to build complex open trustworthy autonomous

It is remarkable that the debate about autonomous vehicles focuses almost
exclusively on AI and learning techniques while it ignores many other equally
important autonomous system design issues. Autonomous systems involve agents
and objects coordinated in some common environment so that their collective
behavior meets a set of global goals. We propose a general computational model
combining a system architecture model and an agent model. The architecture
model allows expression of dynamic reconfigurable multi-mode coordination
between components. The agent model consists of five interacting modules
implementing each one a characteristic function: Perception, Reflection, Goal
management, Planning and Self-adaptation. It determines a concept of autonomic
complexity accounting for the specific difficulty to build autonomous systems.
We emphasize that the main characteristic of autonomous systems is their
ability to handle knowledge and adaptively respond to environment changes. We
advocate that autonomy should be associated with functionality and not with
specific techniques. Machine learning is essential for autonomy although it can
meet only a small portion of the needs implied by autonomous system design. We
conclude that autonomy is a kind of broad intelligence. Building trustworthy

force-free field ($\bigtriangledown\times$ B = $\alpha (r) $ B) with a
specific, prescribed constant $\alpha$ (Lundquist solution), and (ii) with
$\alpha$ as a free constant parameter (Lundquist-alpha solution), (iii) uniform
twist field (Gold-Hoyle solution). We retain only those cases where the impact
parameter is less than one-half the FR radius, $R$, so the results should be
robust (29 cases). The SFR radii lie in the range [$\sim$ 0.003, 0.059] AU.
Comparing results, we find that the Lundquist-alpha and uniform twist solutions
yielded comparable and small normalized $\chi^2$ values in most cases. We then
use Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction to analyze these events further. We then
considered the twist per unit length, $\tau$, both its profile through the FR
and its absolute value. We find $\tau$ to lie in the range [5.6, 34] turns/AU.
The GH model-derived $\tau$ values are comparable to those obtained from GS
reconstruction. We find that twist unit length ($L$) is inversely proportional
to $R$, as $\tau \sim 0.17/R$. We combine MC and SFR results on $\tau (R)$ and
give a relation which is approximately valid for both sets. The axial and
azimuthal fluxes, $F_z$ and $F_\phi$, vary as $\approx 2.1 B_0 R^2
\times10^{21}$ Mx and $F_{\phi}/L \approx 0.36 B_0 R \times10^{21}$Mx/AU. The
relative helicity per unit length, $H/L \approx 0.75 B_0^2 R^3$$\times 10^{42}$
Mx$^2$/AU.

observations of light emission from a distant region of spacetime in general
relativity. The goal is to describe the changes between the measurements of the
light performed by a sample of observers slightly displaced with respect to
each other and moving with different 4-velocities and 4-accelerations. In our
approach, all results of observations can be expressed as functions of the
kinematic variables, describing the motions of the observers and the emitting
bodies with respect to their local inertial frames, and four linear bilocal
geodesic operators, describing the influence of the spacetime geometry on light
propagation. The operators are functionals of the curvature tensor along the
line of sight. The results are based on the assumption that the regions of
emissions and observations are sufficiently small so that the spacetime
curvature effects are negligible within each of them, although they are
significant for the light propagation between them. The new formulation
provides a uniform approach to optical phenomena in curved spacetimes and, as
an application, we discuss the problem of a fully relativistic definition of
the parallax and position drifts (or proper motions). We then use the results
to construct combinations of observables which are completely insensitive to
the motion of both the observer and the emitter. These combinations by
construction probe the spacetime geometry between the observation and emission
regions and in our formalism we may express them as functionals of the Riemann
tensor along the line of sight. For short distances one of these combinations
depends only on the matter content along the line of sight. This opens up the
possibility to measure the matter content of a spacetime in a tomography-like
manner irrespective of the motions of the emitter and the observer.

localization to chaotic dynamics and energy equipartition is found for the

consists of motion estimation module, hierarchical features selection,
independent CF online learning, and adaptive multi-branch CF fusion.
Specifically, the motion estimation module is introduced to capture motion

temporal video. The multi-hierarchical deep features of CNN representing
different semantic information can be fully excavated to track multi-scale
objects. To better overcome the deep feature redundancy, each hierarchical
features are independently fed into a single branch to implement the online

are three most fundamental challenges that highly demand solutions, namely,
expressibility, optimisability, and generalisability. Although there have been
significant progresses in seeking answers using various theories, e.g.
information bottleneck theory, sparse representation, statistical inference,
Riemannian geometry, etc., so far there is no single theory that is able to
provide solutions to all these challenges. In this work, we propose to engage
the theory of differential topology to address the three problems. By modelling
the dataset of interest as a smooth manifold, DNNs can be considered as
compositions of smooth maps between smooth manifolds. Specifically, our work
offers a differential topological view of loss landscape of DNNs, interplay
between width and depth in expressibility, and regularisations for
generalisability. Finally, in the setting of deep representation learning, we
further apply the quotient topology to investigate the architecture of DNNs,
which enables to capture nuisance factors in data with respect to a specific
learning task.

the Galaxy, and their energy densities are comparable to that of the turbulent
interstellar gas. The interaction of CRs and Galactic magnetic fields produces
synchrotron radiation clearly visible in the radio regime. Detailed
measurements of synchrotron radiation averaged over the line-of-sight (LOS),
so-called synchrotron emissivities, can be used as a tracer of the CR density
and Galactic magnetic field (GMF) strength. Our aim is to model the synchrotron
emissivity in the Milky Way using a 3 dimensional dataset instead of
LOS-integrated intensity maps on the sky. Using absorbed HII regions we can
measure the synchrotron emissivity over a part of the LOS through the Galaxy,
changing from a 2 dimensional to a 3 dimensional view. Performing these
measurements on a large scale is one of the new applications of the window
opened by current low frequency arrays. Using various simple axisymmetric
emissivity models and a number of GMF-based emissivity models we can simulate
the synchrotron emissivities and compare them to the observed values in the
catalog. We present a catalog of low-frequency absorption measurements of HII
regions, their distances and electron temperatures, compiled from literature.
These data show that the axisymmetric emissivity models are not complex enough,
but the GMF-based emissivity models deliver a reasonable fit. These models
suggest that the fit can be improved by either an enhanced synchrotron
emissivity in the outer reaches of the Milky Way, or an emissivity drop near
the Galactic center. State-of-the-art GMF models plus a constant CR density
model cannot explain low-frequency absorption measurements, but the fits
improved with slight (ad-hoc) adaptations. It is clear that more detailed
models are needed, but the current results are very promising.

stars are expected to have impact on observables such as the quasi-periodic
oscillation in giant flares and the cooling of inner crust in transient
phenomena. Coupling between Anderson-Bogoliubov superfluid phonon (AB phonon)
in superfluid neutron gas and collective excitations of nuclear clusters is a
key issue. Purpose: We intend to predict the nature of low-lying excitation
modes of superfluid inner crust matter with focus on quadrupole excitations
around a spherical nuclear cluster. We study how the AB phonon of neutron
superfluid and possible quadrupole shape vibration of clusters are affected by
the inhomogeneous structure of inner crust matter. Results: The calculated
results indicate emergence of both AB phonon and quadrupole shape vibration of
the cluster with small mixing between the two collective modes. The quadruple
AB phonon is similar to that in uniform superfluid apart from small admixture
of the shape vibration of cluster. The excitation energy and the collectivity
of the cluster vibration mode shows strong and oscillatory dependence on the
neutron chemical potential (the neutron gas density), leading to softening and
instability in certain situations. This is caused by the resonance shell effect
where unbound but resonant single-particle states of neutrons play a central
role. Conclusions: The AB phonon of superfluid neutron gas and the quadrupole
shape vibration of nuclear cluster coexist in inner crust. The coupling between
the AB phonon and the quadrupole shape vibration is weak. The collectivity of
the quadrupole shape vibration is governed by the resonance shell effect, and
it suggests that emergence of deformed nuclear clusters is possible at any
layer of inner crust.

  We show that such a subgraph (although with quantitatively weaker expansion

  The analysis of the algorithm is complicated by the complex dependencies that
arise between edges and between choices made in different rounds. We sidestep
these difficulties by following the combinatorial approach of counting the

so by a compression argument showing that such random choices can be encoded

groups (clusters) and may be used to make decisions for each point based on its
group. However, this process may harm protected (minority) classes if the
clustering algorithm does not adequately represent them in desirable clusters
-- especially if the data is already biased.
  At NIPS 2017, Chierichetti et al. proposed a model for fair clustering
requiring the representation in each cluster to (approximately) preserve the
global fraction of each protected class. Restricting to two protected classes,
they developed both a 4-approximation for the fair $k$-center problem and a
$O(t)$-approximation for the fair $k$-median problem, where $t$ is a parameter
for the fairness model. For multiple protected classes, the best known result
is a 14-approximation for fair $k$-center.
  We extend and improve the known results. Firstly, we give a 5-approximation
for the fair $k$-center problem with multiple protected classes. Secondly, we
propose a relaxed fairness notion under which we can give bicriteria
constant-factor approximations for all of the classical clustering objectives
$k$-center, $k$-supplier, $k$-median, $k$-means and facility location. The
latter approximations are achieved by a framework that takes an arbitrary
existing unfair (integral) solution and a fair (fractional) LP solution and
combines them into an essentially fair clustering with a weakly supervised
rounding scheme. In this way, a fair clustering can be established belatedly,
in a situation where the centers are already fixed.

different applications and environments. However, the expense and redundancy of
annotation often limits the quantity of labels available for training in any
domain, while deployment is easier if a single model works well across domains.
In this paper, we pose the novel problem of universal semi-supervised semantic
segmentation and propose a solution framework, to meet the dual needs of lower
annotation and deployment costs. In contrast to counterpoints such as fine
tuning, joint training or unsupervised domain adaptation, universal
semi-supervised segmentation ensures that across all domains: (i) a single
model is deployed, (ii) unlabeled data is used, (iii) performance is improved,
(iv) only a few labels are needed and (v) label spaces may differ. To address
this, we minimize supervised as well as within and cross-domain unsupervised
losses, introducing a novel feature alignment objective based on pixel-aware
entropy regularization for the latter. We demonstrate quantitative advantages
over other approaches on several combinations of segmentation datasets across
different geographies (Germany, England, India) and environments (outdoors,
indoors), as well as qualitative insights on the aligned representations.

kinetics of complex multi-well potential energy surfaces in a wide range of
different domains of chemical kinetics spanning combustion, atmospheric
chemistry, gas surface chemistry, solution phase chemistry, and biochemistry.
There are two well-established methodologies for solving the chemical master
equation: a stochastic kinetic Monte Carlo approach and a matrix-based
approach. In principle, the results yielded by both approaches are identical;
the decision of which approach is better suited to a particular study depends
on the details of the specific system under investigation. In this article, we
present a rigorous method for accelerating stochastic approaches by several
orders of magnitude, along with a method for unbiasing the accelerated results
to recover the true value. The approach we take in this paper is inspired by
the so-called boxed molecular dynamics (BXD) method, which has previously only
been applied to accelerate rare events in molecular dynamics simulations. Here
we extend BXD to design a simple algorithmic strategy for accelerating rare
events in stochastic kinetic simulations. Tests on a number of systems show
that the results obtained using the BXD rare event strategy are in good
agreement with unbiased results. To carry out these tests, we have implemented
a kinetic Monte Carlo approach in MESMER, which is a cross platform,
open-source, and freely available master equation solver.

electrical distribution system (EDS), aiming to minimize the power loss or
provide maximum power to the load ends. The piecewise linearization (PWL)
approximation method can be used to tackle the nonlinearity and nonconvexity in
network power flow (PF) constraints, and transform the LPP model into a
mixed-integer linear programming model (LPP-MILP model).However, for the PWL
approximation based PF constraints, big linear approximation errors will affect
the accuracy and feasibility of the LPP-MILP model's solving results. And the
long modeling and solving time of the direct solution procedure of the LPP-MILP
model may affect the applicability of the LPP optimization scheme. This paper
proposes a multi-step PWL approximation based solution for the LPP problem in
the EDS. In the proposed multi-step solution procedure, the variable upper
bounds in the PWL approximation functions are dynamically renewed to reduce the
approximation errors effectively. And the multi-step solution procedure can
significantly decrease the modeling and solving time of the LPP-MILP model,
which ensure the applicability of the LPP optimization scheme. For the two main
application schemes for the LPP problem (i.e. network optimization
reconfiguration and service restoration), the effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated via case studies using a real 13-bus EDS and a real
1066-bus EDS.

owing to the peculiar gauge coupling dependence of the non-perturbatively
generated masses. Hence, if the phenomenological value of the mass of the top

be much larger than $\Lambda_{QCD}$. This feature hints at the existence of new
strong interactions and particles at a scale $\Lambda_T$ of a few TeV. In such

simulations (DNS) lead to a logical and important classification of generic
turbulent boundary layers (TBL), namely Type A,B and C TBL, based on the
distribution patterns of time averaged wall shear stress. Among these three
types, Type A and B TBLs are investigated in terms of its universal statistical
laws of velocity and temperature with independency on both Reynolds (Re) and
Prandtl (Pr) numbers. With reference to the analysis by von Karman in
developing the conventional law of the wall for Type A TBL, the current study
first physically distinguishes the time averaged local velocity scale from the
ensemble averaged velocity scale, and properly defines the TBL temperature
scale based on wall heat flux, similar to the well known frictional velocity
scale based on wall shear stress. The unified law of the wall formulations are
then derived for the inner layer of Type A and B thermal TBLs using these
scales. The formulations are constructed by introducing the general damping and
enhancing functions in inner layer, and further, these functions are extended
to logarithmic coordinate based on the multiscale characteristics of TBL
velocity profiles. The validations of the law are conducted both by the DNS
guided near wall integration of Type B TBL governing equations, which uncovered
the Re and Pr independency mechanisms of the law. The research advances the
current understandings of the conventional TBL theory and develop the complete
analytical forms of law of the wall for Type A and B TBLs, including inner
layer, transition layer, logarithmic layer and wake layer.

The task is challenging since there may be multiple confounding factors, some

estimate the causal effects of interventions where a subset of the covariates

the previous LC clustering approaches inevitably result in either lager number

make the trade-off between variances within a cluster and the number of the

achieve a resolution of 4 au (3.8 mas), an rms noise of 66$\mu$Jy/beam, and
reveal an asymmetric ring between $\sim$20-40 au with largely optically thin
dust continuum emission. This ring is well fit by two concentric and
overlapping Gaussian rings of different widths and a Vortex. In addition, an
unresolved component is detected at a position consistent with the central
star, which may trace the central inner disk ($<$2au in radius). We report a
lack of compact continuum emission at the positions of both claimed
protoplanets. We use this result to constrain the circumplanetary disk (CPD)

b is inconsistent with several planet accretion models, while gas-starved

meshless concepts, which leads to great flexibility and generality of the
solution procedure. The proposed framework is tested on four gradually more
complex contact problems, governed by the Cauchy-Navier equations. First, a
disk under pressure is considered and the computed stress field is compared to
the closed form solution of the problem to assess the basic behaviour of the
algorithm and the influence of free parameters. Second, a Hertzian contact
problem, also with known closed form solution, is studied to analyse the
proposed algorithm with an ad-hoc error indicator and to test both refinement
and derefinement. A contact problem, typical for fretting fatigue, with no
known closed form solution is considered and solved next. It is demonstrated
that the proposed methodology can be used in practical application and produces
results comparable with FEM without the need for manual refinement or any human
intervention. In the last case, generality of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by solving a 3-D Boussinesq's problem of the concentrated normal

author names, title, journal, and year from bibliographic reference strings. To
extract the metadata, the parsers apply heuristics or machine learning.
However, no reference parser, and no algorithm, consistently gives the best
results in every scenario. For instance, one tool may be best in extracting
titles in ACM citation style, but only third best when APA is used. Another
tool may be best in extracting English author names, while another one is best
for noisy data (i.e. inconsistent citation styles). In this paper, which is an
extended version of our recent RecSys poster, we address the problem of
reference parsing from a recommender-systems and meta-learning perspective. We
propose ParsRec, a meta-learning based recommender-system that recommends the
potentially most effective parser for a given reference string. ParsRec
recommends one out of 10 open-source parsers: Anystyle-Parser, Biblio, CERMINE,
Citation, Citation-Parser, GROBID, ParsCit, PDFSSA4MET, Reference Tagger, and
Science Parse. We evaluate ParsRec on 105k references from chemistry. We
propose two approaches to meta-learning recommendations. The first approach
learns the best parser for an entire reference string. The second approach
learns the best parser for each metadata type in a reference string. The second
approach achieved a 2.6% increase in F1 (0.909 vs. 0.886) over the best single

minimum power beamforming wherein $L$ base stations (BSs), each equipped with
$N$ antennas, serve $K$ single-antenna users with specific rate constraints.
This is realized by considering user specific intercell interference (ICI)
strength as the principal coupling parameter among BSs. First, explicit
deterministic expressions for transmit powers are derived for spatially
correlated channels in the asymptotic regime in which $N$ and $K$ grow large
with a non-trivial ratio $K/N$. These asymptotic expressions are then used to
compute approximations of the optimal ICI values that depend only on the
channel statistics. By relying on the approximate ICI values as coordination
parameters, a distributed non-iterative coordination algorithm, suitable for
large networks with limited backhaul, is proposed. A heuristic algorithm is
also proposed relaxing coordination requirements even further as it only needs
pathloss values for non-local channels. The proposed algorithms satisfy the
target rates for all users even when $N$ and $K$ are relatively small. Finally,
the potential benefits of grouping users with similar statistics are
investigated to further reduce the overhead and computational effort of the

accounted for by means of line source terms. However, this model reduction
approach still causes high computational costs, in particular, when larger

consideration of a further model reduction step. Thereby, we homogenize the
fine scale structures of the microvascular networks resulting in a new hybrid
approach modeling the fine scale structures as a heterogeneous porous medium

modeling approaches are compared with respect to mass fluxes and averaged
pressures. The simulations have been performed on a microvascular network that

equality between the functional determinants of the corresponding kinetic
operators and, in particular, it provides a holographic route to their Weyl
anomalies. The heat kernel of a single bulk massive scalar field encodes the
Weyl anomaly (type-A and type-B) coefficients for the whole tower of GJMS
operators whenever they exist, as in the case of Einstein manifolds where they
factorize into product of Laplacians. While a holographic derivation of the
type-A Weyl anomaly was already worked out some years back, in this note we
compute holographically (for the first time to the best of our knowledge) the
type-B Weyl anomaly for the whole family of GJMS operators in four and six
dimensions. There are two key ingredients that enable this novel holographic
derivation that would be quite a daunting task otherwise: (i) a simple
prescription for obtaining the holographic Weyl anomaly for higher-curvature
gravities, previously found by the authors, that allows to read off directly
the anomaly coefficients from the bulk action; and (ii) an implied
WKB-exactness, after resummation, of the heat kernel for the massive scalar on
a Poincar\'e-Einstein bulk metric with an Einstein metric on its conformal
infinity. The holographically computed Weyl anomaly coefficients are explicitly
verified on the boundary by exploiting the factorization of GJMS operators on
Einstein manifolds and working out the relevant heat kernel coefficient.

the placement of a stimulation electrode in the anatomical location that
maximizes efficacy and minimizes side effects. Pre-operative localization of
the optimal stimulation zone can reduce surgical times and morbidity. Current
methods of producing efficacy probability maps follow an anatomical guidance on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the areas with the highest
efficacy in a population. In this work, we propose to revisit this problem as a
classification problem, where each voxel in the MRI is a sample informed by the
surrounding anatomy. We use a patch-based convolutional neural network to
classify a stimulation coordinate as having a positive reduction in symptoms
during surgery. We use a cohort of 187 patients with a total of 2,869
stimulation coordinates, upon which 3D patches were extracted and associated
with an efficacy score. We compare our results with a registration-based method

intraoperative stimulation coordinates as a positive response in reduction of
symptoms with AUC of 0.670 compared to a baseline registration-based approach,
which achieves an AUC of 0.627 (p < 0.01). Although additional validation is

is the introduction of a new algorithm for following mobile monitored

as the aforementioned. The devised technique, called Hot-Cold, is able to
ensure proximity maintenance by the tracking robotic device solely based on the
strength of the RF signal broadcasted by the target to communicate its sensors'
data. Complete geometrical, numerical, simulation, and convergence analyses of
the proposed technique are thoroughly presented, along with a detailed

Hot-Cold compared to the popular concept of trilateration-based tracking.

materials (mainly) via bar driven secular processes, they are structurally and
dynamically distinct from `classical bulges' built in violent merger events. We
use high-resolution GTC/MEGARA integral-field unit spectroscopic observations
of the Sa galaxy NGC 7025, obtained during the MEGARA commissioning run,
together with detailed 1D and 2D decompositions of this galaxy's SDSS $i$-band
data to investigate the formation of its disky (bulge) component which makes up
$\sim 30\%$ of the total galaxy light. With a S\'ersic index $n \sim 1.80 \pm
0.24$, half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.70 \pm 0.43$ kpc and stellar mass
$M_{*} \sim (4.34 \pm 1.70) \times10^{10} M_{\odot}$, this bulge dominates the
galaxy light distribution in the inner $R \sim 15""$ ($\sim 4.7$ kpc). Measuring
the spins ($\lambda$) and ellipticities ($\epsilon$) enclosed within nine
different circular apertures with radii $R \le R_{\rm e}$, we show that the
bulge, which exhibits a spin track of an outwardly rising $\lambda$ and
$\epsilon$, is a fast rotator for all the apertures considered. Our findings
suggest that this inner disky component is a pseudo-bulge, consistent with the
stellar and dust spiral patterns seen in the galaxy down to the innermost
regions but in contrast to the classical bulge interpretation favored in the
past. We propose that a secular process involving the tightly wound stellar
spiral arms of NGC 7025 may drive gas and stars out of the disk into the inner
regions of the galaxy, building up the massive pseudo-bulge.

provides useful information when the precursor contains more than three

phosphopeptide production due to difficulties occurring in the production of
acidic phosphopeptides having more than three positive charges. To increase the
charge state of phosphopeptides, we used dinuclear metal complexes, which
selectively bind to the phosphate group in phosphopeptides with the addition of
positive charge(s). Dinuclear copper, zinc, and gallium complexes were tested
and it was found that the type of metal present in the complex strongly
affected the affinity of the phosphorylated compounds and their ETD
fragmentation. The dinuclear copper complex interacted weakly with the
phosphate groups and ETD-induced peptide fragmentation was largely suppressed
by the presence of Cu2+, which worked as an electron trap. The dinuclear
gallium complex was strongly bound to a phosphate group. However, the ligand
binding to gallium acted as an electron trap and the presence of dinuclear
gallium complex in the precursor for ETD-MS/MS hampered the sequencing of the
phosphopeptides, as in the case of dinuclear copper complexes. In contrast,
dinuclear zinc complexes efficiently bind to phosphopeptides with an increase
in the charge state, facilitating phosphopeptide sequencing by ETD-MS/MS. The
fragmentation of the ligand and peptide backbone in the dinuclear
zinc--phosphopeptide complex were competitively induced by ETD. These processes
are influenced by the ligand structure and so the detailed ETD fragmentation
pathways were investigated using density functional theory calculations.

Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, possibility theory, and set of probability
distributions. The aim of this work is to develop a non-deterministic inference
framework, including theory, approximation and sampling method, that deals with
the inverse problems in which uncertainty is represented using random sets. The
proposed inference method yields the posterior random set based on the
intersection of the prior and the measurement induced random sets. That
inference method is an extension of Dempster's rule of combination, and a
generalisation of Bayesian inference as well. A direct evaluation of the
posterior random set might be impractical. We approximate the posterior random
set by a random discrete set whose domain is the set of samples generated using
a proposed probability distribution. We use the capacity transform density
function of the posterior random set for this proposed distribution. This
function has a special property: it is the posterior density function yielded
by Bayesian inference of the capacity transform density function of the prior
random set. The samples of such proposed probability distribution can be
directly obtained using the methods developed in the Bayesian inference
framework. With this approximation method, the evaluation of the posterior
random set becomes tractable.

(http://sky.esa.int) aims at providing a modern and visual way to access
astronomical science-ready data products and metadata. The main goal of the
application is to simplify the interaction between the scientific community and
the ever-growing amount of data collected over the past decades from the most
important astronomy missions.
  The ESASky concept is to offer a complementary scientific application to the
more-traditional table-oriented exploitation of astronomical data, by allowing
a more natural and visual approach and enabling the exploration of astronomical
objects across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. To fulfill this goal,
ESASky provides a multiwavelength interface to a set of astronomy data from an
increasing number of missions and surveys, with the intention of becoming the
single-point of entry to perform visual analysis and cross-matching among
different energy ranges. A lot of effort has been invested on the design of a
user-friendly, responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI) by the definition and
optimisation of algorithms running behind each visual feature offered.
  In this contribution, we describe in detail the design and solutions adopted
for the technical challenges arising during the development. We present the
data services and features implemented in the latest version of ESASky (v2.1),
including a Mission Planning Tool to support current James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) planning, the possibility to search for observations of Solar System
Objects (planets, comets and moons) taken by astronomy missions, the
integration of the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) publication system
in the ESASky GUI, and the retrieval of metadata and data products available
within a specific region of the sky.

convergence in distribution of the normalized number of occurrences. We

(DR), using an in-pixel chopping technique, is presented. The proposed in-pixel
chopping technique is used to reduce the low-frequency or 1/f noise of the
source follower (SF) in an active pixel sensor (APS), which is a major
component of the temporal noise. A conventional 3T active pixel, with
n-well/p-sub photodiode (PD), is modified to implement a chopper inside a
pixel. A single minimum sized nMOS transistor is used in each pixel, without
much compromising in the fill-factor (FF). Using chopping action the
low-frequency noise of the source follower is modulated to the chopping
frequency (f ch ) which is much higher than the maximum frequency of the input
signal frequency band. The up-converted low-frequency noise is eliminated using
a column level low-pass filter (LPF), in the later stage. The reduction in the
temporal noise also results in an enhanced dynamic range of the image sensor.
In addition, the readout consists of a column level high gain chopper amplifier
also reduces the non-linearity of the source follower. To validate the proposed
technique a prototype sensor consists of a 128x128 sized pixel array with
in-pixel chopping and column level read-out circuitry, is fabricated in AMS

vertical both) with a fill-factor of around 30%. The temporal noise is measured
as 280 uVrms at the chopping frequency (fch) of 8 MHz, which shows a reduction
in the noise power by 11 dB. Due to the reduced noise floor, the dynamic range

refinements and revisions. To support assurance that the system satisfies its
requirements, it is desirable that continuous verification can be performed
after each refinement or revision step. To achieve practical adoption, formal
system modeling and verification must accommodate continuous verification
efficiently and effectively. Our proposal to address this problem is TOrPEDO, a
verification approach where models are given via Partial Kripke Structures
(PKSs) and requirements are specified as Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL)
properties. PKSs support refinement, by deliberately indicating unspecified
parts of the model that are later completed. We support verification in two
complementary forms: via model checking and proofs. Model checking is useful to
provide counterexamples, i.e., pinpoint model behaviors that violate
requirements. Proofs are instead useful since they can explain why requirements
are satisfied. In our work, we introduce a specific concept of proof, called
topological proof (TP). A TP produces a slice of the original PKS which
justifies the property satisfaction. Because models can be incomplete, TOrPEDO
supports reasoning on requirements satisfaction, violation, and possible
satisfaction (in the case where the satisfaction depends on unknown parts).

Nariai-like space-time associated with degenerate horizon, we describe
dynamical behavior of horizon. We show that $f(R)$-gravity can offer both
anti-evaporation and evaporation in $n$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""om black
hole depending on the dimension $n$ and the functional form of $f(R)$.
Furthermore, we argue that, in one class of non-oscillatory solution, stable
and unstable anti-evaporation/evaporation exist. In the other class of
oscillatory solution anti-evaporation/evaporation exists only with instability.
The first class of solution may explain a long-lived black hole.

of false selection (PFS). First, we reveal that for the well-known Optimal
Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) algorithm and its two variants, a constant
initial sample size (independent of the total budget) only amounts to a
sub-exponential (or even polynomial) convergence rate. After that, a
modification is proposed to achieve an exponential convergence rate, where the
improvement is shown by a finite-sample bound on the PFS as well as numerical
results. Finally, we focus on a more tractable two-design case and explicitly
characterize the large deviations rate of PFS for some simplified algorithms.
Our analysis not only develops insights into the algorithms' properties, but
also highlights several useful techniques for analyzing the convergence rate of

improved. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning, we propose to
incorporate representations learnable through computation. We explore
representations of a group nature through unsupervised learning, e.g.,
hierarchical clustering and recursive space partition. Information carried by
clustering or spatial partitioning may be more concrete than the labels when
the data are heterogeneous, or could help when the labels are noisy. The use of
such information could be viewed as regularization in model fitting. It is
motivated by major challenges in TMA image scoring---heterogeneity and label
noise, and the cluster assumption in semi-supervised learning. Using this
information on TMA images of breast cancer, we have reduced the error rate of
TACOMA by about 6%. Further simulations on synthetic data provide insights on
when such representations would likely help. Although we focus on TMAs,
learnable representations of this type are expected to be applicable in other
settings.

Predictions are obtained with a simple model that uses link persistence and
link formation by triadic closure across both financial and social media

floors as well as her floor, she will typically only receive signals from
spatially closer APs in distant floors, as compared to APs in her floor. This
is due to signal attenuation by floors/ceilings along with the 3D distance
between the APs and the user. Hapi leverages this observation to achieve
accurate and robust location estimates. A deep-learning based method is
