that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle. We find that standard behavior
cloning is insufficient for handling complex driving scenarios, even when we
leverage a perception system for preprocessing the input and a controller for
executing the output on the car: 30 million examples are still not enough. We
propose exposing the learner to synthesized data in the form of perturbations
to the expert's driving, which creates interesting situations such as
collisions and/or going off the road. Rather than purely imitating all data, we
augment the imitation loss with additional losses that penalize undesirable
events and encourage progress -- the perturbations then provide an important
signal for these losses and lead to robustness of the learned model. We show
that the ChauffeurNet model can handle complex situations in simulation, and
present ablation experiments that emphasize the importance of each of our
proposed changes and show that the model is responding to the appropriate
causal factors. Finally, we demonstrate the model driving a car in the real

monotone nondegenerate numbering of the two-dimensional lattice~$\Bbb Z^2_+$,
or of a nondegenerate central measure on the space of infinite Young tableaux.
And the third theorem establishes the uniqueness of a representation of the
infinite symmetric group~${\frak S}_{\infty}$ whose restrictions to finite

feature space covered by training, as the SDSS spectroscopic sample is
considerably shallower than KiDS. This gives 3.4 million objects in the final
inference sample, from which the random forest identified 190,000 quasar
candidates. Accuracy of 97%, purity of 91%, and completeness of 87%, as derived
from a test set extracted from SDSS and not used in the training, are confirmed

strengthened by number counts of the quasar candidates in the r band, as well

training and evaluating feedforward neural networks based on the canonical
classical feedforward and backpropagation algorithms. Our algorithms rely on an
efficient quantum subroutine for approximating the inner products between
vectors in a robust way, and on implicitly storing large intermediate values in
quantum random access memory for fast retrieval at later stages. The running
times of our algorithms can be quadratically faster in the size of the network
than their standard classical counterparts since they depend linearly on the
number of neurons in the network, as opposed to the number of connections
between neurons as in the classical case. This makes our algorithms suited for
large-scale, highly-connected networks where the number of edges in the network
dominates the classical algorithmic running time. Furthermore, networks trained
by our quantum algorithm may have an intrinsic resilience to overfitting, as
the algorithm naturally mimics the effects of classical techniques such as
drop-out used to regularize networks. Our algorithms can also be used as the
basis for new quantum-inspired classical algorithms which have the same
dependence on the network dimensions as their quantum counterparts, but with
quadratic overhead in other parameters that makes them relatively impractical.

change point, together with the model parameters. The first employs a least
squares criterion function and takes into consideration the full structure of
the stochastic block model and is evaluated at each point in time. Hence, as an
intermediate step, it requires estimating the community structure based on a
clustering algorithm at every time point. The second method comprises of the
following two steps: in the first one, a least squares function is used and
evaluated at each time point, but ignores the community structures and just
considers a random graph generating mechanism exhibiting a change point. Once
the change point is identified, in the second step, all network data before and
after it are used together with a clustering algorithm to obtain the
corresponding community structures and subsequently estimate the generating
stochastic block model parameters. A comparison between these two methods is
illustrated. Further, for both methods under their respective identifiability
and certain additional regularity conditions, we establish rates of convergence
and derive the asymptotic distributions of the change point estimators. The
results are illustrated on synthetic data.

direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using non-uniform arrays is considered.
The different challenges that are treated include the reduction of the
available degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), the presence of coherent targets, and the
mutual coupling effect in practical antenna arrays. Multi-frequency operation
is exploited to increase the DOFs that are available for DOA estimation using
both high-resolution subspace and sparse reconstruction techniques. In
addition, a sparsity-based interpolation technique is presented to perform DOA
estimation with increased DOFs. Moreover, a DOA estimation approach for a
mixture of coherent and uncorrelated targets based on sparse reconstruction and
active non-uniform arrays under narrowband signal platform is proposed. The
aforementioned approaches deal with ideal operational scenarios. To address a
more practical scenario, various methods for DOA estimation using non-uniform
arrays in the presence of mutual coupling are presented. Extensive numerical
simulations which validate the different proposed methods are also included.

behaviors. To use social networks in a study, their structural properties must
be measured. For offline social networks, the conventional procedure is
surveying/interviewing a set of randomly-selected respondents. In many
practical applications, inferring the network structure via sampling is too
prohibitively costly. There are also applications in which it simply fails. For
example, for optimal vaccination or employing influential spreaders for public
health interventions, we need to efficiently and quickly target well-connected
individuals, which random sampling does not accomplish. In a few studies, an
alternative sampling scheme (which we dub `alter sampling') has proven useful.
This method simply targets randomly-chosen neighbors of the randomly-selected

generalize? Is the method suitable for every social network or only the very
few ones considered so far? In this paper, we demonstrate the robustness of
this method across a wide range of networks with diverse structural properties.
The method outperforms random sampling by a large margin for a vast majority of

sampling over random sampling in practical scenarios, and demonstrate its
accuracy via Monte Carlo simulations on diverse synthetic networks.

presence of these IoT objects is expected in our everyday life. About 20
billion of IoT devices are forecasted to be installed in the next two years.
PLC is a compelling technology that could become essential for certain IoT
applications. For example, sensor nodes and actuators used in the Smart
Buildings domain can be connected through PLC. In this case, the PLC network
will work as a backbone for the in-building communication. PLC systems, in this
domain, will help to solve or reduce the overcrowded-spectrum problem,
exploiting the existing cable infrastructure. Narrow band (NB) PLC is probably
the most suitable type of PLC technology for IoT applications. The main reasons
are: simple hardware, good coverage, appropriate bit-rate and low cost.
Nevertheless, to guarantee reliable connectivity further analysis and
improvements should be done. There are such as signal propagation
discontinuities, high channel attenuation and noise. Despite the fact that PLC
noise is a well-known problem, it still poses several challenges for this
technology. This paper aims at adding some new consideration on this topic.
This paper describes new results on MC NB noise. The MC noise is measured
between the Live-Protective Earth (L-PE) and between Neutral-Protective Earth
(N-PE) pairs (L-PE-N configuration), to exploit the symmetries of the channel.
The analysis in this paper considers the whole PLC NB frequency spectrum that
ranges from 3 kHz to 500 kHz. It considers the noise observed at the two output
ports of a given outlet in an in-building network with three conductors.

tracking system capable of jointly fusing information from as many dimensions
as possible to overcome the resolution limit of each individual dimension.
Through a novel path separation algorithm, mD-Track can resolve multipath at a
much finer-grained resolution, isolating signals reflected off targets of
interest. mD-Track can localize human passively at a high accuracy with just a
single Wi-Fi transceiver pair. mD-Track also introduces novel methods to
greatly streamline its estimation algorithms, achieving real-time operation. We
implement mD-Track on both WARP and cheap off-the-shelf commodity Wi-Fi

dissipative component of dark matter with similar properties to the ordinary
baryons, known as mirror dark matter, may collapse to form massive black holes
during the epoch of first galaxies formation. In this study, we explore the
possibility of massive black hole formation via this alternative scenario. We
perform three-dimensional cosmological simulations for four distinct halos and
compare their thermal, chemical and dynamical evolution in both the ordinary

delayed in the mirror sector due to the lack of $\rm H_2$ cooling and only
halos with masses above $ \rm \geq 10^7~ M_{\odot}$ are formed. Overall, the
mass inflow rates are $\rm \geq 10^{-2}~M_{\odot}/yr$ and there is less
fragmentation. This suggests that the conditions for the formation of massive
objects, including black holes, are more favorable in the mirror sector.

epidemic defined on a configuration model random graph, in which infective

theorems for the final size (number of initial susceptibles that become

proved assuming that the degrees are bounded. The results are obtained for both
the Molloy-Reed random graph, in which the degrees of individuals are
deterministic, and the Newman-Strogatz-Watts random graph, in which the degrees
are independent and identically distributed. The central limit theorems cover
the cases when the number of initial infectives either (a) tends to infinity or
(b) is held fixed as $n \to \infty$. In (a) it is assumed that the fraction of
the population that is initially infected converges to a limit (which may be
$0$) as $n \to \infty$, while in (b) the central limit theorems are conditional

percolation on Molloy-Reed and Newman-Strogatz-Watts random graphs follow
immediately from our results, as do central limit theorems for the size of the

KTNs efficiently transfer convolution kernels from perspective images to the
equirectangular projection of 360{\deg} images. Given a source CNN for
perspective images as input, the KTN produces a function parameterized by a
polar angle and kernel as output. Given a novel 360{\deg} image, that function
in turn can compute convolutions for arbitrary layers and kernels as would the
source CNN on the corresponding tangent plane projections. Distinct from all
existing methods, KTNs allow model transfer: the same model can be applied to
different source CNNs with the same base architecture. This enables application
to multiple recognition tasks without re-training the KTN. Validating our
approach with multiple source CNNs and datasets, we show that KTNs improve the
state of the art for spherical convolution. KTNs successfully preserve the
source CNN's accuracy, while offering transferability, scalability to typical
image resolutions, and, in many cases, a substantially lower memory footprint.

  Deep Generative Models",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In real-world applications, it is often expensive and time-consuming to
obtain labeled examples. In such cases, knowledge transfer from related
domains, where labels are abundant, could greatly reduce the need for extensive
labeling efforts. In this scenario, transfer learning comes in hand. In this
paper, we propose Deep Variational Transfer (DVT), a variational autoencoder
that transfers knowledge across domains using a shared latent Gaussian mixture
model. Thanks to the combination of a semi-supervised ELBO and parameters
sharing across domains, we are able to simultaneously: (i) align all supervised
examples of the same class into the same latent Gaussian Mixture component,
independently from their domain; (ii) predict the class of unsupervised
examples from different domains and use them to better model the occurring
shifts. We perform tests on MNIST and USPS digits datasets, showing DVT's
ability to perform transfer learning across heterogeneous datasets.
Additionally, we present DVT's top classification performances on the MNIST
semi-supervised learning challenge. We further validate DVT on a astronomical
datasets. DVT achieves states-of-the-art classification performances,
transferring knowledge across real stars surveys datasets, EROS, MACHO and
HiTS, . In the worst performance, we double the achieved F1-score for rare
classes. These experiments show DVT's ability to tackle all major challenges
posed by transfer learning: different covariate distributions, different and
highly imbalanced class distributions and different feature spaces.

have now been implemented in many production-level systems. Alarmingly, unlike
other commercial technologies such as operating systems and network devices,
deep learning-based facial recognition algorithms are not presently designed

internal workings of these algorithms are, neural network-based facial
recognition systems are prime targets for security breaches. As more and more
of our personal information begins to be guarded by facial recognition (e.g.,
the iPhone X), exploring the security vulnerabilities of these systems from a
penetration testing standpoint is crucial. Along these lines, we describe a
general methodology for backdooring CNNs via targeted weight perturbations.
Using a five-layer CNN and ResNet-50 as case studies, we show that an attacker
is able to significantly increase the chance that inputs they supply will be
falsely accepted by a CNN while simultaneously preserving the error rates for

lattice equations of motion can no longer be solved by explicit methods, but we
propose an implicit method to overcome this difficulty, which preserves the
relevant system constraints down to arbitrary (tunable) precision. As a first
application we study, in a comoving grid in $(3+1)$ dimensions, the last efolds
of axion-inflation with quadratic potential and the preheating stage following
afterwards. We fully account for the inhomogeneity and non-linearity of the
system, including the gauge field contribution to the expansion rate of the
Universe and its backreaction into the axion dynamics. We characterize in
detail, as a function of the coupling, the energy transfer from the axion to
the gauge field. Two coupling regimes are identified, sub- and super-critical,
depending on whether the final energy fraction stored in the gauge field is
below or above $\sim 50\%$ of the total energy. The Universe is very
efficiently reheated for super-critical couplings, rapidly entering in a
radiation dominated stage. Our results on preheating confirm previously
published results.

timescales, we propose that observations of the Deep Drilling Fields are
acquired in sequences of continuous exposures each lasting 2--4 hours. This
will allow LSST to resolve rapid stellar variability such as short-period
pulsations, exoplanet transits, ultracompact binary systems, and flare
morphologies, while still achieving the desired co-added depths for the
selected fields. The greater number of observations of each Deep Drilling Field
pushes these mini-surveys deep in terms of both sensitivity to low-amplitude
variability and co-added depth. Saving the individual 15-second exposures will
yield an effective Nyquist limit of $\approx0.031$ Hz (32 seconds). Resolved
short-period variability of targets in these fields will aid the interpretation
of sparse observations of a greater number of variables in the main survey. If
this cadence strategy conflicts with the science goals of individual Deep
Drilling Fields, at least a subset of the additional observations of each field
should be obtained continuously. This strategy should also be considered for
the proposed Galactic Plane mini survey, which will observe a greater number of
stellar variables and transients.

astronomical surveys to detect and recognize fast and explosive transients and
fast transient features. Observations in two different filters within a short
time window (e.g., g-and-i, or r-and-z, within < 0.5 hr) and a repeat of one of

evolution of transients on the same night. This allows the identification and
initial characterization of fast transient -- or fast features of longer
timescale transients -- such as rapidly declining supernovae, kilonovae, and
the signatures of SN ejecta interacting with binary companion stars or
circumstellar material. Some of these extragalactic transients are
intrinsically rare and generally all hard to find, thus upcoming surveys like
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could dramatically improve our
understanding of their origin and properties. We colloquially refer to such a

properties can be studied in detail even in quiescence and an extended
monitoring has been carried out to study its long term timing and spectral
evolution. Here, we report the results of new X-ray observations, taken between
September 2017 and April 2018, with XMM-Newton, Chandra and Nicer. We derived a
phase-connected timing solution yielding a frequency derivative of
-9.26(6)x10^-14 Hz s-1. This value is consistent with that measured between
2009 and 2011, indicating that the pulsar spin-down rate remained quite stable
during the long quiescent period. A spectral analysis of all the X-ray
observations taken between 2009 and 2018 does not reveal significant spectral
and/or flux variability. The spectrum of XTE J1810-197 can be described by the
sum of two thermal components with temperatures of 0.15 and 0.3 keV, plus a
power law component with photon index 0.6. We also found evidence for an
absorption line at ~1.2 keV and width of 0.1 keV. Thanks to the long exposure
time of the summed XMM-Newton observations, we could also carry out a
phase-resolved spectral analysis for this source in quiescence. This showed
that the flux modulation can be mainly ascribed to the the warmer of the two
thermal components, whose flux varies by ~45 per cent along the pulse phase.

abundances of up to 24 elements for each of our targets, which range in
temperature from 6000 to 4600 K. The average derived iron abundance for the
three G stars is 0.17+/-0.07 dex, consistent with the 0.12+/-0.04 dex derived
by Boesgaard et al. (2013) for their sample of 11 solar-type Praesepe members,
which included these G stars. To investigate the efficacy of using automated
routines to derive the abundances of cooler main-sequence stars, we compared
the abundances of the K dwarfs to those of the G dwarfs. Our abundances are
consistent to <=0.1~dex for 13 of the 18 elements we report for all five of the
stars, providing more evidence that G and K stars in a given open cluster are
chemically homogeneous. The median difference between the mean G and K stars
abundances is 0.08+/-0.05 dex, despite serious challenges with the noisier data
for the fainter K dwarfs. Our results are encouraging for chemical tagging, as
they indicate that it may be possible to use automated abundance determination
techniques to identify chemically related main-sequence stars across larger

itself that guarantee their output to have a size not exceeding some bound. For
example, d-Set Matching for integers d>2 is the problem of finding a matching
of size at least k in a given d-uniform hypergraph and has kernels with O(k^d)
edges. Bodlaender et al. [JCSS 2009], Fortnow and Santhanam [JCSS 2011], Dell
and Van Melkebeek [JACM 2014] developed a framework for proving lower bounds on
the kernel size for certain problems, under the complexity-theoretic hypothesis
that coNP is not contained in NP/poly. Under the same hypothesis, we show tight
lower bounds for the kernelization of d-Set Matching and other packing
problems.
  Our bounds are tight for d-Set Matching: It does not have kernels with
O(k^{d-{\epsilon}}) edges for any {\epsilon}>0 unless the hypothesis fails. By
reduction, this transfers to a bound of O(k^{d-1-{\epsilon}}) for the problem
of finding k vertex-disjoint cliques of size d in standard graphs. Obtaining
tight bounds for graph packing problems is challenging: We make first progress
in this direction by showing non-trivial kernels with O(k^2.5) edges for the
problem of finding k vertex-disjoint paths of three edges each. If the paths
have d edges each, we improve the straightforward O(k^{d+1}) kernel to a
uniform polynomial kernel where the exponent of the kernel size is independent
of k.
  Most of our lower bound proofs follow a general scheme that we discover: To
exclude kernels of size O(k^{d-{\epsilon}}) for a problem in d-uniform
hypergraphs, one should reduce from a carefully chosen d-partite problem that
is still NP-hard. As an illustration, we apply this scheme to the vertex cover
problem, which allows us to replace the number-theoretical construction by Dell
and Van Melkebeek [JACM 2014] with shorter elementary arguments.

is monotonically increasing and concave in the time allocated for each task,
under explicit minimum and maximum $\textit{utilization}$ constraints. We show
that the optimal solution is to keep the utilization ratio of the operator as
high as possible, and to process all the tasks. We prove that the optimal
policy consists of two major strategies: utilize the operator without resting
until reaching the maximum allowable utilization ratio, and then alternate
between working and resting the operator each time reaching the maximum
allowable utilization at the end of work-period. We show that even though the
tasks are similar in difficulty, the time allocated for the tasks can be
different depending on the strategy in which a task is processed; however, the

neutron star mergers is still uncertain, but only few (less than 15) events
with associated kilonovae may be detectable per year within the horizon of
next-generation ground-based interferometers. The rapid evolution (hours to
days) at optical/infrared wavelengths, relatively low luminosity, and the low
volumetric rate of kilonovae makes their discovery difficult, especially during
blind surveys of the sky. We propose future large surveys to adopt a rolling
cadence in which g-i observations are taken nightly for blocks of 10
consecutive nights. With the current baseline2018a cadence designed for the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), less than 7.5 poorly-sampled kilonovae

about 272 GW170817-like kilonovae throughout the LSST WFD survey, discovered

spin-orbit coupling, we find that to fully suppress the tunneling in the system
the optical lattice shaking is not enough, and a proper tuning of the

This leads to a sequence of Zeeman parameter values where energy bands become
flat, the tunneling in the system is suppressed, and the dynamical localization
phenomenon occurs. Exact wave functions at the dynamical localization points
show that the binary mixture localizes on a dimer with the two components
occupying different sites. This type of localization occurs in exact form also
for the ground state of the system at the dynamical localization points in the

wide range of the Zeeman parameter around these points. The possibility of

collapse has been suggested as a possible channel for binary black hole
formation. Such a scenario could explain the formation of the new population of
massive black holes detected by the LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave laser
interferometers. We probe that scenario by performing general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of differentially rotating massive stars
supported by thermal radiation pressure plus a gas pressure perturbation. The
stars are initially threaded by a dynamically weak, poloidal magnetic field
confined to the stellar interior. We find that magnetic braking and turbulent
viscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in
the bulk of the star redistribute angular momentum, damp differential rotation
and induce the formation of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core
surrounded by a Keplerian envelope. The core + disk configuration evolves on a
secular timescale and remains in quasi-stationary equilibrium until the
termination of our simulations. Our results suggest that the high degree of
differential rotation required for $m=2$ seed density perturbations to trigger
gas fragmentation and binary black hole formation is likely to be suppressed
during the normal lifetime of the star prior to evolving to the point of
dynamical instability to collapse. Other cataclysmic events, such as stellar
mergers leading to collapse, may therefore be necessary to reestablish
sufficient differential rotation and density perturbations to drive
nonaxisymmetric modes leading to binary black hole formation.

particular problem for adiabatic gates, due to their slower speeds. Here, we
propose an adiabatic two-qubit gate for quantum dot hybrid qubits, based on the
tunable, electrostatic coupling between distinct charge configurations. We
confirm the absence of a conventional sweet spot, but show that controlled-Z

typical level of quasistatic charge noise ($\sigma_\varepsilon$$\simeq$1

which the time-averaged energy derivatives are set to zero, and identify a

color-triplets and color-singlets of charges up to |Q|=8, we recast searches
for signatures of two production channels: the ""open"" channel - where the
particles are pair-produced above threshold, and are detectable in dedicated
LHC searches for stable multiply charged leptons, and the ""closed"" channel -
where a particle-antiparticle pair is produced as a bound state, detectable in
searches for a diphoton resonance. We recast the open lepton searches by
incorporating the relevant strong-interaction effects for color-triplets. In
both open and closed production, we provide a careful assessment of
photon-induced processes using the accurate LUXqed PDF, resulting in
substantially weaker bounds than previously claimed in the literature for the
colorless case. Our bounds for colored MCHSPs are shown for the first time, as
the LHC experiments have not searched for them directly. Generally, we obtain
nearly charge-independent lower mass limits of around 970 GeV (color-triplet

fine-tuned in the context of recent swampland conjectures. In particular, the
issue is whether there is a double fine-tuning in which both $V$ and $|\nabla
V|$ are fine-tuned, or whether there is only a single fine-tuning due to the
relation $|\nabla V|\sim V/M_{pl}$ arising naturally. We find that indeed this
relation arises naturally in simple string compactifications for some scalars,
such as the dilaton and volume modulus, when treated classically. However, we
find that quantum effects can spoil this natural relation, unless the scalar is
conformally coupled to the matter sector. Furthermore, it is well known that
such conformal couplings are generically ruled out by fifth force tests. To
avoid these fifth forces, an interesting proposal is to assume the scalar
(quintessence) only couples to the hidden sector. However, we then find quantum
corrections to $V$ from visible sector Standard Model particles generically
spoil the relation. A possible way out of all these problems is to have the
scalar conformally coupled to a dark sector that is an exact copy of the
Standard Model. This ensures the relation $|\nabla V|\sim V/M_{pl}$ is
maintained naturally even when matter particles run in the loop. However, we
find that quantum corrections from quintessons or gravitons in the loop spoil
the relation if the effective theory has a cutoff greater than $\sim 0.1$ GeV.

case in coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD), where ""bottom-up"" methods
need to run expensive atomistic simulations as part of the calibration process.
As a result, scientists have been slow to adopt CG techniques in many settings

coarse-graining rigid-body systems that yields corresponding intermolecular
potentials with controllable levels of accuracy relative to their atomistic
counterparts. Critically, this analysis: (i) provides a mathematical foundation
for assessing the quality of a CG force field without running simulations, and
(ii) provides a tool for understanding how atomistic systems can be viewed as
appropriate limits of reduced-order models. Simulated results confirm the
validity of this approach at the trajectory level and point to issues that must

the other hand, deep-RBF networks assign high confidence only to the regions

the force exerted on a massive and luminous perturber moving at constant speed

the release of energy into the ambient medium by the perturber, or heating
force, is directed along the direction of motion and induces an acceleration of
the perturber. Its value is compared to analytic estimates in the low and high
Mach number limits, and found to match those accurately. In addition, the drag
exerted on a non-luminous perturber significantly departs from the adiabatic
expression when thermal diffusion is taken into account. In the limit of a
vanishing velocity, this drag tends to a finite value which we determine using
linear perturbation theory and corroborate with numerical simulations. The drag
on a non-luminous perturber in a non-adiabatic gas therefore behaves like dry
or solid friction. We work out the luminosity threshold to get a net
acceleration of the perturber and find it to be generally much smaller than the
luminosity of accreting low-mass planetary embryos embedded in a gaseous

fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems involving viscous incompressible
flow and compressible elastic-solids. The AMP scheme remains stable and
second-order accurate even when added-mass and added-damping effects are large.
The fluid is updated with an implicit-explicit (IMEX) fractional-step scheme
whereby the velocity is advanced in one step, treating the viscous terms
implicitly, and the pressure is computed in a second step. The AMP interface
conditions for the fluid arise from the outgoing characteristic variables in
the solid and are partitioned into a Robin (mixed) interface condition for the
pressure, and interface conditions for the velocity. The latter conditions
include an impedance-weighted average between fluid and solid velocities using
a fluid impedance of a special form. A similar impedance-weighted average is
used to define interface values for the solid. The fluid impedance is defined
using material and discretization parameters and follows from a careful
analysis of the discretization of the governing equations and coupling
conditions near the interface. A normal mode analysis is performed to show that
the AMP scheme is stable for a few carefully-selected model problems. Two
extensions of the analysis in Banks et al. are considered, including a
first-order accurate discretization of a viscous model problem and a
second-order accurate discretization of an inviscid model problem. The AMP
algorithm is shown to be stable for any ratio of solid and fluid densities,
including when added-mass effects are large. The algorithm is verified for
accuracy and stability for a set of new exact benchmark solutions where finite
interface deformations are permitted. The AMP scheme is found to be stable and
second-order accurate even for very difficult cases of very light solids.

simultaneous with the last SUZAKU observations ($\sim 50$ ks), of the active
galactic nucleus of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509. The time-averaged
spectrum in the $1-79$ keV X-ray band is dominated by a power-law continuum
($\Gamma\sim 1.8-1.9$), a strong soft excess around 1 keV, and signatures of
X-ray reflection in the form of Fe K emission ($\sim 6.4$ keV), an Fe K
absorption edge ($\sim 7.1$ keV), and a Compton hump due to electron scattering
($\sim 20-30$ keV). We show that these data can be described by two very
different prescriptions for the soft excess: a warm ($kT\sim 0.5-1$ keV) and
optically thick ($\tau\sim10-20$) Comptonizing corona, or a relativistically
blurred ionized reflection spectrum from the inner regions of the accretion
disk. While these two scenarios cannot be distinguished based on their fit
statistics, we argue that the parameters required by the warm corona model are
physically incompatible with the conditions of standard coronae. Detailed
photoionization calculations show that even in the most favorable conditions,
the warm corona should produce strong absorption in the observed spectrum. On
the other hand, while the relativistic reflection model provides a satisfactory
description of the data, it also requires extreme parameters, such as maximum
black hole spin, a very low and compact hot corona, and a very high density for
the inner accretion disk. Deeper observations of this source are thus necessary
to confirm the presence of relativistic reflection, and to further understand
the nature of its soft excess.

we describe the emergence of both properties through an exactly solvable

statistical superposition of a local equilibrium distribution weighted by a
background density, the increments distribution is given by a novel class of
skewed heavy-tailed distributions, written as a generalization of the Meijer

models, such as rigid body equations of motion. However, many control problems
in modern manufacturing deal with contacts and friction, which are difficult to
capture with first-order physical modeling. Hence, applying control design
methodologies to these kinds of problems often results in brittle and
inaccurate controllers, which have to be manually tuned for deployment.
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated to be capable of
learning continuous robot controllers from interactions with the environment,
even for problems that include friction and contacts. In this paper, we study
how we can solve difficult control problems in the real world by decomposing
them into a part that is solved efficiently by conventional feedback control
methods, and the residual which is solved with RL. The final control policy is
a superposition of both control signals. We demonstrate our approach by
training an agent to successfully perform a real-world block assembly task
involving contacts and unstable objects.

parametric sidebands in multimode optical fibers by tailoring their linear
refractive index profile. In all cases, the pump experiences Kerr
self-cleaning, leading to a bell-shaped profile close to the fundamental mode.
Geometric parametric instability, owing to quasi-phase-matching from the
grating generated via the Kerr effect by pump self-imaging, leads to frequency
multicasting of beam self-cleaning across a wideband array of sidebands. Our
experiments show that introducing a gaussian dip in the refractive index
profile of a graded index fiber permits to dramatically change the spatial
content of spectral sidebands into higher-order modes. This is due to the
breaking of oscillation synchronism among fundamental and higher-order modes.
Hence modal-four-wave mixing prevails over geometric parametric instability as
the main sideband generation mechanism. Observations agree well with
theoretical predictions based on a perturbative analysis, and with full
numerical solutions of the (3D + 1) nonlinear Schrodinger equation.

fourth order in perturbation theory, conveniently expressed through a basis of
Galilean invariants that clearly split contributions that are local and
nonlocal in the second derivatives of the linear gravitational potential. In
addition, we consider relevant contributions from short-range nonlocality

sidestep the usual renormalization of bias parameters that complicates
predictions beyond leading order, we recast the bias expansion in terms of
multipoint propagators, which take a simple form in our split-basis with loop
corrections depending only on bias parameters corresponding to nonlocal
operators. We show how to take advantage of Galilean invariance to compute the
time evolution of bias and present results for the fourth-order parameters for

enables us to reduce the growth of noise injection as the number of parties
increases without sacrificing privacy while maintaining a pre-defined rate of

calculated using standard numerical algorithms for block diagonalization. We
also prove a set of performance bounds for multitaper estimators on arbitrary

metal-poor and therefore the WDs in the different building blocks have similar
properties (including present-day luminosity), we find in our models that the
WDs originating from building blocks that have young and/or metal-rich stars
can be distinguished from WDs that were born in other building blocks. In
practice however, it will be hard to prove that these WDs really originate from
different building blocks, as the variations in the halo WD population due to
binary WD mergers result in similar effects. The five joined stellar halo WD
populations that we modelled result in WDLFs that are very similar to each
other. We find that simple models with a Kroupa or Salpeter initial mass

introduces methods for obtaining quantitative morphological features from

images suffer from the artifact that limit quantitative analysis of the vessel
morphological features. In this paper we introduce processing steps to increase
accuracy of the morphological assessment for quantitative vessel analysis in
presence of these artifact. Specifically, artificats are reduced by additional
filtering and vessel segments obtained by skeletonization of the regularized
microvasculature images are further analyzed to satisfy additional constraints,
such as diameter, and length of the vessel segments. Measurement of some
morphological metrics, such as tortuosity, depends on preserving large vessel
trunks that may be broken down into multiple branches. We propose two methods
to address this problem. In the first method, small vessel segments are
suppressed in the vessel filtering process via adjusting the size scale of the
regularization. Hence, tortuosity of the large trunks can be more accurately
estimated by preserving longer vessel segments. In the second approach, small
connected vessel segments are removed by a combination of morphological erosion
and dilation operations on the segmented vasculature images. These methods are
tested on representative in vivo images of breast lesion microvasculature, and
the outcomes are discussed. This paper provides a tool for quantification of
microvasculature image from non-contrast ultrasound imaging may result in

shown to be a significant fraction of the total fluxes within the roughness

the transport of momentum and scalars are found to be similar in general,
albeit with increasing dissimilarity for roughnesses with low frontal blockage.
However, strong dissimilarity is noted between the dispersive momentum and
scalar fluxes, especially below the top of the roughness elements. In general,
turbulence is found to transport momentum more efficiently than scalars, while
the reverse applies for the dispersive contributions. The effects of varying
surface geometries, measured by the frontal density, can be pronounced on both
turbulent and dispersive fluxes. Increasing frontal density induces a general
transition in the flow from a rough boundary-layer type to a mixed-layer-like
type. This transition results in an increase in the efficiency of turbulent
momentum transport, but the reverse occurs for scalars due to reduced
contributions from large scale motions in the roughness sublayers. This study
highlights the need for distinct parameterizations of the dispersive scalar
fluxes and the importance of considering the contrasts between momentum and

create a self-supervised dataset of point correspondences to retrain the

ScanNet, the stability classifier automatically discovers a ranking for
keypoints that are not likely to help in VO, such as t-junctions across depth

Descriptive experimental data on nuclear masses and the prediction of unknown
masses based on residual proton-neutron interactions are a focus in nuclear
physics. The accuracy of the residual interaction determines the accuracy of
the nuclear mass values, so the study of residual interactions is essential.
Before we carry out this study, there are many papers using artificial neural
networks in nuclear physics. But no one uses BP neural network to study
residual interactions. In this paper, we obtained a description and prediction
model for residual interactions based on BP neural network. By combining
experimental values with residual interactions model, we successfully calculate
the nuclear masses of $A\geq100$. Results demonstrate that the differences
between our calculated values and experimental values (AME2003, AME2012 and
AME2016) show that the root-mean-squared deviations (RMSDs) are small
(comparing with AME2003, the odd-A nuclei RMSD and the even-A nuclei RMSD are
112 keV and 128 keV; comparing with AME2012, the odd-A nuclei RMSD and the
even-A nuclei RMSD are 103 keV and 121 keV; comparing with AME2016, the RMSD of
odd-A nuclei and even-A nuclei are 106 keV and 122 keV, respectively). In
addition, we obtained some predicted masses based on AME2003 and AME2012, the
predicted values have good accuracy and compared well with experimental values
(AME2012 and AME2016). The results show that the study of residual interactions
using the proposed BP neural network method is feasible and accurate. This
method is helpful for analyzing and extracting useful information from a large
number of experimental values and then providing a reference for discovering
physical laws and support for physical experiments.

A simple new model is presented here that is formulated with an anisotropic
eddy diffusivity that depends explicitly on the anisotropy of the resolution.
It also performs well, and is remarkable because unlike other LES subgrid
models, the eddy diffusivity only depends on statistical characteristics of the
turbulence (in this case the dissipation rate), not on fluctuating quantities.
In other subgrid modeling formulations, such as the dynamic procedure, limiting

Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based models to representations
resolving at least some scales of turbulence in at least some regions of the

performing large eddy simulation (LES) everywhere, a broad range of hybrid
RANS/LES methods have been developed. While successful in some situations,
existing methods exhibit a number of deficiencies which limit their predictive
capability in many cases of interest, for instance in many flows involving
smooth wall separation. These deficiencies result from inappropriate blending
approaches and resulting inconsistencies between the resolved and modeled
turbulence as well as errors inherited from the underlying RANS and LES models.
This work details these problems and their effects in hybrid simulations, and
develops a modeling paradigm aimed at overcoming these challenges. The new
approach discards typical blending approaches in favor of a hybridization
strategy in which the RANS and LES model components act through separate models
formulated using the mean and fluctuating velocity, respectively. Further, a
forcing approach in which fluctuating content is actively transferred from the
modeled to the resolved scales is introduced. Finally, the model makes use of
an anisotropic LES model that is intended to represent the effects of grid
anisotropy. The model is demonstrated on fully-developed, incompressible

of the polarons results in a polaronic plasmon mode, which is unambiguously
correlated with the surface phonons of SrTiO3 in the presence of the FeSe
films. A microscopic model is developed showing that the interfacial
polaron-polaron interaction leads to the superconductivity enhancement.

world. It is very popular in Eastern and Southeast Asia due to being
aesthetically appealing. Compared with western artistic painting, it is usually
more visually abstract and textureless. Recently, neural network based style
transfer methods have shown promising and appealing results which are mainly
focused on western painting. It remains a challenging problem to preserve
abstraction in neural style transfer. In this paper, we present a Neural
Abstract Style Transfer method for Chinese traditional painting. It learns to
preserve abstraction and other style jointly end-to-end via a novel
MXDoG-guided filter (Modified version of the eXtended Difference-of-Gaussians)
and three fully differentiable loss terms. To the best of our knowledge, there
is little work study on neural style transfer of Chinese traditional painting.
To promote research on this direction, we collect a new dataset with diverse
photo-realistic images and Chinese traditional paintings. In experiments, the
proposed method shows more appealing stylized results in transferring the style
of Chinese traditional painting than state-of-the-art neural style transfer
methods.

response regime due to a double-counting of self-interaction; (iii) by exactly
balancing the effects of self-interaction versus the effects of quantum
fluctuations (and insisting on energy conservation), the Ehrenfest+R approach
generates the correct optical signals in the linear regime and slightly beyond,
yielding, e.g., the correct ratio between the coherent and incoherent
scattering EM fields. As such, Ehrenfest+R dynamics agree with dynamics from
the quantum OBE, but whereas the latter is easily applicable only for a single
TLS in vacuum, the former should be applicable to large systems in environments

Ehrenfest+R approach may be very advantageous for simulating light-matter

technology to rapidly provide wireless connectivity to ground users. Given
UAV's agility and mobility, a key question is how to adapt UAV deployment to
best cater to the instantaneous wireless traffic in a territory. In this paper,
we propose an adaptive deployment scheme for a UAV-aided communication network,
where the UAV adapts its displacement direction and distance to serve randomly
moving users' instantaneous traffic in the target cell. In our adaptive scheme,
the UAV does not need to learn users' exact locations in real time, but chooses
its displacement direction based on a simple majority rule by flying to the
spatial sector with the greatest number of users in the cell. To balance the
service qualities of the users in different sectors, we further optimize the
UAV's displacement distance in the chosen sector to maximize the average
throughput and the successful transmission probability, respectively. We prove
that the optimal displacement distance for average throughput maximization
decreases with the user density: the UAV moves to the center of the chosen
sector when the user density is small and the UAV displacement becomes mild
when the user density is large. In contrast, the optimal displacement distance
for success probability maximization does not necessarily decrease with the
user density and further depends on the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
threshold. Extensive simulations show that the proposed adaptive deployment
scheme outperforms the traditional non-adaptive scheme, especially when the
user density is not large.

step. We present a Generalized Batch Normalization (GBN) transformation, which
can utilize a variety of alternative deviation measures for scaling and
statistics for centering, choices which naturally arise from the theory of
generalized deviation measures and risk theory in general. When used in
conjunction with the ReLU non-linearity, the underlying risk theory suggests
natural, arguably optimal choices for the deviation measure and statistic.
Utilizing the suggested deviation measure and statistic, we show experimentally
that training is accelerated more so than with conventional BN, often with
improved error rate as well. Overall, we propose a more flexible BN
transformation supported by a complimentary theoretical framework that can
potentially guide design choices.

chemical composition in the molecular-cloud scale in the Galactic sources

the 10-pc scale show similar spectral pattern among sources for molecular lines
HCN, HCO$^+$, CCH, HNC, HNCO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, CS, SO, N$_2$H$^+$, and CN. To
constrain the average physical property emitting such spectral pattern, we
model molecular spectra using a time-dependent gas-grain chemical model
followed by a radiative transfer calculation. We use a grid of physical
parameters such as the density $n=3 \times 10^2 - 3\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, the
temperature, $T=10-30$ K, the visual extinction $A_{\rm V} = 2,4,10$ mag, the
cosmic-ray ionization rate $\zeta = 10^{-17} - 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, and the
sulfur elemental abundance $S/H = 8\times 10^{-8} - 8\times 10^{-7}$.
Comparison with the observed spectra indicates that spectra are well reproduced
with the relatively low density of $n=(1-3) \times 10^3\,$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10\,$K,
$\zeta = 10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, and the short chemistry timescale of $10^5$ yrs.
This short chemistry timescale may indicate that molecular clouds are
constantly affected by the turbulence, and exposed to low-density, low $A_{\rm
V}$ regions that ""refreshes"" the chemical clock by UV radiation. The relatively
low density obtained is orders of magnitude lower than the commonly-quoted
critical density in the optically thin case. Meanwhile, this range of density
is consistent with results from recent observational analysis of
molecular-cloud-scale mapping.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, providing new opportunities to escalate
the performance of rapid MRI. In existing deep learning-based reconstruction
methods, supervised training is performed using artifact-free reference images
and their corresponding undersampled pairs. The undersampled images are
generated by a fixed undersampling pattern in the training, and the trained
network is then applied to reconstruct new images acquired with the same
pattern in the inference. While such a training strategy can maintain a
favorable reconstruction for a pre-selected undersampling pattern, the
robustness of the trained network against any discrepancy of undersampling
schemes is typically poor. We developed a novel deep learning-based
reconstruction framework called SANTIS for efficient MR image reconstruction
with improved robustness against sampling pattern discrepancy. SANTIS uses a
data cycle-consistent adversarial network combining efficient end-to-end
convolutional neural network mapping, data fidelity enforcement and adversarial
training for reconstructing accelerated MR images more faithfully. A training
strategy employing sampling augmentation with extensive variation of
undersampling patterns was further introduced to promote the robustness of the
trained network. Compared to conventional reconstruction and standard deep
learning methods, SANTIS achieved consistent better reconstruction performance,
with lower errors, greater image sharpness and higher similarity with respect
to the reference regardless of the undersampling patterns during inference.
This novel concept behind SANTIS can particularly be useful towards improving
the robustness of deep learning-based image reconstruction against discrepancy

reduce or eliminate dispersion of the warped frame elements in the conjugate
variable, making it possible, e.g., to construct frequency warped frames with
synchronous time alignment through frequency. The redressing procedure is
however exact only when the analysis and synthesis windows have compact support
in the domain where warping is applied. This implies that frequency warped
frames cannot have compact support in the time domain. This property is
undesirable when online computation is required. Approximations in which the
time support is finite are however possible, which lead to small reconstruction

providing a reliable monopole component of the effective shell-model
Hamiltonian. To this end, starting from a nuclear potential built up within the
chiral perturbation theory, we derive effective shell-model Hamiltonians with
and without the contribution of the three-body potential and compare the
results of shell-model calculations with a set of observables that evidence
shell-evolution properties. The testing ground of our investigation are nuclei
belonging to fp shell, since the shell evolution towards shell closures in 48Ca
and 56Ni provides a paradigm for shell-model Hamiltonians. Our analysis shows
that only by including contributions of the three-body force the monopole
component of the effective shell-model Hamiltonian is then able to reproduce
the experimental shell evolution towards and beyond the closure at N=28.

the material hardening law has received very limited attention, with isotropic
hardening being the default choice if cyclic loads are absent. The present work
extends the existing studies of monotonic mode I/II steady-state crack
propagation with the goal to compare the predictions from an isotropic
hardening model with that of a kinematic hardening model. The work is conducted
through a purpose-built steady-state framework that directly delivers the
steady-state solution. In order to provide a fracture criterion, a cohesive
zone model is adopted and embedded at the crack tip in the steady-state
framework, while a control algorithm for the far-field, that significantly
reduces the number of equilibrium iterations is employed to couple the
far-field loading to the correct crack tip opening. Results show that the
steady-state fracture toughness (shielding ratio) obtained for a kinematic
hardening material is larger than for the corresponding isotropic hardening
case. The difference between the isotropic and kinematic model is tied to the
nonproportional loading conditions and reverse plasticity. This also explains
the vanishing difference in the shielding ratio when considering mode II crack
propagation as the non-proportional loading is less pronounced and the reverse
plasticity is absent.

In this paper, we propose to ground natural language in an intuitive,
explainable, and composite fashion as it should be. In particular, we develop a
novel modular network called Neural Module Tree network (NMTree) that
regularizes the visual grounding along the dependency parsing tree of the
sentence, where each node is a neural module that calculates visual attention
according to its linguistic feature, and the grounding score is accumulated in
a bottom-up direction where as needed. NMTree disentangles the visual grounding
from the composite reasoning, allowing the former to only focus on primitive
and easy-to-generalize patterns. To reduce the impact of parsing errors, we
train the modules and their assembly end-to-end by using the Gumbel-Softmax
approximation and its straight-through gradient estimator, accounting for the
discrete nature of module assembly. Overall, the proposed NMTree consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-arts on several benchmarks. Qualitative results
show explainable grounding score calculation in great detail.

spread of the use of such models in a large variety of Computer Vision
applications. However, these models are vulnerable to certain inputs, the
adversarial examples, which although are not easily perceived by humans, they
can lead a neural network to produce faulty results. This paper focuses on the
detection of adversarial examples, which are created for convolutional neural
networks that perform image classification. We propose three methods for
detecting possible adversarial examples and after we analyze and compare their
performance, we combine their best aspects to develop an even more robust
approach. The first proposed method is based on the regularization of the
feature vector that the neural network produces as output. The second method
detects adversarial examples by using histograms, which are created from the
outputs of the hidden layers of the neural network. These histograms create a
feature vector which is used as the input of an SVM classifier, which
classifies the original input either as an adversarial or as a real input.
Finally, for the third method we introduce the concept of the residual image,
which contains information about the parts of the input pattern that are
ignored by the neural network. This method aims at the detection of possible
adversarial examples, by using the residual image and reinforcing the parts of
the input pattern that are ignored by the neural network. Each one of these
methods has some novelties and by combining them we can further improve the
detection results. For the proposed methods and their combination, we present
the results of detecting adversarial examples on the MNIST dataset. The
combination of the proposed methods offers some improvements over similar state

the degradation of rolling element bearings (REBs). Therefore, accurately
estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for REBs are of crucial importance
to ensure the reliability and safety of mechanical systems. To tackle this
challenge, model-based approaches are often limited by the complexity of
mathematical modeling. Conventional data-driven approaches, on the other hand,
require massive efforts to extract the degradation features and construct
health index. In this paper, a novel online data-driven framework is proposed
to exploit the adoption of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in
predicting the RUL of bearings. More concretely, the raw vibrations of training
bearings are first processed using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and a
novel nonlinear degradation indicator is constructed as the label for learning.
The CNN is then employed to identify the hidden pattern between the extracted
degradation indicator and the vibration of training bearings, which makes it
possible to estimate the degradation of the test bearings automatically.
Finally, testing bearings' RULs are predicted by using a $\epsilon$-support
vector regression model. The superior performance of the proposed RUL
estimation framework, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, is
demonstrated through the experimental results. The generality of the proposed
CNN model is also validated by transferring to bearings undergoing different
operating conditions.

higher angular momentum Cooper instability. The possibility of topological

previous years. Dormant epicormic buds remain on the surface of trees, pushed
outward from the pith during secondary growth, but maintaining vascular
connections. Epicormic buds can be reactivated, either through natural
processes or intentionally, to rejuvenate orchards and control tree
architecture. Because epicormic structures are embedded within secondary
growth, tomographic approaches are a useful method to study them and understand
their development.
  We apply techniques from image processing to determine the locations of
epicormic vascular traces embedded within secondary growth of sweet cherry
(Prunus avium L.), revealing the juvenile phyllotactic pattern in the trunk of
an adult tree. Techniques include breadth-first search to find the pith of the
tree, edge detection to approximate the radius, and a conversion to polar
coordinates to threshold and segment phyllotactic features. Intensity values
from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the trunk are projected onto the
surface of a perfect cylinder to find the locations of traces in the ""boundary

boundary image by modeling phyllotactic parameters. Our cherry tree specimen
has the conspicuous parastichy pair $(2,3)$, phyllotactic fraction 2/5, and
divergence angle of approximately 143 degrees.

for image processing of volumetric image data in plants. Our results have
practical implications for orchard rejuvenation and directed approaches to
influence tree architecture. The study of epicormic structures, which are

the dynamics of inflation driven by the helicity-0 mode, with a given potential
energy, as well as the evolution of cosmological perturbations, influenced by
the presence of a mixing term between both helicities. In this scenario, the
temporal component of the helicity-1 mode is an auxiliary field and can be
integrated out in terms of the time derivative of the helicity-0 mode, so that
the background dynamics effectively reduces to that in single-field inflation
modulated by a parameter $\beta$ associated to the coupling between helicity-0
and helicity-1 modes. We discuss the evolution of a longitudinal scalar
perturbation $\psi$ and an inflaton fluctuation $\delta \phi$, and explicitly
show that a particular combination of these two, which corresponds to an
isocurvature mode, is subject to exponential suppression by the vector mass
comparable to the Hubble expansion rate during inflation. Furthermore, we find
that the effective single-field description corrected by $\beta$ also holds for
the power spectrum of curvature perturbations generated during inflation. We
compute the standard inflationary observables such as the scalar spectral index
$n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and confront several inflaton
potentials with the recent observational data provided by Planck 2018. Our
results show that the coupling between helicity-0 and helicity-1 modes can lead
to a smaller value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio especially for small-field
inflationary models, so our scenario exhibits even better compatibility with

case, phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (\Phi-OTDR) utilizes
coherent interference of backscattering light along a fiber to achieve
ultra-sensitive acoustic sensing, but sensing locations with fading won't be
functional. Apart from the sensing domain, fading is also ubiquitous in optical
imaging and wireless telecommunication, therefore it is of great interest. In
this paper, we theoretically describe and experimentally verify how the fading
phenomena in one-dimension optical scatters will be suppressed with arbitrary
number of independent probing channels. We initially theoretically explained
why fading would cause severe noise in the demodulated phase of \Phi-OTDR; then
M-degree summation of incoherent scattered light-waves is studied for the
purpose of eliminating fading. Finally, the gain of the retrieved phase

These CRNs may be difficult to integrate into larger systems: if the output of

$\mathcal{C}'$ could inadvertently consume too many outputs before

models. One is a BCS model with separable energy-dependent interactions, the
other - a 2D topological superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and a
band-splitting external field. The long-time quantum quench dynamics at
integrable points of these models are well understood. Namely, the squared
magnitude of the time-dependent order parameter $\Delta(t)$ can either vanish
(Phase I), reach a nonzero constant (Phase II), or periodically oscillate as an
elliptic function (Phase III). We demonstrate that nonintegrable models too
exhibit some or all of these nonequilibrium phases. Remarkably, elliptic
periodic oscillations persist, even though both their amplitude and functional
form change drastically with integrability breaking. Striking new phenomena
accompany loss of integrability. First, an extremely long time scale emerges in
the relaxation to Phase III, such that short-time numerical simulations risk
erroneously classifying the asymptotic state. This time scale diverges near
integrable points. Second, an entirely new Phase IV of quasiperiodic
oscillations of $|\Delta|$ emerges in the quantum quench phase diagrams of
nonintegrable pairing models. As integrability techniques do not apply for the
models we study, we develop the concept of asymptotic self-consistency and a
linear stability analysis of the asymptotic phases. With the help of these new
tools, we determine the phase boundaries, characterize the asymptotic state,
and clarify the physical meaning of the quantum quench phase diagrams of BCS
superconductors. We also propose an explanation of these diagrams in terms of
bifurcation theory.

  Series with Multi-level Attention",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discovering temporal lagged and inter-dependencies in multivariate time
series data is an important task. However, in many real-world applications,
such as commercial cloud management, manufacturing predictive maintenance, and
portfolios performance analysis, such dependencies can be non-linear and
time-variant, which makes it more challenging to extract such dependencies
through traditional methods such as Granger causality or clustering. In this
work, we present a novel deep learning model that uses multiple layers of
customized gated recurrent units (GRUs) for discovering both time lagged
behaviors as well as inter-timeseries dependencies in the form of directed
weighted graphs. We introduce a key component of Dual-purpose recurrent neural
network that decodes information in the temporal domain to discover lagged
dependencies within each time series, and encodes them into a set of vectors
which, collected from all component time series, form the informative inputs to
discover inter-dependencies. Though the discovery of two types of dependencies
are separated at different hierarchical levels, they are tightly connected and
jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. With this joint training, learning of
one type of dependency immediately impacts the learning of the other one,
leading to overall accurate dependencies discovery. We empirically test our
model on synthetic time series data in which the exact form of (non-linear)
dependencies is known. We also evaluate its performance on two real-world
applications, (i) performance monitoring data from a commercial cloud provider,
which exhibit highly dynamic, non-linear, and volatile behavior and, (ii)
sensor data from a manufacturing plant. We further show how our approach is
able to capture these dependency behaviors via intuitive and interpretable
dependency graphs and use them to generate highly accurate forecasts.

three modulation techniques result in a system that can be modeled as an
additive noise channel, and we derive the expression for the probability
density function of the noise. Next, we focus on binary communication and
derive the associated optimal detection rules for each modulation. Since the
noise associated with these modulations has an infinite variance, geometric
power is used as a measure for the noise power, and we derive an expression for
the geometric SNR (G-SNR) for each modulation scheme. Numerical evaluations
indicate that for these systems the bit error rate (BER) is constant at a given
G-SNR, similar to the relation between BER and SNR in additive Gaussian noise
channels. We also demonstrate that the asynchronous modulation based on two
distinguishable particles can achieve a BER performance close to the
synchronized modulation scheme.

complex task in nature to identify a human face by humanoid robots. The recent
literatures on face biometric recognition are extremely rich in its application

second problem in face recognition is the face spoofing, in which a face
recognition system is not able to distinguish between a person and an imposter

ad hoc simulators have been developed for axiomatic memory models. We show how
axiomatic memory models can be simulated using a solver for $\exists$SO.
Further, we show how memory models based on event structures can be simulated
using a solver for MSO. Finally, we present a solver for SO, built on top of
QBF solvers.

  and Bottom-Up for Election",,,,,"cs.MA cs.SI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fuzzy opinion is a Gaussian fuzzy set with the center representing the
opinion and the standard deviation representing the uncertainty about the
opinion, and a fuzzy opinion network is a connection of a number of fuzzy
opinions in a structured way. In this paper, we propose: (a) a top-down
hierarchical fuzzy opinion network to model how the opinion of a top leader is
penetrated into the members in social organizations, and (b) a bottom-up fuzzy
opinion network to model how the opinions of a large number of agents are
agglomerated layer-by-layer into a consensus or a few opinions in the social
processes such as an election. For the top-down hierarchical fuzzy opinion
network, we prove that the opinions of all the agents converge to the leaders
opinion, but the uncertainties of the agents in different groups are generally
converging to different values. We demonstrate that the speed of convergence is
greatly improved by organizing the agents in a hierarchical structure of small
groups. For the bottom-up hierarchical fuzzy opinion network, we simulate how a
wide spectrum of opinions are negotiating and summarizing with each other in a
layer-by-layer fashion in some typical situations.

  Learning Approach","Submitted to Information Science",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Currently, explosive increase of smartphones with powerful built-in sensors
such as GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes and cameras has made the design of
crowdsensing applications possible, which create a new interface between human
beings and life environment. Until now, various mobile crowdsensing
applications have been designed, where the crowdsourcers can employ mobile
users (MUs) to complete the required sensing tasks. In this paper, emerging
learning-based techniques are leveraged to address crowdsensing game with
demand uncertainties and private information protection of MUs. Firstly, a
novel economic model for mobile crowdsensing is designed, which takes MUs'
resources constraints and demand uncertainties into consideration. Secondly, an
incentive mechanism based on Stackelberg game is provided, where the
sensing-platform (SP) is the leader and the MUs are the followers. Then, the
existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) is proven and the
procedure for computing the SE is given. Furthermore, a dynamic incentive
mechanism (DIM) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is
investigated without knowing the private information of the MUs. It enables the
SP to learn the optimal pricing strategy directly from game experience without
any prior knowledge about MUs' information. Finally, numerical simulations are
implemented to evaluate the performance and theoretical properties of the
proposed mechanism and approach.

  Nuclear/Radiological Threats in Commercial Cargo","30 pages, 16 figures, 2 tables","Science & Global Security, vol. 27, no. 2, 2019","10.1080/08929882.2019.1668175",,"physics.soc-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The threat of smuggled nuclear/radiological weapons and material in
commercial containerized cargo remains a significant threat to global security
more than a decade after the enactment of laws in the United States and
elsewhere mandating interdiction efforts. While significant progress has been
made towards deploying passive radiation detection systems in maritime ports,
such systems are incapable of detecting shielded threats or even certain
scenarios in which material is unshielded. Research efforts towards developing
systems for detecting such threats have typically focused on the development of
systems that are highly-specific to nuclear/radiological threats and no such
systems have been widely deployed. While most existing commercially-available
cargo radiography systems are not specifically designed for this interdiction
task, if items resembling nuclear/radiological threats are sufficiently rare in
cargo radiographs to limit false alarms to an acceptably low frequency, then a
smuggling interdiction scheme based on existing technology may be feasible.
This analysis characterizes the relevant nuclear and radiological threats that
may evade detection by passive monitors, and utilizes a dataset of 122,500
stream-of-commerce cargo container images from a 6 MeV endpoint gamma
radiography system to determine the frequency at which objects of similar size
and density to such threats occur in containers. It is found that for a broad
class of threats, including assembled fission devices, gamma radiography is
sufficient to flag threats in this cargo stream at false positive rates of
$\lesssim$2%.

background risk appears. Both the investment risk and the background risk are
probabilistically described by random variables. This paper starts from the
hypothesis that the two types of risk can be represented both probabilistically
(by random variables) and possibilistically (by fuzzy numbers). We will study
three models in which the investment risk and the background risk can be: fuzzy
numbers, a random variabl-a fuzzy number and a fuzzy number-a random variable.
A portfolio problem is formulated for each model and an approximate calculation
formula of the optimal solution is proved.
