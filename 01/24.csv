have been proposed by the HPC and Big Data communities. In this paper, we
investigate three task-parallel frameworks: Spark, Dask and RADICAL-Pilot with
respect to their ability to support data analytics on HPC resources and compare
them with MPI. We investigate the data analysis requirements of Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations which are significant consumers of supercomputing
cycles, producing immense amounts of data. A typical large-scale MD simulation
of a physical system of O(100k) atoms over {\mu}secs can produce from O(10) GB

parallelization of a representative set of MD trajectory analysis algorithms,
in particular the computation of path similarity and leaflet identification. We
evaluate Spark, Dask and RADICAL-Pilot with respect to their abstractions and

  We design novel network architectures to exploit information across multiple

fluorophores, which controls both the beetle's colouration and the fluorescence
emission. An intense two-photon excitation fluorescence signal is observed, the
intensity of which changes upon contact with water. A Third-Harmonic Generation
signal is also detected, the intensity of which depends on the light
polarisation state. The analysis of these non-linear optical and fluorescent
responses unveils the multi-excited states character of the fluorophore
molecules embedded in the beetle's elytra. The anisotropy of the photonic
structure, which causes additional tailoring of the beetle's optical responses,
is confirmed by circularly polarised light and non-linear optical measurements.

data arise in huge amounts, from a wide variety of sources, and traverse a
highly branched path of further processing. To be accepted by its users, an
RDMS must be built around workflows of the scientists and practices and thus
support changes in workflow and data structure. Nevertheless it should
encourage and support the development and observation of standards and
furthermore facilitate the automation of data acquisition and processing with
specialized software. The storage data model of an RDMS must reflect these
complexities with appropriate semantics and ontologies while offering simple
methods for finding, retrieving, and understanding relevant data. We show how
CaosDB responds to these challenges and give an overview of the CaosDB Server,
its data model and its easy-to-learn CaosDB Query Language. We briefly discuss

Despite the presence of Byzantine agents, all the other (good) agents, starting
from possibly different nodes and applying the same deterministic algorithm,
have to meet at the same node in finite time and stop moving. An adversary
chooses the initial nodes of the agents and assigns a different label to each
of them. The agents move in synchronous rounds and communicate with each other
only when located at the same node. Within the team, f of the agents are
Byzantine. A Byzantine agent acts in an unpredictable way: in particular it may
forge the label of another agent or create a completely new one. Besides its
label, which corresponds to a local knowledge, an agent is assigned some global
knowledge GK that is common to all agents. In literature, the Byzantine
gathering problem has been analyzed in arbitrary n-node graphs by considering
the scenario when GK=(n,f) and the scenario when GK=f. In the first (resp.
second) scenario, it has been shown that the minimum number of good agents
guaranteeing deterministic gathering of all of them is f+1 (resp. f+2). For
both these scenarios, all the existing deterministic algorithms, whether or not
they are optimal in terms of required number of good agents, have a time
complexity that is exponential in n and L, where L is the largest label
belonging to a good agent.
  In this paper, we seek to design a deterministic solution for Byzantine
gathering that makes a concession on the proportion of Byzantine agents within
the team, but that offers a significantly lower complexity. We also seek to use
a global knowledge whose the length of the binary representation is small.
Assuming that the agents are in a strong team i.e., a team in which the number
of good agents is at least some prescribed value that is quadratic in f, we
give positive and negative results.

significance of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the dynamics of
oscillating coronal loops. This process enhances the transfer of energy into
smaller scales, and has been connected with heating of coronal loops, when
dissipation mechanisms, such as resistivity, are considered. However, the
turbulent layer is expected near the outer regions of the loops. Therefore, the
effects of wave heating are expected to be confined to the loop's external
layers, leaving their denser inner parts without a heating mechanism. In the
current work we aim to study the spatial evolution of wave heating effects from
a footpoint driven standing kink wave in a coronal loop. Using the MPI-AMRVAC
code, we performed ideal, three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
footpoint driven transverse oscillations of a cold, straight coronal flux tube,
embedded in a hotter environment. We have also constructed forward models for
our simulation using the FoMo code. The developed Transverse Wave Induced
Kelvin-Helmholtz (TWIKH) rolls expand throughout the tube cross-section, and
cover it entirely. This turbulence significantly alters the initial density
profile, leading to a fully deformed cross section. As a consequence, the
resistive and viscous heating rate both increase over the entire loop cross
section. The resistive heating rate takes its maximum values near the
footpoints, while the viscous heating rate at the apex. We conclude that even a
monoperiodic driver can spread wave heating over the whole loop cross section,
potentially providing a heating source in the inner loop region. Despite the
loop's fully deformed structure, forward modelling still shows the structure
appearing as a loop.

angular momentum is removed through magnetised stellar winds. This process is
often assumed to be governed by the dipolar component of the magnetic field.
However, observed magnetic fields can host strong quadrupolar and/or octupolar
components, which may influence the resulting spin-down torque on the star. In
Paper I, we used the MHD code PLUTO to compute steady state solutions for
stellar winds containing a mixture of dipole and quadrupole geometries. We
showed the combined winds to be more complex than a simple sum of winds with
these individual components. This work follows the same method as Paper I,
including the octupole geometry which increases the field complexity but also,
more fundamentally, looks for the first time at combining the same symmetry
family of fields, with the field polarity of the dipole and octupole geometries
reversing over the equator (unlike the symmetric quadrupole). We show, as in
Paper I, that the lowest order component typically dominates the spin down
torque. Specifically, the dipole component is the most significant in governing
the spin down torque for mixed geometries and under most conditions for real
stars. We present a general torque formulation that includes the effects of
complex, mixed fields, which predicts the torque for all the simulations to
within 20% precision, and the majority to within ~5%. This can be used as an
input for rotational evolution calculations in cases where the individual
magnetic components are known.

well-developed topic in the evolutionary computation community. To fill this
gap, we propose a strategy that blends individuals produced by standard
syntax-based GP and individuals produced by geometric semantic genetic
programming, one of the newest semantics-based method developed in GP. In fact,
recent literature showed that combining syntax and semantics could improve the
generalization ability of a GP model. Additionally, to improve the diversity of
the GP models used to build up the ensemble, we propose different pruning

The proposed strategy is contingent upon computing the classifier confusion

classes present in the image to be classified. We provide a procedure to
robustly estimate the confusion probabilities and explore multiple prior

spectra with matched spectral properties or explored correlations between
parameters of broad emission lines, we opted for a non-parametric predictive
approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) to predict the intrinsic
spectrum from the spectral properties at redder (i.e. unabsorbed) wavelengths.
We decomposed a sample of $12764$ spectra of $z\sim2$-$2.5$ quasars from
SDSS/BOSS into 10 red-side ($1280$ {\AA} $<\lambda_{\rm rest}<2900$ {\AA}) and
6 blue-side ($1180$ {\AA} $<\lambda_{\rm rest}<1280$ {\AA}) PCA basis spectra,
and constructed a projection matrix to predict the blue-side coefficients from
a fit to the red-side spectrum. We found that our method predicts the blue-side
continuum with $\sim6$-$12\%$ precision and $\lesssim1\%$ bias by testing on
the full training set sample. We then computed predictions for the blue-side
continua of the two quasars currently known at $z>7$: ULAS J1120+0641
($z=7.09$) and ULAS J1342+0928 ($z=7.54$). Both of these quasars are known to
exhibit extreme emission line properties, so we individually calibrated the
precision of the continuum predictions from similar quasars in the training
set. We find that both $z>7$ quasars, and in particular ULAS J1342+0928, show
signs of damping wing-like absorption at wavelengths redward of Ly$\alpha$.

distributions of the pion are those obtained in a recent calculation in a
Nambu-Jona Lasinio (NJL) framework, with Pauli-Villars regularization. The
scale of the NJL model is fixed by a comparison between NLO predictions based
on NJL evolved pion distributions and rapidity differential DY cross sections
data. The resulting distributions are then used to describe, up to
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, the transverse momentum spectrum of
dilepton pairs up to a transverse momentum of 2 GeV. With no additional
parameters, fair agreement is found with available pion-nucleus data,
confirming the virtues of the NJL description of pion parton structure. We find
sizable evolution effects on the shape of the distributions and on the
generated average transverse momentum of the dilepton pair. We discuss the
possibility of extracting details on pion unpolarized transverse momentum
dependent parton distribution from pion nucleus DY data. In this respect, the
region of low invariant mass of the lepton pair appears to be favored to
discriminate between different descriptions of the non-perturbative pion

present study, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics cosmological simulation to
study the growth of ""normal"" black holes in the high redshift universe. In our
simulation we model the formation of Pop III and Pop II stars along with their
chemical, mechanical and radiative feedback. We consider both UV and X-ray
emission from an accreting BH to simulate its radiative feedback. The selected
halo has a mass of $\rm 3 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$ at $z=7.5$ and we turn on
radiative feedback from a MBH seed of $\rm 10^5~M_{\odot}$ along with in-situ
star formation at $z=12$ when the halo mass reaches well above the atomic
cooling limit. We find that the MBH accretes only about 2200 $\rm M_{\odot}$
during 320 Myr and the average mass accretion onto the MBH is a few times $\rm
10^{-6}~M_{\odot}/yr$. Our results suggest that the stunted growth of MBH is a
consequence of supernovae in tandem with MBH feedback which drive large
outflows and evacuate the gas from MBH vicinity. This may explain why a
population of low luminosity AGN has not been detected so-far at $z>6$; the
large contrast between the star formation rate and the MBH accretion rate may
make then hard to detect even in upcoming deep surveys.

extending the $\phi^4$ field theory of passive phase separation to allow for
all local currents that break detailed balance at leading order in the gradient
expansion. These local active currents, whose form we show to emerge from
coarse-graining of microscopic models, include a mixture of irrotational and

Pastore, Nazer, and Gastpar, this paper studies the potential of structured
nested coset coding as a complete replacement for random coding in network
information theory. The roles of two techniques used in nested coset coding to
generate nonuniform codewords, namely, shaping and channel transformation, are
clarified and illustrated via the simple example of the two-sender multiple
access channel. While individually deficient, the optimal combination of
shaping and channel transformation is shown to achieve the same performance as
traditional random codes for the general two-sender multiple access channel.
The achievability proof of the capacity region is extended to the multiple
access channels with more than two senders, and with one or more receivers. A
quantization argument consistent with the construction of nested coset codes is
presented to prove achievability for their Gaussian counterparts. These results
open up new possibilities of utilizing nested coset codes with the same
generator matrix for a broader class of applications.

that can enhance polysaccharide depolymerization through an oxidative mechanism
and hence boost generation of biofuel from e.g. cellulose. By employing density
functional theory in a combination of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics
(QM/MM), we report a complete description of the molecular mechanism of LPMOs.
The QM/MM scheme allows us to describe all reaction steps with a detailed
protein environment and we show that this is necessary. Several active species
capable of abstracting a hydrogen from the substrate have been proposed
previously. We investigate previously suggested paths as well as new ones. We
describe the generation of the reactive intermediates, the abstraction of a
hydrogen atom from the polysaccharide substrate, as well as the final
recombination step in which OH is transferred back to the substrate. We show
that a superoxo [CuO2]+ complex can be protonated by a nearby histidine residue
(suggested by recent mutagenesis studies and crystallographic work) and,
provided an electron source is available, leads to formation of an oxyl-complex
after cleavage of the O-O bond and dissociation of water. The oxyl complex
either reacts with the substrate or is further protonated to a hydroxyl
complex. Both the oxyl and hydroxyl complexes are also readily generated from a
reaction with H2O2. The C-H abstraction by the oxyl and hydroxy complexes is
overall favorable with activation barriers of 69 and 94 kJ/mol, compared to the
much higher barrier (156 kJ/mol) obtained for the copper-superoxo species. We
obtain good structural agreement for intermediates for which structural data
are available and the estimated reaction energies agree with experimental rate
constants. Thus, our suggested mechanism is the most complete to date and
concur with available experimental evidence.

expressed in terms of Fourier's law and the radiation is considered to be of
the diffusion type for an optically thick grey gas model. The thermal
conductivity and the absorption coefficient are assumed to vary with
temperature and density according to power law. The density and magnetic field
ahead of the shock front, are assumed to vary as an exponential law. The
effects of the variation of the strength of ambient magnetic field, heat
transfer parameters, adiabatic exponent, ambient density variation index on the
shock strength, the distance between the piston and the shock front, and on the

strength decreases by increasing the strength of ambient magnetic field but it
is independent from the heat transfer parameters. The total energy of the flow
field behind the shock front is not constant but varies as power of shock
radius. The compressibility of the medium is increased in the non-magnetic
field. Also, the presence of the magnetic field have significant effects on the

in the well-established softmax loss function to maximize class separability.
In this paper, we first introduce an Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace),
which not only has a clear geometric interpretation but also significantly
enhances the discriminative power. Since ArcFace is susceptible to the massive
label noise, we further propose sub-center ArcFace, in which each class
contains $K$ sub-centers and training samples only need to be close to any of
the $K$ positive sub-centers. Sub-center ArcFace encourages one dominant
sub-class that contains the majority of clean faces and non-dominant
sub-classes that include hard or noisy faces. Based on this self-propelled
isolation, we boost the performance through automatically purifying raw web
faces under massive real-world noise. Besides discriminative feature embedding,
we also explore the inverse problem, mapping feature vectors to face images.
Without training any additional generator or discriminator, the pre-trained
ArcFace model can generate identity-preserved face images for both subjects
inside and outside the training data only by using the network gradient and
Batch Normalization (BN) priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArcFace
can enhance the discriminative feature embedding as well as strengthen the
generative face synthesis.

incorporate query relevance into a pre-trained abstractive model; (b) since
existing abstractive models are trained in a single-document setting, we design
an iterated method to embed abstractive models within the multi-document
requirement of QFS; (c) the abstractive models we adapt are trained to generate
text of specific length (about 100 words), while we aim at generating output of
a different size (about 250 words); we design a way to adapt the target size of
the generated summaries to a given size ratio. We compare our method (Relevance

combine abstractive models on the DUC QFS datasets and demonstrate solid

of a chiral prism: An incident monochromatic wave can split into three waves
propagating with different wave numbers, depending on its chirality and
polarization (right $\&$ left circular polarizations and linear polarization
along the propagating direction). The helicity of the propagating/reflected
light is determined by $\textbf{B}_{ext}$ and $\textbf{E}_{light}$, where
$\textbf{B}_{ext}$ is the gradient of the $\theta-$field in the axion term
given by the applied magnetic field and $\textbf{E}_{light}$ is the

of the external magnetic field controls the Faraday/Kerr rotation. In
particular, we find that the linear polarization of the oscillating electric
field along the propagating direction, which cannot occur in conventional
metals, arises when Weyl nodes are aligned along the oscillating magnetic
field. We evaluate both transmission/reflection coefficients and Faraday/Kerr
rotation angles as a function of both an external magnetic field and frequency

law dependences between the flare energy and the time interval between flares.
Various models have been proposed to explain these dependences, and to explain
the numerical value of the power law indices. Here, we propose a model in which
convective flows in granules force the foot-points of coronal magnetic loops,
which are frozen-in to photospheric gas, to undergo a random walk. In certain
conditions, this can lead to a twist in the loop, which drives the loop
unstable if the twist exceeds a critical value. The possibility that a solar
flare is caused by such a twist-induced instability in a loop has been in the
literature for decades. Here, we quantify the process in an approximate way
with a view to replicating the power-law index. We find that, for relatively
small flares, the random walk twisting model leads to a rather steep power law
slope which agrees very well with the index derived from a sample of 56,000+
solar X-ray flares reported by the GOES satellites. For relatively large
flares, we find that the slope of the power law is shallower. The empirical
power law slopes reported for flare stars also have a range which overlaps with
the slopes obtained here. We suggest that in the coolest stars, a significant
change in slope should occur when the frozen-flux assumption breaks down due to
low electrical conductivity.

impurity scattering and thus is a smoking gun for magnetized 2D Dirac fermions.
Furthermore, we unveil a robust skew scattering mechanism, modulated by the

1-8 Gyr, these white dwarfs are among the oldest stellar remnants in the Milky

a dependency of a molecular cloud's star formation rate (SFR) on its dense gas
mass. In external galaxies, such measurements are derived from HCN(1-0)
observations, usually encompassing many Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) at once.
The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is a unique laboratory to study the relation of the
SFR and HCN emission down to GMC scales at solar-like metallicities. In this
work, we correlate our composite SFR determinations with archival HCN, HCO$^+$,
and CO observations, resulting in a sample of nine reasonably representative
GMCs. We find that, at the scale of individual clouds, it is important to take
into account both obscured and unobscured star formation to determine the SFR.
When correlated against the dense-gas mass from HCN, we find that the SFR is
low, in spite of these refinements. We nevertheless retrieve an SFR - dense-gas
mass correlation, confirming that these SFR tracers are still meaningful on GMC
scales. The correlation improves markedly when we consider the HCN/CO ratio
instead of HCN by itself. This nominally indicates a dependency of the SFR on
the dense-gas fraction, in contradiction to local studies. However, we
hypothesize that this partly reflects the limited dynamic range in dense-gas
mass, and partly that the ratio of single-pointing HCN and CO measurements may
be less prone to systematics like sidelobes. In this case, the HCN/CO ratio
would importantly be a better empirical measure of the dense-gas content
itself.

for AGN power) and the star formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies has
recently been attributed to stochastic AGN variability. Studies using
population synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad,
universal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability
distribution for AGN specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of $L_X$ to
host stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington ratio). However, recent studies
have demonstrated that this universal Eddington ratio distribution fails to
reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions beyond z$\sim$1.2.
Furthermore, empirical studies have recently shown that the Eddington ratio
distribution may instead depend upon host galaxy properties, such as SFR and/or
stellar mass. To investigate this further we develop a population synthesis
model in which the Eddington ratio distribution is different for star-forming
and quiescent host galaxies. We show that, although this model is able to
reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions out to z$\sim$2, it fails to
simultaneously reproduce the observed flat relationship between SFR and X-ray
luminosity. We can solve this, however, by incorporating a mass dependency in
the AGN Eddington ratio distribution for star-forming host galaxies. Overall,
our models indicate that a relative suppression of low Eddington ratios
($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\lesssim$0.1) in lower mass galaxies (M<$10^{10-11}$Msun) is
required to reproduce both the observed X-ray luminosity functions and the
observed flat SFR/X-ray relationship.

truncate discs and produce multiple systems. Discs may be destroyed in
dynamical encounters and/or through ram-pressure stripping, but reform by later

protostellar ages up to $\approx 10^5$ yrs. For low-mass protostars, disc
masses tend to increase with both age and protostellar mass. Disc radii range
from of order ten to a few hundred au, grow in size on timescales $\le 10^4$
yr, and are smaller around lower-mass protostars. The radial surface density
profiles of isolated protostellar discs are flatter than the minimum mass solar
nebula model, typically scaling as $\Sigma \propto r^{-1}$. Disc to protostar
mass ratios rarely exceed two, with a typical range of $M_{\rm d}/M_* = 0.1-1$

work, we combine literature photochemistry models with simple equilibrium
chemistry calculations to place constraints on the plausible range of
concentrations of sulfidic anions (HS$^-$, HSO$_3^{-}$, SO$_3^{2-}$) available
in surficial aquatic reservoirs on early Earth due to outgassing of SO$_2$ and
H$_2$S and their dissolution into small shallow surface water reservoirs like

In general, epochs of moderately high volcanism could have been especially

spaces. It encodes the hidden deformation-theoretic informations of the
underlying classical moduli space. The main tool in our construction is the
representability theorem in derived analytic geometry, which has been
established in our previous work. The representability theorem provides us
sufficient and necessary conditions for an analytic moduli functor to possess
the structure of a derived analytic stack. In order to verify the conditions of
the representability theorem, we prove several general results in the context
of derived non-archimedean analytic geometry: derived Tate acyclicity,
projection formula, and proper base change. These results also deserve
independent interest themselves. Our main motivation comes from non-archimedean
enumerative geometry. In our subsequent works, we will apply the derived
mapping stacks to obtain non-archimedean analytic Gromov-Witten invariants.

phase structure wherein their entire many-body spectrum is characterized by
various types of quantum order, usually restricted to quantum ground states.
After introducing many-body localization and explaining how it can protect

screened Coulomb interactions that decay with a power-law exponent l>5. We
apply the theory to the angle-resolved photo-electron spectroscopy (ARPES) in

In this problem there are $K$ users each caching $M$ files out of a library of
$N$ total files. The question is to minimize $R$, the number of broadcast
transmissions to satisfy all the user demands. Decentralized schemes allow the
creation of each cache independently, allowing users to join or leave without
dependencies. Previous work showed that to achieve a coding gain $g$, i.e. $R
\leq K (1-M/N)/g$ transmissions, each file has to be divided into number of
subpackets that is exponential in $g$.
  In this work we propose a simple translation scheme that converts any
constant rate centralized scheme into a random decentralized placement scheme
that guarantees a target coding gain of $g$. If the file size in the original
constant rate centralized scheme is subexponential in $K$, then the file size
for the resulting scheme is subexponential in $g$. When new users join, the
rest of the system remains the same. However, we require an additional
communication overhead of $O(\log K)$ bits to determine the new user's cache
state. We also show that the worst-case rate guarantee degrades only by a
constant factor due to the dynamics of user arrival and departure.

seq2seq models. These models generate text by sampling words sequentially, with
each word conditioned on the previous word, and are state-of-the-art for
several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are
often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure
of the quality of the generated text. Additionally, these models are typically
trained via maxi- mum likelihood and teacher forcing. These methods are
well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality

never been observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality
using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explicitly train the
generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in
image generation. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable

validation perplexity alone is not indicative of the quality of text generated

the Magellanic Cloud system (VMC). The data analyzed here corresponds to one
VMC tile and covers a total sky area of 1.77 deg^2. Absolute proper motions
with respect to ~9070 background galaxies are calculated from a linear
regression model applied to the stellar positions in 11 epochs in the Ks

Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC5) which includes data from the

proper motion of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d) = (+5.30 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys),
-2.70 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys)) mas/yr. The values derived from the VMC

measurements obtained using HST. We combined our results with literature radial
velocity measurements and reconstructed the orbit of 47 Tuc, finding that the
cluster is on a low-ellipticity orbit and is confined within the inner ~7.5 kpc
of the Galaxy. We show that the use of an increased time baseline combined with

accuracy of the method. In future works, we will apply this method to more VMC

defenses---attacks are feasible and thus defenses are required only when the
vehicle's ignition is turned on---does not hold. We verify this fact by
discovering and applying two new practical and important attacks: battery-drain
and Denial-of-Body-control (DoB). The former can drain the vehicle battery
while the latter can prevent the owner from starting or even opening/entering
his car, when either or both attacks are mounted with the ignition off. We
first analyze how operation (e.g., normal, sleep, listen) modes of ECUs are
defined in various in-vehicle network standards and how they are implemented in
the real world. From this analysis, we discover that an adversary can exploit
the wakeup function of in-vehicle networks---which was originally designed for
enhanced user experience/convenience (e.g., remote diagnosis, remote
temperature control)---as an attack vector. Ironically, a core battery-saving
feature in in-vehicle networks makes it easier for an attacker to wake up ECUs
and, therefore, mount and succeed in battery-drain and/or DoB attacks. Via
extensive experimental evaluations on various real vehicles, we show that by
mounting the battery-drain attack, the adversary can increase the average
battery consumption by at least 12.57x, drain the car battery within a few
hours or days, and therefore immobilize/cripple the vehicle. We also
demonstrate the proposed DoB attack on a real vehicle, showing that the
attacker can cut off communications between the vehicle and the driver's key
fob by indefinitely shutting down an ECU, thus making the driver unable to
start and/or even enter the car.

tools to measure the reputation of entities online, such as politicians or
companies. In practice, current ORM methods are constrained to the generation
of data analytics reports, which aggregate statistics of popularity and
sentiment on social media. We argue that this format is too restrictive as end
users often like to have the flexibility to search for entity-centric
information that is not available in predefined charts. As such, we propose the
inclusion of entity retrieval capabilities as a first step towards the
extension of current ORM capabilities. However, an entity's reputation is also
influenced by the entity's relationships with other entities. Therefore, we
address the problem of Entity-Relationship (E-R) retrieval in which the goal is
to search for multiple connected entities. This is a challenging problem which
traditional entity search systems cannot cope with. Besides E-R retrieval we
also believe ORM would benefit of text-based entity-centric prediction
capabilities, such as predicting entity popularity on social media based on
news events or the outcome of political surveys. However, none of these tasks
can provide useful results if there is no effective entity disambiguation and
sentiment analysis tailored to the context of ORM. Consequently, this thesis
address two computational problems in Online Reputation Monitoring: Entity
Retrieval and Text Mining. We researched and developed methods to extract,

important constraints on galaxy formation models, particularly on small spatial
scales (<1kpc). We have designed the RSS Imaging spectroscopy Nearby Galaxy
Survey (RINGS) to target a sample of 19 nearby spiral galaxies. For each of
these galaxies, we are obtaining and modeling Halpha and H1~21~cm spectroscopic
data as well as multi-band photometric data. We intend to use these models to
explore the underlying structure and evolution of these galaxies in a
cosmological context, as well as whether the predictions of LCDM are consistent
with the mass distributions of these galaxies. In this paper, we present
spectroscopic imaging data for 14 of the RINGS galaxies observed with the
medium spectral resolution Fabby-Perot etalon on the Southern African Large
Telescope. From these observations, we derive high spatial resolution line of
sight velocity fields of the Halpha line of excited hydrogen, as well as maps
and azimuthally averaged profiles of the integrated Halpha and [NII] emission
and oxygen abundances. We then model these kinematic maps with axisymmetric
models, from which we extract rotation curves and projection geometries for
these galaxies. We show that our derived rotation curves agree well with other
determinations and the similarity of the projection angles with those derived
from our photometric images argues against these galaxies having intrinsically
oval disks.

However, these planets are likely to be tidally locked to their host stars and
may not generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields to emit electron cyclotron
maser emission at the low frequencies used in observations (typically >150
MHz). In comparison, the large mass-loss rates of evolved stars could enable
exoplanets at larger orbital distances to emit detectable radio emission. Here,
we first show that the large ionized mass-loss rates of certain evolved stars
relative to the solar value could make them detectable with the Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR) at 150 MHz ($\lambda$ = 2 m), provided they have surface magnetic
field strengths >50 G. We then report radio observations of three long period

However, the band flux density is confirmed and fixed in the process of

model of stellar spectral flux density is established based on basic physical
parameters which are effective temperature and angular parameter. The
stochastic particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to address this

catalogues are studied and consist of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre
Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),
Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The

temperatures and angular parameters are inversed using the given flux densities
according to SPSO algorithm. Then the flux density is calculated according to
Planck's law on the basis of stellar effective temperatures and angular
parameters. The calculated flux density is compared with the given value from
catalogues. It is found that the inversion results are in good agreement for
all bands of the MSX and 2MASS catalogues, whereas they do not agree well in
some bands of the LAMOST and WISE catalogues. Based on the results, data from

possible asymmetry in the supernova explosions and the yields that best-fit the

predominantly best-fitted with the supernova yields with initial masses $M<40

$M=25 M_\odot$ hypernova ($E_{51}=10$) models. The results also indicate that
the majority of the primordial supernovae have ejected $10^{-2}-10^{-1}
M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni leaving behind a compact remnant, either a neutron star
or a black hole, with mass in a range of $\sim 1.5-5 M_{\odot}$. The results
suggest that the masses of the first stars responsible for the first
metal-enrichment are predominantly $< 40 M_{\odot}$. This implies that the
higher mass first stars were either less abundant or directly collapsing into a
blackhole without ejecting heavy elements or that a supernova explosion of a
higher-mass first star inhibits the formation of the next generation of
low-mass stars at [Fe/H]$<-3$.

regularization of the MCD, which is the first general method for minimizing a

we also discuss the robustness of the MCD with respect to computational errors,
possible step size rules, and a choice of parameters of the algorithm. In the
end of the paper we estimate the rate of convergence of the MCD for a class of

inclusion $ T^{(m)}T^{(n)}\subseteq T^{(m+n-1)}$ for an associative algebra $A$
of rank $3$, where $T^{(n)}=T^{(n)}(A)$ is a T-ideal of $A$ generated by the
commutator $[x_1,\dots, x_n]$; the restriction on rank is essential. Further,
we describe 3-variable identities of the algebra $F^{(n)}$. In particular, the
obtained description implies that $Z(F^{(n)}_r)=(T^{(n-1)}+Z_q)(F^{(n)}_r)$,
where $p=\mathrm{char}(K)\geqslant 5$ and $q$ is a least power of $p$ such that
$q\geqslant n-1$ and $Z_q$ is a T-space generated by $x^q$. We also prove the
equality $Z(F^{(n)}_2)=F^{(n)}_2\cap Z(F^{(n)})$. Finally, we obtain certain
generalizations and refinements of some results by A. V. Grishin and V. V.
Shchigolev, respectively. For example, we prove that a unital algebra
$F^{(n)}_2$ $(n\geqslant 4)$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $p\geqslant n$
possesses a finite strictly descending ""composition"" series of T-ideals
$T^{(3)}=T_1\supset T_2\supset \dots \supset T_k\supset T_{k+1}=0$ such that
each quotient $T_i/T_{i+1}$ does not contain any proper T-spaces.

representations learned by NMT models on morphological and syntactic tasks. In
this paper, we investigate the representations learned at different layers of
NMT encoders. We train NMT systems on parallel data and use the trained models
to extract features for training a classifier on two tasks: part-of-speech and
semantic tagging. We then measure the performance of the classifier as a proxy
to the quality of the original NMT model for the given task. Our quantitative
analysis yields interesting insights regarding representation learning in NMT
models. For instance, we find that higher layers are better at learning
semantics while lower layers tend to be better for part-of-speech tagging. We
also observe little effect of the target language on source-side
representations, especially with higher quality NMT models.

introduce the \textit{kinematic concentration} parameter, $c_k$, the ratio
between the global and local degree of energy equipartition reached by a
cluster, and show through extensive direct $N$-body simulations that clusters
approaching core collapse and in the post-core collapse phase are strictly
characterized by $c_k>1$. The kinematic concentration provides a suitable
diagnostic to identify core-collapsed clusters, independent from any other
previous methods based on photometry. We also explore the effects of incomplete
radial and stellar mass coverage on the calculation of $c_k$ and find that our
method can be applied to state-of-art kinematic datasets.

simple mixture of two colloidal and one non-adsorbing polymer species which can

effective colloid-colloid interactions depend on the polymer concentration. We
show that this basic system exhibits surprisingly rich phase behaviour. In
particular, we enquire whether such a system features only a liquid-vapor phase
separation (as in one-component colloid-polymer mixtures) or whether,
additionally, liquid-liquid demixing of two colloidal phases can occur.
Particle-resolved experiments show demixing-like behaviour, but when combined
with bespoke Monte Carlo simulations, this proves illusory, and we reveal that
only a single liquid-vapor transition occurs. Progressive migration of the
small particles to the liquid phase as the polymer concentration increases
gives rise to composition inversion - a maximum in the large particle
concentration in the liquid phase. Near criticality the density fluctuations
are found to be dominated by the larger colloids.

available, it is common to divide time in epochs, i.e. smaller time intervals
and deal with short time series in the hope to have some form of approximate
stationarity on that time scale. We can then study time evolution by looking at
properties as a function of the epochs. This leads to singular correlation
matrices and thus poor statistics. In the present paper, we propose an ensemble
technique to deal with a large set of short time series without any
consideration of non-stationarity. Given a singular data matrix, we randomly
select subsets of time series and thus create an ensemble of non-singular
correlation matrices. As the selection possibilities are binomially large, we
will obtain good statistics for eigenvalues of correlation matrices, which are
typically not independent. Once we defined the ensemble, we analyze its
behavior for constant and block-diagonal correlations and compare numerics with
analytic results for the corresponding correlated Wishart ensembles. We discuss
differences resulting from spurious correlations due to repetitive use of
time-series. The usefulness of this technique should extend beyond the
stationary case if, on the time scale of the epochs, we have quasi-stationarity
at least for most epochs.

capable of leveraging spatially-local correlation in data represented densely
in grids (e.g. images). However, point clouds are irregular and unordered, thus
directly convolving kernels against features associated with the points, will
result in desertion of shape information and variance to point ordering. To
address these problems, we propose to learn an $\mathcal{X}$-transformation
from the input points, to simultaneously promote two causes. The first is the
weighting of the input features associated with the points, and the second is
the permutation of the points into a latent and potentially canonical order.
Element-wise product and sum operations of the typical convolution operator are
subsequently applied on the $\mathcal{X}$-transformed features. The proposed
method is a generalization of typical CNNs to feature learning from point
clouds, thus we call it PointCNN. Experiments show that PointCNN achieves on

coefficient is designed to enforce a neutral treatment of incompleteness
whereby no assumptions are made about individual preferences involving unranked
objects. The new measure, which can be regarded as a generalization of the
seminal Kendall tau correlation coefficient, is proven to satisfy a set of
metric-like axioms and to be equivalent to a recently developed ranking
distance function associated with Kemeny aggregation. In an effort to further
unify and enhance both robust ranking methodologies, this work proves the
equivalence of an additional distance and correlation-coefficient pairing in
the space of non-strict incomplete rankings. These connections induce new exact
optimization methodologies: a specialized branch and bound algorithm and an
exact integer programming formulation. Moreover, the bridging of these
complementary theories reinforces the singular suitability of the featured
correlation coefficient to solve the general consensus ranking problem. The
latter premise is bolstered by an accompanying set of experiments on random
instances, which are generated via a herein developed sampling technique
connected with the classic Mallows distribution of ranking data. Associated
experiments with the branch and bound algorithm demonstrate that, as data
becomes noisier, the featured correlation coefficient yields relatively fewer
alternative optimal solutions and that the aggregate rankings tend to be closer
to an underlying ground truth shared by a majority.

  Application to Muon Tomography",,,"10.1063/1.5024671",,"physics.comp-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a generalized muon trajectory estimation (GMTE) algorithm
to estimate the path of a muon in either uniform or nonuniform media. The use
of cosmic ray muons in nuclear nonproliferation and safeguards verification
applications has recently gained attention due to the nonintrusive and passive
nature of the inspection, penetrating capabilities, as well as recent advances
in detectors that measure position and direction of the individual muons before
and after traversing the imaged object. However, muon image reconstruction
techniques are limited in resolution due to low muon flux and the effects of
multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS). Current reconstruction algorithms rely on
overly simple assumptions for muon path estimation through the imaged object.
For robust muon tomography, efficient and flexible physics based algorithms are
needed to model the MCS process and accurately estimate the most probable
trajectory of a muon as it traverses an object. In the present work, the use of
a Bayesian framework and a Gaussian approximation of MCS are explored for
estimation of the most likely path of a cosmic ray muon traversing uniform or
nonuniform media and undergoing MCS. The algorithm's precision is compared to
Monte Carlo simulated muon trajectories. It was found that the algorithm is
expected to be able to predict muon tracks to less than 1.5 mm RMS for 0.5 GeV
muons and 0.25 mm RMS for 3 GeV muons, a 50 percent improvement compared to SLP
and 15 percent improvement when compared to PoCA. Further, a 30 percent
increase in useful muon flux was observed relative to PoCA. Muon track
prediction improved for higher muon energies or smaller penetration depth where
energy loss is not significant. The effect of energy loss due to ionization is
investigated, and a linear energy loss relation that is easy to use is
proposed.

eigenfunctions represent the quasiperiodic, or non-mixing, component of the
dynamics. The extraction of these eigenfunctions and their associated
eigenfrequencies from a given time series is a non-trivial problem when the
underlying system has a dense point spectrum, or a continuous spectrum behaving
similarly to noise. This paper describes methods for identifying Koopman
eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions from a discretely sampled time series
generated by such a system with unknown dynamics. Our main result gives
necessary and sufficient conditions for a Fourier function, defined on $N$
states sampled along an orbit of the dynamics, to be extensible to a Koopman
eigenfunction on the whole state space, lying in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). In particular, we show that such an extension exists if and only
if the RKHS norm of the Fourier function does not diverge as $ N \to \infty $,
in which case the corresponding Fourier frequency is also a Koopman
eigenfrequency. If such an RKHS extension does not exist, we can still
construct an $L^2$ approximation of the eigenfunction. Numerical experiments on

equilibrium states of their system are parametrized by traces on the
C*-algebras of the semidirect products $J \rtimes O^*$ resulting from the
multiplicative action of the units $O^*$ on integral ideals $J$ representing
each ideal class. At each fixed inverse temperature $\beta > 2$, the extremal
equilibrium states correspond to extremal traces of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$. Here
we undertake the study of these traces using the transposed action of $O^*$ on
the duals $\hat J$ of the ideals and the recent characterization of traces on
transformation group C*-algebras due to Neshveyev. We show that the extremal
traces of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$ are parametrized by pairs consisting of an
ergodic invariant measure for the action of $O^*$ on $\hat{J}$ together with a
character of the isotropy subgroup associated to the support of this measure.
For every ideal the dual group $\hat {J}$ is a d-torus on which $O^*$ acts by
linear toral automorphisms. Hence, the problem of classifying all extremal
traces is a generalized version of Furstenberg's celebrated $\times 2$ $\times
3$ conjecture. We classify the results for various number fields in terms of
ideal class group, degree, and unit rank, and we point along the way the
trivial, the intractable, and the conjecturally classifiable cases. At the
topological level, it is possible to characterize the number fields for which
infinite $O^*$-invariant sets are dense in $\hat{J} $, thanks to a theorem of
Berend; as an application we give a description of the primitive ideal space of
$C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$ for those number fields.

The influence of internal motions on the dynamics and $T_{1,2}$ relaxation of

longer-chain $n$-alkanes. Site-by-site simulations of $^1$H's along the chains

quantified using inverse Laplace transforms, for both rigid and flexible

and operation of electric power systems. However, with increasing uncertainty
from renewable energy operation, the optimal operating point of the system
changes more significantly in real-time. In this paper, we aim at developing
control policies that are able to track the optimal set-point with high
probability. The approach is based on the observation that the OPF solution
corresponding to a certain uncertainty realization is a basic feasible
solution, which provides an affine control policy. The optimality of this basis
policy is restricted to uncertainty realizations that share the same set of
active constraints. We propose an ensemble control policy that combines several
basis policies to improve performance. Although the number of possible bases is
exponential in the size of the system, we show that only a few of them are
relevant to system operation. We adopt a statistical learning approach to learn
these important bases, and provide theoretical results that validate our
observations. For most systems, we observe that efficient ensemble policies
constructed using as few as ten bases, are able to obtain optimal solutions
with high probability.

some key technology challenges pertaining to the remote search for life in
exoplanetary systems. Finding evidence for life on rocky planets outside of our
solar system requires new technical capabilities for the key measurements of
spectral signatures of biosignature gases, and of planetary mass measurement.
Spectra of Earth-like planets can be directly measured in reflected stellar
light in the visible band or near-infrared using a factor 1e-10 starlight
suppression with occulters, either internal (coronagraph) or external
(starshade). Absorption and emission (reflected and thermal) spectra can be
obtained in the mid-infrared of rocky planets transiting M-dwarfs via
spectroscopy of the transit and secondary eclipse, respectively. Mass can be
measured from the star's reflex motion, the reflex motion of a star, via either
precision radial velocity methods or astrometry. Several technology gaps must
be closed to provide astronomers the necessary capabilities to obtain these key
measurements for small planets orbiting within the predicted temperate zones
around nearby stars. These involved performance improvements, in some cases,
1-2 orders of magnitude from state-of-the-art or involve performances never
demonstrated. The technologies advancing to close these gaps have been
identified through the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's annual Technology
Selection and Prioritization Process in collaboration with the larger exoplanet

shown that neutrino flavor, and hence nucleosynthesis, can be strongly affected
by the presence of matter-neutrino resonances (MNRs), where there is a
cancelation between the matter and the neutrino potential. Simulations
performed thus far follow flavor evolution along a single neutrino trajectory,
but self-consistency requires all trajectories to be treated simultaneously,
and it has not been known whether MNR phenomena would still occur in
multi-angle models. In this paper, we present the first fully multi-angle
calculations of MNR. We find that familiar MNR phenomena, where neutrinos
transform to a greater extent than anti-neutrinos and a feedback mechanism
maintains the cancellation between the matter and neutrino potential, still
occurs for a subset of angular bins, although the flavor transformation is not
as efficient as in the single-angle case. In addition, we find other types of
flavor transformation that are not seen in single-angle simulations. These
flavor transformation phenomena appear to be robust and are present for a wide
range of model parameters, as long as an MNR is present. Although computational
constraints currently limit us to models with spherical symmetry, our results
suggest that the presence of an MNR generally leads to large-scale neutrino
flavor evolution in multi-angle systems.

popularity, their energy cost is evidently becoming unsustainable. In most
instances, the main cost comes from the required amount of energy for the
Proof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless
costs from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability
(in number of users and in rapid transactions) limit their practical
effectiveness.
  In this paper, we present an innovative scheme which eliminates the nonce and
thus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause of the energy
waste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees
a tunable and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size
of the population in competition, thus by making the use of nonce-based
techniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the cost of consuming a
large volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based
on the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional
difference with Proof-of-Work schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce
field that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction of (what we
denote as) ""empty blocks"" which aim are to call regular blocks following a
staircase set of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides
tunable scalability for the number of users and the speed of block generation.
We also prove using game theoretical analysis that our scheme is resilient to
unfair competitive investments (e.g., ""51 percent"" attack) and block nursing.

in-situ ICME leading edge measurements at STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and Earth (Wind
and ACE) for simulations completed between March 2010-December 2016 (over 1,800
CMEs). We report hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection statistics for
all three locations. For all predicted CME arrivals, the hit rate is 0.5, and
the false alarm rate is 0.1. For the 273 events where the CME was predicted to
arrive at Earth, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, and was actually observed (hit event),
the mean absolute arrival-time prediction error was 10.4 +/- 0.9 hours, with a
tendency to early prediction error of -4.0 hours. We show the dependence of the
arrival-time error on CME input parameters. We also explore the impact of the
multi-spacecraft observations used to initialize the model CME inputs by
comparing model verification results before and after the STEREO-B
communication loss (since September 2014) and STEREO-A sidelobe operations
(August 2014-December 2015). There is an increase of 1.7 hours in the CME
arrival time error during single, or limited two-viewpoint periods, compared to
the three-spacecraft viewpoint period. This trend would apply to a future space
weather mission at L5 or L4 as another coronagraph viewpoint to reduce CME
arrival time errors compared to a single L1 viewpoint.

different types of data. This paper extends an artificial neural network model
to a partially specified space autoregressive model and proposes maximum
likelihood estimators instead of quasi-maximum likelihood estimates. We
establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators in this
model. These results are obtained under some standard conditions in spatial
models as well as neural network models. To illustrate, we investigate the
quality of the normal approximation for finite samples by means of numerical
simulation studies with three common choices of error distributions (standard
normal, student-t distribution and the Laplace distribution). We apply our
proposed model to a soil-water tension problem and a criminal study in Chicago.
The results showed that our model can capture the spatial dependence between
units as well as the unknown correlation structure between the target variable
and covariates.

spatial structure when they are focused strongly. Physically, it can be
explained by an emerging electromagnetic field component in the direction of
propagation, which is neglected in the simplified scalar wave picture in
optics. Here we ask: Is this a specific photonic behavior, or can similar
phenomena also be predicted for other species of particles? We show that the
same modification of the spatial structure exists for relativistic electrons as
well as for focused gravitational waves. However, this is for different
physical reasons: For electrons, which are described by the Dirac equation, the
spatial structure changes due to a Spin-Orbit coupling in the relativistic
regime. In gravitational waves described with linearized general relativity,
the curvature of space-time between the transverse and propagation direction
leads to the modification of the spatial structure. Thus, this universal
phenomenon exists for both massive and massless elementary particles with Spin
1/2, 1 and 2. It would be very interesting whether other types of particles
such as composite systems (neutrons or C$_{60}$) or neutrinos show a similar
behaviour and how this phenomenon can be explained in a unified physical way.

countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output
of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point
clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent
overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis
suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point
clouds inherently lack topological information so designing a model to recover

high-level tasks on point clouds including classification and segmentation.
EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It
is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to
existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point
independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local
neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape
properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures
semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original

dimensions. We start from a field theory governed by the extra-dimensional
Poincar\'e group ISO$(1,3+n)$ and by the extended gauge group $SU(N,{\cal
M}^{4+n})$, characterized by an unknown energy scale $\Lambda$ and assumed to
be valid at energies far below this scale. Assuming that the size of the extra
dimensions is much larger than the distance scale at which this theory is
valid, we construct an effective theory with symmetry groups ISO$(1,3)$,
$SU(N,{\cal M}^{4})$. Such theories are connected by a canonical transformation
that hides the extended symmetries ISO$(1,3+n)$, $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4+n})$ into
the standard ISO(1,3), $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4})$, thus generating KK gauge masses.
Using a set of orthogonal functions $\{f^{(\underline{0})},
f^{(\underline{m})}(\bar x)\}$, defined by the Casimir invariant $\bar{P}^2$ of
the translations subgroup $T(n)\subset$ISO$(n)$, we expand the degrees of
freedom of ISO(1,3+n), $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4+n})$ in general Fourier series, whose
coefficients are the degrees of freedom of ISO(1,3), $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4})$.
These functions, which correspond to the projection on the basis $\{|\bar{x}
\big >\}$ of the discrete basis $\{|0\big >,|p^{(\underline{m})}\big >\}$
generated by $\bar {P}^2$, are central to define the effective theory.
Components along the ground state $f^{(\underline{0})}=\big <\bar x|0\big>$ do
not receive mass at the compactification scale, so they are identified with the
standard Yang-Mills fields; components along excited states

  Lattice-Based Instantiation","24 pages",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient user revocation is a necessary but challenging problem in many
multi-user cryptosystems. Among known approaches, server-aided revocation
yields a promising solution, because it allows to outsource the major workloads
of system users to a computationally powerful third party, called the server,
whose only requirement is to carry out the computations correctly. Such a
revocation mechanism was considered in the settings of identity-based
encryption and attribute-based encryption by Qin et al. (ESORICS 2015) and Cui
et al. (ESORICS 2016), respectively.
  In this work, we consider the server-aided revocation mechanism in the more
elaborate setting of predicate encryption (PE). The latter, introduced by Katz,
Sahai, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2008), provides fine-grained and role-based access
to encrypted data and can be viewed as a generalization of identity-based and
attribute-based encryption. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we formalize
the model of server-aided revocable predicate encryption (SR-PE), with rigorous
definitions and security notions. Our model can be seen as a non-trivial
adaptation of Cui et al.'s work into the PE context. Second, we put forward a
lattice-based instantiation of SR-PE. The scheme employs the PE scheme of
Agrawal, Freeman and Vaikuntanathan (ASIACRYPT 2011) and the complete subtree
method of Naor, Naor, and Lotspiech (CRYPTO 2001) as the two main ingredients,
which work smoothly together thanks to a few additional techniques. Our scheme
is proven secure in the standard model (in a selective manner), based on the
hardness of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem.

particle density. The potential of a filament in a diffuse plasma is first
shown to vanish, consistent with the electron sheath model and increasing
electron emission. In a denser plasma with ample neutral pressure, the floating
filament potential is positive, as predicted by a derived ion trapping
condition. Lastly, the filament floated negatively in a third plasma, where
flowing ions and electrons and nonnegligible electric fields may have disrupted
ion trapping. Depending on the regime chosen, emitting surfaces can float
positively or negatively with respect to the plasma potential.

derive a new model involving only one unknown field from the original model
with three unknown fields: electric, magnetic fields and the induced electric
polarisation (described by a global temporal convolution of the electric

weakly singular integral kernel expressed by the Mittag-Lefler (ML) function.
The most interesting but challenging issue resides in how to efficiently deal
with the singularity in time induced by the ML function which is an infinite
series of singular power functions with different nature. With this in mind, we
introduce a spectral-Galerkin method using Fourier-like basis functions for
spatial discretization, leading to a sequence of decoupled temporal
integral-differential equations (IDE) with the same weakly singular kernel
involving the ML function as the original two-dimensional problem. With a
careful study of the regularity of IDE, we incorporate several leading singular
terms into the numerical scheme and approximate much regular part of the

scheme together with mapping technique to increase the accuracy and enhance the
resolution. We show such an enriched collocation method is convergent and

a representation of patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the Fast

learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting
multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data
harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two
U.S. academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at
least 24 hours. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data
unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes.
Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting
in-hospital mortality (AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned
readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and
all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90).
These models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all

which illustrates how clinicians can gain some transparency into the
predictions. We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate and
scalable predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios, complete with
explanations that directly highlight evidence in the patient's chart.

different from a user to different antenna arrays in a cell, which makes power
control a challenging problem as compared to conventional massive MIMO. We

transmission for the downlink. We then derive a closed-form spectral efficiency

modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. In this work, we adopt a popular
model for social opinion dynamics, and we formalize the opinion maximization
and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of
susceptibility.
  We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility lead to an
interesting family of new questions in network opinion dynamics. We find that
the questions are quite different depending on whether there is an overall
budget constraining the number of agents we can target or not. We give a
polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the
sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the
target-set. We show that this problem is NP-hard when there is a budget, and
that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Finally, we
propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization and show its efficacy
at finding target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions compared on real world
networks, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates.

constraint, i.e., one for which only certain entries of the generator matrix
are allowed to be non-zero, has found many recent applications, including in
distributed coding and storage, multiple access networks, and weakly secure
data exchange. The dual problem, where the parity check matrix has a support
constraint, comes up in the design of locally repairable codes. The central
problem here is to design codes with the largest possible minimum distance,
subject to the given support constraint on the generator matrix. An upper bound
on the minimum distance can be obtained through a set of singleton bounds,
which can be alternatively thought of as a cut-set bound. Furthermore, it is
well known that, if the field size is large enough, any random generator matrix
obeying the support constraint will achieve the maximum minimum distance with
high probability. Since random codes are not easy to decode, structured codes
with efficient decoders, e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, are much more desirable. The
GM-MDS conjecture of Dau et al states that the maximum minimum distance over
all codes satisfying the generator matrix support constraint can be obtained by
a Reed Solomon code. If true, this would have significant consequences. The
conjecture has been proven for several special case: when the dimension of the
code k is less than or equal to five, when the number of distinct support sets
on the rows of the generator matrix m, say, is less than or equal to three, or
when the generator matrix is sparsest and balanced. In this paper, we report on
further progress on the GM-MDS conjecture. In particular, we show that the
conjecture is true for all m less than equal to six. This generalizes all
previous known results (except for the sparsest and balanced case, which is a
very special support constraint).

This paper extends these simulations to incorporate redshift space distortion
and predict the expected redshift space ${\rm HI}$ 21-cm power spectrum
$P^s_{{\rm HI}}(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ using two different prescriptions for
the ${\rm HI}$ distributions and peculiar velocities. We model $P^s_{{\rm

HI}}(k)=b^2 P(k)$ with a Kaiser enhancement term and a Finger of God (FoG)
damping which has $\sigma_p$ the pair velocity dispersion as a free parameter.
Considering several possibilities for the bias and the damping profile, we find
that the models with a scale dependent bias and a Lorentzian damping profile
best fit the simulated $P^s_{{\rm HI}}(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ over the
entire range $1 \le z \le 6$. The best fit value of $\sigma_p$ falls
approximately as $(1+z)^{-m}$ with $m=2$ and $1.2$ respectively for the two
different prescriptions. The model predictions are consistent with the
simulations for $k < 0.3 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ over the entire $z$ range for the
monopole $P^s_0(k)$, and at $z \le 3$ for the quadrupole $P^s_2(k)$. At $z \ge

design a stochastic optimization algorithm to facilitate learning and
adaptation when the model parameters are unknown or vary over time, based on
ARQ feedback from the PU and CSI measurements at the SU receiver. It is shown
numerically that, for a 10% interference constraint, the optimal access policy
yields 15% improvement over a state-of-the-art scheme without SU
retransmissions, and up to 2x gain over a scheme using a non-adaptive access

Many researchers have tackled this problem by developing ways to extend

difficult to ensure an adequate degree of separation between legacy and new

Virtualization, for example, supports logical isolation of separate guest

required for real-time systems. This paper presents vLibOS, a master-slave
paradigm for new systems, whose services are built on legacy code that is

to mitigate the error propagation problem for uplink multiple-input
multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) systems. A base
station equipped with a maximum ratio combining and successive interference
cancellation (MRC-SIC) receiver is adopted for multiuser detection. The average
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR) of each user during the MRC-SIC
decoding is analyzed by taking into account the error propagation due to the
channel estimation error. Furthermore, the JPA design is formulated as a
nonconvex optimization problem to maximize the minimum weighted ASINR and is
solved optimally with geometric programming. Simulation results confirm the
developed performance analysis and show that our proposed scheme can
effectively alleviate the error propagation of MRC-SIC and enhance the
detection performance, especially for users with moderate energy budgets.

Traditionally, cross-correlation approaches; such as phase delay, coherence

these approaches for estimating the time delay and proposed an interactive

challenging task of inpainting large missing regions in an image. These methods
can generate visually plausible image structures and textures, but often create
distorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas.
This is mainly due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in
explicitly borrowing or copying information from distant spatial locations. On
the other hand, traditional texture and patch synthesis approaches are
particularly suitable when it needs to borrow textures from the surrounding
regions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new deep generative
model-based approach which can not only synthesize novel image structures but
also explicitly utilize surrounding image features as references during network
training to make better predictions. The model is a feed-forward, fully
convolutional neural network which can process images with multiple holes at
arbitrary locations and with variable sizes during the test time. Experiments
on multiple datasets including faces (CelebA, CelebA-HQ), textures (DTD) and
natural images (ImageNet, Places2) demonstrate that our proposed approach
generates higher-quality inpainting results than existing ones. Code, demo and

differences between the individual readout errors and those found when
measuring the qubits simultaneously are within $1\%$. We employ individual
Purcell filters for each readout resonator to suppress off-resonant driving,

based on a discrete Weibull distribution provides partial effects of the
covariates on fertility plans which are comparable to jittering, without the
inherent drawback of crossing conditional quantiles. The model has some
additional desirable features: both over- and under-dispersed data can be
modelled by this distribution, the conditional quantiles have a simple analytic
form and the likelihood is the same of that of a continuous Weibull
distribution with interval-censored data. The latter means that efficient
implementations are already available, in the R package gamlss, for a range of

the jittering and COM-Poisson approaches, showing potential for the wide
applicability of this approach to the modelling of count data.

hierarchical recurrent neural networks (HRNN) for speech bandwidth extension
(BWE). Different from conventional BWE methods which predict spectral
parameters for reconstructing wideband speech waveforms, this BWE method models
and predicts waveform samples directly without using vocoders. Inspired by
SampleRNN which is an unconditional neural audio generator, the HRNN model
represents the distribution of each wideband or high-frequency waveform sample
conditioned on the input narrowband waveform samples using a neural network
composed of long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and feed-forward (FF) layers.
The LSTM layers form a hierarchical structure and each layer operates at a
specific temporal resolution to efficiently capture long-span dependencies
between temporal sequences. Furthermore, additional conditions, such as the
bottleneck (BN) features derived from narrowband speech using a deep neural
network (DNN)-based state classifier, are employed as auxiliary input to
further improve the quality of generated wideband speech. The experimental
results of comparing several waveform modeling methods show that the HRNN-based
method can achieve better speech quality and run-time efficiency than the
dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based method and the plain
sample-level recurrent neural network (SRNN)-based method. Our proposed method
also outperforms the conventional vocoder-based BWE method using LSTM-RNNs in
terms of the subjective quality of the reconstructed wideband speech.

(i) for individual ISM regions within single spatially-resolved galaxies and
(ii) when dealing with average abundances in the whole ISM of many unresolved
galaxies. We make use of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation including
detailed chemical enrichment, which properly takes into account the variety of
different stellar nucleosynthetic sources of O and N in galaxies. We identify
$33$ galaxies in the simulation, lying within dark matter halos with virial
mass in the range $10^{11}\le M_{\text{DM}} \le 10^{13}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ and
reconstruct how they evolved with redshift. For the local and global
measurements, the observed increasing trend of N/O at high O/H can be
explained, respectively, (i) as the consequence of metallicity gradients which
have settled in the galaxy interstellar medium, where the innermost galactic
regions have the highest O/H abundances and the highest N/O ratios, and (ii) as
the consequence of an underlying average mass-metallicity relation that
galaxies obey as they evolve across cosmic epochs, where -- at any redshift --
less massive galaxies have lower average O/H and N/O ratios than the more
massive ones. We do not find a strong dependence on the environment. For both
local and global relations, the predicted N/O--O/H relation is due to the
mostly secondary origin of N in stars. We also predict that the O/H and N/O
gradients in the galaxy interstellar medium gradually flatten as functions of
redshift, with the average N/O ratios being strictly coupled with the galaxy
star formation history. Because N production strongly depends on O abundances,
we obtain a universal relation for the N/O--O/H abundance diagram whether we
consider average abundances of many unresolved galaxies put together or many
abundance measurements within a single spatially-resolved galaxy.

which is perfect for testing such alternatives. Apply an unsupervised
classification scheme based on $K$-means to the massive APOGEE data set.
Explore whether the data are amenable to classification into discrete classes.
We apply the $K$-means algorithm to 153,847 high resolution spectra

algorithm, as well as our choice of parameters. We show that a classification
based on normalised spectra captures the variations in stellar atmospheric
parameters, chemical abundances, and rotational velocity, among other factors.
The algorithm is able to separate the bulge and halo populations, and
distinguish dwarfs, sub-giants, RC and RGB stars. However, a discrete
classification in flux space does not result in a neat organisation in the
parameters space. Furthermore, the lack of obvious groups in flux space causes
the results to be fairly sensitive to the initialisation, and disrupts the
efficiency of commonly-used methods to select the optimal number of clusters.
Our classification is publicly available, including extensive online material
associated with the APOGEE Data Release 12 (DR12). Our description of the
APOGEE database can enormously help with the identification of specific types
of targets for various applications. We find a lack of obvious groups in flux
space, and identify limitations of the $K$-means algorithm in dealing with this

planet formation paradigm. Even though dust is ubiquitous in protoplanetary
disks, its dynamical role in the migration history of planetary embryos has not
been assessed. In this Letter, we show that the scattered pebble-flow induced
by a low-mass planetary embryo leads to an asymmetric dust-density distribution
that is able to exert a net torque. By analyzing a large suite of multifluid
hydrodynamical simulations addressing the interaction between the disk and a
low-mass planet on a fixed circular orbit, and neglecting dust feedback onto
the gas, we identify two different regimes, gas- and gravity-dominated, where
the scattered pebble-flow results in almost all cases in positive torques. We
collect our measurements in a first torque map for dusty disks, which will
enable the incorporation of the effect of dust dynamics on migration into
population synthesis models. Depending on the dust drift speed, the dust-to-gas
mass ratio/distribution and the embryo mass, the dust-induced torque has the
potential to halt inward migration or even induce fast outward migration of
planetary cores. We thus anticipate that dust-driven migration could play a
dominant role during the formation history of planets. Because dust torques
scale with disk metallicity, we propose that dust-driven outward migration may
enhance the occurrence of distant giant planets in higher-metallicity systems.

cluster of $M$ small bubbles, distributed in a bounded domain $\Omega$, with
relative densities having contrasts of the order $a^{\beta}, \beta>0, $ where
$a$ models their relative maximum diameter, $a\ll 1$. We provide useful and
natural conditions on the number $M$, the minimum distance and the contrasts
parameter $\beta$ of the small bubbles under which the point interaction
approximation (called also the Foldy-Lax approximation) is valid.
  With the regimes allowed by our conditions, we can deal with a general class
of such materials. Applications of these expansions in material sciences and
imaging are immediate. For instance, they are enough to derive and justify the
effective media of the cluster of the bubbles for a class of gases with
densities having contrasts of the order $a^{\beta}$, $\beta \in (\frac{3}{2},
2)$ and in this case we can handle any fixed frequency. In the particular and
important case $\beta=2$, we can handle any fixed frequency far or close (but
distinct) from the corresponding Minnaert resonance. The cluster of the bubbles
can be distributed to generate volumetric metamaterials but also low
dimensional ones as metascreens and metawires.

Localizing subsurface magnetic field concentrations in the Sun with
helioseismology will help us to understand the solar dynamo. Because the
magnetic fields are not considered in standard solar models, adding them to the
basic equations of stellar structure changes the eigenfunctions and
eigenfrequencies. We use quasi-degenerate perturbation theory to calculate the
effect of toroidal magnetic fields on solar oscillation mean multiplet
frequencies for six field configurations. In our calculations, we consider both
the direct effect of the magnetic field, which describes the coupling of modes,
and the indirect effect, which accounts for changes in stellar structure due to
the magnetic field. We limit our calculations to self-coupling of modes. We
find that the magnetic field affects the multiplet frequencies in a way that
depends on the location and the geometry of the field inside the Sun. Comparing
our theoretical results with observed shifts, we find that strong tachocline
fields cannot be responsible for the observed frequency shifts of p modes over
the solar cycle. We also find that part of the surface effect in helioseismic
oscillation frequencies might be attributed to magnetic fields in the outer
layers of the Sun. The theory presented here is also applicable to models of
solar-like stars and their oscillation frequencies.

networks remains a major goal in neuroscience. We investigated whether
navigation is a parsimonious routing model for connectomics. Navigating a
network involves progressing to the next node that is closest in distance to a
desired destination. We developed a measure to quantify navigation efficiency
and found that connectomes in a range of mammalian species (human, mouse and
macaque) can be successfully navigated with near-optimal efficiency (>80% of
optimal efficiency for typical connection densities). Rewiring network topology
or repositioning network nodes resulted in 45%-60% reductions in navigation
performance. Specifically, we found that brain networks cannot be progressively
rewired (randomized or clusterized) to result in topologies with significantly
improved navigation performance. Navigation was also found to: i) promote a
resource-efficient distribution of the information traffic load, potentially
relieving communication bottlenecks; and, ii) explain significant variation in
functional connectivity. Unlike prevalently studied communication strategies in
connectomics, navigation does not mandate biologically unrealistic assumptions
about global knowledge of network topology. We conclude that the wiring and
spatial embedding of brain networks is conducive to effective decentralized
communication. Graph-theoretic studies of the connectome should consider
measures of network efficiency and centrality that are consistent with
decentralized models of neural communication.

on ordinal patterns in order to detect it. This test uncovers the fact that the
so-called ""day-of-the-week"" effect is partly an artifact of the hidden
correlation structure of the data. We present simulations based on artificial
time series as well. Whereas time series generated with long memory are prone
to exhibit daily seasonality, pure white noise signals exhibit no pattern
preference. Since ours is a non parametric test, it requires no assumptions
about the distribution of returns so that it could be a practical alternative
to conventional econometric tests. We made also an exhaustive application of
the here proposed technique to 83 stock indices around the world. Finally, the
paper highlights the relevance of symbolic analysis in economic time series
studies.

acoustic topological insulators with nonzero Chern numbers, viz., acoustic

reduce the required speed of rotation. Experimental results show that the ACI
featured with a stable and uniform metafluid flow bias supports one-way
nonreciprocal transport of sound at the boundaries, which is topologically
immune to the defect-induced scatterings. Our work opens up opportunities for
exploring unique observable topological phases and developing practical
nonreciprocal devices in acoustics.

However, this will no longer be the case when the measurement losses are
unknown and/or the system is nonlinear or non-Gaussian. By exploiting the
binary property of the measurement loss process and the IKF, we design three
suboptimal filters for the state estimation, i.e., BKF-I, BKF-II and RBPF. The
BKF-I is based on the MAP estimator of the measurement loss process and the
BKF-II is derived by estimating the conditional loss probability. The RBPF is a
particle filter based algorithm which marginalizes out the loss process to
increase the efficiency of particles. All the proposed filters can be easily
implemented in recursive forms. Finally, a linear system, a target tracking
system and a quadrotor's path control problem are included to illustrate their
effectiveness, and show the tradeoff between computational complexity and
estimation accuracy of the proposed filters.

databases: (i) newspaper articles (Japanese), (ii) blog articles (Japanese),
and (iii) page views of Wikipedia (English, French, Chinese, and Japanese).
Secondly, we use theoretical analysis to show that this diffusion is basically
explained by the random walk model with the power-law forgetting with the
exponent $\beta \approx 0.5$, which is related to the fractional Langevin
equation. The exponent $\beta$ characterises the speed of forgetting and $\beta
\approx 0.5$ corresponds to (i) the border (or thresholds) between the

Thirdly, the generative model of the time-series of word counts of already

sampled by the above-mentioned random walk model, can almost reproduce not only
the empirical mean-squared displacement but also the power spectrum density and

ratio is expected to be considerably lower than in primordial,protoplanetary
discs. However, recent observations have confirmed the presence of a
non-negligible amount of cold gas in the circumstellar (CS) debris discs around
young main-sequence stars.This cold gas has been suggested to be related to the
outgassing of planetesimals and cometary-like objects. The aim of the paper is
to investigate the presence of hot gas in the surroundings of stars bearing
cold-gas debris discs. High-resolution optical spectra of all currently known
cold-gas-bearing debris-disc systems, with the exception of $\beta$ Pic and
Fomalhaut, have been obtained from different observatories.We have analysed the
Ca II H & K and the Na I D lines searching for non-photospheric absorptions of
CS origin, usually attributed to cometary-like activity. Narrow, stable Ca II
and/or Na I absorption features have been detected superimposed to the
photospheric lines in 10 out of the 15 observed cold-gas-bearing debris
disc.Features are found at the radial velocity of the stars, or slightly blue-
or red-shifted, and/or at the velocity of the local interstellar medium (ISM).
Some stars also present transient variable events or absorptions extended
towards red wavelengths. These are the first detections of such Ca II features
in 7 out of the 15 observed stars. In some of these stars, results suggest that
the stable and variable absorptions arise from relatively hot gas located in
the CS close-in environment. This hot gas is detected in at least ~80%, of
edge-on cold-gas-bearing debris discs, while in only ~10% of the discs seen
close to face-on. We interpret this as a geometrical effect, and suggest that
the non-detection of hot gas absorptions is due to the disc inclination rather
than to the absence of the hot-gas component.

is to reduce it to the problem of semi-definite programs (SDPs) which can be
efficiently solved in theory. In practice, although many SDP solvers can work
out some problems of big scale, the efficiency and reliability of such method
decrease greatly while the input size increases. Recently, by exploiting the
sparsity of the input SOS decomposition problem, some preprocessing algorithms
were proposed [5,17], which first divide the input problem satisfying special
definitions or properties into smaller SDP problems and then pass the smaller
ones to SDP solvers to obtain reliable results efficiently. A natural question
is that to what extent the above mentioned preprocessing algorithms work. That
is, how many polynomials satisfying those definitions or properties are there
in the SOS polynomials? In this paper, we define a concept of block SOS
decomposable polynomials which is a generalization of those special classes in
[5] and [17]. Roughly speaking, it is a class of polynomials whose SOS
decomposition problem can be transformed into smaller ones (in other words, the
corresponding SDP matrices can be block-diagnolized) by considering their
supports only (coefficients are not considered). Then we prove that the set of
block SOS decomposable polynomials has measure zero in the set of SOS
polynomials. That means if we only consider supports (not with coefficients) of
polynomials, such algorithms decreasing the size of SDPs for those SDP-based
SOS solvers can only work on very few polynomials. As a result, this shows that
the SOS decomposition problems that can be optimized by the above mentioned
preprocessing algorithms are very few.

for on-road driving of an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) in presence of static
or moving obstacles. We propose a systematic approach to partition the
collision-free portion of the space-time into convex sub-regions that can be
interpreted in terms of relative positions with respect to a set of fixed or
mobile obstacles. We show that this partitioning allows decomposing the NP-hard
problem of computing an optimal collision-free trajectory, as a path-finding
problem in a well-designed graph followed by a simple (polynomial time)
optimization phase for any quadratic convex cost function. Moreover, robustness
criteria such as margin of error while executing the trajectory can easily be
taken into account at the graph-exploration phase, thus reducing the number of
paths to explore.

otherwise unresolved with conventional CT by rendering phase gradients in the
X-ray wavefield visible. This can improve the contrast resolution of soft
tissues structures, like the lungs and brain, by orders of magnitude. Phase
retrieval suppresses noise, revealing weakly-attenuating soft tissue
structures, however it does not remove the artefacts from the highly
attenuating bone of the skull and from imperfections in the imaging system that
can obscure those structures. The primary causes of these artefacts are
investigated and a simple method to visualise the features they obstruct is
proposed, which can easily be implemented for preclinical animal studies. We
show that phase contrast X-ray CT (PCXI-CT) can resolve the soft tissues of the
brain in situ without a need for contrast agents at a dose $\sim$400 times
lower than would be required by standard absorption contrast CT. We generalise
a well-known phase retrieval algorithm for multiple-material samples

drift radially inward on comparatively short timescales. In this context, it
has long been known that the presence of a gap opened by a planet can alter the
dust dynamics significantly. In this paper, we carry out a systematic study
employing long-term numerical simulations aimed at characterizing the critical
particle-size for retention outside a gap as a function of particle size and
for various key parameters defining the protoplanetary disk model. To this end,
we perform multifluid hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions, including
different dust species, which we treat as pressureless fluids. We initialize
the dust outside of the planet's orbit and study under which conditions dust
grains are able to cross the gap carved by the planet. In agreement with
previous work, we find that the permeability of the gap depends both on dust
dynamical properties and the gas disk structure: while small dust follows the
viscously accreting gas through the gap, dust grains approaching a critical
size are progressively filtered out. Moreover, we introduce and compute a
depletion factor that enables us to quantify the way in which higher viscosity,
smaller planet mass, or a more massive disk can shift this critical size to
larger values. Our results indicate that gap-opening planets may act to deplete
the inner reaches of protoplanetary disks of large dust grains -- potentially
limiting the accretion of solids onto forming terrestrial planets.

increases with increasing photoexcitation density and reaches timescales longer
than the rise time of the transient electronic temperature. We conclude that
the PIPT is driven by a transient increase of the lattice temperature following
the energy transfer from the electrons. However, the photoinduced changes of
the spectral function are small, which indicates that the low temperature phase
is particularly robust against photoexcitation. We suggest that the system
might be trapped in an out-of-equilibrium state, for which only a partial
structural transition is achieved.

emission lines of SO$_2$ and the different isotopologues of SiO. We also detect
CO, H$_2$O, HCN, CN, PO, PN, SO, and tentatively TiO$_2$, AlO, and NaCl.
Sixteen out of approximately 320 spectral features remain unidentified. Among

unidentified lines are found in a similarly sensitive survey of IK Tau
performed with the IRAM 30m telescope. We present radiative transfer models for
five isotopologues of SiO ($^{28}$SiO, $^{29}$SiO, $^{30}$SiO, Si$^{17}$O,
Si$^{18}$O), providing constraints on their fractional abundance and radial
extent. We derive isotopic ratios for C, O, Si, and S and estimate that R Dor
likely had an initial mass in the range 1.3-1.6$M_{\odot}$, in agreement with
earlier findings based on models of H$_2$O line emission. From the presence of

The cohomology of this complex is isomorphic to the Tate-Hochschild cohomology
in the sense of Buchweitz. By a natural action of the cellular chain operad of
the spineless cacti operad, introduced by R. Kaufmann, on the singular
Hochschild cochain complex, we provide a proof of the Deligne's conjecture for
this complex. More concretely, the complex is an algebra over the (dg) operad

the singular Hochschild cochain complex has a $B$-infinity algebra structure
and its cohomology ring is a Gerstenhaber algebra.
  Inspired by the original definition of Tate cohomology for finite groups, we
define a generalized Tate-Hochschild complex with the Hochschild chains in
negative degrees and the Hochschild cochains in non-negative degrees. There is
a natural embedding of this complex into the singular Hochschild cochain
complex. In the case of a self-injective algebra, this embedding becomes a
quasi-isomorphism. In particular, for a symmetric algebra, this allows us to
show that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring, equipped with the Gerstenhaber
algebra structure, is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra.

However, it is unclear how a practical CTIN operates in the absence of channel
state information which is needed for CTIN but cannot be obtained from the CTC.
We present XZero, the first practical CTIN system that is able to quickly find
the suitable precoding configuration used for interference nulling without
having to search the whole space of angular orientations. XZero performs a
tree-based search to find the direction for the null beam(s) by exploiting the
feedback received from the WiFi AP on the tested null directions. We have
implemented a prototype of XZero using SDR platform for LTE-U and commodity
hardware for WiFi and evaluated its performance in a large indoor testbed.
Evaluation results reveal on average a reduction by 15.7 dB in
interference-to-noise ratio at the nulled WiFi nodes when using a ULA with four
antennas. Moreover, XZero has a sub-second reconfiguration delay which is up to
10x smaller as compared to naive exhaustive linear search.

supernovae and strong gravitational lensing (SGL) observations. We find that a
spatially closed Universe is preferred. Moreover, by considering different
kinds of velocity dispersion and subsample, we study possible factors which
might affect model-independent estimations for the spatial curvature from SGL
observations. It is suggested that the combination of observational data from
different surveys might cause a systematic bias and the tension between the
spatially flat Universe and SGL observations is alleviated when the subsample
only from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey is used or a more complex treatment for the
density profile of lenses is considered.

core collapse including time-dependent changes in density and temperature
differ greatly from abundances derived from static models, where the density
and temperature structures of the core are kept fixed as the chemistry evolves.
For this study we developed a new one-dimensional spherically symmetric
hydrodynamics code that couples the hydrodynamics equations with a
comprehensive time-dependent gas-grain chemical model, including deuterium and
spin-state chemistry, and radiative transfer calculations to derive
self-consistent time-dependent chemical abundance gradients. We applied the
code to model the collapse of a starless core up to the point when the infall
flow becomes supersonic.
  The abundances predicted by the dynamical and static models are almost
identical during the quiescent phase of core evolution, but the results start
to diverge after the onset of core collapse, where the static model
underestimates abundances at high medium density (inner core) and
underestimates them at low density (outer core), and this is clearly reflected
in simulated lines. The static model generally overestimates deuteration, which
is increasingly evident the more D atoms are substituted in the molecule. We
also find that using a limited chemical network, or a limited set of cooling
molecules, may lead to an overestimate of the collapse timescale, and in some
cases may prevent the collapse altogether. In our model, most of the line
cooling near the center of the core is due to HCN, CO, and NO. In conclusion,
the use of a static physical model is not a reliable method of simulating
chemical abundances in starless cores after the onset of gravitational
collapse. The adoption of complex chemistry and a comprehensive set of cooling
molecules is necessary to model the collapse adequately.

calculations with a Hubbard Hamiltonian and long-range dispersion corrections
(DFT+$U-$D3). Based on the analysis of the configurational free energy, we have
elucidated a partially inverse equilibrium cation distribution for the
LiMn$_2$O$_4$ spinel. This equilibrium degree of inversion is rationalised in
terms of the crystal field stabilisation effects and the difference between the
size of the cations. We compare the atomic charges with the oxidation numbers
for each degree of inversion. We found segregation of the Mn charge once these
ions occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel. We have
obtained the atomic projections of the electronic band structure and density of
states, showing that the normal LiMn$_2$O$_4$ has half-metallic properties,
while the fully inverse spinel is an insulator. This material is in the
ferrimagnetic state for the inverse and partially inverse cation arrangement.
The optimised lattice and oxygen parameters, as well as the equilibrium degree
of inversion, are in agreement with the available experimental data. The
partially inverse equilibrium degree of inversion is important in the
interpretation of the lithium ion migration and surface properties of the

dipolar mode (MDM) oscillations in a magnetically saturated quasi 2D ferrite

long range dipole dipole correlation in positions of electron spins can be

spread critically relies on uncovering the underlying diffusion mechanisms,

time-evolving intensity. We infer causal relationships between infections and
quantify the reflexivity of a meta-population, the level of feedback on event
occurrences by its internal dynamics (likelihood of a regional outbreak
triggered by previous cases). These are enabled by our new proposed model, the
Latent Influence Point Process (LIPP) which models disease spread by
incorporating macro-level internal dynamics of meta-populations based on human
mobility. We analyse 15-year dengue cases in Queensland, Australia. From our
causal inference, outbreaks are more likely driven by statewide global
diffusion over time, leading to complex behavior of disease spread. In terms of
reflexivity, precursory growth and symmetric decline in populous regions is
attributed to slow but persistent feedback on preceding outbreaks via
inter-group dynamics, while abrupt growth but sharp decline in peripheral areas
is led by rapid but inconstant feedback via intra-group dynamics. Our proposed
model reveals probabilistic causal relationships between discrete events based
on intra- and inter-group dynamics and also covers direct and indirect
diffusion processes (contact-based and vector-borne disease transmissions).

quark and diquark current contributes to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ in the
space-like (SL) region in the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. In this
picture, the heavy baryon $\Lambda_c $ is regarded as composed of a heavy quark
and a scalar diquark. We find that for different values of parameters the quark
and diquark current contribute to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ is very different,
but the total contribute to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ is similarly. The EMFFs of
$\Lambda_c$ are similar to those of other baryons (proton, $\Xi^-$, $\Sigma^+$)
with a peak at $\omega =1$ ($\omega=v^\prime \cdot v $ is the velocity transfer
between the initial state (with velocity $v$) and the final state (with
velocity $v^\prime$) of $\Lambda_c$).

analyzed in the energy range between 0.40-50 GV to explore possible
periodicities besides the well known solar undecennial modulation. An
unexpected clear and regular feature has been found at rigidities below 15 GV,
with a quasi-periodicity of $\sim$450 days. A possible Jovian origin of this
periodicity has been investigated in different ways. The results seem to favor
a small but not negligible contribution to cosmic rays from the Jovian
magnetosphere, even if other explanations cannot be excluded.

that proton beams with characteristics comparable to those obtained with solid

simulations, this paper studies in detail the effects of a near-critical
density gradient on ion and electron acceleration after the interaction with
ultra high intensity lasers. We can observe that the peak density of the gas
jet has a significant influence on the spectrum features. As the gas jet
density increases, so does the peak energy of the central quasi-monoenergetic
ion bunch due to the increase in laser absorption while at the same time having
a broadening effect on the electron angular distribution.

environment induce transitions in their quantum states that can cause errors in
computation. The nature of these interactions depend on the specific physical
implementation of the circuit. In the case of silicon dangling bond QCA, one
channel of environmental interaction is between dangling bond cells and
longitudinal phonons in the silicon lattice. In the presence of this
environmental interaction, short 4 cell wire simulations show reliable
operation at liquid nitrogen temperature, however simulation and theoretical
arguments suggest long wires operated from thermal equilibrium are susceptible
to exponential decay of cell polarization along their length regardless of
clock zoning. Quantum annealing is suggested as a technique for bringing QCA
wires into their ground state prior to information transmission to circumvent
this problem.

affected by the shape and material composition of the latter. Artificially
created materials, formed by a subwavelength structuring of their unit cells,
namely metamaterials, can exhibit peculiar responses to electromagnetic
radiation and provide additional powerful degrees of freedom to the scatterer
design. In particular, negative material susceptibilities give rise to strong
resonant interactions with deeply subwavelength particles. While the negative
electrical permittivity of natural noble metals manifests itself in localized
plasmon resonant oscillations, negative magnetic permeability is virtually
non-existent in nature. Here the concept of artificial magnon resonance in
subwavelength objects with effective negative permeability, designed based on
the metamaterial approach, is demonstrated. Strong localized oscillations of
the magnetic fields within an array of split ring resonators, forming a sphere,
hybridize in a collective mode of the structure. As a result, extremely high
scattering cross section, exceeding that of a steel sphere with the same radius
by four orders of magnitude, was demonstrated. Furthermore, the scattering
cross section of subwavelength metamaterial-based sphere was shown to be
comparable to the low frequency (MHz) radar signature of a big military
aircraft. Super scatterers, based on tunable resonances within artificially
created materials, can find use in a broad range of electromagnetic
applications, including wireless communications, radars, RFID, internet of
things hardware and many others.

  Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT)",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of misinformation propagation is studied for an
Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker seeks to
inject false information in the IoBT nodes in order to compromise the IoBT
operations. In the considered model, each IoBT node seeks to counter the
misinformation attack by finding the optimal probability of accepting a given
information that minimizes its cost at each time instant. The cost is expressed
in terms of the quality of information received as well as the infection cost.
The problem is formulated as a mean-field game with multiclass agents which is
suitable to model a massive heterogeneous IoBT system. For this game, the
mean-field equilibrium is characterized, and an algorithm based on the forward
backward sweep method is proposed to find the mean-field equilibrium. Then, the
finite IoBT case is considered, and the conditions of convergence of the Nash
equilibria in the finite case to the mean-field equilibrium are presented.
Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a 1.2-fold increase
in the quality of information (QoI) compared to a baseline scheme in which the
IoBT nodes are always transmitting. The results also show that the proposed
scheme can reduce the proportion of infected nodes by 99% compared to the
baseline.
