  Approach","43 pages, revised version",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work shows how exponential concentration inequalities for additive
functionals of stochastic processes over a finite time interval can be derived
from concentration inequalities for martingales. The approach is entirely
probabilistic and naturally includes time-inhomogeneous and non-stationary
processes as well as initial laws concentrated on a single point. The class of
processes studied includes martingales, Markov processes and general square
integrable processes. The general approach is complemented by a simple and
direct method for martingales, diffusions and discrete-time Markov processes.
The method is illustrated by deriving concentration inequalities for the
Polyak-Ruppert algorithm, SDEs with time-dependent drift coefficients
""contractive at infinity"" with both Lipschitz and squared Lipschitz
observables, some classical martingales and non-elliptic SDEs.

the key for this present simple quantum thermal diode, whose resonant operation

can learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continues action space.
Different reward signals, e.g. total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency
braking, and vehicular emission are used to train the DVSL controller, and
comparison between these reward signals are conducted. We test proposed DRL
baased DVSL controllers on a simulated freeway recurrent bottleneck. Results

classify human activities or predict human behavior by means of features
extracted from sensors data. Typical HAR systems use wearable sensors and/or
handheld and mobile devices with built-in sensing capabilities. Due to the
widespread use of smartphones and to the inclusion of various sensors in all
contemporary smartphones (e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes), they are
commonly used for extracting and collecting data from sensors and even for
implementing HAR systems. When using mobile devices, e.g., smartphones, HAR
systems need to deal with several constraints regarding battery, computation
and memory. These constraints enforce the need of a system capable of managing
its resources and maintain acceptable levels of classification accuracy.
Moreover, several factors can influence activity recognition, such as
classification models, sensors availability and size of data window for feature
extraction, making stable accuracy a difficult task. In this paper, we present
a semi-supervised classifier and a study regarding the influence of
hyperparameter configuration in classification accuracy, depending on the user
and the activities performed by each user. This study focuses on sensing data
provided by the PAMAP2 dataset. Experimental results show that it is possible
to maintain classification accuracy by adjusting hyperparameters, like window
size and windows overlap factor, depending on user and activity performed.
These experiments motivate the development of a system able to automatically
adapt hyperparameter settings for the activity performed by each user.

that stickiness may depend on small scale quantities such as rms slopes and/or

roughness at short wavelengths is irrelevant. We find stickiness is destroyed
typically at roughness amplitudes up to three orders of magnitude larger than
the range of attractive forces. With typical nanometer values of the latter,
the criterion gives justification to the qualitative well known empirical
Dalhquist criterion for stickiness which demands adhesives to have elastic

both the scientific and technological world of adhesion, and may serve as
benchmark for better comprehension of the role of roughness.

Normalization (BN) plays an indispensable role. However, it has been observed
that BN is costly due to the reduction operations. In this paper, we propose
alleviating this problem through sampling only a small fraction of data for
normalization at each iteration. Specifically, we model it as a statistical
sampling problem and identify that by sampling less correlated data, we can
largely reduce the requirement of the number of data for statistics estimation
in BN, which directly simplifies the reduction operations. Based on this
conclusion, we propose two sampling strategies, ""Batch Sampling"" (randomly
select several samples from each batch) and ""Feature Sampling"" (randomly select
a small patch from each feature map of all samples), that take both
computational efficiency and sample correlation into consideration.
Furthermore, we introduce an extremely simple variant of BN, termed as Virtual
Dataset Normalization (VDN), that can normalize the activations well with few
synthetical random samples. All the proposed methods are evaluated on various
datasets and networks, where an overall training speedup by up to 20% on GPU is
practically achieved without the support of any specialized libraries, and the
loss on accuracy and convergence rate are negligible. Finally, we extend our
work to the ""micro-batch normalization"" problem and yield comparable

propagation can be faster than expected from axisymmetric simulations, covering
tens of kiloparsecs in a few million years, until the dentist drill effect
produced by the growth of helical instabilities slows down the propagation
speed of the jet head. A comparison of key physical parameters of the jet

observations of FRII sources reveals good agreement. Our simulations show that
shock heating can play a significant role in the feedback from active galaxies,

rule out a gray cloud deck at a confidence level of 3.8-sigma and may instead
be explained by VO spectral bands. We find a cloud-free model assuming chemical
equilibrium for a temperature of 1500K and metal enrichment of 10-30x solar
matches these data well. Using a free-chemistry retrieval analysis, we estimate
a VO abundance of -6.6(-0.3,+0.2) dex. We find no evidence for TiO and place a
3-sigma upper limit of -7.9 dex on its abundance, suggesting TiO may have
condensed from the gas phase at the day-night limb. The opacity rises steeply
at the shortest wavelengths, increasing by approximately five pressure scale
heights from 0.47 to 0.3 micron in wavelength. If this feature is caused by
Rayleigh scattering due to uniformly-distributed aerosols, it would imply an
unphysically high temperature of 6810+/-1530K. One alternative explanation for
the short-wavelength rise is absorption due to SH (mercapto radical), which has
been predicted as an important product of non-equilibrium chemistry in hot
Jupiter atmospheres. Irrespective of the identity of the NUV absorber, it
likely captures a significant amount of incident stellar radiation at low
pressures, thus playing a significant role in the overall energy budget,
thermal structure, and circulation of the atmosphere.

probability an adequate real-world meaning, and how to explain a certain type
of phenomenon that can be found, for instance, in Ellsberg's paradox. It
attempts to answer these questions by constructing an alternative theory to one
that was proposed in earlier papers on the basis of various important
criticisms that were raised against this earlier theory. The conceptual
principles of the corresponding definition of probability are laid out and
explained in detail. In particular, what is required to fully specify a
probability distribution under this definition is not just the distribution
function of the variable concerned, but also an assessment of the internal
and/or the external strength of this function relative to other distribution
functions of interest. This way of defining probability is applied to various
examples and problems including, perhaps most notably, to a long-running
controversy concerning the distinction between Bayesian and fiducial inference.
The characteristics of this definition of probability are carefully evaluated
in terms of the issues that it sets out to address.

The core idea is to learn plausible computational and biological
representations by correlating human neural activity and natural images. Thus,
we first propose a model, EEG-ChannelNet, to learn a brain manifold for EEG
classification. After verifying that visual information can be extracted from
EEG data, we introduce a multimodal approach that uses deep image and EEG
encoders, trained in a siamese configuration, for learning a joint manifold
that maximizes a compatibility measure between visual features and brain
representations. We then carry out image classification and saliency detection
on the learned manifold. Performance analyses show that our approach
satisfactorily decodes visual information from neural signals. This, in turn,
can be used to effectively supervise the training of deep learning models, as
demonstrated by the high performance of image classification and saliency
detection on out-of-training classes. The obtained results show that the
learned brain-visual features lead to improved performance and simultaneously
bring deep models more in line with cognitive neuroscience work related to
visual perception and attention.

explore this problem using a two-time quasi-probability linear in the
projection operators, a natural counterpart of the corresponding classical
problem. We show that it can be measured either indirectly, by measuring its
moments in different experiments, or directly, in a single experiment using a
pair of sequential measurements in which the first measurement is weak (or more
generally, ambiguous). We argue that when positive, it corresponds to a
measurement-independent arrival time probability. For small time intervals it
coincides approximately with the time-averaged current, in agreement with
semiclassical expectations. The quasi-probability can be negative and we
exhibit a number of situations in which this is the case. We interpret these
situations as the presence of `quantumness', in which the arrival time
probability is not properly defined in a measurement-independent manner.
Backflow states, in which the current flows in the direction opposite to the
momentum, are shown to provide an interesting class of examples such
situations. We also show that the quasi-probability is closely linked to a set
of two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities, which test for macroscopic realism.

a site-selective Mott insulator where itinerant electrons evolving in

curves. An important variant is the discrete Fr\'echet distance under
translation, which enables detection of similar movement patterns in different
spatial domains. For polygonal curves of length $n$ in the plane, the fastest
known algorithm runs in time $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5})$ [Ben Avraham, Kaplan,
Sharir '15]. This is achieved by constructing an arrangement of disks of size
${\cal O}(n^{4})$, and then traversing its faces while updating reachability in
a directed grid graph of size $N := {\cal O}(n^2)$, which can be done in time
$\tilde{\cal O}(\sqrt{N})$ per update [Diks, Sankowski '07]. The contribution
of this paper is two-fold.
  First, although it is an open problem to solve dynamic reachability in
directed grid graphs faster than $\tilde{\cal O}(\sqrt{N})$, we improve this
part of the algorithm: We observe that an offline variant of dynamic
$s$-$t$-reachability in directed grid graphs suffices, and we solve this
variant in amortized time $\tilde{\cal O}(N^{1/3})$ per update, resulting in an
improved running time of $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{4.66...})$ for the discrete

constructing the arrangement of size ${\cal O}(n^{4})$ is necessary in the
worst case, by proving a conditional lower bound of $n^{4 - o(1)}$ on the
running time for the discrete Fr\'echet distance under translation, assuming
the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.

weight the contribution of observation and background information in data

matrix without the use of techniques to reduce its condition number. In this
paper we present new theory for two existing methods that can be used to
'recondition' any covariance matrix: ridge regression, and the minimum
eigenvalue method. We compare these methods with multiplicative variance
inflation. We investigate the impact of reconditioning on variances and
correlations of a general covariance matrix in both a theoretical and practical
setting. Improved theoretical understanding provides guidance to users
regarding method selection, and choice of target condition number. The new
theory shows that, for the same target condition number, both methods increase
variances compared to the original matrix, with larger increases for ridge
regression than the minimum eigenvalue method. We prove that the ridge
regression method strictly decreases the absolute value of off-diagonal
correlations. Theoretical comparison of the impact of reconditioning and
multiplicative variance inflation on the data assimilation objective function
shows that variance inflation alters information across all scales uniformly,
whereas reconditioning has a larger effect on scales corresponding to smaller
eigenvalues. The minimum eigenvalue method results in smaller overall changes
to the correlation matrix than ridge regression, but can increase off-diagonal
correlations. Data assimilation experiments reveal that reconditioning corrects
spurious noise in the analysis but underestimates the true signal compared to

detect lensing at a significance of 8.7$\sigma$(6.7$\sigma$) with the

other interactions makes the quantum break-time shorter. The requirement that
this must not happen puts severe constraints on scalar potentials, essentially
suppressing the self-reproduction regimes. In particular, it eliminates both
local and global minima with positive energy densities and imposes a general
upper bound on the number of e-foldings in any given Hubble patch.
Consequently, maxima and other tachyonic directions must be curved stronger

transition (GLT). This model, GLTofDE, surprisingly provides a framework to
study not only temporal tensions in cosmology e.g. $H_0$ tension but also
spatial anomalies of CMB e.g. the hemispherical power asymmetry and
quadrupole-octopole alignment. In the mean field (or Landau) approximation of
GLTofDE, there is a spontaneously symmetry breaking exactly like the Higgs
potential. We modeled this transition, phenomenologically, and showed that
GLTofDE can resolve both the $H_0$ tension and Lyman-$\alpha$ anomaly in a
non-trivial way. According to $\chi^2$-analysis the transition happens at
$z_t=0.738\pm0.028$ while $H_0=71.89\pm0.93$ km/s/Mpc and
$\Omega^{like}_{k}=-0.225\pm0.049$ which are consistent with the latest $H(z)$
reconstructions. In addition, the GLTofDE proposes a framework to address the
CMB anomalies when it is considered beyond the mean field approximation. In
this regime existence of a long wavelength mode is a typical consequence which
is named the Goldstone mode in the case of continuous symmetries. This mode,
which is an automatic byproduct in GLTofDE, makes cosmological constant,
direction dependent. This means one side of the sky should be colder than the
other side in agreement with what has been already observed in CMB. In addition
between initial stochastic pattern and the final state with one long wavelength
mode, we can observe smaller patches or protrusions of the biggest remaining
patch in the simulation. Our simulations show these protrusions are few in
numbers and will be evolved according to Alan-Cahn mechanism. These protrusions
can give an additional effect on CMB which is the existence of aligned
quadrupole-octopole mode and its direction should be orthogonal to the dipole
direction. We conclude that GLTofDE is a fertile framework both theoretically
and phenomenologically.

it to compute the spectrum of the breakout emission. The model incorporates
photon escape through the finite optical depth wind, assuming a diffusion

exhibit substantial decrease (roughly by one order of magnitude) during
breakout, when the flux is still rising, because of the photon generation by
the shock compression associated with the photon escape. We also derive a
closure relation between the breakout duration, peak luminosity, and

normalized to a reference population of Horizontal Branch (HB) stars, has been
found to be a powerful indicator of the dynamical evolution reached by a
Globular Cluster (GC). In particular, observations suggest that the BSS
distribution bimodality is modulated by the dynamical age of the host GC, with
dynamically unrelaxed GCs showing a flat BSS distribution, and more relaxed GCs
showing a minimum at a radius that increases for increasing dynamical age,
resulting in a natural dynamical clock. While direct N-body simulations are
able to reproduce the general trend, thus supporting its dynamical origin, the
migration of the minimum of the distribution appears to be noisy and not well
defined. Here we show that a simple unidimensional model based on dynamical
friction (drift) and Brownian motion (diffusion) correctly reproduces the
qualitative motion of the minimum, without adjustable parameters except for the
BSS to HB stars mass-ratio. Differential dynamical friction effects combine
with diffusion in creating a bimodality in the BSS distribution and determining
its evolution, driving the migration of the minimum to larger radii over time.
The diffusion coefficient is strongly constrained by the need to reproduce the
migratory behaviour of the minimum, and the radial dependence of diffusion set
by fundamental physical arguments automatically satisfies this constraint.
Therefore, our model appears to capture the fluctuation-dissipation dynamics
that underpins the dynamical clock.

the suppression of the electron anomalous magnetic moment with respect to the

enhancement of the muon one induced by the CP-even component.

line of atomic carbon [C I]$(^3P_1\,-\,^{3}P_0)$ in far infrared-selected
galaxies on the main sequence at $z\sim1.2$ in the COSMOS field. We compare our
sample with a comprehensive compilation of data available in the literature for
local and high-redshift starbursting systems and quasars. We show that the [C
I]($^3P_1$$\rightarrow$$^3P_0$) luminosity correlates on global scales with the
infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$ similarly to low-$J$ CO transitions. We report
a systematic variation of $L'_{\rm [C\,I]^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0}$/$L_{\rm IR}$ as a
function of the galaxy type, with the ratio being larger for main-sequence
galaxies than for starbursts and sub-millimeter galaxies at fixed $L_{\rm IR}$.
The $L'_{\rm [C\,I]^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0}$/$L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}$ and $M_{\rm{[C
I]}}$/$M_{\rm dust}$ mass ratios are similar for main-sequence galaxies and for
local and high-redshift starbursts within a 0.2 dex intrinsic scatter,
suggesting that [C I] is a good tracer of molecular gas mass as CO and dust. We
derive a fraction of $f_{\rm{[C\,I]}} = M_{\rm{[C\,I]}} / M_{\rm{C}}\sim3-13$%
of the total carbon mass in the atomic neutral phase. Moreover, we estimate the
neutral atomic carbon abundance, the fundamental ingredient to calibrate [C I]
as a gas tracer, by comparing $L'_{\rm [C\,I]^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0}$ and available
gas masses from CO lines and dust emission. We find lower [C I] abundances in
main-sequence galaxies than in starbursting systems and sub-millimeter
galaxies, as a consequence of the canonical $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ and gas-to-dust
conversion factors. This argues against the application to different galaxy
populations of a universal standard [C I] abundance derived from highly biased
samples.

scenarios based on the statistically similar weak-lensing maps they generate.
Modified gravity (MG) models that include massive neutrinos can mimic the
standard concordance model ($\Lambda$CDM) in terms of Gaussian weak-lensing
observables. An inability to distinguish viable models that are based on
different physics potentially limits a deeper understanding of the fundamental
nature of cosmic acceleration. For a fixed redshift of sources, we demonstrate
that a machine learning network trained on simulated convergence maps can
discriminate between such models better than conventional higher-order
statistics. Results improve further when multiple source redshifts are
combined. To accelerate training, we implement a novel data compression
strategy that incorporates our prior knowledge of the morphology of typical
convergence map features. Our method fully distinguishes $\Lambda$CDM from its
most similar MG model on noise-free data, and it correctly identifies among the
MG models with at least 80% accuracy when using the full redshift information.
Adding noise lowers the correct classification rate of all models, but the
neural network still significantly outperforms the peak statistics used in a
previous analysis.

the standard superspace treatment, superfields are functions of the coordinates
$(x^\mu,\theta^\alpha, \theta^{\dagger \dot{\alpha}})$, and supersymmetry
preservation is manifest at the Lagrangian level in part due to the inclusion
of auxiliary $F$- and $D$-term components. By contrast, collinear superspace
depends on a smaller set of coordinates $(x^\mu,\eta,\eta^\dagger)$, where
$\eta$ is a complex Grassmann number without a spinor index. This provides a
formulation of supersymmetric theories that depends exclusively on propagating
degrees of freedom, at the expense of obscuring Lorentz invariance and
introducing inverse momentum scales. After establishing the general framework,
we construct collinear superspace Lagrangians for free chiral matter and
non-Abelian gauge fields. For the latter construction, an important ingredient
is a superfield representation that is simultaneously chiral, anti-chiral, and
real; this novel object encodes residual gauge transformations on the light
cone. Additionally, we discuss a fundamental obstruction to constructing
interacting theories with chiral matter; overcoming these issues is the subject
of our companion paper, where we introduce a larger set of superfields to
realize the full range of interactions compatible with $\mathcal{N} = 1$. Along
the way, we provide a novel framing of reparametrization invariance using a

the formation of star clusters in galaxy formation simulations. Here we
investigate how dissolution of bound star clusters affects the shape of the
cluster mass function and the metallicity distribution of surviving clusters.
Cluster evolution includes the loss of stars that become unbound due to tidal
disruption as well as mass-loss due to stellar evolution. We calculate the
tidal tensor along cluster trajectories and use it to estimate the
instantaneous mass-loss rate. The typical tidal tensor exhibits large
variations on a time-scale of $\sim100$~Myr, with maximum eigenvalue of
$10^7$~Gyr$^{-2}$, and median value of $10^4$~Gyr$^{-2}$ for the first Gyr
after cluster formation. As a result of dynamical disruption, at the final
available output of our simulations at redshift $z\approx1.5$, the cluster mass
function has an approximately log-normal shape peaked at $\sim10^{4.3}M_\odot$.
Extrapolation of the disruption to $z=0$ results in too many low-mass clusters
compared to the observed Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Over 70\% of GC
candidates are completely disrupted before the present; only 10\% of the total
GC candidate mass remains in surviving clusters. The total mass of surviving
clusters at $z=0$ varies from run to run in the range $(2-6)\times10^7M_\odot$,
consistent with the observed mass of GC systems in Milky Way-sized galaxies.
The metallicity distributions of all massive star clusters and of the surviving
GCs have similar shapes but different normalization because of cluster
disruption. The model produces a larger fraction of very metal-poor clusters
than observed. A robust prediction of the model is the age-metallicity
relation, in which metal-rich clusters are systematically younger than
metal-poor clusters by up to 3~Gyr.

detection. However, much less work has been done addressing the natural
follow-up question: how to make valid inferences for the magnitude of those
signals after selection. Ordinary Bayesian credible intervals suffer from
selection bias, owing to the fact that the target of inference is chosen
adaptively. Existing Bayesian approaches for correcting this bias produce
credible intervals with poor frequentist properties, while existing frequentist
approaches require sacrificing the benefits of shrinkage typical in Bayesian
methods, resulting in confidence intervals that are needlessly wide. We address
this gap by proposing a nonparametric empirical-Bayes approach for constructing
optimal selection-adjusted confidence sets. Our method produces confidence sets
that are as short as possible on average, while both adjusting for selection
and maintaining exact frequentist coverage uniformly over the parameter space.
Our main theoretical result establishes an important consistency property of
our procedure: that under mild conditions, it asymptotically converges to the
results of an oracle-Bayes analysis in which the prior distribution of signal
sizes is known exactly. Across a series of examples, the method outperforms
existing frequentist techniques for post-selection inference, producing
confidence sets that are notably shorter but with the same coverage guarantee.

from compressive to tensile with La doping. It also shows that the hole
occupancy of the O 2p and Ru 4d orbitals display the same trend as a function
of $\Delta/\lambda$, thus validating the minimal hybridization model. In
essence, our results suggest that the predominant mechanism driving the
emergence of the low-temperature metallic phase in La doped Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is
the structurally induced redistribution of holes within the t2g orbitals,
rather that the injection of free carriers.

mag at peak. Spectra taken a few days after peak show an unusual and strong
absorption line centered near 3200\AA\ that we identify with Co II, suggesting
a high fraction of synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the ejecta. By $\sim\!1$ month
after peak, SN2017dwh became much redder than other SLSNe-I, instead strongly
resembling broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (Ic-BL SNe) with clear suppression of
the flux redward of $\sim\!5000$ \AA, providing further evidence for a large
mass of Fe-group elements. Late-time upper limits indicate a $^{56}$Ni mass of
$\lesssim 0.6$ M$_\odot$, leaving open the possibility that SN2017dwh produced
a $^{56}$Ni mass comparable to SN1998bw ($\approx\!0.4$ M$_\odot$). Fitting the
light curve with a combined magnetar and $^{56}$Ni model using ${\tt MOSFiT}$,
we find that the light curve can easily accommodate such masses without
affecting the inferred magnetar parameters. We also find that SN2017dwh
occurred in the least-luminous detected host galaxy to date for a SLSN-I, with
$M_{B} = -13.5$ mag and an implied metallicity of $Z\!\sim\!0.08$ $Z_\odot$.
The spectral properties of SN2017dwh provide new evidence linking SLSNe-I with
Type Ic-BL SNe, and in particular the high Fe-group abundance may be due to
enhanced $^{56}$Ni production or mixing due to asphericity. Finally, we find
that SN2017dwh represents the most extreme end of a correlation between
continuum shape and Co II absorption strength in the near-peak spectra of
SLSNe-I, indicating that Fe-group abundance likely accounts for some of the
variation in their spectral shapes.

substitution Yb on Ti B-sites, extended defects such as dissociated
superdislocations and anti-phase boundaries were discovered for the first time

charge-storage capacity with increasing charge/discharge rate. For example,
improving this rate-performance is required for fast-charging of car batteries.
Rate-performance is related to the timescales associated with charge or ionic
motion in both electrode and electrolyte. However, no quantitative model exists
which can be used to fit experimental data to give insights into the dominant
rate-limiting processes in a given electrode-electrolyte system. Here we
develop an equation which can be used to fit capacity versus rate data,
outputting three parameters which fully describe rate-performance. Most
important is the characteristic time associated with charge/discharge which can
be expressed by a simple equation with terms describing each rate-limiting
process, thus linking rate-performance to measurable physical parameters. We
have fitted these equations to ~200 data sets from ~50 papers, finding
exceptional agreement, and allowing parameters such as diffusion coefficients
or electrolyte conductivities to be extracted. By estimating relevant physical
parameters, it is possible to show which rate-limiting processes are dominant
in a given situation, facilitating rational design and cell optimization. In
addition, this model predicts the upper speed limit for Li/Na ion batteries, in
agreement with the fastest electrodes in the literature.

carbon is positively correlated with the visual extinction, $A_V$, and the
strength of the 2175 \AA\ dust extinction feature, $A_{\mathrm{bump}}$. GRBs
with CI detected in absorption are all observed above a certain threshold of
$\log N$(HI)$/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ + [X/H] > 20.7 and a dust-phase iron column
density of $\log N$(Fe)$_{\mathrm{dust}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ > 16.2. In contrast
to the SED-derived dust properties, the strength of the CI absorption does not
correlate with the depletion-derived dust properties. This indicates that the
GRB CI absorbers trace dusty systems where the dust composition is dominated by
carbon-rich dust grains. The observed higher metal and dust column densities of
the GRB CI absorbers compared to H$_2$- and CI-bearing quasar absorbers is
mainly a consequence of how the two absorber populations are selected, but is
also required in the presence of intense UV radiation fields in actively
star-forming galaxies.

of computer vision and natural language processing, at the expense of growing
model sizes and computational complexity. Deploying these models on low power
and mobile devices poses a challenge due to their limited compute capabilities
and strict energy budgets. One solution that has generated significant research
interest is deploying highly quantized models that operate on low precision
inputs and weights less than eight bits, trading off accuracy for performance.
These models have a significantly reduced memory footprint (up to 32x
reduction) and can replace multiply-accumulates with bitwise operations during
compute intensive convolution and fully connected layers.
  Most deep learning frameworks rely on highly engineered linear algebra
libraries such as ATLAS or Intel's MKL to implement efficient deep learning
operators. To date, none of the popular deep learning directly support low
precision operators, partly due to a lack of optimized low precision libraries.
In this paper we introduce a work flow to quickly generate high performance low
precision deep learning operators for arbitrary precision that target multiple
CPU architectures and include optimizations such as memory tiling and
vectorization. We present an extensive case study on low power ARM Cortex-A53
CPU, and show how we can generate 1-bit, 2-bit convolutions with speedups up to
16x over an optimized 16-bit integer baseline and 2.3x better than handwritten
implementations.

  It is based on the approaches by Schoof and Pila in a more favorable case

introduced by Gaudry, Kohel, and Smith in genus 2. To deal with these kernels
in any genus, we adapt a technique that the author, Gaudry, and Spaenlehauer

Applying this technique to the kernels, the systems we obtain are much smaller

  Our main result is that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that, for any
fixed $g$, this algorithm has expected time and space complexity $O((\log

$c\le 9$ and we also conjecture that the result still holds for $c=7$.

preconditioners for the SN transport equation when discretized with a
high-order (HO) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. DSA preconditioners
address the need to accelerate solving SN transport when the mean free path
$\varepsilon$ of particles is small and the condition number of the SN
transport equation scales like $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. By expanding the SN
transport operator in $\varepsilon$ and employing a singular matrix
perturbation analysis, we derive a DSA matrix that reduces to the symmetric
interior penalty (SIP) DG discretization of diffusion when the mesh is
first-order and the total opacity is constant. We prove that preconditioning HO
DG SN transport with the SIP DSA matrix results in an $O(\varepsilon)$
perturbation of the identity, and fixed-point iteration therefore converges
rapidly for optically thick problems. However, the SIP DSA matrix is
conditioned like $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$, making it difficult to invert for small
$\varepsilon$. We further derive a new two-part, additive DSA preconditioner
based on a continuous discretization of diffusion-reaction, which has a
condition number independent of $\varepsilon$, and prove that this DSA variant
has the same theoretical efficiency as the SIP DSA preconditioner in the
optically thick limit. The analysis is extended to the case of HO (curved)
meshes, where so-called mesh cycles can result from elements both being upwind
of each other. In particular, we prove that performing two additional transport
sweeps between DSA steps yields the same theoretical conditioning of
fixed-point iterations as in the cycle-free case. Theoretical results are
validated by numerical experiments on HO, highly curved meshes generated from
an ALE hydrodynamics code, where the additional inner sweeps between DSA steps
offer up to a 4x reduction in total sweeps.

the angular momentum conserving (AMC) model, and the equal-area model on the

a Hadley circulation must span: all latitudes where the radiative convective
equilibrium (RCE) absolute angular momentum ($M_\mathrm{rce}$) satisfies
$M_\mathrm{rce}>\Omega a^2$ or $M_\mathrm{rce}<0$ or where the RCE absolute
vorticity ($\eta_\mathrm{rce}$) satisfies $f\eta_\mathrm{rce}<0$; all latitudes
where the RCE zonal wind exceeds the AMC zonal wind; and over a range such that
depth-averaged potential temperature is continuous and that energy is
conserved. The AMC model requires knowledge of the ascent latitude
$\varphi_\mathrm{a}$, which need not equal the RCE forcing maximum latitude
$\varphi_\mathrm{m}$. Whatever the value of $\varphi_\mathrm{a}$, we
demonstrate that an AMC cell must extend at least as far into the winter
hemisphere as the summer hemisphere. The equal-area model predicts
$\varphi_\mathrm{a}$, always placing it poleward of $\varphi_\mathrm{m}$. As
$\varphi_\mathrm{m}$ is moved poleward (at a given thermal Rossby number), the
equal-area predicted Hadley circulation becomes implausibly large, while both
$\varphi_\mathrm{m}$ and $\varphi_\mathrm{a}$ become increasingly displaced
poleward of the minimal cell extent based on Hide's theorem (i.e. of
supercritical forcing). In an idealized dry general circulation model,
cross-equatorial Hadley cells are generated, some spanning nearly pole-to-pole.
All homogenize angular momentum imperfectly, are roughly symmetric in extent
about the equator, and appear in extent controlled by the span of supercritical
forcing.

In this paper, we propose a class of Krylov implicit integration factor (IIF)
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods on sparse grids to solve reaction-diffusion

discretization is the multiwavelet bases on nested sparse grids, which can
significantly reduce the numbers of degrees of freedom. To deal with the
stiffness of the DG spatial operator in discretizing reaction-diffusion

class of exponential integrators. Krylov subspace approximations are used to
evaluate the large size matrix exponentials resulting from IIF schemes for
solving PDEs on high spatial dimensions. Stability and error analysis for the
semi-discrete scheme are performed. Numerical examples of both scalar equations
and systems in two and three spatial dimensions are provided to demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of the methods. The stiffness of the reaction-diffusion

However, little exists in the literature that provides a thorough understanding

commonly used distributed training approaches for TF can be categorized as
follows: 1) Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC), 2) gRPC+X: X=(InfiniBand

Allreduce with MPI, Horovod with MPI, and Horovod with NVIDIA NCCL. In this
paper, we provide an in-depth performance characterization and analysis of
these distributed training approaches on various GPU clusters including the Piz
Daint system (6 on Top500). We perform experiments to gain novel insights along
the following vectors: 1) Application-level scalability of DNN training, 2)
Effect of Batch Size on scaling efficiency, 3) Impact of the MPI library used
for no-gRPC approaches, and 4) Type and size of DNN architectures. Based on
these experiments, we present two key insights: 1) Overall, No-gRPC designs
achieve better performance compared to gRPC-based approaches for most

gradient aggregation using Allreduce. Finally, we propose a truly CUDA-Aware
MPI Allreduce design that exploits CUDA kernels and pointer caching to perform
large reductions efficiently. Our proposed designs offer 5-17X better
performance than NCCL2 for small and medium messages, and reduces latency by
29% for large messages. The proposed optimizations help Horovod-MPI to achieve
approximately 90% scaling efficiency for ResNet-50 training on 64 GPUs.
Further, Horovod-MPI achieves 1.8X and 3.2X higher throughput than the native

equations in turbulent regimes are performed. The behavior of the flow is
either dominated by purely turbulent phenomena or by the generation of sound
waves in it. Previous studies suggest that three different types of turbulence
may happen at the low Mach number limit in polytropic flows: Nearly
incompressible (NI), modally equipartitioned compressible (MEC) and
compressible wave (CW). The distinction between these types of turbulence is
investigated here applying different kinds of forcing. Scaling of density
fluctuations with Mach number, comparison of the ratio of transverse velocity
fluctuations to longitudinal fluctuations and spectral decomposition of
fluctuations are used to distinguish the nature of these solutions. From the
study of the spatio-temporal spectra and correlation times we quantify the
contribution of the waves to the total energy of the system. Also, in the
dynamics of a compressible flow, three associated correlation times are
considered: the non-linear time of local interaction between scales, the
sweeping time or non-local time of large scales on small scales, and the time
associated with acoustic waves (sound). We observed that different correlation
times dominate depending on the wave number (k), the Mach number and the type

reconstruction in order to perform lossy image compression. In this paradigm,
one human describes images to a second human, whose task is to reconstruct the

holographic equipartition models. In this model, an extra driving term
(corresponding to a time-varying cosmological term) in cosmological equations
depends on an associated entropy on the horizon of the universe. The driving
term is expected to be constrained by the second law of thermodynamics, as if
the cosmological constant problem could be discussed from a thermodynamics
viewpoint. In the present study, an arbitrary entropy on the horizon, $S_{H}$,
is assumed, extending previous analysis based on particular entropies [Phys.
Rev. D 96, 103507 (2017); (arXiv:1707.09101)]. The arbitrary entropy is applied
to the holographic equipartition model, in order to universally examine
thermodynamic constraints on the driving term in a flat
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universe at late times. The second law of
thermodynamics for the holographic equipartition model is found to constrain
the upper limit of the driving term, even if the arbitrary entropy is assumed.
The upper limit implies that the order of the driving term is likely consistent
with the order of the cosmological constant measured by observations. An
approximately equivalent upper limit can be obtained from the positivity of
$S_{H}$ in the holographic equipartition model.

trends in which emission line strength and color are associated with changes in

wavelength dependence of quasar variability as a function of change in

the differential spectrum follows a power law at longer wavelengths that breaks
blueward of 1700 \AA. However, the shape of the differential spectrum, the
location of the power law break, and the slope of the intrinsic Baldwin Effect
all vary with the choice of bandpass used to define the change in quasar

inhomogeneous accretion or slim accretion disk models where delays in the
reprocessing of incident light on the accretion disk cause local deviations in
temperature from the thin disk model. Finally, we quantify the effects on
cosmology studies due to the variations in the quasar spectrum in the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest wavelength range. Using the observed spectroscopic

that the empirical distribution of detection times converges to the stationary

passing the empirical distribution through a filter matched to the stationary

recovery of arrival distribution from detection distribution as a nonlinear

By comparing per-detection Fisher information for depth estimation from high-

possible improvement of ranging performance resulting from the presence of dead

pulsation, detected with NuSTAR at 8.68917s, was found to be also
phase-modulated (at 98 percent confidence or higher) at the same 55 ks period,
or half that value. Furthermore, a brief analysis of another Suzaku data set of

15-40 keV pulses. Thus, the hard X-ray pulse-phase modulation was detected with
Suzaku (in 2009 and 2013) and NuSTAR (in 2014) at a consistent period. However,
the modulation amplitude varied significantly; A=0.17 s with Suzaku (2009),
A=1.2 s with Suzaku (2013), and A=0.17 s with NuSTAR. In addition, the phase
modulation properties detected with NuSTAR differed considerably between the
first 1/3 and the latter 2/3 of the observation. In energies below 10 keV, the
pulse-phase modulation was not detected with either Suzaku or NuSTAR. These
results reinforce the view of Makishima et al. (2014); the neutron star in
4U0142+61 keeps free precession, under a slight axial deformation due probably
to ultra-strong toroidal magnetic fields of 1e16 G. The wobbling angle of
precession should remain constant, but the pulse-phase modulation amplitude
varies on time scales of months to years, presumably as asymmetry of the hard
X-ray emission pattern around the star's axis changes.

distributed computing has served as a natural and dominating paradigm for
statistical inference. However, the existing literature on parallel inference
almost exclusively focuses on Euclidean data and parameters. While this
assumption is valid for many applications, it is increasingly more common to
encounter problems where the data or the parameters lie on a non-Euclidean
space, like a manifold for example. Our work aims to fill a critical gap in the
literature by generalizing parallel inference algorithms to optimization on
manifolds. We show that our proposed algorithm is both communication efficient
and carries theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, we demonstrate the
performance of our algorithm to the estimation of Fr\'echet means on simulated
spherical data and the low-rank matrix completion problem over Grassmann
manifolds applied to the Netflix prize data set.

minor slope variations and no absorption features. The NIR data is minimally

low velocities lead to temperatures higher than the olivine solidus, for which

Vs anomalies also suggest that temperature anomalies are unlikely to be the
sole factor because Vs is more sensitive to temperature than Vp. In this study,
we attribute the velocity anomalies to elevated water and orthopyroxene (Opx)

stresses using three-dimensional numerical models subjected to a loading
similar to the regional stresses. The models assume a Maxwell viscoelastic

allows for sub-solidus variations in temperature. However, any combination of
water content and temperature anomalies fails to yield Vp and Vs anomalies of a

thicken under external forcing, but also jam into a solid-like state that is
fully reversible when the force is removed. An impact on the surface of a dense
suspension can trigger this jamming process by generating a shear front that
propagates into the bulk of the system. Tracking and visualizing such a front
is difficult because suspensions are optically opaque and the front can
propagate as fast as several meters per second. Recently, high-speed ultrasound
imaging has been used to overcome this problem and extract two-dimensional
sections of the flow field associated with jamming front propagation. Here we
extend this method to reconstruct the three-dimensional flow field. This
enables us to investigate the evolution of jamming fronts for which axisymmetry
cannot be assumed, such as impact at angles tilted away from the normal to the
free surface of the suspension. We find that sufficiently far from solid
boundaries the resulting flow field is approximately identical to that
generated by normal impact, but rotated and aligned with the angle of impact.
However, once the front approaches the solid boundary at the bottom of the
container, it generates a squeeze flow that deforms the front profile and
causes jamming to proceed in a non-axisymmetric manner.

To guarantee the stability and safety of a car during iEPB braking, the rear
slip ratio has to be controlled accurately within the optimized value to get
the shortest brake distance without undesired loss of control. In this paper, a
sliding-mode controller (SMC) is investigated to achieve rear-wheel anti-lock

co-simulated by these two software simultaneously with different road

found instead that LBVs are considerably more isolated than either O-type stars
or WRs, with a distribution intermediate between that of the WRs and red
supergiants (RSGs). A similar study, using a more restricted sample of LBVs,
reached the opposite conclusion. Both studies relied upon the distance to the
nearest spectroscopically identified O-type star to define the degree of
isolation. However, our knowledge of the spectroscopic content of the LMC is
quite spotty. Here we re-examine the issue using carefully defined photometric
criteria to select the highest mass unevolved stars (""bright blue stars,"" or
BBSs), using spatially complete photometric catalogs of the LMC, M31, and M33.
Our study finds that the LBVs are no more isolated than BBSs or WRs. This
result holds no matter which sample of LBVs we employ. A statistical test shows
that we can rule out the LBVs having the same distribution as the RSGs, which
are about 2x more isolated. We demonstrate the robustness of our results using
the second-closest neighbor. Furthermore, the majority of LBVs in the LMC are
found in or near OB associations as are the BBS and WRs; the RSGs are not. We
conclude that the spatial distribution of LBVs therefore is consistent with the

devices could receive some financial reward such as Bitcoin. However,
side-channel attacks, which aim to exploit some information leaked from the IoT
devices during data trade execution, are possible since most of the IoT devices

realize data trading in IoT environment due to the information leakage such as
leaking the private key for signing a Bitcoin transaction in Bitcoin system. In
this paper, we propose LRCoin, a kind of leakage-resilient cryptocurrency based
on bitcoin in which the signature algorithm used for authenticating bitcoin
transactions is leakage-resilient. LRCoin is suitable for the scenarios where
information leakage is inevitable such as IoT applications. Our core
contribution is proposing an efficient bilinear-based
continual-leakage-resilient ECDSA signature. We prove the proposed signature

energy. We describe a smart solar inverter system with battery which can either
operate in an automatic mode or receive commands over a network to charge and
discharge at a given rate. In order to make battery storage financially viable
and advantageous to the consumers, effective battery scheduling algorithms can
be employed. Particularly, when time-of-use tariffs are in effect in the region
of the inverter, it is possible in some cases to schedule the battery to save
money for the individual customer, compared to the ""automatic"" mode. Hence,
this paper presents and evaluates the performance of a novel battery scheduling
algorithm for residential consumers of solar energy. The proposed battery
scheduling algorithm optimizes the cost of electricity over next 24 hours for
residential consumers. The cost minimization is realized by controlling the
charging/discharging of battery storage system based on the predictions for
load and solar power generation values. The scheduling problem is formulated as
a linear programming problem. We performed computer simulations over 83
inverters using several months of hourly load and PV data. The simulation
results indicate that key factors affecting the viability of optimization are
the tariffs and the PV to Load ratio at each inverter. Depending on the tariff,
savings of between 1% and 10% can be expected over the automatic approach. The
prediction approach used in this paper is also shown to out-perform basic
""persistence"" forecasting approaches. We have also examined the approaches for

transactive market, where each player can participate in the market as seller
or buyer and tries to maximize its welfare individually. Market players send
their demand and supply to a local data center, where clearing price is
determined to balance demand and supply. The topology of the grid and
associated network constraints are considered to compute a price signal in the
data center to keep the system secure by applying this signal to the
corresponding players. The proposed approach needs only the demanded/supplied
power by each player to reach global optimum which means that utility and cost
function parameters would remain private. Also, this approach uses distributed
method by applying local market clearing price as coordination information and
direct load flow (DLF) for power flow calculation saving computation resources
and making it suitable for online and automatic operation for a market with a
large number of players. The proposed method is tested on a market with 50
players and simulation results show that the convergence is guaranteed and the
proposed distributed method can reach the same result as conventional
centralized approach.

border with Russia in Northeast China. Little is known about the foraging
strategies of this small subpopulation in Hunchun Nature Reserve on the Chinese
side of the border; at this location, the prey base and land use patterns are
distinctly different from those in the larger population of the Sikhote-Alin
Mountains of Russia. Using dietary analysis of scats and camera-trapping data
from Hunchun Nature Reserve, we assessed spatiotemporal overlap of tigers and
their prey and identified prey selection patterns to enhance understanding of
the ecological requirements of tigers in Northeast China. Results indicated
that wild prey constituted 94.9% of the total biomass consumed by tigers;
domestic livestock represented 5.1% of the diet. Two species, wild boar and
sika deer , collectively represented 83% of the biomass consumed by tigers.
Despite lower spatial overlap of tigers and wild boar compared to tigers and
sika deer, tigers preferentially preyed on boar, likely facilitated by high
temporal overlap in activity patterns. Tigers exhibit significant spatial
overlap with sika deer, likely favoring a high level of tiger predation on this
large-sized ungulate. However, tigers did not preferred roe deer (Capreolus
pygargus) and showed a low spatial overlap with roe deer. Overall, our results
suggest that tiger prey selection is determined by prey body size and also
overlap in tiger and prey use of time or space. Also, we suggest that
strategies designed to minimize livestock forays into forested lands may be
important for decreasing the livestock depredation by tigers. This study offers
a framework to simultaneously integrate food habit analysis with the
distribution of predators and prey through time and space to provide a
comprehensive understanding of foraging strategies of large carnivores.

is based on probabilistic modeling of the ensemble's trees, followed by model
clustering via Bregman divergence. This allows us to find a minimal set of
models that provides an accurate description of the trees, and at the same time
is small enough to store and maintain. Our compression scheme demonstrates high
compression rates on a variety of modern datasets. Importantly, our scheme
enables predictions from the compressed format and a perfect reconstruction of

to enhance the computing capability of hardware-constrained wireless devices

has a sequence of tasks to execute. In particular, we consider task dependency
between the two WDs, where the input of a task at one WD requires the final
task output at the other WD. Under the considered task-dependency model, we
study the optimal task offloading policy and resource allocation (e.g., on
offloading transmit power and local CPU frequencies) that minimize the weighted
sum of the WDs' energy consumption and task execution time. The problem is
challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the offloading decisions among
all tasks and the strong coupling with resource allocation. To tackle this
problem, we first assume that the offloading decisions are given and derive the
closed-form expressions of the optimal offloading transmit power and local CPU
frequencies. Then, an efficient bi-section search method is proposed to obtain
the optimal solutions. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal offloading
decisions follow an one-climb policy, based on which a reduced-complexity Gibbs
Sampling algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal offloading decisions. We
then extend the investigation to a general multi-user scenario, where the input
of a task at one WD requires the final task outputs from multiple other WDs.
Numerical results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform

challenge is automatic control of laser bone ablation with 4D optical coherence
tomography (OCT). OCT as high resolution imaging modality provides volumetric
images of tissue and foresees information of bone position and orientation
(pose) as well as thickness. However, existing approaches for OCT based laser
ablation control rely on external tracking systems or invasively ablated
artificial landmarks for tracking the pose of the OCT probe relative to the
tissue. This can be superseded by estimating the scene flow caused by relative
movement between OCT-based laser ablation system and patient.
  Therefore, this paper deals with 2.5D scene flow estimation of volumetric OCT
images for application in laser ablation. We present a semi-supervised
convolutional neural network based tracking scheme for subsequent 3D OCT
volumes and apply it to a realistic semi-synthetic data set of ex vivo human
temporal bone specimen. The scene flow is estimated in a two-stage approach. In
the first stage, 2D lateral scene flow is computed on census-transformed
en-face arguments-of-maximum intensity projections. Subsequent to this, the
projections are warped by predicted lateral flow and 1D depth flow is
estimated. The neural network is trained semi-supervised by combining error to
ground truth and the reconstruction error of warped images with assumptions of
spatial flow smoothness. Quantitative evaluation reveals a mean endpoint error
of $ (4.7\pm{}3.5) $ voxel or $ 27.5 \pm 20.5 \mu\mathrm{m} $ for scene flow
estimation caused by simulated relative movement between the OCT probe and
bone. The scene flow estimation for 4D OCT enables its use for markerless
tracking of mastoid bone structures for image guidance in general, and
automated laser ablation control.

designs a learning algorithm based on a sophisticated deep reinforcement

learning approaches has recently become a popular field of research. In this
paper, we propose a mask-based speech enhancement framework by using
concatenated identical deep neural networks (CI-DNNs). The idea is that a
single DNN is trained under multiple input and output signal-to-noise power
ratio (SNR) conditions, using targets that provide a moderate SNR gain with
respect to the input and therefore achieve a balance between speech component
quality and noise suppression. We concatenate this single DNN several times
without any retraining to provide enough noise attenuation. Simulation results
show that our proposed CI-DNN outperforms enhancement methods using classical
spectral weighting rules w.r.t. total speech quality and speech
intelligibility. Moreover, our approach shows similar or even a little bit
better performance with much fewer trainable parameters compared with a
noisy-target single DNN approach of the same size. A comparison to the
conventional clean-target single DNN approach shows that our proposed CI-DNN is
better in speech component quality and much better in residual noise component
quality. Most importantly, our new CI-DNN generalized best to an unseen noise
type, if compared to the other tested deep learning approaches.

stitching and rectangling as two separate steps, which may result in suboptimal
results as the stitching process is not aware of the further warping needs for
rectangling. We address these limitations by formulating image stitching with
regular boundaries in a unified optimization. Starting from the initial
stitching results produced by traditional warping-based optimization, we obtain
the irregular boundary from the warped meshes by polygon Boolean operations
which robustly handle arbitrary mesh compositions, and by analyzing the
irregular boundary construct a piecewise rectangular boundary. Based on this,
we further incorporate straight line preserving and regular boundary
constraints into the image stitching framework, and conduct iterative
optimization to obtain an optimal piecewise rectangular boundary, thus can make
the panoramic boundary as close as possible to a rectangle, while reducing
unwanted distortions. We further extend our method to panoramic videos and
selfie photography, by integrating the temporal coherence and portrait
preservation into the optimization. Experiments show that our method
efficiently produces visually pleasing panoramas with regular boundaries and
unnoticeable distortions.

systems, and their pristine properties, is a key question for modern
astrophysics. The properties of the youngest disks, embedded in rotating
infalling protostellar envelopes, have largely remained unconstrained up to
now.
  In the framework of the IRAM-PdBI CALYPSO survey, we have obtained
sub-arcsecond observations of the dust continuum emission at 231 GHz and 94
GHz, for a sample of 16 solar-type Class 0 protostars. In an attempt to
identify disk-like structures embedded at small scales in the protostellar
envelopes, we model the dust continuum emission visibility profiles using both
Plummer-like envelope models and envelope models including additional Gaussian
disk-like components.
  Our analysis shows that in the CALYPSO sample, 11 of the 16 Class 0
protostars are better reproduced by models including a disk-like dust continuum
component contributing to the flux at small scales, but less than 25% of these
candidate protostellar disks are resolved at radii > 60 au. Including all
available literature constraints on Class 0 disks at subarcsecond scales, we
show that our results are representative: most (> 72% in a sample of 26
protostars) Class 0 protostellar disks are small and emerge only at radii < 60
au. Our multiplicity fraction at scales 100-5000 au is in global agreement with
the multiplicity properties of Class I protostars at similar scales.
  We confront our observational constraints on the disk size distribution in
Class 0 protostars to the typical disk properties from protostellar formation
models. Because they reduce the centrifugal radius, and produce a disk size
distribution peaking at radii <100 au during the main accretion phase,
magnetized models of rotating protostellar collapse are favored by our
observations.

gradually decreased until the middle of June. In this period, the X-ray
spectrum was described by Comptonization of the disk emission, with a photon
index of $\sim$1.5 and an electron temperature of $\sim$50 keV, which is
consistent with a black hole X-ray binary in the low/hard state. The electron
temperature and the photon index were slightly decreased and increased with
increasing flux, respectively. The source showed significant X-ray flux
variation on timescales of seconds. This short-term variation was found to be
associated with changes in the spectral shape, and the photon index became
slightly harder at higher fluxes. This suggests that the variation was produced
by a change in the properties of the hot electron cloud responsible for the
strong Comptonization. Modeling a multi-wavelength SED around the X-ray flux
peak at the end of March, covering the near-infrared to X-ray bands, we found
that the optical and near-infrared fluxes were likely contributed substantially
by the jet emission. Before this outburst, the source was never detected in the
X-ray band with MAXI (with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim$0.2 mCrab in 4--10
keV, obtained from the 7-year data in 2009--2016), whereas weak optical and
infrared activity was found at their flux levels $\sim$3 orders of magnitude

expectation is improper. The author proposed the CM-EM algorithm (CM means
Channel's Matching), which adds a step to optimize the mixture ratios for the
proper Shannon channel and maximizes G, average log-normalized-likelihood, in
the M-step. Neal and Hinton's Maximization-Maximization (MM) algorithm use F

The new convergence proof is similar to Beal's proof with the variational
method. It first proves that the minimum relative entropy equals the minimum
R-G (R is mutual information), then uses variational and iterative methods that
Shannon et al. use for rate-distortion functions to prove the global
convergence. Some examples show that Q and F should and may decrease in some

the atmospheres of tidally locked planets. Simulations, observations, and
simple models show that if these planets are sufficiently rapidly rotating,
their atmospheres have an eastward equatorial jet and a hot-spot east of the
substellar point. We linearize the shallow-water model about this eastward flow
and its associated height perturbation. The forced solutions of this system
show that the shear flow explains the form of the global circulation,
particularly the hot-spot shift and the positions of the cold standing waves on
the night-side.
  We suggest that the eastward hot-spot shift seen in observations and 3D
simulations of these atmospheres is caused by the zonal flow Doppler-shifting
the stationary wave response eastwards, summed with the height perturbation
from the flow itself. This differs from other studies which explained the
hot-spot shift as pure advection of heat from air flowing eastward from the
substellar point, or as equatorial waves travelling eastwards. We compare our
solutions to simulations in our climate model Exo-FMS, and show that the height
fields and wind patterns match.
  We discuss how planetary properties affect the global circulation, and how
they change observables such as the hot-spot shift or day-night contrast. We
conclude that the wave-mean flow interaction between the stationary planetary
waves and the equatorial jet is a vital part of the equilibrium circulation on
tidally locked planets.

optimization problems. Worst-case analysis often falls short of explaining this
performance. Because of this, ""beyond worst-case analysis"" of algorithms has
recently gained a lot of attention, including probabilistic analysis of
algorithms.
  The instances of many optimization problems are essentially a discrete metric
space. Probabilistic analysis for such metric optimization problems has
nevertheless mostly been conducted on instances drawn from Euclidean space,
which provides a structure that is usually heavily exploited in the analysis.
However, most instances from practice are not Euclidean. Little work has been
done on metric instances drawn from other, more realistic, distributions. Some
initial results have been obtained by Bringmann et al. (Algorithmica, 2013),
who have used random shortest path metrics on complete graphs to analyze
heuristics.
  The goal of this paper is to generalize these findings to non-complete
graphs, especially Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. A random shortest path
metric is constructed by drawing independent random edge weights for each edge
in the graph and setting the distance between every pair of vertices to the
length of a shortest path between them with respect to the drawn weights. For
such instances, we prove that the greedy heuristic for the minimum distance
maximum matching problem, the nearest neighbor and insertion heuristics for the
traveling salesman problem, and a trivial heuristic for the $k$-median problem
all achieve a constant expected approximation ratio. Additionally, we show a
polynomial upper bound for the expected number of iterations of the 2-opt
heuristic for the traveling salesman problem.

problematic for redundant calibration on MWA observations of EoR fields 1 and

highly-disturbed systems among QSO2. This is consistent with a scenario in
which galaxy interactions are the dominant mechanism triggering nuclear
activity at the highest AGN power. There is a strong dependence of galaxy
properties with AGN power (assuming $L_ {\rm [OIII]}$ is an adequate proxy).
The relative contribution of the spheroidal component to the total galaxy light

longitudinal acoustic phonons. A strong phonon impact is found in the
redistribution of exciton momenta on the exciton parabola that becomes
especially prominent for high temperatures and exciton distributions further
away from the exciton resonance which are optically dark. Despite their impact
on the energetic redistribution, acoustic phonons virtually do not affected the
exciton spin dynamics as the exciton-impurity interaction always dominates.
Furthermore, it turns out that the exciton spin lifetime increases by roughly
one order of magnitude for nonequilibrium hot exciton distributions and, in
addition, pronounced quantum kinetic signatures in the exciton spin dynamics

systems, it often fails in the presence of strong correlations where the
standard mean-field picture is qualitatively incorrect. In many cases, these
failures can be largely ameliorated by permitting the mean-field reference to
break physical symmetries. Symmetry-broken coupled cluster, e.g. Bogoliubov
coupled cluster, theory can indeed provide reasonably accurate energetic
predictions, but the broken symmetry can compromise the quality of the
resulting wave function and predictions of observables other than the energy.
  Merging symmetry projection and coupled cluster theory is therefore an
appealing way to describe strongly correlated systems. Independently, two
different but related formalisms have been recently proposed to achieve this
goal. The two formalisms are contrasted in this manuscript, with results tested
on the Richardson pairing Hamiltonian. Both formalisms are based on the
disentangled cluster representation of the symmetry-rotated coupled cluster
wavefunction. However, they differ in the way that the disentangled clusters
are solved. One approach sets up angle-dependent coupled cluster equations,
while the other involves first-order ordinary differential equations. The
latter approach yields energies and occupation probabilities significantly
better than those of number-projected BCS and BCS coupled cluster and, when the
disentangled clusters are truncated at low excitation levels, has a
computational cost not too much larger than that of BCS coupled cluster.
  The high quality of results presented in this manuscript indicates that
symmetry-projected coupled cluster is a promising method that can accurately
describe both weakly and strongly correlated finite many-fermion systems.

robots in the real world. In the context of variable impedance actuators
(VIAs), one of the main focuses has been on improving energy efficiency through
reduction of energy consumption. However, the harvesting of dissipated energy
in such systems remains under-explored. This study proposes a novel variable
damping module design enabling energy regeneration in VIAs by exploiting the
regenerative braking effect of DC motors. The proposed damping module uses four
switches to combine regenerative and dynamic braking, in a hybrid approach that
enables energy regeneration without a reduction in the range of damping
achievable. A physical implementation on a simple VIA mechanism is presented in
which the regenerative properties of the proposed module are characterised and
compared against theoretical predictions. To investigate the role of variable
regenerative damping in terms of energy efficiency of longterm operation,
experiments are reported in which the VIA equipped with the proposed damping
module performs sequential reaching to a series of stochastic targets. The
results indicate that the combination of variable stiffness and variable
regenerative damping is preferable to achieve the optimal trade-off between
task performance and energy efficiency. Use of the latter results in a 25%
performance improvement on overall performance metrics (incorporating reaching
accuracy, settling time, energy consumption and regeneration), over comparable
schemes where either stiffness or damping are fixed.

information arriving at different times, the accumulated information of earlier
evidence affects the process of information accumulation of later evidence. It
was shown that the rate of information extraction depends on whether the pulse
is the first or the second one. The proposed model can also explain the
stronger effect of the second pulse as shown by Kiani et al. 2013.

dynamo and how it causes activity signatures such as dark spots and bright
faculae. We study the appearance of activity signatures in contemporaneous
photometric and chromospheric time series. Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used
to search for cycle periods present in both time series. To emphasize the
signature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both
data sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing
season. After subtracting the rotational variability, cycle amplitudes and the
phase difference between the two time series are obtained by fitting both time
series simultaneously using the same cycle period. We find cycle periods in 27
of the 30 stars in our sample. The phase difference between the two time series
reveals that the variability in fast rotating active stars is usually in
anti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in
phase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the
active stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active
stars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less active stars are dominated by
bright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination at the
Vaughan-Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one. We conclude that
faculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages >2.55
Gyr. The data further suggest that the Vaughan-Preston gap can not explain the
previously detected dearth of Kepler rotation periods between 15-25 days.
Nevertheless, our results led us to propose an explanation for the rotation
period dearth to be due to the non-detection of periodicity caused by the
cancellation of dark spots and bright faculae at 800 Myr.

for spintronic technologies. Spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnetic tunnel
contacts is well-described using linear (spin-)transport equations, provided
that there is no applied bias, as in nonlocal spin detection. It is shown here
that in a biased ferromagnetic tunnel contact, spin detection is strongly
nonlinear. As a result, the spin-detection efficiency is not equal to the
tunnel spin polarization. In silicon-based 4-terminal spin-transport devices,
even a small bias (tens of mV) across the Fe/MgO detector contact enhances the
spin-detection efficiency to values up to 140 \% (spin extraction bias) or, for
spin injection bias, reduces it to almost zero, while, parenthetically, the
charge current remains highly spin polarized. Calculations reveal that the
nonlinearity originates from the energy dispersion of the tunnel transmission
and the resulting nonuniform energy distribution of the tunnel current,
offering a route to engineer spin conversion. Taking nonlinear spin detection
into account is also shown to explain a multitude of peculiar and puzzling spin
signals in structures with a biased detector, including two- and three-terminal

efficient non-radiative carrier capture, with capture cross-sections exceeding

(HFL) residing on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D
TI) is addressed at the mean-field level. An expression for the PI condition is
derived in terms of a few microscopic parameters in each angular momentum
channel corresponding to a central interaction between the helical electrons.
It is found that because of the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
the Landau parameter, $\bar{F}_{l}$ corresponding to a particular angular
momentum channel $l$ depends not only on the electron-electron interaction in
the same channel but also interactions in $(l+1)$ and $(l-1)$ channels. The
formalism automatically excludes the $l=1$ PI in the HFL where the Galilean
invariance is broken because of the presence of strong SOC. It is also found
that the competing PIs can only be avoided until the appearance of $l=2$ PI. In
this case, the corresponding nematic instability can even be achieved in the
$l=1$ angular momentum channel of interaction between the electrons. The range
of interaction between the electrons plays a pivotal role in bringing out the
PIs. This is established by analysing a few realistic profiles of the
interaction. Another class of instability, involving a change in the topology
of the Fermi surface without breaking the rotational symmetry, is found which
competes with the PIs. Quantum phase transition originating from this
instability is quite similar to the Lifshitz transition but is driven by
electron-electron interaction. Possible connections of this instability with
experiments are also described briefly.

maximal equilibrium-independent passive (MEIP) dynamics on the nodes, and a
general class of nonlinear coupling functions on the edges. The first
contribution of this work is to generalize the classical notion of signed
networks for graphs with scalar weights to graphs with nonlinear edge functions
using notions from passivity theory. We show that the output of the network can
finally form one or several steady-state clusters if all edges are positive,
and in particular, all nodes can reach an output agreement if there is a
connected subnetwork spanning all nodes and strictly positive edges. When there
are non-positive edges added to the network, we show that the tension of the
network still converges to the equilibria of the edge functions if the relative
outputs of the nodes connected by non-positive edges converge to their
equilibria. Furthermore, we establish the equivalent circuit models for signed
nonlinear networks, and define the concept of equivalent edge functions which
is a generalization of the notion of effective resistance. We finally
characterize the relationship between the convergence property and the
equivalent edge function, when a non-positive edge is added to a strictly
positive network comprised of nonlinear integrators. We show that the
convergence of the network is always guaranteed, if the sum of the equivalent
edge function of the previous network and the new edge function is passive.

the elastic scattering amplitude is investigated in the
Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) formulation of this theory. In the context of
nonrelativistic potential scattering, for the $R^3\otimes S^1$ spatial
geometry, it was shown that the forward scattering amplitude does not satisfy
analyticity properties in some cases for a class of potentials. If the same
result is valid in relativistic quantum field theory then the consequences will
be far reaching. We show that the forward elastic scattering amplitude of the

  Computer Science at Technische Universit\""at Berlin",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP) considers the efficient
allocation of resources distributed in a substrate network to a set of request
networks. Many existing works discuss either heuristics or exact algorithms,
resulting in a choice between quick runtimes and quality guarantees for the
solutions. Recently, the first fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) approximation
algorithm for the VNEP with arbitrary request and substrate topologies has been
published by Rost and Schmid. This algorithm is based on a LP formulation and
is FPT in the newly introduced graph parameter extraction width (EW). It
therefore combines positive traits of heuristics and exact approaches: The
runtime is polynomial for instances with bounded EW, and the algorithm returns
approximate solutions with high probability.
  We propose two extensions of this algorithm to optimize its runtime. Firstly,
we develop a new LP formulation related to tree decompositions. We show that
this LP formulation is always smaller, and that the resulting algorithm is FPT
in the new parameter extraction label width (ELW). We improve on two important
results by Rost and Schmid: For centrally rooted half-wheel topologies, the EW
scales linearly with request size, whereas the ELW is constant. Further, adding
any number of paths parallel to an existing edge increases the EW by at most
the maximum degree of the request. By contrast, the ELW only increases by at
most one. Lastly, we show that finding the minimal ELW is NP-hard.
  Secondly, we consider the approach of partitioning the request into subgraphs
which are processed independently, yielding even smaller LP formulations. While
this algorithm may lead to higher ELW within the subgraphs, we show that this
increase is always smaller than the size of the inter-subgraph boundary. In
particular, the algorithm has zero additional cost when subgraphs are separated
by a single node.

for human visual system. Many image textures, especially the small-scale or
stochastic textures are rich in high-frequency variations, and are difficult to
be preserved. Current state-of-the-art denoising algorithms typically adopt a
nonlocal approach consisting of image patch grouping and group-wise denoising
filtering. To achieve a better image denoising while preserving the variations
in texture, we first adaptively group high correlated image patches with the
same kinds of texture elements (texels) via an adaptive clustering method. This
adaptive clustering method is applied in an
over-clustering-and-iterative-merging approach, where its noise robustness is
improved with a custom merging threshold relating to the noise level and
cluster size. For texture-preserving denoising of each cluster, considering
that the variations in texture are captured and wrapped in not only the
between-dimension energy variations but also the within-dimension variations of
PCA transform coefficients, we further propose a PCA-transform-domain variation
adaptive filtering method to preserve the local variations in textures.
Experiments on natural images show the superiority of the proposed
transform-domain variation adaptive filtering to traditional PCA-based hard or
soft threshold filtering. As a whole, the proposed denoising method achieves a
favorable texture preserving performance both quantitatively and visually,
especially for stochastic textures, which is further verified in camera raw
image denoising.

about millions and sometimes billions of extra-galactic objects. Since the very
large number of objects makes manual observation impractical, automatic methods
that can analyze and annotate extra-galactic objects are required to fully
utilize the discovery power of these databases. Machine learning methods for
annotation of celestial objects can be separated broadly into methods that use
the photometric information collected by digital sky surveys, and methods that
analyze the image of the object. Here we describe a hybrid method that combines
photometry and image data to annotate galaxies by their morphology, and a
method that uses that information to identify objects that are visually similar
to a query object (query-by-example). The results are compared to using just
photometric information from SDSS, and to using just the morphological
descriptors extracted directly from the images. The comparison shows that for
automatic classification the image data provide marginal addition to the
information provided by the photometry data. For query-by-example, however, the
analysis of the image data provides more information that improves the
automatic detection substantially. The source code and binaries of the method

a setting in which $n$ problem instances, all equally important, must be solved
concurrently. The system involves scheduling executions of contract algorithms
(which offer a trade-off between allowable computation time and quality of the
solution) in m identical parallel processors. When an interruption occurs, the
system must report a solution to each of the $n$ problem instances. The quality
of this output is then compared to the best-possible algorithm that has
foreknowledge of the interruption time and must, likewise, produce solutions to
all $n$ problem instances. This extends the well-studied setting in which only
one problem instance is queried at interruption time.
  In this work we first introduce new measures for evaluating the performance
of interruptible systems in this setting. In particular, we propose the
deficiency of a schedule as a performance measure that meets the requirements
of the problem at hand. We then present a schedule whose performance we prove
that is within a small factor from optimal in the general, multiprocessor
setting. We also show several lower bounds on the deficiency of schedules on a
single processor. More precisely, we prove a general lower bound of (n+1)/n, an
improved lower bound for the two-problem setting (n=2), and a tight lower bound
for the class of round-robin schedules. Our techniques can also yield a
simpler, alternative proof of the main result of [Bernstein et al, IJCAI 2003]

we report here extensive numerical analyses of several one-dimensional KPZ
models on substrates whose size enlarges as $\langle L(t) \rangle = L_0+\omega

[$\langle h \rangle\sim t$]. We show that the competition between the $L$

role in the asymptotic statistics of the interfaces. While systems with
$\gamma>1/z$ have HDs given by GUE and the interface width increasing as $w
\sim t^{\beta}$, for $\gamma<1/z$ the HDs are Gaussian, in a correlated regime
where $w \sim t^{\alpha \gamma}$. For the special case $\gamma=1/z$, a
continuous class of distributions exists, which interpolate between Gaussian
(for small $\omega/c$) and GUE (for $\omega/c \gg 1$). Interestingly, the HD
seems to agree with the Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) TW distribution for
$\omega/c \approx 10$. Despite the GUE HDs for $\gamma>1/z$, the spatial
covariances present a strong dependence on the parameters $\omega$ and
$\gamma$, agreeing with Airy$_2$ only for $\omega \gg 1$, for a given $\gamma$,

surprising given that the two-body problem has only one bound state coupled to
a continuum. They arise due to interference between multiply occupied bound

compared to the Fermi polaron where the bound state can be occupied only once.
We derive an implicit equation for the frequency of these oscillations and show
that it can be approximated by the energy of the two-body bound state. Finally,

extended to multimonoidal monads in symmetric strict monoidal 2-categories.
Namely, any symmetric strict monoidal 2-category $\mathcal M$ admits a
symmetric strict monoidal 2-category of pseudomonoids, monoidal 1-cells and
monoidal 2-cells in $\mathcal M$. Dually, there is a symmetric strict monoidal
2-category of pseudomonoids, opmonoidal 1-cells and opmonoidal 2-cells in
$\mathcal M$. Extending a construction due to Aguiar and Mahajan for $\mathcal
M=\mathsf{Cat}$, we may apply the first construction $p$-times and the second
one $q$-times (in any order). It yields a 2-category $\mathcal M_{pq}$. A
0-cell therein is an object $A$ of $\mathcal M$ together with $p+q$ compatible
pseudomonoid structures; it is termed a $(p+q)$-oidal object in $\mathcal M$. A
monad in $\mathcal M_{pq}$ is called a $(p,q)$-oidal monad in $\mathcal M$; it
is a monad $t$ on $A$ in $\mathcal M$ together with $p$ monoidal, and $q$
opmonoidal structures in a compatible way. If $\mathcal M$ has monoidal
Eilenberg-Moore construction, and certain (Linton type) stable coequalizers
exist, then a $(p+q)$-oidal structure on the Eilenberg-Moore object $A^t$ of a
$(p,q)$-oidal monad $(A,t)$ is shown to arise via a symmetric strict monoidal
double functor to Ehresmann's double category $\mathbb S\mathsf{qr} (\mathcal
M)$ of squares in $\mathcal M$, from the double category of monads in $\mathbb
S\mathsf{qr} (\mathcal M)$ in the sense of Fiore, Gambino and Kock. While $q$
ones of the pseudomonoid structures of $A^t$ are lifted along the `forgetful'
1-cell $A^t \to A$, the other $p$ ones are lifted along its left adjoint. In
the particular example when $\mathcal M$ is an appropriate 2-subcategory of
$\mathsf{Cat}$, this yields a conceptually different proof of some recent
results due to Aguiar, Haim and L\'opez Franco.

$\varepsilon(n)>0$.
  It is expected that, for $n \leq 2$, the model exhibits a phase transition in
terms of~$x$, that separates regimes of polynomial and exponential decay of
loop sizes. In this paradigm, our result implies that the phase transition for
$n \in (1,2]$ occurs at some critical parameter $x_c(n)$ strictly greater than
that $x_c(1) = 1/\sqrt3$. The value of the latter is known since the loop
$O(1)$ model on the hexagonal lattice represents the contours of the
spin-clusters of the Ising model on the triangular lattice.
  The proof is based on developing $n$ as $1+(n-1)$ and exploiting the fact
that, when $x<\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, the Ising model exhibits exponential decay
on any (possibly non simply-connected) domain. The latter follows from the
positive association of the FK-Ising representation.

methods such as query expansion, relevance feedback, document clustering, and
multi-modal fusion. Especially, correlation and independence are important
issues when fusing different modalities that influence a multi-modal
information retrieval process. The basic idea of correlation is that an
observable can help predict or enhance another observable. In quantum
mechanics, quantum correlation, called entanglement, is a sort of correlation
between the observables measured in atomic-size particles when these particles
are not necessarily collected in ensembles. In this paper, we examine a
multimodal fusion scenario that might be similar to that encountered in physics
by firstly measuring two observables (i.e., text-based relevance and
image-based relevance) of a multi-modal document without counting on an
ensemble of multi-modal documents already labeled in terms of these two
variables. Then, we investigate the existence of non-classical correlations
between pairs of multi-modal documents. Despite there are some basic
differences between entanglement and classical correlation encountered in the
macroscopic world, we investigate the existence of this kind of non-classical
correlation through the Bell inequality violation. Here, we experimentally test
several novel association methods in a small-scale experiment. However, in the
current experiment we did not find any violation of the Bell inequality.
Finally, we present a series of interesting discussions, which may provide
theoretical and empirical insights and inspirations for future development of
this direction.

  This paper presents the design, analysis, and implementation of FiBA, a novel
sliding-window aggregation algorithm with an amortized upper bound of $O(\log
d)$ time per insert or evict, where $d$ is the distance of the inserted or
evicted value to the closer end of the window. This means $O(1)$ time for
in-order arrivals and nearly $O(1)$ time for slightly out-of-order arrivals,
with a smooth transition towards $O(\log n)$ as $d$ approaches $n$. We also
prove a matching lower bound on running time, showing optimality. Our algorithm
is as general as the prior state-of-the-art: it requires associativity, but not
invertibility nor commutativity. At the heart of the algorithm is a careful
combination of finger-searching techniques, lazy rebalancing, and
position-aware partial aggregates. We further show how to answer range queries
that aggregate subwindows for window sharing. Finally, our experimental
evaluation shows that FiBA performs well in practice and supports the
theoretical findings.

assess the performance of variational models for fusing raw DEMs produced from

The results illustrate the high efficiency of variational models for TanDEM-X

product of marginal distributions. The distance covariance is $0$ if and only
if two random vectors ${X}$ and ${Y}$ are independent. This measure has the
power to detect the presence of a dependence structure when the sample size is
large enough. They further showed that the sample distance covariance can be

$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ cost. The quadratic computing time greatly limits the
application of distance covariance to large data. In this paper, we present a

Finite-element method (LSFEM) to approach data-assimilation problems for the
steady-state, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Our LSFEM discretization
is based on a stress-velocity-pressure (S-V-P) first-order formulation, using
discrete counterparts of the Sobolev spaces $H({\rm div}) \times H^1 \times
L^2$ respectively. Resolution of the system is via minimization of a
least-squares functional representing the magnitude of the residual of the
equations. A simple and immediate approach to extend this solver to
data-assimilation is to add a data-discrepancy term to the functional. Whereas
most data-assimilation techniques require a large number of evaluations of the
forward-simulations and are therefore very expensive, the approach proposed in
this work uniquely has the same cost as a single forward run. However, the
question arises: what is the statistical model implied by this choice? We
answer this within the Bayesian framework, establishing the latent background
covariance model and the likelihood. Further we demonstrate that - in the
linear case - the method is equivalent to application of the Kalman filter, and
derive the posterior covariance. We practically demonstrate the capabilities of
our method on a backward-facing step case. Our LSFEM formulation (without data)
is shown to have good approximation quality, even on relatively coarse meshes -
in particular with respect to mass-conservation and reattachment location.
Adding limited velocity measurements from experiment, we show that the method
is able to correct for discretization error on very coarse meshes, as well as
correct for the influence of unknown and uncertain boundary-conditions.

three-dimensional space, is ideally suited for quantum control. Molecular
angular momentum is naturally quantized, time evolution is governed by a
well-known Hamiltonian with only a few accurately known parameters, and
transitions between rotational levels can be driven by external fields from
various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Control over the rotational
motion can be exerted in one-, two- and many-body scenarios, thereby allowing
to probe Anderson localization, target stereoselectivity of bimolecular
reactions, or encode quantum information, to name just a few examples. The
corresponding approaches to quantum control are pursued within separate, and
typically disjoint, subfields of physics, including ultrafast science, cold
collisions, ultracold gases, quantum information science, and condensed matter
physics. It is the purpose of this review to present the various control
phenomena, which all rely on the same underlying physics, within a unified
framework. To this end, we recall the Hamiltonian for free rotations, assuming
the rigid rotor approximation to be valid, and summarize the different ways for
a rotor to interact with external electromagnetic fields. These interactions
can be exploited for control --- from achieving alignment, orientation, or
laser cooling in a one-body framework, steering bimolecular collisions, or
realizing a quantum computer or quantum simulator in the many-body setting.

Importantly, the behavior of the system is robust against deviations from the

most luminous multi-wavelength sources; decades after their discovery their
physics and energetics are still poorly understood. The past decade has seen a
dramatic improvement in the quality of available data, but despite this
improvement the semi-analytical modelling of jets has advanced slowly: simple
one-zone models are still the most commonly employed method of interpreting
data, in particular for AGN jets. These models can roughly constrain the
properties of jets but they cannot unambiguously couple their emission to the
launching regions and internal dynamics, which can be probed with simulations.
However, simulations are not easily comparable to observations because they
cannot yet self-consistently predict spectra. We present an advanced
semi-analytical model which accounts for the dynamics of the whole jet,
starting from a simplified parametrization of Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics
in which the magnetic flux is converted into bulk kinetic energy. To benchmark
the model we fit six quasisimultaneous, multi-wavelength spectral energy
distributions of the BL Lac PKS 2155-304 obtained by the TANAMI program, and we
address the degeneracies inherent to such a complex model by employing a
state-of-the-art exploration of parameter space, which so far has been mostly
neglected in the study of AGN jets. We find that this new approach is much more
effective than a single-epoch fit in providing meaningful constraints on model

maximum likelihood estimation, but it is generally only guaranteed to find its
stationary points of the log-likelihood objective. The goal of this article is
to present theoretical and empirical evidence that over-parameterization can
help EM avoid spurious local optima in the log-likelihood. We consider the
problem of estimating the mean vectors of a Gaussian mixture model in a
scenario where the mixing weights are known. Our study shows that the global
behavior of EM, when one uses an over-parameterized model in which the mixing
weights are treated as unknown, is better than that when one uses the (correct)
model with the mixing weights fixed to the known values. For symmetric
Gaussians mixtures with two components, we prove that introducing the
(statistically redundant) weight parameters enables EM to find the global
maximizer of the log-likelihood starting from almost any initial mean
parameters, whereas EM without this over-parameterization may very often fail.
For other Gaussian mixtures, we provide empirical evidence that shows similar
behavior. Our results corroborate the value of over-parameterization in solving
non-convex optimization problems, previously observed in other domains.

called the logotropic model. The logotropic model is able to account, without
free parameter, for the constant surface density of the dark matter halos, for
their mass-radius relation, and for the Tully-Fisher relation. In this paper,
we explore other consequences of this model. By advocating a form of ""strong
cosmic coincidence"" we predict that the present proportion of dark energy in
the Universe is $\Omega_{\rm de,0}=e/(1+e)\simeq 0.731$ which is close to the
observed value. We also remark that the surface density of dark matter halos
and the surface density of the Universe are of the same order as the surface
density of the electron. This makes a curious connection between cosmological
and atomic scales. Using these coincidences, we can relate the Hubble constant,
the electron mass and the electron charge to the cosmological constant. We also
suggest that the famous numbers $137$ (fine-structure constant) and $123$
(logotropic constant) may actually represent the same thing. This could unify
microphysics and cosmophysics. We study the thermodynamics of the logotropic
model and find a connection to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes if
we assume that the logotropic fluid is made of particles of mass
$m_{\Lambda}\sim \hbar\sqrt{\Lambda}/c^2=2.08\times 10^{-33}\, {\rm eV/c^2}$
(cosmons). In that case, the universality of the surface density of the dark
matter halos may be related to a form of holographic principle (the fact that
their entropy scales like their area). We use similar arguments to explain why
the surface density of the electron and the surface density of the Universe are
of the same order and justify the empirical Weinberg relation.

Moreover, CLMFO shows the smallest Tc down to 70 K. Ferromagnetic-like behavior

  sign-regular for some order with applications to totally positive
  discrete-time systems",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A matrix is called strictly sign-regular of order $k$ (denoted by $SSR_k$) if
all its $k\times k$ minors are non-zero and have the same sign. For example,
totally positive matrices, i.e., matrices with all minors positive, are $SSR_k$
for all $k$. Another important subclass are those that are $SSR_k$ for all odd
$k$. Such matrices have interesting sign variation diminishing properties, and
it has been recently shown that they play an important role in the analysis of
certain nonlinear cooperative dynamical systems.
  In this paper, the spectral properties of nonsingular matrices that are
$SSR_k$ for a specific value $k$ are studied. One of the results is that the
product of the first $k$ eigenvalues is real and of the same sign as the
$k\times k$ minors, and that linear combinations of certain eigenvectors have
specific sign patterns. It is then shown how known results for matrices that
are $SSR_k$ for several values of $k$ can be derived from these spectral
properties.
  Using these theoretical results, the notion of a totally positive
discrete-time system (TPDTS) is introduced. This may be regarded as the
discrete-time analogue of the important notion of a totally positive
differential system, introduced by Schwarz in 1970. The asymptotic behavior of
time-invariant and time-varying TPDTSs is analyzed, and it is shown that every
trajectory of a periodic time-varying TPDTS converges to a periodic solution.

signal of interest steering vector is considered in the paper. In this case,
the optimal beamformer is obtained by computing the sample matrix inverse and
an optimal estimate of the signal of interest steering vector. The common
criteria to find the best estimate of the steering vector are the beamformer
output SINR and output power, while the constraints assume as little as
possible prior inaccurate knowledge about the signal of interest, the
propagation media, and the antenna array. Herein, a new beamformer output power
maximization problem is formulated and solved subject to a double-sided norm
perturbation constraint, a similarity constraint, and a quadratic constraint
that guarantees that the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the signal of interest
is away from the DOA region of all linear combinations of the interference
steering vectors. In the new robust design, the prior information required
consists of some allowable error norm bounds, the approximate knowledge of the
antenna array geometry, and the angular sector of the signal of interest. It
turns out that the array output power maximization problem is a non-convex QCQP
problem with inhomogeneous constraints. However, we show that the problem is
still solvable, and develop efficient algorithms for finding globally optimal
estimate of the signal of interest steering vector. The results are generalized
to the case where an ellipsoidal constraint is considered, and sufficient
conditions for the global optimality are derived. In addition, a new quadratic
constraint on the actual signal steering vector is proposed in order to improve
the array performance. To validate our results, simulation examples are
presented, and they demonstrate the improved performance of the new robust
beamformers in terms of the output SINR as well as the output power.

  Time-of-Flight Recording",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We established a new approach to hard-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(HAXPES). The instrumental key feature is an increase of the dimensionality of
the recording scheme from 2D to 3D. A high-energy momentum microscope can
detect electrons with initial kinetic energies more than 6 keV with high
angular resolution < 0.1{\deg}. The large k-space acceptance of the special
objective lens allows for simultaneous full-field imaging of many Brillouin
zones. Combined with time-of-flight parallel energy recording, this method
yields maximum parallelization of data acquisition. In a pilot experiment at
the new beamline P22 at PETRA III, Hamburg, count rates of more than $10^{6}$
counts per second in the d-band complex of transition metals established an
unprecedented HAXPES recording speed. It was found that the concept of
tomographic k-space mapping previously demonstrated in the soft X-ray regime
works equally well in the hard X-ray range. Sharp valence band k-patterns of Re
collected at an excitation energy of 6 keV correspond to direct transitions to
the 28th repeated Brillouin zone. Given the high X-ray brilliance
(1.1x$10^{13}$ hv/s in a spot of less than 20x15 $mu^{2}$), the 3D bulk
Brillouin zone can be mapped in a few hours. X-ray photoelectron diffraction
(XPD) patterns with < 0.1{\deg} resolution are recorded within minutes.
Previously unobserved fine details in the diffractograms reflect the large
number of scatterers, several $10^{4}$ to $10^{6}$, depending on energy. The
short photoelectron wavelength (an order of magnitude smaller than the
interatomic distance) amplifies phase differences and makes hard X-ray XPD with
high resolution a very sensitive structural tool. The high count rates pave the
way towards spin-resolved HAXPES using an imaging spin filter.

Our neural architecture is composed of a critic and an actor network. Both

representation is also optimized to estimate the state value. Separately, an
ensemble of predictive world models generates, based on its learning progress,
an intrinsic reward signal which is combined with the extrinsic reward to guide
the exploration of the actor-critic learner. Our approach is more
data-efficient and inherently more stable than the existing actor-critic
methods for continuous control from pixel data. We evaluate our algorithm for
the task of learning robotic reaching and grasping skills on a realistic

simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity
adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous
work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven
by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors
originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive
input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback.
Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our
model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron.
We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and
classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error
backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent
observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical
microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic

economics and other disciplines. As Gaussian approximations perform poorly in
the presence of ""small denominators,"" trimming is routinely employed as a
regularization strategy. However, ad hoc trimming of the observations renders
usual inference procedures invalid for the target estimand, even in large
samples. In this paper, we first show that the IPW estimator can have different
(Gaussian or non-Gaussian) asymptotic distributions, depending on how ""close to
zero"" the probability weights are and on how large the trimming threshold is.
As a remedy, we propose an inference procedure that is robust not only to small
probability weights entering the IPW estimator but also to a wide range of
trimming threshold choices, by adapting to these different asymptotic
distributions. This robustness is achieved by employing resampling techniques
and by correcting a non-negligible trimming bias. We also propose an
easy-to-implement method for choosing the trimming threshold by minimizing an
empirical analogue of the asymptotic mean squared error. In addition, we show
that our inference procedure remains valid with the use of a data-driven
trimming threshold. We illustrate our method by revisiting a dataset from the

detect spirals in both gas and dust in strongly self-gravitating discs (i.e.
discs with up to two spiral arms and strong kinematic perturbations). Detecting
spirals will be possible in discs of arbitrary inclination, either by directly
spatially resolving them for more face-on discs (inclinations up to ~50

Carlo gas tracer particles to tracer particles for the stars and black holes,
so that they can exchange mass back and forth between themselves. With such a
scheme, we can follow the full cycle of baryons, that is, from gas-forming
stars to the release of mass back to the surrounding gas multiple times, or
accretion of gas onto black holes. The overall impact on computation time is
$\sim$ 3% per tracer per initial cell. As a proof of concept, we study an

variably-spaced energy bins. Thermodynamic properties of the new coarse-grained
model closely match those of the full set of rovibrational levels over a wide
temperature range, using a number of bins much smaller than the complete
mechanism. The chemical-kinetic behavior of the original equally -- and new
variably -- spaced bin formulations is compared by simulating excitation and
dissociation of N2 in an adiabatic, isochoric reactor. The variably-spaced

our Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) implementation for the coarse-grain

our state-resolved reaction mechanism. The DSMC code is then verified against
equivalent master equation (ME) calculations. In these simulations,
state-resolved cross sections are used in analytical form. They verify
micro-reversibility for the bins and allow for faster execution of the code. In
our verification, we obtain very close agreement for the N and N2
concentrations, as well as the translational and rovibrational mode
temperatures obtained independently using both methods. In addition to
macroscopic moments, we compare internal energy populations predicted at
selected time steps via DSMC and ME. We observe good agreement between both
methods within the statistical scatter limits imposed by DSMC. In future work,
the rovibrational coarse-grain model coupled to the particle method will allow

most common question which is generally asked is: How does an airplane gain
lift? And the most common answer is via the Bernoulli principle. It turns out
that it is wrongly applied in common explanations, and there are certain
misconceptions. In an alternative explanation the push of air from below the
wing is argued to be the lift generating force via Newton's law. There are
problems with this explanation too. In this paper we try to clear these
misconceptions, and the correct explanation, using the Lancaster-Prandtl
circulation theory, is discussed. We argue that even the Lancaster-Prandtl
theory at the zero angle of attack needs further insights. To this end, we put
forward a theory which is applicable at zero angle of attack. A new length
scale perpendicular to the lower surface of the wing is introduced and it turns
out that the ratio of this length scale to the cord length of a wing is roughly
$0.4930\pm0.09498$ for typical NACA airfoils that we analyzed. This invariance
points to something fundamental. The idea of our theory is simple. The
""squeezing"" effect of the flow above the wing due to camber leads to an
effective Venturi tube formation and leads to higher velocity over the upper
surface of the wing and thereby reducing pressure according the Bernoulli
theorem and generating lift. Thus at zero angle of attack there is no need to
invoke vortex and anti-vortex pair generation. In fact vortex and anti-vortex
pair generation cannot be justified. We come up with the equation for the lift
coefficient at zero angle of attack: \[C_l = \frac{1}{c}\int_0^c dx
\left(\frac{h_c^2}{(h_c - f(x))^2}-1\right).\] Here $C_l$ is the lift
coefficient, $h_c$ is our new length scale perpendicular to the lower surface
of the wing and $f(x)$ is the functional profile of the upper surface of the
wing.

Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt version of Bell's inequality (CHSH inequality) and
therefore indicate the presence of quantum entanglement in their structure. We
obtain this result by considering two concepts and their combination and
coincidence operations consisting of searches of co-occurrences of exemplars of
these concepts in specific corpuses of documents. Measuring the frequencies of
these co-occurrences and calculating the relative frequencies as approximate
probabilities entering in the CHSH inequality, we obtain manifest violations of
the latter for all considered corpuses of documents. In comparing these
violations with those analogously obtained in an earlier work for the same
combined concepts in psychological coincidence experiments with human
participants, also violating the CHSH inequality, we identify the entanglement
as being carried by the meaning connection between the two considered concepts
within the combination they form. We explain the stronger violation for the
corpuses of documents, as compared to the violation in the psychology
experiments, as being due to the superior meaning domain of the human mind and,
on the other side, to the latter reaching a broader domain of meaning and being
possibly also actively influenced during the experimentation. We mention some
of the issues to be analyzed in future work such as the violations of the CHSH

on-calls. An on-call scheduling policy is proposed to best balance between
demand coverage and labor cost under legal constraints of working time. The
problem is modelled as a two-stage stochastic Integer Linear Program (ILP) and
solved using a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. Several epidemic
scenarios are defined with data from an ED in Lille, France.

workshops at international conferences began in 2007 and has grown to include
over 150 challenges. Several of these challenges have had a major impact in the
field. However, whereas well-designed challenges have the potential to unite
and focus the field on creating solutions to important problems, poorly
designed and documented challenges can equally impede a field and lead to
pursuing incremental improvements in metric scores with no theoretic or
clinical significance. This is supported by a critical assessment of challenges
at the international MICCAI conference. In this assessment the main observation
was that small changes to the underlying challenge data can drastically change
the ranking order on the leaderboard. Related to this is the practice of
leaderboard climbing, which is characterized by participants focusing on
incrementally improving metric results rather than advancing science or solving
the driving problem of a challenge. In this abstract we look beyond the
leaderboard of a challenge and instead look at the conclusions that can be
drawn from a challenge with respect to the research problem that it is
addressing. Research study design is well described in other research areas and
can be translated to challenge design when viewing challenges as research
studies on algorithm performance that address a research problem. Based on the
two main types of scientific research study design, we propose two main
challenge types, which we think would benefit other research areas as well: 1)
an insight challenge that is based on a qualitative study design and 2) a
deployment challenge that is based on a quantitative study design. In addition
we briefly touch upon related considerations with respect to statistical
significance versus practical significance, generalizability and data
saturation.

readability of the current developments about cyber-physical production systems
(CPPS). Indeed, the large scientific area of CPPS makes it difficult to
identify clearly and rapidly, in the various applications that were made of
CPPS, what are the choices, best practices and methodology that are suggested
and that could be used for a new application. This work intends to introduce an
analysis framework able to classify those developments. An extensive study of
literature enabled to extract the major criteria that are to be used in the
framework, namely: Development Extent; Research Axis; Instrumenting;
Communication standards; Intelligence deposit; Cognition level; Human factor.
Several recent examples of CPPS developments in literature are used to
illustrate the use of the framework and brief conclusions are drawn from the

Several hundreds of CubeSats have already been successfully launched in the
past few years and the number of announced launches grows every year. These
platforms provide an easy access to space for universities and organizations
which otherwise could not afford it. However, these spacecraft still rely on RF
communications, where the spectrum is already crowded and cannot support the
growing demand for data transmission to the ground. Lasercom holds the promise
to be the solution to this problem, with a potential improvement of several
orders of magnitude in the transmission capacity, while keeping a low size,
weight and power. Between 2016 and 2017, The Keck Institute for Space Studies
(KISS), a joint institute of the California Institute of Technology and the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, brought together a group of space scientists and
lasercom engineers to address the current challenges that this technology
faces, in order to enable it to compete with RF and eventually replace it when
high-data rate is needed. After two one-week workshops, the working group
started developing a report addressing three study cases: low Earth orbit,
crosslinks and deep space. This paper presents the main points and conclusions
of these KISS workshops.

competition. Based on the above problems, this paper analyzes the rules of the
FINA's 10-meter platform diving difficulty coefficient, establishes the
multi-rigid-body model of the human body, obtains the relationship between the
moment of inertia and the completion time of the athletes to complete each
diving action and the athlete's body shape, and determines the index to measure
the athlete's body shape. The Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial is used to
establish the functional relationship between the body shape correction
coefficient and the body shape correction index, and the body shape correction
coefficient corresponding to different body type athletes is determined
accordingly. Finally, a new 10-meter platform diving difficulty coefficient
scheme was developed.

solving full-waveform inversion are not only computationally expensive, but
also yields low-resolution results because of the ill-posedness and cycle

machine-learning techniques to solve the full-waveform inversion. Specifically,
we focus on applying the convolutional neural network~(CNN) to directly derive
the inversion operator $f^{-1}$ so that the velocity structure can be obtained
without knowing the forward operator $f$. We build a convolutional neural
network with an encoder-decoder structure to model the correspondence from
seismic data to subsurface velocity structures. Furthermore, we employ the
conditional random field~(CRF) on top of the CNN to generate structural
predictions by modeling the interactions between different locations on the
velocity model. Our numerical examples using synthetic seismic reflection data
show that the propose CNN-CRF model significantly improve the accuracy of the
velocity inversion while the computational time is reduced.

herein proposed. The asymptotic expansion of the micro-displacement field in
the transformed Laplace domain allows obtaining, from the expression of the
micro-scale field equations, a set of recursive differential problems defined
over the periodic unit cell. Consequently, the cell problems are derived in
terms of perturbation functions depending on the geometrical and
physical-mechanical properties of the material and its microstructural
heterogeneities. A down-scaling relation is formulated in a consistent form,
which correlates the microscopic to the macroscopic transformed displacement
field and its gradients through the perturbation functions. Average field
equations of infinite order are determined by substituting the down-scale
relation into the micro-field equation. Based on a variational approach, the
macroscopic field equations of a non-local continuum is delivered and the local

continuum are determined. The problem of wave propagation in case of a bi-phase
layered material with orthotropic phases and axis of orthotropy parallel to the
direction of layers is investigated as an example. In such a case, the local
