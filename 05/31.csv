one-staged refrigeration cycle model described in the PID2018 Benchmark
Challenge is presented, and its effectiveness is evaluated. The control system
consists of two components: 1) a preset PID component and 2) a learning
feedforward component which is a function approximator that is adapted on the
basis of the feedback signal. A B-spline network based LFFC and a low-pass
filter based LFFC are designed to track the desired outlet temperature of
evaporator secondary flux and the superheating degree of refrigerant at
evaporator outlet. Encouraging simulation results are included. Qualitative and
quantitative comparison results evaluations show that, with little effort, a
high-performance control system can be obtained with this approach. Our initial
simple attempt of low-pass filter based LFFC and B-spline network based LFFC
give J=0.4902 and J=0.6536 relative to the decentralized PID controller,
respectively. Besides, the initial attempt of a combination controller of our
optimized PI controller and low-pass filter LFFC gives J=0.6947 relative to the

training and test images have similar visual appearance. Therefore, any
seasonal, illumination and environmental changes typically lead to severe
degradation in performance. To cope with this problem, recent works have
proposed to adopt domain adaptation techniques. While effective, these methods
assume that some prior information about the scenario where the robot will
operate is available at training time. Unfortunately, in many cases this
assumption does not hold, as we often do not know where a robot will be
deployed. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present an approach which
aims at learning classification models able to generalize to unseen scenarios.
Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for domain
generalization. Our method develops from the intuition that, given a set of
different classification models associated to known domains (e.g. corresponding
to multiple environments, robots), the best model for a new sample in the novel
domain can be computed directly at test time by optimally combining the known
models. To implement our idea, we exploit recent advances in deep domain
adaptation and design a Convolutional Neural Network architecture with novel
layers performing a weighted version of Batch Normalization. Our experiments,
conducted on three common datasets for robot place categorization, confirm the
validity of our contribution.

Hall effect (SHE), the design of strong SHE materials has become a focus in the
field of spintronics. Because of the recent experimental progress also the spin
Nernst effect (SNE), the thermoelectrical counterpart of the SHE, has attracted
much interest. Empirically strong SHEs and SNEs are associated with $d$-band
compounds, such as transition metals and their alloys -- the largest spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) in a $p$-band material is $\sim 450$
$\left(\hbar/e\right)\left(\Omega\cdot cm\right)^{-1}$ for a Bi-Sb alloy, which
is only about a fifth of platinum. This raises the question whether either the
SHE and SNE are naturally suppressed in $p$-bands compounds, or favourable
$p$-band systems were just not identified yet. Here we consider the $p$-band
semimetal InBi, and predict it has a record SHC $\sigma_{xy}^{z}\approx 1100 \
\left(\hbar/e\right)\left(\Omega\cdot cm\right)^{-1}$ which is due to the
presence of nodal-lines in its band structure. Also the spin-Nernst
conductivity $\alpha_{zx}^y\approx 1.2 \ (\hbar/e)(A/m\cdot K)$ is very large,
but our analysis shows its origin is different as the maximum appears in a
different tensor element. This insight gained on InBi provides guiding
principles to obtain a strong SHE and SNE in $p$-band materials and establishes
a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the SHE and SNE.

  Computation, via Short Cycle Decompositions","80 pages",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a framework for graph sparsification and sketching, based on a new
tool, short cycle decomposition -- a decomposition of an unweighted graph into
an edge-disjoint collection of short cycles, plus few extra edges. A simple
observation gives that every graph G on n vertices with m edges can be
decomposed in $O(mn)$ time into cycles of length at most $2\log n$, and at most
$2n$ extra edges. We give an $m^{1+o(1)}$ time algorithm for constructing a
short cycle decomposition, with cycles of length $n^{o(1)}$, and $n^{1+o(1)}$
extra edges. These decompositions enable us to make progress on several open
questions:
  * We give an algorithm to find $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximations to effective
resistances of all edges in time $m^{1+o(1)}\epsilon^{-1.5}$, improving over
the previous best of $\tilde{O}(\min\{m\epsilon^{-2},n^2 \epsilon^{-1}\})$.
This gives an algorithm to approximate the determinant of a Laplacian up to
$(1\pm\epsilon)$ in $m^{1 + o(1)} + n^{15/8+o(1)}\epsilon^{-7/4}$ time.
  * We show existence and efficient algorithms for constructing graphical
spectral sketches -- a distribution over sparse graphs H such that for a fixed
vector $x$, we have w.h.p. $x'L_Hx=(1\pm\epsilon)x'L_Gx$ and
$x'L_H^+x=(1\pm\epsilon)x'L_G^+x$. This implies the existence of
resistance-sparsifiers with about $n\epsilon^{-1}$ edges that preserve the
effective resistances between every pair of vertices up to $(1\pm\epsilon).$
  * By combining short cycle decompositions with known tools in graph
sparsification, we show the existence of nearly-linear sized degree-preserving
spectral sparsifiers, as well as significantly sparser approximations of
directed graphs. The latter is critical to recent breakthroughs on faster
algorithms for solving linear systems in directed Laplacians.

calculate the sensitivity of model behavior to variations in parameters. In
most cases, models are sloppy, that is, exhibit an exponential hierarchy of
parameter sensitivities. We propose a parameter classification scheme based on
how the sensitivities scale at long observation times. We show that for
oscillatory models, either with a limit cycle or a strange attractor,
sensitivities can become arbitrarily large, which implies a high
effective-dimensionality on the model manifold. Sloppy models with a single
fixed point have model manifolds with low effective-dimensionality, previously
described as a ""hyper-ribbon"". In contrast, models with high effective
dimensionality translate into multimodal fitting problems. We define a measure
of curvature on the model manifold which we call the \emph{winding frequency}
that estimates the linear density of local minima in the model's parameter
space. We then show how alternative choices of fitting metrics can ""unwind"" the
model manifold and give low winding frequencies. This prescription translates
the model manifold from one of high effective-dimensionality into the
""hyper-ribbon"" structures observed elsewhere. This translation opens the door
for applications of sloppy model analysis and model reduction methods developed
for models with low effective-dimensionality.

is found that when an inflection point is formed on the velocity profile in
pressure driven flows, velocity discontinuity occurs at this point. Meanwhile,
pressure pulse is produced at the discontinuity due to conservation of the
total mechanical energy. This discontinuity makes the Navier-Stokes equations
be singular and causes the flow to become indefinite. The analytical results
show that the singularity of the Navier-Stokes equations is the cause of
turbulent transition and the inherent mechanism of sustenance of fully
developed turbulence. Since the velocity is not differentiable at the
singularity, there exist no smooth and physically reasonable solutions of
Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds number (beyond laminar flow). The
negative spike of velocity and the pulse of pressure due to discontinuity have
obtained agreement with experiments and simulations in literature

Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is a unique non-invasive

integrity of the myocardium without the need for exogenous contrast agents.
However, this technique suffers from relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

techniques rely on acquiring and averaging multiple signal acquisitions to
improve the SNR. Moreover, in order to mitigate the influence of respiratory
movement, patients are required to perform many breath holds which results in
prolonged acquisition durations (e.g., ~30 mins using the existing technology).
In this study, we propose a novel cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

to other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed deep cascaded CNN method and
its stochastic variation demonstrated significant improvements. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study using deep CNN based CS for the DT-CMR

  and pN-stage Classification in Breast Cancer","Accepted at MICCAI 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting TNM stage is the major determinant of breast cancer prognosis and
treatment. The essential part of TNM stage classification is whether the cancer
has metastasized to the regional lymph nodes (N-stage). Pathologic N-stage
(pN-stage) is commonly performed by pathologists detecting metastasis in
histological slides. However, this diagnostic procedure is prone to
misinterpretation and would normally require extensive time by pathologists
because of the sheer volume of data that needs a thorough review. Automated
detection of lymph node metastasis and pN-stage prediction has a great
potential to reduce their workload and help the pathologist. Recent advances in
convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown significant improvements in
histological slide analysis, but accuracy is not optimized because of the
difficulty in the handling of gigapixel images. In this paper, we propose a
robust method for metastasis detection and pN-stage classification in breast
cancer from multiple gigapixel pathology images in an effective way. pN-stage
is predicted by combining patch-level CNN based metastasis detector and
slide-level lymph node classifier. The proposed framework achieves a
state-of-the-art quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.9203 on the Camelyon17
dataset, outperforming the previous winning method of the Camelyon17 challenge.

centerpiece to quantify uncertainties arising from the acquisition process. The

signal distribution. Accurate estimation beyond textbook Rician or noncentral
chi distributions often requires information about the acquisition process

usually available. We introduce a new method where a change of variable
naturally gives rise to a particular form of the gamma distribution for

gamma distribution explicitly depend on the number of coils, making it possible
to estimate all unknown parameters using only the magnitude data. A rejection
step is used to make the method automatic and robust to artifacts. Experiments
on synthetic datasets show that the proposed method can reliably estimate both
the degrees of freedom and the standard deviation. The worst case errors range
from below 2% (spatially uniform noise) to approximately 10% (spatially

estimated parameters are stable and have lower variances than compared methods.

the computational complexity, large DNNs are not readily deployable on edge
devices in real-time. To manage complexity and accelerate computation, network
compression techniques based on pruning and quantization have been proposed and
shown to be effective in reducing network size. However, such network
compression can result in irregular matrix structures that are mismatched with
modern hardware-accelerated platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs)
designed to perform the DNN matrix multiplications in a structured
(block-based) way. We propose MPDCompress, a DNN compression algorithm based on
matrix permutation decomposition via random mask generation. In-training
application of the masks molds the synaptic weight connection matrix to a
sub-graph separation format. Aided by the random permutations, a
hardware-desirable block matrix is generated, allowing for a more efficient
implementation and compression of the network. To show versatility, we
empirically verify MPDCompress on several network models, compression rates,

identified in the Kepler field and carried out by teams of the Kepler Follow-Up
Observation Program. Two samples of stars were observed over six years
(2009-2015): 614 standard stars (divided into ""platinum"" and ""gold"" categories)
selected based on their asteroseismic detections and 2667 host stars of Kepler
Objects of Interest (KOIs), most of them planet candidates. Four data analysis
pipelines were used to derive stellar parameters for the observed stars. We
compare the $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log$(g), and [Fe/H] values derived for the
same stars by different pipelines; from the average of the standard deviations
of the differences in these parameter values, we derive error floors of $\sim$
100 K, 0.2 dex, and 0.1 dex for $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log$(g), and [Fe/H],
respectively. Noticeable disagreements are seen mostly at the largest and
smallest parameter values (e.g., in the giant star regime). Most of the
$\log$(g) values derived from spectra for the platinum stars agree on average
within 0.025 dex (but with a spread of 0.1-0.2 dex) with the asteroseismic
$\log$(g) values. Compared to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), the
spectroscopically derived stellar parameters agree within the uncertainties of
the KIC, but are more precise and are thus an important contribution towards
deriving more reliable planetary radii.

management, where the usage of diverse resources must be jointly optimized with
surgical accuracy. A number of key wireless network functionalities (e.g.,

is more, high spatio-temporal traffic variability coupled with the need to
satisfy strict per slice/service SLAs in modern networks, suggest that these
problems must be constantly (re-)solved, to maintain close-to-optimal

Optimization (ONO), which seeks to maintain both agile and efficient control
over time, using an arsenal of data-driven, online learning, and AI-based
techniques. Since the mathematical tools and the studied regimes vary widely
among these methodologies, a theoretical comparison is often out of reach.
Therefore, the important question `what is the right ONO technique?' remains
open to date. In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of each technique and
present a direct quantitative comparison for a specific use case, using real

77 PN candidates selected from Hubble Space Telescope narrow-band imaging,
which are located within the central $\sim$500pc region of M31. Among these

exhibit prominent emission lines, including [O III] $\lambda$5007, [N II]

genuine PNe. We measured the line fluxes, radial velocities and line widths for
all objects, and found that the radial velocities of the circumnuclear PNe
generally trace rotation of the inner bulge. We also estimated a dynamical mass
of $\sim$6.4$\pm$0.5$\times$10$^{9}$$M_{\odot}$ enclosed within an effective
galactocentric radius of 340pc, which is compatible with the previously

previous work we analysed correlators of either purely scalar or purely

for scalar correlators, renormalisation leads to beta functions, novel
conformal anomalies of type B, and unexpected analytic structure in momentum
space; for correlators of stress tensors and/or conserved currents, beta
functions vanish but anomalies of both type B and type A (associated with a
$0/0$ structure) are present. Mixed correlators combine all these features:
beta functions and anomalies of type B, plus the possibility of new type A
anomalies. Following a non-perturbative and general momentum-space analysis, we
present explicit results in dimensions $d=3,4$ for all renormalised 3-point
functions of stress tensors, conserved currents and scalars of dimensions
$\Delta=d$ and $\Delta=d-2$. We identify all anomalies and beta functions, and
explain the form of the anomalous conformal Ward identities. In $d=3$, we find
a $0/0$ structure but the corresponding type A anomaly turns out to be trivial.
In addition, the correlators of two currents and a scalar, and of two stress
tensors and a scalar, both feature universal tensor structures that are
independent of the scalar dimension and vanish for opposite helicities.

usually made, especially for critical predictions of behavior that has not been
experienced. We advocate here a methodology for characterizing models and the
modeling assumptions they represent, using a statistical approach over the full
range of applicability of the models. Such a characterization may then be used
to decide the appropriateness of a model and modeling assumption for use. We
present our method by comparing three different models arising from different
rheology assumptions, and the data show unambiguously the performance of the
models across a wide range of possible flow regimes. This comparison is
facilitated by the recent development of the new release of our TITAN2D mass

probabilistic analysis of contributions from different modeling assumptions in
the models is particularly illustrative of the impact of the assumptions.
Knowledge of which assumptions dominate, and, by how much, is illustrated in
two different case studies: a small scale inclined plane with a flat runway,

consensus-based distributed SGD (i-CDSGD) algorithm, which involves multiple
consensus steps (where each agent communicates information with its neighbors)

(each agent converges to individual model parameters). We analytically
establish convergence of the proposed algorithms for strongly convex and

algorithms for the strongly convex case. We support our algorithms via
numerical experiments, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing

already at the level of early type galaxies, we recently discovered that many
have large CO-traced molecular gas reservoirs consistent with normal star
forming galaxies. These observations raise the question of why these galaxies
have such low star formation rates. Here we present an ALMA search for the
denser gas traced by HCN (1--0) and HCO+ (1--0) in two CO-luminous, quiescent

upper limits are consistent with the low star formation rates and with

to star-forming and even many early type galaxies. This implied low dense gas
mass fraction explains the low star formation rates relative to the CO-traced
molecular gas and suggests the state of the gas in post-starburst galaxies is
unusual, with some mechanism inhibiting its collapse to denser states. We
conclude that post-starbursts galaxies are now quiescent because little dense

volume-complete tracers of the distant disk, bulge, and halo. The chemical
abundances of metal-poor giants also reflect the compositions of the earliest
star-forming regions, providing the initial conditions for the chemical
evolution of the Galaxy. However, the intrinsic rarity of metal-poor giants
combined with the difficulty of efficiently identifying them with broad-band
optical photometry has made it difficult to exploit them for studies of the
Milky Way. We re-derive a giant star photometric selection using existing
public g-band and narrow-band DDO51 photometry obtained in the Kepler field.
Our selection is simple and yields a contamination rate of main-sequence stars
of $\lesssim$1% and a completeness of about 80% for giant stars with $T_{\rm
eff} \lesssim 5250$ K - subject to the selection function of the spectroscopic
surveys used to estimate these rates, and the magnitude range considered
($11\lesssim g\lesssim 15$). While the DDO51 filter is known to be sensitive to
stellar surface gravity, we further show that the mid-infrared colours of
DDO51-selected giants are strongly correlated with spectroscopic metallicity.
This extends the infrared selection developed by Schlaufman & Casey,
demonstrating that the principal contaminants in their selection can be
efficiently removed by the photometric separation of dwarfs and giants. This
implies that any similarly efficient dwarf/giant discriminant (e.g., Gaia) can
be used with WISE colours to select samples of giant stars with high
completeness and low contamination. We employ our photometric selection to
identify three metal-poor giant candidates in the Kepler field with global
asteroseismic parameters and find that masses inferred for these three stars

over-estimated by 20-175%. [abridged]

relic density is determined by the interplay of several annihilation and

controlled by the twin tau annihilation, it can realize the recently discovered

freezes out earlier than the twin tau annihilation. We also provide a method to
calculate the thermal relic density in the intermediate regime where both

luminosities of the AGN in these galaxies. The AGN of M51a is found to be
Compton thick, and both AGN have very low accretion rates ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}

$0.26 \pm 0.03$, consistent with the local AGN obscured fraction at $L_{\rm

theories that the torus, presumed responsible for the obscuration, disappears
at these low accretion luminosities. However, the obscuration may have resulted
from the gas infall driven by the merger rather than the accretion process. We

term ""overmassive brown dwarfs"" form a continuous sequence with traditional
brown dwarfs in any property (mass, effective temperature, radius, luminosity).
To form an overmassive brown dwarf, mass must be added sufficiently slowly to a
sufficiently old traditional brown dwarf below the hydrogen burning limit. We
identify mass transfer in binary brown dwarf systems via Roche lobe overflow
driven by gravitational waves to be the most plausible mechanism to produce the
bulk of the putative overmassive brown dwarf population.

strongly impacts the formation and evolution of the planetary system. The
positive correlation between a host star's iron-content and the presence of an
orbiting giant exoplanet has been confirmed; however, the importance of other
elements in predicting giant planet occurrence is less certain despite their
central role in shaping internal planetary structure. We designed and applied a
machine learning algorithm to the Hypatia Catalog (Hinkel et a. 2014) to
analyze the stellar abundance patterns of known host stars to determine those
elements important in identifying potential giant exoplanet host stars. We
analyzed a variety of different elements ensembles, namely volatiles,
lithophiles, siderophiles, and Fe. We show that the relative abundances of
oxygen, carbon, and sodium, in addition to iron, are influential indicators of
the presence of a giant planet. We demonstrate the predictive power of our
algorithm by analyzing stars with known giant planets and found that they had
median 75% prediction score. We present a list of ~350 stars with no currently
discovered planets that have a $\geq$90% prediction probability likelihood of
hosting a giant exoplanet. We investigated archival HARPS data and found
significant trends that HIP62345, HIP71803, and HIP10278 host long-period giant
planet companions with estimated minimum $M_p\sin(i)$ values of 3.7, 6.8, and
8.5 M$_{J}$, respectively. We anticipate that our findings will revolutionize
future target selection, the role that elements play in giant planet formation,
and the determination of giant planet interior structure models.

focuses on kinship prediction with image pairs. In this research, we propose a
new deep learning framework for kinship verification in unconstrained videos
using a novel Supervised Mixed Norm regularization Autoencoder (SMNAE). This
new autoencoder formulation introduces class-specific sparsity in the weight
matrix. The proposed three-stage SMNAE based kinship verification framework
utilizes the learned spatio-temporal representation in the video frames for
verifying kinship in a pair of videos. A new kinship video (KIVI) database of
more than 500 individuals with variations due to illumination, pose, occlusion,
ethnicity, and expression is collected for this research. It comprises a total
of 355 true kin video pairs with over 250,000 still frames. The effectiveness
of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the KIVI database and six existing
kinship databases. On the KIVI database, SMNAE yields video-based kinship
verification accuracy of 83.18% which is at least 3.2% better than existing
algorithms. The algorithm is also evaluated on six publicly available kinship
databases and compared with best-reported results. It is observed that the
proposed SMNAE consistently yields best results on all the databases

Bayesian optimization techniques for the multi-objective setting are pertinent

methods for multi-objective optimization, both Bayesian and otherwise, are
aimed at recovering the Pareto front of these objectives. However, in certain
cases a practitioner might desire to identify Pareto optimal points only in a
subset of the Pareto front due to external considerations. In this work, we
propose a strategy based on random scalarizations of the objectives that
addresses this problem. Our approach is able to flexibly sample from desired
regions of the Pareto front and, computationally, is considerably cheaper than
most approaches for MOO. We also study a notion of regret in the

vorticity rings, is numerously generated inside the domain during flow
transition. These new vorticity rings are found around the hairpin vortex heads

buildup of the vortices according to the vorticity transport equation. On the
other hand, vortex buildup is a consequence of vorticity line stretching,
tilting and twisting. Both new vorticity and new vortices are generated during
the flow transition. According to the Helmholtz vorticity flux conservation
law, vorticity line cannot be interrupted, started, or ended inside the flow

goal is to select a small subset of key frames from the input video to create a

Most of the current state-of-the-art video summarization approaches use
supervised learning and require labeled training data. Each training instance
consists of a raw input video and its ground truth summary video curated by
human annotators. However, it is very expensive and difficult to create such

approach that learns to generate optimal video summaries using a set of raw

correspondence between $V$ and $S$. We argue that this type of data is much
easier to collect. Our model aims to learn a mapping function $F : V

$F(V)$ is similar to the distribution of $S$ with the help of an adversarial
objective. In addition, we enforce a diversity constraint on $F(V)$ to ensure

M$_{\rm{star}}$, SFR and sSFR through spectral energy distribution fitting
technique. We use a z-dependent sSFR value to distinguish star-forming (SF)
from quiescent galaxies. To analyse the SFR and sSFR history we split our
sample in two redshift bins: galaxies at $0.4 < z < 0.6$ and $0.6 < z < 0.9$.
We separate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxies by
comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at fixed
environment (projected radius) and fixed stellar mass. For the selected
spectroscopic sample of more than 500 galaxies, the well-known correlation
between SFR and $M_{\rm star}$ is already in place at $z \sim 0.9$, for both SF

have shown that this is not the case: small translations or rescalings of the
input image can drastically change the network's prediction. In this paper, we
quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor
data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance.
Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give
invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data
augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to
transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from
the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1)
antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data
augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best. Taken
together, our results indicate that the problem of insuring invariance to small
image transformations in neural networks while preserving high accuracy remains
unsolved.

builds the field in and around the pre-jet mininfilament and triggers that

whose source of energy is not yet well understood. One leading contender for
that energy source is the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves or
turbulent fluctuations. Many wave-heating models for the corona and the solar
wind presume that these fluctuations originate at or below the Sun's
photosphere. However, this paper investigates the idea that magnetic
reconnection may generate an additional source of MHD waves over a gradual
range of heights in the low corona. A time-dependent Monte Carlo simulation of
the mixed-polarity magnetic field is used to predict the properties of
reconnection-driven coronal MHD waves. The total power in these waves is
typically small in comparison to that of photosphere-driven waves, but their
frequencies are much lower. Reconnection-driven waves begin to dominate the

of classification tasks, but their training requires high computational
resources and is often outsourced to third parties. Recent work has shown that
outsourced training introduces the risk that a malicious trainer will return a
backdoored DNN that behaves normally on most inputs but causes targeted
misclassifications or degrades the accuracy of the network when a trigger known
only to the attacker is present. In this paper, we provide the first effective
defenses against backdoor attacks on DNNs. We implement three backdoor attacks
from prior work and use them to investigate two promising defenses, pruning and
fine-tuning. We show that neither, by itself, is sufficient to defend against
sophisticated attackers. We then evaluate fine-pruning, a combination of
pruning and fine-tuning, and show that it successfully weakens or even
eliminates the backdoors, i.e., in some cases reducing the attack success rate
to 0% with only a 0.4% drop in accuracy for clean (non-triggering) inputs. Our
work provides the first step toward defenses against backdoor attacks in deep
neural networks.

hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of baryonic processes on the
bias and scatter of weak lensing mass estimates of clusters. These estimates
are obtained by fitting NFW profiles to mock data using MCMC techniques. In
particular, we examine the difference in estimates between dark matter-only
runs and those including various prescriptions for baryonic physics. We find no
significant difference in the mass bias when baryonic physics is included,
though the overall mass estimates are suppressed when feedback from AGN is
included. For lowest-mass systems for which a reliable mass can be obtained
($M_{200} \approx 2 \times 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$), we find a bias of $\approx
-10$ per cent. The magnitude of the bias tends to decrease for higher mass
clusters, consistent with no bias for the most massive clusters which have
masses comparable to those found in the CLASH and HFF samples. For the lowest
mass clusters, the mass bias is particularly sensitive to the fit radii and the
limits placed on the concentration prior, rendering reliable mass estimates
difficult. The scatter in mass estimates between the dark matter-only and the
various baryonic runs is less than between different projections of individual
clusters, highlighting the importance of triaxiality.

the propagator $i (p^{2}-m_{0}^{2}+i\varepsilon )^{-1}$ for a scalar field by a
similar expression, namely $iZ (p^{2}-m^{2}+i\varepsilon )^{-1}$, where the
shift of the mass from $m_{0}$ to $m$ reflects the mass renormalization and the
constant~$Z$ is the renormalized field strength (or wave-function). We argue
that, contrary to general belief, the non-perturbative value of~$Z$ is not
necessarily equal to zero in case the two-point function of an interacting
quantum field theory is, as expected, more singular on the light-cone than the
corresponding free field two-point function. If, however, (massless) photons or
composite (unstable) particles are present, the condition $Z=0$ follows from
two qualitatively different arguments, one being a theorem due to Buchholz, the
other a criterion due to Weinberg. Hence, the condition $Z=0$ is, after all, a
universal feature of realistic models of elementary particle physics, which
include massless or unstable particles. The results hold within a natural
framework which, in the case of gauge theories, requires Hilbert space
positivity, and therefore the use of non-manifestly covariant gauges.

composite material has the same longitudinal acoustic impedance as water and
therefore the acoustic reflection coefficient is essentially zero over a wide

mold to achieve desired sample shape, which makes them very easy to handle and
to use. Various applications can be envisioned, such the use of

natural frequencies are drawn from a Cauchy, or Lorentzian, distribution, which
allows for a convenient closure of the evolution equations from the

dynamics that emerge from a broader family of natural frequency distributions,
in particular a family of rational distribution functions. We show that, as the
polynomials that characterize the frequency distribution increase in order, the
low dimensional evolution equations become more complicated, but nonetheless
the system dynamics remain simple, displaying a transition from incoherence to
partial synchronization at a critical coupling strength. Using the low
dimensional equations we analytically calculate the critical coupling strength
corresponding to the onset of synchronization and investigate the scaling
properties of the order parameter near the onset of synchronization. These
results agree with calculations from Kuramoto's original self-consistency
framework, but we emphasize that the low dimensional equations approach used
here allows for a true stability analysis categorizing the bifurcations.

within the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating
new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating ""out-of-sample"" is a much
harder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a
technique called neuron editing that learns how neurons encode an edit for a
particular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose
the variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and
generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those
neurons. By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode
fairly complex and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler
distribution shifts to the neuron's activations. We motivate our technique on
an image domain and then move to our two main biological applications: removal

in m12m, stars forming after 10 Gyr (z = 0.34) significantly contaminate the
bulge, at a level higher than is observed at high latitudes in the Milky Way,
implying that its bar cannot have formed as late as in m12m. We also study the

metallicity and age in the equivalent of Baade's Window. The formation of the

large vertex deviation (~ 40 degrees), which becomes negligible for metal-poor

demonstrate that the vertex deviation also varies with stellar age and is large

insurance in Chinese villages. Results show that contextual centrality of the
first-informed individuals has higher predictive power towards the eventual
adoption outcomes than other standard centrality measures. Interestingly, when
the product of diffusion rate $p$ and the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ is
larger than one and diffusion period is long, contextual centrality linearly
scales with eigenvector centrality. This approximation reveals that contextual
centrality identifies scenarios where a higher diffusion rate of individuals
may negatively influence the cascade payoff. Further simulations on the
synthetic and real-world networks show that contextual centrality has the
advantage of selecting an individual whose local neighborhood generates a high
cascade payoff when $p \lambda_1 < 1$. Under this condition, stronger homophily
leads to higher cascade payoff. Our results suggest that contextual centrality
captures more complicated dynamics on networks and has significant implications
for applications, such as information diffusion, viral marketing, and political
campaigns.

novel method to accurately infer the point of origin and destinations of
commuting flows based on individual's spatial-temporal patterns inferred from
Call Detail Records. Our project significantly improves the accuracy upon the
heuristic assignment rules popularly adopted in the literature. Starting with
the historical data of geo-temporal travel patterns for a panel of individuals,
we create, for each person-location, a vector of probability distribution
capturing the likelihood that the person will appear in that location for a
given the time of day. Stacked in this way, the matrix of historical
geo-temporal data enables us to apply Eigen-decomposition and use unsupervised
machine learning techniques to extract commonalities across locations for the
different groups of travelers, which ultimately allows us to make inferences
and create labels, such as home and work, on specific locations. Testing the
methodology on real-world data with known location labels shows that our method
identifies home and workplaces with significant accuracy, improving upon the
most commonly used methods in the literature by 79% and 34%, respectively. Most
importantly, our methodology does not bear any significant computation burden
and is easily scalable and easily expanded to other real-world data with
historical tracking.

imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, referred to as

computational ineffiency and can result in discontinuities at output
boundaries. We propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of
the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. This does not
avoid stitching altogether, but substantially mitigates its limitations. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a vonventional
stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models and two

behaviour there without violating stringent tests of gravity within our Solar
System. They might hence provide viable extensions of the theory of gravity.
Here, we use galaxy kinematics to constrain screened modified gravity models.
We focus on chameleon $f(R)$ gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation
curves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing
state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations from the \textsc{auriga project},
using the \textsc{mg-gadget} code. For a given galaxy, the surface dividing
screened and un-screened regions adopts an oblate shape, reflecting the disc
morphology of the galaxy's mass distribution. At the `screening radius'---the
radius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic
`upturns' are present in both rotation curves and radial acceleration
relations. The locations of these features depend on various factors, such as
the galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value of the
background field amplitude $f_{R0}$. Self-screening of stars and environmental
screening also play a role. For Milky Way-size galaxies, we find that a model
with $|f_{R0}|=10^{-7}$ results in rotation curves that are indistinguishable
from $\Lambda$CDM, while for $|f_{R0}| \geq 2 \times 10^{-6}$ the simulated
galaxies are entirely unscreened, violating Solar System constraints. For
intermediate values, distinct upturns are present. With a careful statistical
analysis of existing samples of observed rotation curves, including lower mass
objects, constraints on $f(R)$ gravity with a sensitivity down to
$|f_{R0}|\sim10^{-7}$ should be possible.

subsamples of galaxy clusters with qualities indicative of disparate accretion

finite alphabet, that is typically used to model a network of interacting
entities. The main feature of a finite dynamical system is its interaction
graph, which indicates which local functions depend on which variables; the
interaction graph is a qualitative representation of the interactions amongst
entities on the network. As such, a major problem is to determine the effect of
the interaction graph on the dynamics of the FDS. In this paper, we are
interested in three main properties of an FDS: the number of images (the
so-called rank), the number of periodic points (the so-called periodic rank)
and the number of fixed points. In particular, we investigate the minimum,
average, and maximum number of images (or periodic points, or fixed points) of

data in order to simplify calculations (for example, ordered categorical or
metric data, location shift alternatives, etc.). We present a unified approach
that covers metric data with and without ties, count data, ordered categorical
data, and even dichotomous data. For that, we calculate the unknown theoretical
quantities such as the variances under the null and relevant alternative
hypothesis by considering the following `synthetic data' approach. We evaluate
data whose empirical distribution functions match with the theoretical
distribution functions involved in the computations of the unknown theoretical
quantities. Then well-known relations for the ranks of the data are used for
the calculations.
  In addition to computing the necessary sample size $N$ for a fixed allocation
proportion $t = n_1/N$, where $n_1$ is the sample size in the first group and
$N = n_1 + n_2$ is the total sample size, we provide an interval for the
optimal allocation rate $t$ which minimizes the total sample size $N$. It turns
out that for certain distributions, a balanced design is optimal. We give a
characterization of these distributions. Furthermore we show that the optimal
choice of $t$ depends on the ratio of the two variances which determine the
variance of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic under the alternative. This is
different from an optimal sample size allocation in case of the normal
distribution model.

the highly structured, hot-phase driven outflows forming, e.g., by thermal SN
energy injection alone. In this Letter we present computations of resonant
Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiation transfer through snapshots of a suite of
stratified disk simulations from the SILCC project. For a range of thermal,
radiative, and kinetic feedback models only simulations including non-thermal
cosmic rays produce Ly$\alpha$ spectra with enhanced red peaks and strong
absorption at line center -- similar to observed systems. The absence of cosmic
ray feedback leads to spectra incompatible with observations. We attribute this
to the smoother neutral gas distribution of cosmic ray supported outflows
within a few kpc from the disk midplane.

especially in medicine, where gene-based diseases such as cancer require better
modeling of cell regulation. Complex models suffer from uncertainty and
experiments are needed to reduce this uncertainty. Because experiments can be
costly and time-consuming it is desirable to determine experiments providing
the most useful information. If a sequence of experiments is to be performed,
experimental design is needed to determine the order. A classical approach is
to maximally reduce the overall uncertainty in the model, meaning maximal
entropy reduction. A recently proposed method takes into account both model
uncertainty and the translational objective, for instance, optimal structural
intervention in gene regulatory networks, where the aim is to alter the
regulatory logic to maximally reduce the long-run likelihood of being in a
cancerous state. The mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) quantifies
uncertainty based on the degree to which model uncertainty affects the
objective. Experimental design involves choosing the experiment that yields the
greatest reduction in MOCU. This paper introduces finite-horizon dynamic
programming for MOCU-based sequential experimental design and compares it to
the greedy approach, which selects one experiment at a time without
consideration of the full horizon of experiments. A salient aspect of the paper
is that it demonstrates the advantage of MOCU-based design over the widely used
entropy-based design for both greedy and dynamic-programming strategies and
investigates the effect of model conditions on the comparative performances.

spatial features from 3D spatial geometric representations of objects such as
point clouds, 3D models, surfaces, and RGB-D data. Current deep learning
approaches learn such features either using structured data representations

limited by the restriction on resolution and tree depth while unstructured
representations creates a challenge due to non-uniformity among data samples.
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-level learning approach on a
multi-level voxel grid to overcome these drawbacks. To demonstrate the utility
of the proposed multi-level learning, we use a multi-level voxel representation
of 3D objects to perform object recognition. The multi-level voxel
representation consists of a coarse voxel grid that contains volumetric
information of the 3D object. In addition, each voxel in the coarse grid that
contains a portion of the object boundary is subdivided into multiple
fine-level voxel grids. The performance of our multi-level learning algorithm
for object recognition is comparable to dense voxel representations while using
significantly lower memory.

is studied in the frame of the field theoretical superfluid cluster model. The
order parameter of the phase transition from the Wigner phase to the
Nambu-Goldstone phase is a superfluid amplitude, square of the moduli of which
is the superfluid density distribution. The zero mode operators due to the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global phase in the finite number of alpha
clusters are rigorously treated. The theory is systematically applied to N
alpha nuclei from12C-52Fe at various condensation rates. In 12C it is found
that the energy levels of the gas-like well-developed alpha cluster states
above the Hoyle state are reproduced well in agreement with experiment for
realistic condensation rates of alpha clusters. The electric E2 and E0
transitions are calculated and found to be sensitive to the condensation rates.
The profound raison d'etre of the alpha cluster gas-like states above the Hoyle
state, whose structure has been interpreted geometrically in the nuclear models
without the order parameter such as the cluster models or ab initio
calculations, is revealed. It is found that in addition to the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes vibrational mode states collective states of the zero mode operators
appear systematically at low excitation energies from the N alpha threshold
energy. These collective states, new-type soft modes in nuclei due to the

efficient approach to search for binary pulsars. A significant part of it is
the harmonic-summing module, which is the research subject of this paper. Most
of the operations in the harmonic-summing module are relatively cheap
operations for FPGAs. The main challenge is the large number of point accesses
to off-chip memory which are not consecutive but irregular. Although
harmonic-summing alone might not be targeted for FPGA acceleration, it is a
part of the pulsar search pipeline that contains many other compute-intensive
modules, which are efficiently executed on FPGA. Hence having the
harmonic-summing also on the FPGA will avoid off-board communication, which
could destroy other acceleration benefits. Two types of harmonic-summing
approaches are investigated in this paper: 1) storing intermediate data in
off-chip memory and 2) processing the input signals directly without storing.
For the second type, two approaches of caching data are proposed and evaluated:
1) preloading points that are frequently touched 2) preloading all necessary
points that are used to generate a chunk of output points. OpenCL is adopted to
implement the proposed approaches. In an extensive experimental evaluation, the
same OpenCL kernel codes are evaluated on FPGA boards and GPU cards. Regarding
the proposed preloading methods, preloading all necessary points method while
reordering the input signals is faster than all the other methods. While in raw
performance a single FPGA board cannot compete with a GPU, in terms of energy
dissipation, GPU costs up to 2.6x times more energy than that of FPGAs in
executing the same NDRange kernels.

Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming
IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With
LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many
kilometers in a single hop and with 1% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network,
any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing
channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases
humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of
IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases.

persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (p-CSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of
LoRaWANs. In this manuscript, we report on the initial design of a p-CSMA
component for the simulation of LoRa networks in ns3. In particular, the

robustness of unsupervised learning. These approaches are successfully utilized
to construct multiple clustering and combine them into a one representative
consensus clustering of an improved quality. The quality of the consensus
clustering is directly depended on fusion functions used in combination. In
this article, the hierarchical clustering ensemble techniques are extended by
introducing a new evolutionary fusion function. In the proposed method,
multiple hierarchical clustering methods are generated via bagging. Thereafter,
the consensus clustering is obtained using the search capability of genetic
algorithm among different aggregated clustering methods made by different
fusion functions. Putting some popular data sets to empirical study, the
quality of the proposed method is compared with regular clustering ensembles.
Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy improvement of the aggregated
clustering results.

stellar kinematics of galaxies. They have unveiled a range of atypical
kinematic phenomena, which require detailed modelling to understand. We present
results from a cosmological simulation that includes stellar and AGN feedback.
We find that the distribution of angles between the gas and stellar angular
momenta of galaxies is not affected by projection effects. We examine five
galaxies ($\approx 6$ per cent of well resolved galaxies) that display atypical
kinematics; two of the galaxies have kinematically distinct cores (KDC), while
the other three have counter-rotating gas and stars. All five form the majority
of their stars in the field, subsequently falling into cosmological filaments
where the relative orientation of the stellar angular momentum and the bulk gas
flow leads to the formation of a counter-rotating gas disc. The accreted gas
exchanges angular momentum with pre-existing co-rotating gas causing it to fall
to the centre of the galaxy. This triggers low-level AGN feedback, which
reduces star formation. Later, two of the galaxies experience a minor merger
(stellar mass ratio $\sim1/10$) with a galaxy on a retrograde orbit compared to
the spin of the stellar component of the primary. This produces the KDCs, and
is a different mechanism than suggested by other works. The role of minor
mergers in the kinematic evolution of galaxies may have been under-appreciated
in the past, and large, high-resolution cosmological simulations will be
necessary to gain a better understanding in this area.

due to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We conduct Newtonian and MOND
simulations of WBs covering a grid of model parameters in the system mass,
semi-major axis, eccentricity and orbital plane. We self-consistently include
the external field (EF) from the rest of the Galaxy on the Solar neighbourhood
using an axisymmetric algorithm. For a given projected separation, WB relative
velocities reach larger values in MOND. The excess is ${\approx 20\%}$ adopting
its simple interpolating function, as works best with a range of Galactic and
extragalactic observations. This causes noticeable MOND effects in accurate
observations of ${\approx 500}$ WBs, even without radial velocity measurements.
  We show that the proposed Theia mission may be able to directly measure the
orbital acceleration of Proxima Centauri towards the 13 kAU-distant $\alpha$
Centauri. This requires an astrometric accuracy of $\approx 1 \, \mu$as over 5
years. We also consider the long-term orbital stability of WBs with different
orbital planes. As each system rotates around the Galaxy, it experiences a
time-varying EF because this is directed towards the Galactic Centre. We
demonstrate approximate conservation of the angular momentum component along
this direction, a consequence of the WB orbit adiabatically adjusting to the
much slower Galactic orbit. WBs with very little angular momentum in this
direction are less stable over Gyr periods. This novel direction-dependent
effect might allow for further tests of MOND.

the more challenging, yet more realistic case of open-set domain adaptation,
where new, unknown classes can be present in the target data. While, in the
unsupervised scenario, one cannot expect to be able to identify each specific
new class, we aim to automatically detect which samples belong to these new
classes and discard them from the recognition process. To this end, we rely on
the intuition that the source and target samples depicting the known classes
can be generated by a shared subspace, whereas the target samples from unknown
classes come from a different, private subspace. We therefore introduce a
framework that factorizes the data into shared and private parts, while
encouraging the shared representation to be discriminative. Our experiments on
standard benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in open-set domain adaptation.

capacity for the fifth-generation (5G) Internet of Things (IoT), the use of

and scheduled simultaneously. This paper considers the energyefficient design
of a multi-pair decode-and-forward relay-based IoT network, in which multiple
sources simultaneously transmit their information to the corresponding
destinations via a relay equipped with a large array. In order to obtain an
accurate yet tractable expression of the EE, firstly, a closed-form expression
of the EE is derived under an idealized simplifying assumption, in which the
location of each device is known by the network. Then, an exact integral-based
expression of the EE is derived under the assumption that the devices are
randomly scattered following a uniform distribution and transmit power of the
relay is equally shared among the destination devices. Furthermore, a simple
yet efficient lower bound of the EE is obtained. Based on this, finally, a
low-complexity energy-efficient resource allocation strategy of the mIoT
network is proposed under the specific qualityof- service (QoS) constraint. The
proposed strategy determines the near-optimal number of relay antennas, the
near-optimal transmit power at the relay and near-optimal density of active
mIoT device pairs in a given coverage area. Numerical results demonstrate the
accuracy of the performance analysis and the efficiency of the proposed

electrons. The low-energy extent of non-thermal emission has only been loosely
quantified. It has been difficult to obtain a lower limit for a possible

Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) to calculate the Differential
Emission Measure (DEM). This improvement over the isothermal approximation and
any single-instrument DEM helps to resolve ambiguities in the range where
thermal and non-thermal emission overlap, and to provide constraints on the

gaussians in $Log(T)$. Non-thermal emission results from a photon spectrum
obtained using a thick-target emission model. Spectra for both instruments are
fit simultaneously in a self-consistent manner.

the exciton signals near the edges, thereby relatively enhancing the excitonic

fluctuations in the vacuum seriously and allowing fluctuations up to some
high-energy cutoff at which Quantum Field Theory is believed to break down, a
parametric resonance effect arises that leads to a slow expansion and
acceleration. In this work, we thoroughly examine the implications of this
proposal by investigating the resulting dynamics. First, we improve upon
numerical calculations in the original work and show that convergence issues
had overshadowed some important effects. Correct calculations reverse some of
the conclusions in [Q. Wang, Z. Zhu, and W. G. Unruh, Phys. Rev. D 95, 103504,

accelerating expansion appears to remain sound. After improving the resolution
and efficiency of the numerical tests, we explore a wider range of cutoff
energies, and examine the effects of multiple particle fields. We introduce a
simple model using the Mathieu equation (a prototypical example of parametric
resonance), and find that it closely matches numerical results in regimes where
its assumptions are valid. Using this model, we extrapolate to find that in a

material, namely janus-MoSTe, which exhibits a strong build-in electric field.
Our results show that in janus-MoSTe monolayer, the exciton consisting of
electron and hole has a relatively wide spatial extension and low binding
energy. In addition, a slow electron-hole recombination process is observed,
with timescale on the order of 1.31 ns, which is even comparable with those of
van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Further analysis reveals that the
extremely long timescale for electron-hole recombination could be ascribed to
the strong Coulomb screening effect as well as the small overlap of
wavefunctions between electrons and holes. Our findings establish the build-in
electric field as an effective factor to control the electron-hole
recombination dynamics in TMD monolayers and facilitate their future
applications in light detecting and harvesting.

learning algorithms with the goal of improving treatment policies in
healthcare. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-field within machine learning
that is concerned with learning how to make sequences of decisions so as to
optimize long-term effects. Already, RL algorithms have been proposed to
identify decision-making strategies for mechanical ventilation, sepsis
management and treatment of schizophrenia. However, before implementing
treatment policies learned by black-box algorithms in high-stakes clinical
decision problems, special care must be taken in the evaluation of these
policies.
  In this document, our goal is to expose some of the subtleties associated
with evaluating RL algorithms in healthcare. We aim to provide a conceptual
starting point for clinical and computational researchers to ask the right
questions when designing and evaluating algorithms for new ways of treating
patients. In the following, we describe how choices about how to summarize a
history, variance of statistical estimators, and confounders in more ad-hoc
measures can result in unreliable, even misleading estimates of the quality of
a treatment policy. We also provide suggestions for mitigating these
effects---for while there is much promise for mining observational health data
to uncover better treatment policies, evaluation must be performed
thoughtfully.

In order to make our model come closer to reality, we introduce two kinds of
noises, namely, Gaussian noise and outliers. When we evaluate a target
localization algorithm, its localization accuracy and computational complexity
are two main criteria. To improve the positioning accuracy, the original
problem is formulated as solving a non-smooth constrained optimization problem

address this non-smooth optimization problem, this paper proposes two
modifications based on the LPNN framework. In the first method, a

fields in curved spacetime. For relic gravitational wave generated during
inflation, regularization on all $k$-modes of the power spectrum to 2nd
adiabatic order, and of the energy density and pressure to 4th order,
respectively, causes low-frequency distortions. To avoid these, we regularize
only the short modes inside the horizon during inflation (corresponding to the
present frequencies $f \gtrsim 10^{9}$Hz), and keep the long modes intact.
Doing this does not violate the energy conservation since the $k$-modes of RGW
are independent of each other during inflation. The resulting spectra are UV
convergent and simultaneously free of low-frequency distortion, and these
properties remain in the present spectra after evolution, in contrast to
regularization at the present time which has some distortion or irregularities.
The spectra generally exhibit quick oscillations in frequency domain, even if
the initial spectra during inflation have no oscillations. This pattern is due
to the interference between the positive and negative frequency modes developed
during cosmic expansion, and may be probed by future RGW detections.

redundancies. To reduce redundancies without sacrificing parallelism, we
further propose SLFE, a distributed graph processing system, designed with the
principle of ""start late or finish early"". SLFE employs a novel preprocessing
stage to obtain a graph's topological knowledge with negligible overhead.
SLFE's redundancy-aware vertex-centric computation model can then utilize such
knowledge to reduce the redundant computations at runtime. SLFE also provides a
set of APIs to improve the programmability. Our experiments on an 8-node
high-performance cluster show that SLFE outperforms all well-known distributed
graph processing systems on real-world graphs (yielding up to 74.8x speedup).
SLFE's redundancy-reduction schemes are generally applicable to other
vertex-centric graph processing systems.

spectroscopic redshift data alone to identify the substructures and the
surrounding groups of galaxy clusters, along with their member galaxies. Based
on the estimated binding energy of galaxy pairs, the algorithm builds a binary
tree that hierarchically arranges all the galaxies in the field of view. The
algorithm searches for buds, corresponding to gravitational potential minima on
the binary tree branches; for each bud, the algorithm combines the number of
galaxies, their velocity dispersion and their average pairwise distance into a
parameter that discriminates between the buds that do not correspond to any
substructure or group, and thus eventually die, and the buds that correspond to
substructures and groups, and thus bloom into the identified structures. We
test our new algorithm with a sample of 300 mock redshift surveys of clusters
in different dynamical states; the clusters are extracted from a large
cosmological $N$-body simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM model. We limit our analysis
to substructures and surrounding groups identified in the simulation with mass
larger than $10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$. With mock redshift surveys with 200
galaxies within 6 $h^{-1}$~Mpc from the cluster center, the technique recovers
$ 80$\% of the real substructures and $ 60$\% of the surrounding groups; in
$57$\% of the identified structures, at least 60\% of the member galaxies of
the substructures and groups belong to the same real structure. These results
improve by roughly a factor of two the performance of the best substructure
identification algorithm currently available, the $\sigma$ plateau algorithm,
and suggest that our Blooming Tree Algorithm can be an invaluable tool for
detecting substructures of galaxy clusters and investigating their complex

the observed EUV waves were accompanied by ares and coronal jets, but without
CMEs that were regarded as the driver of most EUV waves in previous studies. In
the first case, it is observed that a coronal jet ejected along a
transequatorial loop system at a plane-of-the-sky (POS) speed of $335 \pm 22$
km/s, in the meantime, an arc-shaped EUV wave appeared on the eastern side of
the loop system. In addition, the EUV wave further interacted with another
interconnecting loop system and launched a fast propagating (QFP) magnetosonic
wave along the loop system, which had a period of 200 s and a speed of $388 \pm
65$ km/s, respectively. In the second case, we also observed a coronal jet
ejected at a POS speed of $282 \pm 44$ km/s along a transequatorial loop system
and the generation of bright EUV wave on the eastern side of the loop system.
Based on the observational results, we propose that the observed EUV waves on
the eastern side of the transequatorial loop systems are fast-mode magnetosonic
waves, and they were driven by the sudden lateral expansion of the
transequatorial loop systems due to the direct impingement of the associated
coronal jets, while the QFP wave in the first case formed due to the dispersive
evolution of the disturbance caused by the interaction between the EUV wave and
the interconnecting coronal loops. It is noted that EUV waves driven by sudden
loop expansions have shorter lifetimes than those driven by CMEs.

reaction-diffusion processes. Some of these schemes that are based on the

the cell such as volume exclusion and diffusion-influenced reactions.
Nonetheless, schemes based on the high-resolution microscopic lattice method
(MLM) can directly simulate these effects by representing each finite-sized
molecule explicitly as a random walker on fine lattice voxels. The theory and
consistency of MLM in simulating diffusion-influenced reactions have not been
clarified in detail. Here, we examine MLM in solving diffusion-influenced
reactions in 3D space by employing the Spatiocyte simulation scheme. Applying
the random walk theory, we construct the general theoretical framework
underlying the method and obtain analytical expressions for the total rebinding
probability and the effective reaction rate. By matching Collins-Kimball and
lattice-based rate constants, we obtained the exact expressions to determine
the reaction acceptance probability and voxel size. We found that the size of
voxel should be about 2% larger than the molecule. MLM is validated by
numerical simulations, showing good agreement with the off-lattice
particle-based method, eGFRD. MLM run time is more than an order of magnitude
faster than eGFRD when diffusing macromolecules with typical concentrations in

captures the non-classical reaction kinetics caused by anomalous diffusion of

formation, triggering, and eruption physics. It is observed that the
double-decker filament was formed by splitting of an original single filament.
During the splitting process, intermittent bright point bursts are observed in
the filament channel, which resulted in the generation of the upper filament
branch. The eruption of the newly formed double-decker filament was possibly
triggered by two recurrent two-sided loop jets in the filament channel and the
continuous mass unloading from the upper filament body. The interaction between
the first jet and the filament directly resulted in the unstable of the lower
branch and the fast rising phase of the upper branch. The second jet occurred
at the same site about three hours after the first one, which further disturbed
and accelerated the rising of the lower filament branch. It is interesting that
the rising lower branch overtook the upper one, and then the two branches
probably merged into one filament. Finally, the whole filament erupted
violently and caused a large-scale coronal mass ejection, leaving behind a pair
of flare ribbons and two dimming regions on the both sides of the filament
channel. We think that the intermittent bursts may directly result in the
rearrangement of the filament magnetic field and therefore the formation of the
double-decker filament, then the recurrent jets further caused the fully
eruption of the entire filament system. The study provides convincing evidence
for supporting the scenario that a double-decker filament can be formed by
splitting a single filament into two branches.

first few days, reported so far for a few type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), has been
suggested to be interaction of the SN ejecta either with a non-degenerate
companion star or circumstellar media (CSM). Recently, another mechanism has
been suggested within the context of the He detonation-triggered SN scenario
(i.e., double detonation scenario or He-ignited violent merger), in which the
radioactive isotopes in the outermost layer of the SN ejecta produce the early
emission. In this paper, we investigate properties of the early-phase excessive
emission predicted by these different scenarios. The He detonation scenario
shows different behaviors in the early flash than the companion/CSM interaction
scenarios. Especially clear diagnostics is provided once the behaviors in the
UV and in the optical are combined. The spectra synthesized for the He
detonation scenario are characterized by the absorptions due to the He
detonation products, which especially develop in the decay phase. We further
expect a relation between the properties of the early-phase flash and those of
the maximum SN emission, in a way the brighter and slower initial flash is
accompanied by a more substantial effect of the additional absorptions (and
reddening). This relation, however, should be considered together with the
maximum luminosity of the SN, since the larger luminosity suppresses the effect
of the additional absorption. With these expected features, we address the
possible origins of the observed excessive early-phase emission for a few SNe.

the fractions of prolate, oblate and spheroidal galaxies in each redshift and

making the galaxy center baryon dominated. We give probabilities of a galaxy's

b/a and a, which can facilitate target selections of galaxies with specific

capability of approximating any positive definite (PD) similarities. However, a
simple example demonstrates the fundamental limitation of IPS to approximate
non-PD similarities. We then propose a novel model named Shifted IPS (SIPS)
that approximates any Conditionally PD (CPD) similarities arbitrary well. CPD
is a generalization of PD with many examples such as negative Poincar\'e

significantly improve the applicability of graph embedding without taking great
care in configuring the similarity function. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the SIPS's superiority over IPS. In theory, we further extend SIPS
beyond CPD by considering the inner product in Minkowski space so that it
approximates more general similarities.

follows. In the enrollment stage, an individual provides a biometric signal
that is mapped into a secret key and a helper message, the former being
prepared to become available to the system at a later time (for
authentication), and the latter is stored in a public database. When an
authorized user requests authentication, claiming his/her identity as one of
the subscribers, he/she has to provide a biometric signal again, and then the
system, which retrieves also the helper message of the claimed subscriber,
produces an estimate of the secret key, that is finally compared to the secret
key of the claimed user. In case of a match, the authentication request is
approved, otherwise, it is rejected.
  Evidently, there is an inherent tension between two desired, but conflicting,
properties of the helper message encoder: on the one hand, the encoding should
be informative enough concerning the identity of the real subscriber, in order
to approve him/her in the authentication stage, but on the other hand, it
should not be too informative, as otherwise, unauthorized imposters could
easily fool the system and gain access. A good encoder should then trade off
the two kinds of errors: the false reject (FR) error and the false accept (FA)
error.
  In this work, we investigate trade-offs between the random coding FR error
exponent and the best achievable FA error exponent. We compare two types of
ensembles of codes: fixed-rate codes and variable-rate codes, and we show that
the latter class of codes offers considerable improvement compared to the
former. In doing this, we characterize the optimal rate functions for both
types of codes. We also examine privacy leakage constraints for both fixed-rate
codes and variable-rate codes.

the compression of a turbulent field can lead to a sudden viscous dissipation
of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and suggested this mechanism could
potentially be used to design new fast-ignition schemes for inertial
confinement fusion. We expand on previous work by accounting for finite Mach
numbers, rather than relying on a zero-Mach-limit assumption as previously
done. The finite-Mach-number formulation is necessary to capture a
self-consistent feedback mechanism in which dissipated TKE increases the
temperature of the system, which in turn modifies the viscosity and thus the
TKE dissipation itself. Direct numerical simulations with a tenth-order
accurate Pad\'e scheme were carried out to analyze this self-consistent
feedback loop for compressing turbulence. Results show that, for finite Mach
numbers, the sudden viscous dissipation of TKE still occurs, both for the
solenoidal and dilatational turbulent fields. As the domain is compressed,
oscillations in dilatational TKE are encountered due to the highly-oscillatory
nature of the pressure dilatation. An analysis of the source terms for the
internal energy shows that the mechanical work term dominates the viscous
turbulent dissipation. As a result, the effect of the suddenly dissipated TKE
on temperature is minimal for the Mach numbers tested. Moreover, an analytical
expression is derived that confirms the dissipated TKE does not significantly
alter the temperature evolution for low Mach numbers, regardless of compression
speed. The self-consistent feedback mechanism is thus quite weak for subsonic
turbulence, which could limit its applicability for inertial confinement
fusion.

function at each iteration. Due its connection to Newton's method, IPM is often
classified as second-order method -- a genre that is attached with stability
and accuracy at the expense of scalability. Indeed, computing a Newton step
amounts to solving a large linear system, which can be efficiently implemented
if the input data are reasonably-sized and/or sparse and/or well-structured.
However, in case the above premises fail, then the challenge still stands on
the way for a traditional IPM. To deal with this challenge, one approach is to
apply the iterative procedure, such as preconditioned conjugate gradient
method, to solve the linear system. Since the linear system is different each
iteration, it is difficult to find good pre-conditioner to achieve the overall
solution efficiency. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed.
Instead of applying Newton's method, we resort to the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) to approximately minimize the log-barrier penalty
function at each iteration, under the framework of primal-dual path-following
for a homogeneous self-dual embedded LP model. The resulting algorithm is an
ADMM-Based Interior Point Method, abbreviated as ABIP in this paper. The new
method inherits stability from IPM, and scalability from ADMM. Because of its
self-dual embedding structure, ABIP is set to solve any LP without requiring
prior knowledge about its feasibility. We conduct extensive numerical
experiments testing ABIP with large-scale LPs from NETLIB and machine learning
applications. The results demonstrate that ABIP compares favorably with
existing LP solvers including SDPT3, MOSEK, DSDP-CG and SCS.

training a GAN within the latent variable space. Specifically, our model
samples from the prior and posterior distributions over the latent variables by
transforming context-dependent random noise using neural networks and minimizes
the Wasserstein distance between the two distributions. We further develop a

objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash.
First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated,
rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle
fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one
basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90% accuracy.
Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple
basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a
mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged
probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The
mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex
shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape
parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.

novel results were recently obtained for 2D and 3D systems: SOC suppresses the

communication bandwidth, large propagation delay, and sparse deployment, pose
challenging issues for successful localization of sensor nodes. In addition,
sensor nodes in UWSNs are usually powered by batteries whose replacements
introduce high cost and complexity. Thus, the critical problem in UWSNs is to
enable each sensor node to find enough anchor nodes in order to localize
itself, with minimum energy costs. In this paper, an Energy-Efficient
Localization Algorithm (EELA) is proposed to analyze the decentralized
interactions among sensor nodes and anchor nodes. A
Single-Leader-Multi-Follower Stackelberg game is utilized to formulate the
topology control problem of sensor nodes and anchor nodes by exploiting their
available communication opportunities. In this game, the sensor node acts as a
leader taking into account factors such as 'two-hop' anchor nodes and energy
consumption, while anchor nodes act as multiple followers, considering their
ability to localize sensor nodes and their energy consumption. We prove that
both players select best responses and reach a socially optimal Stackelberg
Nash Equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EELA
improves the perfor- mance of localization in UWSNs significantly, and in
particular the energy cost of sensor nodes. Compared to the baseline schemes,
the energy consumption per node is about 48% lower in EELA, while providing a
desirable localization coverage, under reasonable error and delay.

double-null formalism for studying dynamics within the theory of gravity. By
using the double-null coordinates, we can investigate dynamical black holes and
gravitational phenomena within spherical symmetry, including gravitational
collapse, formation of horizons and singularities, as well as evaporations.
This formalism can be extended to generic situations, where we can change
dimensions, topologies, the gravity sector, as well as the matter sector. We
also discuss its possible implications for black hole physics and particle
astrophysics. This strong numerical tool will have lots of future applications
for various research areas including general relativity, string theory, and
various approaches to quantum gravity.

mechanical oscillator gives rise to a wide range of phenomena: from sideband
cooling and backaction-evading measurements to pondermotive and mechanical
squeezing to entanglement and motional sideband asymmetry. In many protocols,
such as dissipative mechanical squeezing, multiple lasers are utilized, giving
rise to periodically driven optomechanical systems. Here we show that in this
case, Floquet dynamics can arise due to presence of Kerr-type nonlinearities,
which are ubiqitious in optomechanical systems. Specifically, employing
multiple probe tones, we perform sideband asymmetry measurements, a macroscopic
quantum effect, on a silicon optomechanical crystal sideband-cooled to 40%
ground-state occupation. We show that the Floquet dynamics, resulting from the
presence of multiple pump tones, gives rise to an artificially modified
motional sideband asymmetry by redistributing thermal and quantum fluctuations
among the initially independently scattered thermomechanical sidebands. For
pump tones exhibiting large frequency separation, the dynamics is suppressed
and accurate quantum noise thermometry demonstrated. We develop a theoretical
model based on Floquet theory that accurately describes our observations. The
resulting dynamics can be understood as resulting from a synthetic gauge field
among the Fourier modes, which is created by the phase lag of the Kerr-type
response. This novel phenomenon has wide-ranging implications for schemes
utilizing several pumping tones, as commonly employed in backaction-evading
measurements, dissipative optical squeezing, dissipative mechanical squeezing
and quantum noise thermometry. Our observation may equally well be used for
optomechanical Floquet engineering, e.g. generation of topological phases of
sound by periodic time-modulation.

apply the sample reuse technique to the PBIL and the pure rank-$\mu$ update
CMA-ES and empirically investigate its effect. The experimental results show
that the sample reuse helps to reduce the number of function evaluations on

spectrum measurements between $k_{\rm min}$ = 0.03 h/Mpc and $k_{\rm max}$ =

the bias prescription we include (i) simple linear bias; (ii) the McDonald &
Roy model and (iii) its coevolution variant introduced by Saito et al.; and
(iv) a very general model including all terms up to one-loop and corrections
from advection. For the redshift-space modelling we include the Kaiser formula
with exponential damping and the power spectrum provided by (i) tree-level
perturbation theory and (ii) the Halofit prescription; (iii) one-loop
perturbation theory, also with exponential damping; and (iv) an effective field
theory description, also at one-loop, with damping represented by the EFT
subtractions. We quantify the improvement from each layer of modelling by
measuring the typical improvement in chi-square when fitting to a member of the
simulation suite. We attempt to detect overfitting by testing for compatibility
between the best-fit power spectrum per realization and the best-fit over the
entire WizCOLA suite. For both bias and the redshift-space map we find that
increasingly permissive models yield improvements in chi-square but with
diminishing returns. The most permissive models show modest evidence for
overfitting. Accounting for model complexity using the Bayesian Information
Criterion, we argue that standard perturbation theory up to one-loop, or a
related model such as that of Taruya, Nishimichi & Saito, coupled to the
coevolution bias model, is likely to provide a good compromise for near-future
galaxy surveys operating with comparable $k_{\rm max}$.

all over the agricultural field. This practice involves significant waste and

at the right place and at the right time (Precision Agriculture). Nowadays,
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is becoming an interesting acquisition system for
weeds localization and management due to its ability to obtain the images of
the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at low
cost. Despite the important advances in UAV acquisition systems, automatic
weeds detection remains a challenging problem because of its strong similarity
with the crops. Recently Deep Learning approach has shown impressive results in
different complex classification problem. However, this approach needs a
certain amount of training data but, creating large agricultural datasets with
pixel-level annotations by expert is an extremely time consuming task. In this
paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using Convolutional
Neuronal Networks (CNNs) with unsupervised training dataset collection for
weeds detection from UAV images. The proposed method consists in three main
phases. First we automatically detect the crop lines and using them to identify
the interline weeds. In the second phase, interline weeds are used to
constitute the training dataset. Finally, we performed CNNs on this dataset to
build a model able to detect the crop and weeds in the images. The results
obtained are comparable to the traditional supervised training data labeling.
The accuracy gaps are 1.5% in the spinach field and 6% in the bean field.

adversary (so-called Eve) is present in the close vicinity who aims to inject
malicious data into the system by impersonating some Alice node. To this end,
this work first considers an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) UWA channel,
and proposes a novel, multiple-features based, two-step method at the sink node
to thwart the potential impersonation attack by Eve. Specifically, the sink
node exploits the noisy estimates of the distance, the angle of arrival, and
the location of the transmit node as device fingerprints to carry out a number
of binary hypothesis tests (for impersonation detection) as well as a number of
maximum likelihood hypothesis tests (for transmitter identification when no
impersonation is detected). We provide closed-form expressions for the error
probabilities (i.e., the performance) of most of the hypothesis tests. We then
consider the case of a UWA with colored noise and frequency-dependent pathloss,
and derive a maximum-likelihood (ML) distance estimator as well as the
corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then invoke the proposed two-step,
impersonation detection framework by utilizing distance as the sole feature.
Finally, we provide detailed simulation results for both AWGN UWA channel and
the UWA channel with colored noise. Simulation results verify that the proposed

same observable for a vanishing time between both observations. In contrast to
the exclusively quantum-physical collapse description, the equivalent
continuity requirement also applies in classical physics, allowing for a
comparison of both domains. In particular, it is found that quantum coherences
are the single cause for measurable deviations in statistical properties due to
the collapse. Therefore, the introduced approach renders it possible to
characterize and quantify the unique features of the quantum-physical
measurement problem within the framework of modern quantum resource theories
and compare them to classical physics.

triggered by a switch in the dominant disk torque responsible for accretion
(paper I). As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions
would change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD).
While JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II),
the existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term.
We investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid
disk configuration. We use the 2T plasma code elaborated in paper II, allowing
to compute outside-in the disk local thermal equilibrium with self-consistent
advection and optically thin-to-thick transitions, in both radiation and gas
supported regimes. The non-local inverse Compton cooling introduced by the
external soft photons is computed by the BELM code. This additional term has a
profound influence on JED solutions, allowing a smooth temperature transition
from the outer SAD to the inner JED. We explore the full parameter space in
disk accretion rate and transition radius, and show that the whole domain in
X-ray fluxes and hardness ratios covered by standard XrB cycles is well
reproduced by such hybrid configurations. Precisely, a reasonable combination
of these parameters allows to reproduce the 3-200 keV spectra of five canonical
XrB states. Along with X-ray signatures, JED-SAD configurations also naturally
account for the radio emission whenever it is observed. By varying only the
transition radius and the accretion rate, hybrid disk configurations combining
an inner JED and an outer SAD are able to reproduce simultaneously the X-ray
spectral states and radio emission of X-ray binaries during their outburst.
Adjusting these two parameters, it is then possible to reproduce a full cycle.
This will be shown in a forthcoming paper (paper IV).

signal by superposing it with a stronger one. This principle has been
demonstrated also for weak signals at the quantum level, down to a single

optical mixing between a strong macroscopic source and a single photon can be
further enhanced as to allow the sensing the wavefront of the photon's mode
simultaneously at two or more locations. Key conditions for that detection is
reducing the active size of the detectors below the typical size of the
transverse modes, and performing an optical intensity correlation measurement
of the Hanbury Brown and Twiss type. Due to the inherent amplification effect
of the mixing process, a macroscopic signal is extracted, out of which the
photon wave-front characterization at more than one location is achievable with
good fidelity even for a single photon emission event. A basic scheme is

tend to decrease significantly when evaluated on different image domains
compared with those used for training, which demonstrates the lack of
adaptability of CNNs to unseen imaging data. In this study, we analyzed the
effect of intensity domain adaptation on our recently proposed CNN-based MS
lesion segmentation method. Given a source model trained on two public MS
datasets, we investigated the transferability of the CNN model when applied to
other MRI scanners and protocols, evaluating the minimum number of annotated
images needed from the new domain and the minimum number of layers needed to
re-train to obtain comparable accuracy. Our analysis comprised MS patient data
from both a clinical center and the public ISBI2015 challenge database, which
permitted us to compare the domain adaptation capability of our model to that
of other state-of-the-art methods. For the ISBI2015 challenge, our one-shot
domain adaptation model trained using only a single image showed a performance
similar to that of other CNN methods that were fully trained using the entire
available training set, yielding a comparable human expert rater performance.
We believe that our experiments will encourage the MS community to incorporate
its use in different clinical settings with reduced amounts of annotated data.
This approach could be meaningful not only in terms of the accuracy in
delineating MS lesions but also in the related reductions in time and economic
costs derived from manual lesion labeling.

the task of assigning labels to every unlabeled node using information from the

influenced by its immediate neighbors but also by higher order neighbors,
multiple hops away. Recent state-of-the-art models for CC learn end-to-end
differentiable variations of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernels to aggregate
multi-hop neighborhood information. In this work, we propose a Higher Order
Propagation Framework, HOPF, which provides an iterative inference mechanism
for these powerful differentiable kernels. Such a combination of classical
iterative inference mechanism with recent differentiable kernels allows the
framework to learn graph convolutional filters that simultaneously exploit the
attribute and label information available in the neighborhood. Further, these
iterative differentiable kernels can scale to larger hops beyond the memory
limitations of existing differentiable kernels. We also show that existing WL
kernel-based models suffer from the problem of Node Information Morphing where
the information of the node is morphed or overwhelmed by the information of its
neighbors when considering multiple hops. To address this, we propose a
specific instantiation of HOPF, called the NIP models, which preserves the node
information at every propagation step. The iterative formulation of NIP models
further helps in incorporating distant hop information concisely as summaries
of the inferred labels. We do an extensive evaluation across 11 datasets from
different domains. We show that existing CC models do not provide consistent
performance across datasets, while the proposed NIP model with iterative

common design theme for both biological and synthetic materials. Transient
bonds can provide mechanical rigidity, while still allowing for visco-elastic
flows on timescales longer than the bond lifetime. In many biological polymer
networks such as the actin cytoskeleton, the short-lived bonds are formed by
accessory proteins that diffuse away after unbinding. By contrast, bonds in
synthetic networks, such as the pendant groups of telechelic polymers, can only
rebind in the same location. Using a recently developed theoretical model of
the fracturing of visco-elastic materials, we here investigate the effect of
linker mobility on the bond dynamics of a network under stress. We find that
although mean field properties such as the average bond linker lifetime are
barely affected by bond mobility, networks cross linked by mobile bonds
fracture more readily due to 'leaking' of linkers from crack areas to less
stressed regions within the network. We propose a theoretical model to describe
the redistribution of mobile linkers, which we validate by simulations. Our
work offers insight into a potential trade-off that cells face, between
fracture strength versus the modularity and tight dynamic control offered by
mobile linkers.

These rates can be integrated in stochastic simulations of reaction-diffusion
systems that follow a mesoscopic approach, i.e., that partition the environment
into homogeneous subvolumes and apply the spatial stochastic simulation
algorithm (spatial SSA). The rates are derived by integrating Fick's second law
over a single subvolume in one dimension (1D), and are also shown to apply in
three dimensions (3D). The proposed algorithm corrects the derived rates to
ensure that they are physically meaningful and it is implemented in the AcCoRD
simulator (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion). Simulations using
the proposed method are compared with a naive mesoscopic approach, microscopic
simulations that track every molecule, and analytical results that are exact in
1D and an approximation in 3D. By choosing subvolumes that are sufficiently
small, such that the Peclet number associated with a subvolume is sufficiently
less than 2, the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable with the
microscopic method, thus enabling the simulation of
advection-reaction-diffusion systems with the spatial SSA.

highlighted two-photon exchange contributions as a necessary ingredient in
theoretical calculations to precisely evaluate hydrogen elastic scattering
cross sections. This correction can modify the cross section at the few percent
level. In contrast, dispersive effects can cause significantly larger changes
from the Born approximation. The purpose of this experiment is to extract the
carbon-12 elastic cross section around the first diffraction minimum, where the
Born term contributions to the cross section are small to maximize the
sensitivity to dispersive effects. The analysis uses the LEDEX data from the
high resolution Jefferson Lab Hall A spectrometers to extract the cross
sections near the first diffraction minimum of 12C at beam energies of 362 MeV
and 685 MeV. The results are in very good agreement with previous world data,
although with less precision. The average deviation from a static nuclear
charge distribution expected from linear and quadratic fits indicate a 30.6%
contribution of dispersive effects to the cross section at 1 GeV. The magnitude
of the dispersive effects near the first diffraction minimum of 12C has been
confirmed to be large with a strong energy dependence and could account for a
large fraction of the magnitude for the observed quenching of the longitudinal
nuclear response. These effects could also be important for nuclei radii
extracted from parity-violating asymmetries measured near a diffraction
minimum.

composed only by two energy levels, includes two interacting terms. A first
one, the $V$ interaction, which promotes or degrade pairs of particles, and a
second one, the $W$ interaction, which scatters one particle in the upper and
another in the lower energy level. In comparing this model with other
approximation methods, the $W$ term interaction is often set to zero. In this
paper, we show how the presence of this interaction changes the global
structure of the system, generates degeneracies between the various eigenstates
and modifies the energy eigenvalues structure. We present analytical solutions
for systems of two and three particles and, for some specific cases, also for
four, six and eight particles. The solutions for systems with more than eight
particles are only numerical but their behaviour can be well understood by
considering the extrapolations of the analytical results. Of particular

estimate the state and pose of a mono camera using extended Kalman filter. By
using accelerated KAZE features and a more rigorous feature rejection routine

thin and thick components. Also considered is a control simulation where all of
the halo mass is smoothly distributed. We find that bending waves are more
vigorously excited in the thin disc than the thick one and that they are
strongest in the outer regions of the disc, especially at late times. By way of
a Fourier decomposition, we find that the complicated pattern of bending across
the disc can be described as a superposition of waves, which concentrate along
two branches in the radius-rotational frequency plane. These branches
correspond to vertical resonance curves as predicted by a WKB analysis. Bending
waves in the simulation with substructure have a higher amplitude than those in
the smooth-halo simulation, though the frequency-radius characteristics of the
waves in the two simulations are very similar. A cross correlation analysis of
vertical displacement and bulk vertical velocity suggests that the waves
oscillate largely as simple plane waves. We suggest that the wave-like features
in astrometric surveys such as the Second Data Release from \textit{Gaia} may
be due to long-lived waves of a dynamically active disc rather than, or in
addition to, perturbations from a recent satellite-disc encounter.

i.i.d. random vector $X^{k}$ with distribution $P_{X}^{k}$ to simulate an
$n$-dimensional i.i.d. random vector $Y^{n}$ so that its distribution is
approximately $Q_{Y}^{n}$. In contrast to previous works, in this paper we
consider the standard R\'enyi divergence and two variants of all orders to
measure the level of approximation. These two variants are the max-R\'enyi
divergence $D_{\alpha}^{\mathsf{max}}(P,Q)$ and the sum-R\'enyi divergence
$D_{\alpha}^{+}(P,Q)$. When $\alpha=\infty$, these two measures are strong
because for any $\epsilon>0$, $D_{\infty}^{\mathsf{max}}(P,Q)\leq\epsilon$ or
$D_{\infty}^{+}(P,Q)\leq\epsilon$ implies
$e^{-\epsilon}\leq\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\leq e^{\epsilon}$ for all $x$. Under these
R\'enyi divergence measures, we characterize the asymptotics of normalized
divergences as well as the R\'enyi conversion rates. The latter is defined as
the supremum of $\frac{n}{k}$ such that the R\'enyi divergences vanish
asymptotically. In addition, when the R\'enyi parameter is in the interval
$(0,1)$, the R\'enyi conversion rates equal the ratio of the Shannon entropies
$\frac{H\left(P_{X}\right)}{H\left(Q_{Y}\right)}$, which is consistent with
traditional results in which the total variation measure was adopted. When the
R\'enyi parameter is in the interval $(1,\infty]$, the R\'enyi conversion rates
are, in general, smaller than
$\frac{H\left(P_{X}\right)}{H\left(Q_{Y}\right)}$. When specialized to the case
in which either $P_{X}$ or $Q_{Y}$ is uniform, the simulation problem reduces
to the source resolvability and intrinsic randomness problems. The preceding
results are used to characterize the asymptotics of R\'enyi divergences and the
R\'enyi conversion rates for these two cases.

In a perturbed Friedmann model, the difference of the Hubble constants
measured in two rest-frames is independent of the source peculiar velocity and
depends only on the relative velocity of the observers, to lowest order in
velocity. Therefore this difference should be zero when averaging over
sufficient sources, which are at large enough distances to suppress local
nonlinear inhomogeneity. We use a linear perturbative analysis to predict the
Doppler effects on redshifts and distances. Since the observed redshifts encode
the effect of local bulk flow due to nonlinear structure, our linear analysis
is able to capture aspects of the nonlinear behaviour. Using the largest

GANs may fail to model the full distribution (""mode collapse"") and that using
the learned models for anything other than generating samples may be very

statistical models of images by comparing them to perhaps the simplest
statistical model, the Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we present a simple
method to evaluate generative models based on relative proportions of samples
that fall into predetermined bins. Unlike previous automatic methods for
evaluating models, our method does not rely on an additional neural network nor
does it require approximating intractable computations. Second, we compare the
performance of GANs to GMMs trained on the same datasets. While GMMs have
previously been shown to be successful in modeling small patches of images, we
show how to train them on full sized images despite the high dimensionality.
Our results show that GMMs can generate realistic samples (although less sharp
than those of GANs) but also capture the full distribution, which GANs fail to
do. Furthermore, GMMs allow efficient inference and explicit representation of
the underlying statistical structure. Finally, we discuss how GMMs can be used
to generate sharp images.

microlensing events. In such events, the center-of-light motion of a star
lensed by a NS will deviate from the expected non-lensed motion and this
deviation can be used to measure the mass of the NS. I search for future
conjunctions between pulsars, with measured proper motion, and stars in the
GAIA-DR2 catalog. I identified one candidate event of a star that will possibly
be lensed by a pulsar during the next ten years in which the expected light
deflection of the background star will deviate from the non-lensed motion by
more than 0.05 mas. Given the position and proper motion of PSR J0846-3533, it
will possibly pass ~0.2"" from a 19.0 G magnitude background star in 2022.9.
Assuming a 1.4 solar mass NS, the expected maximum deviation of the background
star images from the uniform-rate plus parallax motion will be 0.091 mas. This
pulsar position has a relatively large uncertainty and therefore additional
observations are required in order to verify this event. I briefly discuss the
opposite case, in which a pulsar is being lensed by a star. Such events can be
used to measure the stellar mass via pulsar timing measurements. I do not find
good candidates for such events with predicted variations in the pulsar period
derivative, divided by 1 s, exceeding 10^-20 s^-1. Since only about 10% of the
known pulsars have measured proper motions, there is potential for an increase
in the number of predicted pulsar lensing events.

excitation are used to evaluate the intensity of the H I Lyman-{\alpha} and
Lyman-{\beta} lines, in two prominence points where simultaneous and cospatial
LASCO-C2 and UVCS data were available. Thermodynamic and geometrical parameters
assumed for the calculation are provided by both observations and the results
of a detailed 1D non-LTE radiative-transfer model of the prominence, developed
in our previous work (Heinzel 2016). The filling factor is derived from the
comparison between the calculated and the measured intensities of the two
lines. The results are then checked against the non-LTE model in order to
verify the reliability of the methods. The resulting filling factors are
consistent with the model in both the prominence points when the separation of
the radiative and collisional components of the total intensity, required to
estimate the filling factor, is performed using both the line intensities. An
exploration of the parameter space shows that the results are weakly sensitive
to the plasma velocity, but they depends more strongly on the assumed kinetic
temperatures. The combination of visible-light and ultraviolet Lyman-{\alpha}
and Lyman-{\beta} data can be used to approximately estimate the geometrical
filling factor in erupting prominences, but the proposed techniques are
reliable only for emission that is optically thin in the lines considered,

us to model a set of CNN features by a convex cone and measure the geometric
similarity of convex cones for classification. To establish this framework, we
sequentially define multiple angles between two convex cones by repeating the
alternating least squares method and then define the geometric similarity
between the cones using the obtained angles. Moreover, to enhance our method,
we introduce a discriminant space, maximizing the between-class variance (gaps)
and minimizes the within-class variance of the projected convex cones onto the
discriminant space, similar to a Fisher discriminant analysis. Finally,
classification is based on the similarity between projected convex cones. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated experimentally using a
private, multi-view hand shape dataset and two public databases.

temperatures at which simulations can be run till a steady state is reached

Synthetic Aperture Radar (DSAR) system. The idealized air- or space-borne
system transmits a continuous wave at a fixed frequency and a co-located
receiver measures the resulting scattered waves; a windowed Fourier transform
then converts the raw data into a function of two variables: slow time and
frequency. Under simplifying assumptions, we analyze the linearized forward
scattering map and the feasibility of inverting it via filtered backprojection,
using techniques of microlocal analysis which robustly describe how sharp
features in the target appear in the data. For DSAR with a straight flight
path, there is, as with conventional SAR, a left-right ambiguity artifact in
the DSAR image, which can be avoided via beam forming to the left or right. For
a circular flight path, the artifact has a more complicated structure, but
filtering out echoes coming from straight ahead or behind the transceiver, as
well as those outside a critical range, allows one to obtain an artifact-free
image. Initially derived under a start-stop approximation widely used in
range-based SAR, we show that some of these results are robust and hold under a
more realistic approximation.

the employment of effective deep neural networks (DNNs) on the policy networks.
With the great effectiveness came serious vulnerability issues with DNNs that
small adversarial perturbations on the input can change the output of the

network can be manipulated against achieving the original task through a
sequence of small perturbations on the input states. In this paper, we
demonstrate furthermore that it is also possible to impose an arbitrary

only one detection towards quiescent molecular clouds, in the $\rho$ Oph A

lower abundance than the [O$_2$]/[CH$_3$OH] ratio of $5-15$ found in comet

of the dense cloud precursor of IRAS16293 with respect to the one at the origin
of our Solar System that prevented an efficient formation of O$_2$ in
interstellar ices.

formulated using the negative Gibbs free energy or the complementary strain
energy density, should be used as the basis for the plastic part of
elasto-plastic constitutive models. Thus, the yield surface may be assumed as
an elastic potential surface for a specific level of critical complementary
strain energy density. Here, rate-independent homogenous continuous materials
under isothermal conditions are considered. Visualization of elastic potentials
using principal stresses is presented. The proposed approach improves the total
strain energy criterion because: (1) the elastic potential does not have to be
centred at the current stress state and, consequently, is able to reproduce a
tension-compression asymmetry; (2) the corresponding correlation between the
Poisson's ratio and the shape of the yield surface is found for soils and
metallic glasses; (3) non-linear elasticity is considered, which notably
increases the flexibility and capabilities of the proposed approach.
Ultimately, and similarly to hyperelasticity, the proposed framework for
deriving (associated) yield surfaces may be considered just as a classifying
criterion and a possible approach to formulate yield surfaces. Finally, if an
associated flow rule is also assumed, the elastic potential, yield and plastic
potential surfaces coincide.

the full set of Eliashberg equations. In this way, the electron filling can
accurately be kept at a constant level at any temperature. Solving the coupled
equations self-consistently, and with focus on the interfacial electron-phonon

a risk perspective. We propose to select the machine-labeled instances at high
risk of being mislabeled for manual verification. For this task, we present a
risk model that takes into consideration the human-labeled instances as well as
the output of machine resolution. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the
proposed risk model on real data. Our experiments demonstrate that it can pick
up the mislabeled instances with considerably higher accuracy than the existing
alternatives. Provided with the same amount of human cost budget, it can also
achieve better resolution quality than the state-of-the-art approach based on
active learning.

used in various applications. In this paper we focused on deterministic regular
expressions (DREs). Considering that researchers didn't have large datasets as
evidence before, we first harvested a large corpus of real data from the Web
then conducted a practical study to investigate the usage of DREs. One feature
of our work is that the data set is sufficiently large compared with previous
work, which is obtained using several data collection strategies we proposed.
The results show more than 98\% of expressions in Relax NG are DRE, and more
than 56\% of expressions from RegExLib are DRE, while both Relax NG and
RegExLib do not have the determinism constraint. These observations indicate
that DREs are commonly used in practice. The results also show further study of
subclasses of DREs is necessary. As far as we know, we are the first to analyze
the determinism and the subclasses of DREs of Relax NG and RegExLib, and give
these results. Furthermore, we give some discussions and applications of the
data set. We obtain a DRE data set from the original data, which will be useful
in practice and it has value in its own right. We find current research in new
subclasses of DREs is insufficient, therefore it is necessary to do further
study. We also analyze the referencing relationships among XSDs and define
SchemaRank, which can be used in XML Schema design.

characterize, implement in software and numerically test the optimal
minimum-energy Settable-Complexity Bandwidth Manager (SCBM) for the live

proposed SCBM are that: (i) its implementation complexity is settable on-line

tradeoff; (ii) it minimizes the network energy consumed by the wireless device
for sustaining the migration process under hard constraints on the tolerated
migration times and downtimes; and, (iii) by leveraging a suitably designed
adaptive mechanism, it is capable to quickly react to (possibly, unpredicted)
fading and/or mobility-induced abrupt changes of the wireless environment
without requiring forecasting. The actual effectiveness of the proposed SCBM is
supported by extensive energy-vs.-delay performance comparisons, that cover:
(i) a number of heterogeneous 3G/4G/WiFi FOGRAN scenarios; (ii) synthetic and

observations instead of the more generally used transit times. We apply this
methodology to the Kepler-138 planetary system. The derived planetary bulk
densities are a factor of 2 more precise than previous determinations, and we
find a discrepancy in the stellar bulk density with respect to a previous
study. This leads, in turn, to a discrepancy in the determination of masses and
radii of the star and the planets. In particular, we find that interior planet,
Kepler-138b, has a size in between Mars and the Earth. Given our mass and
density estimates, we characterize the planetary interiors using a generalized

degeneracy and calculate confidence regions of interior parameters such as
thicknesses of the core, the mantle, and ocean and gas layers. We find that

For example, previous
studies in spectral space found that supergranulation has wave-like properties.
Here we study, in real space, the wave-like evolution of the average
supergranule over a range of spatial scales (from 10 to 80 Mm). We complement
this by characterizing the evolution of the associated network magnetic field.
We use one year of data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to
measure horizontal near-surface flows near the solar equator by applying
time-distance helioseismology on Dopplergrams and granulation tracking on
intensity images. The average supergranule outflow (or inflow) is constructed
by averaging over 10000 individual outflows (or inflows). The contemporaneous
evolution of the magnetic field is studied with HMI line-of-sight observations.
We confirm and extend previous measurements of the supergranular wave
dispersion relation to angular wavenumbers in the range 50<kR<270. We find a
plateau for kR>120. In real space, larger supergranules undergo oscillations
with longer periods and lifetimes than smaller cells. We find excellent
agreement between TD and LCT and obtain wave properties that are independent of
the tracking rate. The observed network magnetic field follows the oscillations
of the supergranular flows with a six-hour time lag. This behavior can be
explained by computing the motions of corks carried by the supergranular flows.
Signatures of supergranular waves in surface horizontal flows near the solar
equator can be observed in real space. These oscillatory flows control the
evolution of the network magnetic field, in particular they explain the
recently discovered east-west anisotropy of the magnetic field around the
average supergranule. Background flow measurements that we obtain from Doppler
frequency shifts do not favor shallow models of supergranulation.

uncertainties associated with dependence modeling when data for characterizing
probability models are limited. Practically, the system inputs are often
assumed to be mutually independent or correlated by a multivariate Gaussian
distribution. However, this subjective assumption may introduce bias in the
response estimate if the real dependence structure deviates from this
assumption. In this work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a flexible
copula dependence model to capture complex dependencies. A hierarchical
Bayesian multimodel approach is proposed to quantify uncertainty in dependence
model-form and model parameters that result from small data sets. This approach
begins by identifying, through Bayesian multimodel inference, a set of
candidate marginal models and their corresponding model probabilities, and then
estimating the uncertainty in the copula-based dependence structure, which is
conditional on the marginals and their parameters. The overall uncertainties
integrating marginals and copulas are probabilistically represented by an
ensemble of multivariate candidate densities. A novel importance sampling
reweighting approach is proposed to efficiently propagate the overall
uncertainties through a computational model. Through an example studying the
influence of constituent properties on the out-of-plane properties of
transversely isotropic E- glass fiber composites, we show that the composite
property with copula-based dependence model converges to the true estimate as
data set size increases, while an independence or arbitrary Gaussian
correlation assumption leads to a biased estimate.

We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope

mostly large masses ($1.3-2.0$ M$_\odot$). BHs in merging BHNSs are
preferentially low mass ($5-15$ M$_\odot$). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly
depend on the progenitor's metallicity and span from $\sim{}5$ to $\sim{}45$

fields in the past few years due to their remarkable performance on
recognition/classification tasks surpassing the state-of-the art. One of the
keys to their success lies in the richness of the automatically learned
features. In order to get very good accuracy, one popular option is to increase
the depth of the network. Training such a deep network is however infeasible or
impractical with moderate computational resources and budget. The other
alternative to increase the performance is to learn multiple weak classifiers
and boost their performance using a boosting algorithm or a variant thereof.
But, one of the problems with boosting algorithms is that they require a
re-training of the networks based on the misclassified samples. Motivated by
these problems, in this work we propose an aggregation technique which combines
the output of multiple weak classifiers. We formulate the aggregation problem
using a mixture model fitted to the trained classifier outputs. Our model does
not require any re-training of the `weak' networks and is computationally very
fast (takes $<30$ seconds to run in our experiments). Thus, using a less
expensive training stage and without doing any re-training of networks, we
experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to boost the performance by
$12\%$. Furthermore, we present experiments using hand-crafted features and
improved the classification performance using the proposed aggregation
technique. One of the major advantages of our framework is that our framework
allows one to combine features that are very likely to be of distinct
dimensions since they are extracted using different networks/algorithms. Our
experimental results demonstrate a significant performance gain from the use of
our aggregation technique at a very small computational cost.

obtained from the edge detection process, the aim of ellipse fitting is to
construct an elliptic equation that best fits the collected observations.
However, some of the scattering points may contain outliers due to imperfect
edge detection. To address this issue, we devise a robust real-time ellipse
fitting approach based on two kinds of analog neural network, Lagrange
programming neural network (LPNN) and locally competitive algorithm (LCA).
First, to alleviate the influence of these outliers, the fitting task is
formulated as a nonsmooth constrained optimization problem in which the
objective function is either an l1-norm or l0-norm term. It is because compared
with the l2-norm in some traditional ellipse fitting models, the lp-norm with
p<2 is less sensitive to outliers. Then, to calculate a real-time solution of
this optimization problem, LPNN is applied. As the LPNN model cannot handle the
non-differentiable term in its objective, the concept of LCA is introduced and
combined with the LPNN framework. Simulation and experimental results show that
the proposed ellipse fitting approach is superior to several state-of-the-art
algorithms.

(DDF-ROM) framework for the numerical simulation of fluid flows, which can be
formally written as \begin{equation*}
  \boxed{
  \text{
  DDF-ROM = Galerkin-ROM + Correction

filtering and data-driven ROM closure modeling (for the Correction term) and
was successfully tested in the numerical simulation of a 2D channel flow past a
circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=100, Re=500$ and $Re=1000$.
  In this paper, we propose a {\it physically-constrained} DDF-ROM (CDDF-ROM),
which aims at improving the physical accuracy of the DDF-ROM. The new physical
constraints require that the CDDF-ROM operators satisfy the same type of
physical laws (i.e., the nonlinear operator should conserve energy and the ROM
closure term should be dissipative) as those satisfied by the fluid flow
equations. To implement these physical constraints, in the data-driven modeling
step of the DDF-ROM, we replace the unconstrained least squares problem with a
constrained least squares problem. We perform a numerical investigation of the
new CDDF-ROM and standard DDF-ROM for a 2D channel flow past a circular
cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=100, Re=500$ and $Re=1000$. To this end, we
consider a reproductive regime as well as a predictive (i.e., cross-validation)
regime in which we use as little as $50\%$ of the original training data. The
numerical investigation clearly shows that the new CDDF-ROM is significantly
more accurate than the DDF-ROM in both regimes.

belief networks, being representations of joint probability distribution with
an underlying directed acyclic graph structure, are paid special attention due
to the fact that efficient reasoning (uncertainty propagation) methods have
been developed for belief network structures. Algorithms have been therefore
developed to acquire the belief network structure from data. As artifacts due
to variable hiding negatively influence the performance of derived belief

developed.
  Regrettably, some of them are known already to be erroneous (e.g. IC

uniform stability, and design stable disretizations and parameter-robust
preconditioners for flux-based formulations of multiple-network poroelastic

establishing uniform inf-sup stability of the continuous problem are
introduced. As a result, the stability estimates presented here are uniform not
only with respect to the Lam\'e parameter $\lambda$, but also with respect to
all the other model parameters such as permeability coefficients $K_i$, storage
coefficients $c_{p_i}$, network transfer coefficients $\beta_{ij},
i,j=1,\cdots,n$, the scale of the networks $n$ and the time step size $\tau$.
  Moreover, strongly mass conservative discretizations that meet the required
conditions for parameter-robust stability are suggested and corresponding
optimal error estimates proved. The transfer of the canonical (norm-equivalent)
operator preconditioners from the continuous to the discrete level lays the
foundation for optimal and fully robust iterative solution methods. The
theoretical results are confirmed in numerical experiments that are motivated
by practical applications.

This facilitates path planning algorithms to choose the edges with least real

dependent on historical data which are close in time. But, there aresituations
when all the travel times for one or more edge(s) are not available for the

imperative for that robot to gather the necessary travel times from others

the solute molecules bind transiently with each other to form long-lived
complexes. The binding causes kinetic stabilization of inclusions of the
solute-rich phase---within a substantial size range---so as to render the
critical size for nucleation of the inclusions finite. Individual droplets
nucleate and grow until they become mechanically unstable because of a
concomitant drop in the internal pressure, the latter drop caused by the
thermodynamic metastability of the solute-rich phase. At the same time, the
{\em ensemble} of the droplets is steady-state on long times. In a freshly

contains the SU(3) symmetry. Therefore, the relativistic matter wave is
suitable for describing many-particle system such as quarks or gluons etc that
are engaged with implicated symmetry problems. The weak interaction and strong
interaction are investigated by using the relativistic de Broglie matter wave
with SU(n) symmetry. Our results agree well with experiments. This work is to
re-discover and re-explore de Broglie matter wave with the SU(n) symmetry and
its applications to particle physics. This work was divided into two parts:

captured using driver-specific speed-spacing relations, i.e., parametric
uncertainty. It also results in smooth vehicle trajectories in a stochastic
context, which is in agreement with real-world traffic dynamics and, thereby,
overcoming issues with aggressive oscillation typically observed in sample
paths of stochastic traffic flow models. We utilize ensemble filtering
techniques for data assimilation (traffic state estimation), but derive the
mean and covariance dynamics as the ensemble sizes go to infinity, thereby
bypassing the need to sample from the parameter distributions while estimating
the traffic states. As a result, the estimation algorithm is just a standard
Kalman-Bucy algorithm, which renders the proposed approach amenable to
real-time applications using recursive data. Data assimilation examples are
performed and our results indicate good agreement with out-of-sample data.

Most state-of-the-art tools perform symbolic computation as interpreters and

and in fact practical, to use a compiler-based strategy instead. Using compiler
tooling, we propose and implement a transformation which takes a standard
program and outputs a program that performs semantically equivalent, but
partially symbolic, computation. The transformed program maintains symbolic
values internally and operates directly on them hence the program can be
processed by a tool without support for symbolic manipulation.
  The main motivation for the transformation is in symbolic verification, but
there are many other possible use-cases, including test generation and concolic
testing. Moreover using the transformation simplifies tools, since the symbolic
computation is handled by the program directly. We have implemented the
transformation at the level of LLVM bitcode. The paper includes an experimental

high-voltage structures with p-n-junctions (VPSS) operating in a high-frequency
mode were theoretically studied for the first time. It is shown that strong
temperature dependence of the control radiation absorption coefficient $k(T)$
is the main factor determining the maximum switching frequency $f_{max}$ and
the corresponding maximum crystal temperature $T_{max}$, as well as
distributions of temperature $T$ and current density $j$ over a device area. A
two-dimensional analysis of the simplest electrothermal model of VPSS embedded
into a double coaxial forming line showed that an increase in the switching
frequency $f$ leads to displacement of current to device periphery, where the
temperature is minimal. However, distributions of $T$ and $j$ over the device
area remain stable if $f < f_{max}$ and $T < T_{max}$. Of course, the values
$f_{max}$ and $T_{max}$ depend on the energy of control radiation pulses, pulse
switching power and heat sink conditions. For VPSS based on nondirect-gap
semiconductors (Si, SiC), they varies within 20-120 kHz and 120-160 $^o C$,
quite sufficient for practical application. However, VPSS based on direct-gap
semiconductors (GaAs, InP) are not actually suitable for operation in
high-frequency modes due to too sharp dependence $k(T)$.

  combustion engine vehicles: the influence of driving range and battery
  technology",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CY q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are now clearly a promising candidate in
addressing the environmental problems associated with conventional internal
combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). However, BEVs, unlike ICEVs, are still not
widely accepted in the automobile market but continuing technological change
could overcome this barrier. The aim of this study is to assess and forecast
whether and when design changes and technological improvements related to major
challenges in driving range and battery cost will make the user value of BEVs
greater than the user value of ICEVs. Specifically, we estimate the relative
user value of BEVs and ICEVs resulting after design modifications to achieve
different driving ranges by considering the engineering trade-offs based on a
vehicle simulation. Then, we analyze when the relative user value of BEVs is
expected to exceed ICEVs as the energy density and cost of batteries improve
because of ongoing technological change. Our analysis demonstrates that the
relative value of BEVs is lower than that of ICEVs because BEVs have high
battery cost and high cost of time spent recharging despite high torque, high
fuel efficiency, and low fuel cost. Moreover, we found the relative value
differences between BEVs and ICEVs are found to be less in high performance
large cars than in low performance compact cars because BEVs can achieve high
acceleration performance more easily than ICEVs. In addition, this study
predicts that in approximately 2050, high performance large BEVs could have
higher relative value than high performance large ICEVs because of
technological improvements in batteries; however low performance compact BEVs
are still very likely to have significantly lower user value than comparable
ICEVs until well beyond 2050.

propose to use textural cross-correlation to characterise apparent feature
motion in a single light field, and compare this motion to its Lambertian
equivalent based on 4D light field geometry. Our refracted feature
distinguisher has a 34.3% higher rate of detection compared to state-of-the-art
for light fields captured with large baselines relative to the refractive
object. Our method also applies to light field cameras with much smaller
baselines than previously considered, yielding up to 2 times better detection
for 2D-refractive objects, such as a sphere, and up to 8 times better for
1D-refractive objects, such as a cylinder. For structure from motion, we
demonstrate that rejecting refracted features using our distinguisher yields up
to 42.4% lower reprojection error, and lower failure rate when the robot is
approaching refractive objects. Our method lead to more robust robot vision in
the presence of refractive objects.

achieve substantially better sample efficiency and transfer behavior, allowing
an agent trained on the source task to transfer well to the target tasks. The
