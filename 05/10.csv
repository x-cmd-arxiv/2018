phenomenologically account for quantum gravity effects, independently of the
considered theory of quantum gravity. We show that quantum fluids enable
experimental analogs and direct tests of the modified uncertainty principle
expected to be valid at the Planck scale. We consider a quantum clock realized
by a long-lasting quantum fluid wave-packet orbiting in a trapping potential.
We investigate the hydrodynamics of the Schr\""odinger equation encompassing
kinetic terms due to Planck-scale effects. We study the resulting generalized
mechanics and validate the predictions by quantum simulations. Wave-packet
orbiting generates a continuous amplification of the quantum gravity effects.
The non-commutative variables in the phase-space produce a precession and an
acceleration of the orbital motion. The precession of the orbit is strongly
resembling the famous orbital precession of the perihelion of Mercury used by
Einstein to validate the corrections of general relativity to Newton's theory.
In our case, the corrections are due to the modified uncertainty principle. The
results can be employed to emulate quantum gravity in the laboratory, or to
realize human-scale experiments to determine bounds for the most studied
quantum-gravity models and probe Planckian physics.

In the uniform case, mean field theory is well defined by averaging over the
network as the number of neurons in the network goes to infinity. However, for
nonuniform coupling it is no longer possible to average over the entire network
if we are interested in fluctuations at a particular location within the

be defined such that mean field theory is well defined for a spatially

in a sample of post-merger galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). Archival HI measurements of 47 targets are combined with new Arecibo
observations of a further 51 galaxies. The stellar mass range of the
post-merger sample, our observing strategy, detection thresholds and data
analysis procedures replicate those of the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey
(xGASS) which can therefore be used as a control sample. Our principal results
are: 1) The post-merger sample shows a ~50 per cent higher HI detection
fraction compared with xGASS; 2) Accounting for non-detections, the median
atomic gas fraction of the post-merger sample is larger than the control sample
by 0.3 -- 0.6 dex; 3) The median atomic gas fraction enhancement (delta fgas),
computed on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis at fixed stellar mass, is 0.51 dex. Our
results demonstrate that recently merged galaxies are typically a factor of ~3
more HI rich than control galaxies of the same M*. If the control sample is
additionally matched in star formation rate, the median HI excess is reduced to
delta fgas = 0.2 dex, showing that the enhanced atomic gas fractions in
post-mergers are not purely a reflection of changes in star formation activity.
We conclude that merger-induced starbursts and outflows do not lead to prompt
quenching via exhaustion/expulsion of the galactic gas reservoirs. Instead, we
propose that if star formation ceases after a merger, it is more likely due to
an enhanced turbulence which renders the galaxy unable to effectively form new
stars.

sections of a certain sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ of ""nearly rigid functions""

$\mathrm{Gal}(\mathcal{Y}/Y)$ by $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}^{\times}$-valued weight

on the Igusa tower $Y^{\mathrm{Ig}}$; indeed we may recover Katz's theory by
restricting to a natural $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$-covering
$\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{Ig}}$ of $Y^{\mathrm{Ig}}$, viewing
$\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{Ig}} \subset \mathcal{Y}$ as a sublocus. Our $p$-adic
Maass-Shimura operator sends $p$-adic modular forms of weight $k$ to forms of
weight $k + 2$. Its construction comes from a relative Hodge decomposition with
coefficients in $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ defined using Hodge-Tate and Hodge-de
Rham periods arising from Scholze's Hodge-Tate period map and the relative
$p$-adic de Rham comparison theorem. By studying the effect of powers of the

how the envelope ejects and a tight binary results, if only the binary

Accretion is likely common in post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) binary

star-forming galaxies presents a tight correlation with the rest-frame (g - i)
colour up to z = 1.5. Such MLCR is linear for quiescent galaxies and quadratic
for star-forming galaxies. The intrinsic dispersion in these relations is 0.02
dex for quiescent galaxies and 0.06 dex for star-forming ones. The derived
MLCRs do not present a significant redshift evolution and are compatible with
previous local results in the literature. Finally, these tight relations also
hold for g- and r-band luminosities. The derived MLCRs in ALHAMBRA can be used
to predict the mass-to-light ratio from a rest-frame optical colour up to z =

In active galactic nuclei (AGN), the kinetic energy flux of the jet may exceed
the bolometric luminosity of the disk a few orders of magnitude. This phenomena
can be explained in frameworks of so called ""cold"" disk accretion when the only
source of energy of AGN is the energy released at the accretion. The radiation
from the disk is suppressed because the wind from the disk carries out almost
all the angular momentum and the gravitational energy of the accreted material.
In this paper, we calculate an unavoidable radiation from the ""cold"" disk and
the ratio of the kinetic energy luminosity of the outflow to the bolometric
luminosity of the accretion disk around a super massive black hole in framework
of the paradigm of the optically thick alpha-disk of Shakura \& Sunyaev. The
ratio of the luminosities is defined predominantly by the ratio of the magnetic
field pressure inside the disk to the magnetic field pressure at the base of
the wind. The obtained equations applied to the jet of M87 demonstrate good
agreement with observations. In the case of Sgr A*, these equations allow us to
predict the kinetic energy flux from the disk around Galactic SMBH.

various iridate materials focusing on core-level excitations and transitions
between crystal-field split d-levels. The 2p core hole created at the Ir $L_3$
absorption edge has a very short lifetime giving rise to a broad absorption
width ($\sim 5$~eV). This absorption linewidth broadening can be overcome by
studying the resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) map, which is a
two-dimensional intensity map of the Ir L$\alpha_2$ emission obtained with high
energy-resolution monochromator and analyzer. By limiting the emitted photon
energy to a narrow range, one can obtain x-ray absorption spectra in the high
energy-resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode, while one can also
simulate quasi-$M_4$-edge absorption spectra by integrating over incident
photon energies. Both methods improve the absorption line width significantly,
allowing detailed studies of unoccupied electronic structure in iridates and
other $5d$ transition metal compounds. On the other hand, the short lifetime of
the 2p core hole benefits the study of excitations of valence electrons. We
show that the incident energy dependence of the RIXS spectra for $d-d$
transitions is simple to understand due to the short core-hole lifetime, which
validates ultra-short core-hole lifetime approximation used widely in
theoretical calculations. We compared $d-d$ excitations in various iridates and
found that the excitations between the t$_{2g}$ and e$_g$ states share many
similarities among different materials. However, the RIXS spectra due to the
transitions between the spin-orbit-split t$_{2g}$ levels vary widely depending
on the oxidation state and electronic bandwidths.

supervision signal, whether a dictionary, translations, or comparable
corpora---seems impossible, but nevertheless, Lample et al. (2018) recently
proposed a fully unsupervised machine translation (MT) model. The model relies
heavily on an adversarial, unsupervised alignment of word embedding spaces for
bilingual dictionary induction (Conneau et al., 2018), which we examine here.
Our results identify the limitations of current unsupervised MT: unsupervised
bilingual dictionary induction performs much worse on morphologically rich
languages that are not dependent marking, when monolingual corpora from
different domains or different embedding algorithms are used. We show that a
simple trick, exploiting a weak supervision signal from identical words,
enables more robust induction, and establish a near-perfect correlation between
unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction performance and a previously
unexplored graph similarity metric.

demonstrate that a VCSEL operating in the regime of polarization switchings

detection of microvibrations. For small amplitudes of microvibrations (less
than $\lambda$/2, where $\lambda$ is the operating wavelength of the laser),
which cause only harmonic (or close to harmonic) oscillations in the laser
output outside of the bistability region, the use of polarization switching can
increase the responsivity up to 45 times. For the amplitudes larger then
$\lambda$/2 the response of a bistable VCSEL well reproduces a fine temporal
structure of the self-mixing signal. A procedure of the data processing in the
switching regime for the correct determination of the direction of the
displacement and for the reconstruction of the waveform of surface vibrations
with a basic resolution of $\lambda$/2 is also shown.

general parametrisations of modified gravity, in order to calculate the
corresponding power spectra, where additional parameters are the initial
condition of matter perturbations $\alpha$ and the scale-dependent modified
gravity parameter $Y$ (also known as $G_\mathrm{eff}$) that measures deviations
from GR in the Poisson equation. We show the impact of these model-independent
modifications of gravity, to either delay or expedite reionisation. For the
21cm intensity mapping survey to be performed by the SKA mission, we forecast
the ability of line intensity mapping to constrain the parameters $Y$ and
$\alpha$ at redshifts $z=6-11$, where $Y$ is assumed constant during this epoch
(but without requiring constancy at all times). In our most conservative
scenario, the $Y$ parameter can be constrained at the tens of percent level,
while for improved modelling of foregrounds as well as of the (mildly)
non-linear regime, up to sub-percent level constraints are attainable. We show
the impact of jointly estimating reionisation model parameters and
corresponding parameter correlations, as well as of foreground removal. We
note, that tomography is crucial to break degeneracies and for constraints not
to degrade significantly when adding reionisation model parameters, with most
constraining power coming from the redshift bins $z=7-10$ where the shape of
the 21cm power spectrum is evolving fastest.

intriguing phenomena in nature. It was first realized in quantum gases of
ultra-cold atoms, but more recently became accessible in open-dissipative,
exciton-based solid-state systems at elevated temperatures. Semiconducting
monolayer crystals have emerged as a new platform for studies of strongly bound
excitons in ultimately thin materials. Here, we demonstrate the formation of a
bosonic condensate driven by excitons hosted in an atomically thin layer of
MoSe2, strongly coupled to light in a solid-state resonator. The structure is
operated in the regime of collective strong coupling, giving rise to hybrid
exciton-polariton modes composed of a Tamm-plasmon resonance, GaAs quantum well
excitons and two-dimensional excitons confined in a monolayer of MoSe2.
Polariton condensation in a monolayer crystal manifests by a superlinear
increase of emission intensity from the hybrid polariton mode at injection
powers as low as 4.8 pJ/pulse, as well as its density-dependent blueshift and a
dramatic collapse of the emission linewidth as a hallmark of temporal
coherence. Importantly, we observe a significant spin-polarization in the
injected polariton condensate, a fingerprint of the core property of monolayer
excitons subject to spin-valley locking. The observed effects clearly underpin
the perspective of building novel highly non-linear valleytronic devices based
on light-matter fluids, coherent bosonic light sources based on atomically thin
materials, and paves the way towards studying materials with unconventional
topological properties in the framework of bosonic condensation.

perturbations arisen from a sound speed parameter with an oscillatory behavior,
which can generically lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the
early Universe. For a general inflaton field, it can seed primordial density
fluctuations and their propagation is governed by a parameter of sound speed
square. Once if this parameter achieves an oscillatory feature for a while
during inflation, a significant non-perturbative resonance effect on the
inflaton field fluctuations takes place around a critical length scale, which
results in significant peaks in the primordial power spectrum. By virtue of
this robust mechanism, primordial black holes with specific mass function can
be produced with a sufficient abundance for dark matter in sizable parameter
ranges.

$850~\mu m$ luminosity (L$_{\rm \nu,850}$) as a molecular gas mass (M$_{\rm

For our fiducial simulations, where we assume the dust mass is linearly related
to the metal mass, we find that empirical L$_{\rm \nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$
calibrations accurately recover the molecular gas mass of our model galaxies,
and that the L$_{\rm \nu,850}$-dependent calibration is preferred. We argue the
major driver of scatter in the L$_{\rm \nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$ relation arises
from variations in the molecular gas to dust mass ratio, rather than variations
in the dust temperature, in agreement with the previous study of Liang et al.
Emulating a realistic measurement strategy with ALMA observing bands that are
dependent on the source redshift, we find that estimating S$_{\rm \nu,850}$
from continuum emission at a different frequency contributes $10-20\%$ scatter
to the L$_{\rm \nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$ relation. This additional scatter arises
from a combination of mismatches in assumed T$_{dust}$ and $\beta$ values, as
well as the fact that the SEDs are not single-temperature blackbodies.Finally
we explore the impact of a dust prescription in which the dust-to-metals ratio
varies with metallicity. Though the resulting mean dust temperatures are
$\sim50\%$ higher, the dust mass is significantly decreased for low-metallicity
halos. As a result, the observationally calibrated L$_{\rm \nu,850}$-M$_{\rm
mol}$ relation holds for massive galaxies, independent of the dust model, but
below L$_{\rm \nu,850}\lesssim10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (metallicities
$\log_{10}({\rm Z}/{\rm Z}_{\odot})\lesssim -0.8$) we expect galaxies may
deviate from literature observational calibrations by $\gtrsim0.5$ dex.

hierarchical assembly in determining the properties of GC populations. Many
previous works have argued that the observed linear relation between total GC
mass and halo mass points to a fundamental GC -- dark matter connection or
indicates that GCs formed at very high redshift before feedback processes
introduced nonlinearity in the baryon-to-dark matter mass relation. We
demonstrate that at $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, a constant
ratio between halo mass and total GC mass is in fact an almost inevitable
consequence of hierarchical assembly: by the central limit theorem, it is
expected at $z=0$ independent of the GC-to-halo mass relation at the time of GC
formation. The GC-to-halo mass relation at $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) < 10^{11.5}
M_{\odot}$ is more sensitive to the details of the GC formation process. In our
fiducial model, GC formation occurs in galaxies when the gas surface density
exceeds a critical value. This model naturally predicts bimodal GC color
distributions similar to those observed in nearby galaxies and reproduces the
observed relation between GC system metallicity and halo mass. It predicts that
the cosmic GC formation rate peaked at $z$ $\sim$ 4, too late for GCs to
contribute significantly to the UV luminosity density during reionization.

known moving groups in the $(U,V)$-plane of the Solar neighborhood correspond
to overdensities in $(J_R,L_z)$, as expected. But $n(J_R,L_z)$ also exhibits a
wealth of density clumps and ridges that extend towards higher $J_R$. These

with a single parameter $\kappa$. Large values of $\kappa$ imply that $\psi$ is
distributed narrowly around zero, while small values imply approximate
isotropy. Our findings are: (1) The distribution of $\psi$ in Kepler systems is
narrower than found by previous studies and consistent with $\kappa\sim15$
(mean $\langle\psi\rangle\sim19^\circ$ and spread $\psi\sim10^\circ$). (2) The
value of $\kappa$ in Kepler systems does not depend, at a statistically
significant level, on planet multiplicity, stellar multiplicity or stellar age;
on the other hand, metal-rich hosts, small planet hosts and long-period planet
hosts tend to be more oblique than the general sample (at a $\sim$2.5-$\sigma$
significance level). (3) Hot Jupiter (HJ) systems with RM measurements are
consistent with $\kappa\sim2$, more broadly distributed than the general Kepler
population. (4) A separation of the RM sample into cooler ($T_{\rm
eff}\lesssim$6250 K) and hotter ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim$6250 K) HJ hosts results
in two distinct distributions, $\kappa_{\rm cooler}\sim4$ and $\kappa_{\rm
hotter}\sim1$ (4-$\sigma$ significance), both more oblique than the Kepler
sample. We hypothesize that the total mass in planets may be behind the
increasing obliquity with metallicity and planet radius, and that the period
dependence could be due to primordial disk alignment rather than realignment of
stellar spin.

circuits as oracles within the recently introduced ""qubitization"" framework,
one can use quantum phase estimation to sample states in the Hamiltonian
eigenbasis with optimal query complexity $O(\lambda / \epsilon)$ where
$\lambda$ is an absolute sum of Hamiltonian coefficients and $\epsilon$ is
target precision. For both the Hubbard model and electronic structure
Hamiltonian in a second quantized basis diagonalizing the Coulomb operator, our
circuits have T gate complexity $O({N + \log (1/\epsilon}))$ where $N$ is
number of orbitals in the basis. This enables sampling in the eigenbasis of
electronic structure Hamiltonians with T complexity $O(N^3 /\epsilon + N^2
\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)$. Compared to prior approaches, our algorithms are
asymptotically more efficient in gate complexity and require fewer T gates near
the classically intractable regime. Compiling to surface code fault-tolerant
gates and assuming per gate error rates of one part in a thousand reveals that
one can error correct phase estimation on interesting instances of these
problems beyond the current capabilities of classical methods using only about
a million superconducting qubits in a matter of hours.

challenge both in Condensed Matter physics and in Lattice Gauge Theory. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a chiral free-fermion theory can live on an
ultra-local spacetime lattice if we allow the Lagrangian to be non-hermitian.
Rather than a violation of unitarity, the non-hermitian structure of our
Lagrangian arises because time is discrete, and we show that our model is obeys
an elementary unitarity condition: namely, that the norm of the two-point
functions conserves probability. Beyond unitarity, our model displays several
surprising properties: it is formulated directly in Minkowskian time; it has
exactly Lorentz invariant dynamics for all frequencies and momenta (in the
large volume limit); and it is free from all gauge anomalies, despite the
prediction from field theory that it should suffer one. We show that our model
is a discrete time description of a single chiral edge mode of several recently
proposed $2+1$d Floquet models. That the chiral edge can be treated without the
rest of the $2+1$d system, even when coupled to a gauge field, implies that the
Floquet models are radically different from Integer Quantum Hall models, which
also support chiral edge modes. Furthermore, the Floquet results imply that our
model can be physically realized, which presents an opportunity for gauge
theories to be simulated in a condensed matter or cold atom context. Our
results present a solution to the `Chiral-fermion problem:' a chiral field
theory can indeed be defined on an ultra-local spacetime lattice, and we
address how our model avoids several no-go arguments.

nuclei) observed with ALMA at high-spatial resolution (~500 pc). We detect
massive cold molecular gas outflows in 5 out of 6 nuclei (0.3-5)x10^8 Msun.
These outflows are spatially resolved with deprojected radii of 0.25-1 kpc
although high-velocity molecular gas is detected up to ~0.5-1.8 kpc (1-6 kpc
deprojected). The mass outflow rates are 12-400 Msun/yr and the inclination
corrected average velocity of the outflowing gas 350-550 km/s (v_max = 500-900
km/s). The origin of these outflows can be explained by the nuclear starbursts
although the contribution of an obscured AGN can not be completely ruled out.
The position angle (PA) of the outflowing gas along the kinematic minor axis of
the nuclear molecular disk suggests that the outflow axis is perpendicular to
the disk for three of these outflows. Only in one case, the outflow PA is
clearly not along the kinematic minor axis. The outflow depletion times are
15-80 Myr which are slightly shorter than the star-formation (SF) depletion
times (30-80 Myr). However, we estimate that only 15-30% of the outflowing gas
will escape the gravitational potential of the nucleus. The majority of the
outflowing gas will return to the disk after 5-10 Myr and become available to
form new stars. Therefore, these outflows will not likely quench the nuclear
starbursts. These outflows would be consistent with being driven by radiation
pressure (momentum-driven) only if the coupling between radiation and dust
increases with increasing SF rates. This can be achieved if the dust optical
depth is higher in objects with higher SF. The relatively small sizes (<1 kpc)
and dynamical times (<3 Myr) of the cold molecular outflows suggests that
molecular gas cannot survive longer in the outflow environment or that it
cannot form efficiently beyond these distances or times. (Abridged)

We identify 9 dense and gravitationally bound cores in the whole cloud

advantage of this opportunity. JWST, although delayed, will still complete its
nominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification,
confirmation, and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization
targets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future dedicated missions for atmospheric
studies such as ARIEL require the discovery and confirmation of several hundred
additional sub-Jovian size planets (R_p < 10 R_Earth) orbiting bright stars,
beyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of
exoplanet atmospheres. Ground-based ELTs will also contribute to surveying the
atmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set
of two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected
signal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given
planet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be
readily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our
proposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid
follow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based on the
catalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al. (2015), we determine
appropriate cutoff values of the metrics, such that the TESS mission will

weighted least squares and the maximum likelihood. Novel technical results are
presented to determine the performance of an estimator that corresponds to the
solution of an optimization problem in the context of astrometry. Using these
results we are able to place stringent bounds on the bias and the variance of
the estimators in close form as a function of the data. We confirm these
results through comparisons to numerical simulations under a broad range of
realistic observing conditions. The maximum likelihood and the weighted least
square estimators are analyzed. We confirm the sub-optimality of the weighted
least squares scheme from medium to high signal-to-noise found in an earlier
study for the (unweighted) least squares method. We find that the maximum
likelihood estimator achieves optimal performance limits across a wide range of
relevant observational conditions. Furthermore, from our results, we provide
concrete insights for adopting an adaptive weighted least square estimator that
can be regarded as a computationally efficient alternative to the optimal
maximum likelihood solution. We provide, for the first time, close-form
analytical expressions that bound the bias and the variance of the weighted
least square and maximum likelihood implicit estimators for astrometry using a

Dataset Nutrition Label (the Label) is a diagnostic framework that lowers the
barrier to standardized data analysis by providing a distilled yet
comprehensive overview of dataset ""ingredients"" before AI model development.
Building a Label that can be applied across domains and data types requires
that the framework itself be flexible and adaptable; as such, the Label is
comprised of diverse qualitative and quantitative modules generated through
multiple statistical and probabilistic modelling backends, but displayed in a
standardized format. To demonstrate and advance this concept, we generated and
published an open source prototype with seven sample modules on the ProPublica
Dollars for Docs dataset. The benefits of the Label are manyfold. For data
specialists, the Label will drive more robust data analysis practices, provide
an efficient way to select the best dataset for their purposes, and increase
the overall quality of AI models as a result of more robust training datasets
and the ability to check for issues at the time of model development. For those
building and publishing datasets, the Label creates an expectation of
explanation, which will drive better data collection practices. We also explore
the limitations of the Label, including the challenges of generalizing across
diverse datasets, and the risk of using ""ground truth"" data as a comparison
dataset. We discuss ways to move forward given the limitations identified.
Lastly, we lay out future directions for the Dataset Nutrition Label project,
including research and public policy agendas to further advance consideration
of the concept.

leading eigenvalues of the gangs' conflict adjacency matrix, which serves a
proxy for unstable self-excitation from revenge attacks. The distribution of
links based on the geographic distance between gangs in confrontation leads to
the confirmation that territorial control is a main catalyst of violence and
retaliation among gangs. Additionally, the Boltzmann-Lotka-Volterra (BLV)
dynamic interaction network analysis is applied to quantify the spatial
embeddedness of the dynamic relationship between conflicting gangs in Medellin,

The new method circumvents the use of bounces in Euclidean space by introducing
an auxiliary function, a tunneling potential $V_t$ that connects smoothly the
metastable and stable phases of the field potential $V$. The tunneling action
is obtained as the integral in field space of an action density that is a
simple function of $V_t$ and $V$. This compact expression can be considered as

specified by two pieces of input: (i) a mathematical program (an objective
function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and a feasible set
$\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$), and (ii) a dynamical system (a map
$g:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$). Its goal is to minimize $f$ over the
set $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\Omega$ of initial conditions that forever remain in
$\Omega$ under $g$. The focus of this paper is on the case where the
mathematical program is a linear program and the dynamical system is either a
known linear map, or an uncertain linear map that can change over time. In both
cases, we study a converging sequence of polyhedral outer approximations and
(lifted) spectrahedral inner approximations to $\mathcal{S}$. Our inner
approximations are optimized with respect to the objective function $f$ and
their semidefinite characterization---which has a semidefinite constraint of
fixed size---is obtained by applying polar duality to convex sets that are
invariant under (multiple) linear maps. We characterize three barriers that can
stop convergence of the outer approximations from being finite. We prove that
once these barriers are removed, our inner and outer approximating procedures
find an optimal solution and a certificate of optimality for the RDO problem in
a finite number of steps. Moreover, in the case where the dynamics are linear,
we show that this phenomenon occurs in a number of steps that can be computed
in time polynomial in the bit size of the input data. Our analysis also leads
to a polynomial-time algorithm for RDO instances where the spectral radius of
the linear map is bounded above by any constant less than one. Finally, in our
concluding section, we propose a broader research agenda for studying
optimization problems with dynamical systems constraints, of which RDO is a
special case.

energy electrons undergo radiative losses effectively. The change in the energy
index should then be approximately 1 and corresponds to a spectral index
difference of 0.5. However, one of the long outstanding problems has been that
the observed index change is significantly different. On the other hand, recent
high quality observations of blazars suggest that their local spectra may not
be a power-law, instead have a slight curvature and often represented by a log
parabola model. Using XMM-Newton observations spanning over 12 years for the BL
Lac PKS 2155-304, we show that the optical/UV and X-ray spectra can be well
represented by a broken log parabola model. Further, we show that such a

observed difference in the photon spectral indices, also tries to explain the

improve our understanding of stellar physics that has, so far, been performed

characterization of the evolutionary status for a large number of red giants
allows us to study the physical processes acting in the interior of red giants
and how they are modify during stellar evolution. In this work, we aim to
obtain information on the excitation and damping of pressure modes through the
measurement of the stars' pressure mode widths and amplitudes and to analyze
how they are modified with stellar evolution. The objective is to bring
observational constraints on the modeling of the physical processes behind mode
excitation and damping. Methods: we fit the frequency spectra of red giants
with well defined evolutionary status using Lorentzians functions to derive the
pressure mode widths and amplitudes. To strengthen our conclusions, we used two
different fitting techniques. Results: pressure mode widths and amplitudes were
determined for more than 5000 red giants. With a stellar sample two orders of
magnitude larger than previous results, we confirmed that the mode width
depends on stellar evolution and varies with stellar effective temperature. In
addition, we discovered that the mode width depends on stellar mass. We also
confirmed observationally the influence of the stellar metallicity on the mode
amplitudes, as predicted by models.

of social insects, which perform task allocation in a setting of limited
capabilities and noisy environment feedback. We assume that each task has a
demand that should be satisfied but not exceeded, i.e., there is an optimal
number of ants that should be working on this task at a given time. The goal is
to assign a near-optimal number of workers to each task in a distributed manner
and without explicit access to the values of the demands nor the number of ants
working on the task.
  We seek to answer the question of how the quality of task allocation depends
on the accuracy of assessing whether too many (overload) or not enough (lack)
ants are currently working on a given task. Concretely, we address the open
question of solving task allocation in the model where each ant receives
feedback that depends on the deficit defined as the (possibly negative)
difference between the optimal demand and the current number of workers in the
task. The feedback is modeled as a random variable that takes value lack or
overload with probability given by a sigmoid of the deficit. Each ants receives
the feedback independently, but the higher the overload or lack of workers for
a task, the more likely it is that all the ants will receive the same, correct
feedback from this task; the closer the deficit is to zero, the less reliable
the feedback becomes. We measure the performance of task allocation algorithms
using the notion of regret, defined as the absolute value of the deficit summed
over all tasks and summed over time.
  We propose a simple, constant-memory, self-stabilizing, distributed algorithm
that quickly converges from any initial distribution to a near-optimal
assignment. We also show that our algorithm works not only under stochastic
noise but also in an adversarial noise setting.

becomes crucial to explore new conduction paths. Recent studies indicate that
doping with chloride increases the ion conductivity of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$,
although to a much lesser extent than expected if chloride is assumed as a
donor dopant [Gerbig et al., Adv. Mater.,2013, 25, 3129]. Subsequently, it has
been shown that the addition of lithium chloride, LiCl, to the battery
electrolyte increases its discharge capacity while this effect is not observed
with other halogens [Matsuda et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2016, 120, 13360]. This
fact was attributed to an increase in the conductivity of Cl-doped
Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$, but still the responsible mechanism is not clear. In this
work, we have performed first principle calculations to study the effect of the
different halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) as substitutional defects in the electronic
and transport properties of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$. We have calculated the formation
energies of the different defects and impurities and we analysed how they
affect the activation barriers and diffusion coefficients . We have
demonstrated that the chloride does not behave like a donor dopant, thus
explaining the meager increase of the ionic conductivity experimentally
observed neither it promotes the polaron formation and its mobility. We have
also found that chloride does not present any special behaviour among the
halogen series. Our results reveal that all the studied configurations
associated with the halogen defects do not derive in metallic states nor extra
polarons that would increase considerably the electronic conductivity. This is
mainly due to the ionic characteristics of the Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ crystal and the
capability of the oxygen dimers to adapt its valence rather than to the nature
of the dopant itself.

entanglement of the two paths of the particle with two orthogonal states of the

interpreted as arising from random momentum kicks of magnitude $h/2d$ received
by the particle, $d$ being the slit separation. The same scenario is shown to
hold for a three-slit interference experiment. The random momentum kicks for
the three-slit case are of two kinds, of magnitude $\pm h/3d$. The analysis is
also generalized to the case of n-slit interference. The two alternate views

step towards computer-assisted diagnosis. In this work, we propose a tumor
segmentation framework based on the novel concept of persistent homology
profiles (PHPs). For a given image patch, the homology profiles are derived by
efficient computation of persistent homology, which is an algebraic tool from
homology theory. We propose an efficient way of computing topological
persistence of an image, alternative to simplicial homology. The PHPs are
devised to distinguish tumor regions from their normal counterparts by modeling
the atypical characteristics of tumor nuclei. We propose two variants of our
method for tumor segmentation: one that targets speed without compromising
accuracy and the other that targets higher accuracy. The fast version is based
on the selection of exemplar image patches from a convolution neural network
(CNN) and patch classification by quantifying the divergence between the PHPs
of exemplars and the input image patch. Detailed comparative evaluation shows
that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than competing algorithms
while achieving comparable results. The accurate version combines the PHPs and
high-level CNN features and employs a multi-stage ensemble strategy for image
patch labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of PHPs
and CNN features outperforms competing algorithms. This study is performed on
two independently collected colorectal datasets containing adenoma,
adenocarcinoma, signet and healthy cases. Collectively, the accurate tumor
segmentation produces the highest average patch-level F1-score, as compared
with competing algorithms, on malignant and healthy cases from both the

determine a range of ""critical"" bus voltage variances, the presented methods
monitor raw statistical data in an observable load pocket to determine when
control actions are needed to mitigate the risk of voltage collapse. A simple
reactive power controller is then implemented, which acts dynamically to
maintain an acceptable voltage stability margin within the system. Time domain
simulations on 3-bus and 39-bus test cases demonstrate that the resulting

stringent tradeoff between the matching-bandwidth and efficiency; implying

revoking the time-invariance assumption underlying the Bode-Fano criterion.
Using this scheme we show theoretically that an efficient wideband matching,

As the density gradient steepens, the axial and azimuthal Reynolds stresses
increase and radially sheared azimuthal and axial mean flows develop. A
turbulent axial momentum balance analysis shows that the axial Reynolds stress
drives the radially sheared axial mean flow. The turbulent drive (Reynolds
power) for the azimuthal flow is an order of magnitude greater than that for
axial flow, suggesting that the turbulence fluctuation levels are set by
azimuthal flow shear regulation. The direct energy exchange between axial and
azimuthal mean flows is shown to be insignificant. Therefore, the axial flow is
parasitic to the turbulence-zonal flow system and is driven primarily by the
axial turbulent stress generated by that system. The non-diffusive, residual
part of the axial Reynolds stress is found to be proportional to the density
gradient and is formed due to dynamical asymmetry in the drift-wave turbulence.

substructure from the disruption of a dwarf galaxy or a distant extension of
the Galactic disk. We test these hypotheses using chemical abundances of a
dozen TriAnd members from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's 14th Data Release of
Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) data to compare
to APOGEE abundances of stars with similar metallicity from both the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph, and the outer MW disk. We find that TriAnd stars are
chemically distinct from Sgr across a variety of elements, (C+N), Mg, K, Ca,
Mn, and Ni, with a separation in [X/Fe] of about 0.1 to 0.4 dex depending on
the element. Instead, the TriAnd stars, with a median metallicity of about
-0.8, exhibit chemical abundance ratios similar to those of the lowest
metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -0.7) stars in the outer Galactic disk, and are
consistent with expectations of extrapolated chemical gradients in the outer
disk of the MW. These results suggest that TriAnd is associated with the MW
disk, and, therefore, that the disk extends to this overdensity --- i.e., past
a Galactocentric radius of 24 kpc --- albeit vertically perturbed about 7 kpc

exploration of such data in VR/AR settings, has seen tremendous progress in

systems, however, comes with significant technical challenges. All approaches
proposed so far are extremely demanding on input and output devices, compute
resources and transmission bandwidth, and they do not reach the level of
immediacy required for applications such as remote collaboration. Here, we
introduce what we believe is the first practical client-server system for
real-time capture and many-user exploration of static 3D scenes. Our system is
based on the observation that interactive frame rates are sufficient for
capturing and reconstruction, and real-time performance is only required on the
client site to achieve lag-free view updates when rendering the 3D model.
Starting from this insight, we extend previous voxel block hashing frameworks
by overcoming internal dependencies and introducing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first thread-safe GPU hash map data structure that is robust
under massively concurrent retrieval, insertion and removal of entries on a
thread level. We further propose a novel transmission scheme for volume data
that is specifically targeted to Marching Cubes geometry reconstruction and
enables a 90% reduction in bandwidth between server and exploration clients.
The resulting system poses very moderate requirements on network bandwidth,
latency and client-side computation, which enables it to rely entirely on
consumer-grade hardware, including mobile devices. We demonstrate that our
technique achieves state-of-the-art representation accuracy while providing,
for any number of clients, an immersive and fluid lag-free viewing experience

computational cost of our estimator is only $2\cdotp$Lasso$(n,p)$, where
Lasso$(n,p)$ represents the computational burden of one Lasso optimization in a
model of size $(n,p)$. In comparison, existing grid search based approaches to
this problem require a computational cost of at least $n\cdot {\rm Lasso}(n,p)$
optimizations. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be able to
consistently detect the case of `no change', i.e., where no finite change point
exists in the model. We work under a subgaussian random design where the
underlying assumptions in our study are milder than those currently assumed in
the high dimensional change point regression literature. We allow the true
change point parameter $\tau_0$ to possibly move to the boundaries of its
parametric space, and the jump size $\|\beta_0-\gamma_0\|_2$ to possibly
diverge as $n$ increases. We then characterize the corresponding effects on the
rates of convergence of the change point and regression estimates. In
particular, we show that, while an increasing jump size may have a beneficial
effect on the change point estimate, however the optimal rate of regression
parameter estimates are preserved only upto a certain rate of the increasing
jump size. This behavior in the rate of regression parameter estimates is
unique to high dimensional change point regression models only. Simulations are
performed to empirically evaluate performance of the proposed estimators. The
methodology is applied to community level socio-economic data of the U.S.,

and hardest to provide primitives in distributed shared memory emulations. To
ensure survivability, scalability, and availability of a storage service in the
presence of failures, traditional approaches for atomic memory emulation, in
message passing environments, replicate the objects across multiple servers.
Compared to replication based algorithms, erasure code-based atomic memory
algorithms has much lower storage and communication costs, but usually, they
are harder to design. The difficulty of designing atomic memory algorithms
further grows, when the set of servers may be changed to ensure survivability
of the service over software and hardware upgrades, while avoiding service
interruptions. Atomic memory algorithms for performing server reconfiguration,
in the replicated systems, are very few, complex, and are still part of an
active area of research; reconfigurations of erasure-code based algorithms are
non-existent.
  In this work, we present ARES, an algorithmic framework that allows
reconfiguration of the underlying servers, and is particularly suitable for
erasure-code based algorithms emulating atomic objects. ARES introduces new
configurations while keeping the service available. To use with ARES we also
propose a new, and to our knowledge, the first two-round erasure code based
algorithm TREAS, for emulating multi-writer, multi-reader (MWMR) atomic objects
in asynchronous, message-passing environments, with near-optimal communication
and storage costs. Our algorithms can tolerate crash failures of any client and
some fraction of servers, and yet, guarantee safety and liveness property.
Moreover, by bringing together the advantages of ARES and TREAS, we propose an
optimized algorithm where new configurations can be installed without the
objects values passing through the reconfiguration clients.

on replacing an asymptotic plane by the two--sheeted ``hourglass"" shaped
surface obtained by joining smoothly an incoming hyperboloid with an outgoing
one. The hyperboloids have a fixed radius, and as one moves the center of the
hourglass along the time axis one covers the whole of spacetime. The motivation

technique works by lower bounding the entropy of the descriptions observed by
the terminal conditioned on the function value and by utilizing the
Schur-concave property of the entropy function. We evaluate these bounds for

signature is not automatically guaranteed. We identify, via the notion of
presentation of a signature, a large class of signatures that do generate a

  Our (presentable) signatures subsume classical algebraic signatures (i.e.,
signatures for languages with variable binding, such as the pure lambda
calculus) and extend them to include several other significant examples of
syntactic constructions.
  One key feature of our notions of signature, syntax, and presentation is that
they are highly compositional, in the sense that complex examples can be
obtained by gluing simpler ones. Moreover, through the Initial Semantics
approach, our framework provides, beyond the desired algebra of terms, a

consists of $n$ copies of small matrices $A$, $B$, and $D$, and one copy of
$C$, in a specific block structure. All existing algorithms along this line of
research follows an iterative augmentation framework, which relies on the
so-called Graver basis of the constraint matrix that constitutes a set of
fundamental augmenting steps. Bounding the $\ell_1$- or $\ell_\infty$-norm of
elements of the Graver basis is the key to these algorithms. Hemmecke et
al.~[Math. Prog. 2014] showed that 4-block $n$-fold IP has Graver elements of
$\ell_\infty$-norm at most $O_{FPT}(n^{2^{s_{D}}})$, leading to an algorithm
with a similar runtime; here, $s_{D}$ is the number of rows of matrix $D$ and $
O_{FPT}(1)$ hides a multiplicative factor that is only dependent on the small
matrices $A,B,C,D$.
  We prove that the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm of the Graver elements of 4-block
$n$-fold IP is upper bounded by $O_{FPT}(n^{s_{D}})$, improving significantly
over the previous bound $O_{FPT} (n^{2^{s_{D}}})$. We also provide a matching
lower bound of $\Omega(n^{s_{D}})$ which even holds for arbitrary non-zero
lattice elements, ruling out augmenting algorithm relying on even more
restricted notions of augmentation than the Graver basis. We then consider a
special case of 4-block $n$-fold in which $C$ is a zero matrix, called 3-block
$n$-fold IP. We show that while even there the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm of its
Graver elements is $\Omega(n^{s_{D}})$, there exists a different decomposition
into lattice elements whose $\ell_{\infty}$-norm is bounded by $ O_{FPT}(1)$,
which allows us to provide improved upper bounds on the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm of
Graver elements for 3-block $n$-fold IP.

crystal-fluid surface tensions in additive and nonadditive (Asakura-Oosawa
model) two-dimensional hard disk mixtures are determined for the whole range of
size ratios $q$ between disks, assuming random disorder in the crystal phase.
The fluid-crystal transitions are first-order due to the assumption of a
periodic unit cell in the density functional calculations. Qualitatively, the
shape of the phase diagrams is similar to the case of three-dimensional hard
sphere mixtures. For the nonadditive case, a broadening of the fluid-crystal
coexistence region is found for small $q$ whereas for higher $q$ a vapor--fluid
transition intervenes. In the additive case, we find a sequence of spindle
type, azeotropic and eutectic phase diagrams upon lowering $q$ from 1 to 0.6.
The transition from azeotropic to eutectic is different from the
three-dimensional case. Surface tensions in general become smaller (up to a
factor 2) upon addition of a second species and they are rather small. The
minimization of the functionals proceeds without restrictions and optimized
graphics card routines are used.

  Methods for Causal Inference using Five Empirical Applications",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When investigators seek to estimate causal effects, they often assume that
selection into treatment is based only on observed covariates. Under this
identification strategy, analysts must adjust for observed confounders. While
basic regression models have long been the dominant method of statistical
adjustment, more robust methods based on matching or weighting have become more
common. Of late, even more flexible methods based on machine learning methods
have been developed for statistical adjustment. These machine learning methods
are designed to be black box methods with little input from the researcher.
Recent research used a data competition to evaluate various methods of
statistical adjustment and found that black box methods out performed all other
methods of statistical adjustment. Matching methods with covariate
prioritization are designed for direct input from substantive investigators in
direct contrast to black methods. In this article, we use a different research
design to compare matching with covariate prioritization to black box methods.
We use black box methods to replicate results from five studies where matching
with covariate prioritization was used to customize the statistical adjustment
in direct response to substantive expertise. We find little difference across
the methods. We conclude with advice for investigators.

For example, villages might be assigned to treatment and control, but residents
in each village may choose to comply or not with their assigned treatment
status. When noncompliance is present, the instrumental variables framework can
be used to identify and estimate causal effects. While a large literature
exists on instrumental variables estimation methods, relatively little work has
been focused on settings with clustered treatments. Here, we review extant
methods for instrumental variable estimation in clustered designs and derive
both the finite and asymptotic properties of these estimators. We prove that
the properties of current estimators depend on unrealistic assumptions. We then
develop a new IV estimation method for cluster randomized trials and study its
formal properties. We prove that our IV estimator allows for possible treatment
effect heterogeneity that is correlated with cluster size and is robust to low
compliance rates within clusters. We evaluate these methods using simulations
and apply them to data from a randomized intervention in India.

an active array of sensors which probes a medium with pulses and measures the
resulting waves. The algorithm is motivated by the application of array
imaging. We describe it for a generic hyperbolic system that applies to
acoustic, electromagnetic or elastic waves in a scattering medium modeled by an
unknown coefficient called the reflectivity. The goal of imaging is to invert
the nonlinear mapping from the reflectivity to the array data. Many existing
imaging methodologies ignore the nonlinearity i.e., operate under the
assumption that the Born (single scattering) approximation is accurate. This
leads to image artifacts when multiple scattering is significant. Our algorithm
seeks to transform the array data to those corresponding to the Born
approximation, so it can be used as a pre-processing step for any linear
inversion method. The nonlinear data transformation algorithm is based on a
reduced order model defined by a proxy wave propagator operator that has four
important properties. First, it is data driven, meaning that it is constructed
from the data alone, with no knowledge of the medium. Second, it can be
factorized in two operators that have an approximately affine dependence on the
unknown reflectivity. This allows the computation of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative
of the reflectivity to the data mapping which gives the Born approximation.
Third, the algorithm involves regularization which balances numerical stability
and data fitting with accuracy of the order of the standard deviation of
additive data noise. Fourth, the algebraic nature of the algorithm makes it
applicable to scalar (acoustic) and vectorial (elastic, electromagnetic) wave
data without any specific modifications.

universal (or complete) compatibility operator for $K$ is a differential
operator $K_1$ such that $K_1 \circ K = 0$ and any other operator annihilating

  Measurement","13 pages",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Runtime integrity measurements identify unexpected changes in operating
systems and hypervisors during operation, enabling early detection of
persistent threats. System Management Mode, a privileged x86 CPU mode, has the
potential to effectively perform such rootkit detection. Previously proposed
SMM-based approaches demonstrated effective detection capabilities, but at a
cost of performance degradation and software side effects. In this paper we
introduce our solution to these problems, an SMM-based Extensible, Performance
Aware Runtime Integrity Measurement Mechanism called EPA-RIMM. The EPA-RIMM
architecture features a performance-sensitive design that decomposes large
integrity measurements and schedules them to control perturbation and side
effects. EPA-RIMM's decomposition of long-running measurements into shorter
tasks, extensibility, and use of SMM complicates the efforts of malicious code
to detect or avoid the integrity measurements. Using a Minnowboard-based
prototype, we demonstrate its detection capabilities and performance impacts.
Early results are promising, and suggest that EPA-RIMM will meet
production-level performance constraints while continuously monitoring key OS
and hypervisor data structures for signs of attack.

with its quadratic convergence properties. The formulation relies on the

first order `deconfined' phase transitions using Monte Carlo simulations and a
renormalization group analysis. We study a transition in a 3D classical loop
model that is analogous to a deconfined 2+1D quantum phase transition in a
magnet with reduced lattice symmetry. The transition is between the N\'eel
phase and a twofold degenerate valence bond solid (lattice-symmetry-breaking)
phase. The combined order parameter at the transition is effectively a
four-component superspin. It has been argued that in some weakly first order
`pseudocritical' deconfined phase transitions, the renormalization group flow
can take the system very close to the ordered fixed point of the symmetric
$O(N)$ sigma model, where $N$ is the total number of `soft' order parameter
components, despite the fact that $O(N)$ is not a microscopic symmetry. This
yields a first order transition with unconventional phenomenology. We argue
that this occurs in the present model, with $N=4$. This means that there is a
regime of lengthscales in which the transition resembles a `spin-flop'
transition in the ordered $O(4)$ sigma model. We give numerical evidence for
(i) the first order nature of the transition, (ii) the emergence of $O(4)$
symmetry to an accurate approximation, and (iii) the existence of a regime in
which the emergent $O(4)$ is `spontaneously broken', with distinctive features
in the order parameter probability distribution. These results may be relevant
for other models studied in the literature, including 2+1D QED with two

fluctuating initial condition from A-Multi-Phase-Transport (AMPT) model.
Detailed analysis is performed on the longitudinal decorrelations of elliptic,
triangular and quadrangular flows in terms of flow vectors, flow magnitudes and
flow orientations (event planes). It is found that pure flow magnitudes have
smaller longitudinal decorrelation than pure flow orientations, and the
decorrelation of flow vectors is a combined effect of both flow magnitudes and
orientations. The longitudinal decorrelation of elliptic flow has a strong and
non-monotonic centrality dependence due to the initial elliptic collision
geometry: smallest decorrelation in mid-central collisions. In contrast, the
decorrelations of triangular and quadrangular flows have weak centrality
dependence, slightly larger decorrelations in more peripheral collisions. Our
numerical results for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC are in good agreement with
the ATLAS data, while our RHIC results predict much larger longitudinal
decorrelations as compared to the LHC. We further analyze the longitudinal
structures of the AMPT initial conditions and find that the final-state
longitudinal decorrelation effects are strongly correlated with the lengths of
the initial string structures in the AMPT model. The decorrelation effects are
typically larger at lower collision energies and in more peripheral collisions
due to shorter lengths of the string structures in the initial states.

phonon-polariton (SPhP) resonance of a silicon carbide (SiC) bulk mediated by a

(LDOS) in a non-resonant intrinsic silicon (Si) film due to thermal emission by
SiC, derived using fluctuational electrodynamics, exhibits a local maximum near
SPhP resonant frequency in addition to a lower frequency resonance generated by
gap modes emerging in the vacuum gap separating the SiC and Si layers. Multiple
reflections within the vacuum gap also induce a LDOS drop around SPhP resonant
frequency. As a result, depending on the film thickness to vacuum gap ratio and
the location where the LDOS is calculated in the film, the low-frequency
resonance can dominate the LDOS, such that SPhP resonance appears to be
redshifted. A similar spectral behavior is observed on the monochromatic
radiative heat flux absorbed by the Si film. It is shown that apparent spectral
(red and blue) shift of SPhP resonance mediated by a non-resonant film is
bounded by the transverse and longitudinal optical phonon frequencies of SiC.
This work is of importance in applications involving dissimilar materials, such
as thermophotovoltaics and thermal rectification, where gap modes may
significantly disrupt flux resonance. Gap modes may also be at the origin of
the resonance redshift systematically observed in near-field thermal
spectroscopy.

about 10 percentage points over the (a) motif scanning method and (b) the

interstitials and the associated self-diffusion mechanisms in {\alpha}-Cr2O3
reveals that interstitials are more mobile than vacancies of corresponding
species. Cr interstitials occupy the unoccupied Cr sublattice sites that are
octahedrally coordinated by 6 O atoms, and O interstitials form a dumbbell
configuration orientated along the [221] direction (diagonal) of the corundum
lattice. Calculations predict that neutral O interstitials are predominant in
O-rich conditions and Cr interstitials in +2 and +1 charge states are the
dominant interstitial defects in Cr-rich conditions. Similar to that of the
vacancies, the charge transition levels of both O and Cr interstitials are
located deep within the bandgap. Transport calculations reveal a rich variety
of interstitial diffusion mechanisms that are species, charge, and orientation
dependent. Cr interstitials diffuse preferably along the diagonal of corundum
lattice in a two step process via an intermediate defect complex comprising a
Cr interstitial and an adjacent Cr Frenkel defect in the neighboring Cr
bilayer. This mechanism is similar to that of the vacancy mediated Cr diffusion
along the c-axis with intermediate Cr vacancy and Cr Frenkel defect
combination. In contrast, O interstitials diffuse via bond switching mechanism.
O interstitials in -1 and -2 charge states have very high mobility compared to
neutral O interstitials.

article, we develop Auslander--Reiten theory for extriangulated categories.
This unifies Auslander--Reiten theories developed in exact categories and
triangulated categories independently. We give two different sets of sufficient
conditions on the extriangulated category so that existence of almost-split
extensions becomes equivalent to that of an Auslander--Reiten--Serre duality.
We also show that existence of almost-split extensions is preserved under
taking relative extriangulated categories, ideal quotients, and
extension-closed subcategories. Moreover, we prove that the stable category
$\underline{\mathscr{C}}$ of an extriangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ is a
$\tau$-category if $\mathscr{C}$ has almost split extensions and source
morphisms. This gives various consequences on $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$,
including Igusa--Todorov's Radical Layers Theorem. In particular, the
associated completely graded category of $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$ is
equivalent to the complete mesh category of the Auslander-Reiten species of
$\underline{\mathscr{C}}$.

synchronization in all-to-all coupled networks of phase oscillators with random
intrinsic frequencies. Specifically, he identified a critical value of the
coupling strength, at which the incoherent state loses stability and a gradual
build-up of coherence begins. Recently, Kuramoto's scenario was shown to hold
for a large class of coupled systems on convergent families of deterministic
and random graphs. Guided by these results, in the present work, we study
several model problems illustrating the link between network topology and
synchronization in coupled dynamical systems.
  First, we identify several families of graphs, for which the transition to
synchronization in the Kuramoto model starts at the same critical value of the
coupling strength and proceeds in practically the same way. These examples
include Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, Paley graphs, complete bipartite
graphs, and certain stochastic block graphs. These examples illustrate that
some rather simple structural properties such as the volume of the graph may
determine the onset of synchronization, while finer structural features may
affect only higher order statistics of the transition to synchronization.
Further, we study the transition to synchronization in the Kuramoto model on
power law and small-world random graphs. The former family of graphs endows the
Kuramoto model with very good synchronizability: the synchronization threshold
can be made arbitrarily low by varying the parameter of the power law degree
distribution. For the Kuramoto model on small-world graphs, in addition to the
transition to synchronization, we identify a new bifurcation leading to stable
random twisted states. The examples analyzed in this work complement the
results in [Chiba, Medvedev, The mean field analysis for the Kuramoto model on
graphs (parts I and II), arxiv].

through neural plasticity to many of the features observed experimentally in
the early stages of visual processing was provided by Linkser in a seminal,
three-paper series. Owing to the complexity of multi-layer models, an implicit
assumption in Linsker's and subsequent papers has been that propagation delay
is homogeneous and plays little functional role in neural behaviour. We relax
this assumption to examine the impact of distance-dependent axonal propagation
delay on neural learning. We show that propagation delay induces low-pass
filtering by dispersing the arrival times of spikes from presynaptic neurons,
providing a natural correlation cancellation mechanism for distal connections.
The cut-off frequency decreases as the radial propagation delay within a layer
increases relative to propagation delay between the layers, introducing an
upper limit on temporal resolution. Given that the PSP also acts as a low-pass
filter, we show that the effective time constant of each should enable the
processing of similar scales of temporal information. This result has
implications for the visual system, in which receptive field size and, thus,
radial propagation delay, increases with eccentricity. Furthermore, the network
response is frequency dependent since higher frequencies require increased
input amplitude to compensate for attenuation. This concords with
frequency-dependent contrast sensitivity in the visual system, which changes
with eccentricity and receptive field size. We further show that the proportion
of inhibition relative to excitation is larger where radial propagation delay
is long relative to inter-laminar propagation delay. We show that the addition
of propagation delay reduces the range in the cell's on-center size, providing
stability to variations in homeostatic parameters.

diffusing reactants. The dynamics of such systems can be captured by stochastic
reaction networks. A recent numerical study has shown that diffusion can
significantly enhance the fluctuations in gene regulatory networks. However,
the universal relation between diffusion and stochastic system dynamics remains
veiled. Within the approximation of reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME),
we find general relation that the steady-state distribution in complex balanced
networks is diffusion-independent. Here, complex balance is the nonequilibrium
generalization of detailed balance. We also find that for a diffusion-included
network with a Poisson-like steady-state distribution, the diffusion can be
ignored at steady state. We then derive a necessary and sufficient condition
for networks holding such steady-state distributions. Moreover, we show that
for linear reaction networks the RDME reduces to the chemical master equation,
which implies that the stochastic dynamics of networks is unaffected by
diffusion at any arbitrary time. Our findings shed light on the fundamental
question of when diffusion can be neglected, or (if nonnegligible) its effects
on the stochastic dynamics of the reaction network.

the sign of the Hall effect not only depends on the direction of the local

  As the Hall and the Ohm diffusion are comparable below 80 km, the low

characterize a macroscopic system. An overwhelming majority of the pure state
looks almost identical if we neglect macroscopic non-local correlations,
suggesting that thermal equilibrium is the collection of the typical
properties. Quantum entanglement, which characterizes a non-local correlation,
also has a typical behavior in equilibrium systems. However, it remains elusive
whether there is a typical behavior of entanglement in dynamical
non-equilibrium systems. To investigate the typicality, we consider a situation
where a system in a pure state starts to share entanglement with its
environment system due to the interaction between them. Assuming the initial
state is randomly chosen from an ensemble of pure states, a criteria for the
typicality of the R\'enyi entropies is presented. In addition, it is
analytically proven that the second R\'enyi entropy has a typical behavior in
two cases. The first one is an energy dissipation process in a multiple-qubit
system which is initially in a random pure state in an energy shell. Since the
typical behavior is qualitatively the same as the prediction of the Page curve
conjecture, it gives the first proof of the Page curve conjecture in a
dynamical process. In the second case, the typicality is proven for any

transfer (WPT) system, in which a UAV equipped with a directional antenna is
dispatched to deliver wireless energy to charge two energy receivers (ERs) on
the ground. Under this setup, we maximize the common (or minimum) energy
received by the two ERs over a particular finite charging period, by jointly
optimizing the altitude, trajectory, and transmit beamwidth of the UAV, subject
to the UAV's maximum speed constraints, as well as the maximum/minimum altitude
and beamwidth constraints. However, the common energy maximization is a
non-convex optimization problem that is generally difficult to be solved
optimally. To tackle this problem, we first ignore the maximum UAV speed
constraints and solve the relaxed problem optimally. The optimal solution to
the relaxed problem reveals that the UAV should hover above two symmetric
locations during the whole charging period, with the corresponding altitude and
beamwidth optimized. Next, we study the original problem with the maximum UAV
speed constraints considered, for which a heuristic hover-fly-hover trajectory
design is proposed based on the optimal symmetric-location-hovering solution to
the relaxed problem. Numerical results validate that thanks to the employment
of directional antenna with adaptive beamwidth and altitude control, our
proposed design significantly improves the common energy received by the two
ERs, as compared to other benchmark schemes.

not until recently have researchers started looking at wideband spectrum.
Broadly speaking, wideband spectrum sensing approaches can be categorized into
two classes: Nyquist-rate and sub-Nyquist-rate sampling approaches.
Nyquist-rate approaches have major practical issues that question their
suitability for realtime applications; this is mainly because their high-rate
sampling requirement calls for complex hardware and signal processing
algorithms that incur significant delays. Sub-Nyquist-rate approaches, on the
other hand, are more appealing due to their less stringent sampling-rate
requirement. Although various concepts have been investigated to ensure
sub-Nyquist rates, compressive sampling theory is definitely one concept that
has attracted so much interest. This paper explains and illustrates how
compressive sampling has been leveraged to improve wideband spectrum sensing by
enabling spectrum occupancy recovery with sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The paper
also introduces new ideas with great potential for further wideband spectrum
sensing enhancements, and identifies key future research challenges and
directions that remain to be investigated.

its orbit through three-body scattering until the black holes are close enough

analysis of a static SMBH-embedded galaxy potential to support this view; it is
not clear, however, how these orbits transform as the second SMBH enters the
center, so our understanding of which orbits actually interact with a SMBH
binary is not ironclad. Here, we analyze two flattened galaxy models, one with
a single SMBH and one with a binary, to determine which orbits actually do
interact with the SMBH binary and how they compare with the set predicted in
single SMBH-embedded models. We find close correspondence between the
centrophilic orbits predicted to interact with the binary and those that are
actually scattered by the binary, in terms of energy and Lz distribution, where
Lz is the z component of a stellar particle's angular momentum. Of minor note:
because of the larger mass, the binary SMBH has a radius of influence about 4
times larger than in the single SMBH model, which allows the binary to draw
from a larger reservoir of orbits to scatter. Of the prediction particles and
scattered particles, nearly half have chaotic orbits, 40% have fx:fy=1:1

formation and abundance of cosmic voids. We consider dark energy to be a fluid
with a negative pressure characterised by a constant equation of state w and
speed of sound $c^2_s$. By solving fluid equations for two components, namely,
dark matter and dark energy fluids, we quantify the effects of dark energy
perturbation on the sizes of top-hat voids. We also explore the effects on the
size distribution of voids based on the excursion set theory. We confirm that
dark energy perturbation negligibly affects the size evolution of voids;$c^2_s
= 0$ varies the size only by 0.1% as compared to the homogeneous dark energy
model. We also confirm that dark energy perturbation suppresses the void size
when w < -1 and enhances the void size when $w > -1$ (Basse et al. 2011). In
contrast to the negligible impact on the size, we find that the size
distribution function on scales larger than 10 Mpc/h highly depends on dark
energy perturbation; compared to the homogeneous dark energy model, the number
of large voids of radius 30Mpc is 25% larger for the model with $w = -0.9$ and
$c^2_s = 0$ while they are 20% less abundant for the model with $w = -1.3$ and
$c^2_s = 0$.

We compute the stellar population properties of galaxies using spectral energy
distribution and spectral fitting techniques, and study the dependence of star
formation rates (SFR), colours, and stellar ages on environment. For r<20, the
fraction of SFing/blue galaxies, computed either from the specific-SFR (sSFR)

where the number of galaxies with log(sSFR/yr^-1)>-12 and with (g-r)_rf<0.6 is
lower than in the field. For log(M*/M_sun)>10.8, no trends with environment
emerge, as massive galaxies are mostly already passive in all environments. No
differences among low- and high-density field members and cluster members
emerge in the sSFR-mass relation. The luminosity-weighted age-mass relation of
the passive populations within cluster virial radii show signatures of recent
environmental quenching. The study of luminous and massive galaxies in this

the fractions of SFing/blue galaxies, its effects on the star formation
activity in SFing galaxies are negligible.

Changing the threshold or biasing of the system changes the output to another
logic operation and memory latch. The interplay of nonlinearity and
quasiperiodic forcing yields logic behaviour and the emergent out- come of such
a system is a logic gate. It is further shown that the logical behaviours
persist even for experimental noise floor. Thus the SNA turns out to be an
efficient tool for computation.

magnetic field is investigated in theory. Under low magnetic field, the
transport is determined by the resonant tunneling of Landau levels and
conductance versus magnetic field shows a Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation. At
higher magnetic field, the p-n junction subjected to the quasi-classical regime
and the formation of snake states results in periodical backscattering and
transmission as magnetic field varies. The conductance oscillation pattern is
mediated both by magnetic field and the carrier concentration on bipolar
regions. For medium magnetic field between above two regimes, the combined
contributions of resonant tunneling, snake states oscillation and Aharanov-Bohm
interference induce irregular oscillation of conductance. At very high magnetic
field, the system is subjected to quantum Hall regime. Under disorder, the
quantum tunneling at low magnetic field is slightly affected and the
oscillation of snake states at higher magnetic field is suppressed. In the
quantum Hall regime, the conductance is a constant as predicted by the mixture

from a momentum-dependent breakdown of quasiparticle coherence that sets in at
much higher doping levels but which is driven by the proximity to the Mott
insulating state at half filling. Finally, we present a new scenario for the
cuprates in which this loss of quasiparticle integrity and its evolution with
momentum, temperature and doping plays a key role in shaping the resultant

A preliminary version appeared in ITCS'18",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the 2-ary constraint satisfaction problems (2-CSPs), which can be
stated as follows: given a constraint graph $G=(V,E)$, an alphabet set $\Sigma$
and, for each $\{u, v\}\in E$, a constraint $C_{uv} \subseteq
\Sigma\times\Sigma$, the goal is to find an assignment $\sigma: V \to \Sigma$
that satisfies as many constraints as possible, where a constraint $C_{uv}$ is
satisfied if $(\sigma(u),\sigma(v))\in C_{uv}$.
  While the approximability of 2-CSPs is quite well understood when $|\Sigma|$
is constant, many problems are still open when $|\Sigma|$ becomes super
constant. One such problem is whether it is hard to approximate 2-CSPs to
within a polynomial factor of $|\Sigma| |V|$. Bellare et al. (1993) suggested
that the answer to this question might be positive. Alas, despite efforts to
resolve this conjecture, it remains open to this day.
  In this work, we separate $|V|$ and $|\Sigma|$ and ask a related but weaker
question: is it hard to approximate 2-CSPs to within a polynomial factor of
$|V|$ (while $|\Sigma|$ may be super-polynomial in $|V|$)? Assuming the
exponential time hypothesis (ETH), we answer this question positively by
showing that no polynomial time algorithm can approximate 2-CSPs to within a
factor of $|V|^{1 - o(1)}$. Note that our ratio is almost linear, which is
almost optimal as a trivial algorithm gives a $|V|$-approximation for 2-CSPs.
  Thanks to a known reduction, our result implies an ETH-hardness of
approximating Directed Steiner Network with ratio $k^{1/4 - o(1)}$ where $k$ is
the number of demand pairs. The ratio is roughly the square root of the best
known ratio achieved by polynomial time algorithms (Chekuri et al., 2011;
Feldman et al., 2012).
  Additionally, under Gap-ETH, our reduction for 2-CSPs not only rules out
polynomial time algorithms, but also FPT algorithms parameterized by $|V|$.
Similar statement applies for DSN parameterized by $k$.

parameters and underlying physics is however not well understood. In this
paper, we use three dimensional numerical simulations to uncover the effect of
deformability of bubbles injected in a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow on the
overall drag experienced by the system. We consider two different Reynolds
numbers for the carrier flow, i.e. $Re_i=5\times 10^3$ and $Re_i=2\times 10^4$;
the deformability of the bubbles is controlled through the Weber number which
is varied in the range $We=0.01 - 2.0$. Our numerical simulations show that
increasing the deformability of bubbles i.e., $We$ leads to an increase in drag
reduction. We look at the different physical effects contributing to drag
reduction and analyse their individual contributions with increasing bubble
deformability. Profiles of local angular velocity flux show that in the
presence of bubbles, turbulence is enhanced near the inner cylinder while
attenuated in the bulk and near the outer cylinder. We connect the increase in
drag reduction to the decrease in dissipation in the wake of highly deformed
bubbles near the inner cylinder.

$m\sim r^{1.67}$. At a given scale, the masses of our objects are around 1/10
of that of typical Galactic massive star-forming regions. Analysis of the clump

that the PGCCs in our sample have a low core formation efficiency

Statistical study indicates that the 850\,$\mu$m cores are more turbulent, more
optically thick, and denser than the $^{13}$CO clumps for star formation
candidates, suggesting that the 850\,$\mu$m cores are likely more appropriate

binary neurons as a function of a network's level of dilution and asymmetry.
The network dilution measures the fraction of neuron couples that are
connected, and the network asymmetry measures to what extent the underlying
connectivity matrix is asymmetric. For each given neural network, we study the
dynamical evolution of all the different initial conditions, thus
characterizing the full dynamical landscape without imposing any learning rule.
Because of the deterministic dynamics, each trajectory converges to an
attractor, that can be either a fixed point or a limit cycle. These attractors
form the set of all the possible limit behaviors of the neural network. For
each network, we then determine the convergence times, the limit cycles'
length, the number of attractors, and the sizes of the attractors' basin. We
show that there are two network structures that maximize the number of possible
limit behaviors. The first optimal network structure is fully-connected and
symmetric. On the contrary, the second optimal network structure is highly
sparse and asymmetric. The latter optimal is similar to what observed in
different biological neuronal circuits. These observations lead us to
hypothesize that independently from any given learning model, an efficient and
effective biologic network that stores a number of limit behaviors close to its
maximum capacity tends to develop a connectivity structure similar to one of
the optimal networks we found.

gravitational wave data analysis of inspiralling and coalescing compact
binaries. We show that the post-adiabatic (PA) approximation to the
effective-one-body (EOB) description of the binary dynamics, when pushed to
high-order, allows one to accurately and efficiently compute the waveform of
coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) or black holes (BBHs) up to a few orbits
before merger. This is accomplished bypassing the usual need of numerically
solving the relative EOB dynamics described by a set of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Under the assumption that radiation reaction is small, the
Hamilton's equations for the momenta can be solved {\it analytically} for given
values of the relative separation. Time and orbital phase are then recovered by
simple numerical quadratures. For the least-adiabatic BBH case, equal-mass,
quasi-extremal spins anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, 6PA/8PA
orders are able to generate waveforms that accumulate less than $10^{-3}$ rad
of phase difference with respect to the complete EOB ones up to $\sim 3$ orbits
before merger. Analogous results hold for BNSs. The PA waveform generation is
extremely efficient: for a standard BNS system from 10Hz, a nonoptimized Matlab
implementation of the TEOBResumS EOB model in the PA approximation is more than
100 times faster ($\sim 0.09$ sec) than the corresponding $C^{++}$ code based
on a standard ODE solver. Once optimized further, our approach will allow to:
(i) avoid the use of the fast, but often inaccurate, post-Newtonian inspiral
waveforms, drastically reducing the impact of systematics due to inspiral
waveform modelling; (ii) alleviate the need of constructing EOB waveform
surrogates to be used in parameter estimation codes.

minimise the Kullback-Leibler divergence to approximate the true posterior over
the weights. However, this approximation is without knowledge of the final
application, and therefore cannot guarantee optimal predictions for a given
task. To make more suitable task-specific approximations, we introduce a new
loss-calibrated evidence lower bound for Bayesian neural networks in the
context of supervised learning, informed by Bayesian decision theory. By
introducing a lower bound that depends on a utility function, we ensure that
our approximation achieves higher utility than traditional methods for
applications that have asymmetric utility functions. Furthermore, in using
dropout inference, we highlight that our new objective is identical to that of
standard dropout neural networks, with an additional utility-dependent penalty
term. We demonstrate our new loss-calibrated model with an illustrative medical
example and a restricted model capacity experiment, and highlight failure modes
of the comparable weighted cross entropy approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the
scalability of our method to real world applications with per-pixel semantic
segmentation on an autonomous driving data set.

transfer and the variability of spectrum parameters that accompany the
long-term evolution of nonlinear swell. The cases of initial two-dimensional
spectra of the different frequency decay-law with the power n and various
initial functions of the angular distribution are considered. It is shown that
at the first step of the kinetic equation solution, the nonlinear energy
transfer asymptote has the power-like decay-law with values p less n-1, valid
for cases in which n greater 5, and the difference, n-p, changes significantly
when n approaches 4. On time scales of evolution greater than several hundred
initial wave-periods, in every case, a self-similar spectrum Ssf is established
with the frequency decay-law of power -4. Herein, the asymptote of nonlinear
energy transfer becomes negative in value and decreases according to the same
law The peak frequency of the spectrum migrates to the low-frequency region
such that the angular and frequency characteristics of the two-dimensional
spectrum Ssf remain constant. However, these characteristics depend on the
degree of angular anisotropy of the initial spectrum. The solutions obtained
are interpreted, and their connection with the analytical solutions of the

intermediate-velocity and high-velocity gas clouds whose origin has defied
clear explanation. They are generally believed to be involved in a Galaxy-wide
recycling process, either through an accretion flow or a large-scale fountain
flow, or both. We examine the evolution of these clouds in light of recent
claims that they may trigger condensation of gas from the Galactic corona as
they move through it. We measure condensation along a cloud's wake, with and
without the presence of an ambient magnetic field, using two- (2D) and
three-dimensional (3D), high-resolution simulations. We find that 3D
simulations are essential to correctly capture the condensation in all cases.
Magnetic fields significantly inhibit condensation in the wake of clouds at $t
\gtrsim 25$ Myr, preventing the sharp upturn in cold gas mass seen in previous
non-magnetic studies. The magnetic field suppresses the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability responsible for the ablation and consequent mixing of a cloud with
halo gas which drives the condensation. This effect is universal across
different cloud properties (density, metallicity, velocity) and magnetic field
properties (strength and orientation). Simple convergence tests demonstrate
that resolving the gas on progressively smaller scales leads to even less
condensation. While condensation still occurs in all cases, our results show
that an ambient magnetic field drastically lowers the efficiency of
fountain-driven accretion and likely also accretion from condensation around
high-velocity clouds. These lower specific accretion rates are in better
agreement with observational constraints compared to 3D, non-magnetic
simulations.

respectively. The behaviors of the BF stars in the CMD are well explained by
the H-MS + He-star systems. The BF stars provide a strict restriction on the

for image classification. However, recent works have exposed its limitation on
feature discriminability. This paper casts a new viewpoint on the weakness of
softmax loss. On the one hand, the CNN features learned using the softmax loss
are often inadequately discriminative. We hence introduce a soft-margin softmax
function to explicitly encourage the discrimination between different classes.
On the other hand, the learned classifier of softmax loss is weak. We propose
to assemble multiple these weak classifiers to a strong one, inspired by the
recognition that the diversity among weak classifiers is critical to a good
ensemble. To achieve the diversity, we adopt the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence
Criterion (HSIC). Considering these two aspects in one framework, we design a
novel loss, named as Ensemble soft-Margin Softmax (EM-Softmax). Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our
design over the baseline softmax loss and several state-of-the-art
alternatives.

Sampling via Sequential Monte Carlo (NS-SMC), which reframes the Nested
Sampling method of Skilling (2006) in terms of sequential Monte Carlo
techniques. This new framework allows convergence results to be obtained in the
setting when Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to produce new samples. An
additional benefit is that marginal likelihood estimates are unbiased. In
contrast to NS, the analysis of NS-SMC does not require the (unrealistic)
assumption that the simulated samples be independent. As the original NS
algorithm is a special case of NS-SMC, this provides insights as to why NS
seems to produce accurate estimates despite a typical violation of its
assumptions. For applications of NS-SMC, we give advice on tuning MCMC kernels
in an automated manner via a preliminary pilot run, and present a new method
for appropriately choosing the number of MCMC repeats at each iteration.
Finally, a numerical study is conducted where the performance of NS-SMC and
temperature-annealed SMC is compared on several challenging and realistic
problems. MATLAB code for our experiments is made available at

purely affine theory of gravity and its cosmological implication. A particular
attention will be devoted to its consequences when applied to cosmological
inflation. Primarily, affine spacetime, composed of geodesics with no notion of
length and angle, accommodates gravity but not matter. The thesis study is
expected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime
and may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical
gravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary
regime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric
tensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the
inflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to
avoid the use of the so called conformal frames. In fact, unlike metric
gravity, the metric tensor in affine gravity is generated and not postulated a
priori, thus this tensor is absent in the actions and conformal transformation
does not make sense. Last but not least, we try to show how metric gravity can
be induced through a simple structure that contains only affine connection and
scalar fields. General relativity arises classically only at the vacuum, and
this view of gravity may be considered as a new way to inducing metric
elasticity of space, not through quantum corrections as in standard induced
gravity, but only classically. The thesis is concluded by analyzing affine
gravity in a particular higher-dimensional manifold (product of two spaces) in
an attempt to understand both, the cosmological constant and matter
dynamically.

related to a usual convexity, in the present paper we derive several more
accurate operator Jensen-type inequalities for certain subclasses of convex
functions. More precisely, we obtain interpolating series of Jensen-type
inequalities for log-convex and non-negative superquadratic functions. In
particular, we obtain the corresponding refinements of the Jensen-Mercer
operator inequality for such classes of functions.

considering a nearly Gaussian distribution of cosmological perturbations, and
assuming that black holes will form in regions where the amplitude of such
perturbations exceeds a certain threshold. A threshold $\zeta_{\rm th}$ for the
curvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it
depends significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local
dynamics. By contrast, a threshold $\delta_{\rm th}$ for the density
perturbation at horizon crossing seems to provide a more robust criterion. On
the other hand, the density perturbation is known to be bounded above by a
maximum limit $\delta_{\rm max}$, and given that $\delta_{\rm th}$ is
comparable to $\delta_{\rm max}$, the density perturbation will be far from
Gaussian near or above the threshold. In this paper, we provide a new plausible
estimate for the primordial black hole abundance based on peak theory. In our
approach, we assume that the curvature perturbation is given as a random
Gaussian field with the power spectrum characterized by a single scale, while
an optimized criterion for PBH formation is imposed, based on the locally
averaged density perturbation. Both variables are related by the full nonlinear
expression derived in the long-wavelength approximation of general relativity.
We do not introduce a window function, and the scale of the inhomogeneity is
introduced as a random variable in the peak theory. We find that the mass
spectrum is shifted to larger mass scales by one order of magnitude or so,
compared to a conventional calculation. The abundance of PBHs becomes
significantly larger than the conventional one, by many orders of magnitude,
mainly due to the optimized criterion for PBH formation and the removal of the
suppresion associated with a window function.

academia. Our system is unsupervised and it jointly combines classical language
modeling techniques, based on text evidences, with the Wikipedia Knowledge
Graph, via entity linking.
  WISER indexes each academic author through a novel profiling technique which
models her expertise with a small, labeled and weighted graph drawn from
Wikipedia. Nodes in this graph are the Wikipedia entities mentioned in the
author's publications, whereas the weighted edges express the semantic
relatedness among these entities computed via textual and graph-based
relatedness functions. Every node is also labeled with a relevance score which
models the pertinence of the corresponding entity to author's expertise, and is
computed by means of a proper random-walk calculation over that graph; and with
a latent vector representation which is learned via entity and other kinds of
structural embeddings derived from Wikipedia.
  At query time, experts are retrieved by combining classic document-centric
approaches, which exploit the occurrences of query terms in the author's
documents, with a novel set of profile-centric scoring strategies, which
compute the semantic relatedness between the author's expertise and the query
topic via the above graph-based profiles.
  The effectiveness of our system is established over a large-scale
experimental test on a standard dataset for this task. We show that WISER
achieves better performance than all the other competitors, thus proving the
effectiveness of modelling author's profile via our ""semantic"" graph of
entities. Finally, we comment on the use of WISER for indexing and profiling
the whole research community within the University of Pisa, and its application
to technology transfer in our University.

The paper contains the proof of the estimate $$ \mathbb E \Psi(N_t) \leq

\mathbb R_+$ are convex continuous functions and the least admissible constant
$C_{\Phi,\Psi,X}$ coincides with the $\Phi,\Psi$-norm of the periodic Hilbert

periodic Hilbert transform, the Hilbert transform on the real line, and the
discrete Hilbert transform are the same if $\Phi$ is symmetric. We also prove
that under certain natural assumptions on $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, the condition
$C_{\Phi,\Psi,X}<\infty$ yields the UMD property of the space $X$. As an
application, we provide comparison of $L^p$-norms of the periodic Hilbert

differential equations (PDE's) are the algebraic system assembly and the
iterative solver. This work focuses on the first task, in the context of a
hybrid MPI+X paradigm. Although we will describe algorithms in the FE context,
a similar strategy can be straightforwardly applied to other discretization
methods, like the finite volume method. The matrix assembly consists of a loop
over the elements of the MPI partition to compute element matrices and
right-hand sides and their assemblies in the local system to each MPI
partition. In a MPI+X hybrid parallelism context, X has consisted traditionally
of loop parallelism using OpenMP. Several strategies have been proposed in the
literature to implement this loop parallelism, like coloring or substructuring
techniques to circumvent the race condition that appears when assembling the
element system into the local system. The main drawback of the first technique
is the decrease of the IPC due to bad spatial locality. The second technique
avoids this issue but requires extensive changes in the implementation, which
can be cumbersome when several element loops should be treated. We propose an
alternative, based on the task parallelism of the element loop using some
extensions to the OpenMP programming model. The taskification of the assembly
solves both aforementioned problems. In addition, dynamic load balance will be
applied using the DLB library, especially efficient in the presence of hybrid
meshes, where the relative costs of the different elements is impossible to
estimate a priori. This paper presents the proposed methodology, its
implementation and its validation through the solution of large computational
mechanics problems up to 16k cores.

Another departure in our approach, from standard neural networks, is that the
loss function is replaced by a constraint. This constraint is simply that the
value of the output node associated with the correct class should be zero. Our
model has the property that the exact norm-minimizing parameter update,
required to correctly classify a training item, is the solution to a quadratic
program that can be computed with a few passes through the network. We
demonstrate a training algorithm using this update, called sequential
deactivation (SDA), on MNIST and some synthetic datasets. Upon adopting a

While a straightforward application faces with the singular-drift problem,
which spoils the validity of the method, we overcome this problem by the
deformation technique proposed earlier. Explicit results for the quark number
density and the chiral condensate obtained in this way for $3.2\leq \mu/T\leq

means each robot has a limited visibility. We consider the weakest assumption
for myopia: each robot can only observe its neighboring nodes. Luminosity means
each robot maintains a non-volatile visible light. We consider the weakest
assumption for luminosity: each robot can use only two colors for its light.
The main interest of this paper is to clarify the impact of luminosity on
exploration with myopic robots. As a main contribution, we prove that 1) in the
fully synchronous model, two and three robots are necessary and sufficient to
achieve perpetual and terminating exploration, respectively, and 2) in the
semi-synchronous and asynchronous models, three and four robots are necessary
and sufficient to achieve perpetual and terminating exploration, respectively.
These results clarify the power of lights for myopic robots since, without
lights, five robots are necessary and sufficient to achieve terminating
exploration in the fully synchronous model, and no terminating exploration
algorithm exists in the semi-synchronous and asynchronous models. We also show
that, in the fully synchronous model (resp., the semi-synchronous and
asynchronous models), the proposed perpetual exploration algorithm is
universal, that is, the algorithm solves perpetual exploration from any
solvable initial configuration with two (resp., three) robots and two colors.
On the other hand, we show that, in the fully synchronous model (resp., the
semi-synchronous and asynchronous models), no universal algorithm exists for
terminating exploration, that is, no algorithm may solve terminating
exploration from any solvable initial configuration with three (resp., four)
robots and two colors.

flavors of O($a$)-improved Wilson fermions and a quenched strange quark. Our
initial point-source method for constructing correlators does not allow for
bilocal operators at the source; nevertheless, results from using these

ground state in comparison with the local operators. We also present results,
in the rest frame, using a second method based on distillation to compute a
hermitian matrix of correlators with bilocal operators at both the source and
the sink. This method yields a much more precise and reliable determination of
the ground-state energy. In the flavor-SU(3) symmetric case, we apply
L\""uscher's finite-volume quantization condition to the rest-frame and

observational uncertainties, but avoid effects of those model uncertainties. We
consider two full-spectrum fitting codes: pPXF and STARLIGHT, in fitting for
stellar population age, metallicity, mass-to-light ratio, and dust extinction.
With pPXF we find that both the bias in the population parameters and the
scatter in the recovered logarithmic values follows the expected trend. The
bias increases for younger ages and systematically makes recovered ages older,
$M_*/L_r$ larger and metallicities lower than the true values. For reference,
at S/N=30, and for the worst case ($t=10^8$yr), the bias is 0.06 dex in
$M_*/L_r$, 0.03 dex in both age and [M/H]. There is no significant dependence
on either E(B-V) or the shape of the error spectrum. Moreover, the results are
consistent for both our 1-SSP and 2-SSP tests. With the STARLIGHT algorithm, we
find trends similar to pPXF, when the input E(B-V)<0.2 mag. However, with
larger input E(B-V), the biases of the output parameter do not converge to zero
even at the highest S/N and are strongly affected by the shape of the error
spectra. This effect is particularly dramatic for youngest age, for which all
population parameters can be strongly different from the input values, with
significantly underestimated dust extinction and [M/H], and larger ages and
$M_*/L_r$. Results degrade when moving from our 1-SSP to the 2-SSP tests. The
STARLIGHT convergence to the true values can be improved by increasing Markov
Chains and annealing loops to the ""slow mode"". For the same input spectrum,
pPXF is about two order of magnitudes faster than STARLIGHT's ""default mode""
and about three order of magnitude faster than STARLIGHT's ""slow mode"".

various nucleoid-associated proteins, including the ATPase SMC condensin.
Although the molecular structure of these ATPases has been mapped in detail, it
still remains unclear by which physical mechanisms they collectively generate
long-range chromosomal contacts. Here, we develop a computational model that
captures the subtle interplay between molecular-scale activity of slip-links
and large-scale chromosome organization. We first consider a scenario in which
the ATPase activity of slip-links regulates their DNA-recruitment near the
origin of replication, while the slip-link dynamics is assumed to be diffusive.
We find that such diffusive slip-links can collectively organize the entire
chromosome into a state with aligned arms, but not within physiological
constraints. However, slip-links that include motor activity are far more
effective at organizing the entire chromosome over all length-scales. The
persistence of motor slip-links at physiological densities can generate large,
nested loops and drive them into the bulk of the DNA. Finally, our model with
motor slip-links can quantitatively account for the rapid arm--arm alignment of
chromosomal arms observed in vivo.

  criteria",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the currently popular Eulerian vortex identification criteria,
including the Q criterion, the Delta criterion and the Lambda_ci criterion, are
based on the analysis of the velocity gradient tensor. More specifically, these
criteria are exclusively determined by the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient
tensor or the related invariants and thereby can be regarded as
eigenvalue-based criteria. However, these criteria have been found to be
plagued with two shortcomings: (1) these criteria fail to identify the swirl
axis or orientation; (2) these criteria are prone to contamination by shearing.
In this paper, an alternative eigenvector-based definition of Rortex is
introduced. The real eigenvector of the velocity gradient tensor is used to
define the direction of Rortex as the possible axis of the local fluid
rotation, and the rotational strength obtained in the plane perpendicular to
the possible local axis is defined as the magnitude of Rortex. This alternative
definition is mathematically equivalent to our previous one but allows a much
more efficient implementation. Furthermore, a complete and systematic
interpretation of scalar, vector and tensor versions of Rortex is presented to
provide a unified and clear characterization of the instantaneous local rigidly
rotation. By relying on the tensor interpretation of Rortex, a new
decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is proposed to shed light on the
analytical relations between Rortex and eigenvalue-based criteria. It can be
observed that shearing always manifests its effect on the imaginary part of the
complex eigenvalues and consequently contaminates eigenvalue-based criteria,
while Rortex can exclude the shearing contamination and accurately quantify the
local rotational strength.

and the geometry of the fibres $U_s:=\{ y:E(s,y) \wedge y \notin C \}$ where
$s$ is a non-constant element. We show that certain types of predimension
inequalities imply strong minimality and geometric triviality of $U_s$.
Moreover, the induced structure on the Cartesian powers of $U_s$ is given by
special subvarieties. In particular, since the $j$-function satisfies an
Ax-Schanuel inequality of the required form (due to Pila and Tsimerman),
applying our results to the $j$-function we recover a theorem of Freitag and
Scanlon stating that the differential equation of $j$ defines a strongly
minimal set with trivial geometry.

$j$-reducts of differentially closed fields. Let $E_j(x,y)$ be the

all strongly minimal sets are geometrically trivial or non-orthogonal to $C$.
Our proof is based on the Ax-Schanuel theorem and a matching Existential
Closedness statement which asserts that systems of equations in terms of $E_j$
have solutions in $\mathsf{K}$ unless having a solution contradicts
Ax-Schanuel.

events are well suited for optical flow, but conventional optical flow (OF)
algorithms are not well matched to the event stream data. This paper proposes
an event-driven OF algorithm called adaptive block-matching optical flow
(ABMOF). ABMOF uses time slices of accumulated DVS events. The time slices are
adaptively rotated based on the input events and OF results. Compared with
other methods such as gradient-based OF, ABMOF can efficiently be implemented
in compact logic circuits. Results show that ABMOF achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional standards such as Lucas-Kanade (LK). The main contributions of
our paper are new adaptive time-slice rotation methods that ensure the
generated slices have sufficient features for matching,including a feedback
mechanism that controls the generated slices to have average slice displacement
within the block search range. An LK method using our adapted slices is also
implemented. The ABMOF accuracy is compared with this LK method on natural
scene data including sparse and dense texture, high dynamic range, and fast
motion exceeding 30,000 pixels per second.The paper dataset and source code are

those using optimistic concurrency control, is a challenging task. The main
difficulty is in reasoning about the view of the memory obtained by the
threads, because as they execute, threads observe different fragments of memory
from different points in time. Until today, every linearizability proof has
tackled this challenge from scratch.
  We present a unifying proof argument for the correctness of unsynchronized
traversals, and apply it to prove the linearizability of several highly
concurrent search data structures, including an optimistic self-balancing
binary search tree, the Lazy List and a lock-free skip list. Our framework
harnesses {\em sequential reasoning} about the view of a thread, considering
the thread as if it traverses the data structure without interference from
other operations. Our key contribution is showing that properties of
reachability along search paths can be deduced for concurrent traversals from
such interference-free traversals, when certain intuitive conditions are met.
Basing the correctness of traversals on such \emph{local view arguments}
greatly simplifies linearizability proofs.
  To apply our framework, the user proves that the data structure satisfies two
conditions: (1) acyclicity of the order on memory, even when it is considered
across intermediate memory states, and (2) preservation of search paths to
locations modified by interfering writes. Establishing the conditions, as well
as the full linearizability proof utilizing our proof argument, reduces to
simple concurrent reasoning. The result is a clear and comprehensible
correctness proof, and elucidates common patterns underlying several existing
data structures.

independently, Okhotin) proved a non-erasing variant of CST for grammars in
Double Greibach Normal Form. In all these CST statements, however, the size of
the Dyck alphabet $\Omega$ depends on the grammar size for $L$. In the Stanley
variant of the CST, $|\Omega|$ only depends on $|\Sigma|$ and not on the
grammar, but the homomorphism erases many more symbols than in the other
versions of CST; also, the regular language $R$ is strictly locally testable

construction, $|\Omega|$ is polynomial in $|\Sigma|$, namely
$O(|\Sigma|^{46})$, and the regular language $R$ is strictly locally testable.
Using a recent generalization of Medvedev's homomorphic characterization of

of finite element approximations is shown to exhibit strong convergence to the
unique weak solution of the model. Assuming that the material parameters
featuring in the model are Lipschitz-continuous, and assuming that the weak
solution has additional regularity, the sequence of finite element
approximations is shown to converge with a rate. An iterative algorithm is
constructed for the solution of the system of nonlinear algebraic equations
that arises from the finite element approximation. An appealing feature of the
iterative algorithm is that it decouples the monotone and linear elastic parts
of the nonlinearity in the model. In particular, our choice of piecewise
constant approximation for the stress tensor (and continuous piecewise linear
approximation for the displacement) allows us to compute the monotone part of
the nonlinearity by solving an algebraic system with $d(d+1)/2$ unknowns
independently on each element in the subdivision of the computational domain.

$t$-distributions as their (low-dimensional) stationary distributions. That
autoregressions with such stationary distributions exist is not immediate. Our
formulation implies that the conditional mean of each component model is a
linear function of past observations and the conditional variance is also time
varying. Compared to previous mixture autoregressive models our model may
therefore be useful in applications where the data exhibits rather strong

advantage that conditions for stationarity and ergodicity are always met and

main body. On the other hand, the number of new cluster candidates per time
unit as a function of time results noticeably different to the intrinsic SMC
cluster frequency (CF), which should not be the case if these new detections
were genuine physical systems. We additionally found that the SMC CF varies
spatially, in such a way that it resembles an outside-in process coupled with
the effects of a relatively recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.

squeezing and decoherence of a polarization entangled photon pair by a

is negligible, the inelastic $\Lambda \Xi$, $\Sigma \Xi$, and $\Lambda \Xi
(1530)$ channels via the $K$ meson exchange give the attraction of the $N
\Omega ( {}^{5}S_{2} )$ interaction to the same level with the elastic meson
exchanges. Although the elimination of these channels induces the energy
dependence of the single-channel $N \Omega$ interaction, this effect is not
significant. With the present model parameters fitted to reproduce the
scattering length of the HAL QCD result of the nearly physical quark masses, we
obtain the $N \Omega ( {}^{5}S_{2} )$ quasibound state with its eigenenergy
$2611.3 - 0.7 i$ MeV, which corresponds to the binding energy $0.1$ MeV and
width $1.5$ MeV for the decay to the $\Lambda \Xi$ and $\Sigma \Xi$ channels.
From the analysis of the spatial structure and the compositeness, the
quasibound state is shown to be the molecular state of $N\Omega$. We also
construct an equivalent local potential for the $N \Omega ( {}^{5}S_{2} )$
system which is useful for various applications.

vision. They are at the heart of the enormous recent progress in artificial

neuroscience. They have had many successes but also have several limitations
and there is limited understanding of their inner workings. At present Deep
Nets perform very well on specific visual tasks with benchmark datasets but
they are much less general purpose, flexible, and adaptive than the human
visual system. We argue that Deep Nets in their current form are unlikely to be
able to overcome the fundamental problem of computer vision, namely how to deal
with the combinatorial explosion, caused by the enormous complexity of natural
images, and obtain the rich understanding of visual scenes that the human
visual achieves. We argue that this combinatorial explosion takes us into a
regime where ""big data is not enough"" and where we need to rethink our methods
for benchmarking performance and evaluating vision algorithms. We stress that,
as vision algorithms are increasingly used in real world applications, that
performance evaluation is not merely an academic exercise but has important
consequences in the real world. It is impractical to review the entire Deep Net
literature so we restrict ourselves to a limited range of topics and references

general-purpose paradigm for classical computing using transistor-free logic.
An elementary QCA device called a ""cell"" is made from a system of coupled
quantum dots with a few mobile charges. The cell's charge configuration encodes
a bit, and quantum charge tunneling within a cell enables device switching.
Arrays of cells networked locally via the electrostatic field form QCA
circuits, which mix logic, memory and interconnect. A molecular QCA
implementation promises ultra-high device densities, high switching speeds, and
room-temperature operation. We propose a novel approach to the technical
challenge of transducing bits from larger conventional devices to nanoscale QCA
molecules. This signal transduction begins with lithographically-formed
electrodes placed on the device plane. A voltage applied across these
electrodes establishes an in-plane electric field, which selects a bit packet
on a large QCA input circuit. A typical QCA binary wire may be used to transmit
a smaller bit packet of a size more suitable for processing from this input to
other QCA circuitry. In contrast to previous concepts for bit inputs to
molecular QCA, this approach requires neither special QCA cells with fixed
states nor nanoelectrodes which establish fields with single-electron
specificity. A brief overview of the QCA paradigm is given. Proof-of-principle
simulation results are shown, demonstrating the input concept in circuits made
from two-dot QCA cells. Importantly, this concept for bit inputs to molecular
QCA may enable solutions to or provide insights into other challenges to the

switching, the read-out of molecular QCA states, and the layout of molecular

typically measured by suppression, and also predicted by various energy loss
models. A crucial test of different energy loss mechanisms is how the energy
loss depends on the length of traversed medium (so-called path-length
dependence). The upcoming experimental results will allow to, at least in
principle, for the first time, clearly observe how the energy loss changes with
the size of the medium, in particular, by comparing already available $Pb+Pb$
measurements with now upcoming $Xe+Xe$ data at the LHC. However, in practice,
to actually perform such test, it becomes crucial to chose an optimal
observable. With respect to this, a ratio of observed suppression for the two
systems may seem a natural (and frequently mentioned) choice. We, however, show
that extracting the path-length dependence from this observable would not be
possible. We here provide an analytical derivation based on simple scaling
arguments, as well as detailed numerical calculations based on our advanced
energy loss framework, showing that a different observable is suitable for this
purpose. We call this observable path-length sensitive suppression ratio
($R_L^{AB}$) and provide our predictions before experimental data become
available. This predictions also clearly show that this observable will allow a
simple comparison of the related theoretical models with the experimental data,
and consequently to distinguish between different (underlying) energy loss
mechanisms, which is in turn crucial for understanding properties of created
QCD medium.

visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) within a sliding-window filtering
framework and design an efficient, lightweight, robocentric visual-inertial
odometry (R-VIO) algorithm for consistent motion tracking even in challenging
environments using only a monocular camera and a 6-axis IMU. The key idea is to
deliberately reformulate the VINS with respect to a moving local frame, rather
than a fixed global frame of reference as in the standard world-centric VINS,
in order to obtain relative motion estimates of higher accuracy for updating
global poses. As an immediate advantage of this robocentric formulation, the
proposed R-VIO can start from an arbitrary pose, without the need to align the
initial orientation with the global gravitational direction. More importantly,
we analytically show that the linearized robocentric VINS does not undergo the
observability mismatch issue as in the standard world-centric counterpart which
was identified in the literature as the main cause of estimation inconsistency.
Additionally, we investigate in-depth the special motions that degrade the
performance in the world-centric formulation and show that such degenerate
cases can be easily compensated in the proposed robocentric formulation,
without resorting to additional sensors as in the world-centric formulation,
thus leading to better robustness. The proposed R-VIO algorithm has been
extensively tested through both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world
experiments with different sensor platforms navigating in different
environments, and shown to achieve better (or competitive at least) performance
than the state-of-the-art VINS, in terms of consistency, accuracy and
efficiency.

model selects semantically unrelated words with respect to the source content

constructed training data, where summaries can be unrelated to the source

regularize the learning objective to alleviate the effect of the problem. In
addition, we propose a practical human evaluation method to address the problem

the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms almost all the

characterization provided by an MCP is severely limited by cross-talk between
its microchannels, rendering MCP and II ill-suited for autocorrelation
measurements. Here we present a cross-talk subtraction method experimentally
exemplified for an I-sCMOS based measurement of pseudo-thermal light
second-order intensity autocorrelation function at the single- photon level.
The method merely requires a dark counts measurement for calibration. A
reference cross- correlation measurement certifies the cross-talk subtraction.
While remaining universal for MCP applications, the presented cross-talk
subtraction in particular simplifies quantum optical setups. With the
possibility of autocorrelation measurement the signal needs no longer to be
divided into two camera regions for a cross- correlation measurement, reducing
the experimental setup complexity and increasing at least twofold the

times $t=1,2,3,\ldots$ a random box is identified; the probability of choosing
box~$i$ is~$p_i$. If a player has at least one counter in the chosen box, she
removes one counter from it; otherwise she takes no action. The winner is the
first player to remove all her counters. The game so described may be modified
so that each player simultaneously, but independently, identifies a box at
random.
  This paper analyses this deceptively simple game, which has apparently not
been studied in the literature. Some analytical and numerical results are then
presented, followed by some challenges for further work.

ELM assigning the different weights to the different samples improves the

differences between samples within the same categories. We measure the
importance of the documents by the sample information entropy, and generate
cost-sensitive matrix and factor based on the document importance, then embed
the cost-sensitive weighted ELM into the AdaBoost.M1 framework seamlessly.
Vector space model(VSM) text representation produces the high dimensions and

develop a text classification framework combining the word vector and AE1-WELM.

traditional image segmentation, poses several unique challenges. 360-degree
photospheres captured from vehicles are an effective way to capture a large
number of images, but this data presents difficult-to-model warping and
stitching artifacts. In addition, each pixel can belong to multiple facade
elements, and different facade elements (e.g., window, balcony, sill, etc.) are
correlated and vary wildly in their characteristics. In this paper, we propose
three network architectures of varying complexity to achieve multilabel
semantic segmentation of facade images while exploiting their unique
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a MULTIFACSEGNET architecture to
assign multiple labels to each pixel, a SEPARABLE architecture as a low-rank
formulation that encourages extraction of rectangular elements, and a
COMPATIBILITY network that simultaneously seeks segmentation across facade
element types allowing the network to 'see' intermediate output probabilities
of the various facade element classes. Our results on benchmark datasets show
significant improvements over existing facade segmentation approaches for the
typical facade elements. For example, on one commonly used dataset, the
accuracy scores for window(the most important architectural element) increases
from 0.91 to 0.97 percent compared to the best competing method, and comparable
improvements on other element types.

as a micro-expression. Exploration of automatic facial micro-expression
recognition systems is relatively new in the computer vision domain. This is
due to the difficulty in implementing optimal feature extraction methods to
cope with the subtlety and brief motion characteristics of the expression. Most
of the existing approaches extract the subtle facial movements based on
hand-crafted features. In this paper, we address the micro-expression
recognition task with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which
well integrates the features extracted from each video. A new feature
descriptor, Optical Flow Features from Apex frame Network (OFF-ApexNet) is
introduced. This feature descriptor combines the optical ow guided context with
the CNN. Firstly, we obtain the location of the apex frame from each video
sequence as it portrays the highest intensity of facial motion among all
frames. Then, the optical ow information are attained from the apex frame and a
reference frame (i.e., onset frame). Finally, the optical flow features are fed
into a pre-designed CNN model for further feature enhancement as well as to
carry out the expression classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of
OFF-ApexNet, comprehensive evaluations are conducted on three public
spontaneous micro-expression datasets (i.e., SMIC, CASME II and SAMM). The
promising recognition result suggests that the proposed method can optimally
describe the significant micro-expression details. In particular, we report
that, in a multi-database with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation
experimental protocol, the recognition performance reaches 74.60% of
recognition accuracy and F-measure of 71.04%. We also note that this is the
first work that performs cross-dataset validation on three databases in this
