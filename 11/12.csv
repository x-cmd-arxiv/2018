invariant calculated in the Regge-Wheeler and Easy gauges for circular orbits
in a Schwarzschild background, utilizing the regularization framework
introduced by Pound, Merlin, and Barack. The numerical calculation is performed
in the frequency domain and requires the integration of a single second-order

numerical methods. A sufficiently high-order, analytic expansion of the
Detweiler-Whiting singular field is gauge-transformed to both the Regge-Wheeler

agree to a relative accuracy of $10^{-15}$ for an orbital radius of $r_0=6M$

$w$-well-covered is a vector space, denoted as $WCW(G).$ Deciding whether an
input graph $G$ is well-covered is co-NP-complete. Therefore, finding $WCW(G)$
is co-NP-hard. A generating subgraph of a graph $G$ is an induced complete
bipartite subgraph $B$ of $G$ on vertex sets of bipartition $B_{X}$ and
$B_{Y}$, such that each of $S \cup B_{X}$ and $S \cup B_{Y}$ is a maximal

then $w(B_{X})=w(B_{Y})$ for every weight function $w \in WCW(G)$. Therefore,
generating subgraphs play an important role in finding $WCW(G)$. The decision
problem whether a subgraph of an input graph is generating is known to be
NP-complete. In this article, we prove NP-completeness of the problem for

$WCW(G)$ when $G$ does not contain cycles of lengths 3, 4, 5, and 7.

analysis, including lesion growth kinetic modeling in clinical trials and
machine learning of radiomic features. Manual segmentation is laborious, and
impractical for large-scale use. For routine clinical use, and in clinical
trials that apply the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST),
clinicians typically outline the boundaries of a lesion on a single slice to
extract diameter measurements. In this work, we have collected a large-scale
database, named LesionVis, with pixel-wise manual 2D lesion delineations on the
RECIST-slices. To extend the 2D segmentations to 3D, we propose a volumetric
progressive lesion segmentation (PLS) algorithm to automatically segment the 3D
lesion volume from 2D delineations using a scale-invariant and boundary-aware
deep convolutional network (SIBA-Net). The SIBA-Net copes with the size
transition of a lesion when the PLS progresses from the RECIST-slice to the
edge-slices, as well as when performing longitudinal assessment of lesions
whose size change over multiple time points. The proposed PLS-SiBA-Net (P-SiBA)
approach is assessed on the lung lesion cases from LesionVis. Our experimental
results demonstrate that the P-SiBA approach achieves mean Dice similarity
coefficients (DSC) of 0.81, which significantly improves 3D segmentation
accuracy compared with the approaches proposed previously (highest mean DSC at
0.78 on LesionVis). In summary, by leveraging the limited 2D delineations on
the RECIST-slices, P-SiBA is an effective semi-supervised approach to produce
accurate lesion segmentations in 3D.

learning graph node embedding by successfully utilizing graph connectivity
structure. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end Structure-Aware
Convolutional Network (SACN) that takes the benefit of GCN and ConvE together.
SACN consists of an encoder of a weighted graph convolutional network (WGCN),
and a decoder of a convolutional network called Conv-TransE. WGCN utilizes
knowledge graph node structure, node attributes and edge relation types. It has
learnable weights that adapt the amount of information from neighbors used in
local aggregation, leading to more accurate embeddings of graph nodes. Node
attributes in the graph are represented as additional nodes in the WGCN. The
decoder Conv-TransE enables the state-of-the-art ConvE to be translational

vector-valued modular form for $\rho$ whose component functions have algebraic
Fourier coefficients then the sequence of the denominators of the Fourier

computing an explicit basis for $M(\rho)$ as a $M(\Gamma_{0}(2))$-module. We
give formulas for the component functions of a minimal weight vector-valued

in a statistical learning setting, by empirical risk minimization over model
classes of functions in tree-based tensor format. These are particular classes
of rank-structured functions that can be seen as deep neural networks with a
sparse architecture related to the tree and multilinear activation functions.
For learning in a given model class, we exploit the fact that tree-based tensor
formats are multilinear models and recast the problem of risk minimization over
a nonlinear set into a succession of learning problems with linear models.
Suitable changes of representation yield numerically stable learning problems
and allow to exploit sparsity. For high-dimensional problems or when only a
small data set is available, the selection of a good model class is a critical
issue. For a given tree, the selection of the tuple of tree-based ranks that
minimize the risk is a combinatorial problem. Here, we propose a rank
adaptation strategy which provides in practice a good convergence of the risk
as a function of the model class complexity. Finding a good tree is also a
combinatorial problem, which can be related to the choice of a particular
sparse architecture for deep neural networks. Here, we propose a stochastic
algorithm for minimizing the complexity of the representation of a given
function over a class of trees with a given arity, allowing changes in the
topology of the tree. This tree optimization algorithm is then included in a
learning scheme that successively adapts the tree and the corresponding
tree-based ranks. Contrary to classical learning algorithms for nonlinear model
classes, the proposed algorithms are numerically stable, reliable, and require
only a low level expertise of the user.

provides not only an X-ray absorption image, but also additionally a
differential phase image and a dark-field image. The dark-field image is
related to small angle scattering and has an interesting property when canning
oriented structures: the recorded signal depends on the relative orientation of
the structure in the imaging system. Exactly this property allows to draw
conclusions about the orientation and to reconstruct the structure. However,
the reconstruction is a complex, non-trivial challenge. A lot of research was
conducted towards this goal in the last years and several reconstruction
algorithms were proposed. A key step of the reconstruction algorithm is the
inversion of a forward projection model. Up until now, only 2-D projection
models are available, with effectively limit the scanning trajectory to a 2-D
plane. To obtain true 3-D information, this limitation requires to combine
several 2-D scans, which leads to quite complex, impractical acquisitions
schemes. Furthermore, it is not possible with these models to use 3-D
trajectories that might allow simpler protocols, like for example a helical
trajectory. To address these limitations, we propose in this work a very
general 3-D projection model. Our projection model defines the dark-field
signal dependent on an arbitrarily chosen ray and sensitivity direction. We
derive the projection model under the assumption that the observed scatter
distribution has a Gaussian shape. We theoretically show the consistency of our
model with more constrained existing 2-D models. Furthermore, we experimentally
show the compatibility of our model with dark-field measurements of two
matchsticks. We believe that this 3-D projection model is an important step
towards more flexible trajectories and imaging protocols that are much better
applicable in practice.

Further, the problem and its formulation are proposed for the time-interval

planning example for modular home-building is described. Here, the main
objective function consists in a balance between production of the typical
building modules (details) and the assembly processes of the building(s) (by
several teams). The assembly plan has to be modified to satisfy the balance
requirements. The solving framework is based on the following: (i) clustering
of initial set of modular detail types to obtain about ten basic detail types
that correspond to main manufacturing conveyors; (ii) designing a preliminary
plan of assembly for buildings; (iii) detection of unbalanced time periods,
(iv) modification of the planning solution to improve the schedule balance. The

other applications (supply chain management, information transmission systems)

existing machine learning models are designed in a way to always generate a

""quickly"", in different macroeconomic states, companies adjust their capital
structure to their leverage targets. This study extends the empirical research
on the topic of capital structure by focusing on a quantile regression method
to investigate the behavior of firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic
factors across all quantiles of distribution of leverage (book leverage and
market leverage). Therefore, depending on a partial adjustment model, we find
that the adjustment speed fluctuated in different stages of book versus market
leverage. Furthermore, while macroeconomic states change, we detect clear
differentiations of the contribution and the effects of the firm-specific and
the macroeconomic variables between market leverage and book leverage debt
ratios. Consequently, we deduce that across different macroeconomic states the
nature and maturity of borrowing influence the persistence and endurance of the
relation between determinants and borrowing.

campaigns across multiple publishers affiliated to an RTB ad exchange. While
driving multiple campaigns for mobile app install ads via RTB, the bidder
typically has to: (i) maintain each campaign's efficiency (i.e., meet
advertiser's target cost-per-install), (ii) be sensitive to advertiser's
budget, and (iii) make profit after payouts to the ad exchange. In this
process, there is a sense of delayed rewards for the bidder's actions; the
exchange charges the bidder right after the ad is shown, but the bidder gets to
know about resultant installs after considerable delay. This makes it
challenging for the bidder to decide beforehand the bid (and corresponding cost
charged to advertiser) for each ad display opportunity. To jointly handle the
objectives mentioned above, we propose a state space based policy which decides
the exchange bid and advertiser cost for each opportunity. The state space
captures the current efficiency, budget utilization and profit. The policy
based on this state space is trained on past decisions and outcomes via a novel
Q-learning algorithm which accounts for the delay in install notifications. In
our experiments based on data from app install campaigns managed by Yahoo's
Gemini advertising platform, the Q-learning based policy led to a significant
increase in the profit and number of efficient campaigns.

To detect unmodeled and unexpected signals we need to be able to separate them
from instrumental noise artifacts, or glitches. Glitches are a regular feature
in the data from ground based laser interferometers, and they were also seen in
data from the LISA Pathfinder mission. In contrast to the situation on ground,
we will not have the luxury of having multiple independent detectors to help
separate unmodeled signals from glitches, and new techniques have to be
developed. Here we show that unmodeled gravitational wave bursts can be
detected with LISA by leveraging the different way in which instrument glitches
and gravitational wave bursts imprint themselves in the time-delay
interferometery data channels. We show that for signals with periods longer
than the light travel time between the spacecraft, the ""breathing mode"" or
Sagnac data combination is key to detection. Conversely, for short period
signals it is the time of arrival at each spacecraft that aids separation. We
investigate the conditions under which we can distinguish the origin of signals

of the MPCs enables the possibility of localization with extraordinary accuracy
even with limited bandwidth. The specular MPC parameters along with the
parameters of the noise and the dense multipath component (DMC) are tracked
using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which enables to preserve the
distance-related phase changes of the MPC complex amplitudes. The DMC comprises
all non-resolvable MPCs, which occur due to finite measurement aperture. The
estimation of the DMC parameters enhances the estimation quality of the
specular MPCs and therefore also the quality of localization and mapping. The
estimated MPC propagation distances are subsequently used as input to a
distance-based localization and mapping algorithm. This algorithm does not need
prior knowledge about the surrounding environment and base station position.
The performance is demonstrated with real radio-channel measurements using an
antenna array with 128 ports at the base station side and a standard cellular

material for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. Its functional
efficiency, however, is strongly affected by defect-related in-gap states that
open up extrinsic decay channels and modify relaxation timescales. As a
consequence, almost every ZnO sample behaves differently, leading to
irreproducible or even contradicting observations. Here, a complementary set of
time-resolved spectroscopies is applied to two ZnO samples of different defect
density to disentangle the competing contributions of charge carriers,
excitons, and defects to the non-equilibrium dynamics after photoexcitation:
Time-resolved photoluminescence, excited state transmission, and electronic sum
frequency generation. Remarkably, defects affect the transient optical
properties of ZnO across more than eight orders of magnitude in time, starting
with photodepletion of normally occupied defect states on femtosecond
timescales, followed by the competition of free exciton emission and exciton
trapping at defect sites within picoseconds, photoluminescence of defect-bound
and free excitons on nanosecond timescales, and deeply trapped holes with
microsecond lifetimes. These findings do not only provide the first
comprehensive picture of charge and exciton relaxation pathways in ZnO, but
also uncover the microscopic origin of previous conflicting observations in
this challenging material and thereby offer means of overcoming its
difficulties.

due to the convolution of the simulation noise and the input noise, the

show how the total required effort can be reduced from an order bigger than the

into two sub-clusters surrounded by a lower density halo. We fit the empirical

mechanism is difficult to explain. We propose an interpretable multi-stage PCA
method to achieve the same goal and use handwritten digit images synthesis as
an illustrative example. First, we derive principal-component-analysis-based
(PCA-based) transform kernels at each stage based on the covariance of its
inputs. This results in a sequence of transforms that convert input images of
correlated pixels to spectral vectors of uncorrelated components. In other
words, it is a whitening process. Then, we can synthesize an image based on
random vectors and multi-stage transform kernels through a coloring process.
The generative model is a feedforward (FF) design since no BP is used in model
parameter determination. Its design complexity is significantly lower, and the
whole design process is explainable. Finally, we design an FF generative model
using the MNIST dataset, compare synthesis results with those obtained by
state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods, and show that the proposed generative

with the positions listed in the MSX, WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia catalogs. Starting
from an MSX position it is, in general, simple to match 2MASS and WISE
counterparts. However, in order to obtain a Gaia match to the MSX source it is
required to use a two-step approach due to the large number of nearby
candidates and low initial positional accuracy of the MSX data. We show that
the closest comparable position to the SiO maser in our limited sample never is
the MSX position. When a plausible source with a characteristic signature of an
evolved star with a circumstellar shell can be found in the area, the best
indicator of the maser position is provided by the Gaia position, with the
2MASS position being second-best. Typical positional offsets from all catalogs
to the SiO masers are reported.

does not make sense and therefore it must be replaced by a control that is
localized outside the open set where the PDE is solved. Having learned from the
above mentioned result, in this paper we introduce a new class of source
identification and optimal control problems where the source/control is located
outside the observation domain where the PDE is satisfied. The classical
diffusion models lack this flexibility as they assume that the source/control

locality property of the underlying operators. We use the nonlocality of the
fractional operator to create a framework that now allows placing a
source/control outside the observation domain. We consider the Dirichlet, Robin
and Neumann source identification or optimal control problems. These problems
require dealing with the nonlocal normal derivative (that we shall call
interaction operator). We create a functional analytic framework and show
well-posedness and derive the first order optimality conditions for these
problems. We introduce a new approach to approximate, with convergence rate,
the Dirichlet problem with nonzero exterior condition. The numerical examples
confirm our theoretical findings and illustrate the practicality of our

mapping out the space of solutions for a given task. We observe in the case of
Cart-Pole the surprising finding that good agents make different decisions
despite learning similar representations, whereas bad agents make similar (bad)
decisions while learning dissimilar representations. Linearly interpolating
between the latent embeddings for a good agent and a bad agent yields an agent

performance can be tuned according to the coefficient of interpolation. Linear
extrapolation in the latent space also results in performance boosts, up to a

between model and observed secondary spectrum as a goodness-of-fit metric. Both
methods show that the half-power width of $B(\theta)$ deviates from the
expected dependence $\propto \nu^{-a}$, where $\nu$ is the observing frequency
. Our estimates of $a$ have moderately large uncertainties but imply $a
\lesssim1.8$, and so are inconsistent with the expected $a = 2.0$ for plasma

$B(\theta)$ cuts off more steeply than predicted for Kolmogorov turbulence.
Ultimately, we conclude that the underlying physics of the broadening mechanism

engineering, the emerging technology capable of controlling the physio-chemical

strains are set by materials' elasticity limits, it is of great importance to
suppress the occurrence of any inelastic deformations and failure, and thereby
the fundamental knowledge on fracture behavior at nanoscale is highly required.
The conventional Weibull theory, which has been widely used for last a few
decades to explain the failure statistics of brittle bulk materials, has a
limitation to be directly applied to the samples of nanometer dimensions
because the baseline assumption on statistical equivalence becomes intractable
for small samples. In this study, we suggest an integrated equation presenting
the sample size effect on fracture strength for brittle nanomaterials by
further considering the confinement of the flaw size distribution. This new
approach is applicable to any homogeneous brittle nanomaterials whose failure
is governed by linear elastic fracture mechanics, and shows good agreement with
experimental data collected from literatures. We expect that this theoretical
study offers new guideline to employ brittle nanomaterials in designing and

the necessity of the random effect may not be properly assessed due to the dual
role of the random effect; it affects both the marginal distribution of the

an individual over time. In line with such observations, we explain that one

explore the new-physics scenarios in the CP-violating decays of the B mesons.
To achieve the required particle identification performances, the
Time-of-propagation counter has been installed in the central barrel region.
This unique device consists in 16 bars of fused silica that act simultaneously
as radiator and as light guide for the Cerenkov light. Unlike in the DIRC
detectors, the PID information is mostly extracted measuring the time of
propagation of the Cherenkov light in the radiator rather than its purely
geometrical patterns. We will present here a general overview of the status of
the TOP counter, including the estimation of the time resolution, the
calibration strategies and performances, and the first result obtained in the
commissioning phase, both using cosmic rays and $e^+e^-$ collision events
collected during the {\it phase II} pilot run of the Belle II experiment. These
are the first measurements of the particle identification performances of a
time-of-propagation detector in a full HEP experimental setup.

  Pyramid Network","AAAI19",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature pyramids are widely exploited by both the state-of-the-art one-stage
object detectors (e.g., DSSD, RetinaNet, RefineDet) and the two-stage object
detectors (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DetNet) to alleviate the problem arising from
scale variation across object instances. Although these object detectors with
feature pyramids achieve encouraging results, they have some limitations due to
that they only simply construct the feature pyramid according to the inherent
multi-scale, pyramidal architecture of the backbones which are actually
designed for object classification task. Newly, in this work, we present a
method called Multi-Level Feature Pyramid Network (MLFPN) to construct more
effective feature pyramids for detecting objects of different scales. First, we
fuse multi-level features (i.e. multiple layers) extracted by backbone as the
base feature. Second, we feed the base feature into a block of alternating
joint Thinned U-shape Modules and Feature Fusion Modules and exploit the
decoder layers of each u-shape module as the features for detecting objects.
Finally, we gather up the decoder layers with equivalent scales (sizes) to
develop a feature pyramid for object detection, in which every feature map
consists of the layers (features) from multiple levels. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed MLFPN, we design and train a powerful end-to-end
one-stage object detector we call M2Det by integrating it into the architecture
of SSD, which gets better detection performance than state-of-the-art one-stage
detectors. Specifically, on MS-COCO benchmark, M2Det achieves AP of 41.0 at
speed of 11.8 FPS with single-scale inference strategy and AP of 44.2 with
multi-scale inference strategy, which is the new state-of-the-art results among
one-stage detectors. The code will be made available on

community partition, which is based on inherent network structure information.
The introduced optimization approach utilizes the new network centrality
measure of both links and vertices to construct the key affinity description of
the given network, where the direct similarities between graph nodes or nodal
features are not available to obtain the classical affinity matrix. Indeed,
such calculated network centrality information presents the essential structure
of network, hence, the proper measure for detecting network communities, which
also introduces a `confidence' criterion for referencing new labeled benchmark
nodes. For the resulted challenging combinatorial optimization problem of graph
clustering, the proposed optimization method iteratively employs an efficient
convex optimization algorithm which is developed based under a new variational
perspective of primal and dual. Experiments over both artificial and real-world
network datasets demonstrate that the proposed optimization strategy of
community detection significantly improves result accuracy and outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability.

models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing
challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning
Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment
dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent
space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict
the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent
dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components.
Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that we name
latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous
control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards,
which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning
with learned models. PlaNet uses substantially fewer episodes and reaches final
performance close to and sometimes higher than strong model-free algorithms.

(CNNs) are used to constrain theta and phi of disk galaxies under RPS. We first
train a CNN by using ~10^5 synthesized images of gaseous distributions of the
galaxies from numerous RPS models with different theta and phi. We then apply
the trained CNN to a new test RPS model to predict theta and phi. The
similarity between the correct and predicted theta and $\phi$ is measured by
cosine similarity (cos-Theta) with cos-Theta =1 being perfectly accurate
prediction. We show that the average cos-Theta among test models is ~0.95,
which means that theta and phi can be constrained well by applying the CNN to
the spatial distributions of their gas. This result suggests that if the ICM is
in hydrostatic equilibrium (thus not moving), the 3D orbit of a disk galaxy
within its host cluster can be constrained by the spatial distribution of the
gas being stripped by RPS. We discuss the applications of the method to HI
surveys such as WALLABY and SKA projects.

aperture even in the absence of any magnetic nonlinearities. This was observed
in tracking for LEP and the Future Circular $e^+e^-$ Collider (FCC-ee). Here we
describe a new mechanism of instability created by modulation of the particle
energy at the double betatron frequency by synchrotron radiation in the
quadrupoles. Energy modulation varies transverse focusing strength at the same
frequency and creates a parametric resonance of the betatron oscillations with
unusual properties. It occurs at arbitrary betatron frequency (the resonant
detuning is always zero) and the magnitude of the parameter modulation of the
betatron oscillation (strength of the resonance driving term) depends on the
oscillation amplitude. Equilibrium between the radiation damping and the
resonant excitation gives the boundary of the stable motion. Starting from 6d
equations of motion we derive and solve the relevant differential equation
describing the resonance, and show good agreement between analytical results

better energy resolution. The reconstructed to true energy ratio shows
comparable or less dependence on true energy, hadronic energy fractions, and
interaction modes. The regression CNN also shows smaller systematic
uncertainties from the simulation of neutrino interactions. The proposed energy

poorly understood. In this study, antiferromagnet-based spintronic
functionality is demonstrated by combining unique characteristics of the
isospin state in Sr2IrO4. Based on magnetic and transport measurements, large
and highly anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is obtained by manipulating the
antiferromagnetic isospin domains. First-principles calculations suggest that
electrons whose isospin directions are strongly coupled to in-plane net
magnetic moment encounter the isospin mismatch when moving across
antiferromagnetic domain boundaries, which generates a high resistance state.
By rotating a magnetic field that aligns in-plane net moments and removes
domain boundaries, the macroscopically-ordered isospins govern dynamic
transport through the system, which leads to the extremely angle-sensitive AMR.
As with this work that establishes a link between isospins and magnetotransport
in strongly spin-orbit-coupled AFM Sr2IrO4, the peculiar AMR effect provides a
beneficial foundation for fundamental and applied research on AFM spintronics.

achieving error-free fault tolerance often incurs substantial performance
overhead. We present AF-Stream, a distributed stream processing system that
addresses the trade-off between performance and accuracy in fault tolerance.
AF-Stream builds on a notion called approximate fault tolerance, whose idea is
to mitigate backup overhead by adaptively issuing backups, while ensuring that
the errors upon failures are bounded with theoretical guarantees. Specifically,
AF-Stream allows users to specify bounds on both the state divergence and the
loss of non-backup streaming items. It issues state and item backups only when
the bounds are reached. Our AF-Stream design provides an extensible programming
model for incorporating general streaming algorithms as well as exports only
few threshold parameters for configuring approximation fault tolerance.
Furthermore, we formally prove that AF-Stream preserves high algorithm-specific
accuracy of streaming algorithms, and in particular the convergence guarantees
of online learning. Experiments show that AF-Stream maintains high performance
(compared to no fault tolerance) and high accuracy after multiple failures
(compared to no failures) under various streaming algorithms.

likelihood estimators, CV-TMLE [Zheng:2010aa], has a distinct advantage over
TMLE [Laan:2006aa] in that one less condition is required of CV-TMLE in order
to achieve asymptotic efficiency in the nonparametric or semiparametric
settings. CV-TMLE as originally formulated, consists of averaging usually 10
(for 10-fold cross-validation) parameter estimates, each of which is performed
on a validation set separate from where the initial fit was trained. The
targeting step is usually performed as a pooled regression over all validation
folds but in each fold, we separately evaluate any means as well as the
parameter estimate. One nice thing about CV-TMLE, is that we average 10 plug-in
estimates so the plug-in quality of preserving the natural parameter bounds is
respected. Our adjustment of this procedure also preserves the plug-in
characteristic as well as avoids the donsker condtion. The advantage of our
procedure is the implementation of the targeting is identical to that of a
regular TMLE, once all the validation set initial predictions have been formed.
In short, we stack the validation set predictions and pretend as if we have a
regular TMLE, which is not necessarily quite a plug-in estimator on each fold
but overall will perform asymptotically the same and might have some slight
advantage, a subject for future research. In the case of average treatment
effect, treatment specific mean and mean outcome under a stochastic
intervention, the procedure overlaps exactly with the originally formulated

their interpretability is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm for estimating the dimensions contributing to the detected anomalies

more accurately than baseline methods.

help, offering assistance, and coordinating rescue activities in disaster.
Social networks such as Twitter allow users to continuously update relevant
information, which is especially useful during a crisis, where the rapidly
changing conditions make it crucial to be able to access accurate information
promptly. Social media helps those directly affected to inform others of
conditions on the ground in real time and thus enables rescue workers to
coordinate their efforts more effectively, better meeting the survivors' need.
This paper presents a new sequence to sequence based framework for forecasting
people's needs during disasters using social media and weather data. It
consists of two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, one of which encodes
input sequences of weather information and the other plays as a conditional
decoder that decodes the encoded vector and forecasts the survivors' needs.
Case studies utilizing data collected during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Hurricane
Harvey and Hurricane Irma in 2017 were analyzed and the results compared with
those obtained using a statistical language model n-gram and an LSTM generative
model. Our proposed sequence to sequence method forecast people's needs more
successfully than either of the other models. This new approach shows great
promise for enhancing disaster management activities such as evacuation
planning and commodity flow management.

There is growing recognition that SDN and SD-WAN technologies not only expand

of the relationship between the monochromatic star formation rate (SFR)
estimator based on 12 $\mu$m emission and the total SFR estimator based on a
combination of far-ultraviolet and 24 $\mu$m emission. We show the 12 $\mu$m
emission to be a linear estimator of total SFR on spatial scales from 782 pc
down to 49 pc, over almost four magnitudes in SFR. These results therefore
extend to sub-kpc length scales the analogous results from other studies for
global length scales. We use high-resolution HI and $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(J=2-1)$
image sets from the literature to compare the star formation to the neutral
gas. For the full range of length scales we find well-defined power-law
relationships between 12 $\mu$m-derived SFR surface densities and neutral gas
surface densities. For the H$_\mathrm{2}$ gas component almost all correlations
are consistent with being linear. No evidence is found for a breakdown in the
star formation law at small length scales in M 33 reported by other authors. We
show that the average star formation efficiency in M 33 is roughly $10^{-9}$
yr$^{-1}$ and that it remains constant down to giant molecular cloud length
scales. Toomre and shear-based models of the star formation threshold are shown
to inaccurately account for the star formation activity in the inner disc of M
33. Finally, we clearly show that the HI saturation limit of $\approx 9$
M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ reported in the literature for other galaxies is not an
intrinsic property of M 33 - it is systematically introduced as an artefact of

any diffusion approximation, using realistic dust and gas opacities.
  Our results show that the properties of the protostar are essentially
independent of the initial conditions, which had previously only been confirmed
for higher mass ranges. For very low mass initial conditions, however, we find
that the first core phase of the collapse shows some significant differences in
the time evolution, with the first core lifetime increasing dramatically
because of the reduced accretion rate from the surrounding envelope. We
consider the observational implications of this. We also investigate the
opposite case of a collapse without any first core phase, which may occur for
very unstable initial conditions.
  In the appendix, we describe a severe numerical problem that causes an
unphysical expansion after the formation of the protostar, which may affect
other attempts at similar calculations of self-gravitational collapse. We
explain the origin of the unphysical behavior and present a solution that can

compressibility of such an expansion, we can exploit structured sparsity
(typically a group sparsity structure) to recover the sequence of coefficients
with high accuracy.
  While traditional compressed sensing would typically expect a number of
snapshots scaling exponentially with the number of parameters, we can beat this
dependence by adding weights. This anisotropic handling of the parameter space
permits to compute approximations with a number of samples scaling only
linearly (up to log-factors) with the intrinsic complexity of the polynomial
expansion.
  Our results are applied to problems in high-dimensional parametric elliptic
PDEs. We show that under some weighted uniform ellipticity assumptions of a
parametric operator, we are capable of numerically approximating the full
solution (in contrast to the usual quantity of interest) to within a specified
accuracy.

graph theoretic approach, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov type bound by a
factor of $\Omega(\log{n})$, when $d$ is fixed and $n$ goes into infinity. We
also propose a new encoding scheme based on binary constant weight codes.

populations and simple galaxy models. First, we analyze the effect of bursts
and mergers and companion chemical pollution and rejuvenation of the stellar
content on the integrated light emitted by galaxies. The dispersion of the
galaxy magnitudes and colors on the $M_V-(B-V)$ plane is mainly due to mixing
of ages and metallicities of the stellar populations, with mergers weighting
more than bursts of similar mass fractions. The analysis is made using the
Monte-Carlo technique applied to ideal model galaxies reduced to single stellar
populations with galaxy-size mass to evaluate mass, age and metallicity of each
object. We show that separately determining the contributions by bursts and
mergers leads to a better understanding of observed properties of CMD of
cluster galaxies. Then we repeat the analysis using suitable chemo-photometric
models of galaxies whose mass is derived from the cosmological predictions of
the galaxy content of typical clusters. Using the halo mass function and the
Monte-Carlo technique, we derive the formation redshift of each galaxy and its
photometric history. These are used to simulate the CMD of the cluster
galaxies. The main conclusion is that most massive galaxies have acquired the
red color they show today in very early epochs and remained the same ever
since. The simulations nicely reproduce the Red Sequence, the Green Valley and
the Blue Cloud, the three main regions of the CMD in which galaxies crowd.

investigate the thermal transport properties of the oxidized form of

equation based on first-principles density functional theory. We reveal that PO
exhibits a much lower thermal conductivity (2.42-7.08 W/mK, at 300 K) than its
pristine counterpart as well as other two-dimensional materials. To comprehend
the physical origin of such low thermal conductivity, we scrutinize the
contribution of each phonon branch to the thermal conductivity by evaluating
various mode-dependent quantities including Gruneisen parameters, anharmonic
threep-honon scattering rate, phase space of three-phonon scattering processes.
Our results show that its exible puckered structure of PO leads to smaller
sound velocities; its broken-mirror symmetry allows more ZA phonon scattering;
and the relatively-free vibration of dangling oxygen atoms in PO gives rise to
additional scattering resulting in further reduction in the phonon lifetime.
These results can be verified by the fact that PO has larger phase space for
three-phonon processes than phosphorene. Furthermore we show that the thermal
conductivity of PO can be optimized by controlling its size or its phonon mean
free path, indicating that PO can be a promising candidate for low-dimensional
thermoelectric devices.

special property, we propose a low gradient regularization method which reduces
the penalty for horizontal or vertical derivative $\pm1$. The proposed low
gradient regularization is integrated with the guided filter into the depth

our proposed approach both qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

high-performance computing. In the design stage, the systematic two-track

Firstly, the novel parametric method, devised for system-wide full

yielding a substantial enhancement of its photon-detection efficiency.
Secondly, the minimisation of all types of limiting noise sources identified
resulted in a boost to detector's signal-to-noise ratio, thereby achieving its
targeted range of sensitivity. The subsequent synchrotron-radiation experiment
with this X-ray detector demonstrated its capability to respond to 8-keV photon

to the transformation of the incident toroidal electric field phasor into a
poloidal electric field phasor, or \textit{vice versa}, and a consequence of
this source-invariance is the polarization-state invariance of the differential
scattering efficiency when the irradiating field is a plane wave. Both the
total scattering and forward-scattering efficiencies of an ellipsoid composed
of the simplest Lorentz-nonreciprocal medium are maximum when the plane wave is
incident in a direction {coparallel (but not antiparallel)} to $\bf \Gamma$,
and the backscattering efficiency is minimum when $\bf \Gamma$ is {parallel} to
the incidence direction. The total scattering and the forward-scattering
efficiencies are maximum when the incidence direction is parallel to the

step towards a comprehensive physical theory of biological systems. However,
the immense complexity of real cells obscures the fundamental tensions between
energy gradients and entropic contributions that underlie duplication. The
study of synthetic, feasible systems reproducing part of the key ingredients of
living entities but overcoming major sources of biological complexity is of
great relevance to deepen the comprehension of the fundamental thermodynamic
processes underlying life and its prevalence. In this paper an abstract -- yet
realistic -- synthetic system made of small synthetic protocell aggregates is
studied in detail. A fundamental relation between free energy and entropic
gradients is derived for a general, non-equilibrium scenario, setting the
thermodynamic conditions for the occurrence and prevalence of duplication
phenomena. This relation sets explicitly how the energy gradients invested in
creating and maintaining structural -- and eventually, functional -- elements
of the system must always compensate the entropic gradients, whose
contributions come from changes in the translational, configurational and
macrostate entropies, as well as from dissipation due to irreversible
transitions. Work/energy relations are also derived, defining lower bounds on
the energy required for the duplication event to take place. A specific example
including real ternary emulsions is provided in order to grasp the orders of
magnitude involved in the problem. It is found that the minimal work invested
over the system to trigger a duplication event is around $\sim 10^{-13}{\rm
J}$. Without aiming to describe a truly biological process of duplication, this
theoretical contribution seeks to explicitly define and identify the key actors
that participate in it.

transmission in multiple access channels. To overcome its reliance on channel
station information (CSI), this work proposes a novel blind over-the-air

complexity and low latency IoT networks. To solve the resulting non-convex
optimization problem without the initialization dependency exhibited by the
solutions of a number of recently proposed efficient algorithms, we develop a
Wirtinger flow solution to the BlairComp problem based on random
initialization. To analyze the resulting efficiency, we prove its statistical
optimality and global convergence guarantee. Specifically, in the first stage
of the algorithm, the iteration of randomly initialized Wirtinger flow given
sufficient data samples can enter a local region that enjoys strong convexity
and strong smoothness within a few iterations. We also prove the estimation
error of BlairComp in the local region to be sufficiently small. We show that,
at the second stage of the algorithm, its estimation error decays exponentially
at a linear convergence rate.

problems but it frequently comes at a cost that is not acceptable since it
usually involves a complex and expensive computer code. Engineers often
overcome this limitation by first identifying which parameters drive the most
the function variations: non-influential variables are set to a fixed value and
the optimization procedure is carried out with the remaining influential
variables. Such variable selection is performed through influence measures that
are meaningful for regression problems. However it does not account for the
specific structure of optimization problems where we would like to identify
which variables most lead to constraints satisfaction and low values of the
objective function. In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that
accounts for the specific aspects of optimization problems. In particular, we
introduce an influence measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence
Criterion to characterize whether a design variable matters to reach low values
of the objective function and to satisfy the constraints. This sensitivity
measure makes it possible to sort the inputs and reduce the problem dimension.
We compare a random and a greedy strategies to set the values of the
non-influential variables before conducting a local optimization. Applications
to several test-cases show that this variable selection and the greedy strategy
significantly reduce the number of function evaluations at a limited cost in
terms of solution performance.

the Gaisser-Hillas parametrization within the range studied, for E > 10^{17.8}
eV. A detailed analysis of the systematic uncertainties is performed using 10
years of data and a full detector simulation. The average shape is quantified
using two variables related to the width and asymmetry of the profile, and the
results are compared with predictions of hadronic interaction models for
different primary particles.

  non-linear feature relations",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existing biclustering algorithms for finding feature relation based
biclusters often depend on assumptions like monotonicity or linearity. Though a
few algorithms overcome this problem by using density-based methods, they tend
to miss out many biclusters because they use global criteria for identifying
dense regions. The proposed method, RelDenClu uses the local variations in
marginal and joint densities for each pair of features to find the subset of
observations, which forms the bases of the relation between them. It then finds
the set of features connected by a common set of observations, resulting in a
bicluster.
  To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, experimentation has
been carried out on fifteen types of simulated datasets. Further, it has been
applied to six real-life datasets. For three of these real-life datasets, the
proposed method is used for unsupervised learning, while for other three
real-life datasets it is used as an aid to supervised learning. For all the
datasets the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of seven
different state-of-the-art algorithms and the proposed algorithm is seen to
produce better results. The efficacy of proposed algorithm is also seen by its
use on COVID-19 dataset for identifying some features (genetic, demographics
and others) that are likely to affect the spread of COVID-19.

an early predictor of Parkinson's disease. This study proposes a
fully-automated framework for RBD detection consisting of automated sleep
staging followed by RBD identification. Analysis was assessed using a limited
polysomnography montage from 53 participants with RBD and 53 age-matched
healthy controls. Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest
(RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels. For RBD detection, a
RF classifier was trained combining established techniques to quantify muscle
atonia with additional features that incorporate sleep architecture and the EMG
fractal exponent. Automated multi-state sleep staging achieved a 0.62 Cohen's
Kappa score. RBD detection accuracy improved by 10% to 96% (compared to
individual established metrics) when using manually annotated sleep staging.
Accuracy remained high (92%) when using automated sleep staging. This study
outperforms established metrics and demonstrates that incorporating sleep
architecture and sleep stage transitions can benefit RBD detection. This study
also achieved automated sleep staging with a level of accuracy comparable to
manual annotation. This study validates a tractable, fully-automated, and
sensitive pipeline for RBD identification that could be translated to wearable
take-home technology.

is followed by our proposed low-complexity self-interference equalizers. Unlike
other known low complexity GFDM transceivers, our proposed transceiver attains
low complexity for arbitrary number of time and frequency slots. The complexity
of our proposed transceiver is log-linear with a number of transmitted symbols
and achieves 3 to 300 times lower complexity compared to the existing

From data properties to data value",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data today fuels both the economy and advances in machine learning and AI.
All aspects of decision making, at the personal and enterprise level and in
governments are increasingly data-driven. In this context, however, there are
still some fundamental questions that remain unanswered with respect to data.
\textit{What is meant by data value? How can it be quantified, in a general
sense?}. The ""value"" of data is not understood quantitatively until it is used
in an application and output is evaluated, and hence currently it is not
possible to assess the value of large amounts of data that companies hold,
categorically. Further, there is overall consensus that good data is important
for any analysis but there is no independent definition of what constitutes
good data.
  In our paper we try to address these gaps in the valuation of data and
present a framework for users who wish to assess the value of data in a
categorical manner. Our approach is to view the data as composed of various
attributes or characteristics, which we refer to as facets, and which in turn
comprise many sub-facets. We define the notion of values that each sub-facet
may take, and provide a seed scoring mechanism for the different values. The
person assessing the data is required to fill in the values of the various
sub-facets that are relevant for the data set under consideration, through a
questionnaire that attempts to list them exhaustively. Based on the scores
assigned for each set of values, the data set can now be quantified in terms of
its properties. This provides a basis for the comparison of the relative merits
of two or more data sets in a structured manner, independent of context. The
presence of context adds additional information that improves the
quantification of the data value.

$y=0.35$, in the range $0\le z\le 1$. The gradual Y/Eu isovalent substitution
smoothly drives the system through the Mott-insulator to superconductor
transition from a full antiferromagnet with N\'eel transition $T_N=320$ K at
$z=0$ to a bulk superconductor with superconducting critical temperature
$T_c=18$ K at $z=1$, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.35}$. The electronic properties are
finely tuned by gradual lattice deformations induced by the different cationic
radii of the two lanthanides, inducing a continuous change of the basal Cu(1)-O
chain length, as well as a controlled amount of disorder in the active
Cu(2)O$_2$ bilayers. We check that internal charge transfer from the basal to
the active plane is entirely responsible for the doping of the latter and we
show that superconductivity emerges with orthorhombicity. By comparing
transition temperatures with those of the isoelectronic clean system we
deterime the influence of pure structural disorder connected with the Y/Eu
alloy.

dynamics is mixed, with chaotic and regular zones in phase space. Our numerical
simulations show that the chaotic spectra of these systems exhibit strong peaks
in the autocorrelation which are at odd with Random Matrix Theory predictions.
We explain these peaks through a semiclassical theory based on the peculiar
distribution of the actions of classical periodic orbits. Indeed this
distribution is strongly bunched around the average action between two
consecutive rebounds and its multiples. In stars this phenomenon is a direct
consequence of the strong decrease of the sound speed towards the star surface,
but it would arise in any other physical system with a similar bunching of
orbit actions. The peaks discussed could be observed by space missions and give

opened the field to many other computer vision applications based on improving
and changing the characteristics of the input image to follow some given
training requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the
denoising and reconstruction of the micro-Doppler ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$-D)

on 22 subjects walking on a treadmill at an intermediate velocity using a
\unit[25]{GHz} CW radar. In one set, a clean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-D spectrum is
collected for each subject by placing the radar at a close distance to the
subject. In the other set, variations are introduced in the experiment setup to
introduce different noise and clutter effects on the spectrum by changing the
distance and placing reflective objects between the radar and the target.
Synthetic paired noisy and noise-free spectra were used for training, while
validation was carried out on the real noisy measured data. Finally,
qualitative and quantitative comparison with other classical radar denoising
approaches in the literature demonstrated the proposed GANs framework is better
and more robust to different noise levels.

mechanisms takes place in systems with a symmetry group where mirror planes
lead to protected nodal line structures. When these mirror symmetries are
broken, e. g. via fixing a magnetization direction, a gap in the former nodal

materials have three mirror planes in the non-magnetic case, leading to three
nodal lines near the Fermi level. However, dependent on the orientation of the

are gapped, creating large Berry curvature. Because the Fermi level is located
in vicinity of the gapped lines, this leads to a large anomalous Hall and

doping in the system.

fake. This encourages us to learn segmentation by generating realistic
composite images. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework that exploits a
new proposed prior called the independence prior based on Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator produces an image with multiple
category-specific instance providers, a layout module and a composition module.
Firstly, each provider independently outputs a category-specific instance image
with a soft mask. Then the provided instances' poses are corrected by the
layout module. Lastly, the composition module combines these instances into a
final image. Training with adversarial loss and penalty for mask area, each
provider learns a mask that is as small as possible but enough to cover a
complete category-specific instance. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation
methods widely use grouping cues modeling the association between image parts,
which are either artificially designed or learned with costly segmentation
labels or only modeled on local pairs. Unlike them, our method automatically
models the dependence between any parts and learns instance segmentation. We
apply our framework in two cases: (1) Foreground segmentation on
category-specific images with box-level annotation. (2) Unsupervised learning
of instance appearances and masks with only one image of homogeneous object
cluster (HOC). We get appealing results in both tasks, which shows the
independence prior is useful for instance segmentation and it is possible to
unsupervisedly learn instance masks with only one image.

of increasingly sophisticated spectral retrieval techniques and the collective

generation of instruments in space and from the ground is expected to deliver
higher quality data in the next decade, it is therefore paramount to upgrade
current models and improve their reliability, completeness and numerical speed
with which they can be run. In this paper, we address the issue of reliability
of the results provided by retrieval models in the presence of systematics of
unknown origin. More specifically, we demonstrate that if we fit directly
individual light-curves at different wavelengths (L-retrieval), instead of
fitting transit or eclipse depths, as it is currently done (S-retrieval), the
results obtained are more robust against astrophysical and instrumental noise.
This new approach is tested, in particular, when discrepant simulated
observations from HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC are combined. We find that while
S-retrievals converge to an incorrect solution without any warning,
L-retrievals are able to identify potential discrepancies between the

""$EB$~leakage"" refers to the artificial $B$-mode signal coming from the leakage
of $E$-mode signal when part of the sky is unavailable or excluded. Correction
of such leakage is one of the preconditions for detecting primordial
gravitational waves via the CMB $B$-mode signal. In this work, we design two
independent methods for correcting the $EB$~leakage directly in the pixel
domain using standard definitions of the $E$- and $B$-modes. The two methods
give consistent results, and both are fast and easy to implement. Tests on a
CMB simulation containing zero initial $B$-mode show an efficient suppression
of the $EB$ leakage. When combined with the MASTER method to reconstruct the
full-sky $B$-mode spectrum in simulations with a relatively simple mask, the
error from EB-leakage is suppressed further by more than one order of magnitude
at the recombination bump, and up to three orders of magnitude at higher
multipoles, compared to a ""pure"" MASTER scheme under the same conditions.
Meanwhile, although the final power spectrum estimation benefits from
apodization, the pixel domain correction itself is done without apodization,

agrees with the predictions for orthorhombic space group D2h16-Pbnm (Z=4) and
coexists with a paramagnon spin resonance and rare earth crystal field
transitions. Increasing the temperature, a number of vibrational bands undergo
profile broadening and softening approaching the orbital disordered phase where
the orthorhombic O' lower temperature cooperative phase coexists with
cubic-orthorhombic O. O-ErMnO3 undergoes a first order order-disorder
transition into the perovskite cubic phase at Tcubic ~1329 K where the three
triple degenerate phonons allowed by the space group Pm-3m(Z=1) are identified.
At about 800 K, a quantitative small polaron analysis of the orthorhombic
mid-infrared real part optical conductivity shows that antisymmetric and
symmetric breathing modes sustain the strongest electron-phonon interactions.
Above Tcubic the bipolaron fingerprint profile is the mid-infrared dominant and
only feature. Its appearance correlates with the localized screening of the
highest vibrational mode reststrahlen band. We propose that the longitudinal
optical mode macroscopic field screening is consequence of dynamically sharing
{\delta} disproportioned eg electrons hovering over the JT distorted octahedral
dimer [Mn (QJT)3+{\delta} (Mn(QJT)3-{\delta}))O6/2]2. A thermal driven
insulator-metal transition is detected with onset ~1600 K. We also address the
occurrence of an inhomogeneity induced THz band result of heating the samples
in dry air, triggering Mn3+-Mn4+ double exchange, under the presence of Mn4+
smaller ions stabilizing the orthorhombic lattice.

""mirage particles"" accounting for its unique behavior. Within the time-interval

mirage particles, of which some can be negative. What appears to be
""no-particle,"" known to give rise to Interaction-Free Measurement, is in fact a
self-canceling pair of positive and negative mirage particles, which can be
momentarily split and cancel out again. Feasible experiments can give empirical
evidence for these fleeting phenomena. In this respect, the Heisenberg ontology

trap-induced correlation dip of first order correlations in position space, as
well as overestimates the fragmentation, defined as the average relative

understanding of the ultrafast cross-layer charge transfer process in 2D
heterostructures, mechanisms for the interfacial photocarrier recombination
remain, to a large extent, unclear. Here, we investigate a heterostructure
comprised of black phosphorus (BP) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with a
type-II band alignment. Interestingly, it is found that the photo-generated
electrons in MoS2 (transferred from BP) exhibit an ultrafast lifetime of about
5 ps, significantly shorter than those of the constituent materials. By
corroborating with the relaxation of photo-excited holes in BP, it is revealed
that the ultrafast time constant is as a result of efficient Langevin
recombination, where the high hole mobility of BP facilitates a large
recombination coefficient (approximately 2x10^-10 m^2/s). In addition,
broadband transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that the hot electrons
transferred to MoS2 distribute over a broad energy range following an ultrafast
thermalization. The rate of the interlayer Langevin recombination is found to
exhibit no energy level dependence. Our findings provide essential insights
into the fundamental photo-physics in type-II 2D heterostructures, and also
provide useful guidelines for customizing photocarrier lifetimes of BP for

the coupling is explained by magnetic reconnection at a vertical current sheet

that oppositely directed field is brought together underneath, creating the

plasmoids springing from a vertical current sheet merge into a leading plasmoid
occupying the upper tip of the current sheet. Rising at increasing speed to
stretch the overlying loops, this leading plasmoid then expands impulsively

complexity with respect to the number of variables. In this manuscript, aimed
at approximating the PF, we consider Multi-Graph Models where binary variables

an undirected multi-graph. We suggest a new methodology for analysis and
computations that combines the Gauge Function technique with the technique from
the field of real stable polynomials. We show that the Gauge Function has a
natural polynomial representation in terms of gauges/variables associated with
edges of the multi-graph. Moreover, it can be used to recover the Partition
Function through a sequence of transformations allowing appealing algebraic and
graphical interpretations. Algebraically, one step in the sequence consists in
application of a differential operator over gauges associated with an edge.
Graphically, the sequence is interpreted as a repetitive elimination of edges
resulting in a sequence of models on decreasing in size graphs with the same
Partition Function. Even though complexity of computing factors in the sequence
models grow exponentially with the number of eliminated edges, polynomials
associated with the new factors remain bi-stable if the original factors have

galaxy images in the HSC survey and accounting for the residual sky background
sampled with random points. The surface brightness profiles in HSC $r$-band are
measured for a wide range of galaxy stellar masses
($9.2<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<11.4$) and out to 120 kpc. Failing to account for
the stellar halo below the noise level of individual images will lead to
underestimates of the total luminosity by $\leq 15\%$. Splitting galaxies
according to the concentration parameter of their light distributions, we find
that the surface brightness profiles of low concentration galaxies drop faster
between 20 and 100 kpc than those of high concentration galaxies. Albeit the
large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter, we find a strong self-similarity of the stellar
halo profiles. They show unified forms once the projected distance is scaled by
the halo virial radius. The colour of galaxies is redder in the centre and
bluer outside, with high concentration galaxies having redder and more
flattened colour profiles. There are indications of a colour minimum, beyond
which the colour of the outer stellar halo turns red again. This colour
minimum, however, is very sensitive to the completeness in masking satellite
galaxies. We also examine the effect of the extended PSF in the measurement of
the stellar halo, which is particularly important for low mass or low
concentration galaxies. The PSF-corrected surface brightness profile can be
measured down to $\sim$31 $\mathrm{mag}/\mathrm{arcsec}^2$ at 3-$\sigma$
significance. PSF also slightly flattens the measured colour profiles.

interior regions. The interaction between both, e.g., the transfer of heat,
mass, or angular momentum depends on whether and how flows penetrate into the
stable layer. Powered from the unstable, convective regions, radial flows can
pierce into the stable region depending on their inertia (overshooting). In
rapidly rotating systems, the dynamics are strongly influenced by the Coriolis
force and radial flows penetrate in stratified regions due to the geostrophic
invariance of columnar convection even in the limit of vanishing inertia.
Within this study, we numerically investigate both mechanisms and hence explore
the nature of penetrative convection in rapidly rotating spherical shells. The
study covers a broad range of system parameters, such as the strength of the
stratification relative to the Coriolis force or the inertia. Guided by the
application to Saturn, we model a sandwiched stable stratified layer (SSL)
surrounded by two convective zones. A comprehensive analysis of the damping
behavior of convective flows at the edges of the SSL showed that the mean
penetration depth is controlled by the ratio of stratified and unstratified
buoyancy gradients and is hence independent of rotation. A scaling law is
derived and suggests that the penetration depth decreases with the square root
of the ratio of unstabilizing and stabilizing entropy gradients. The influence
of the Coriolis force, however, is evident by a modulation of the penetration
depth along latitude, since convective columns are elongated vertically and
hence pierce predominantly into the SSL around mid-latitudes and outside the
tangent cylinder. Our result also show that the penetration depth decreases
linearly with the flow length scale (low pass filter), confirming predictions
from the linear theory of rotating partially stratified convection.

observatory based on multiple 12-U CubeSats in geosynchronous orbit. The
objective is a fast track mission which would fill the observational gap
between LISA and ground based observatories. With albeit a lower sensitivity,
it would allow early investigation of the nature and event rate of
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers, constraining our understanding of
the universe formation by probing the building up of IMBH up to supermassive
black holes. Technically, the CubeSats would create a triangular Sagnac
interferometer with 140.000km roundtrip arm length, optimized to be sensitive
to gravitational waves at frequencies between 10mHz and 2Hz. The nature of the
Sagnac measurement makes it almost insensitive to position error, enabling the
use of spacecrafts in ballistic trajectories. The light source and
recombination units of the interferometer are based on compact fibered
technologies without bulk optics. A peak sensitivity of 23 pm/sqrt(Hz) is
expected at 1Hz assuming a 200mW internal laser source and 10-centimeter
diameter apertures. Because of the absence of a test mass, the main limitation
would come from the non-gravitational forces applied on the spacecrafts.
However, conditionally upon our ability to partially post-process the effect of
solar wind and solar pressure, SAGE would allow detection of gravitational
waves with strains as low as a few 1e-19 within the 0.1 to 1Hz range. Averaged
over the entire sky, and including the antenna gain of the Sagnac

applications in a wide range of areas such as planning and scheduling, resource
allocation, and pattern matching. So far coloring problems are mostly studied
on static graphs, which often stand in stark contrast to practice where data is
inherently dynamic and subject to discrete changes over time. A temporal graph
is a graph whose edges are assigned a set of integer time labels, indicating at
which discrete time steps the edge is active. In this paper we present a
natural temporal extension of the classical graph coloring problem. Given a
temporal graph and a natural number $\Delta$, we ask for a coloring sequence
for each vertex such that (i) in every sliding time window of $\Delta$
consecutive time steps, in which an edge is active, this edge is properly
colored (i.e. its endpoints are assigned two different colors) at least once
during that time window, and (ii) the total number of different colors is
minimized. This sliding window temporal coloring problem abstractly captures
many realistic graph coloring scenarios in which the underlying network changes
over time, such as dynamically assigning communication channels to moving
agents. We present a thorough investigation of the computational complexity of
this temporal coloring problem. More specifically, we prove strong
computational hardness results, complemented by efficient exact and
approximation algorithms. Some of our algorithms are linear-time
fixed-parameter tractable with respect to appropriate parameters, while others
are asymptotically almost optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).

According to simulations, and based on total external reflection, this KB
offers a broad-band multi-keV reflection spectra, allowing more spectral
tunablity than conventional Bragg crystals. In addition to be vacuum
compatible, the prototype is characterised by a relatively small size (21cm x
31cm x 27cm) and permits remote control and modification of both the radius of
curvature (down to 10m) and the grazing incidence angle (up to 60mrad). A few

number of nodes with finite capacity are investigated. Every node is receiving
a flow of requests and when a request arrives at a saturated node, i.e. a node
whose capacity is fully utilized, an allocation algorithm may attempt to
re-allocate the request to a non-saturated node. For the algorithms considered,
the re-allocation comes at a price: either an extra-capacity is required in the
system or the processing time of a re-allocated request is increased. The paper
analyzes the properties of the equilibrium points of the asymptotic associated
dynamical system when the number of nodes gets large. At this occasion the
classical model of {\em Gibbens, Hunt and Kelly} (1990) in this domain is
revisited. The absence of known Lyapunov functions for the corresponding
dynamical system complicates significantly the analysis. Several techniques are
used: Analytic and scaling methods to identify the equilibrium points. We
identify the subset of parameters for which the limiting stochastic model of
these networks has multiple equilibrium points. Probabilistic approaches, like
coupling, are used to prove the stability of some of them. A criterion of
exponential stability with the spectral gap of the associated linear operator
of equilibrium points is also obtained.

metric constraint, where the goal is to minimize \textit{Distortion}, the worst
case social cost of an ordinal mechanism relative to underlying cardinal
utilities. We consider two additional desiderata: Constant sample complexity
and Squared Distortion. Constant sample complexity means that the mechanism
(potentially randomized) only uses a constant number of ordinal queries
regardless of the number of voters and alternatives. Squared Distortion is a
measure of variance of the Distortion of a randomized mechanism.
  Our primary contribution is the first social choice mechanism with constant
sample complexity \textit{and} constant Squared Distortion (which also implies
constant Distortion). We call the mechanism Random Referee, because it uses a
random agent to compare two alternatives that are the favorites of two other
random agents. We prove that the use of a comparison query is necessary: no
mechanism that only elicits the top-k preferred alternatives of voters (for
constant k) can have Squared Distortion that is sublinear in the number of
alternatives. We also prove that unlike any top-k only mechanism, the
Distortion of Random Referee meaningfully improves on benign metric spaces,
using the Euclidean plane as a canonical example. Finally, among top-1 only
mechanisms, we introduce Random Oligarchy. The mechanism asks just 3 queries
and is essentially optimal among the class of such mechanisms with respect to
Distortion.
  In summary, we demonstrate the surprising power of constant sample complexity
mechanisms generally, and just three random voters in particular, to provide
some of the best known results in the implicit utilitarian framework.

vulnerabilities stemming from weak architectural design, record overflow, and
failure to sanitize inputs properly. For example, they implemented a

Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft have demonstrated
that multiple spiral wave structures in Saturn's rings are probably generated

able to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation
rate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal
modes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes
do not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.
Fortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to
be uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical
tools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave
actually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at
1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.
Furthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave

sequence of fundamental sectoral normal modes with azimuthal wavenumbers from 2

primordial epochs of the Milky Way formation. In this work, literature data of
globular clusters ages, chemical abundances, and structural parameters are
studied, explicitly focussing on the origin of the known split in the
age-metallicity relation of globular clusters. When the alpha-element
abundances, which are less strongly affected by the internal light-element
spread of globular clusters (Si, Ca), are considered, a very low observational
scatter among metal-poor clusters is observed. A plateau at [SiCa/Fe]~0.35 dex,
with a dispersion of only 0.05 dex is observed up to a metallicity of about
-0.75 dex. Only a few metal-poor clusters in this metallicity interval present
low [SiCa/Fe] abundances. Moreover, metal-rich globular clusters show a knee in
the [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plane around [Fe/H] -0.75 dex. As a consequence,
if a substantial fraction of galactic globular clusters has an external origin,
they have to be mainly formed either in galaxies that are massive enough to
ensure high levels of [alpha/Fe] element abundances even at intermediate
metallicity, or in lower mass dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way in their
early phases of formation. Finally, clusters in the metal-poor branch of the
AMR present an anti-correlation of [SiCa/Fe] with the total cluster magnitude,
while this is not the case for metal-rich branch clusters. In addition, this
lack of faint high-alpha clusters in the young metal-poor population is in
contrast with what is observed for old and more metal-poor clusters, possibly
reflecting a higher heterogeneity of formation environments at lower
metallicity. Accretion of high-mass satellites, as a major contribution to the
current Milky Way globular cluster system both in the metal-poor and the
metal-intermediate regime is compatible with the observations.

important question is under which conditions a sub-program can be replaced by
another one without changing the meaning, in any context. This problem is known
as strong equivalence, and is well-studied for ASP. For ELPs, this question has
been approached by embedding them into epistemic extensions of equilibrium
logics. In this paper, we consider a simpler, more direct characterization that
is directly applicable to the language used in state-of-the-art ELP solvers.
This also allows us to give tight complexity bounds, showing that strong
equivalence for ELPs remains coNP-complete, as for ASP. We further use our
results to provide syntactic characterizations for tautological rules and rule
subsumption for ELPs.

star-disk interaction and the accretion process onto the central star of LkCa
15, a transition disk system with an inner dust cavity. We obtained
quasi-simultaneous photometric and spectropolarimetric observations of the
system over several rotational periods. We analyzed the system light curve, as
well as changes in spectral continuum and line profile to derive the properties
of the accretion flow from the edge of the inner disk to the central star. We
also derived magnetic field measurements at the stellar surface. We find that
the system exhibits magnetic, photometric, and spectroscopic variability with a
period of about 5.70 days. The light curve reveals a periodic dip, which
suggests the presence of an inner disk warp that is located at the corotation
radius at about 0.06 au from the star. Line profile variations and veiling
variability are consistent with a magnetospheric accretion model where the
funnel flows reach the star at high latitudes. This leads to the development of
an accretion shock close to the magnetic poles. All diagnostics point to a
highly inclined inner disk that interacts with the stellar magnetosphere. The
spectroscopic and photometric variability of LkCa 15 is remarkably similar to
that of AA Tau, the prototype of periodic dippers. We therefore suggest that
the origin of the variability is a rotating disk warp that is located at the
inner edge of a highly inclined disk close to the star. This contrasts with the
moderate inclination of the outer transition disk seen on the large scale and
thus provides evidence for a significant misalignment between the inner and
outer disks of this planet-forming transition disk system.

domain wall fermions, which furnish the correct U(2N) global symmetry in the
limit that the wall separation $L_s\to\infty$. Attention is focussed on the
issue of spontaneous symmetry breakdown via a non-vanishing fermion bilinear
condensate $\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle\not=0$. Results from quenched

$N=1$ using an RHMC algorithm demonstrate that U(2) symmetry is unbroken at

the overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings,

model could alleviate the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability

but with less accuracy and eventually at bath temperatures below 40 mK. The
voltage-biased setups also require smaller volumes of the normal metal island

implementation challenges of both the variational approach to fracture by
Francfort and Marigo (1998) and its regularized counterpart by Bourdin,
Francfort and Marigo (2000, 2007 and 2008), which is commonly referred to as a
phase-field model of brittle fracture. Irreversibility of the crack phase-field
imposed to prevent fracture healing leads to a constrained minimization
problem, whose optimality condition is given by a variational {\em inequality}.
In our study, the irreversibility is handled via penalization. Provided the
penalty constant is well-tuned, the penalized formulation is a good
approximation to the original one, with the advantage that the induced {\em
equality}-based weak problem enables a much simpler algorithmic treatment. We
propose an analytical procedure for deriving the {\em optimal} penalty
constant, more precisely, its {\em lower bound}, which guarantees a
sufficiently accurate enforcement of the crack phase-field irreversibility. Our
main tool is the notion of the optimal phase-field profile, as well as the
$\Gamma$-convergence result. It is shown that the explicit lower bound is a
function of two formulation parameters (the fracture toughness and the
regularization length scale) but is independent on the problem setup (geometry,
boundary conditions etc.) and the formulation ingredients (degradation
function, tension-compression split etc.). The optimally-penalized formulation
is tested for two benchmark problems, including one with available analytical
solution. We also compare our results with those obtained by using the
alternative irreversibility technique based on the notion of the history field
by Miehe et al.\ (2010).

boundary value problems. For exploiting symmetries of these boundary value
problems in a way that is offered by techniques of dimensional reduction, it
needs to be justified that the derivative in symmetry direction is constant or
even vanishing. A generalized notion of symmetry can be defined with different
directions at every point in space, as long as it is possible to exhibit
unidirectional symmetry in some coordinate representation. This can be
achieved, e.g., when the symmetry direction is given by the direct construction
out of a unidirectional symmetry via a coordinate transformation which poses a
demand on the boundary value problem. Coordinate independent formulations of
boundary value problems do exist but turning that theory into practice demands
a pedantic process of backtranslation to the computational notions. This
becomes even more challenging when multiple chained transformations are
necessary for propagating a symmetry. We try to fill this gap and present the
more general, isolated problems of that translation.
  Within this contribution, the partial derivative and the corresponding chain

encodability in computational terms. We target the layer above univariate

to each user. Furthermore, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is examined
to support higher data rates for each user while using on-off-keying (OOK)
modulation. In addition, the impact of the user's mobility on the multi-user
VLC system performance is studied. The effect of diffuse reflections, mobility
and lighting constraints are taken into account. In addition, the effect of
co-channel interference (CCI) is considered in the multiuser VLC system.

communication (VLC) can be limited by multipath propagation. Here, we use
computer generated holograms (CGHs) in VLC system design to improve the
achievable system data rate. The CGHs are utilized to produce a fixed broad
beam from the light source, selecting the light source that offers the best
performance. The CGHs direct this beam to a specific zone on the room's
communication floor where the receiver is located. This reduces the effect of
diffuse reflections. Consequently, decreasing the intersymbol interference
(ISI) and enabling the VLC indoor channel to support higher data rates. We
consider two settings to examine our propose VLC system and consider lighting
constraints. We evaluate the performance in idealistic and realistic room
setting in a diffuse environment with up to second order reflections and also
under mobility. The results show that using the CGHs enhances the 3dB bandwidth
of the VLC channel and improves the received optical power.
