  Citizen Scientists to make Qualitative Judgments",,,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Citizen science often requires volunteers to perform low-skill tasks such as
counting and documenting en- vironmental features. In this work, we contend
that these tasks do not adequately meet the needs of citizen scientists
motivated by scientific learning. We propose to provide intrinsic motivation by
asking them to no- tice, compare, and synthesize qualitative observations. We
describe the process of learning and performing qualitative assessments in the
domain of water quality monitoring, which appraises the impact of land use on
habitat quality and biological diversity. We use the example of water
monitoring because qualitative wa- tershed assessments are exclusively
performed by professionals, yet do not require specialized tools, making it an
excellent fit for volunteers. Within this domain, we observe and report on
differences in background and training between professional and volunteer
monitors, using these experiences to synthesize findings about volunteer
training needs. Our findings reveal that to successfully make qualitative
stream assessments, vol- unteers need to: (1) experience a diverse range of
streams, (2) discuss judgments with other monitors, and (3) construct internal
narratives about water quality. We use our findings to describe how different
technologies may support these needs and generalize our findings to the larger
citizen science community.

wave pulse interacts with free masses. We calculate the memory effect in
massive gravity as a function of the graviton mass $(m_g)$ and show that it is
discretely different from the result of general relativity: the memory is
reduced not just via the usual expected Yukawa decay but by a numerical factor
which survives even in the massless limit. For the strongest existing bounds on
the graviton mass, the memory is essentially wiped out for the sources located
at distances above 10 Mpc. On the other hand, for the weaker bounds found in
the LIGO observations, the memory is reduced to zero for distances above 0.1
Pc. Hence, we suggest that careful observations of the gravitational wave
memory effect can rule out the graviton mass or significantly bound it. We also
show that adding higher curvature terms reduces the memory effect.

preimages of the map. Reeb spaces are fundamental and useful tools in the
theory of Morse functions and higher dimensional variants and their
applications to geometry. These spaces are polyhedra compatible with natural
simplicial structures of the manifolds in considerable cases. For example, for
Morse functions, fold maps, and proper stable maps, which are useful and
fundamental tools in these studies, they are polyhedra whose dimensions are
equal to those of the manifolds of the targets.
  In the 2010s, Hiratuka and Saeki found that the top-dimensional homology
group of the Reeb space does not vanish for smooth maps such as proper stable
maps having some preimages containing a component which is not (oriented)
null-cobordant and which has no singular points. Recently the author found some
extended versions of this fact formulating and using cobordism-like groups of
equivalence classes of smooth and closed manifolds.
  The present paper concerns cases where manifolds and preimages with no
singular points of maps may have additional algebraic topological or
differential topological structures other than differentiable structures and
orientations. We show a theorem for this case. We also give some explicit
applications of the result where the preimages have spin or spin^c structures

for example. As important applications, we present new explicit construction of
spin cobordisms and spin^c cobordisms for example.

lower bounded facility location (LBFL) problem with general lower bounds. Prior
to our work, such algorithms were only known for the special case where all
facilities have the same lower bound: Svitkina \cite{Svi10} gave a
$448$-approximation for the special case, and subsequently Ahmadian and Swamy
\cite{AS13} improved the approximation factor to 82.6.
  As in \cite{Svi10} and \cite{AS13}, our algorithm for LBFL with general lower
bounds works by reducing the problem to the capacitated facility location (CFL)
problem. To handle some challenges caused by the general lower bounds, our
algorithm involves more reduction steps. One main complication is that after
aggregation of clients and facilities at a few locations, each of these
locations may contain many facilities with different opening costs and lower
bounds. To handle this issue, we introduce and reduce our LBFL problem to an
intermediate problem called the transportation with configurable supplies and
demands (TCSD) problem, which in turn can be reduced to the CFL problem.

nature of the interaction potential is modeled through the constant force
approximation and the self-diffusion coefficients is determined for several
packing fractions at super critical thermodynamic states. The dependence of the
self-diffusion coefficient with the potential range $\lambda$ is analyzed in
the range of $1.1 \leq \lambda \leq 1.5 $. The obtained molecular dynamics
simulations results are in agreement with the self-diffusion coefficient
predicted with the Enskog method. Additionally, we soh that the diffusion
coefficient is very sensitive to the potential range, $\lambda$, at low
densities leading to a density dependence of this coefficient not shared with
other macroscopic properties such as the equation of state. The constant force
approximation used in this work to model the discrete pair potential has shown
to be an excellent scheme to compute the transport properties using standar
computer simulations. Finally, the simulation results presented here are
resourceful to improving theoretical approaches, such as the Enskog method.

using observed galaxy positions and luminosities under the assumption that the

Our method relies on following the gradients of forward model and since the
standard way to identify halos is non-differentiable and results in a discrete
sample of objects, we propose a framework to model the halo position and mass
field starting from the non-linear matter field using Neural Networks. We
evaluate the performance of our model with multiple metrics. Our model is more
than $95\%$ correlated with the halo-mass fields up to $k\sim 0.7 {\rm h/Mpc}$
and significantly reduces the stochasticity over the Poisson shot noise. We
develop a data likelihood model that takes our modeling error and intrinsic
scatter in the halo mass-light relation into account and show that a displaced
log-normal model is a good approximation to it. We optimize over the
corresponding loss function to reconstruct the initial density field and
develop an annealing procedure to speed up and improve the convergence. We
apply the method to halo number densities of $\bar{n} = 2.5\times 10^{-4}
-10^{-3}({\rm h/Mpc})^3$, typical of current and future redshift surveys, and
recover a Gaussian initial density field, mapping all the higher order
information in the data into the power spectrum. We show that our
reconstruction improves over the standard reconstruction. For baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO) the gains are relatively modest because BAO is dominated by
large scales where standard reconstruction suffices. We improve upon it by
$\sim 15-20\%$ in terms of error on BAO peak as estimated by Fisher analysis at
$z=0$. We expect larger gains will be achieved when applying this method to the
broadband linear power spectrum reconstruction on smaller scales.

relate the realization theory for overdetermined autonomous multidimensional

that basic notions of linear algebra suffice to analyze and solve the problem.
The difference equations are associated with a Macaulay matrix formulation, and
it is shown that the null space of the Macaulay matrix is a multidimensional

towards an evolved disk that may show signs of ongoing or completed planet
formation. We observed CS Cha with the high contrast imager VLT/SPHERE in
polarimetric differential imaging mode to resolve the circumbinary disk in near
infrared scattered light. These observations were followed-up by VLT/NACO
L-band observations and complemented by archival VLT/NACO K-band and HST/WFPC2
I-band data. We resolve the compact circumbinary disk around CS Cha for the
first time in scattered light. We find a smooth, low inclination disk with an
outer radius of $\sim$55 au (at 165 pc). We do not detect the inner cavity but
find an upper limit for the cavity size of $\sim$15 au. Furthermore, we find a
faint co-moving companion with a projected separation of 210 au from the
central binary outside of the circumbinary disk. The companion is detected in
polarized light and shows an extreme degree of polarization (13.7$\pm$0.4 \% in
J-band). The companion's J- and H-band magnitudes are compatible with masses of
a few M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. However, K-, L- and I-band data draw this conclusion
into question. We explore with radiative transfer modeling whether an
unresolved circum-companion disk can be responsible for the high polarization
and complex photometry. We find that the set of observations is best explained
by a heavily extincted low mass ($\sim 20 \mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$) brown dwarf

knowledge-augmented detection using expert annotations as PI, (ii) fast

However, whether other factors alter this phenomenology is still under debate,
especially for the case of information spreading through many channels and
platforms. In the present study, we adopt a two-layered network to represent
the interactions of multiple channels and propose a SAR

our model shows a novel double transition including a continuous transition and
a following discontinuous transition in the phase diagram, which originates
from two outbreaks between the two layers of the network. Further, we reveal
that the key factors are a weak coupling condition between the two layers, a
large adoption threshold and the difference of the degree distributions between
the two layers. Then, an edge-based compartmental theory is developed which
fully explains all numerical results. Our findings may be of significance for
understanding the secondary outbreaks of the information in real life.

gravitational waves echoes if the post-merger object features a photon-sphere
capable of partially trapping the gravitational waves. If the post-merger
source is a black hole, a second internal reflection surface, associated to
quantum effects near the black hole horizon, must be present to avoid the
gravitational wave capture. Alternatively, gravitational wave echoes can be
produced by ultracompact stars crossing the photon-sphere line in the
mass-radius diagram during the neutron star merging. In this case, the second
reflection surface is not needed. A recently proposed preliminary analysis
using an incompressible (and so unphysical) equation of state suggests that
gravitational wave echoes at a frequency of tens of Hz can be produced by an
ultracompact star. Since strange stars are extremely compact, we examine the
possibility that strange stars emit gravitational wave echoes at such a
frequency. Using parameterized models of the equation of state of ultra-stiff

but the corresponding frequencies are of the order of tens of kHz, thus not

an overall putative community structure representative of the group as well as

features from both images and numeric data and use these extracted features as
inputs for other machine learning models, namely support vector machines (SVMs)

process was repeated on 3 different image datasets and 2 different numeric

also surpass the performance of the neural network alone. This in turn suggests
that it may be a reasonable practice to use neural networks as a means to

which the use of velocity rescaling thermostats sometimes causes the violation
of the equipartition theorem, affecting both structural and dynamic properties.
The reason for this artifact and the conditions under which it occurs have not
been fully understood. Since the flying ice cube effect was first demonstrated,
a new velocity rescaling algorithm (the CSVR thermostat) has been developed and
become popular without its effects on the equipartition theorem being truly
known. Meanwhile, use of the simple velocity rescaling and Berendsen thermostat
algorithms has not abated but has actually continued to grow. Here, we have
calculated the partitioning of the kinetic energy between translational,
rotational, and vibrational modes in simulations of diatomic molecules to
explicitly determine whether the equipartition theorem is violated under
different thermostats and while rescaling velocities to different kinetic
energy distributions. We have found that the underlying cause of the flying ice
cube effect is a violation of balance leading to systematic redistributions of
kinetic energy under simple velocity rescaling and the Berendsen thermostat.
When velocities are instead rescaled to the canonical ensemble's kinetic energy
distribution, as is done with the CSVR thermostat, the equipartition theorem is
not violated, and we show that the CSVR thermostat satisfies detailed balance.
The critical necessity for molecular dynamics practitioners to abandon the use
of popular yet incorrect velocity rescaling algorithms is underscored with an
example demonstrating that the main result of a highly-cited study is entirely
due to artifacts resulting from the study's use of the Berendsen thermostat.

different centralities (0-5$\%$, 5-10$\%$, 10-20$\%$, 20-40$\%$, 40-60$\%$ and
60-80$\%$), we investigate the scaling property of the pion, kaon and proton
transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) spectra at these centralities. We show that
in the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ region with $p_{\rm T} \leq$ 2.75 (3.10 and 2.35) GeV/c
the pion (kaon and proton) spectra exhibit a scaling behaviour independent of
the centrality of the collisions. This scaling behaviour arises when these
spectra are presented in terms of a suitable variable, $z=p_{\rm{T}}/K$. The
scaling parameter $K$ is determined by the quality factor method and is
parameterized by $a \langle N_{\rm{part}}\rangle^{b}$, where $\langle
N_{\rm{part}}\rangle$ is the average value of the number of participating
nucleons, $a$ and $b$ are free parameters, $b$ characterizes the rate at which
$\textrm{ln} K$ changes with $\textrm{ln} \langle N_{\rm{part}}\rangle$. The
values of $b$ for pions and kaons are consistent within uncertainties, while
they are smaller than that for protons. In the high $p_{\rm{T}}$ region, due to
the suppression of the spectra, a violation of the proposed scaling is observed
going from central to peripheral collisions. The more peripheral the collisions
are, the more clearly violated the proposed scaling becomes. In the framework
of the colour string percolation model, we argue that the pions, kaons and
protons originate from the fragmentation of clusters which are formed by
strings overlapping and the cluster's fragmentation functions are different for

anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), have garnered much attention as a promising path
towards low cost and versatile thermoelectric technology with easily scalable
manufacturing. However, progress in development of STE devices is hindered by
the lack of understanding of the mechanism and materials parameters that govern
the STEs. To address this problem, we enlist machine learning modeling to
establish the key physical parameters controlling SSE. Guided by these models,
we have carried out a high-throughput experiment which led to the
identification of a novel STE material with a thermopower an order of magnitude
larger than that of the current generation STE devices.

efficiency of hospital management and the quality of patient care. This occurs
when the request for an admit ward-bed to receive a patient is delayed until an
admission decision is made by a doctor. To reduce the overcrowding and waiting
time of ED, we build a classifier to predict the disposition of patients using
manually-typed nurse notes collected during triage, thereby allowing hospital
staff to begin necessary preparation beforehand. However, these triage notes
involve high dimensional, noisy, and also sparse text data which makes model
fitting and interpretation difficult. To address this issue, we propose the
semi-orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (SONMF) for both continuous

reduced number of topics. The subjects can then be interpreted as a
non-subtractive linear combination of orthogonal basis topic vectors. These
generated topic vectors provide the hospital with a direct understanding of the
cause of admission. We show that by using a transformation of basis, the
classification accuracy can be further increased compared to the conventional
bag-of-words model and alternative matrix factorization approaches. Through
simulated data experiments, we also demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms other non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods in terms of

provide centimeter-level accuracy, lending itself to many location-aware
applications, e.g., connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One assumption
usually made in the investigation of localization methods is that the user
equipment (UE), i.e., a CAV, and the base station (BS) are {time} synchronized.
In this paper, we remove this assumption and investigate two two-way
localization protocols: (i) a round-trip localization protocol (RLP), whereby
the BS and UE exchange signals in two rounds of transmission and then
localization is achieved using the signal received in the second round; (ii) a
collaborative localization protocol (CLP), whereby localization is achieved
using the signals received in the two rounds. We derive the position and
orientation error bounds applying beamforming at both ends and compare them to
the traditional one-way localization. Our results show that mmWave localization
is mainly limited by the angular rather than the temporal estimation and that

prediction by previous work [Li $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. Lett.

determine the quantum depletion and superfluid density over a large range of
Rabi frequency in different phases. The depletion exhibits an intriguing
behavior with a discontinuous jump at the transition between the stripe and
plane-wave phases, and a maximum at the transition between the plane-wave and
zero-momentum phases. The superfluid density is derived through a phase-twist
method. In the plane-wave and zero-momentum phases, it is significantly
suppressed along the spin-orbit-coupling direction and vanishes at the
transition, consistent with a recent work [Zhang $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev.

challenges simultaneously. In particular, we propose a principled approach to
jointly generate a set of complementary items and the corresponding strategy to
display them in a 2-D page; and propose a novel page-wise recommendation
framework based on deep reinforcement learning, DeepPage, which can optimize a
page of items with proper display based on real-time feedback from users. The
experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

in cases in which the noise variance depends on the state. Furthermore, when
Poisson distributions with relatively small counts are approximated with normal
distributions, multiplicative noise approximations are straightforward to
implement. There are a number of limitations in existing approaches to
marginalize over multiplicative errors, such as positivity of the
multiplicative noise term. The focus in this paper is in large dimensional
(inverse) problems for which sampling type approaches have too high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to
carry out approximative marginalization over the multiplicative error by
embedding the statistics in an additive error term. The approach is essentially
a Bayesian one in that the statistics of the additive error is induced by the
statistics of the other unknowns. As an example, we consider a deconvolution
problem on random fields with different statistics of the multiplicative noise.
Furthermore, the approach allows for correlated multiplicative noise. We show
that the proposed approach provides feasible error estimates in the sense that
the posterior models support the actual image.

any vertex $v\in V\setminus D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$. Fomin et
al.[9] gave an algorithm for enumerating all minimal dominating sets with $n$
vertices in $O(1.7159^n)$ time. It is known that the number of minimal
dominating sets for interval graphs and trees on $n$ vertices is at most
$3^{n/3} \approx 1.4422^n$. In this paper, we introduce the domination cover
number as a new criterion for evaluating the dominating sets in graphs. The
domination cover number of a dominating set $D$, denoted by $\mathcal{C}_D(G)$,
is the summation of the degrees of the vertices in $D$. Maximizing or
minimizing this parameter among all minimal dominating sets have interesting
applications in many real-world problems, such as the art gallery problem.
Moreover, we investigate this concept for different graph classes and propose
some algorithms for finding the domination cover number in trees, block graphs.

higher correlation (0.56) with the flare strength and CME speed. Moreover, the
eruptive flares have threshold of SGPIL length (31Mm), R value

  Exploring this class and its properties, we also show:
  $\bullet$ Under the NC-SETH assumption (a significantly more relaxed

spectral shape in the LAT energy band over the entire dataset, we found that
its spectral behavior changed around 2011 February (~ MJD 55600). The gamma-ray
spectra at the early times evolve largely at high energies, while the photon
indices were unchanged in the latter times despite rather large flux
variations. To explain these observations, we suggest that the flux changes in
the early times were caused by injection of high-energy electrons into the jet,
while later, the gamma-ray flares were caused by a changing Doppler factor
owing to variations in the jet Lorentz factor and/or changes in the angle to
our line of sight. To demonstrate the viability of these scenarios, we fit the
broad-band spectral energy distribution data with a one-zone synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model for flaring and quiescent intervals before and after
2011 February. To explain the gamma-ray spectral behavior in the context of the
SSC model, the maximum electron Lorentz factor would have changed in the early

emanates, which is the same kind as that overlooked in the Neumann-to-Dirichlet

diverging flux in instantaneous limits of DCE but also that the type of
divergence sensitively depends on the combination of initial and final BCs.

that centrality measures are generally positively correlated to each other, the

dynamics by assuming small deflections and applying multiple-scale analysis to
obtain a stability condition. The condition is attained via the compatibility

results yield the maximal stable speed as a function of elastic damping, fluid

weakened if $\delta < 1$. Moreover, for an initial filling fraction $\delta

Tonks-Girardeau gas limit where its density is sufficiently low that effective
repulsions between atoms become infinite. In such case, spin exchange energy of
1D SU($\kappa$) fermions vanishes and all spin configurations are degenerate,
which automatically puts them into spin-incoherent regime. In this limit, we
are able to express the single-particle density matrices in terms of those of
anyons. This allows us to numerically simulate the number of particles up to
$N=32$. We numerically calculate single-particle density matrices in two cases:
(1) equal populations for each spin components (balanced) and (2) all $S_z$
manifolds included. In contrast to noninteracting multi-component fermions, the
momentum distributions are broadened due to strong interactions. As $\kappa$
increases, the momentum distributions are less broadened for fixed $N$, while
they are more broadened for fixed number of particle per spin component. We
then compare numerically calculated high momentum tails with analytical
predictions which are proportional to $1/p^4$, in good agreement. Thus, our
theoretical study provides a comparison with the experiments of repulsive
multicomponent alkaline-earth fermions with a tunable SU($\kappa$)
spin-symmetry in the spin-incoherent regime.

Two models were applied: 1) multi-phase multi-component model based on the

interdiffusion in matrix (global scale in R1) and the diffusion between matrix
and precipitates (local scale in R3). The models were used in numerical
experiments in which the diffusion paths, the local entropy production rate and
the volume fractions of the phases present in the system were calculated. For

compared with experimental findings. It has been shown that both models are
consistent. The multi-phase, multi-component model was applied to simulate
diffusion and the results were compared with experiment. Experimental and
numerical results are in agreement. It has been found that: 1) the type 0
interphase boundary (IB) moves during diffusion, contrary to the Morral
theorem, 2) in the case when the terminal compositions of the two-phase alloys
are close to the phase boundary then the single beta-phase zone can grow
between two-phase zones and diffusion path enters the single-phase region, 3)
the diffusion path strongly depends on the shape of the phase boundary line and
the accuracy of thermodynamical data is a key factor in modelling and 4) the

providing other facts that are pertinent to that main fact can enrich the user
experience and support exploratory information needs. KG fact contextualization
is the task of augmenting a given KG fact with additional and useful KG facts.
The task is challenging because of the large size of KGs, discovering other
relevant facts even in a small neighborhood of the given fact results in an
enormous amount of candidates. We introduce a neural fact contextualization
method (NFCM) to address the KG fact contextualization task. NFCM first
generates a set of candidate facts in the neighborhood of a given fact and then
ranks the candidate facts using a supervised learning to rank model. The
ranking model combines features that we automatically learn from data and that
represent the query-candidate facts with a set of hand-crafted features we
devised or adjusted for this task. In order to obtain the annotations required
to train the learning to rank model at scale, we generate training data
automatically using distant supervision on a large entity-tagged text corpus.
We show that ranking functions learned on this data are effective at
contextualizing KG facts. Evaluation using human assessors shows that it
significantly outperforms several competitive baselines.

However, the existing methods are incapable of handling billion-scale networks,

propose RandNE (Iterative Random Projection Network Embedding), a novel and

reduce the time complexity, we design an iterative projection procedure to
avoid the explicit calculation of the high-order proximities. Theoretical
analysis shows that our method is extremely efficient, and friendly to
distributed computing schemes without any communication cost in the
calculation. We also design a dynamic updating procedure which can efficiently
incorporate the dynamic changes of the networks without error aggregation.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of
RandNE over state-of-the-art methods in several tasks including network
reconstruction, link prediction and node classification on multiple datasets

stabilization time which is polynomial in moves and asymptotically optimal in
rounds. To illustrate the versatility of our method, we review several existing

observable signatures derive from the velocity distribution of DM in halos, in
particular in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Examples include direct searches for
weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), $p$-wave suppressed or
Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation signals, microlensing events of primordial
black holes (PBHs), {\em etc}. Most current predictions are based on the
Maxwellian approximation which is not only theoretically inconsistent in
bounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological simulations. A more
consistent method sometimes used in calculations for direct WIMP searches
relies on the so-called Eddington inversion method, which relates the DM
phase-space distribution function (DF) to its mass density profile and the
total gravitational potential of the system. Originally built upon the isotropy
assumption, this method can be extended to anisotropic systems. We investigate
these inversion methods in the context of Galactic DM searches, motivated by
the fact that the MW is a strongly constrained system, and should be even more
so with the ongoing Gaia survey. We still draw conclusions that apply to the
general case. In particular, we illustrate how neglecting the radial boundary
of the DM halo leads to theoretical inconsistencies. We also show that several
realistic configurations of the DM halo and the MW baryonic content entail
ill-defined DFs, significantly restricting the configuration space over which
these inversion methods can apply. We propose consistent solutions to these
issues. Finally, we compute several observables inferred from constrained
Galactic mass models relevant to DM searches (WIMPs or PBHs), {\em e.g.}
moments and inverse moments of the DM speed and relative speed distributions.

is not always the case. In this paper, we consider so-called complex ranking
settings where it is not clear what should be displayed, that is, what the
relevant items are, and how they should be displayed, that is, where the most
relevant items should be placed. These ranking settings are complex as they
involve both traditional ranking and inferring the best display order. Existing
learning to rank methods cannot handle such complex ranking settings as they
assume that the display order is known beforehand. To address this gap we
introduce a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning method that is capable of
learning complex rankings, both the layout and the best ranking given the
layout, from weak reward signals. Our proposed method does so by selecting
documents and positions sequentially, hence it ranks both the documents and
positions, which is why we call it the Double-Rank Model (DRM). Our experiments
show that DRM outperforms all existing methods in complex ranking settings,
thus it leads to substantial ranking improvements in cases where the display

optimal mean field control problems. Theory for this kind of problems has met
with great success since the early works on mean field games by Lasry and

\cite{Huang}. Generally speaking, the purpose is to understand the continuum
limit of optimizers or of equilibria (say in Nash sense) as the number of
underlying players tends to infinity. When approached from the probabilistic
viewpoint, solutions to these control problems (or games) can be described by
coupled mean field FBSDEs, meaning that the coefficients depend upon the own
marginal laws of the solution. In this note, we detail two methods for solving
such FBSDEs which we implement and apply to five benchmark problems. The first
method uses a tree structure to represent the pathwise laws of the solution,
whereas the second method uses a grid discretization to represent the time
marginal laws of the solutions. Both are based on a Picard scheme; importantly,
we combine each of them with a generic continuation method that permits to
extend the time horizon (or equivalently the coupling strength between the two
equations) for which the Picard iteration converges.

  The soft maximin method provides a range of estimators, controlled by a

maximin estimation. By establishing relevant theoretical properties we argue
that the soft maximin method is both statistically sensibel and computationally
attractive.
  We also demonstrate, on real and simulated data, that the soft maximin

two chiral edge channels with opposite spins propagate in the same direction at

a transition from the QAH to the QSH phase, evinced by characteristic changes

constraints on the extinction from host galaxy dust. We find that that our data
are in agreement with the high $A_V$ and low $R_V$ found in earlier studies

antiferromagnetic Kitaev model in the [001] field by using the Majorana
mean-field theory, in conjunction with the exact diagonalization and the

between the two gapless phases is driven by a topological change of the

The peculiar change of the Majorana band topology is rationalized by a sign
change of the effective Kitaev coupling by the magnetic field, which does not
occur in the ferromagnetic Kitaev case. Upon tilting the magnetic field away
from [001], the two gapless phases become gapped and topologically nontrivial,
characterized by nonzero Chern numbers with different signs. The sign change of

receiver Bob over an adversarially jammed binary channel. An active adversary
James eavesdrops on their communication over a binary symmetric channel
(BSC(q)), and may maliciously flip (up to) a certain fraction p of their
transmitted bits based on his observations. We consider a setting where the
communication must be simultaneously covert as well as reliable, i.e., James
should be unable to accurately distinguish whether or not Alice is

with high probability regardless of the adversarial jamming strategy. We show
that, unlike the setting with passive adversaries, covert communication against
active adversaries requires Alice and Bob to have a shared key (of length at

lower and upper bounds on the information-theoretically optimal throughput as a
function of the channel parameters, the desired level of covertness, and the

electron systems. In particular, it has been argued that it is an appropriate
model to describe the cuprate high-Tc superconductors. It turns out that a
comprehensive understanding of the gamut of physics encoded by the t-J model is
still an open problem. In recent years some remarkable experiments on the
cuprates, for example, discovery of nodeless superconductivity in underdoped
samples (PNAS 109, 18332 (2012)), discovery of s-wave like gap in the pseudogap
phase (Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 107001 (2013)), and observation of polar Kerr
effect (PKE) (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 047003 (2014)), have thrown up new
challenges for this model. Here, we present results demonstrating that, within
the slave-particle formulation of the t-J model, the d-wave superconductor is
unstable at low doping to its own anti-symmetric phase mode fluctuations when
the effect of fluctuations is treated self-consistently. We then show that this
instability gives way to a time reversal symmetry broken d + is-SC in the
underdoped region which has superfluid stiffness consistent with Uemura
relation, even with a large pair amplitude. We show that our results are
consistent with existing experiments on cuprates and suggest that Josephson
(SQUID interferometry) experiments can clearly distinguish the d+is-SC from a
host of other possibilities alluded to be contributing to the physics of
underdoped cuprates. We also comment on other theoretical studies vis-a-vis
ours.

ability to compute the global statistics by using local pairwise communications
among nodes. Simple execution, robustness to topology changes, and distributed
nature make these algorithms quite suitable for wireless sensor networks (WSN).
However, these algorithms converge to the global statistics after certain
rounds of pair-wise communications. A significant challenge for periodic gossip
algorithms is difficult to predict the convergence rate for large-scale
networks. To facilitate the convergence rate evaluation, we study a
one-dimensional lattice network model. In this scenario, to derive the explicit
formula for convergence rate, we have to obtain a closed form expression for
second largest eigenvalue of perturbed pentadiagonal matrices. In our approach,
we derive the explicit expressions of eigenvalues by exploiting the theory of
recurrent sequences. Unlike the existing methods in the literature, this is a
direct method which avoids the theory of orthogonal polynomials [18]. Finally,
we derive the explicit expressions for convergence rate of the average periodic
gossip algorithm in one-dimensional WSNs. We analyze the convergence rate by
considering the linear weight updating approach and investigate the impact of
gossip weights on the convergence rates for a different number of nodes.
Further, we also study the effect of link failures on the convergence rate for
average periodic gossip algorithms.

  problem related to liquid crystals","14 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a Q-tensor problem modeling the dynamic of nematic liquid crystals
in 3D domains. The system consists of the Navier-Stokes equations, with an
extra stress tensor depending on the elastic forces of the liquid crystal,
coupled with an Allen-Cahn system for the Q-tensor variable. This problem has a
dissipative in time free-energy which leads, in particular, to prove the
existence of global in time weak solutions. We analyze the large-time behavior
of the weak solutions. By using a Lojasiewicz-Simon's result, we prove the
convergence as time goes to infinity of the whole trajectory to a single
equilibrium.

time-periodic driving in such a way that it acquires interesting novel
properties. It has been employed, for instance, for the realization of
artificial magnetic fluxes in optical lattices and, typically, it is based on
two approximations. First, the driving frequency is assumed to be low enough to
suppress resonant excitations to high-lying states above some energy gap
separating a low energy subspace from excited states. Second, the driving
frequency is still assumed to be large compared to the energy scales of the
low-energy subspace, so that also resonant excitations within this space are
negligible. Eventually, however, deviations from both approximations will lead
to unwanted heating on a time scale $\tau$. Using the example of a
one-dimensional system of repulsively interacting bosons in a shaken optical
lattice, we investigate the optimal frequency (window) that maximizes $\tau$.
As a main result, we find that, when increasing the lattice depth, $\tau$
increases faster than the experimentally relevant time scale given by the
tunneling time $\hbar/J$, so that Floquet heating becomes suppressed.

for effective uniformization for classes of relations and functions that can be

  We consider the synthesis problem for automatic relations over finite words
(also called regular or synchronized rational relations) by functions
implemented by specific classes of sequential transducers.
  It is known that the problem ""Given an automatic relation, does it have a
uniformization by a subsequential transducer?"" is decidable in the two variants
where the uniformization can either be implemented by an arbitrary
subsequential transducer or it has to be implemented by a synchronous
transducer. We introduce a new variant of this problem in which the allowed
input/output behavior of the subsequential transducer is specified by a set of
synchronizations and prove decidability for a specific class of
synchronizations.

The sign of the second derivative of the environmental spectral density

sufficient condition to distinguish between the quantum Zeno (negative) and the
anti-Zeno (positive) effects raised by the measurements. We check our criterion
for practical measurement intervals, which are larger than the conceptual Zeno
time, in various environments. In particular, with the Lorentzian spectrum, the
quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno phenomena are found to emerge respectively in the
near-resonant and off-resonant cases. For the interacting spectra of
hydrogenlike atoms, the quantum Zeno effect usually occurs and the anti-Zeno
effect can rarely occur unless the transition frequency is close to the cut-off

molten metal or the other liquid material there is a problem to determine a
profile of a film surface. It is subject of this paper. We developed the
mathematical model for the simulation of the adhering process of viscous liquid
film to a slowly moving plate, which is vertically withdrawn from the molten
metal or the other fluid capacity. The Navier-Stokes equations for a film flow
on a surface of the withdrawn plate are considered with the corresponding
boundary conditions, and the polynomial approximation is used for the film flow
profile. The equations after integration across the layer of a film flow result
in the system of partial differential equations for the wavy surface of a film
flow, of flow rate and of flow energy.The derived equations are used for
analysis of the nonlinear film flow that determines the quality of a fluid

to nonperturbative initial-state and final-state transverse momentum $k_T$ and
$j_T$ in the azimuthal nearly back-to-back region $\Delta\phi\sim\pi$. In this
region, transverse-momentum-dependent evolution can be studied when several
different hard scales are measured. To have sensitivity to small transverse
momentum scales, nonperturbative momentum widths of $p_{\rm out}$, the
out-of-plane transverse momentum component perpendicular to the trigger
particle, are measured. These widths are used to investigate possible effects
from transverse-momentum-dependent factorization breaking. When accounting for
the longitudinal momentum fraction of the away-side hadron with respect to the
near-side trigger particle, the widths are found to increase with the hard
scale; this is qualitatively similar to the observed behavior in Drell-Yan and
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering interactions. The momentum widths are
also studied as a function of center-of-mass energy by comparing to previous
measurements at $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV. The nonperturbative jet widths also appear
to increase with $\sqrt{s}$ at a similar $x_T$, which is qualitatively
consistent to similar measurements in Drell-Yan interactions. To quantify the
magnitude of any transverse-momentum-dependent factorization breaking effects,
calculations will need to be performed to compare to these measurements.

alternative for the electron charge. Its long-term goal is in the development
of beyond-Moore low dissipation technology devices. Recent progress
demonstrated the long-distance transport of spin signals across ferromagnetic
insulators. Antiferromagnetically ordered materials are however the most common
class of magnetic materials with several crucial advantages over ferromagnetic
systems. In contrast to the latter, antiferromagnets exhibit no net magnetic
moment, which renders them stable and impervious to external fields. In
addition, they can be operated at THz frequencies. While fundamentally their
properties bode well for spin transport, previous indirect observations
indicate that spin transmission through antiferromagnets is limited to short
distances of a few nanometers. Here we demonstrate the long-distance, over tens
of micrometers, propagation of spin currents through hematite (\alpha-Fe2O3),
the most common antiferromagnetic iron oxide, exploiting the spin Hall effect
for spin injection. We control the spin current flow by the interfacial
spin-bias and by tuning the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency with an
external magnetic field. This simple antiferromagnetic insulator is shown to
convey spin information parallel to the compensated moment (N\'eel order) over
distances exceeding tens of micrometers. This newly-discovered mechanism
transports spin as efficiently as the net magnetic moments in the best-suited
complex ferromagnets. Our results pave the way to ultra-fast, low-power
antiferromagnet-insulator-based spin-logic devices that operate at room
temperature and in the absence of magnetic fields.

However, multi-domain image generation may not achieve the desired performance

tackle this problem, we propose Regularized Conditional GAN (RegCGAN) which is

regularizers to guide the model to learn the corresponding semantics of
different domains. We evaluate the proposed model on several tasks for which

its high efficiency of computation and storage in image retrieval. Recent works
have demonstrated the superiority of simultaneous feature representations and
hash functions learning with deep neural networks. However, most existing deep
hashing methods directly learn the hash functions by encoding the global
semantic information, while ignoring the local spatial information of images.
The loss of local spatial structure makes the performance bottleneck of hash
functions, therefore limiting its application for accurate similarity
retrieval. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Ordinal Hashing (DOH) method,
which learns ordinal representations by leveraging the ranking structure of
feature space from both local and global views. In particular, to effectively
build the ranking structure, we propose to learn the rank correlation space by
exploiting the local spatial information from Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
and the global semantic information from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
simultaneously. More specifically, an effective spatial attention model is
designed to capture the local spatial information by selectively learning
well-specified locations closely related to target objects. In such hashing
framework,the local spatial and global semantic nature of images are captured
in an end-to-end ranking-to-hashing manner. Experimental results conducted on
three widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed DOH method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

  In this paper, a study was carried out by means of mathematical modelling of
the processes of water vapor interaction with suffering pore of the cylindrical
type. The calculations were performed using a model of a hybrid type combining
a molecular-dynamic and a macro-diffusion approach for describing water vapor
interaction with an individual pore. The processes of evolution to the state of
thermodynamic equilibrium of macroscopic characteristics of the system such as
temperature, density, and pressure, depending on external conditions with
respect to pore, were explored. The dependence of the evolution parameters on
the distribution of the diffusion coefficient in the pore, obtained as a result
of molecular dynamics modelling, is examined. The relevance of these studies is
due to the fact that all methods and programs used for the modelling of the
moisture and heat conductivity are based on the use of transport equations in a
porous material as a continuous medium with known values of the transport
coefficients, which are usually obtained experimentally.

magnetoresistance and strongly reinforced superconductivity under pressure.
Here, we demonstrate that a novel mesoscopic superconductivity at ambient
pressure arises on the surface of MoTe2 with a critical temperature up to 5 K
significantly exceeding the bulk Tc=0.1K. We measured the derivatives of I-V
curves for metallic hetero-contacts of MoTe2 with Ag or Cu, homo-contacts of
MoTe2 as well as ""soft"" point contacts (PCs). Large number of these
hetero-contacts exhibit a dV/dI dependence, which is characteristic for Andreev
reflection. It allows to determine the superconducting gap \Delta. The average
gap values are 2\Delta=1.30+/-0.15 meV with a 2\Delta/kBTc ratio of 3.7+/-0.4,
which slightly exceeds the standard BCS value of 3.52. Furthermore, the
temperature dependence of the gap follows a BCS-like behavior, which points to
a nodeless superconducting order parameter with some strong-coupling
renormalization. Remarkably, the observation of a ""gapless-like"" single minimum
in the dV/dI of ""soft"" PCs may indicate a topological superconducting state of
the MoTe2 surface as these contacts probe mainly the interface and avoid
additional pressure effect. Therefore, MoTe2 might be a suitable material to
study new forms of topological superconductivity.

results of the comparative validation study. Based on the results of the
validation study, we arrive at the conclusion that modern deep learning
approaches outperform other methods in instrument segmentation tasks, but the
results are still not perfect. Furthermore, we show that merging results from
different methods actually significantly increases accuracy in comparison to
the best stand-alone method. On the other hand, the results of the instrument
tracking task show that this is still an open challenge, especially during

0.13$\pm$0.02~M$_{\oplus}$ while the unresolved millimetre peak at the stellar

around the stellar position with a peak at 1.1"" distance and a P.A. of
-33$^\circ$. The gas is detected as far as 220$\pm$10~au, a radial separation
the same as that of the mm ring. Assuming optically thin emission and standard
ISM abundances, we use our $^{13}$CO data to derive the gas mass in the disc of
(6.0$\pm$0.9) $\times 10^{-4}~$M$_\odot$. Comparison to published $^{12}$CO
data shows that $^{12}$CO is optically thick, explaining why estimates based on

sub-pc to kpc-scales. Because of its proximity and large mass of the central
black hole, it is one of the best radio sources to study jet formation. We aim
at studying the physical conditions near the jet base at projected separations
from the BH of $\sim7-100$ Schwarzschild radii ($R_{\rm sch}$). Global mm-VLBI
Array (GMVA) observations at 86 GHz ($\lambda=3.5\,$mm) provide an angular
resolution of $\sim50\mu$as, which corresponds to a spatial resolution of only
$7~R_{\rm sch}$ and reach the small spatial scale. We use five GMVA data sets
of M87 obtained during 2004--2015 and present new high angular resolution VLBI
maps at 86GHz. In particular, we focus on the analysis of the brightness
temperature, the jet ridge lines, and the jet to counter-jet ratio. The imaging
reveals a parabolically expanding limb-brightened jet which emanates from a
resolved VLBI core of $\sim(8-13) R_{\rm sch}$ size. The observed brightness
temperature of the core at any epoch is $\sim(1-3)\times10^{10}\,$K, which is
below the equipartition brightness temperature and suggests magnetic energy
dominance at the jet base. We estimate the diameter of the jet at its base to
be $\sim5 R_{\rm sch}$ assuming a self-similar jet structure. This suggests
that the sheath of the jet may be anchored in the very inner portion of the
accretion disk. The image stacking reveals faint emission at the center of the
edge-brightened jet on sub-pc scales. We discuss its physical implication
within the context of the spine-sheath structure of the jet.

fields on (near-)extremal static black hole spacetimes. We start with, as our
background, a rather generic class of warped product metrics, and classify the
field variables into the vector(axial)- and scalar(polar)-type components. On
this generic background, we show that for the vector-type components, the Proca
equation reduces to a single master equation, whereas the scalar-type
components remain to be coupled. Then, focusing on the case of (near-)extremal
static black holes in four-dimensions, we consider the near-horizon expansion
of both the background geometry and massive vector field by a scaling parameter
$\lambda$ with the leading-order geometry being the so called near-horizon
geometry. We show that on the near-horizon geometry, thanks to its enhanced
symmetry, the Proca equation for the scalar-type components also reduces to a
set of two mutually decoupled homogeneous wave equations for two variables,
plus a coupled equation through which the remaining variable is determined.
Therefore, together with the vector-type master equation, we obtain the set of
three decoupled master wave equations, which govern the three independent
dynamical degrees of freedom of the massive vector field in four-dimensions. We
further expand the geometry and massive vector field with respect to $\lambda$
and show that at each order, the Proca equation for the scalar-type components
can reduce to a set of decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations whose source
terms consist only of the lower-order variables, plus one coupled equation that
determins the remaining variable. Therefore, if one solves the master equations
on the leading-order near-horizon geometry, then in principle one can
successively solve the Proca equation at any order.

generating images with a particular subset of modalities, e.g., an image class.
Instead of incorporating a separate step of handcrafted clustering of multiple

appropriate generator network for a given condition. We adopt the categorical

route for the large-scale production of phosphorene and few-layer BP (FL-BP)
flakes. The exploitation of this exfoliated material in cutting-edge
technologies, e.g., in flexible electronics and energy storage, is however
limited by the fact that the LPE of BP is usually carried out at a high boiling
point and in toxic solvents. In fact, the solvent residual is detrimental to
device performance in real applications; thus, complete solvent removal is
critical. Here, we tackle these issues by exfoliating BP in different low
boiling-point solvents. Among these solvents, we find that acetone also
provides a high concentration of exfoliated BP, leading to the production of
FL-BP flakes with an average lateral size and thickness of c.a. 30 and 7 nm,
respectively. The use of acetone to produce less defective few-layer BP flakes
(FL-BPacetone) from bulk crystals is a straightforward process which enables
the rapid preparation of homogeneous thin films thanks to the fast solvent
evaporation. The ratio of edge to bulk atoms for the BP flakes here produced,
combined with the use of low-boiling-point solvents for the exfoliation process
suggests that these thin films are promising anodes for lithium-ion batteries.
To this end, we tested Li-ion half cells with FL-BPacetone anodes achieving a
reversible specific capacity of 480 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g,
over 100 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, a reversible specific capacity of
345 mAh/g is achieved for the FL-BPacetone-based anode at a high current
density (i.e., 1 A/g). These findings indicate that the FL-BPacetone-based
battery is promising with regards to the design of fast charge/discharge
devices. Overall, the presented process is a step forward toward the
fabrication of phosphorene-based devices.

$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, we develop a theory for magnetoelectric (ME) effects in Mott
insulators of $d^5$ transition metal ions in an octahedral crystal field. For
$4d$ and $5d$ compounds, the relatively wide-spread orbitals favor charge
fluctuations of localized electrons to neighboring ions and a significant ME
effect from electronic mechanisms is expected. From a three-orbital Hubbard
model with strong spin-orbit coupling, we derive the mechanisms for the
electric polarization originating from virtual hopping of the localized holes
carrying the spins. We consider the electric polarization generated by pairs of
spin operators on nearest neighbor bonds with either an edge-sharing geometry
(i.e., two ligands are shared) or a corner-sharing geometry (i.e., one ligand
is shared). The allowed couplings are first derived using a symmetry approach.
Then, we explicitly calculate the coupling constants and evaluate the effective
polarization operator in the ground state manifold using perturbation theory
and exact diagonalization. The results are relevant when considering the THz
optical conductivity of magnetic systems such as some perovskite iridates or

interactions are known to harbour a quantum critical point at half-filling,
with critical behaviour in the Gross-Neveu (chiral Ising) universality class.
The critical interaction strength separates a weak-coupling semimetallic regime
from a commensurate charge-density-wave phase. The phase diagram of this basic
model of correlated fermions on the honeycomb lattice beyond half-filling is,
however, less well established. Here, we perform an analysis of its many-body
instabilities using the functional renormalization group method with a basic
Fermi surface patching scheme, which allows us to treat instabilities in
competing channels on equal footing also away from half-filling. Between
half-filling and the van-Hove filling, the free Fermi surface is hole-like and
we again find a charge-density wave instability to be dominant at large
interactions. Moreover, its characteristics are those of the half-filled case.
Directly at the van-Hove filling the nesting property of the free Fermi surface
stabilizes a dimerized bond-order phase. At lower filling the free Fermi
surface becomes electron-like and a superconducting instability with $f$-wave
symmetry is found to emerge from the interplay of intra-unitcell repulsion and
collective fluctuations in the proximity to the charge-density wave
instability. We estimate the extent of the various phases and extract the
corresponding order parameters from the effective low-energy Hamiltonians.

dual-polarization FBMC (DP-FBMC). Using this system we can significantly
suppress the FBMC intrinsic interference. Therefore in DP-FBMC all the
multicarrier techniques used in CP-OFDM systems such as channel equalization,

required for conventional FBMC. DP-FBMC also has other interesting advantages
over CP-OFDM and FBMC: it is more robust in highly dispersive channels, and
also to receiver carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing offset (TO). In our
DP-FBMC system we propose three different structures based on different
multiplexing techniques. We show that compared to conventional FBMC, one of
these DP-FBMC structures has equivalent complexity and equipment requirements.
We compare DP-FBMC with other systems through simulations. According to our

backaction cooling---has become the basis for a range of novel phenomena within
the burgeoning field of cavity optomechanics, spanning from dissipation
engineering to quantum state preparation. As this field moves toward more
complex systems and dynamics, there has been growing interest in the prospect
of cooling traveling-wave phonons in continuous optomechanical waveguides.
Here, we demonstrate optomechanical cooling in a continuous system for the
first time. By leveraging the dispersive symmetry breaking produced by
inter-modal Brillouin scattering, we achieve continuous mode optomechanical
cooling in an extended 2.3-cm silicon waveguide, reducing the temperature of a
band of traveling-wave phonons by more than 30 K from room temperature. This
work reveals that optomechanical cooling is possible in macroscopic linear
waveguide systems without an optical cavity or discrete acoustic modes.
Moreover, through an intriguing type of wavevector-resolved phonon
spectroscopy, we show that this system permits optomechanical control over
continuously accessible groups of phonons and produces a new form of
nonreciprocal reservoir engineering. Beyond this study, this work represents a
first step towards a range of novel classical and quantum traveling-wave
operations in continuous optomechanical systems.

We perform a detailed observational analysis of network jets to

the transition-region (TR). In addition, we have also used Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamic Observation (SDO) observations. Results.
The statistical analysis of fifty-one network jets is performed to understand
various their mean properties, e.g., apparent speed (140.16+/-39.41 km/s),
length (3.16+/-1.18 Mm), lifetimes (105.49+/-51.75 s). The Si iv 1393.75 \AA
line has secondary component along with its main Gaussian, which is formed due
to the high-speed plasma flows (i.e., network jets). The variation of Doppler
velocity across these jets (i.e., blue shift on one edge and red shift on the
other) signify the presence of inherited rotational motion. The statistical
analysis predicts that the mean rotational velocity (i.e., \delV) is 49.56
km/s. The network jets have high angular velocity in comparison to the other
class of solar jets. Conclusions. The signature of network jets are inherited
in TR spectral lines in terms of the secondary component of the Si iv 1393.75
\AA line. The rotational motion of network jets is omnipresent, which is
reported firstly for this class of jet-like features. The magnetic reconnection

classification using a single CNN. The original SSD struggles in detecting very
small objects, which is essential for traffic light detection. By our
adaptations it is possible to detect objects much smaller than ten pixels

employs a quadratic penalty method to enforce the obstacle avoidance

The quadratic penalty method itself aids in avoiding such local minima by
gradually finding a path around the obstacle as the penalty factors are
successively increased. The inner optimization problems are solved in real time
using the proximal averaged Newton-type method for optimal control (PANOC), a
first-order method which exhibits low runtime and is suited for embedded
applications. The method is validated by extensive numerical simulations and
shown to outperform state-of-the-art solvers in runtime and robustness.

Then, for the sake of comparison, we introduce a second scheduling method based

allocation problems with a diseconomy of scale. In an online resource
allocation problem, we are given a set of resources and a set of requests that
arrive in an online manner. Each request consists of a set of feasible
allocations and an allocation is a set of resources. The total cost of an
allocation vector is given by the sum of the resources' costs, where each
resource's cost depends on the total load on the resource under the allocation
vector. We analyze the natural online procedure where each request is allocated
greedily to a feasible set of resources that minimizes the individual cost of
that particular request. In the literature, this algorithm is also known as a
one-round walk-in congestion games starting from the empty state. For
unweighted resource allocation problems with polynomial cost functions with
maximum degree $d$, upper bounds on the competitive ratio of this greedy

this channel: The sum DoF is characterized when $p\le \frac{1}{2}$ or when
$\frac{\min(M,N)}{\max(M,N)} \le \frac{2}{3}$. In the remaining regime, the
lower bound is within $5.2\%$ of the upper bound. Strictly higher DoF is
achieved by coding across channel topologies. In particular, codes over as many

the code design and to elucidate the fact that these are space-time codes,

the classical one, where agents move toward weighted averages of their

switch as a function of time. The dynamics of the lifted variables are governed
by a nonlinear consensus protocol for which the weights contain ratios of the
norms of state variables. We generalize previous convergence results for
hemispheres. For a large class of consensus protocols defined for switching
uniformly quasi-strongly connected time-varying graphs, we show that the
consensus manifold is uniformly asymptotically stable relative to closed balls
contained in a hemisphere. Compared to earlier projection based approaches used
in this context such as the gnomonic projection, which is defined for
hemispheres only, the lifting method applies globally. With that, the hope is
that this method can be useful for future investigations on global convergence.

of mass accreted onto the secondary star of the binary system Eta Carinae,
exploring two sets of stellar masses that had been proposed for the system, the
conventional mass model ($M_1=120 M_{\odot}$ and $M_2=30 M_{\odot}$) and the
high mass model ($M_1=170 M_{\odot}$ and $M_2=80 M_{\odot}$). The system
consists of two very massive stars in a highly eccentric orbit. Every cycle
close to periastron passage the system experiences a spectroscopic event during
which many lines change their appearance, accompanied by a decline in x-ray
emission associated with the destruction wind collision structure and accretion
of the primary wind onto the secondary. We take four different numerical
approaches to simulate the response of the secondary wind to accretion. Each
affects the mass loss rate of the secondary differently, and in turn determines
the amount of accreted mass. The high mass model gives for most approaches much
more accreted gas and a longer accretion phase. We find that the effective
temperature of the secondary can be significantly reduced due to accretion. We
also test different eccentricity values and a higher primary mass loss rate and
find their effect on the duration of the spectroscopic event. We conclude that
the high mass model is better compatible with the amount of accreted mass,
$\approx 3 \times 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$, required for explaining the reduction in
secondary ionization photons during the spectroscopic event and compatible with
its observed duration.

M$, the sought-after tetraquarks $T^{\{bb\}}_{[\bar q \bar q^\prime]}$ as well
as the double-bottom baryons,~$\Xi_{bb}^{0,-}$, and $\Omega_{bb}^-$, can be

present an estimate of their lifetimes using the heavy quark expansion,
yielding $\tau(T^{\{bb\}}_{[\bar q \bar q^\prime]}) \simeq 800$~fs. Measuring
the tetraquark masses would require decays, such as $T^{\{bb\} -}_{[\bar u \bar

$T^{\{bb\} -}_{[\bar u \bar s]} \to \Xi_{bc}^0 \Sigma^-$, and $T^{\{bb\}
0}_{[\bar d \bar s]} \to \Xi_{bc}^0 \bar\Sigma^0$, with subsequent decay chains
in exclusive non-leptonic final states. We estimate a couple of the decay
widths and find that the product branching ratios do not exceed~$10^{-5}$.
Hence, a good fraction of these modes will be required for a discovery of

to moment assumptions concerning the error distribution in a wide variety of
finite-dimensional statistical problems; generally only a second moment
assumption is required for least squares estimators to maintain the same rate
of convergence that they would satisfy if the errors were assumed to be
Gaussian. In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the robustness
of shape-restricted least squares estimators (LSEs) to error distributions with
an $L_{2,1}$ moment, in terms of the `localized envelopes' of the model.
  This envelope perspective gives a systematic approach to proving oracle
inequalities for the LSEs in shape-restricted regression problems in the random
design setting, under a minimal $L_{2,1}$ moment assumption on the errors. The
canonical isotonic and convex regression models, and a more challenging
additive regression model with shape constraints are studied in detail.
Strikingly enough, in the additive model both the adaptation and robustness
properties of the LSE can be preserved, up to error distributions with an
$L_{2,1}$ moment, for estimating the shape-constrained proxy of the marginal
$L_2$ projection of the true regression function. This holds essentially
regardless of whether or not the additive model structure is correctly
specified.
  The new envelope perspective goes beyond shape constrained models. Indeed, at
a general level, the localized envelopes give a sharp characterization of the
convergence rate of the $L_2$ loss of the LSE between the worst-case rate as
suggested by the recent work of the authors [25], and the best possible

Such an assumption can make good sense for a camera mounted on a robot arm, but
not for hand-held or body-mounted cameras. Our experiments show that split

sleep deprivation impacts the performance of novice software developers using
the agile practice of test-first development (TFD). We recruited 45
undergraduates and asked them to tackle a programming task. Among the
participants, 23 agreed to stay awake the night before carrying out the task,
while 22 slept usually. We analyzed the quality (i.e., the functional
correctness) of the implementations delivered by the participants in both
groups, their engagement in writing source code (i.e., the amount of activities
performed in the IDE while tackling the programming task) and ability to apply
TFD (i.e., the extent to which a participant can use this practice). By
comparing the two groups of participants, we found that a single night of sleep
deprivation leads to a reduction of 50% in the quality of the implementations.
There is important evidence that the developers' engagement and their prowess
to apply TFD are negatively impacted. Our results also show that sleep-deprived
developers make more fixes to syntactic mistakes in the source code. We
conclude that sleep deprivation has possibly disruptive effects on software
development activities. The results open opportunities for improving
developers' performance by integrating the study of sleep with other
psycho-physiological factors in which the software engineering research
community has recently taken an interest in.

regulatory networks with high-dimensional gene expression data. Most existing
methods for Gaussian graphical models assume that the data are homogeneous,

many real problems, the data are heterogeneous, which may contain some
subgroups or come from different resources. This paper proposes to model the
heterogeneous data using a mixture Gaussian graphical model, and apply the
imputation-consistency algorithm, combining with the $\psi$-learning algorithm,
to estimate the parameters of the mixture model and cluster the samples to
different subgroups. An integrated Gaussian graphical network is learned across
the subgroups along with the iterations of the imputation-consistency
algorithm. The proposed method is compared with an existing method for learning
mixture Gaussian graphical models as well as a few other methods developed for
homogeneous data, such as graphical Lasso, nodewise regression and
$\psi$-learning. The numerical results indicate superiority of the proposed
method in all aspects of parameter estimation, cluster identification and
network construction. The numerical results also indicate generality of the
proposed method: it can be applied to homogeneous data without significant

POSITIONED in FL(3) in the sense that it is invariant under the natural dual
automorphism of Fl(3) that keeps each of the three free generators fixed. Now
we move to the furthest in terms of symmetry by constructing a selfdually
positioned sublattice $S\cong$ FL$(\omega)$ of FL(3) such that every element of
$S$ is fixed by all automorphisms of FL(3). That is, in our terminology, we
embed FL$(\omega)$ into FL(3) in a TOTALLY SYMMETRIC way. Our main result
determines all pairs $(\kappa,\lambda)$ of cardinals greater than 2 such that
FL$(\kappa)$ is embeddable into FL$(\lambda)$ in a totally symmetric way. Also,
we relax the stipulations on $S\cong$FL$\kappa$ by requiring only that $S$ is
closed with respect to the automorphisms of FL$(\lambda)$, or $S$ is selfdually
positioned and closed with respect to the automorphisms; we determine the
corresponding pairs $(\kappa,\lambda)$ even in these two cases. We reaffirm
some of our calculations with a computer program developed by the first author.

an adaptive attentional module to focus attention on the most discriminative
parts in the single skeleton. To exploit the complementarity from different
geometries in the skeleton for sufficient relational modeling, we design a
two-stream architecture to learn the structural features among joints and lines
simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular skeleton
datasets and the results show that the proposed approach achieves better
results than most mainstream methods.

routinely observes the Sun at several frequencies in the 4-8 GHz range with an
angular resolution of 1-2 arc minutes and an imaging interval of about 12
seconds. With limited opportunities of the incomplete antenna configuration, a
high sensitivity of about 100 Jy allows the SRH to contribute to the studies of
eruptive phenomena along three lines. First, some eruptions are directly
visible in SRH images. Second, some small eruptions are detectable even without
a detailed imaging information from microwave depressions caused by screening
the background emission by cool erupted plasma. Third, SRH observations reveal
new aspects of some events to be studied with different instruments. We focus
on an eruptive C2.2 flare on 16 March 2016 around 06:40, one of the first
flares observed by the SRH. Proceeding from SRH observations, we analyze this
event using extreme-ultraviolet, hard X-ray, white-light, and metric radio
data. An eruptive prominence expanded, brightened, and twisted, which indicates
a time-extended process of the flux-rope formation together with the
development of a large coronal mass ejection (CME). The observations rule out a
passive role of the prominence in the CME formation. The abrupt prominence
eruption impulsively excited a blast-wave-like shock, which appeared during the
microwave burst and was manifested in an ""EUV wave"" and Type II radio burst.
The shock wave decayed and did not transform into a bow shock because of the
low speed of the CME. Nevertheless, this event produced a clear proton
enhancement near Earth. Comparison with our previous studies of several events
confirms that the impulsive-piston shock-excitation scenario is typical of
various events.

star formation histories (SFHs) of 607 galaxies at redshifts $z = 0.6-1.0$ and
stellar masses $\gtrsim10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ using a custom full spectrum fitting
algorithm that incorporates the emcee and FSPS packages. We show that the
mass-weighted age of a galaxy correlates strongly with stellar velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_*$) and ongoing star-formation (SF) activity, with the
stellar content in higher-$\sigma_*$ galaxies having formed earlier and faster.
The SFHs of quiescent galaxies are generally consistent with passive evolution
since their main SF epoch, but a minority show clear evidence of a rejuvenation
event in their recent past. The mean age of stars in galaxies that are
star-forming is generally significantly younger, with SF peaking after $z<1.5$
for almost all star-forming galaxies in the sample: many of these still have
either constant or rising SFRs on timescales $>100$Myrs. This indicates that
$z>2$ progenitors of $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies are generally far less
massive. Finally, despite considerable variance in the individual SFHs, we show
that the current SF activity of massive galaxies ($>$L$_*$) at $z\sim1$
correlates with SF levels at least $3$Gyrs prior: SFHs retain `memory' on a
large fraction of the Hubble time. Our results illustrate a novel approach to
resolve the formation phase of galaxies, and in identifying their individual
evolutionary paths, connects progenitors and descendants across cosmic time.
This is uniquely enabled by the high-quality continuum spectroscopy provided by

classes we obtain an interpretation by systems of equations of a ring of
integers $O$ of a finite field extension of either $\mathbb{Q}$ or
$\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, for some prime $p$ and variable $t$. This implies that the
Diophantine problem (decidability of systems of polynomial equations) in $O$ is
Karp-reducible to the same problem in $R$. In several cases we further obtain
an interpretation by systems of equations of the ring $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$ in $R$,
which implies that the Diophantine problem in $R$ is undecidable in this case.
Otherwise, the ring $O$ is a ring of algebraic integers, and then the
long-standing conjecture that $\mathbb{Z}$ is always interpretable by systems
of equations in $O$ carries over to $R$. If true, it implies that the
Diophantine problem in $R$ is also undecidable.
  Some of the classes of f.g. rings studied in this paper are the following:
all associative, commutative, non-unitary rings (a similar statement for the
unitary case was obtained by Eisentraeger); all possibly non-associative,
non-commutative non-unitary rings that are f.g. as an abelian group; and
several classes of f.g. non-commutative rings. Analogous statements are
obtained for algebras over f.g. associative commutative unitary rings.
  Another contribution is the technique by which the aforementioned results are
obtained: We show that given a bilinear map $f: A\times B \to C$ between f.g.
abelian groups (or modules), under mild assumptions, there exists a certain
ring (or algebra) $R$ with nice properties which is interpretable by systems of
equations in the multi-sorted structure $(A,B,C;f)$. This result is not only

the Myerson price, while the second pricing proposes a ""big deal"": pay for all
goods in advance (at the first round) or get nothing. However, when there is an
imbalance between the seller and the buyer in the patience to wait for utility,
we find that the constant pricing, surprisingly, is no longer optimal. First,
it is outperformed by the pricing algorithm ""big deal"", when the seller's
discount rate is lower than the one of the buyer. Second, in the inverse case
of a less patient buyer, we reduce the problem of finding an optimal algorithm
to a multidimensional optimization problem (a multivariate analogue of the
functional used to determine Myerson's price) that does not admit a closed form
solution in general, but can be solved by numerical optimization techniques
(e.g., gradient ones). We provide extensive analysis of numerically found
optimal algorithms to demonstrate that they are non-trivial, may be
non-consistent, and generate larger expected revenue than the constant pricing

and modified by surface wind-waves in the oceanic surface layer, based on a
first-order turbulence closure and including the effect of a vortex force
representing the Stokes drift of the waves. The shear stress is partitioned
between a component due to shear in the current, which is reduced at low
turbulent Langmuir number ($La_t$), and a wave-induced component, which decays
over a depth proportional to the dominant wavelength. The model reproduces the
apparent reduction of the friction velocity and enhancement of the roughness
length estimated from current profiles, detected in a number of studies. These
effects are predicted to intensify as $La_t$ decreases, and are entirely
attributed to non-breaking surface waves. The current profile becomes flatter
for low $La_t$ owing to a smaller fraction of the total shear stress being
supported by the current shear. Comparisons of the model with the comprehensive
dataset provided by the laboratory experiments of Cheung and Street show
encouraging agreement, with the current speed decreasing as the wind speed
increases (corresponding to decreasing $La_t$), if the model is adjusted to
reflect the effects of a full wave spectrum on the intensity and depth of
penetration of the wave-induced stress. A version of the model where the shear
stress decreases to zero over a depth consistent with the measurements
accurately predicts the surface current speed. These results contribute towards
developing physically-based momentum flux parameterizations for the

biases, statistical and systematic errors, and possible correlations between

simulator that mimics a full X-ray spectral fitting analysis on a set of mock
event lists, obtained using SIXTE. We have applied it to three hydrodynamical
simulations of a Coma-like cluster that include the injection of turbulence.
This allowed us to assess the ability of X-IFU to map five physical quantities
in the cluster core: emission measure, temperature, metal abundance, velocity
and velocity dispersion. Finally, starting from our measurements maps, we
computed the 2D structure function (SF) of emission measure fluctuations, $v$
and $w$ and compared them with those derived directly from the simulations. All
quantities match with the input projected values without bias; the systematic
errors were below 5%, except for velocity dispersion whose error reaches about
15%. Moreover, all measurements prove to be statistically independent,
indicating the robustness of the fitting method. Most importantly, we recover
the slope of the SFs in the inertial regime with excellent accuracy, but we

the metric distance probability distribution. For individual galaxies, the most
transparent way to assess the variance of redshift independent distances is to
directly sample the posterior probability distribution obtained from the
mixture of reported measurements. However, sampling the posterior can be
cumbersome for catalog-wide precision cosmology applications. We compare the
performance of frequentist methods versus our proposed measures for estimating
the true variance of the metric distance probability distribution. We provide
pre-computed distance error data tables for galaxies in 3 catalogs: NED-D,
HyperLEDA, and Cosmicflows-3. Additionally, we develop a Bayesian model that
considers systematic and random effects in the estimation of errors for
Tully-Fisher relation (TF) derived distances in NED-D. We validate this model
with a Bayesian $p$-value computed using the Freeman-Tukey discrepancy measure
as a posterior predictive check. We are then able to predict distance errors
for 884 galaxies in the NED-D catalog and 203 galaxies in the HyperLEDA catalog

extinction phase transitions in growth and spreading processes. Uncorrelated
environmental noise (i.e., temporal disorder) was recently shown to give rise
to an unusual infinite-noise critical point [Europhys. Lett. 112, 30002
(2015)]. It is characterized by enormous density fluctuations that increase
without limit at criticality. As a result, a typical population decays much
faster than the ensemble average which is dominated by rare events. Using the
logistic evolution equation as an example, we show here that positively
correlated (red) environmental noise further enhances these effects. This
means, the correlations accelerate the decay of a typical population but slow
down the decay of the ensemble average. Moreover, the mean time to extinction
of a population in the active, surviving phase grows slower than a power law
with population size. To determine the complete critical behavior of the
extinction transition, we establish a relation to fractional random walks, and
we perform extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.

that it induces synchronization for large values of coupling strength at which
the coupled chaotic systems resist synchronization when continu- ously coupled.
However, why this is so is an open problem. To answer this question, we recall
the conventional wisdom that the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the transverse
dynamics measure whether a trajectory at a phase point is locally contracting
or diverging with respect to another nearby trajectory. Subsequently, we go on
to highlight a lesser appreciated fact that even when, under the corresponding
linearised flow, the nearby trajectory asymptotically diverges away, its
distance from the reference trajectory may still be contracting for some
intermediate period. We term this phenomenon transient decay in line with the
phenomenon of the transient growth. Using these facts, we show that an optimal
coupling region, i.e., a region of the phase space where coupling is on, should
ideally be such that at any of the constituent phase point either the maximum
of the real parts of the eigenvalues is negative or the magnitude of the
positive maximum is lesser than that of the negative minimum. We also invent
and employ modified dynamics coupling scheme---a significant improvement over
the well-known dynamic coupling scheme---as a decisive tool to justify our
results.

cannot be improved in general. Finally, we generalize our analysis and improve
extant prediction error bounds for another random forest model in which each

$\mathcal{L}$ of lease types each characterized by a duration and cost, and a
sequence of subsets of $V$ arriving over time. A node can be leased using lease
type $l$ for cost $c_l$ and remains active for time $d_l$. The adversary gives
in each step $t$ a subset of nodes that need to be dominated by a connected

total leasing costs. OCDSL contains the \emph{Parking Permit

\emph{Connected Dominating Set} problem~\cite{Guha1998}. It has an $\Omega(\log

scale factor has been chosen such that the deceleration parameter, obtained

the quantization of amplitudes, which plays a peculiar role for complex systems

reverse shock (RS) and a forward shock (FS). The magnetic field in the narrow

component during the afterglow phase. In this paper, we calculate light curves
and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with this mixed magnetic field
in the RS region of the narrow sub-jet in a two-component jet model. The
resultant light curve has two peaks: an early peak arises from the narrow

field condition. The two-dimensional `mixed' magnetic fields confined in the
shock plane are essentially the ordered magnetic fields only with different

choose the models which are consisting different sets of two seperate fluids.
The first one of each set tries to justify the late time acceleration and the
second one is barotropic fluid. The former model considers our present time
universe to be homogeneously filled up by Generalized Chaplygin Gas which is
interacting with barotropic fluid. On the other hand, the latter model
considers that the cosmic acceleration is generated by Modified Chaplygin Gas
which is interacting with matter depicted by barotropic equation of state. For
both the models, we consider the interaction term to vary proportionally with
Hubble's parameter as well as with the exotic matter/dark energy's energy
density. We find an explicit function form of the energy density of the cosmos
which is found to depend on different cosmological parameters like scale
factor, dark energy and barotropic fluid's EoS parameters and other constants
like interacting constants etc. We draw curves of effective EoS-s, different
cosmological parameters like deceleration parameter $q$, statefinder parameters
$r$ and $s$ with repect to the redshift $z$ (for different values of dark
energy and barotopic fluid parameters) and study them thoroughly. We compare
two models as well as the nature of dependencies on these models' interaction
coefficients. We point out the particular redshift for which the universe may
transit from a deceleration to acceleration phase. We tally all these values
with different observational data. Here we also analyse how this value of
particular redshift does change for different values of interaction
coefficients and different dark energy models.

systems becomes an increasingly complicated problem. With the increasing
complexity the existing control system of power system conditions which
includes operative actions of the dispatcher and work of special automatic
devices proves to be insufficiently effective more and more frequently, which
raises risks of dangerous and emergency conditions in power systems. The paper
is aimed at compensating for the shortcomings of man (a cognitive barrier,
exposure to stresses and so on) and automatic devices by combining their strong
points, i.e. the dispatcher's intelligence and the speed of automatic devices
by virtue of development of the intelligent system ""Artificial dispatcher"" on
the basis of deep machine learning technology. For realization of the system
""Artificial dispatcher"" in addition to deep learning it is planned to attract
the game theory approaches to formalize work of the up-to-date power system as
a game problem. The ""gain"" for ""Artificial dispatcher"" will consist in bringing
in a power system in the normal steady-state or post-emergency conditions by
means of the required control actions.

CMOS-compatible integrated photonics. However, active devices such as

should have a high bandwidth, good modulation efficiency, low loss, and cover a
wide wavelength range. Here, we demonstrate the first electro-optic modulators
based on ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films on SiN, in both the
O- and the C-band. Bias-free operation, bandwidths beyond 33 GHz and data rates
of 40 Gbps are shown, as well as low propagation losses ($\alpha\approx 1$
dB/cm). A $V_\pi L\approx$ 3.2 Vcm is measured. Simulations indicate that
values below 2 Vcm are achievable. This approach offers a much-anticipated
route towards high-performance phase modulators on SiN.

changing the sensing medium refractive index nmed of the structure, the sensing

the transmission characteristics can be adjusted flexibly. The resonance
wavelength remains entirely the same and the transmission dip enhancement over
a big range of incidence angles [0,45] for both TM and TE polarizations, which
indicates that the resonance of the graphene nanoring-strip arrays is
insensitive to angle polarization. The above results are undoubtedly a new way
to realize various tunable plasmon devices, and may have a great application
prospect in biosensing, detection and imaging.

unique and compact approach to generate fields above 2 mega-gauss in less than
150 ns, inside a volume close to half a cubic centimeter. Magnetic insulation,
keeping plasma ablation close to the wire surface, and mechanical inertia,
limiting coil motion throughout the current discharge, enable the generation of
intense magnetic fields where the shape of the conductor controls the field
topology with exquisite precision and versatility, limiting the need for
mapping exactly magnetic fields.

we built seven different MD simulation systems, and each system consisting of

  problems","19 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new variational formulation is herein proposed for the solution of adhesive
contact problems for non-planar profiles of arbitrary shape indenting a
deformable half-plane. The method exploits the original idea of accounting for
the shape of roughness as a correction to the normal gap function, rather than
explicitly discretizing roughness with higher-order numerical interpolation
schemes. The resulting interface finite element with eMbedded Profile for Joint
Roughness (MPJR interface finite element) is derived and its implementation as
a user-defined element is comprehensively described. The method is validated
against Hertzian contact problems between a cylinder and a half-plane, also in
the presence of adhesion, showing a remarkable accuracy in spite of the
low-order interpolation used. The capability and efficiency of the method are
subsequently illustrated in relation to the challenging frictionless normal
contact problems between deformable substrates and rough profiles analytically
described by the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function. This method opens new
perspectives for the solution of contact problems with roughness using the
finite element method that, so far, were strongly limited by the issue of
providing an accurate representation of roughness.

effects of backreaction on the condensation of the scalar hair. For the
analytical method, we employ the Sturm-Liouville eigen value problem and for
the numerical method, we employ the shooting method. We show that these methods
are powerful enough to analyze the critical temperature and phase transition of
the one dimensional holographic superconductor. We find out that increasing the
backreaction as well as nonlinearity makes the condensation harder to form. In
addition, this one-dimensional holographic superconductor faces with second
order phase transition and their critical exponent has the mean field value
$\beta={1}/{2}$.
