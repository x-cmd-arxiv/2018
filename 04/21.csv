structure of the pulsar magnetosphere. In this first of a series of studies, a
3D, computationally intensive, implicit Crank-Nicolson finite-difference scheme
is developed. The region of magnetic influence is evolved under the
approximation of force-free electrodynamics. The main objective of this paper
is to present our code and use it to demonstrate and verify the now widely -
accepted global features of a pulsar magnetosphere. Our results qualitatively
agree with previously developed time-dependent models for an oblique rotator.
In line with earlier studies, we also demonstrate that our simulations can run
for many stellar rotations. Once we extend our code, we believe that our
implicit approach can be extremely useful to investigate magnetospheres filled
with resistive plasma, develop better resolution current sheets and investigate
small scale microphysics of pair creation using particle-in-cell techniques.

effect of non-uniform Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) levels on the spectral
properties of the generated signal is analyzed. It is analytically shown that
the DAC non-uniform levels result in degraded harmonic suppression performance.
Moreover, a new approach is proposed for designing ternary sequences, which is
flexible and can be adapted to suit different requirements. The resulting
sequences, denoted as randomized constrained sequences, are characterized
theoretically by deriving an analytical expression of the power spectral

their respective ability of modelling across scales, and dealing with some of
the specific problems that arise along the way. The main upshot of this article
is to present three main problems facing multi-scale modelling in contemporary
cosmology. The LambdaCDM model, which is the standard and by far most
successful current cosmological model, faces what I call the downscaling
problem when it comes to explain some recalcitrant evidence at the scale of
individual galaxies, such as the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation (MDAR)
and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTF). While the fastgrowing development
of computer simulations has addressed these problems, nagging worries remain
about some of the epistemic limits of these computer simulations in retrieving
(as opposed to explaining) the data. The so-called upscaling problem affects
MOND and its ability not just to explain but even simply retrieve large-scale
structure and galaxy clusters. Recent attempts at extending MOND (EMOND) have
had a limited empirical success, and are still far from providing a consistent
explanation for possible formation mechanisms at the large-scale structure.
Finally, the in between scales problem affects proposals designed to achieve
the best of both worlds at the meso-scale. This is a fascinating area from a
physical and a philosophical point of view, where the main challenge is the
ability to have genuine predictive novelty.

  Seeking to overcome these challenges, this work focuses on the design of

method coefficients should be generic in the step size ratio, but should not
depend strongly on this ratio; unnecessary coupling between the fast and the
slow components should be avoided; and the step size controllers should adjust
both the micro- and the macro-steps.
  Using these criteria, we develop MrGARK schemes of up to order four that are
explicit-explicit (both the fast and slow component are treated explicitly),
implicit-explicit (implicit in the fast component and explicit in the slow
one), and explicit-implicit (explicit in the fast component and implicit in the
slow one). Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of these new

little attention has been paid to the fact that the success of an information

capable of influencing but also are linked to more diverse (groups of) users,
then the influence triggers will be diversified as well, and hence the target
users will get higher chance of being engaged. Upon this intuition, we define a
novel problem, named Diversity-sensitive Targeted Influence Maximization
(DTIM), which assumes to model user diversity by exploiting only topological
information within a social graph. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to bring the concept of topology-driven diversity into targeted IM
problems, for which we define two alternative definitions. Accordingly, we
propose approximate solutions of DTIM, which detect a size-k set of users that
maximizes the diversity-sensitive capital objective function, for a given
selection of target users. We evaluate our DTIM methods on a special case of
user engagement in online social networks, which concerns users who are not
actively involved in the community life. Experimental evaluation on real

shaped by often variable biological and physical environments. While these
variable environments can be modeled implicitly in cases such as host-pathogen
co-evolution, the dynamic environment, and emerging ecology often cannot be

only a single laser shot. A millimeter-scale pre-collision drift allows the
electron beam to expand to a size larger than the laser focal spot and develop
a correlation between transverse position and angular divergence. In contrast
to previous studies, this means that a measurement of the beam's

satellites can influence their thermal, rotational, and orbital evolution, and
the sustainability of oceans. We present a new theoretical treatment for tidal
heating in thin subsurface oceans with overlying incompressible elastic shells
of arbitrary thickness. The stabilizing effect of an overlying shell damps
ocean tides, reducing tidal heating. This effect is more pronounced on
Enceladus than on Europa because the effective rigidity on a small body like
Enceladus is larger. For the range of likely shell and ocean thicknesses of
Enceladus and Europa, the thin shell approximation of Beuthe (2016) is
generally accurate to less than about 4%.The time-averaged surface distribution
of ocean tidal heating is distinct from that due to dissipation in the solid
shell, with higher dissipation near the equator and poles for eccentricity and
obliquity forcing respectively. This can lead to unique horizontal shell
thickness variations if the shell is conductive. The surface displacement
driven by eccentricity and obliquity forcing can have a phase lag relative to
the forcing tidal potential due to the delayed ocean response. For Europa and
Enceladus, eccentricity forcing generally produces greater tidal amplitudes due
to the large eccentricity values relative to the obliquity values. Despite the
small obliquity values, obliquity forcing generally produces larger phase lags
due to the generation of Rossby-Haurwitz waves. If Europa's shell and ocean are
respectively 10 and 100 km thick, the tide amplitude and phase lag are 26.5 m
and $<1$ degree for eccentricity forcing, and $<2.5$ m and $<18$ degrees for
obliquity forcing. Measurement of the obliquity phase lag (e.g. by Europa
Clipper) would provide a probe of ocean thickness

integrability is that scattering of particles is elastic and factorizable.
These properties are the basis for the bootstrap program, which leads to the
exact computation of S-matrices and form factors. We consider
periodically-driven field theories, whose stroboscopic time-evolution is
described by a Floquet Hamiltonian. It was recently proposed by Gritsev and
Polkovnikov that it is possible for some form of integrability to be preserved
even in driven systems. If a driving protocol exists such that the Floquet
Hamiltonian is integrable (such that there is an infinite number of local and
independent charges, a subset of which are parity-even, that commute with it),

particle trajectories, analogous to S-matrix elasticity and factorization. We
propose a new set of axioms for the time evolution of particles which outline a
new bootstrap program, which can be used to identify and classify integrable

the overestimate of the HI extent and total flux of 54$^{\prime}$ and 264
Jy.km.s$^{-1}$ reported for Sextans A using the Effelsberg observations. Tilted
ring models allow us to derive the rotation curves (RCs) of Sextans A and B out
to 550$^{\prime \prime}$ ($\sim$ 3.5 kpc) and 650$^{\prime \prime}$ ($\sim$ 4
kpc) respectively. The RCs of the two galaxies are seen to decline in the outer
parts. The dark matter distribution in Sextans A is better described by the
pseudo-isothermal halo model when a M/L ratio of 0.2 is used. For Sextans B,
the mass model fits are not as good but again an isothermal sphere with a M/L
of 0.2 represents best the data. Using the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND),
better fits are obtained when the constant a$_{0}$ is allowed to vary. The
critical densities for gravitational instabilities are calculated using the
Toomre-$Q$ and cloud-growth based on shear criterion. We find that in regions

signature of the Standard Model Higgs instability is the production of
gravitational waves sourced by Higgs fluctuations generated during inflation.
We fully characterise the two-point correlator of such gravitational waves by
computing its amplitude, the frequency at peak, the spectral index, as well as
their three-point correlators for various polarisations. We show that,
depending on the Higgs and top masses, either LISA or the Einstein Telescope
and Advanced-Ligo, could detect such stochastic background of gravitational
waves. In this sense, collider and gravitational wave physics can provide
fundamental and complementary informations. Furthermore, the consistency
relation among the three- and the two-point correlators could provide an
efficient tool to ascribe the detected gravitational waves to the Standard
Model itself. Since the mechanism described in this paper might also be
responsible for the generation of dark matter under the form of primordial
black holes, this latter hypothesis may find its confirmation through the
detection of gravitational waves.

background medium is modeled in two different ways: (I) we use the UrQMD
hydrodynamics + Boltzmann transport hybrid approach including a phase
transition to QGP and (II) with the coarse-graining approach employing also an
equation of state with QGP. The latter approach has previously been used to
describe di-lepton data at various energies very successfully. This comparison
allows us to explore the effects of partial thermalization and viscous effects
on the charm propagation. We explore the centrality dependencies of the
collisions, the variation of the decoupling temperature and various
hadronization parameters. We find that the initial partonic phase is
responsible for the creation of most of the D mesons elliptic flow and that the
subsequent hadronic interactions seem to play only a minor role. This indicates
that D mesons elliptic flow is a smoking gun for a partonic phase at FAIR
energies. However, the results suggest that the magnitude and the details of
the elliptic flow strongly depend on the dynamics of the medium and on the
hadronization procedure, which is related to the medium properties as well.
Therefore, even at FAIR energies the charm quark might constitute a very useful
tool to probe the Quark-Gluon Plasma and investigate its physics.

sequence stars with good parallaxes ($\sigma_\varpi/\varpi<0.1$) from the
LAMOST $\times$ TGAS $\times$ 2MASS cross-match, yielding a precise
spectroscopic distance estimator with uncertainties of $\sim$6% for single
stars. Unlike previous approaches to this problem, we explicitly account for
the individual parallax uncertainties in the model building and fully
incorporate the fraction of near-equal binaries of main sequence stars, which
would lead to biased distance estimates if neglected. Using this model, we
estimate the distance for all (150,000) main sequence stars from LAMOST Data
Release 5, without parallax information. As an application, we compute their
orbital actions, where our more precise distances result in 5 times smaller
action uncertainties. This illustrates how future studies of the Milky Way's
orbital structure can benefit from using our model. For the fainter and more
distant stars of most current spectroscopic surveys, an approach such as the

gradient of 8.0 km/s/deg (or 18.3 km/s/kpc over at least 3$^{\circ}$ (or 1.3

of the stream implies that Tucana III is likely on a radial orbit. We
successfully obtain metallicities for 4 members in the core and 12 members in
the tails. We find that members close to the ends of the stream tend to be more
metal-poor than members in the core, indicating a possible metallicity gradient
between the center of the progenitor halo and its edge. The spread in
metallicity suggests that the progenitor of the Tucana III stream is a dwarf
galaxy rather than a star cluster. Furthermore, we find that with the precise
photometry of the Dark Energy Survey data, there is a discernible color offset
between metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor stream members. This
metallicity-dependent color offers a more efficient method to recognize
metal-poor targets and will increase the selection efficiency of stream members

discovered Tucana III stream. These fits assume a fixed Milky Way potential and
give proper motion predictions, which can be tested with the upcoming Gaia Data
Release 2. These fits reveal that Tucana III is on an eccentric orbit around
the Milky Way and, more interestingly, that Tucana III passed within 15 kpc of
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) approximately 75 Myr ago. Given this close
passage, we fit the Tucana III stream in the combined presence of the Milky Way
and the LMC. We find that the predicted proper motions depend on the assumed
mass of the LMC and that the LMC can induce a substantial proper motion
perpendicular to the stream track. A detection of this misalignment will
directly probe the extent of the LMC's influence on our Galaxy, and has
implications for nearly all methods which attempt to constraint the Milky Way
potential. Such a measurement will be possible with the upcoming Gaia DR2,
allowing for a measurement of the LMC's mass.

missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars have binary
companions. Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors
in planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in
completeness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs,
making it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates.
Here we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try
and clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate
density measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The
formula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary
stars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and
single stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries
are over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an
idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 $R_\oplus$,
the net systematic error is of order 5%. In particular, unrecognized binaries
are unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot
Jupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the
errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be
overestimated by as much as 50%. We also show that whenever high-resolution
imaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more
likely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.

extinction, the intrinsic RC color and magnitude and their radial dependence
are carefully measured by using internal nearly dust-free regions. These are
then used to construct an accurate 2D reddening map (165 square degrees with
~10 arcmin resolution) of the LMC disk and the 3D spatial distribution of RC
stars. An inclined disk model is fit to the 2D distance map yielding a best-fit
inclination angle i = 25.86(+0.73,-1.39) degrees with random errors of +\-0.19
degrees and line-of-nodes position angle theta = 149.23(+6.43,-8.35) degrees
with random errors of +/-0.49 degrees. These angles vary with galactic radius,
indicating that the LMC disk is warped and twisted likely due to the repeated
tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). For the first time,
our data reveal a significant warp in the southwestern part of the outer disk
starting at rho ~ 7 degrees that departs from the defined LMC plane up to ~4
kpc toward the SMC, suggesting that it originated from a strong interaction
with the SMC. In addition, the inner disk encompassing the off-centered bar
appears to be tilted up to 5-15 degrees relative to the rest of the LMC disk.
These findings on the outer warp and the tilted bar are consistent with the
predictions from the Besla et al. simulation of a recent direct collision with
the SMC.

technically require a likelihood function, or a probability of the (raw-ish)

Unfortunately, we aren't (at present) given access to the Gaia data directly;
we are only given a Catalog of derived astrometric properties for the stars.
How do we perform probabilistic inferences in this context? The answer -
implicit in many publications - is that we should look at the Gaia Catalog as
containing the parameters of a likelihood function, or a probability of the
Gaia data, conditioned on stellar properties, evaluated at the location of the
data. Concretely, my recommendation is to assume (for, say, the parallax) that
the Catalog-reported value and uncertainty are the mean and root-variance of a
Gaussian function that can stand in for the true likelihood function. This is
the implicit assumption in most Gaia literature to date; my only goal here is
to make the assumption explicit. Certain technical choices by the Mission team
slightly invalidate this assumption for DR1 (TGAS), but not seriously.
Generalizing beyond Gaia, it is important to downstream users of any Catalog
products that they deliver likelihood information about the fundamental data;
this is a challenge for the probabilistic catalogs of the future.

complementary insights into how galaxies build-up their stellar mass and
angular momentum. A galaxy's mean stellar age reveals when stars were formed,
but provides little constraint on how the galaxy's mass was assembled. Resolved
stellar dynamics trace the change in angular momentum and orbital distribution
of stars due to mergers, but major mergers tend to obscure the effect of
earlier interactions. With the rise of large multi-object integral field
spectroscopic (IFS) surveys, such as SAMI and MaNGA, and single-object IFS
surveys (e.g., ATLAS$^{\rm{3D}}$, CALIFA, MASSIVE), it is now feasible to
connect a galaxy's star formation and merger history on the same resolved
physical scales, over a large range in galaxy mass, and across the full range
of optical morphology and environment. Using the SAMI Galaxy Survey, here we
present the first study of spatially-resolved stellar kinematics and global
stellar populations in a large IFS galaxy survey. We find a strong correlation
of stellar population age with location in the ($V / \sigma$,
$\epsilon_{\rm{e}}$) diagram that links the ratio of ordered rotation to random
motions in a galaxy to its observed ellipticity. For the large majority of
galaxies that are oblate rotating spheroids, we find that characteristic
stellar age follows the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies remarkably well. This
trend is still observed when galaxies are separated into early-type and
late-type samples.

stream has been freely expanding away due to the tidal disruption of the
globular cluster. This timescale, in turn, places a lower limit on the age of
the cluster. The age can be deduced from astrometry using a modest number of
stars, with the error on this estimate depending on the proximity of the stream

at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the
mid-infrared. Skemer et al. 2016 presented a spectrum of WISE 0855 from 4.5-5.1
micron (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here, we present a spectrum of
WISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4-4.14 micron. We present a set of atmosphere
models that include a range of compositions (metallicities and C/O ratios) and
water ice clouds. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum. The
mid-infrared color can be better matched with a methane abundance that is
depleted relative to solar abundance. We find that there is evidence for water
ice clouds in the M band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral
features in both the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum
opacity source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep
phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of WISE
0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging the
temperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible
exoplanets. JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs

important input features---for example, a heatmap visualization over the words

importance is determined by either input perturbation---measuring the decrease
in model confidence when that word is removed---or by the gradient with respect
to that word. To understand the limitations of these methods, we use input
reduction, which iteratively removes the least important word from the input.
This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words
appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by
interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced
examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models
still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these
counterintuitive results, we draw connections to adversarial examples and
confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in
interpreting neural models trained with maximum likelihood. To mitigate their
deficiencies, we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on
reduced examples. Fine-tuned models become more interpretable under input
reduction without accuracy loss on regular examples.

on the basis of multiscale homogenization. The discrete model considered in
this paper is the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which simulates
concrete at the level of coarse aggregate pieces. In LDPM, the size of the
aggregate particles follows the actual particle size distribution that is used
in experiment to produce concrete specimens. Consequently, modeling large
structural systems entirely with LDPM leads to a tremendous number of degrees
of freedom and is not feasible with the currently available computational
resources. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the formulation of
a coarse-grained model obtained by (1) increasing the actual size of the
particles in the fine-scale model by a specific coarsening factor and (2)
calibrating the parameters of the coarse grained model by best fitting the
macroscopic, average response of the coarse grained model to the corresponding
fine scale one for different loading conditions. A Representative Volume
Element (RVE) of LDPM is employed to obtain the macroscopic response of the
fine scale and coarse grained models through a homogenization procedure.
Accuracy and efficiency of the developed coarse graining method is verified by
comparing the response of fine scale and coarse grained simulations of several
reinforced concrete structural systems in terms of both accuracy of the results
and computational cost.

etc). One simple choice is to treat the table as a sequence of fields and
values and then use a standard seq2seq model for this task. However, such a
model is too generic and does not exploit task-specific characteristics. For
example, while generating descriptions from a table, a human would attend to
information at two levels: (i) the fields (macro level) and (ii) the values
within the field (micro level). Further, a human would continue attending to a
field for a few timesteps till all the information from that field has been
rendered and then never return back to this field (because there is nothing
left to say about it). To capture this behavior we use (i) a fused bifocal
attention mechanism which exploits and combines this micro and macro level
information and (ii) a gated orthogonalization mechanism which tries to ensure
that a field is remembered for a few time steps and then forgotten. We
experiment with a recently released dataset which contains fact tables about
people and their corresponding one line biographical descriptions in English.

soft objects meeting fluid interfaces (elasto-capillary interactions). In this
work we experimentally examine the case of a fluid resting on a thin film of
rigid material which, in turn, is resting on a fluid substrate. To simplify
complexity, we adapt the experiment to a one-dimensional geometry and examine
the behaviour of polystyrene and polycarbonate films directly with confocal
microscopy. We find that the fluid meets the film in a manner consistent with
the Young-Dupr\'e equation when the film is thick, but transitions to what
appears similar to a Neumann like balance when the thickness is decreased.
However, on closer investigation we find that the true contact angle is always
given by the Young construction. The apparent paradox is a result of
macroscopically measured angles not being directly related to true microscopic
contact angles when curvature is present. We model the effect with the
Euler-Bernoulli beam on a Winkler foundation as well as with an equivalent
energy based capillary model. Notably, the models highlight several important
lengthscales and the complex interplay of tension, gravity and bending in the
problem.

cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical high-resolution simulations of Milky
Way-mass galaxies performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We study halo
global properties and radial profiles out to $\sim 150$ kpc for each individual
galaxy. The Auriga haloes are diverse in their masses and density profiles;
mean metallicity and metallicity gradients; ages; and shapes, reflecting the
stochasticity inherent in their accretion and merger histories. A comparison
with observations of nearby late-type galaxies shows very good agreement
between most observed and simulated halo properties. However, Auriga haloes are
typically too massive. We find a connection between population gradients and
mass assembly history: galaxies with few significant progenitors have more
massive haloes, possess large negative halo metallicity gradients and steeper
density profiles. The number of accreted galaxies, either disrupted or under
disruption, that contribute 90% of the accreted halo mass ranges from 1 to 14,
with a median of 6.5, and their stellar masses span over three orders of
magnitude. The observed halo mass--metallicity relation is well reproduced by
Auriga and is set by the stellar mass and metallicity of the dominant satellite
contributors. This relationship is found not only for the accreted component
but also for the total (accreted + in-situ) stellar halo. Our results highlight
the potential of observable halo properties to infer the assembly history of

canting that accompanies the driven population inversion between two

the efforts of feature engineering for training accurate machine learning

distant supervision paradigm empowered by deep representation for extracting
information from clinical text. In this paradigm, the rule-based NLP algorithms
are utilized to generate weak labels and create large training datasets
automatically. Additionally, we use pre-trained word embeddings as deep
representation to eliminate the need of task-specific feature engineering for
machine learning. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm on
two clinical information extraction tasks: smoking status extraction and
proximal femur (hip) fracture extraction. We tested three prevalent machine
learning models, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and Random Forrest (RF). Results: The results indicate that CNN
is the best fit to the proposed distant supervision paradigm. It outperforms
the rule-based NLP algorithms given large datasets by capturing additional
extraction patterns. We also verified the advantage of word embedding feature
representation in the paradigm over term frequency-inverse document frequency
(tf-idf) and topic modeling representations. Discussion: In the clinical
domain, the limited amount of labeled data is always a bottleneck for applying
machine learning. Additionally, the performance of machine learning approaches
highly depends on task-specific feature engineering. The proposed paradigm
could alleviate those problems by leveraging rule-based NLP algorithms to
automatically assign weak labels and eliminating the need of task-specific

entanglement in a hot alkali vapor, in a regime dominated by random
spin-exchange collisions. We use Bayesian statistics and spin-squeezing
inequalities to show that at least $1.52(4)\times 10^{13}$ of the $5.32(12)
\times 10^{13}$ participating atoms enter into singlet-type entangled states,
which persist for tens of spin-thermalization times and span thousands of times
the nearest-neighbor distance. The results show that high temperatures and
strong random interactions need not destroy many-body quantum coherence, that
collective measurement can produce very complex entangled states, and that the
hot, strongly-interacting media now in use for extreme atomic sensing are well
suited for sensing beyond the standard quantum limit.

one or more ingested, input corpuses. These queries require no a priori domain

queries help address the epistemological question of how we know what we know,
or more precisely in this case, how an AI system with ingested data knows what
it knows. These auto-generated queries can also be used to identify and remedy
problem areas in ingested material -- areas for which the knowledge of the AI
system is incomplete or even erroneous. Similarly, the proposed techniques
facilitate tests of AI capability -- both in terms of coverage and accuracy. By
removing humans from the main learning loop, our approach also allows more
effective scaling of AI and cognitive capabilities to provide (1) broader
coverage in a single domain such as health or geology; and (2) more rapid
deployment to new domains. The proposed techniques also allow ingested
knowledge to be extended naturally. Our investigations are early, and this

Counting is a common problem in computer vision (e.g. traffic on the street or
pedestrians in a crowd). Modern approaches to the counting problem involve the
production of a density map via regression whose integral is equal to the
number of objects in the image. However, objects in the image can occur at
different scales (e.g. due to perspective effects) which can make it difficult
for a learning agent to learn the proper density map. While the use of multiple
columns to extract multiscale information from images has been shown before,
our approach aggregates the multiscale information gathered by the multicolumn
convolutional neural network to improve performance. Our experiments show that
our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmark
datasets, and also that using our aggregation module in combination with a
higher number of columns is beneficial for multiscale counting.

the project Seeds Of Life In Space (SOLIS). In addition, IRAM-30m data
observations were used to investigate the physical structure of OMC-2 FIR\,4.
We find that the c-C$_3$H$_2$ gas emits from the same region where previous
SOLIS observations showed bright HC$_5$N emission. From a non-LTE analysis of
the IRAM-30m data, the c-C$_3$H$_2$ gas has an average temperature of
$\sim$40K, a H$_2$ density of $\sim$3$\times$10$^{5}$~cm$^{-3}$, and a
c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance relative to H$_2$ of ($7\pm1$)$\times$10$^{-12}$. In
addition, the NOEMA observations provide no sign of significant c-C$_3$H$_2$
excitation temperature gradients across the region (about 3-4 beams), with
T$_{ex}$ in the range 8$\pm$3 up to 16$\pm$7K. We thus infer that our
observations are inconsistent with a physical interaction of the OMC-2 FIR\,4
envelope with the outflow arising from OMC-2 FIR\,3, as claimed by previous
studies. The comparison of the measured c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance with the
predictions from an astrochemical PDR model indicates that OMC-2 FIR\,4 is
irradiated by a FUV field $\sim$1000 times larger than the interstellar one,
and by a flux of ionising particles $\sim$4000 times larger than the canonical
value of $1\times10^{-17}$~s$^{-1}$ from the Galaxy cosmic rays, which is
consistent with our previous HC$_5$N observations. This provides an important
and independent confirmation of other studies that one or more sources inside
the OMC-2 FIR\,4 region emit energetic ($\geq10$~MeV) particles.

efficient and reliable transmission under disguised jamming, where the jammer
intentionally misleads the receiver by mimicking the characteristics of the
authorized signal, and causes complete communication failure. More
specifically, we bring off a dynamic constellation by introducing secure shared
randomness between the legitimate transmitter and receiver, and hence break the
symmetricity between the authorized signal and the disguised jamming. We
analyze the channel capacities of both the traditional OFDM and SP-OFDM under
hostile jamming using the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) model. It is shown
that the deterministic coding capacity of the traditional OFDM is zero under
the worst disguised jamming. On the other hand, due to the secure randomness
shared between the authorized transmitter and receiver, SP-OFDM can achieve a
positive capacity under disguised jamming since the AVC channel corresponding
to SP-OFDM is not symmetrizable. A remarkable feature of the proposed SP-OFDM
scheme is that while achieving strong jamming resistance, it has roughly the
same high spectral efficiency as the traditional OFDM system. The robustness of
the proposed SP-OFDM scheme under disguised jamming is demonstrated through
both theoretic and numerical analyses.

detach any layer without affecting others, and stretch shallow and wide LMs to

for better robustness. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

years has given rise to the best-known approximations for a variety of

various instantiations of a general conjecture: that it is hard to distinguish
a fully random combinatorial structure from one which contains a similar

$k^{-\alpha-o(1)}$, for any $k$ and $\alpha$. This holds even when the bound on

scaled so that transformed geodesics cross unit distance and have fluctuations
and scaled energy of unit order. Here we consider Poissonian last passage
percolation, a model lying in the KPZ universality class, and refer to scaled
geodesics as polymers and their scaled energies as weights. Polymers may be
viewed as random functions of the vertical coordinate and, when they are, we
show that they have modulus of continuity whose order is at most
$t^{2/3}\big(\log t^{-1}\big)^{1/3}$. The power of one-third in the logarithm
may be expected to be sharp and in a related problem we show that it is: among
polymers in the unit box whose endpoints have vertical separation $t$ (and a
horizontal separation of the same order), the maximum transversal fluctuation
has order $t^{2/3}\big(\log t^{-1}\big)^{1/3}$. Regarding the orthogonal
direction, in which growth occurs, we show that, when one endpoint of the
polymer is fixed at $(0,0)$ and the other is varied vertically over $(0,z)$,
$z\in [1,2]$, the resulting random weight profile has sharp modulus of
continuity of order $t^{1/3}\big(\log t^{-1}\big)^{2/3}$. In this way, we
identify exponent pairs of $(2/3,1/3)$ and $(1/3,2/3)$ in power law and

its minimum at zero and to reheat to various species of standard model and
supersymmetric matter. The perturbative decay rates to this matter are
computed, both analytically and numerically. Using these results, the Hubble
parameter and the relative energy densities for each matter species, including
that of the inflaton, are calculated numerically. The inflaton energy density
is demonstrated to vanish at an energy scale of ${\cal{O}}(10^{13})~{\rm GeV}$,
signaling the end of the period of reheating. The newly created matter
background is shown to be in thermal equilibrium, with a reheating temperature
of $\simeq 1.13 \times 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$. To allow for a $B-L$ breaking scale
sufficiently smaller than the reheating scale, we extend the statistical method

two-dimensional compressible elastic flows is studied. As in our earlier work
on the linear stability with constant coefficients, the problem has a free
boundary which is characteristic, and also the Kreiss-Lopatinskii condition is
not uniformly satisfied. In addition, the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant
of the para-linearized system may coincide with the poles of the system. Such a
new collapsing phenomenon causes serious difficulties when applying the
bicharacteristic extension method. Motivated by our method introduced in the
constant-coefficient case, we perform an upper triangularization to the
para-linearized system to separate the outgoing mode into a closed form where
the outgoing mode only appears at the leading order. This procedure results in
a gain of regularity for the outgoing mode which allows us to overcome the loss
of regularity of the characteristic components at the poles, and hence to close
all the energy estimates. We find that, analogous to the constant coefficient
case, elasticity generates notable stabilization effects, and there are
additional stable subsonic regions compared with the isentropic Euler flows.
Moreover, since our method does not rely on the construction of the
bicharacterisic curves, it can also be applied to other fluid models such as
the non-isentropic Euler equations and the MHD equations.

their mass and spin distributions. Once at design sensitivity, existing
instruments will be able to detect heavy binary black holes at redshifts of
$\sim 1$. Significant upgrades in the current facilities could increase the

which could observe most of the binary black holes merging anywhere in the

previous-generation detectors up and running once a significantly more
sensitive detector is online. First, we focus on a population of binary black
holes with redshifts distributed uniformly in comoving volume. We show that
measurement of extrinsic parameters, such as sky position, inclination and
luminosity distance can significantly benefit from the presence of a less
sensitive detector. Conversely, intrinsic parameters such as
\emph{detector-frame} masses and spins are largely unaffected. Measurement of
the \emph{source-frame masses} is instead improved, owing to the improvement of
the distance measurement. Then, we focus on nearby events. We simulated sources
similar to GW150914 and GW151226 and check how well their parameters can be

better estimation of the sky position, although even a single triangular-shaped

that reentrance is appreciable when the characteristic energy cost of the
homogeneous and modulated phases are comparable to each other, and for systems
in which the local order parameter is limited. In the asymptotic limit of high
energy cost of the homogeneous phase we obtain analytically that the degree of
reentrance of the phase diagram decreases exponentially with the ratio of the
characteristic energy cost of homogeneous and modulated phases. We are also
able to establish theoretical (upper and lower) bounds for the degree of the
reentrance, according to the nature of the competing interactions. Finally, we
confront our mean-field results with Langevin simulations of an effective
coarse grained model, confirming the main results regarding the degree of the
reentrance in the phase diagram. These results shed new light on the many
systems undergoing inverse melting transitions, from magnets to colloids and
vortex matter, by qualitatively improving the understanding of the interplay of
entropy and energy around the inverse melting points.

compute a sequence of tentative control inputs and store them in a buffer for
potential future use. State-dependent Random-time Drift (SRD) approach is often

However, using SRD, the analysis quickly becomes combinatoric and hence
difficult to extend to more sophisticated E-SAC. In this technical note, we
develop a general model and a new stability analysis for E-SAC based on Markov
jump systems. Using the new stability analysis, stochastic stability conditions
of existing E-SAC are also recovered. In addition, the proposed technique

of suspended monolayers of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown MoSe2.
Annealing with a green laser locally heats the suspended flake to approximately
600 K, which both removes contaminants and reduces strain gradients. At 4 K, we
observe linewidths as narrow as 3.5 meV (1.6nm) full-width at half-max (FWHM)
for both photoluminescence (PL) and reflection. Large peak reflectances up to
47% are also observed. These values are comparable to those of the highest
quality hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated samples. We demonstrate that
this laser annealing process can yield highly spatially homogeneous samples,
with the length scale of the homogeneity limited primarily by the size of the
suspended area. Annealed regions are very stable, exhibiting negligible
deterioration over 24 hours at cryogenic temperatures. The annealing method is
also very repeatable, with substantial improvements of sample quality on every

better performance than a single robust one. These systems unfold three major
phases: pool generation, selection and integration. One of the most promising
MCS approaches is Dynamic Selection (DS), which relies on finding the most
competent classifier or ensemble of classifiers to predict each test sample.
The majority of the DS techniques are based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
definition, and the quality of the neighborhood has a huge impact on the
performance of DS methods. In this paper, we perform an analysis comparing the
classification results of DS techniques and the K-NN classifier under different
conditions. Experiments are performed on 18 state-of-the-art DS techniques over
30 classification datasets and results show that DS methods present a
significant boost in classification accuracy even though they use the same
neighborhood as the K-NN. The reasons behind the outperformance of DS
techniques over the K-NN classifier reside in the fact that DS techniques can
deal with samples with a high degree of instance hardness (samples that are
located close to the decision border) as opposed to the K-NN. In this paper,
not only we explain why DS techniques achieve higher classification performance
than the K-NN but also when DS should be used.

characterization of complex systems when the cost of acquiring and processing
data is high. Leading sparse sensing methods typically exploit either spatial
or temporal correlations, but rarely both. This work introduces a new sparse
sensor optimization that is designed to leverage the rich spatiotemporal
coherence exhibited by many systems. Our approach is inspired by the remarkable
performance of flying insects, which use a few embedded strain-sensitive
neurons to achieve rapid and robust flight control despite large gust
disturbances. Specifically, we draw on nature to identify targeted
neural-inspired sensors on a flapping wing to detect body rotation. This task
is particularly challenging as the rotational twisting mode is three
orders-of-magnitude smaller than the flapping modes. We show that nonlinear
filtering in time, built to mimic strain-sensitive neurons, is essential to
detect rotation, whereas instantaneous measurements fail. Optimized sparse
sensor placement results in efficient classification with approximately ten
sensors, achieving the same accuracy and noise robustness as full measurements
consisting of hundreds of sensors. Sparse sensing with neural inspired encoding
establishes a new paradigm in hyper-efficient, embodied sensing of
spatiotemporal data and sheds light on principles of biological sensing for
agile flight control.

the chemical ordering of FePt-BaFexOy-C media are similar to that of FePt-C
meida. By tuning the volume fraction of BaFexOy and C, well-separated FePt
grains (average grain size = 6.8 nm) surrounded by BaFexOy shell with
perpendicular Hc above 35 kOe can be obtained. Transmission electron microscopy
study with chemical analysis shows that the magnetic oxide appears to be
crystalline and surround the FePt grains with immediate full enclosure.
Magnetic measurements indicate an effective increase of magnetic grain size at

collection of distributions of $M_P(X)$, indexed by distributions of $X$, is
shown to encode Kingman's partition structure derived from $P$. For instance,
if $X_p$ has Bernoulli$(p)$ distribution on $\{0,1\}$, the $n$th moment of
$M_P(X_p)$ is a polynomial function of $p$ which equals the probability
generating function of the number $K_n$ of distinct values in a sample of size
$n$ from $P$: $E (M_P(X_p))^n = E p^{K_n}$. This elementary identity
illustrates a general moment formula for $P$-means in terms of the partition
structure associated with random samples from $P$, first developed by Diaconis

temperature (TC = 305 K) but its magnetization undergoes an abrupt decrease at

effects around TC and TS, respectively, were reported earlier in this single
phase compound [D. V. M. Repaka et al., J. Appl. Phys. 112, 123915 (2012)]. The
thermal expansion shows an abrupt decrease at TS in zero magnetic field but it
transforms into an abrupt increase at the same temperature under 7 T, which we
interpret as the consequence of magnetic field-induced structural transition
from a low-volume monoclinic (I2/a symmetry) to a high volume orthorhombic
(Pnma symmetry) phase in corroboration with a published neutron diffraction
study in zero magnetic field. While the external magnetic field does not change
TS, application of a hydrostatic pressure of P = 1.16 GPa shifts the magnetic
anomaly at TS towards high temperature. The pressure induced shift of the
low-temperature anomaly (deltaTS = 27 K) is nine-times more than that of the
ferromagnetic Curie temperature (deltaTC = 3K). Our results suggest that while
hydrostatic pressure stabilizes the low temperature monoclinic phase at the
expense of orthorhombic phase, magnetic field has an opposite effect.

geometry as the optimal generative network of quantum states. We speculate that
the space geometry stems as a geodesic tensor network which defines the quantum
state complexity of a fundamental quantum state under a given metric. Spacetime
corresponds to an evolving tensor network that generates an evolutional
fundamental quantum system. This mechanism provides (a) a constructive
correspondence between quantum states and spacetime geometry; (b)a spacetime
structure emerging from a highly constrained geodesic so that the QEC-like
structure shown in AdS/CFT can be naturally realized and (c) a mechanism to
derive the gravity equation from the concept of quantum state complexity. With
this mechanism, spacetime can have a quantum mechanical description. We hope
this may lead to another view direction to understand the basic rules of our

We simulate outbursts due to this thermal-viscous instability for two symbiotic

simulations suggest that, although the recurrent nova events observed in RS~Oph
are due to a thermonuclear runaway at the white dwarf surface, these runaways
are triggered by accretion disc instabilities. In quiescence, the disc builds
up its mass and it is only during the disc-instability outburst that mass is
accreted on to the white dwarf at rates comparable to or larger than the
mass-transfer rate. For a mass-transfer rate in the range $10^{-8}$ to
$10^{-7}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, the accretion rate and the mass accreted
are sufficient to lead to a thermonuclear runaway during one of a series of a
few dwarf nova outbursts, barely visible in the optical, but easily detectable
in X-rays. In the case of Z~And, persistent irradiation of the disc by the very
hot white-dwarf surface strongly modifies the dwarf-nova outburst properties,
making them significant only for very high mass-transfer rates, of the order of
$10^{-6}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, much higher than the expected secular mean
in this system. It is thus likely that the so-called `combination nova'
outburst observed in years 2000 to 2002 was triggered not by a dwarf-nova
instability but by a mass-transfer enhancement from the giant companion,
leading to an increase in nuclear burning at the accreting white-dwarf surface.

multiplet of fields matching the content of the bosonic sector of the
electroweak particle model, however with the following significant difference -
the SU(2)xU(1) iso-doublet Higgs-like scalar enters here with a standard
positive mass squared and without quartic selfinteraction. Strong interaction
dynamics and, in particular, QCD-like confinement effects are also considered
by introducing an additional coupling to a strongly nonlinear gauge field whose
Lagrangian contains a square-root of the standard Maxwell/Yang-Mills kinetic
term. The latter is known to produce charge confinement in flat spacetime. The
principal new ingredient in the present approach is employing the formalism of
non-Riemannian spacetime volume-forms - alternative generally covariant volume
elements independent of the spacetime metric, constructed in terms of auxiliary
antisymmetric tensor gauge fields of maximal rank. Although being almost
pure-gauge, i.e. not introducing any additional propagating degrees of freedom,
their dynamics triggers a series of physically important features when passing
to the Einstein frame: (i) Appearance of two infinitely large flat regions of
the effective ""inflaton"" scalar potential with vastly different energy scales
corresponding to the ""early"" and ""late"" epochs of the Universe; (ii) Dynamical
generation of Higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breaking effective potential for
the SU(2)xU(1) iso-doublet scalar in the ""late"" Universe, and vanishing of the
symmetry breaking in the ""early"" Universe; (iii) Dynamical appearance of charge
confinement via the ""square-root"" nonlinear gauge field in the ""late"" Universe

the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize answers from
the other version. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and
answers are created from different versions of a document narrating the same
underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap
between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the
answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different
levels of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions

over events across multiple sentences. Indeed, we observe that state-of-the-art
neural RC models which have achieved near human performance on the SQuAD

magnetic field. We use a heated $^{85}$Rb vapor cell between a pair of
position-adjustable permanent magnets capable of applying magnetic fields up to
1 T. To demonstrate the frequency reference we use a spectral feature from the
Zeeman shifted D1 line in $^{85}$Rb at 795 nm to stabilize a laser to the
7S$_{1/2}$ $\longrightarrow$ 23P$_{1/2}$ transition in atomic cesium, which is
detuned by approximately 19 GHz from the unperturbed Rb transition. We place an
upper bound on the stability of the technique by measuring a 2.5 MHz RMS
frequency difference between the two spectral features over a 24 hour period.
This versatile method could be adapted easily for use with other atomic species

conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while
utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions.
This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme
data sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this

coefficient $\rho$ is an accurate measure of linear dependence. We show that
$\rho$ is a normalized, Euclidean type distance between joint probability
distribution of the two random variables and that when their independence is

constant is the geometric mean of two maximal distances, each between the joint
probability distribution when the full linear dependence is assumed while
preserving respective marginal distribution and that when the independence is
assumed. Usage of it is restricted to linear dependence because it is based on
Euclidean type distances that are generally not metrics and considered full
dependence is linear. Therefore, we argue that if a suitable distance metric is
used while considering all possible maximal dependences then it can measure any
non-linear dependence. But then, one must define all the full dependences.
Hellinger distance that is a metric can be used as the distance measure between

analysis of the light curves for transiting exoplanet and eclipsing binary star
systems, particularly for high-precision light curves at optical wavelengths.
The power-2 limb-darkening law, $I_\lambda(\mu) = 1 -
c\left(1-\mu^{\alpha}\right)$, has recently been proposed as a good compromise
between complexity and precision in the treatment of limb-darkening. I have
used synthetic spectra based on the 3D stellar atmosphere models from the
Stagger-grid to compute the limb-darkening for several passbands (UBVRI,
CHEOPS, TESS, Kepler, etc.). The parameters of the power-2 limb-darkening laws
are optimized using a least-squares fit to a simulated light curve computed
directly from the tabulated $I_\lambda(\mu)$ values. I use the transformed
parameters $h_1 = 1-c\left(1-2^{-\alpha}\right)$ and $h_2 = c2^{-\alpha}$ to
directly compare these optimized limb-darkening parameters to the limb
darkening measured from Kepler light curves of 16 transiting exoplanet systems.
The posterior probability distributions (PPDs) of the transformed parameters
$h_1$ and $h_2$ resulting from the light curve analysis are found to be much
less strongly correlated than the PPDs for $c$ and $\alpha$. The agreement
between the computed and observed values of ($h_1$, $h_2$) is generally very
good but there are significant differences between the observed and computed
values for Kepler-17, the only star in the sample that shows significant
variability between the eclipses due to magnetic activity (star spots). The
tabulation of $h_1$ and $h_2$ provided here can be used to accurately model the
light curves of transiting exoplanets. I also provide estimates of the priors

representing rich correlation structures among topics by a directed acyclic
graph over topics. Because of the flexibility of the model, however,
approximate inference is very difficult. Perhaps for this reason, only a small
number of potential PAM architectures have been explored in the literature. In
this paper we present an efficient and flexible amortized variational inference
method for PAM, using a deep inference network to parameterize the approximate
posterior distribution in a manner similar to the variational autoencoder. Our
inference method produces more coherent topics than state-of-art inference
methods for PAM while being an order of magnitude faster, which allows
exploration of a wider range of PAM architectures than have previously been
studied.

characterize and quantify the effect of ionospheric-induced systematic errors

the number of required calibration parameters, and therefore enables new

violate fundamental assumptions of traditional recommendation systems. This
paper focuses on reviewing and categorizing the current progress on expert

(DL-based models) and ranking based models (R-based models). We find that
MF-based models outperform other categories of models in the field of expert

important concepts of ensemble learning, and find that ensemble models with
several specific single models can further boosting the performance. Further,
we compare the performance of different models on different types of matching

  0004-3702","10.1016/j.artint.2019.07.006",,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An increasingly wide range of artificial intelligence applications rely on
syntactic information to process and extract meaning from natural language text
or speech, with constituent trees being one of the most widely used syntactic
formalisms. To produce these phrase-structure representations from sentences in
natural language, shift-reduce constituent parsers have become one of the most
efficient approaches. Increasing their accuracy and speed is still one of the
main objectives pursued by the research community so that artificial
intelligence applications that make use of parsing outputs, such as machine
translation or voice assistant services, can improve their performance. With
this goal in mind, we propose in this article a novel non-binary shift-reduce
algorithm for constituent parsing. Our parser follows a classical bottom-up
strategy but, unlike others, it straightforwardly creates non-binary branchings
with just one Reduce transition, instead of requiring prior binarization or a
sequence of binary transitions, allowing its direct application to any language
without the need of further resources such as percolation tables. As a result,
it uses fewer transitions per sentence than existing transition-based
constituent parsers, becoming the fastest such system and, as a consequence,
speeding up downstream applications. Using static oracle training and greedy
search, the accuracy of this novel approach is on par with state-of-the-art
transition-based constituent parsers and outperforms all top-down and bottom-up
greedy shift-reduce systems on the Wall Street Journal section from the English
Penn Treebank and the Penn Chinese Treebank. Additionally, we develop a dynamic
oracle for training the proposed transition-based algorithm, achieving further
improvements in both benchmarks and obtaining the best accuracy to date on the
Penn Chinese Treebank among greedy shift-reduce parsers.

and infinitesimally thin discs, to observational data along the major axis for
7 spiral galaxies of early types. Unlike most papers, the dispersion equation
corresponding to the criterion was solved directly without using any
approximation. The velocity dispersion of stars in the radial direction
$\sigma_R$ was limited by the range of possible values instead of a fixed
value. For all galaxies, the outer regions of the disc were analyzed up to $R <
130^{""}$. The maximal and sub-maximal disc models were used to translate
surface brightness into surface density. The largest destabilizing disturbance
stars can exert on a gaseous disc was estimated. It was shown that the
two-component criterion differs a little from the one-fluid criterion for
galaxies with a large surface gas density, but it allows to explain large-scale
star formation in those regions where the gaseous disc is stable. In the galaxy
NGC 1167 star formation is entirely driven by the self-gravity of the stars. A
comparison is made with the conventional approximations which also include the
thickness effect and with models for different sound speed $c_\mathrm{g}$. It
is shown that values of the effective Toomre parameter correspond to the
instability criterion of a two-component disc $Q_\mathrm{eff}<1.5-2.5$. This
result is consistent with previous theoretical and observational studies.

$Q_\mathrm{eff}<3$ were compared with the ongoing star formation regions

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of spin-1 bosons. We demonstrate the spin
superfluid ground state in canted antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 thin film at low
temperatures via nonlocal spin transport. A large enhancement of the nonlocal

We show that the spins can propagate over very long distances (~ 20 micro
meters) in such spin superfluid ground state and the nonlocal spin signal
decreases very slowly as the spacing increases with an inverse relationship,
which is consistent with theoretical prediction. Furthermore, spin
superfluidity has been investigated in the canted antiferromagnetic phase of
the (11-20)-oriented Cr2O3 film, where the magnetic field dependence of the
associated critical temperature follows a two-thirds power law near the
critical point. The experimental demonstration of the spin superfluid ground

employing transport coefficients derived by Salo et al. We assume optical
depths of 1.5-2 to model Saturn's dense rings. Furthermore, local N-body
simulations, incorporating vertical and radial collective self-gravity are
performed. Vertical self-gravity is mimicked through an increased frequency of
vertical oscillations, while radial self-gravity is approximated by solving the
Poisson equation for an axisymmetric thin disk with a Fourier method. Direct
particle-particle forces are omitted, which prevents small-scale gravitational
instabilities (self-gravity wakes) from forming, an approximation that allows
us to study long radial scales and to compare directly the hydrodynamic model
and the N-body simulations. Our isothermal and non-isothermal hydrodynamic
model results with vanishing self-gravity compare very well with results of
Latter & Ogilvie and Rein & Latter, respectively. In contrast, for rings with
radial self-gravity we find that the wavelengths of saturated overstable waves
settle close to the frequency minimum of the nonlinear dispersion relation,
i.e. close to a state of vanishing group velocities of the waves. Good
agreement is found between non-isothermal hydrodynamics and N-body simulations

for weak self-gravity. The resulting saturation wavelengths of viscous
overstability for moderate and strong self-gravity (100-300m) agree reasonably

high mobility user (called a target user) without changing the periodicity of
the conventional beam training. The dedicated beam training requires small
amount of resources since the training beams can be optimized for the target
user. In order to satisfy the performance requirement with low training
overhead, we propose the optimal training beam selection strategy which finds
the best beamforming vectors yielding the lowest channel estimation error based
on the target user's probabilistic channel information. Such dedicated beam
training is combined with the greedy channel estimation algorithm that accounts
for sparse characteristics and temporal dynamics of the target user's channel.
Our numerical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can maintain
good channel estimation performance with significantly less training overhead
compared to the conventional beam training protocols.

implicit R-K methods for physical problems, we interpret to derive a class of

thus obtained by cutting down amplification error and maximum reduction of
weighted phase error, suggest better accuracy for relatively bigger CFL number.
Significantly, we are able to outline an algorithm that can be used to design
stable implicit R-K methods for suitable time step with better accuracy

The refinement can be alternatively defined as those Nash equilibria that do

obtained by coarse-graining a vast number of microstates into a low-dimensional
mesh of mesostates. If the landscape contains two or more local minima
(macrostates),one can compute global rate constants provided the dynamics of
the dividing barrier regions are known. Here we compared experimental rate
constants between ordered states in a kinetic Ising model with rates calculated
from a coarse-grained master equation derived from the microcanonical ensemble.
The coarse-grained macroscopic rate constants were roughly 50 % larger than
experiment across a range of environmental constraints, suggesting a systematic
impediment of configurational progress on the microscopic scale that is
specific to the structure of the Ising model. The error in coarse-graining lay
with the calculation of the diffusion coefficient rather than with the shape of
the free energy landscape, as ensemble- and time-averaged estimates of the
latter were indistinguishable. Fluctuation analysis in the form of Nyquist
theorem also failed to substantially improve the value of the effective
diffusion coefficient, suggesting a failure of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. These findings from the Ising model raises doubts over the validity of
the free energy landscape approach in calculating absolute transition rates for
more complex systems such as proteins.

rooted in the high-dimensionality of the stochastic input and the frequent lack
of explicit knowledge of its probability distribution. Traditional approaches
show limitations for such problems. To address these difficulties, we have
developed a general framework of constructing surrogate models on spaces of
stochastic input with arbitrary probability measure irrespective of the mutual
dependencies between individual components and the analytical form. The present
Data-driven Sparsity-enhancing Rotation for Arbitrary Randomness (DSRAR)
framework includes a data-driven construction of multivariate polynomial basis
for arbitrary mutually dependent probability measure and a sparsity enhancement
rotation procedure. This sparsity-enhancing rotation method was initially
proposed in our previous work [1] for Gaussian distributions, which may not be
feasible for non-Gaussian distributions due to the loss of orthogonality after
the rotation. To remedy such difficulties, we developed the new approach to
construct orthonormal polynomials for arbitrary mutually dependent (amdP)
randomness, ensuring the constructed basis maintains the orthogonality with
respect to the density of the rotated random vector, where directly applying
the regular polynomial chaos including arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) [2]
shows limitations due to the assumption of the mutual independence between the
components of the random inputs. The developed DSRAR framework leads to
accurate recovery of a sparse representation of the target functions. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in challenging problems such as
PDEs and realistic molecular systems where the underlying density is implicitly
represented by a large collection of sample data, as well as systems with
explicitly given non-Gaussian probabilistic measures.

ultra-broad operating band, good wide-angle characteristic and thermal
stability make the absorber promising in the application of antenna
measurement, steady technology and energy harvesting.
