assumption that the main heating source, stellar irradiation, does not vary
much with time. However, it is known that accreting young stars are variable
sources of radiation. This is particularly evident for outbursting sources such
as EX Lupi and FU Orionis stars. Aim: We investigate how such outbursts affect
the vertical structure of the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk, in
particular their appearance in scattered light at optical and near-infrared
wavelengths. Methods: We employ the 3D FARGOCA radiation-hydrodynamics code, in
polar coordinates, to compute the time-dependent behavior of the axisymmetric
disk structure. The outbursting inner disk region is not included explicitly.
Instead, its luminosity is added to the stellar luminosity and is thus included
in the irradiation of the outer disk regions. For time snapshots of interest we
insert the density structure into the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code and
compute the appearance of the disk at optical/near-infrared wavelengths.
Results: We find that, depending on the amplitude of the outbursts, the
vertical structure of the disk can become highly dynamic, featuring circular
surface waves of considerable amplitude. These ""hills"" and ""valleys"" on the
disk's surface show up in the scattered light images as bright and dark
concentric rings. Initially these rings are small and act as standing waves,
but they subsequently lead to outward propagating waves, like the waves
produced by a stone thrown into a pond. These waves continue long after the
actual outburst has died out. Conclusions: We propose that some of the
multi-ringed structures seen in optical/infrared images of several
protoplanetary disks may have their origin in outbursts that occurred decades
or centuries ago.

Due to the implementation simplicity, data parallelism is currently the most
commonly used parallelization method. Nonetheless, data parallelism suffers
from excessive inter-GPU communication overhead due to frequent weight
synchronization among GPUs. Another approach is pipelined model parallelism,
which partitions a DNN model among GPUs, and processes multiple mini-batches
concurrently. This approach can significantly reduce inter-GPU communication
cost compared to data parallelism. However, pipelined model parallelism faces
the weight staleness issue; that is, gradients are computed with stale weights,
leading to training instability and accuracy loss. In this paper, we present a
pipelined model parallel execution method that enables high GPU utilization

pulsating simultaneously in the fundamental and first overtone modes are
reported. Two double-mode pulsators are not isolated cases however, but form an
extension of recently identified class of long-period RRd stars. Period
doubling effect was detected in three BL Her-type stars: two were identified
previously and one is a new discovery. Through identification of numerous
period-doubled W Vir stars we show that the appearance of the period doubling
effect, and hence the transition towards RV Tau class, is a smooth process that
starts at pulsation periods slightly above 15d. Interchange of the deep and
shallow pulsation cycles is identified in tens of RV Tau variables. One RV Tau
star is a strong candidate for period-4 pulsation. Quasi-periodic modulation of
pulsation in all sub-classes of type II Cepheids is reported for the first
time. Modulation was detected in 16 BL Her, 9 W Vir and in 7 RV Tau stars. In
the last case, modulation is the most likely scenario, but two other scenarios,
excitation of non-radial modes, or period-4 pulsation, can also account for the
observed pulsation pattern. Irregular changes of pulsation amplitude and period
on various time-scales are common in all subgroups of type II Cepheids.

work is size lower bounds of refutations in Resolution for families of
contradictions in the usual unary encoding. Our main interest is the $k$-Clique
Principle, whose Resolution complexity is still unknown.
  Our main result is a $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound for the size of refutations
of the binary $k$-Clique Principle in $Res(\lfloor \frac{1}{2}\log \log
n\rfloor)$. This improves the result of Lauria, Pudl\'ak et al. [24] who proved
the lower bound for Resolution, that is $Res(1)$.
  Our second lower bound proves that in $RES(s)$ for $s\leq
\log^{\frac{1}{2-\epsilon}}(n)$, the shortest proofs of the $BinPHP^m_n$,
requires size $2^{n^{1-\delta}}$, for any $\delta>0$. Furthermore we prove that
$BinPHP^m_n$ can be refuted in size $2^{\Theta(n)}$ in treelike $Res(1)$,
contrasting with the unary case, where $PHP^m_n$ requires treelike $RES(1)$ \
refutations of size $2^{\Omega(n \log n)}$ [9,16].
  Furthermore we study under what conditions the complexity of refutations in
Resolution will not increase significantly (more than a polynomial factor) when
shifting between the unary encoding and the binary encoding. We show that this
is true, from unary to binary, for propositional encodings of principles
expressible as a $\Pi_2$-formula and involving {\em total variable
comparisons}. We then show that this is true, from binary to unary, when one
considers the \emph{functional unary encoding}. Finally we prove that the
binary encoding of the general Ordering principle $OP$ -- with no total
ordering constraints -- is polynomially provable in Resolution.

Additionally, accounting for stimulus-driven visual inputs explains the

the alternating minimization of two energy functions that are linked through
the use of dynamic priors. We rely on the integration of shape and appearance

To this point, we extend Pearson's notions of skewness and kurtosis to build a
powerful family of goodness-of-fit tests based on Rao's score for the
exponential power distribution $\mathrm{EPD}_{\lambda}(\mu,\sigma)$, including
tests for normality and Laplacity when $\lambda$ is set to 1 or 2. We find the
asymptotic distribution of our test statistic, which is the sum of the squares
of two $Z$-scores, under the null and under local alternatives. We also develop
an innovative regression strategy to obtain $Z$-scores that are nearly
independent and distributed as standard Gaussians, resulting in a $\chi_2^2$
distribution valid for any sample size (up to very high precision for $n\geq
20$). The case $\lambda=1$ leads to a powerful test of fit for the
Laplace($\mu,\sigma$) distribution, whose empirical power is superior to all

PRTSA methods suffer from excessive training time and complex tuning of
parameters, resulting in inefficiency for real-time implementation and lacking
the online model updating ability. In this paper, a novel PRTSA approach based
on an ensemble of OS-extreme learning machine (EOSELM) with binary Jaya
(BinJaya)-based feature selection is proposed with the use of phasor

OS-ELM, an EOS-ELM-based PRTSA model is built to predict the post-fault

and an online boosting algorithm, respectively, as a weak classifier and an
ensemble learning algorithm. Furthermore, a BinJaya-based feature selection
approach is put forward for selecting an optimal feature subset from the entire

extracted from PMU data. The application results on the IEEE 39-bus system and
a real provincial system show that the proposal has superior computation speed
and prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art sequential learning
algorithms. In addition, without sacrificing the classification performance,
the dimension of the input space has been reduced to about one-third of its

information loss. To address this problem, we propose a new graph-based
structurally interacting elastic net method for feature selection.
Specifically, we commence by constructing feature graphs that can incorporate
pairwise relationship between samples. With the feature graphs to hand, we
propose a new information theoretic criterion to measure the joint relevance of
different pairwise feature combinations with respect to the target feature
graph representation. This measure is used to obtain a structural interaction
matrix where the elements represent the proposed information theoretic measure
between feature pairs. We then formulate a new optimization model through the
combination of the structural interaction matrix and an elastic net regression
model for the feature subset selection problem. This allows us to a) preserve
the information of the original vectorial space, b) remedy the information loss
of the original feature space caused by using graph representation, and c)
promote a sparse solution and also encourage correlated features to be
selected. Because the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we develop
an efficient alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to locate the
optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

can guide a learning algorithm to a target model with minimal effort. In
conventional settings, a teacher provides data that are consistent with the
true data distribution. However, for sequential learners which actively choose
their queries, such as multi-armed bandits and active learners, the teacher can
only provide responses to the learner's queries, not design the full data. In
this setting, consistent teachers can be sub-optimal for finite horizons. We
formulate this sequential teaching problem, which current techniques in machine
teaching do not address, as a Markov decision process, with the dynamics
nesting a model of the learner and the actions being the teacher's responses.
Furthermore, we address the complementary problem of learning from a teacher
that plans: to recognise the teaching intent of the responses, the learner is
endowed with a model of the teacher. We test the formulation with multi-armed
bandit learners in simulated experiments and a user study. The results show
that learning is improved by (i) planning teaching and (ii) the learner having

this work, we propose a novel method for brain surface morphometry analysis
based on surface foliation theory. Given brain cortical surfaces with
automatically extracted landmark curves, we first construct finite foliations
on surfaces. A set of admissible curves and a height parameter for each loop
are provided by users. The admissible curves cut the surface into a set of
pairs of pants. A pants decomposition graph is then constructed. Strebel
differential is obtained by computing a unique harmonic map from surface to
pants decomposition graph. The critical trajectories of Strebel differential
decompose the surface into topological cylinders. After conformally mapping
those topological cylinders to standard cylinders, parameters of standard
cylinders (height, circumference) are intrinsic geometric features of the
original cortical surfaces and thus can be used for morphometry analysis
purpose. In this work, we propose a set of novel surface features rooted in
surface foliation theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
to make use of surface foliation theory for brain morphometry analysis. The
features we computed are intrinsic and informative. The proposed method is
rigorous, geometric, and automatic. Experimental results on classifying brain
cortical surfaces between patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy control
subjects demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method.

human-level accuracy. But in contrast to the recent advances in face
recognition techniques, Disguised Facial Identification continues to be a
tougher challenge in the field of computer vision. The modern day scenario,
where security is of prime concern, regular face identification techniques do
not perform as required when the faces are disguised, which calls for a
different approach to handle situations where intruders have their faces
masked. Along the same lines, we propose a deep learning architecture for
disguised facial recognition (DFR). The algorithm put forward in this paper
detects 20 facial key-points in the first stage, using a 14-layered

by a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying the disguised faces based on
the euclidean distance ratios and angles between different facial key-points.
This overall architecture imparts a basic intelligence to our system. Our
key-point feature prediction accuracy is 65% while the classification rate is
72.4%. Moreover, the architecture works at 19 FPS, thereby performing in almost

with O3 at the 1,2 position to produce methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), formaldehyde,

approximately 10 seconds under dilute (1.5-4% in argon) continuous flow
conditions in an alumina tube held at 298 K and 5 Torr. Products exiting the
tube were rapidly slowed and cooled within the buffer gas cell by collisions
with cryogenic (4-7 K) He. High resolution chirped pulse microwave detection
between 12 and 26 GHz was used to achieve highly sensitive (ppb scale),
isomer-specific product quantification. We observed a ratio of MACR to MVK of
2.1 +/- 0.4 under 1:1 ozone to isoprene conditions and 2.1 +/- 0.2 under 2:1

to linking together phase detections on different sensors that originate from a

around the world. This task can be challenging because the number of sources is
unknown, events frequently overlap in time, or can occur simultaneously in
different parts of a network. We present PhaseLink, a framework based on recent
advances in deep learning for grid-free earthquake phase association. Our
approach learns to link phases together that share a common origin, and is

a set of ad hoc hyperparameters to improve performance, PhaseLink can be
improved by simply adding examples of problematic cases to the training
dataset. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PhaseLink on a
challenging recent sequence from southern California, and synthesized sequences
from Japan designed to test the point at which the method fails. For the
examined datasets, PhaseLink can precisely associate P- and S-picks to events

was shown recently by Suwanmajo and Krishnan. Our results, which significantly
extend their analyses, are as follows. First, in the three-dimensional space of
total amounts, the border between systems with a stable versus unstable steady
state is a surface defined by the vanishing of a single Hurwitz determinant.
Second, this surface consists generically of simple Hopf bifurcations. Next,
simulations suggest that when the steady state is unstable, oscillations are
the norm. Finally, the emergence of oscillations via a Hopf bifurcation is
enabled by the catalytic and association constants of the distributive part of
the mechanism: if these rate constants satisfy two inequalities, then the
system generically admits a Hopf bifurcation. Our proofs are enabled by the
Routh-Hurwitz criterion, a Hopf-bifurcation criterion due to Yang, and a
monomial parametrization of steady states.

  Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel beamforming strategy for
directional frame timing synchronization in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave)
systems operating with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In
the employed system model, we assume multiple radio frequency chains equipped
at the base station to simultaneously form multiple synchronization beams in
the analog domain. We formulate the corresponding directional frame timing
synchronization problem as a max-min multicast beamforming problem under
low-resolution quantization. We first show that the formulated problem cannot
be effectively solved by conventional single-stream beamforming based
approaches due to large quantization loss and limited beam codebook resolution.
We then develop a new multi-beam probing based directional synchronization
strategy, targeting at maximizing the minimum received synchronization
signal-to-quantization-plus-noise ratio (SQNR) among all users. Leveraging a
common synchronization signal structure design, the proposed approach
synthesizes an effective composite beam from the simultaneously probed beams to
better trade off the beamforming gain and the quantization distortion.
Numerical results reveal that for wideband mmWave systems with low-resolution
ADCs, the timing synchronization performance of our proposed method outperforms
the existing approaches due to the improvement in the received synchronization
SQNR.

analyzed. However, the performance of these protocols highly depends on how the
tasks are partitioned and prioritized and how the resources are shared locally
and globally. This paper answers a few fundamental questions when real-time
tasks share resources in multiprocessor systems. We explore the fundamental
difficulty of the multiprocessor synchronization problem and show that a very
simplified version of this problem is ${\mathcal NP}$-hard in the strong sense
regardless of the number of processors and the underlying scheduling paradigm.
Therefore, the allowance of preemption or migration does not reduce the
computational complexity. For the positive side, we develop a dependency-graph
approach, that is specifically useful for frame-based real-time tasks, in which
all tasks have the same period and release their jobs always at the same time.
We present a series of algorithms with speedup factors between $2$ and $3$
under semi-partitioned scheduling. We further explore methodologies and
tradeoffs of preemptive against non-preemptive scheduling algorithms and
partitioned against semi-partitioned scheduling algorithms. The approach is
extended to periodic tasks under certain conditions.

cope with the users' ever-increasing desire for higher data rates, a
high-throughput free-space optics (FSO) link is employed as the
relay-destination backhaul link. Dynamic-order decoding is employed at the

slowing down but accelerating again at even larger times, consistent with the
slow dynamics being a crossover phenomena with a localized critical point.

generally noticeable changes in their magnitudes, unless $\sigma_{n\ell}$
concentrates a relatively large part of oscillator strength of the continuum

static polarizability of C$_{60}$, $\alpha > 800$ $a.u.$. Furthermore, it is
demonstrated that the DSP effect results in the transmission of a part of

reasons behind the made findings are provided. Photoionization of Xe@C$_{60}$,
Ne@C$_{60}$, H@C$_{60}$ and some hypothetical C$^{-}_{60}$ fullerene anions is
chosen as a case study. For Xe@C$_{60}$, the role of atomic-core relaxation of
the ionized encapsuled Xe$^{+}$-ion-remainder on the $\rm 4d$ photoionization

correlation function and the associated primordial power spectrum of mean
square vacuum fluctuation in a bipartite quantum field theoretic system. The
field theory that we consider is the effective theory of axion field arising
from Type IIB string theory compactified to four dimensions. We compute the
expression for the power spectrum of vacuum fluctuation in three different
approaches, namely (1) field operator expansion (FOE) technique with the
quantum entangled state, (2) reduced density matrix (RDM) formalism with mixed
quantum state and (3) the method of non-entangled state (NES). For massless
axion field, in all these three formalism, we reproduce, at the leading order,
the exact scale-invariant power spectrum which is well known in the literature.
We observe that due to quantum entanglement, the sub-leading terms for these
thee formalisms are different. Thus, such correction terms break the degeneracy
among the analysis of the FOE, RDM and NES formalisms in the super-horizon
limit. On the other hand, for massive axion field, we get a slight deviation
from scale invariance and exactly quantify the spectral tilt of the power
spectrum in small scales. Apart from that, for massless and massive axion
field, we find distinguishable features of the power spectrum for the FOE, RDM,
and NES on the large scales, which is the result of quantum entanglement. We
also find that such large-scale effects are comparable to or greater than the
curvature radius of the de Sitter space. Most importantly, in the near future,
if experiments probe for early universe phenomena, one can detect such small
quantum effects. In such a scenario, it is possible to test the implications of
quantum entanglement in primordial cosmology.

science objectives of NEAR was the MAG experiment, which measured the magnetic
field in the vicinity of Eros during orbit and after landing. Eros is therefore
at the present the best characterized asteroid using in situ measurement of
magnetism. MAG results suggested that Eros was very unmagnetized-with an upper
bound on the natural remanent magnetism (NRM) placed at $1.9\times
10^{-6}\mathrm{A\cdot m^2 \cdot kg^{-1}}$-especially when compared to meteorite
samples of analogous composition. Since meteorites and asteroids are typically
believed to represent the remnants of disrupted parent bodies, the
ramifications of the low level of magnetization of Eros are considerable, since
it could imply disparate origins for objects of similar composition. In this
paper, we explore whether there are any systematic effects related to the
actual process of measurement and derivation of the Erotian NRM, and whether
such effects played a role in the low levels of NRM derived for Eros. By
simulating the orbit of NEAR around Eros and using the field strength values
measured by NEAR, we find that we are able to place a higher bound on the NRM
of Eros by a factor of at least an order of magnitude higher than that
originally suggested by Acu\~{n}a, et al. (2002). We find that if we suppose
Eros to be made up of constituents that have roughly uniform magnetization
directionally, that it is possible to infer an L or LL chondrite-type
composition for Eros within the bounds of values for remanent magnetism
reported in the meteorite record. The results provide a more rigorous
confirmation of the suggestion by Wasilewski, et al. (2002) that Eros cannot be

thus has been blocked by some MNOs in practice. We propose a hybrid pricing
framework for MNOs who charge users separately for access and tethering. This
scheme serves to coordinate the tethering decisions of mobile users with MNO
network management objectives. We analyze the MNOs' equilibrium pricing
strategies in both cooperative and competitive scenarios. In the cooperative
scenario, at the equilibrium, each user's cost is independent of any chosen
tethering links. We then characterize the optimal hybrid pricing strategies of
MNOs in this scenario. For the competitive scenario, we formulate the MNOs'
competitive interactions as a pricing game, and we show that MNO competition
leads to equalized prices for users if an equilibrium exists but does not
guarantee its existence. Both insights motivate a quantity competition game,
which is shown to guarantee an equilibrium. Simulation results show that in

vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even in a black-box scenario. However, most
of the existing black-box attack algorithms need to make a huge amount of
queries to perform attacks, which is not practical in the real world. We note
one of the main reasons for the massive queries is that the adversarial example
is required to be visually similar to the original image, but in many cases,
how adversarial examples look like does not matter much. It inspires us to
introduce a new attack called \emph{input-free} attack, under which an
adversary can choose an arbitrary image to start with and is allowed to add
perceptible perturbations on it. Following this approach, we propose two
techniques to significantly reduce the query complexity. First, we initialize
an adversarial example with a gray color image on which every pixel has roughly
the same importance for the target model. Then we shrink the dimension of the
attack space by perturbing a small region and tiling it to cover the input
image. To make our algorithm more effective, we stabilize a projected gradient
ascent algorithm with momentum, and also propose a heuristic approach for
region size selection. Through extensive experiments, we show that with only
1,701 queries on average, we can perturb a gray image to any target class of
ImageNet with a 100\% success rate on InceptionV3. Besides, our algorithm has
successfully defeated two real-world systems, the Clarifai food detection API

many-second-long phase diffusion with a low-cost local oscillator that
otherwise seems unrealistic to obtain with such an oscillator. In the Ramsey
experiment we record interference fringes with contrast decaying in $12$ s, and
with a frequency uncertainty of $80$ mHz corresponding to the dephasing time of
$2.8$ s. A clear distinction is drawn between the decoherence of the atomic
ensemble, and the dephasing originating from the local oscillator. Spin echo
cancels most of the perturbations affecting the Ramsey experiments, and leaves
the residual phase noise of only $19$ mHz mostly attributed to the local
oscillator frequency instability, yielding the increased coherence time of
$11.9$ s which coincides with the contrast decay time in the Ramsey sequence. A
number of perturbation sources leading to homogeneous and inhomogeneous
dephasing is discussed. Our atom-chip sensor is useful in probing fundamental

First, we explicitly consider the hierarchical trajectory-generation process of
human drivers involving both discrete and continuous driving decisions. Based
on this, the distribution over all future trajectories of the predicted vehicle
is formulated as a mixture of distributions partitioned by the discrete
decisions. Then we apply IRL hierarchically to learn the distributions from

image and quantify these parameters in vivo without assuming incompressibility
of the tissue, an assumption that is rarely justified in human tissues.
Methods: In this paper, we develop a new method to simultaneously reconstruct
YM and PR of a tumor and of its surrounding tissues, irrespective of the
boundary conditions and the shape of the tumor based on ellipsoidal
approximation. This new non-invasive method allows the generation of high
spatial resolution YM and PR maps from axial and lateral strain data obtained
via ultrasound elastography. The method was validated using finite element (FE)
simulations and controlled experiments performed on phantoms with known
mechanical properties. The clinical feasibility of the developed method was
also demonstrated in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. Results: Our
results from simulations and controlled experiments demonstrate that the
proposed reconstruction technique is accurate and robust. Conclusion:
Availability of the proposed technique could address the clinical need of a
non-invasive modality capable of imaging, quantifying and monitoring the
mechanical properties of tumors with high spatial resolution and in real time.
Significance: This technique can have a significant impact on the clinical
translation of elasticity imaging methods.

Dykstra","The difference between Faradaic and non-Faradaic electrode processes",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Both Faradaic and non-Faradaic processes can take place at an electrode. The
difference between the two processes is clearly discussed in several classical
sources, starting with Grahame (1952). However, later reference to charge
transfer across the metal-solution interface as a defining feature of a
Faradaic process, has led to ambiguities. Following Grahame, in a Faradaic
process, charged particles transfer across the electrode, from one bulk phase
to another. Thus, in a Faradaic process, after applying a constant current, the
electrode charge, voltage and composition go to constant values. Instead, in a
non-Faradaic (capacitive) process, charge is progressively stored. We
characterize the intercalation material nickel hexacyanoferrate by two
electrochemical methods and compare with theory. Data for the capacitance of
this material is well described by the extended Frumkin isotherm. This data,
and the correspondence with theory, demonstrates that this is a capacitive
material and ion and charge storage in this material a non-Faradaic electrode
process. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) diagrams for this material have broad peaks
for certain potential windows, and rectangular shapes for other conditions,
both experimentally and in theoretical calculations based on a RC network model
that includes how capacitance is a function of charge. Measured and predicted
CV diagrams are in perfect agreement with one another. This shows that (broad)
peaks in CV diagrams do not establish whether an electrode material is Faradaic
or not.

contents. However, when content providers are strategic, the basic principle of
matching users to the closest content, where both users and contents are
modeled as points in some semantic space, may yield low social welfare. This is
due to the fact that content providers are strategic and optimize their offered
content to be recommended to as many users as possible. Motivated by modern
applications, we propose the widely studied framework of facility location
games to study recommendation systems with strategic content providers. Our
conceptual contribution is the introduction of a $\textit{mediator}$ to
facility location models, in the pursuit of better social welfare. We aim at
designing mediators that a) induce a game with high social welfare in
equilibrium, and b) intervene as little as possible. In service of the latter,
we introduce the notion of $\textit{intervention cost}$, which quantifies how
much damage a mediator may cause to the social welfare when an off-equilibrium
profile is adopted. As a case study in high-welfare low-intervention mediator
design, we consider the one-dimensional segment as the user domain. We propose
a mediator that implements the socially optimal strategy profile as the unique
equilibrium profile, and show a tight bound on its intervention cost.
Ultimately, we consider some extensions, and highlight open questions for the
general agenda.

real-time sensing applications over cellular networks, which sense the
conditions of the tasks and transmit the real-time sensory data to the base
station (BS). The performance of a UAV is determined by the performance of both
its sensing and transmission processes, which are influenced by the trajectory
of the UAV. However, it is challenging for UAVs to design their trajectories
efficiently, since they work in a dynamic environment. To tackle this
challenge, in this paper, we adopt the reinforcement learning framework to
solve the UAV trajectory design problem in a decentralized manner. To
coordinate multiple UAVs performing the real-time sensing tasks, we first
propose a sense-and-send protocol, and analyze the probability for successful
valid data transmission using nested Markov chains. Then, we formulate the
decentralized trajectory design problem and propose an enhanced multi-UAV
Q-learning algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results show that the
proposed enhanced multi-UAV Q-learning algorithm converges faster and achieves
higher utilities for the UAVs in the real-time task-sensing scenarios.

investigated as surrogate endpoints for overall survival (OS) in advanced
colorectal cancer (aCRC), however their validity has been shown to be
suboptimal. In recent years, meta-analytic methods allowing for use of multiple
surrogate endpoints jointly have been proposed. The aim of this research was to
assess if PFS and TR used jointly as surrogate endpoints to OS improve their
predictive value. Data were obtained from a systematic review of randomised
controlled trials investigating effectiveness of different pharmacological
therapies in aCRC: systemic chemotherapies, anti-epidermal growth factor
receptor therapies, anti-angiogenic agents, other multi-targeted antifolate
treatments and intra-hepatic arterial chemotherapy. Multivariate meta-analysis
was used to model the association patterns between treatment effects on the
surrogate endpoints (PFS, TR) and the final outcome (OS). Analysis of 33 trials
which reported treatment effects on all three outcomes showed reasonably strong
association between treatment effects on PFS and OS. A weak surrogate
relationship was noted between the treatment effects on TR and OS. Modelling
the two surrogate endpoints, TR and PFS, jointly as predictors of OS gave no
marked improvement in neither surrogacy patterns nor the precision of predicted
treatment effect in the cross-validation procedure. When investigating
subgroups of therapy, only small improvement in precision of predicted
treatment effects on the final outcome in studies investigating anti-angiogenic
therapy was noted. Overall, the simultaneous modelling of two surrogate
endpoints did not lead to improvement in association between treatment effects
on surrogate and final endpoints in aCRC.

hadrons, when weighted with the hadron transverse momentum $P_T$, allow for the
extraction of important transverse-momentum-dependent distribution functions.
In particular, the weighted Sivers asymmetries provide direct information on
the Sivers function, which is a leading-twist distribution that arises from a
correlation between the transverse momentum of an unpolarised quark in a
transversely polarised nucleon and the spin of the nucleon. Using the
high-statistics data collected by the COMPASS Collaboration in 2010 with a
transversely polarised proton target, we have evaluated two types of
$P_T$-weighted Sivers asymmetries, which are both proportional to the product
of the firsttransverse moment of the Sivers function and of the fragmentation
function. The results are compared to the standard unweighted Sivers
asymmetries and used to extract the first transverse moments of the Sivers
distributions for $u$ and $d$ quarks.

difficult to analyze using standard tools from dynamical systems theory. We
show that any CA may readily be represented using a convolutional neural

of a general convolutional multilayer perceptron architecture, which we find
can learn the dynamical rules for arbitrary CA when given videos of the CA as
training data. In the limit of large network widths, we find that training
dynamics are nearly identical across replicates, and that common patterns
emerge in the structure of networks trained on different CA rulesets. We train
ensembles of networks on randomly-sampled CA, and we probe how the trained
networks internally represent the CA rules using an information-theoretic
technique based on distributions of layer activation patterns. We find that CA
with simpler rule tables produce trained networks with hierarchical structure
and layer specialization, while more complex CA produce shallower
representations---illustrating how the underlying complexity of the CA's rules
influences the specificity of these internal representations. Our results
suggest how the entropy of a physical process can affect its representation

mitigates both the large classification space and class imbalance issues, but
also potentially increases data samples for each clustered category. We further
propose to incorporate depth information as an additional feature into the

the relationship prediction model in a way that bounding boxes or segmentation

that the logarithms of both $P_{e\_opt}$ and $P_{e\_pam}$ decrease

the transitions between these states as function of the vaccination and

disease with waning immunization like pertussis. For a diffusively coupled

are also wellknown. However, the variational approximation error has not been
clarified yet, because NMF is not statistically regular and the prior
distribution used in variational Bayesian NMF (VBNMF) has zero or divergence
points. In this paper, using algebraic geometrical methods, we theoretically
analyze the difference in negative log evidence (a.k.a. free energy) between
VBNMF and Bayesian NMF, i.e., the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
variational posterior and the true posterior. We derive an upper bound for the
learning coefficient (a.k.a. the real log canonical threshold) in Bayesian NMF.
By using the upper bound, we find a lower bound for the approximation error,
asymptotically. The result quantitatively shows how well the VBNMF algorithm
can approximate Bayesian NMF; the lower bound depends on the hyperparameters
and the true nonnegative rank. A numerical experiment demonstrates the
theoretical result.

identifiability test based on the Similarity Transformation Approach (STA) in
classical control theory and extend it to the domain of quantum Hamiltonian
identification. We employ STA to prove the identifiability of spin-1/2 chain
systems with arbitrary dimension assisted by single-qubit probes. We further
extend the traditional STA method by proposing a Structure Preserving
Transformation (SPT) method for non-minimal systems. We use the SPT method to
introduce an indicator for the existence of economic quantum Hamiltonian
identification algorithms, whose computational complexity directly depends on
the number of unknown parameters (which could be much smaller than the system
dimension). Finally, we give an example of such an economic Hamiltonian
identification algorithm and perform simulations to demonstrate its
effectiveness.

image and disentangle its mask areas conditioned on both the masked face image
and the estimated facial geometry images. Besides, since low-rank property
exists in manually labeled masks, a low-rank regularization term is imposed on
the disentangled masks, enforcing our completion network to manage occlusion
area with various shape and size. Furthermore, our network can generate diverse
results from the same masked input by modifying estimated facial geometry,
which provides a flexible mean to edit the completed face appearance. Extensive
experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our

One of them is to expand the transition amplitude in powers of $\vec{q}$ which
is the relative momentum between the quark and antiquark, and the other is to
expand the amplitude base on the wave functions. In the level of decay width,
the results show that, for the transition of $B_c\to \eta_c$, the relativistic
correction is about $22\%$; for $B_c\to J/\psi$, it is about $19\%$; the
relativistic effects of $1P$ final states are about $14\sim46\%$ larger than
those of $1S$ final states; for $2S$ final states, they are about $19\sim 28\%$

maximum molecular packing density under ambient conditions, even though a
higher density could be achieved under ultra-high pressure (Gigapascals). Such
solid-state phase changes are reversible, and hence this high density packing
is not able to maintain under ambient conditions. Alternatively, in this
research, we demonstrated a molecular level compression effect by stacking of
2-D TAGP, resulting in a higher density packing of the HMX molecules with
changed conformation. The HMX crystal formed under compression in the solvent
has a unit cell parameter very close to the reported one observed under
pressure of 0.2 GPa. It shows that the compressed HMX molecules are trapped in
the TAGP layers, resulting in a higher density (e.g. 2.13 g cm-3) and also
higher heat of formation. The resulted HMX crystals are free of defects, and
unlike the pristine HMX, no polymorphic transition and melting point were
observed upon heating. Experiments and relevant calculations show that the best
resulted hybrid HMX crystal has a detonation velocity of 10.40 km s-1 and

reversal(PT). However, there seems to exist a topological phase transition for
the one-dimensional Ising chain in a longitudinal field(LF) with the reduced

believe that the LF also could influence the PT-symmetry and there exists the
discontinuous BP. But the theoretic characterization has not been well founded.
This paper tries to aim at this problem. With the Jordan-Wigner transformation,
we give the four-fermion interaction form of the Hamiltonian in the
one-dimensional Ising chain with a LF. Further by the method of Wick's theorem
and the mean-field theory, the four-fermion interaction is well dealt with. We
solve the ground state energy and the ground wave function in the momentum

most precise mass excess of $^{27}$P to date to be $-659(9)$~keV, which is
63~keV (2.3$\sigma$) higher than the AME2016 recommended value of
$-722(26)$~keV. The experimentally unknown mass excess of $^{27}$S was
estimated to be 17030(400)~keV in AME2016, and we constrain this mass to be
17678(77)~keV based on the measured $\beta$-delayed two-proton energy. In the
temperature region of $(0.06-0.3)$~GK, the $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P reaction
rate determined in this work is significantly lower than the rate recommended
in the reaction rate libraries, up to two orders of magnitude around 0.1~GK.

hydrodynamic nova and post-processing XRB models. No substantial change was

detected previously and with clear optical counterparts. The X-ray fluxes of at
least 5 of these are above the nominal flux-limits of previous RASS cluster
catalogs. They have low mass ($10^{13} - 10^{14} M_{\odot}$; i.e., galaxy
groups), are at low redshift (z<0.08), and exhibit flatter surface brightness
distributions than usual. We demonstrate that galaxy groups were missed in
previous RASS surveys, possibly due to the flat surface brightness
distributions of this potential new population. Analysis of the full sample
will show if this might have a significant effect on previous cosmological
parameter constraints based on RASS cluster surveys. (This is a shortened

contextual dependencies based on the selfattention mechanism. Unlike previous
works that capture contexts by multi-scale features fusion, we propose a Dual
Attention Networks (DANet) to adaptively integrate local features with their
global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on
top of traditional dilated FCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in
spatial and channel dimensions respectively. The position attention module
selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the
features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other
regardless of their distances. Meanwhile, the channel attention module
selectively emphasizes interdependent channel maps by integrating associated
features among all channel maps. We sum the outputs of the two attention
modules to further improve feature representation which contributes to more
precise segmentation results. We achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation
performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes,
PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff dataset. In particular, a Mean IoU score of 81.5%
on Cityscapes test set is achieved without using coarse data. We make the code

for thermonuclear reaction rates of astrophysical interest and stringent test
for shell-model theories far from the stability line. Purpose: The available
decay properties of proton drip-line nucleus $^{27}$S is insufficient to
constrain the properties of the key resonance in $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P
reaction rate and probe the possible isospin asymmetry. The decay scheme of
$^{27}$S is complicated and far from being understood, which has motivated but
also presented challenges for our experiment. Method: The $^{27}$S ions were
implanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector array surrounded by the
high-purity germanium detectors, where the $\beta$-delayed protons and $\gamma$
rays were measured simultaneously. Results: The improved spectroscopic
properties including the precise half-life of $^{27}$S, the excitation
energies, $\beta$-decay branching ratios, log~$ft$ values, and $B$(GT) values
for the states of $^{27}$P populated in the $\beta$ decay of $^{27}$S were
measured and compared to the $^{27}$Mg mirror states and the shell-model
calculations. The present work has expanded greatly on the previously
established decay scheme of $^{27}$S. Conclusions: The precise
proton-separation energy of $^{27}$P, the energy and the ratio between $\gamma$

determining the $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate based mainly on
experimental constraints. The first evidence for the observation of a large
isospin asymmetry for the mirror decays of $^{27}$S and $^{27}$Na is also
provided. The experimental spectroscopic information can be reproduced by the
shell-model calculation taking the weakly bound effect of the proton $1s_{1/2}$

the classical version of this problem the input is a matrix $S\in
\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and a vector $b\in\mathbb{R}^n$ in the range of $S$,
and the goal is to output $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying $Sx=b$. For the case
when the matrix $S$ is symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD), the breakthrough
algorithm of Spielman and Teng [STOC 2004] approximately solves this problem in
near-linear time (in the input size which is the number of non-zeros in $S$),
and subsequent papers have further simplified, improved, and generalized the
algorithms for this setting.
  Here we focus on computing one (or a few) coordinates of $x$, which
potentially allows for sublinear algorithms. Formally, given an index $u\in
[n]$ together with $S$ and $b$ as above, the goal is to output an approximation
$\hat{x}_u$ for $x^*_u$, where $x^*$ is a fixed solution to $Sx=b$.
  Our results show that there is a qualitative gap between SDD matrices and the
more general class of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices. For SDD matrices,
we develop an algorithm that approximates a single coordinate $x_{u}$ in time
that is polylogarithmic in $n$, provided that $S$ is sparse and has a small
condition number (e.g., Laplacian of an expander graph). The approximation
guarantee is additive $| \hat{x}_u-x^*_u | \le \epsilon \| x^* \|_\infty$ for
accuracy parameter $\epsilon>0$. We further prove that the condition-number
assumption is necessary and tight.
  In contrast to the SDD matrices, we prove that for certain PSD matrices $S$,
the running time must be at least polynomial in $n$. This holds even when one
wants to obtain the same additive approximation, and $S$ has bounded sparsity
and condition number.

arises from brain matter. I suggest exploring the possibility that quantum
physics could be part of the answer. The simultaneous unity and complexity of
subjective experience is difficult to understand from a classical physics
perspective. In contrast, quantum entanglement is naturally both complex and
unified. Moreover the concept of matter is much more subtle in quantum physics
compared to classical physics, and quantum computing shows that quantum effects
can be useful for information processing. Building on recent progress in
quantum technology and neuroscience, I propose a concrete hypothesis as a basis
for further investigation, namely that subjective experience is related to the
dynamics of a complex entangled state of spins, which is continuously generated
and updated through the exchange of photons. Spins in condensed matter systems
at room or body temperature can have coherence times in the relevant range for
subjective experience (milliseconds to seconds). Photons are well suited for
distributing entanglement over macroscopic distances. Neurons emit photons,
reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria being likely sources. Opsins,
light-sensitive proteins that are plausible single-photon detectors, exist in
the brain and are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they serve a
function. We have recently shown by detailed numerical modeling that axons can
plausibly act as photonic waveguides. The oxygen molecule, which has non-zero
electronic spin and emits photons, might serve as an interface between photons
and spins. The achievable photon rates seem to be more than sufficient to
support the bandwidth of subjective experience. The proposed hypothesis raises
many interesting experimental and theoretical questions in neuroscience,
quantum physics, evolutionary biology, psychophysics, and philosophy.

hydrograph, and then finds the ""cuts"" in the drainage network that maximally
isolate these subcatchments, thereby flattening the hydrologic response.
Evaluating the performance of the algorithm through an ensemble of hydrodynamic

consistently flatter discharges than randomized controller
configurations---both in terms of the peak discharge and the overall variance
of the hydrograph. By attenuating flashy flows, our algorithm provides a

three-dimensional nonlinear magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) states are concerned.
The nonlinear MHD states, assumed to be predominantly driven by a
unidirectional shear, can be sustained without any linear instability of the
base flow and hence are responsible for subcritical transition to turbulence.
Two classes of nonlinear MHD states are found. The first class of nonlinear
states emerged out of a nice combination of the purely hydrodynamic vortex/wave
interaction theory by Hall \& Smith (1991) and the resonant absorption theories
on Alfv\'en waves, developed in the solar physics community (e.g. Sakurai et
al. 1991; Goossens et al. 1995). Similar to the hydrodynamic theory, the
mechanism of the MHD states can be explained by the successive interaction of
the roll, streak, and wave fields, which are now defined both for the
hydrodynamic and magnetic fields. The derivation of this `vortex/Alfv\'en wave
interaction' state is rather straightforward as the scalings for both of the
hydrodynamic and magnetic fields are identical. It turns out that the leading
order magnetic field of the asymptotic states appears only when a small
external magnetic field is present. However, it does not mean that purely
shear-driven dynamos are not possible. In fact, the second class of
`self-sustained shear driven dynamo theory' shows the magnetic generation that
is slightly smaller size in the absence of any external field. Despite small
size, the magnetic field causes the novel feedback mechanism in the velocity
field through resonant absorption, wherein the magnetic wave becomes more
strongly amplified than the hydrodynamic counterpart.

Deguchi (2019). To avoid any complexity associated with the chaotic nature of
turbulence and flow geometry, nonlinear steady solutions of the
viscous-resistive magneto-hydrodynamic equations in plane Couette flow have
been utilised. Two classes of nonlinear MHD states, which convert kinematic
energy to magnetic energy effectively, have been determined. The first class of
nonlinear states can be obtained when a small spanwise uniform magnetic field
is applied to the known hydrodynamic solution branch of the plane Couette flow.
The nonlinear states are characterised by the hydrodynamic/magnetic roll-streak
and the resonant layer at which strong vorticity and current sheets are
observed. These flow features, and the induced strong streamwise magnetic
field, are fully consistent with the vortex/Alfv\'en wave interaction theory
proposed in Deguchi (2019). When the spanwise uniform magnetic field is
switched off, the solutions become purely hydrodynamic. However, the second
class of `self-sustained shear driven dynamos' at the zero-external magnetic
field limit can be found by homotopy via the forced states subject to a
spanwise uniform current field. The discovery of the dynamo states has
motivated the corresponding large Reynolds number matched asymptotic analysis
in Deguchi (2019). Here, the reduced equations derived by the asymptotic theory
have been solved numerically. The asymptotic solution provides remarkably good
predictions for the finite Reynolds number dynamo solutions.

existence of a stationary distribution for the stochastic process describing
the disease dynamics over sufficiently longtime. The malaria system is highly
random with fluctuations from the disease transmission and natural deathrates,
which are expressed as independent white noise processes in a family of
stochastic differential equation epidemic models. Other sources of variability
in the malaria dynamics are the random incubation and naturally acquired
immunity periods of malaria. Improved analytical techniques and local
martingale characterizations are applied to describe the character of the
sample paths of the solution process of the system in the neighborhood of an
endemic equilibrium. Emphasis of this study is laid on examination of the
impacts of (1) the sources of variability- disease transmission and natural
death rates, and (2) the intensities of the white noise processes in the system
on the stochastic permanence of malaria, and also on the existence of the
stationary distribution for the solution process over sufficiently long time.
Numerical simulation examples are presented to illuminate the persistence and
stochastic permanence of malaria, and also to numerically approximate the
stationary distribution of the states of the solution process.

element-wise differences in the existing matrix norms may fail to capture
underlying topological differences. Further, matrix norms are sensitive to
outliers. A major disadvantage to element-wise distance calculations is that it
could be severely affected even by a small number of extreme edge weights. Thus
it is necessary to develop network distances that recognize topology. In this
paper, we provide a survey of bottleneck, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distances that are adapted for brain networks, and
compare them against matrix-norm based network distances. Bottleneck and
GH-distances are often used in persistent homology. However, they were rarely
utilized to measure similarity between brain networks. KS-distance is recently
introduced to measure the similarity between networks across different
filtration values. The performance analysis was conducted using the random
network simulations with the ground truths. Using a twin imaging study, which
provides biological ground truth, we demonstrate that the KS distance has the
ability to determine heritability.

to the electromagnetic interaction. First there is derived a modified Dirac
equation in the presence of a velocity dependent gauge field and isotopic field
charges (namely Coulomb and Lorentz type electric charges, as well as
gravitational and inertial masses). This equation is compared with the
classical Dirac equation. There is shown that, since the presence of isotopic
field-charges would distort the Lorentz invariance of the equation, there is a
transformation, which together with the Lorenz transformation restores the
invariance of the equation, in accordance with the conservation of the isotopic
field-charge spin (Darvas, 2009). The paper discusses the conclusions derived
from the extensions of the Dirac equation. It is shown that in semi-classical
approximation the model provides the original Dirac equation, and at
significantly relativistic velocities it approaches to the Schr\""odinger
equation. Among other conclusions, the clue gives physical meaning to the
electric moment. The closing section summarises a few further conclusions and
