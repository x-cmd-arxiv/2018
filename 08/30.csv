  Summer 2018",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has recently been shown that an interesting inverse relationship exists
between the strength of the overturning in the regional boreal Hadley
circulation and tropical cyclone genesis and lifetime maximum intensity
latitudes in the eastern North Pacific. One of the particularly curious aspects
of this association is its uniqueness to this ocean basin. We show here that
this result can be understood as the outcome of an equatorward shift in the
local Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a moderate reduction of
tropical vertical shear. These two factors are not necessarily concomitant. The
magnitude of the vertical shear change is low enough to suggest that the
primary physical mechanism behind this inverse relationship is the equatorward
shift in the ITCZ. Since a significant proportion of tropical cyclone genesis
results from aggregated convective cells forming into a coherent convective
vortex and being shed from the ITCZ, this shift is apparently sufficient to
explain the observed association. The equatorward shift in the ITCZ is
potentially the result of a relative warming of the Southern Hemisphere in the
boreal tropical cyclone season. This more equatorward ITCZ, located over warmer
surface waters, presumably explains the more intense Hadley circulation,
despite a reduction of the large-scale boreal meridional temperature gradient.
Although, these links require further research.

improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way as a
whole. The so-called Monoceros Ring might have been the result of satellite
accretion. Guglielmo et al. have used N-body simulations to search for the
progenitor of this structure. Their analysis shows that, if the Ring has a
dwarf galaxy progenitor, it might be found in the background of one out of
eight specific areas in the sky. Here, we use Gaia DR2 data to perform a
systematic exploration aimed at confirming or rejecting this remarkable
prediction. Focusing on the values of the radial velocity to uncover possible
multimodal spreads, we identify a bimodal Gaussian distribution towards
Galactic coordinates (l, b) = (271, +2) degrees in Vela, which is one of the
locations of the progenitor proposed by Guglielmo et al. This prominent feature
with central values 60+/-7 km/s and 97+/-10 km/s, may signal the presence of
the long sought progenitor of the Monoceros Ring, but the data might also be
compatible with the existence of an unrelated, previously unknown,
kinematically coherent structure.

  Users' Trustworthiness","10 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today's social media platforms enable to spread both authentic and fake news
very quickly. Some approaches have been proposed to automatically detect such
""fake"" news based on their content, but it is difficult to agree on universal
criteria of authenticity (which can be bypassed by adversaries once known).
Besides, it is obviously impossible to have each news item checked by a human.
  In this paper, we a mechanism to limit the spread of fake news which is not
based on content. It can be implemented as a plugin on a social media platform.
The principle is as follows: a team of fact-checkers reviews a small number of
news items (the most popular ones), which enables to have an estimation of each
user's inclination to share fake news items. Then, using a Bayesian approach,
we estimate the trustworthiness of future news items, and treat accordingly
those of them that pass a certain ""untrustworthiness"" threshold.
  We then evaluate the effectiveness and overhead of this technique on a large
Twitter graph. We show that having a few thousands users exposed to one given
news item enables to reach a very precise estimation of its reliability. We
thus identify more than 99% of fake news items with no false positives. The
performance impact is very small: the induced overhead on the 90th percentile
latency is less than 3%, and less than 8% on the throughput of user operations.

coherence scales and intriguing incoherent transport regimes, resulting in bad
metallic behavior. But to what extent are these strong correlations governed by
Mottness, i.e. the blocking of charge fluctuations close to a Mott insulator
transition (MIT) induced by $U$, or by Hundness, a new route towards strong
correlations induced by $J$? To answer this question, we study the full phase
diagram of a degenerate three-band Hubbard-Hund model on a Bethe lattice at
zero temperature using single-site DMFT and the numerical renormalization group
as efficient real-frequency multi-band impurity solver. Hund metal behavior
occurs in this minimal model for a filling close to $n_d=2$, moderate $U$ and
sizeable $J$, the ""Hund-metal regime"", with strong correlations manifest by a
low quasiparticle weight, $Z$. We show that ""spin-orbital separation"" (SOS) is
a generic $J$-induced feature in the whole metallic regime of the phase diagram
for $1<n_d<3$ and sizeable $J$: orbital screening occurs at much higher
energies than spin screening, below which Fermi-liquid behavior sets in. The
low $Z$ can then be explained in terms of the $J$-reduced Fermi-liquid scale.
We further show that, in the Hund-metal regime, far from any MIT, Hundness --
the localization of large spins -- is the key player to induce strong
correlations. There, physical properties are governed by a broad incoherent
energy regime of SOS with intriguing Hund metal physics: large, almost
unscreened spins are coupled to screened orbital degrees of freedom.

exponentially small in the braiding time only for completely smooth pulse

challenging. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting
questions about a knowledge graph (KG), which is inspired by formal approaches
to semantics. Each span of text is represented by a denotation in a KG and a
vector that captures ungrounded aspects of meaning. Learned composition modules
recursively combine constituent spans, culminating in a grounding for the
complete sentence which answers the question. For example, to interpret ""not
green"", the model represents ""green"" as a set of KG entities and ""not"" as a
trainable ungrounded vector---and then uses this vector to parameterize a
composition function that performs a complement operation. For each sentence,
we build a parse chart subsuming all possible parses, allowing the model to
jointly learn both the composition operators and output structure by gradient
descent from end-task supervision. The model learns a variety of challenging
semantic operators, such as quantifiers, disjunctions and composed relations,
and infers latent syntactic structure. It also generalizes well to longer
questions than seen in its training data, in contrast to RNN, its tree-based

evaluate several techniques for character-level NMT, verify that they do not

values) in a regime where back-action is negligible. The weak value appears
analogous to a classical conditional mean and in fact, has a number of features
that further suggest it may be interpreted as being related to some underlying

are complex and unbounded. Here, we study weak values in the context of a

results of the experiment are reinterpreted within a 'stochastic optics' model
of light. The model is based on standard (Maxwell) electromagnetic theory,
supplemented by stochastic fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields. We show
that the conditional means of the electric field intensities correspond to the
experimentally observed weak values. This is a provocative result, as it
suggests that at least within this experiment, the weak value gives us
information about the average of an ontological quantity (the intensity). We
study the breakdown of the stochastic optics model, which occurs outside the

arbitrarily small St\""uckelberg masses are forbidden. In particular, the limit
in which the mass goes to zero lies at infinite distance in field space, and
this distance is correlated with a tower of modes becoming light according to

emitting surface of warm debris, and is subsequently destroyed or assimilated
within a few years. The variations are consistent with debris that does not
change temperature, indicating that dust is produced and depleted within a
fixed range of orbital radii. Gas produced in collisions may rapidly
re-condense onto grains, or may accrete onto the white dwarf surface on viscous
timescales that are considerably longer than Poynting-Robertson drag for
micron-sized dust. This potential delay in mass accretion rate change is

a wide range of density environments and hence to constrain cosmology and
fundamental physics. To efficiently extract information from 21cm intensities
beyond average, one needs non-Gaussian statistics that capture large deviations
from mean HI density. Counts-in-cells statistics are ideally suited for this
purpose, as the statistics of matter densities in spheres can be predicted
accurately on scales where their variance is below unity.
  We use a large state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulation from the

remnant. Using a time-dependent one-zone model, we show that a single expanding
magnetized electron-ion nebula (powered by the same outbursts likely
responsible for the FRBs) can explain all the basic properties of the quiescent
source (size, flux, self-absorption constraints) and the large but decreasing
rotation measure (RM) of the bursts. The quiescent emission is powered by
relativistic thermal electrons heated at the termination shock of the magnetar
wind, while the RM originates from non-relativistic electrons injected earlier
in the nebula's evolution and cooled through expansion and radiative losses.
The model contains few free parameters, which are tightly constrained by
observations: the total energy injected into the nebula over its history, $\sim
10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg, agrees with the magnetic energy of a millisecond
magnetar; the baryon loading of the magnetar outflow (driven by intermittent
flares) is close to the neutron star escape speed; the predicted source age
$\sim 10-40$ years is consistent with other constraints on the nebula size. For
an energy input rate $\dot{E} \propto t^{-\alpha}$ following the onset of
magnetar activity, we predict secular decay of the RM and quiescent source
flux, which approximately follow ${\rm RM} \propto t^{-(6+\alpha)/2}$ and

photoionization of cool or warm gas by the metagalactic radiation takes over
near $z\sim2$. In halos of $\sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and above, collisions become
important again at $z<0.5$, while photoionization remains significant down to

galactic models with different halo masses between 10e10 Msol and 10e12 Msol,
and for each we use two different approaches to seed the magnetic field, as
well as a control simulation without a magnetic field. We find that the
amplification of the magnetic field in the centre of the disc leads to a
biconical magnetic outflow of gas that magnetizes the CGM. This biconical
magnetic outflow reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxy by roughly
40 percent compared to the simulations without magnetic fields. As the key
aspect of our simulations, we find that small scale turbulent motion of the gas
in the disc leads to the amplification of the magnetic field up to tens of
10e-6 G, as long as the magnetic field strength is low. For stronger magnetic
fields turbulent motion does not lead to significant amplification but is
replaced by an alpha-omega dynamo. The occurance of a small scale turbulent
dynamo becomes apparent through the magnetic power spectrum and analysis of the
field lines' curvature. In accordance with recent observations we find an
anti-correlation between the spiral structure in the gas density and in the

is sodium chloride dihydrate, or ""hydrohalite"" (NaCl $\cdot$ 2H$_2$O), which
can precipitate in bare sea ice at low temperatures. Unlike salt-free water
ice, hydrohalite is highly reflective in the near-infrared, where M-dwarf stars
emit strongly, making the effect of the interaction between hydrohalite and the
M-dwarf SED necessary to quantify. We carried out the first exploration of the
climatic effect of hydrohalite-induced salt-albedo feedback on extrasolar
planets, using a three-dimensional global climate model. Under fixed CO$_2$
conditions, rapidly-rotating habitable-zone M-dwarf planets receiving 65% or
less of the modern solar constant from their host stars exhibit cooler
temperatures when an albedo parameterization for hydrohalite is included in
climate simulations, compared to simulations without such a parameterization.
Differences in global mean surface temperature with and without this
parameterization increase as the instellation is lowered, which may increase
CO$_2$ build-up requirements for habitable conditions on planets with active
carbon cycles. Synchronously-rotating habitable-zone M-dwarf planets appear
susceptible to salt-albedo feedback at higher levels of instellation (90% or
less of the modern solar constant) than planets with Earth-like rotation
periods, due to their cooler minimum day-side temperatures. These instellation
levels where hydrohalite seems most relevant correspond to several
recently-discovered potentially habitable M-dwarf planets, including Proxima
Centauri b, TRAPPIST-1e, and LHS 1140b, making an albedo parameterization for
hydrohalite of immediate importance in future climate simulations.

projected separations $R_{{\rm proj}}\leq 60$ kpc. The velocity separation for
pairs was required to be $\Delta v \leq 500 \mbox{ km s}^{-1}$, which is a
standard threshold for defining interacting galaxy pairs at low redshift.
Stellar mass ratios in our sample range from 1.1 to 550, with 12 ratios closer
than or equal to 3:1, the common definition of a ""major merger."" Studies of
merging pairs in the local universe indicate anenhancement in star-formation
activity and deficit in gas-phase oxygen abundance relative to isolated
galaxies of the same mass. We compare the MOSDEF pairs sample to a control
sample of isolated galaxies at the same redshift, finding no measurable SFR
enhancement or metallicity deficit at fixed stellar mass for the pairs sample.
The lack of significant difference between the average properties of pairs and
control samples appears in contrast to results from low-redshift studies,
although the small sample size and lower signal-to-noise of the high-redshift
data limit definitive conclusions on redshift evolution. These results are
consistent with some theoretical works suggesting a reduced differential effect
of pre-coalescence mergers on galaxy properties at high redshift --
specifically that pre-coalescence mergers do not drive strong starbursts.

\textit{direct} collapse of pristine gas require a metal-free atomic cooling
halo with extremely low H$_2$ fraction, allowing the gas to cool isothermally
in the presence of atomic hydrogen. In order to achieve this
chemo-thermodynamical state, the gas needs to be irradiated by both:
Lyman-Werner (LW) photons in the energy range $11.2-13.6$ eV capable of
photodissociating H$_2$, and $0.76$ eV photons capable of photodetaching H$^-$.
Employing cosmological simulations capable of creating the first galaxies in
high resolution, we explore if there exists a subset that favours DCBH
formation in their vicinity. We find a fundamental relation between the maximum
distance at which a galaxy can cause DCBH formation and its star formation rate
(SFR), which automatically folds in the chemo-thermodynamical effects of both
H$_2$ photo-dissociation and H$^-$ photo-detachment. This is in contrast to the
scatter in the LW flux parameter seen at the maximum distance. It shows up to a
3 order of magnitude scatter, which can be interpreted as a scatter in
`J$_{crit}$'. Thus, computing the rates and/or the LW flux from a galaxy is no
longer necessary to identify neighbouring sites of DCBH formation, as our
relation allows one to distinguish regions where DCBH formation could be
triggered in the vicinity of a galaxy of a given SFR.

large class of quasilinear wave equations satisfying the `weak null condition'
of Lindblad and Rodnianski, significantly enlarging upon the class of equations
for which global existence is known. In addition to the usual weak null
condition, we require a certain hierarchical structure in the semilinear terms.
Included in this class are the Einstein equations in harmonic coordinates, so a
special case of our results is a new proof of the stability of Minkowski space.
Our proof also applies to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell system in harmonic
coordinates and Lorenz gauge, as well as to various model scalar wave equations
which do not satisfy the null condition. Our proof also applies to the
Einstein(-Maxwell) equations if, after writing the equations as a set of
nonlinear wave equations, we then `forget' about the gauge conditions. The
methods we use allow us to treat initial data which only has a small
`degenerate energy', involving a weight that degenerates at null infinity, so
the usual (unweighted) energy might be unbounded. We also demonstrate a
connection between the weak null condition and geometric shock formation,
showing that equations satisfying the weak null condition can exhibit `shock
formation at infinity', of which we provide an explicit example. The methods
that we use are very robust, including a generalisation of the p-weighted
energy method of Dafermos and Rodnianski, adapted to the dynamic geometry. This
means that our proof applies in a wide range of situations, including those in
which the metric remains close to, but never approaches the flat metric in some
spatially bounded domain, and those in which the `geometric' null infinity and
the `background' null infinity differ dramatically, for example, when the
solution exhibits shock formation at null infinity.

compactifications. In the first half of the work, I discuss the Hodge plot of
Calabi-Yau threefolds realised as hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The
intricate structure of this plot is explained by the existence of certain webs
of elliptic-K3 fibrations. Such manifolds arise from reflexive polytopes that
can be cut into two parts along K3 slices. Any two half-polytopes over a given
slice can be combined into a reflexive polytope. This fact, together with a
remarkable relation on the additivity of Hodge numbers, give to the Hodge plot
the appearance of a fractal. Moving on, I discuss a different type of web by
looking at smooth $\mathbb{Z}_3$-quotients of complete intersection Calabi-Yau
threefolds in products of projective spaces. In the second half of the work, I
explore an algorithmic approach to constructing heterotic compactifications
with holomorphic and polystable sums of line bundles over complete intersection
Calabi-Yau threefolds that admit freely acting discrete symmetries. Such
abelian bundles lead to $N=1$ GUT theories with gauge group $SU(5)\times U(4)$.
The extra $U(1)$ symmetries are generically Green-Schwarz anomalous and survive
in the low energy theory as global symmetries that constrain the allowed
operators. The line bundle construction allows for a systematic computer search
resulting in a plethora of models with one or more pairs of Higgs doublets and
no exotic fields charged under the Standard Model group. In the last part of
the thesis I focus on the case study of the tetraquadric threefold and address
the question of the finiteness of the class of consistent and physically viable
line bundle models on this manifold. Line bundle sums provide an accessible
window into the moduli space of non-abelian bundles. I explore this moduli
space around the abelian locus using monad bundles.

paradigm is based on digital (hence scalable) machines represented by
appropriate electrical circuits with memory. These machines can be either built
in hardware or, as we do here, their equations of motion can be efficiently

architecture of memcomputing machines specifically designed to solve for the
linear inequalities representing a general ILP problem. We call these
self-organizing algebraic circuits, since they self-organize dynamically to
satisfy the correct (algebraic) linear inequalities. We then show simulations
of these machines using MATLAB running on a single core of a Xeon processor for
several ILP benchmark problems taken from the MIPLIB 2010 library, and compare
our results against a renowned commercial solver. We show that our approach is
very efficient when dealing with these hard problems. In particular, we find
within minutes feasible solutions for one of these hard problems (f2000 from
MIPLIB 2010) whose feasibility, to the best of our knowledge, has remained
unknown for the past eight years.

methods, we treat the problem as a neural structured prediction task, allowing
hard and soft constraints to steer the model away from unlikely predictions. We
show that the new model significantly outperforms earlier systems on a
benchmark dataset for procedural text comprehension (+8% relative gain), and
that it also avoids some of the nonsensical predictions that earlier systems
make.

  Our results show that group calibration is the fairness criterion that
unconstrained learning implicitly favors. On the one hand, this means that
calibration is often satisfied on its own without the need for active

have focused on inferring their atmospheric properties such as chemical

surface inhomogeneities in the host stars of exoplanets in the form of cool

planetary transit spectrum. Here we present Aura, a new retrieval paradigm for
inferring both planetary and stellar properties from a transmission spectrum.
We apply our retrieval framework to a sample of hot giant exoplanets to
determine the significance of stellar heterogeneity and clouds/hazes in their
spectra. The retrieval analyses distinguish four groups of planets. First, the
spectra of WASP-6b and WASP-39b are best characterised by imprints of stellar
heterogeneity and hazes and/or clouds. HD 209458b and HAT-P-12b comprise the
second group for which there is weak evidence for stellar heterogeneity and a
high significance of hazes and/or clouds. The third group constitutes HAT-P-1b
and WASP-31b and shows weak evidence against stellar heterogeneity but weak to
substantial indications of clouds/hazes. The fourth group -- WASP-19b,
WASP-17b, and WASP-12b -- is fit best by molecular and alkali absorbers with
H$_2$ scattering without evidence for stellar heterogeneity and weak to no
evidence for clouds/hazes. Our retrieval methodology paves the way to
simultaneous information on the star and planet from higher resolution spectra
using future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope and large
ground-based facilities.

posterior probability of the highest posterior density region, which is tangent
to the set defined by $H_0$. An important practical issue for the
implementation of the FBST is the determination of how large the evidence must
be in order to decide for its rejection. In the Classical significance tests,
the most used measure for rejecting a hypothesis is p-value. It is known that
p-value decreases as sample size increases, so by setting a single significance
level, it usually leads $H_0$ rejection. In the FBST procedure, the evidence in
favor of $H_0$ exhibits the same behavior as the p-value when the sample size
increases. This suggests that the cut-off point to define the rejection of
$H_0$ in the FBST should be a sample size function. In this work, we focus on
the case of two-sided normal mean hypothesis testing and present a method to
find a cut-off value for the evidence in the FBST by minimizing the linear

  at the University of Maryland Electron Ring","PhD Dissertation from University of Maryland",,,"umd18927","physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional particle accelerators use linear focusing forces for transverse
confinement. As a consequence of linearity, accelerating rings are sensitive to
myriad resonances and instabilities. At high beam intensity, uncontrolled
resonance-driven losses can deteriorate beam quality and cause damage or
radio-activation in beam line components and surrounding areas. This is
currently a major limitation of achievable current densities in
state-of-the-art accelerators. Incorporating nonlinear focusing forces into
machine design should provide immunity to resonances through nonlinear detuning
of particle orbits from driving terms. A theory of nonlinear integrable beam
optics is currently being investigated for use in accelerator rings. Such a
system has potential to overcome the limits on achievable beam intensity.
  This dissertation presents a plan for implementing a proof-of-principle
quasi-integrable octupole lattice at the University of Maryland Electron Ring
(UMER). UMER is an accelerator platform that supports the study of
high-intensity beam dynamics. In this dissertation, two designs are presented
that differ in both complexity and strength of predicted effects. A
configuration with a single, relatively long octupole magnet is expected to be
more stabilizing than an arrangement of many short, distributed octupoles.
  Preparation for this experiment required the development and characterization
of a low-intensity regime previously not operated at UMER. Additionally,
required tolerances for the control of first and second order beam moments in
the proposed experiments have been determined on the basis of simulated beam
dynamics. In order to achieve these tolerances, a new method for improved orbit
correction is developed. Finally, a study of resonance-driven losses in the
linear UMER lattice is discussed.

into their genetic basis, we study how liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) depends on their sequence charge
patterns using a continuum Langevin chain model wherein each amino acid residue
is represented by a single bead. Charge patterns are characterized by the
`blockiness' measure $\kappa$ and the `sequence charge decoration' (SCD)
parameter. Consistent with random phase approximation (RPA) theory and lattice
simulations, LLPS propensity as characterized by critical temperature $T^*_{\rm
cr}$ increases with increasingly negative SCD for a set of sequences showing a
positive correlation between $\kappa$ and $-$SCD. Relative to RPA, the
simulated sequence-dependent variation in $T^*_{\rm cr}$ is often---though not
always---smaller, whereas the simulated critical volume fractions are higher.
However, for a set of sequences exhibiting an anti-correlation between $\kappa$
and $-$SCD, the simulated $T^*_{\rm cr}$'s are quite insensitive to either
parameters. Additionally, we find that blocky sequences that allow for strong
electrostatic repulsion can lead to coexistence curves with upward concavity as
stipulated by RPA, but the LLPS propensity of a strictly alternating charge
sequence was likely overestimated by RPA and lattice models because interchain
stabilization of this sequence requires spatial alignments that are difficult
to achieve in real space. These results help delineate the utility and
limitations of the charge pattern parameters and of RPA, pointing to further
efforts necessary for rationalizing the newly observed subtleties.

is placed. While one of them has been studied previously using protein data
only, the other is novel and yields a simple approach requiring only the

frameworks, discretising the spatial space is not required here. Both GP models

fundamental breathing mode of the light-sound cavities. The coupling to
mechanical frequencies two orders of magnitude larger than alternative
approaches is attained without reduction of the optomechanical constant $g_0$.
The wavelength dependence of the optomechanical coupling further proves the
role of resonant photoelastic interaction, highlighting the potentiality to
access strong-coupling regimes. The experimental results show that
electrostrictive forces allow for the design of devices optimized to
selectively couple to specific mechanical modes. Our proposal opens up exciting
opportunities towards the implementation of novel approaches applicable in
quantum and ultra-high frequency information technologies.

relies on the recognition of iris images obtained in visible spectrum under
unconstrained environments. In this scenario, the acquired iris are affected by
capture distance, rotation, blur, motion blur, low contrast and specular
reflection, creating noises that disturb the iris recognition systems. Besides
delineating the iris region, usually preprocessing techniques such as
normalization and segmentation of noisy iris images are employed to minimize
these problems. But these techniques inevitably run into some errors. In this

architectures based on VGG and ResNet-50 networks, for dealing with the images
using (and not) iris segmentation and normalization. We use transfer learning

the empirical software engineering world. Predicting software defects before
the maintenance phase is very important not only to decrease the maintenance

different types of product, process, and developer based software metrics
proposed so far to measure the defectiveness of a software system. This paper
suggests to use a novel set of software metrics which are based on the
similarities detected among the source code files in a software project. To
find source code similarities among different files of a software system,
plagiarism and clone detection techniques are used. Two simple similarity
metrics are calculated for each file, considering its overall similarity to the
defective and non defective files in the project. Using these similarity
metrics, we predict whether a specific file is defective or not. Our
experiments on 10 open source data sets show that depending on the amount of
detected similarity, proposed metrics could achieve significantly better
performance compared to the existing static code metrics in terms of the area
under the curve (AUC).

the presence of a close binary, which would make this BSS system a hierarchical

hydrostatic pressures up to 2.13 GPa are reported for single-crystalline,
superconducting BaBi$_3$. A temperature - pressure phase diagram is determined
and the results suggest three different superconducting phases ${\alpha}$,
$\beta$, and $\gamma$ in the studied pressure range. We further show that
occurrence of the three superconducting phases is intuitively linked to phase
transitions at higher temperature which are likely first order in nature.
$T_p$, which separates phase ${\alpha}$ from $\beta$ and $\gamma$, is
associated with an abrupt resistance change as pressure is increased from 0.27
GPa to 0.33 GPa. Above 0.33 GPa, an ""S-shape"" anomaly in the
temperature-dependent resistance curve, $T_\text S$, is observed and associated
with the transition between the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ phases. Further increasing
of pressure above 1.05 GPa suppresses this transition and BaBi$_3$ stays in
$\gamma$ phase over the whole investigated temperature range. These
high-temperature anomalies are likely related to structural degrees of freedom.
With the ${\alpha}$ phase being the ambient-pressure tetragonal structure
($P4/mmm$), our first-principle calculations suggest the $\beta$ phase to be
cubic structure ($Pm-3m$) and the $\gamma$ phase to be a distorted tetragonal
structure where the Bi atoms are moved out of the face-centered position.
Finally, an analysis of the evolution of the superconducting upper critical
field with pressure further confirms these transitions in the superconducting
state and suggests a possible change of band structure or a Lifshitz transition
near 1.54 GPa in $\gamma$ phase. Given the large atomic numbers of both Ba and
Bi, our results establish BaBi$_3$ as a good candidate for the study of the
interplay of structure with superconductivity in the presence of strong
spin-orbit coupling.

saturate a set of bounds on the spread of quantum information. In this paper we
question whether non-locality can affect such bounds. Specifically, we consider
the gravity dual of a prototypical theory with non-local interactions, namely,
$\mathcal{N}=4$ non-commutative super Yang Mills. We construct shock waves
geometries that correspond to perturbations of the thermofield double state
with definite momentum and study several chaos related properties of the
theory, including the butterfly velocity, the entanglement velocity, the
scrambling time and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The latter two are
unaffected by the non-commutative parameter $\theta$, however, both the
butterfly and entanglement velocities increase with the strength of the
non-commutativity. This implies that non-local interactions can enhance the
effective light-cone for the transfer of quantum information, eluding
previously conjectured bounds encountered in the context of local quantum field
theory. We comment on a possible limitation on the retrieval of quantum
information imposed by non-locality.

missing CGs that failed the isolation criterion because of velocity outliers
lying in the isolation annulus. The new CG sample picks up lower surface
brightness groups, which are both looser and with fainter brightest galaxies,
missed by the classic method. A new catalogue of compact groups from the Sloan

available sample comprises $462$ observational groups with four or more galaxy
members, of which $406$ clearly fulfil all the compact group requirements:
compactness, isolation, and velocity concordance of all of their members. The
remaining $56$ groups need further redshift information of potentially
contaminating sources. This constitutes the largest sample of groups that
strictly satisfy all the Hickson's criteria in a survey with available

gravitational-wave interferometers to detect the inspiral of binary neutron

We quantify the ability to predict a GRB by computing the time a binary neutron
star (BNS) system takes to inspiral from its moment of detection to its final
merger. We define the moment of detection to be the instant at which the
interferometer network accumulates a signal-to-noise ratio of 15. For our
computations, we specifically consider BNS systems at luminosity distances of
(i) $D\le200\,$Mpc for the three-interferometer Advanced-LIGO-Virgo network of
2020, and (ii) $D\le 1000\,$Mpc for Einstein Telescope's B and C
configurations. In the case of Advanced LIGO-Virgo we find that we may at best
get a few minutes of warning time, thus we expect no forecast of GRBs in the
2020s. On the other hand, Einstein Telescope will provide us with advance
warning times of more than five hours for $D\le 100$Mpc. Taking one hour as a
benchmark advance warning time, we obtain a corresponding range of roughly 600
Mpc for the Einstein Telescope C configuration. Using current BNS merger event
rates within this volume, we show that Einstein C will forecast
$\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ GRBs in the 2030s. We reapply our warning-time
computation to black hole - neutron star inspirals and find one to three tidal
disruption events to be forecast by the same detector. This is a pedagogical

examine the empirical and theoretical behaviors of QDA where p grows
proportionally to the sample sizes without imposing any structural assumption

QDA can perform as poorly as random guessing even when the two populations
deviate significantly. This motivates a generalized version of QDA that
automatically adapts to dimensionality. Under a finite fourth moment condition,
we derive misclassification rates for both the generalized QDA and the optimal
one. A direct comparison reveals one ""easy"" case where the difference between
two rates converges to zero and one ""hard"" case where that converges to some

one-dimensional lattice. In particular, we consider what happens when the
wavefunction reaches a boundary at which the Hamiltonian changes suddenly from
one topological phase to another. An exact solution is constructed for the
wavefunction on both sides of the boundary. Under some conditions, it is found
that the probability of transition into the region of the second, topologically
distinct Hamiltonian is strongly suppressed. When the boundary is encountered,
the wavefunctions tend to be strongly reflected, and by appropriate choice of
system parameters leakage into the second region can be made negligible.
Therefore, it is possible to arrange a high degree of bulk wavefunction
localization within in each region. This `topologically-assisted' suppression
of transitions, although not of direct topological origin itself, exists only
because of the presence of a change in the topological properties of the
Hamiltonian. We give a quantitative examination of the reflection and

possible timing precision from an array of the most spin-stable pulsars. We can
improve the sensitivity of a pulsar timing array (PTA) to different
gravitational-wave sources by observing pulsars with low timing noise over
years to decades and distributed across the sky. We discuss observing
strategies for a PTA focused on a stochastic gravitational-wave background such
as from unresolved supermassive black hole binaries as well as focused on
single continuous-wave sources. First we describe the method to calculate a
PTA's sensitivity to different gravitational-wave-source classes. We then apply
our method to the 45 pulsars presented in the North American Nanohertz
Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 11-year data set. For expected
amplitudes of the stochastic background, we find that all pulsars contribute
significantly over the timescale of decades; the exception is for very
pessimistic values of the stochastic background amplitude. For individual
single sources, we find that a number of pulsars contribute to the sensitivity
of a given source but that which pulsars contribute are different depending on
the source, or versus an all-sky metric. Our results seem robust to the
presence of temporally-correlated red noise in pulsar arrival times. It is
critical to obtain more robust pulsar-noise parameters as they heavily affect
our results. Our results show that it is also imperative to locate and time as
many high-precision pulsars as possible, as quickly as possible, to maximize
the sensitivity of next-generation PTA detectors.

more precise information about an underlying scene. Hyperspectral-multispectral

since it allows the generation of high spatial resolution HS images,
circumventing the main limitation of this imaging modality. Existing HS-MS
fusion algorithms, however, neglect the spectral variability often existing
between images acquired at different time instants. This time difference causes
variations in spectral signatures of the underlying constituent materials due
to different acquisition and seasonal conditions. This paper introduces a novel
HS-MS image fusion strategy that combines an unmixing-based formulation with an
explicit parametric model for typical spectral variability between the two
images. Simulations with synthetic and real data show that the proposed
strategy leads to a significant performance improvement under spectral
variability and state-of-the-art performance otherwise.

graph convolutional networks (GCN), which nicely integrate local vertex
features and graph topology in the spectral domain. However, current studies
suffer from several drawbacks: (1) graph CNNs relies on Chebyshev polynomial
approximation which results in oscillatory approximation at jump
discontinuities; (2) Increasing the order of Chebyshev polynomial can reduce
the oscillations issue, but also incurs unaffordable computational cost; (3)
Chebyshev polynomials require degree $\Omega$(poly(1/$\epsilon$)) to
approximate a jump signal such as $|x|$, while rational function only needs
$\mathcal{O}$(poly log(1/$\epsilon$))\cite{liang2016deep,telgarsky2017neural}.
However, it's non-trivial to apply rational approximation without increasing
computational complexity due to the denominator. In this paper, the superiority
of rational approximation is exploited for graph signal recovering. RatioanlNet
is proposed to integrate rational function and neural networks. We show that
rational function of eigenvalues can be rewritten as a function of graph
Laplacian, which can avoid multiplication by the eigenvector matrix. Focusing
on the analysis of approximation on graph convolution operation, a graph signal
regression task is formulated. Under graph signal regression task, its time
complexity can be significantly reduced by graph Fourier transform. To overcome
the local minimum problem of neural networks model, a relaxed Remez algorithm
is utilized to initialize the weight parameters. Convergence rate of
RatioanlNet and polynomial based methods on jump signal is analyzed for a
theoretical guarantee. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our
approach could effectively characterize the jump discontinuities, outperforming
competing methods by a substantial margin on both synthetic and real-world

problem: after being projected into a joint embedding space, a visual sample
will match against all candidate class-level semantic descriptions and be
assigned to the nearest class. In this process, the embedding space underpins
the success of such matching and is crucial for ZSL. In this paper, we conduct
an in-depth study on the construction of embedding space for ZSL and posit that
an ideal embedding space should satisfy two criteria: intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. While the former encourages the embeddings of
visual samples of one class to distribute tightly close to the semantic
description embedding of this class, the latter requires embeddings from
different classes to be well separated from each other. Towards this goal, we
present a simple but effective two-branch network to simultaneously map
semantic descriptions and visual samples into a joint space, on which visual
embeddings are forced to regress to their class-level semantic embeddings and
the embeddings crossing classes are required to be distinguishable by a
trainable classifier. Furthermore, we extend our method to a transductive
setting to better handle the model bias problem in ZSL (i.e., samples from
unseen classes tend to be categorized into seen classes) with minimal extra
supervision. Specifically, we propose a pseudo labeling strategy to
progressively incorporate the testing samples into the training process and
thus balance the model between seen and unseen classes. Experimental results on

examples: Given a pair of objects we want to return a value which indicates
degree of (dis)similarity. Similarity is often task specific, and pre-defined
distances can perform poorly, leading to work in metric learning. However,
being able to learn a similarity-sensitive distance function also presupposes
access to a rich, discriminative representation for the objects at hand. In
this dissertation we present contributions towards both ends. In the first part
of the thesis, assuming good representations for the data, we present a
formulation for metric learning that makes a more direct attempt to optimize
for the k-NN accuracy as compared to prior work. We also present extensions of
this formulation to metric learning for kNN regression, asymmetric similarity
learning and discriminative learning of Hamming distance. In the second part,
we consider a situation where we are on a limited computational budget i.e.
optimizing over a space of possible metrics would be infeasible, but access to
a label aware distance metric is still desirable. We present a simple, and
computationally inexpensive approach for estimating a well motivated metric
that relies only on gradient estimates, discussing theoretical and experimental
results. In the final part, we address representational issues, considering
group equivariant convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). Equivariance to
symmetry transformations is explicitly encoded in GCNNs; a classical CNN being
the simplest example. In particular, we present a SO(3)-equivariant neural
network architecture for spherical data, that operates entirely in Fourier
space, while also providing a formalism for the design of fully Fourier neural
networks that are equivariant to the action of any continuous compact group.

includes one million firms and five million supplier-customer links. This study
finds that this network forms a tightly-knit structure with a core giant
strongly connected component (GSCC) surrounded by IN and OUT components
constituting two half-shells of the GSCC, which we call a\textit{walnut}
structure because of its shape. The hierarchical structure of the communities
is studied by the Infomap method, and most of the irreducible communities are
found to be at the second level. The composition of some of the major
communities, including overexpressions regarding their industrial or regional
nature, and the connections that exist between the communities are studied in
detail. The findings obtained here cause us to question the validity and
accuracy of using the conventional input-output analysis, which is expected to
be useful when firms in the same sectors are highly connected to each other.

handling unordered, arbitrary number of input images, we merge all the input

performance using a Markov chain model. Based on the MAC layer scheme, a novel
non-cooperative game is proposed to jointly adjust sensor node's transmit power

empirical data shows that the proposed approach leads to higher throughput and
longer node lifespan as WBAN wearers dynamically move into each other's

game is developed, which significantly reduces the latency. Both proposed games

Its automatic analysis has there-fore many applications, e.g., human-machine
interface. In this paper, we propose an emotional tonal speech dataset, namely
Mandarin Chinese Emotional Speech Dataset - Portrayed (MES-P), with both distal
and proximal labels. In contrast with state of the art emotional speech
datasets which are only focused on perceived emotions, the proposed MES-P
dataset includes not only perceived emotions with their proximal labels but
also intended emotions with distal labels, thereby making it possible to study
human emotional intelligence, i.e. people emotion expression ability and their
skill of understanding emotions, thus explicitly accounting for perception
differences between intended and perceived emotions in speech signals and
enabling studies of emotional misunderstandings which often occur in real life.
Furthermore, the proposed MES-P dataset also captures a main feature of tonal
languages, i.e., tonal variations, and provides recorded emotional speech
samples whose tonal variations match the tonal distribution in real life
Mandarin Chinese. Besides, the proposed MES-P dataset features emotion
intensity variations as well, and includes both moderate and intense versions
of recordings for joy, anger, and sadness in addition to neutral speech.
Ratings of the collected speech samples are made in valence-arousal space
through continuous coordinate locations, resulting in an emotional distribution
pattern in 2D VA space. The consistency between the speakers' emotional
intentions and the listeners' perceptions is also studied using Cohen's Kappa
coefficients. Finally, we also carry out extensive experiments using a baseline
on MES-P for automatic emotion recognition and compare the results with human
emotion intelligence.

numerical evidence for the free rotor and hydrogen atom also shows the
agreement between the two theories can break down quickly. For the radial
Rydberg wave packet in hydrogen atom, the breakdown can occur before
spontaneous emission and thus could be tested experimentally. Our surprising
result shows relativistic quantum mechanics must be used, instead of the
approximate non-relativistic theory, to correctly study quantum dynamics in the

machine learning in distributed settings, where a machine learning model is
trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local
computation and message passing. Such an iterative process could cause privacy
concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential
privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on
differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee
and often assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth
and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel
differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called
DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with
time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher
utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy
guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to bound the end-to-end
privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that DP-ADMM can be applied to a
wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and
offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for
differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The
evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence
and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.

there exists a computable function G such that, for any n, the statement `All

Especially challenging was a long-duration >100 MeV $\gamma$-ray burst probably

question of how high-energy protons could reach the Earth-facing solar surface.
Some preceding studies discussed a scenario in which protons accelerated by a

results indicate that the emissions observed from the Earth's direction were
generated by flare-accelerated electrons and protons trapped in static long
coronal loops. Their reacceleration is possible in these loops by a shock wave,
which was excited by the eruption, being initially not CME-driven. The results
highlight the ways to address remaining questions.

For a particular case of dS-to-dS tunneling, we calculated the wave function

the effects of the difference in modeling of the tracer profile of this galaxy
on the dynamical mass estimate. To do this, we assume that the tracer densities
are modeled with power-law and S\'ersic profiles, and then we solve the
spherical Jeans equation to estimate the dynamical mass. Applying these models
to kinematic data of globular clusters in NGC1052-DF2, we compare 90 per cent
upper limits of dynamical mass-to-light ratios estimated between from this
analysis and from vD18. We find that the upper limit obtained by the power-law
is virtually the same as the result from vD18, whilst this limit estimated by
the S\'ersic is significantly greater than that from vD18, thereby suggesting
that NGC1052-DF2 can still be a dark-matter dominated system. Consequently, we
propose that dynamical mass estimate of a galaxy is largely affected by not
only small kinematic sample but the choice of tracer distributions, and thus
the estimated mass still remains quite uncertain.

deterministic sequence $\{a_n\}$. This walk has the peculiar property that if
we set $a_n$ to be $+\infty$ for all $n$, it converges to a stationary
distribution $\pi(\cdot)$; but if $a_n$ is uniformly bounded (over all $n$) by
any upper bound $a \in (0,\infty)$, this walk diverges to infinity with
probability 1. It is thus interesting to consider the intermediate case where
$a_n<\infty$ for all $n$ but $a_n$ eventually tends to $+\infty$.
  (Latuszynski et al., 2013) first defined this walk and conjectured that a
particular choice of sequence $\{a_n\}$ exists such that (i) $a_n \to \infty$

is weaker than (ii).

a choice of $\{a_n\}$ so that $P(X_t\to \infty)\ge \sigma$. Our result does not
apply when $\sigma=1$, the original conjecture remains open. We record our

expected occupancy in post-surgery recovery spaces. Simulated Annealing
produces good solutions in short amounts of computational time. We evaluate the

dynamics (such as longitudinal dynamics) as inputs, which, unfortunately, are
obscure to calibrate in real time. As a result, to achieve reasonable
performance, most, if not all, research-oriented autonomous vehicles do manual
calibrations in a one-by-one fashion. Since manual calibration is not
sustainable once entering into mass production stage for industrial purposes,
we here introduce a machine-learning based auto-calibration system for
autonomous driving vehicles. In this paper, we will show how we build a
data-driven longitudinal calibration procedure using machine learning
techniques. We first generated offline calibration tables from human driving
data. The offline table serves as an initial guess for later uses and it only
needs twenty-minutes data collection and process. We then used an
online-learning algorithm to appropriately update the initial table (the
offline table) based on real-time performance analysis. This longitudinal
auto-calibration system has been deployed to more than one hundred Baidu Apollo
self-driving vehicles (including hybrid family vehicles and electronic
delivery-only vehicles) since April 2018. By August 27, 2018, it had been
tested for more than two thousands hours, ten thousands kilometers (6,213

singular Fermi-liquid, but it is altered on entering a superconducting state in

and in general is analytic. The single-particle excitations in the
superconducting states are then quasi-particles so that a form of Landau theory
may be constructed for thermodynamic and transport properties in the
superconducting state. In this theory, the renormalization of measurable
properties due to quasi-particle interactions, such as specific heat,
compressibility, magnetic susceptibility, superfluid density, etc. changes in a
temperature dependent fashion from the non-interacting theory. This is
illustrated by showing the renormalization of these quantities and the relation
between the parameters introduced to account for their temperature dependence.
When the renormalizations in the normal state are large or singular,
temperature dependence of properties in the superconducting states are then in
general not useful for identifying the nodal character or symmetry of the
superconducting state except for measurements at very low temperatures, upper
limits of which are specified. The results obtained are expected to be useful

restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium. Such a hadronic scale
interaction for the $\eta^{\prime}$ mesonic nuclei may provide modification of
the nuclear structure. The relativistic mean field theory is a self-contained
model for finite nuclei which provides the saturation property within the
model, and is good to investigate the structure change of the nucleus induced
by the $\eta^{\prime}$ meson. Using the local density approximation for the
mean fields, we solve the equations of motion for the nucleons and the
$\eta^{\prime}$ meson self-consistently, and obtain the nuclear density
distribution and the $\eta^{\prime}$ energy spectrum for the $\eta^{\prime}$
mesonic nuclei. We take $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca for the target nuclei.
We find several bound states of the $\eta^{\prime}$ meson for these nuclei

sufficient change of the nuclear structure especially for the $1s$ bound state

Measured thicknesses are found to be much smaller than the previous
experimental measurements close to the bulk melting temperature. We find that

revealed by scanning the surface at $\mu$m level resolution, and can contribute

great deal of attention over the years as a promising cathode material for
large scale lithium ion batteries. Here a facile hydrothermal route followed by
solid state reaction is developed using as grown ultrafine alpha-MnO2 nanorods
to prepare one dimensional LiMn2O4 with 10-50nm diameters. To enhance the
cathodic property of these nanorods, a unique synthesis technique of heat
treatment is developed to grow 2D graphene oxide sheet enveloping 1D LiMn2O4 as
interconnected framework. This nanocomposite 3D porous cathode exhibits a high
specific charge capacity of 130mAh/g at 0.05C rate and Coulombic efficiency of
about 98% after 100 cycles in the potential window of 3.5 to 4.3V versus Li/Li+
with promising initial charge capacity retention of about 87%, and outstanding
structural stability even after 100 cycles. Enhancement in the lithiation and
delithiation processes leading to improved performance is likely to have its
origin in the 2D conducting graphene oxide sheets. It allows for decreasing the
Mn dissolution, improve the electron conductivity and reduce the Li-ion path
diffusion inside the favourable morphology and crystallinity of the ultrafine
1D LiMn2O4 nanorods, giving rise to a promising cathode nanocomposite.

magnitude of the susceptibility-induced magnetic field. Conclusion: While the
effect of myelin in brain white matter is commonly treated assuming efficient
diffusion narrowing, this regime does not hold for larger cells or higher

characterization of the flow field. Two spatial networks corresponding to the
streamwise and wall-normal velocity components are built, where nodes represent
portions of volume of the physical domain. For each network, links are active
if the correlation coefficient of the corresponding velocity component between
pairs of nodes is sufficiently high, thus unveiling the strongest kinematic
relations. Several network measures are studied in order to explore the
interrelations between nodes and their neighbors. Specifically, long-range
links are localized between near-wall regions and associated with the temporal
persistence of coherent patterns, namely high and low speed streaks.
Furthermore, long-range links play a crucial role as intermediary for the
kinematic information flow, as emerges from the analysis of indirect
connections between nodes. The proposed approach provides a framework to
investigate spatial structures of the turbulent dynamics, showing the full
potential of complex networks. Although the network analysis is based on the
two-point correlation, it is able to advance the level of information, by
exploiting the texture created by active links in all directions. Based on the
observed findings, the current approach can pave the way for an enhanced
spatial interpretation of the turbulence dynamics.

the logic and methodology of the Bayes-Laplace approach to inductive
statistical inference that places common sense and the guiding lines of the
scientific method at the heart of systematic analyses of quantitative-empirical
data. Following an exposition of exactly solvable cases of single- and
two-parameter estimation problems, the main focus is laid on Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) simulations on the basis of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of
posterior joint probability distributions for regression parameters occurring
in generalised linear models for a univariate outcome variable. The modelling
of fixed effects as well as of correlated varying effects via multi-level
models in non-centred parametrisation is considered. The simulation of
posterior predictive distributions is outlined. The assessment of a model's
relative out-of-sample posterior predictive accuracy with information
entropy-based criteria WAIC and LOOIC and model comparison with Bayes factors
are addressed. A brief discussion on the description of the generation of
stationary time series data by means of autoregressive models is contained.
Concluding, a conceptual link to the behavioural subjective expected utility

decision problems is established. Vectorised codes for MCMC simulations of

However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation

probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a
range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape

view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to
enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the
true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the
observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate
the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture
these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze

pressure $p$ below the classical critical buckling pressure $p_c$, indentation
by a point force does not lead to spontaneous buckling but an energy barrier
has to be overcome. The states at the maximum of the energy barrier represent a
subcritical branch of unstable stationary points, which are the transition
states to a snap-through buckled state. Starting from nonlinear shallow shell
theory we obtain a closed analytical expression for the energy barrier height,
which facilitates its effective numerical evaluation as a function of pressure
by continuation techniques. We find a clear crossover between two regimes: For
$p/p_c\ll 1$ the post-buckling barrier state is a mirror-inverted Pogorelov
dimple, and for $(1-p/p_c)\ll 1$ the barrier state is a shallow dimple with
indentations smaller than shell thickness and exhibits extended oscillations,

the nonlinear shallow shell equations about the Pogorelov mirror-inverted
dimple for $p/p_c\ll 1$ and the linear response state for $(1-p/p_c)\ll 1$,

landscape in both regimes. Upon approaching the buckling bifurcation at $p_c$
from below, we find a softening of an ideal spherical shell. The stiffness for
the linear response to point forces vanishes $\propto (1-p/p_c)^{1/2}$; the
buckling energy barrier vanishes $\propto (1-p/p_c)^{3/2}$. In the Pogorelov
limit, the energy barrier maximum diverges $\propto (p/p_c)^{-3}$ and the

against different setups, to address how it affects the formation/dissociation
of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). First, we explore very idealised conditions, to
show that it can accurately reproduce the terminal momentum of the blast-wave
independent of resolution. Then, we apply it to a suite of numerical
simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy and compare it with a similar
run employing the delayed-cooling sub-grid prescription. We find that the
delayed-cooling model, by pressurising ad-hoc the gas, is more effective in
suppressing star formation. However, to get this effect, it must maintain the
gas warm/hot at densities where it is expected to cool efficiently,
artificially changing the thermo-chemical state of the gas, and reducing the
H$_2$ abundance even in dense gas. Mechanical feedback, on the other hand, is
able to reproduce the H$_2$ column densities without altering the gas
thermodynamics, and, at the same time, drives more powerful outflows. However,
being less effective in suppressing star formation, it over-predicts the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation by a factor of about 2.5. Finally, we show that the
model is consistent at different resolution levels, with only mild differences.

investigate if the information in 3T spectra can be extracted by a deep
learning approach trained by 9.4T human brain target data. Methods:
Highly-spectrally-resolved Z-spectra from the same volunteer were acquired by
3D-snapshot CEST MRI at 3 T and 9.4 T with similar saturation schemes. The
volume-registered 3 T Z-spectra-stack was then used as input data for a 3-layer
deep neural network with the volume-registered 9.4 T fitted parameter stack as
target data. The neural network was optimized and applied to training data, to
unseen data from a different volunteer, and as well to a tumor patient data
set. Results: A useful neural net architecture could be found and verified in
healthy volunteers. The principle gray-/white matter contrast of the different
CEST effects was predicted with only small deviations. The 9.4 T prediction was
less noisy compared to the directly measured CEST maps, however at the cost of
slightly lower tissue contrast. Application to a tumor patient measured at 3 T
and 9.4 T revealed that tumorous tissue Z-spectra and corresponding
hyper/hypo-intensities of different CEST effects can also be predicted.
Conclusion: Deep learning might be a powerful tool for CEST data processing and
deepCEST could bring the benefits and insights of the few ultra-high field
sites to a broader clinical use. Vice versa deepCEST might help for determining
which subjects are good candidates to measure additionally at UHF.

family of functions for which $salt(f)$ is $2^{\Omega(s(f))}$. We show an
affine transform $A$, such that the corresponding function $g$ satisfies
$bs(f,0^n) \le s(g)$, using which we proving that for $F(x,y)=f(x\land y)$, the
bounded error quantum communication complexity of $F$ with prior entanglement,
$Q^*_{1/3}(F)=\Omega(\sqrt{bs(f,0^n)})$. Our proof builds on ideas from
Sherstov (2010) where we use specific properties of the above affine
transformation. We show,
  * For a prime $p$ and $0<\epsilon<1$, any $f$ with
$deg_p(f)\le(1-\epsilon)\log n$ must satisfy $Q^*_{1/3}(F) =
\Omega(\frac{n^{\epsilon/2}}{\log n})$. Here, $deg_p(f)$ denotes the degree of
the multilinear polynomial of $f$ over $\F_p$.
  * For any $f$ such that there exists primes $p$ and $q$ with $deg_q(f) \ge
\Omega(deg_p(f)^\delta)$ for $\delta > 2$, the deterministic communication
complexity - $D(F)$ and $Q^*_{1/3}(F)$ are polynomially related. In particular,
this holds when $deg_p(f) = O(1)$. Thus, for this class of functions, this
answers an open question (see Buhrman and deWolf (2001)) about the relation
between the two measures.
  We construct linear transformation $A$, such that $g$ satisfies, $alt(f) \le
2s(g)+1$. Using this, we exhibit a family of Boolean functions that rule out a
potential approach to settle the XOR Log-Rank conjecture via a proof of
Sensitivity conjecture [Hao Huang (2019)].

such as BLEU, NIST, etc, for evaluating the performance of NLG systems.
However, these metrics continue to remain popular and are recently being used
for evaluating the performance of systems which automatically generate
questions from documents, knowledge graphs, images, etc. Given the rising
interest in such automatic question generation (AQG) systems, it is important
to objectively examine whether these metrics are suitable for this task. In
particular, it is important to verify whether such metrics used for evaluating
AQG systems focus on answerability of the generated question by preferring
questions which contain all relevant information such as question type
(Wh-types), entities, relations, etc. In this work, we show that current
automatic evaluation metrics based on $n$-gram similarity do not always
correlate well with human judgments about answerability of a question. To
alleviate this problem and as a first step towards better evaluation metrics
for AQG, we introduce a scoring function to capture answerability and show that
when this scoring function is integrated with existing metrics, they correlate
significantly better with human judgments. The scripts and data developed as a

neutrinoless double beta decay. Their operation requires particular strategies

waveguiding by means of artificial gauge fields. To this end, we construct
artificial gauge fields in a photonic waveguide array, by using waveguides with
nontrivial trajectories. First, we show that tilting the waveguide arrays gives
rise to gauge fields that are different in the core and the cladding, shifting
their respective dispersion curves, and in turn confining the light to the
core. In a more advanced setting, we demonstrate waveguiding in a medium with
the same artificial gauge field and the same dispersion everywhere, but with a

instability (TI) and focus on non-modal (transient) growth rather than the
tearing mode. With the help of pseudospectral theory, the operators of the
linear equations are shown to be highly non-normal, resulting in the
possibility of significant transient growth at the onset of the TI. This
possibility increases as the Lundquist number $S$ increases. In particular, we
find evidence, numerically, that the maximum possible transient growth,
measured in the $L_2$-norm, for the classical setup of current sheets unstable
to the TI, scales as $O(S^{1/4})$ on time scales of $O(S^{1/4})$ for $S\gg 1$.
This behaviour is much faster than the time scale $O(S^{1/2})$ when the
solution behaviour is dominated by the tearing mode. The size of transient
growth obtained is dependent on the form of the initial perturbation. Optimal
initial conditions for the maximum possible transient growth are determined,
which take the form of wave packets and can be thought of as noise concentrated
at the current sheet. We also examine how the structure of the eigenvalue

gain, receiver sensitivity, blockage parameter and pathloss exponents. Our
model takes account of the maximum power limitation and the per-user power
control. More specifically, each user, which could be in line-of-sight (LOS) or
non-LOS to its serving mmWave BS, controls its transmit power such that the
received signal power at its serving BS is equal to a predefined threshold.
Hence, a truncated channel inversion power control scheme is implemented for
the uplink of mmWave cellular networks. We derive closed-form expressions for
the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) outage probability for the
uplink of both the single and multi-tier mmWave cellular networks. Furthermore,
we analyze the case with a dense network by utilizing the simplified model,
where the LOS region is approximated as a fixed LOS disc. The results show that
imposing a maximum power constraint on the user significantly affects the SINR
outage probability in the uplink of mmWave cellular networks.

construct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a

wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission
to an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for
distributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording,

transaction fee incurred from blockchain's distributed ledger services,
rational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize
individual utility. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze
this competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical

they do not possess rotational symmetry, they cannot describe the discretized
rotational bands in absorption and emission spectra that have been found
experimentally. Here, to address this problem, we introduce a rotationally
invariant system-bath (RISB) model that is described by two sets of
harmonic-oscillator baths independently coupled to the rigid rotator as sine
and cosine functions of the rotator angle. Due to a difference in the energy
discretization of the total Hamiltonian, the dynamics described by the RISB
model differ significantly from those described by the rotational
Caldeira-Legget (RCL) model, while both models reduce to the Langevin equation
for a rotator in the classical limit. To demonstrate this point, we compute the
rotational absorption spectrum defined by the linear response function of a
rotator dipole. For this purpose, we derive a quantum master equation for the
RISB model in the high-temperature Markovian case. We find that the spectral
profiles of the calculated signals exhibit a transition from quantized
rotational bands to a single peak after spectrum collapse. This is a
significant finding, because previous approaches cannot describe such phenomena

present a one-dimensional model for the formation of a protoplanetary disk from
a molecular cloud core and its subsequent long-term evolution within a single

simulations due to the limitation of computational power. In our model, we
calculate the time evolution of the surface density of the gas and the dust
with the wind mass loss and the radial drift of the dust in the disk. We find
that the MHD disk wind is a viable mechanism for the formation of ring-hole
structure in young disks. We perform a parameter study of our model and derive
condition of the formation of ring-hole structures within $6\times10^5$ years
after the start of the collapse of the molecular cloud core. The final outcome
of the disk shows five types of morphology and this can be understood by
comparing the timescale of the viscous diffusion, the mass loss by MHD disk
wind and the radial drift of the dust. We discuss the implication of the model

form factors is performed within a reconstruction method, based on the
identification of the transverse traceless components $(A_i)$ of the same
correlator. The solutions of the primary CWI' s are found by exploiting the
universality of the Fuchsian indices of the conformal operators and a
re-arrangement of the corresponding inhomogenous hypergeometric systems. We
confirm the number of constants in the solution of the primary CWI's of
previous analysis. In our comparison with perturbation theory, we discuss
scalar, fermion and spin 1 exchanges at 1-loop in dimensional regularization.
Explicit checks in $d=3$ and $d=5$ prove the consistency of this

field theory sectors available in d=4, the general solutions of the conformal
constraints is expressed just in terms of ordinary scalar 2- and 3-point
functions $(B_0,C_0)$. We show how the renormalized $d=4$ TTT vertex separates
naturally into the sum of a traceless and an anomaly part, the latter
determined by the anomaly functional and generated by the renormalization of
the correlator in dimensional regularization. The result confirms the emergence
of anomaly poles and effective massless exchanges as a specific signature of
conformal anomalies in momentum space, directly connected to the
renormalization of the corresponding gravitational vertices, generalizing the

environment have been shown to obey a general duality relation [Phys. Rev. B
93, 81411 (2016)] which allows for a drastic simplification of time-evolution
calculations. In the weak-coupling limit, such a system can be associated with
a unique dual physical system in which all energies are inverted, in particular
the internal interaction. This paper generalizes this fermionic duality in two
ways: we allow for weak coupling with arbitrary energy dependence and describe
both occupations and coherences coupled by a quantum master equation for the
density operator. We also show that whenever generalized detailed balance holds
(Kolmogorov criterion), the stationary probabilities for the dual system can be
expressed explicitly in terms of the stationary recurrence times of the
original system, even at large bias.
  We illustrate the generalized duality by a detailed analysis of the rate
equation for a quantum dot with strong onsite Coulomb repulsion, going beyond
the commonly assumed wideband limit. We present predictions for (i) the decay
rates for transient charge and heat currents after a gate-voltage quench and
(ii) the thermoelectric linear response coefficients in the stationary limit.
We show that even for pronouncedly energy-dependent coupling, all nontrivial
parameter dependence in these problems is entirely captured by just two
well-understood stationary variables, the average charge of the system and of
the dual system. Remarkably, it is the latter that often dictates the most
striking features of the measurable quantities (e.g., positions of resonances),
underscoring the importance of the dual system for understanding the actual

their identity remains unknown. The sight line to the young massive
star-forming region M17 shows anomalous extinction in the sense that the
total-to-selective extinction parameter differs significantly from the average
Galactic value and may reach values $R_{V} > 4$. Given the high $R_V$ values,
we investigate whether the DIBs in sight lines towards young OB stars in M17
show a peculiar behaviour. We measure the properties of the most prominent DIBs
in M17 and study these as a function of $E(B-V)$ and $R_{V}$. The DIB strengths
in M17 concur with the observed relations between DIB equivalent width and
reddening $E(B-V)$ in Galactic sight lines. For several DIBs we discover a
linear relation between the normalised DIB strength EW/$A_{V}$ and
$R_{V}^{-1}$. These trends suggest two groups: (i) a group of ten moderately
strong DIBs that show a sensitivity to changes in $R_{V}$ that is modest and
proportional to DIB strength, and (ii) a group of four very strong DIBs that
react sensitively and to a similar degree to changes in $R_{V}$, but in a way
that does not appear to depend on DIB strength. The DIB behaviour as a function
of reddening is not peculiar in sight lines to M17. Also, we do not detect
anomalous DIB profiles as seen in Her 36. DIBs are stronger, per unit visual
extinction, in sight lines characterised by a smaller value of $R_{V}$ (large
fraction of small dust particles). New relations between extinction normalised
DIB strengths, EW/$A_V$, and $R_V$ support the idea that DIB carriers and
interstellar dust are connected. Given the distinct behaviour of two groups of
DIBs, different types of carriers do not necessarily relate to the dust grains
in a similar way.

aims to supersede all previously known shape theories for metrizable spaces.
  The problem with known shape theories of metrizable spaces is illustrated by
the following bizarre situation. \v{C}ech cohomology is an invariant of shape,
and a fortiori of strong shape. But Steenrod-Sitnikov homology is not shape
invariant (already for compacta) and has not been proved to be strong shape
invariant (in more than 40 years). Worse yet, there is an ordinary homology
theory that is strong shape invariant by design, but it cannot be computed in
ZFC for simplest non-compact non-ANRs (such as the disjoint union of countably
many copies of the one-point compactification of the countable discrete space).
On the other hand, Steenrod-Sitnikov homology is an invariant of antishape
(=compactly generated strong shape), and a fortiori of strong antishape.
However, \v{C}ech cohomology is not antishape invariant (already for ANRs) and
has not been proved to be strong antishape invariant. And there is an ordinary
cohomology theory that is strong antishape invariant by design, but it cannot
be computed in ZFC for simplest non-compact non-ANRs.
  Even though strong shape and strong antishape differ from each other by
exchanging direct and inverse limits, we show that their natural ""corrections""
(taking into account a topology on the indexing sets) coincide for all
metrizable spaces. This common ""correction"", called fine shape, is much simpler
than the original theories and has both \v{C}ech cohomology and
Steenrod-Sitnikov homology as its invariants. For ANRs fine shape coincides
with homotopy, for compacta with strong shape, and for locally compact
separable metrizable spaces - with strong antishape.
  We prove that a (co)homology theory is fine shape invariant if and only if it

pairing strength, obtaining regimes with extended, critical and localized bulk
states, if the driving is performed at high frequencies. In these, we
characterize wave-packet propagation, obtaining ballistic, subdiffusive and

an additional region in the phase diagram with a mobility edge between critical

under time-aperiodicity on the drivings, observing that the system eventually
thermalizes: It results in featureless random states which can be described by
the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. In a system with open edges, we find that both
Majorana and fermionic localized edge modes can be engineered with a spatially
quasiperiodic potential. Besides, we demonstrate the possibility of creating
multiple Majorana $0$ and $\pi$ modes in a driven setting, even if the

robustness of the Majorana modes against the aperiodicity in the driving

Thus, update modes do not allow a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of
biological systems, as they may lead to reject valid BN models.This technical
report lists the main definitions and properties of the most permissive
semantics of BNs introduced in http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.998377.
This semantics meets with a correct abstraction of any multivalued refinements,
with any update mode. It subsumes all the usual updating modes, while enabling
new behaviors achievable by more concrete models. Moreover, it appears that
classical dynamical analyzes of reachability and attractors have a simpler
computational complexity:- reachability can be assessed in a polynomial number
of iterations. The computation of iterations is in NP in the very general case,
and is linear when local functions are monotonic, or with some usual
representations of functions of BNs (binary decision diagrams, Petri nets,
automata networks, etc.). Thus, reachability is in P with locally-monotonic
BNs, and P$^{\text{NP}}$ otherwise (instead of being PSPACE-complete with
update modes);- deciding wherever a configuration belongs to an attractor is in
coNP with locally-monotonic BNs, and coNP$^{\text{coNP}}$ otherwise (instead of
PSPACE-complete with update modes).Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
semantics completely captures any behavior achievable with any multilevel or
ODE refinement of the BN; and the semantics is minimal with respect to this
model refinement criteria: to any most permissive trajectory, there exists a
multilevel refinement of the BN which can reproduce it.In brief, the most
permissive semantics of BNs enables a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of
BNs, with a greater tractability than previously introduced update modes.

fully adjustable robust feasibility problems with an empty first stage. This is
equivalent to deciding whether the uncertainty set is contained within the
projection of the feasible region onto the uncertainty-space. Moreover, the
considered sets are assumed to be described by polynomials. For answering this
question, two very general approaches using methods from polynomial
optimization are presented - one for showing feasibility and one for showing
infeasibility. The developed methods are approximated through sum of squares
polynomials and solved using semidefinite programs. Deciding robust feasibility
and infeasibility is important for gas network operations, which is a nonconvex
feasibility problem where the feasible set is described by a composition of
polynomials with the absolute value function. Concerning the gas network
problem, different topologies are considered. It is shown that a tree
structured network can be decided exactly using linear programming.
Furthermore, a method is presented to reduce a tree network with one additional
arc to a single cycle network. In this case, the problem can be decided by
eliminating the absolute value functions and solving the resulting linearly
many polynomial optimization problems. Lastly, the effectivity of the methods
is tested on a variety of small cyclic networks. It turns out that for
instances where robust feasibility or infeasibility can be decided
successfully, level 2 or level 3 of the Lasserre relaxation hierarchy typically
is sufficient.

macroscopic equations which consider microstructure evolution indirectly or
simply discard microstructure information. Modern materials science, on the
other hand, seeks quantitive descriptions for the relations between
microstrucutre and loading response. In the present work, we show a promising
mesoscale phase-field framework which can describe co-evolution of phase/grain
and defect microstructures, reveal microstructure mechanisms and simultaneously
predict deformation properties as a natural outcome of microstrucuture
interactions. The energy functionals for phase/grain and defect microstructures
are constructed, followed by functional variation which leads to governing
equations. Applying the developed framework to high temperature cyclic loading
of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys, the simulated results show that
cyclic loading-microstructure-property relations can be principally revealed.

experiments. The plastic strains are one order of magnitude smaller than total
strains, which explains why the cyclic loops are very ""thin"". In the long term

similar to creep under zero cyclic loading ratio, with the extent of rafting
slight dependent on cyclic waveform, period, etc. The plastic strains are
sensitive to cyclic loading conditions both in terms of curve shape and in

'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, the first dialogue of a trilogy
including the Sophist and the Statesman. In the present article, we study an
important point in more detail, the 'definition' of 'powers'
('$\delta\upsilon\nu\acute\alpha\mu\epsilon\iota\varsigma$'). While in
[Brisson-Ofman2], it was shown that the different steps to get the definition
are mathematically and philosophically incorrect, it is explained why the
definition itself is problematic. However, it is the first example, at least in
the trilogy, of a definition by division. This point is generally ignored by
modern commentators though, as we will try to show, it gives rise, in a
mathematical context, to at least three fundamental questions: the meaning(s)
of 'logos', the connection between 'elements and compound' and, of course the
question of the 'power(s)'. One of the main consequences of our works on
Theaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge
the so-called 'main standard interpretation'. In particular, following
[Ofman2014], we question the claim that Plato praises and glorifies both the
mathematician Theodorus and the young Theaetetus. According to our analysis,
such a claim, considered as self-evident, entails many errors. Conversely, our
analysis of Theaetetus' mathematical mistakes highlights the main cause of some
generally overlooked failures in the dialogue: the forgetting of the 'logos',
first in the 'mathematical part', then in the following discussion, and finally
the failure of the four successive tries of its definition at the end of the
dialogue. Namely, as we will show, the passage is closely connected with the
problems studied at the end of the dialogue, but also to the two other parts of
the trilogy through the method of 'definition by division'. Finally, if our
conclusions are different from the usual ones, it is probably because the
passage is analyzed, maybe for the first time, simultaneously from the
philosophical, historical and mathematical points of view. It had been
considered usually either as an excursus by historians of philosophy (for
instance [Burnyeat1978]), or as an isolated text separated from the rest of the
dialogue by historians of mathematics (for instance [Knorr1975]), or lastly as
a pretext to discuss some astute developments in modern mathematics by
mathematicians (for instance [Kahane1985]).[Brisson-Ofman1]: Luc

Hence, we look for a polynomial decay rate for smooth initial data. Using

the optimized tetradymite topological insulators Bi2Te2Se (BTS) and
Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS). The superconducting phases emerge at structural phase
transitions, the first at 8.4 GPa for BTS and 12.4 GPa for BSTS, and the second
at 13.6 GPa for BTS and 20.4 GPa, for BSTS. Electronic structure calculations
show that these phases do not have topological character. Comparison of our
results with prior work on Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and (Bi,Sb)2(Se,Te)3 allows us to
uncover a universal phase diagram for pressure-induced superconductivity in
tetradymites, providing a basis for understanding the relationships between
topological behavior, crystal structure, and superconductivity for these
materials.

from one to multiple dimensions. A system is self-stabilizing if it can recover
to a legitimate state from any initial illegal state. These kind of systems are
most often used in distributed applications. Monotonic searchability provides
guarantees when searching for nodes while the recovery process is going on.
More precisely, if a search request started at some node $u$ succeeds in
reaching its destination $v$, then all future search requests from $u$ to $v$
succeed as well. Although there already exists a self-stabilizing protocol for
a two-dimensional topology and an universal approach for monotonic
searchability, it is not clear how both of these concepts fit together
effectively. The latter concept even comes with some restrictive assumptions on
messages, which is not the case for our protocol. We propose a simple novel
protocol for a self-stabilizing two-dimensional quadtree that satisfies
monotonic searchability. Our protocol can easily be extended to higher
dimensions and offers routing in $\mathcal O(\log n)$ hops for any search

recently reported for some reentrant spin glass-like compounds. In this work,
the time-evolution of magnetization is thoroughly investigated for two ZEB

on such effect. La$_{1.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoMnO$_{6}$ and
La$_{1.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoMnO$_{6}$ were chosen as representative samples of ZEB

while the second has a much smaller effect, despite being
structurally/chemically similar. Comprehensive magnetic measurements were
carried on both samples, and the results are discussed in terms of the amount
and time-evolution of the spin glass-like phase under the influence of a
varying field. We also propose a phenomenological model, based on the pinning
of spin glass-like moments and on the dynamics of their magnetic relaxation, to
explain the asymmetry observed in the hysteresis loops. The good agreement
between the simulated and experimental results confirms our hypothesis that the

compute the time ordered 2-pt functions of scalar CFT operators via a
non-back-reacting Klein-Gordon field for both backgrounds and confront the

popularity, however, may attract attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities of
the deployed deep learning models and launch attacks against security-sensitive

attack, which we refer to as a {\em backdoor injection attack}. The main goal
of the adversary performing such attack is to generate and inject a backdoor
into a deep learning model that can be triggered to recognize certain embedded
patterns with a target label of the attacker's choice. Additionally, a backdoor
injection attack should occur in a stealthy manner, without undermining the
efficacy of the victim model. Specifically, we propose two approaches for
generating a backdoor that is hardly perceptible yet effective in poisoning the
model. We consider two attack settings, with backdoor injection carried out
either before model training or during model updating. We carry out extensive
experimental evaluations under various assumptions on the adversary model, and
demonstrate that such attacks can be effective and achieve a high attack
success rate (above $90\%$) at a small cost of model accuracy loss (below
$1\%$) with a small injection rate (around $1\%$), even under the weakest
assumption wherein the adversary has no knowledge either of the original

property to address in combination with safety. Over the years, researchers
have proposed approaches to harmonize activities within the safety and security
disciplines. Despite the academic efforts to identify interdependencies and to
propose combined approaches for safety and security, there is still a lack of
integration between safety and security practices in the industrial context, as
they have separate standards and independent processes often addressed and
assessed by different organizational teams and authorities. Specifically,
security concerns are generally not covered in any detail in safety standards
potentially resulting in successfully safety-certified systems that still are
open for security threats from e.g., malicious intents from internal and
external personnel and hackers that may jeopardize safety. In recent years
security has again received an increasing attention of being an important issue
also in safety assurance, as the open interconnected nature of emerging systems
makes them susceptible to security threats at a much higher degree than
existing more confined products.This article presents initial ideas on how to
extend safety work to include aspects of security during the context
establishment and initial risk assessment procedures. The ambition of our
proposal is to improve safety and increase efficiency and effectiveness of the
safety work within the frames of the current safety standards, i.e., raised
security awareness in compliance with the current safety standards. We believe
that our proposal is useful to raise the security awareness in industrial
contexts, although it is not a complete harmonization of safety and security
disciplines, as it merely provides applicable guidance to increase security
awareness in a safety context.

sublinear (in the dynamically changing number of edges) amortized update time.
In this paper we significantly improve the update time for uniformly sparse
graphs. Specifically, for graphs with arboricity $\alpha$, the amortized update
time of our algorithm is $O(\alpha^2 \cdot \log^2 n)$, where $n$ is the number
of vertices. For low arboricity graphs, which include, for example, minor-free
graphs as well as some classes of `real world' graphs, our update time is
polylogarithmic. Our update time improves the result of Assadi et al. for all
graphs with arboricity bounded by $m^{3/8 - \epsilon}$, for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$. This covers much of the range of possible values for
arboricity, as the arboricity of a general graph cannot exceed $m^{1/2}$.

regularly in one line inside the microgroove in a 3D microchannel. We used
computational fluid dynamics to analyze the fluid recirculation area inside
different microgrooves. The height of recirculation area in the bottom of
microgroove can affect the cell attachment, and also materials delivery to
attached cells, so the height of recirculation area has to be optimum amount.
In addition, we analyzed the fluid drag force on cell movement toward the
microgroove. This parameter was proportional to the fluid velocities in x and y
directions changing in different microgrooves geometries. In different
microgrooves geometries the fluid velocity in y direction does not change. If
the fluid velocity in x direction decreases inside the microgroove, the cell
movement time inside the microgroove will increase, and also the drag force in
y direction can push the cells toward the bottom due to the lower drag force in
x direction. The percentages of negative shear stress and average shear stress
on the adhered cell surface were also calculated. The lower average shear
stress, and negative shear stress around 50% on the cell surface are against
cell detachment from the substrate. The results indicated that at the constant
fluid inlet velocity and microchannel height, microgroove geometry and ratio of
cell size to the microgroove size play pivotal roles in the cell initial
adhesion to the substrate as well as the cell detachment.

described mathematically by a completely positive map. However, experimentally
reconstructed processes are not necessarily completely positive due to
statistical or systematic errors. In this paper, we introduce a test for
discriminating statistical from systematic errors which is necessary to
interpret experimentally reconstructed, non-completely positive
maps.Wedemonstrate the significance of the test using several examples given by
experiments and simulations. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally how
an initial correlation between the system to be measured and its environment
leads to an experimentally reconstructed map with negative eigenvalues. These
experiments are carried out using atomic 171Yb+ ions confined in a linear Paul
trap, addressed and coherently manipulated by radio frequency radiation.

significant radiation friction losses, in contrast to thin targets for which
such losses are negligible. We present an analytical calculation, based on
classical radiation friction modeling, of the conversion efficiency of the
laser energy into incoherent radiation in the case when a circularly polarized
pulse interacts with a thick plasma slab of overcritical initial density. By
accounting for three effects including the influence of radiation losses on the
single electron trajectory, the global `hole boring' motion of the laser-plasma
interaction region under the action of radiation pressure, and the
inhomogeneity of the laser field in both longitudinal and transverse direction,
we find a good agreement with the results of three-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations. Overall, the collective effects greatly reduce radiation losses
with respect to electrons driven by the same laser pulse in vacuum, which also
shift the reliability of classical calculations up to higher intensities.

embedded in a polymer network. Their shape and elasticity can be controlled by
an external magnetic field, which gives rise to both, engineering and
biomedical applications. Computer simulations are a commonly used tool to study
these materials. A well-known bottleneck of these simulations is the demanding
calculation of dipolar interactions. Under periodic boundary conditions
established algorithms are available for doing this, however, at the expense of
restricting the way in which the gels can deform in an external magnetic field.
Moreover, the magnetic properties depend on the sample shape, ruling out
periodic boundary conditions entirely for some research questions. In this
article we will employ the recently developed dipolar variant of the P$^2$NFFT
method that is able to calculate dipolar interactions under open boundary
conditions with an $N \log N$ scaling in the number of particles, rather than
the expensive $N^2$ scaling of a direct summation of pair forces. The dipolar
P$^2$NFFT method has been implemented within the ScaFaCoS library. The
molecular dynamics software ESPResSo has been extended to make use of the
library.
  After a short summary of the method, we will discuss its value for studying
magnetic soft matter systems. A particular focus is put on developing a tuning
strategy to reach the best performance of the method at a predefined accuracy,
and lastly applying the method to a magnetic gel model. Here, adapting to the
gel's change in shape during the course of a simulation is of particular
interest.

Vertical Shear Instability (VSI), the Convective OverStability (COS), and the
amplification of vortices via the Subcritical Baroclinic Instability (SBI). We
use steady state accretion disk models, including stellar irradiation,
accretion heating and radiative transfer. We determine the local radial and
vertical stratification and thermal relaxation rate in the disk, in dependence
of the stellar mass, disk mass and mass accretion rate. We find that passive
regions of disks - i.e. the midplane temperature dominated by irradiation - are
COS unstable about one pressure scale height above the midplane and VSI
unstable at radii $> 10 \, \text{au}$. Vortex amplification via SBI should
operate in most parts of active and passive disks. For active parts of disks
(midplane temperature determined by accretion power) COS can become active down
to the midplane. Same is true for the VSI because of the vertically adiabatic
stratification of an internally heated disk. If hydro instabilities or other
non-ideal MHD processes are able to create $\alpha$-stresses ($> 10^{-5}$) and
released accretion energy leads to internal heating of the disk, hydrodynamical
instabilities are likely to operate in significant parts of the planet forming
zones in disks around young stars, driving gas accretion and flow structure
formation. Thus hydro-instabilities are viable candidates to explain the rings
and vortices observed with ALMA and VLT.

reduced-size demonstration cluster named ""Dubna"". The first cluster in its
baseline configuration was deployed in 2016, the second in 2017 and the third
in 2018. The full scale GVD will be an array of ~10000 light sensors with an
instrumented volume of about 2 cubic km. The first phase (GVD-1) is planned to
be completed by 2020-2021. It will comprise 8 clusters with 2304 light sensors

realistically looking synthetic images with remarkable success, yet their
performance seems less impressive when the training set is highly diverse. In
order to provide a better fit to the target data distribution when the dataset
includes many different classes, we propose a variant of the basic GAN model,
called Gaussian Mixture GAN (GM-GAN), where the probability distribution over
the latent space is a mixture of Gaussians. We also propose a supervised
variant which is capable of conditional sample synthesis. In order to evaluate
the model's performance, we propose a new scoring method which separately takes
into account two (typically conflicting) measures - diversity vs. quality of
the generated data. Through a series of empirical experiments, using both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs
outperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception
Score, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method. In
addition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the \textit{unsupervised} variant of
GM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the
latent space to samples of different classes in the data space. We show how
this phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and
provide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the
unsupervised clustering of image datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a feature
which further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control
the quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability
distribution of the latent space. This allows one to sample higher quality and
lower diversity samples, or vice versa, according to one's needs.

almost athermally or very fast diffusing species such as self-interstitial atom
(SIA) clusters currently relies on mean-field or coarse-graining techniques.
Rate-equation cluster dynamics (RECD) is the most popular of those when dealing
with irradiated microstructure or second phase precipitation. The important
input parameters of RECD are the absorption rates, also called cluster
sink-strengths (CSS). These quantities crucially depend on the way clusters
interact and diffuse and notably on the dimensionality of the involved random
diffusion processes. As expected theoretically and experimentally confirmed,
SIA clusters migrate in a one-dimensional fashion (possibly with random
orientation changes). This complicates the calculation of the related CSS. When
involving a 1D-mobile specie and an immobile reaction partner (a ""1D-0""
reaction) the expressions are quite well known as well as the extension
including random rotations (a ""1DR-0"" reaction). Expressions of CSS for
absorptions between identical 1D-mobile species were proposed in the
literature, but the general case of 1D-1D absorptions between different cluster
classes is unknown. Here we propose such general expressions which turn out to
depend on capture radii of interacting clusters populations, concentrations and
notably on the ratio of their respective diffusion coefficients through a
power-law. The same power-law formulation is found for 1D-3D absorptions but
with different exponents, which thus appear as signatures of the dimensionality
of the involved random motions. These limiting cases of CSS being established,
they are finally implemented in an RECD calculation. The comparison with time
consuming kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations completely validates their expression
and without any need of multi-sink terms.

enabling various applications of spintronics. The spin Hall response usually
follows a universal scaling relation with longitudinal electric resistivity and
has mild temperature dependence because elementary excitations play only a
minor role in resistivity and hence ISHE. Here we report that the ISHE of
metallic glasses shows nearly two orders of magnitude enhancements with
temperature increase from a threshold of 80-100 K to glass transition points.
As electric resistivity changes only marginally in the temperature range, the
anomalous temperature dependence is in defiance of the prevailing scaling law.
Such a giant temperature enhancement can be well described by a two-level
thermal excitation model of glasses and disappears after crystallization,
suggesting a new mechanism which involves unique thermal excitations of
glasses. This finding may pave new ways to achieve high spin-charge conversion
efficiency at room and higher temperatures for spintronic devices and to detect

thrusts explored since the late 1990's, to date no standard, generalizable
solutions have emerged for effectively integrating and processing multimodal

models are necessary to study the interactions between cellular dynamics and
scaffold (SC) porosity. In experiments, cells are seeded in a porous SC where
over a month, the SC slowly degrades while cells divide and synthesize
extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. We use an off-lattice cellular
automaton framework to model the individual behavior of cells within the SC.
The movement of cells and the ability to reproduce is determined by the
nutrient profile and local porosity. A phenomenological approach is used to
capture a continuous profile for SC and ECM evolution, which will then change
the local porosity. We parameterize the model by matching total cell counts to
chondrocytes seeded in a polyglycolic acid SC. We investigate the total cell
count and location of various cell populations for different initial SC
porosities. Similar to experiments, we observe cell counts that level off
around day 15 with higher values in SCs of lower initial porosity. Cell
clustering is observed in regions at the edge of the construct that are close
to the nutrient-rich medium in the fluid bath. Model results show that a bias
in motion due to sensitivity to porosity allows cells to move in a more optimal
arrangement. We investigate the distribution of cells as the cell reproduction
rate, cell movement distance, and sensitivity to porosity is varied. We observe
non monotonic changes in total cell counts within different regions of the
construct due to the interplay between porosity and cellular movement. We also
analyze the emergent average cell speed for different initial SC porosities,
observing an higher average for the lowest initial SC porosity. This model
provides a framework to further investigate how changes in biological
parameters can change the cellular count and distribution in SCs of different
initial porosity

based on deep machine learning, for lens-less quantitative phase retrieval from
raw intensity data. PhENN is a deep convolutional neural network trained
through examples consisting of pairs of true phase objects and their
corresponding intensity diffraction patterns; thereafter, given a test raw
intensity pattern PhENN is capable of reconstructing the original phase object
robustly, in many cases even for objects outside the database where the
training examples were drawn from. Here, we show that the spatial frequency
content of the training examples is an important factor limiting PhENN's
spatial frequency response. For example, if the training database is relatively
sparse in high spatial frequencies, as most natural scenes are, PhENN's ability
to resolve fine spatial features in test patterns will be correspondingly
limited. To combat this issue, we propose ""flattening"" the power spectral
density of the training examples before presenting them to PhENN. For phase
objects following the statistics of natural scenes, we demonstrate
experimentally that the spectral pre-modulation method enhances the spatial

a tiny correction due to the coupling of radiation with matter and an overlap

higher loop contributions does not affect the convergence of perturbative

game between a soldier and an attacker. In this game, the soldier seeks to
accomplish a time-critical mission by traversing a battlefield within a certain

attacker, on the other hand, seeks to find the optimal opportunity to
compromise the IoBT network and maximize the delay of the soldier's IoBT

captured using tools from psychological game theory, with which the soldier's
and attacker's intentions to harm one another are considered in their
utilities. To solve this game, a novel learning algorithm based on Bayesian

equilibrium of the game. Simulation results show that, based on the error-free
beliefs on the attacker's psychological strategies and beliefs, the soldier's

were performed on Central Processing Units. In previous work we presented a
General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit implementation of the evolution of
cosmological domain wall networks. Here we continue this paradigm shift and
discuss an analogous implementation for local Abelian-Higgs strings networks.
We discuss the implementation algorithm (including the discretization used and
how to calculate network averaged quantities) and then showcase its performance
and current bottlenecks. We validate the code by directly comparing our results
for the canonical scaling properties of the networks in the radiation and
matter eras with those in the literature, finding very good agreement. We
finally highlight possible directions for improving the scalability of the
code.

of a distribution to subtract its density. The reflected non-local priors
forces the Bayesian detector to approach 0 at the non-defect locations. We
conduct experiments studies to demonstrate the superior performance of the

  a heterogeneous quasi-brittle granular material: from suppressed to cascading
  failure","37 pages",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A heterogeneous quasi-brittle granular material can withstand certain levels
of internal damage before global failure. This robustness depends not just on
the bond strengths but also on the topology and redundancy of the bonded
contact network, through which forces and damage propagate. Despite extensive
studies on quasi-brittle failure, there still lacks a unified framework that
can quantify the interdependent evolution of robustness, damage and force
transmission. Here we develop a framework to do so. It is data-driven,
multiscale and relies solely on the contact strengths and topology of the
contact network for material properties. Using data derived from discrete
element simulations of concrete specimens under uniaxial tension, we uncover
evidence of an optimized force transmission, characterized by two novel
transmission patterns that predict and explain damage propagation from the
microstructural to the macroscopic level. The first comprises the optimized
flow routes: shortest possible paths that can transmit the global transmission
capacity. These paths reliably predict tensile force chains. The second are the
force bottlenecks. These provide an early and accurate prediction of the
ultimate pattern, location and interaction of macrocracks. A two-pronged
cooperative mechanism among bottlenecks, enabled by redundancies in
transmission pathways, underlies robustness in the pre-failure regime.
Bottlenecks take turns in accommodating damage, while member contacts spread
the forces to confine damage to low capacity contacts which leave behind a web
of strong contacts to support and curtail the failure of tensile force chains
in the region. This cooperative behavior, while serving to minimize the
inevitable reduction in global transmission capacity, progressively heightens
the interdependency among these contacts and elicits the opposite effect.

frequency to improve the management of surgical departments and to ensure that
decisions are well-informed. Often these analytical techniques rely on the
validity of underlying statistical assumptions, including those around choice
of distribution when modelling uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
research is to determine a set of suitable statistical distributions and
provide recommendations to assist hospital planning staff, based on three full
years of historical data. METHODS: Statistical analysis has been performed to
determine the most appropriate distributions and models in a variety of
surgical contexts. Data from 2013 to 2015 was collected from the surgical
department at a large Australian public hospital. RESULTS: A lognormal
distribution approximation of the total duration of surgeries in an operating
room is appropriate when considering probability of overtime. Surgical requests
can be modelled as a Poisson process with rate dependent on urgency and day of
the week. It is found that individual cancellations can be modelled as
Bernoulli trials, with the probability of patient, staff, and resource based
cancellations provided herein. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis presented here can be
used to ensure that assumptions surrounding planning and scheduling in the
surgical department are valid. Understanding the stochasticity in the surgical
department may result in the implementation of more realistic decision models.

are associated in- or out-of-band with an address and other metadata. Loads
receive these discrete amounts of finely-controlled energy rather than
discretionary amounts after. The control and management of the proposed switch
are based on a request-grant protocol. Using energy packets helps to manage the
delivery of power in a reliable, robust, and function form that may enable
features not yet available in the present power grid. The switch, as any
element of a digital grid, uses a data network for the transmission of these

creating infrastructure in the realization of the digital power grid. The
design of the energy packet switch is based on shared supercapacitors to shape
