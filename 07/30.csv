determine the mass of stellar objects. Using precise astrometric measurements
of the lensed position of a background source in combination with accurate
predictions of the positions of the lens and the unlensed source it is possible
to determine the mass of the lens with an accuracy of a few percent. Aims:
Making use of the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue, we
want to predict astrometric microlensing events caused by foreground stars with
high proper motion passing a background source in the coming decades. Methods:
We selected roughly 148 000 high-proper-motion stars from Gaia DR2 with
$\mu_{tot} > 150\,\mathrm{mas/yr}$ as potential lenses. We then searched for
background sources close to their paths. Using the astrometric parameters of
Gaia DR2, we calculated the future positions of source and lens. With a
nested-intervals algorithm we determined the date and separation of the closest
approach. Using Gaia DR2 photometry we determined an approximate mass of the
lens, which we used to calculate the expected microlensing effects. Results: We
predict 3914 microlensing events caused by 2875 different lenses between 2010
and 2065, with expected shifts larger than $0.1\,\mathrm{mas}$ between the
lensed and unlensed positions of the source. Of those, 513 events are expected
to happen between 2014.5 - 2026.5 and might be measured by Gaia. For 127 events
we also expect a magnification between $1\,\mathrm{mmag}$ and
$3\,\mathrm{mag}$.

The deep learning technique has been verified to be effective for this task and
achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, previous deep learning methods
need to pre-collect a large set of image pairs with/without synthesized rain
for training, which tends to make the neural network be biased toward learning
the specific patterns of the synthesized rain, while be less able to generalize
to real test samples whose rain types differ from those in the training data.
To this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm
toward this task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which only
use supervised image pairs with/without synthesized rain, we further put real
rainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training
process. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an
input rainy image and its expected network output (clear image without rain) as
a specific parametrized rain streaks distribution. The network is therefore
trained to adapt real unsupervised diverse rain types through transferring from
the supervised synthesized rain, and thus both the short-of-training-sample and
bias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated. Experiments on
synthetic and real data verify the superiority of our model compared to the
state-of-the-arts.

of source face to the boundary of target face. Finally, a target-specific
decoder is used to generate the reenacted target face. Thanks to the effective
and reliable boundary-based transfer, our method can perform photo-realistic
face reenactment. In addition, ReenactGAN is appealing in that the whole

  Collaboration","Under review for journal",,,,"cs.RO cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces the Turn-Taking Spiking Neural Network (TTSNet), which
is a cognitive model to perform early turn-taking prediction about human or
agent's intentions. The TTSNet framework relies on implicit and explicit
multimodal communication cues (physical, neurological and physiological) to be
able to predict when the turn-taking event will occur in a robust and
unambiguous fashion. To test the theories proposed, the TTSNet framework was
implemented on an assistant robotic nurse, which predicts surgeon's turn-taking
intentions and delivers surgical instruments accordingly. Experiments were
conducted to evaluate TTSNet's performance in early turn-taking prediction. It
was found to reach a F1 score of 0.683 given 10% of completed action, and a F1
score of 0.852 at 50% and 0.894 at 100% of the completed action. This
performance outperformed multiple state-of-the-art algorithms, and surpassed
human performance when limited partial observation is given (< 40%). Such early
turn-taking prediction capability would allow robots to perform collaborative
actions proactively, in order to facilitate collaboration and increase team
efficiency.

Baire Category, i.e. how many closed nowhere dense sets can be deleted from a

tree-theoretic structures such as the Baire topology are introduced, and the
Baire Category Theorem is extended to a statement that a $\aleph$-sequentially
complete binary tree representation of a Hausdorff topological space that has a
clopen base of cardinality $\aleph$ and no isolated or discrete points is not
the union of $<\aleph+1$-many nowhere dense subsets for cardinal
$\aleph\ge\aleph_{0}$, where a $\aleph$-sequentially complete topological space
is a space where every function $f:\aleph\rightarrow\{0.1\}$ is such that
$(\forall x)(x\in f\rightarrow x\in\in X)\rightarrow(f\in X)$. It is shown that
if $\aleph<\left|X\right|\le2^{\aleph}$ for $\left|X\right|$ the cardinality of
a set $X$, then it is possible to force
$\left|X\right|-\aleph\times\left|X\right|\ne\emptyset$ by deleting a dense
sequence of $\aleph$ specially selected clopen sets, while if any dense
sequence of $\aleph+1$ clopen sets are deleted then
$\left|X\right|-(\aleph+1)\times\left|X\right|=\emptyset$. This gives rise to
an alternative definition of cardinality as the number of basic clopen sets
(intervals in fact) needed to be deleted from a set to force an empty
remainder. This alternative definition of cardinality is consistent with and
follows from the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, which is shown by exhibiting
two models of set theory, one an outer (modal) model, the other an inner,
generalized metric model with an information minimization principle.

Here we show that variations in the lattice geometry can therefore give rise to
more complex band topology than has been previously described. A `spindle'
lattice (or truncated hexagonal tiling) of gyroscopes possesses both clockwise
and counterclockwise edge modes distributed across several band gaps. Tuning
the interaction strength or twisting the lattice structure along a Guest mode
opens and closes these gaps and yields bands with Chern numbers of $|C| > 1$
without introducing next-nearest-neighbor interactions or staggered potentials.
A deformable honeycomb structure provides a simple model for understanding the
role of lattice geometry in constraining the effects of time reversal symmetry
and inversion symmetry breaking. Lastly, we find that topological band
structure generically arises in gyroscopic networks, and a simple protocol
generates lattices with topological excitations.

large histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by
the hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down

microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required
in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is
robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce
overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN
outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving
better accuracy at low inference cost.

data set at various geometric scales. When applied to the description of
molecular structures, persistent homology can capture the multiscale geometric
features and reveal certain interaction patterns in terms of topological
invariants. However, in addition to the geometric information, there is a wide
variety of non-geometric information of molecular structures, such as element
types, atomic partial charges, atomic pairwise interactions, and electrostatic
potential function, that is not described by persistent homology. Although
element specific homology and electrostatic persistent homology can encode some
non-geometric information into geometry based topological invariants, it is
desirable to have a mathematical framework to systematically embed both
geometric and non-geometric information, i.e., multicomponent heterogeneous
information, into unified topological descriptions. To this end, we propose a
mathematical framework based on persistent cohomology. In our framework,
non-geometric information can be either distributed globally or resided locally
on the datasets in the geometric sense and can be properly defined on
topological spaces, i.e., simplicial complexes. Using the proposed persistent
cohomology based framework, enriched barcodes are extracted from datasets to
represent heterogeneous information. We consider a variety of datasets to
validate the present formulation and illustrate the usefulness of the proposed
persistent cohomology. It is found that the proposed framework using cohomology
boosts the performance of persistent homology based methods in the
protein-ligand binding affinity prediction on massive biomolecular datasets.

project, we wanted to relax the simplifying assumptions of a traditional neural
network by making a model that more closely emulates the low level interactions
of neurons. Like in an RNN, our model has a state that persists between time
steps, so that the energies of neurons persist. However, unlike an RNN, our
state consists of a 2 dimensional matrix, rather than a 1 dimensional vector,
thereby introducing a concept of distance to other neurons within the state. In
our model, neurons can only fire to adjacent neurons, as in the brain. Like in
the brain, we only allow neurons to fire in a time step if they contain enough
energy, or excitement. We also enforce a notion of conservation of energy, so
that a neuron cannot excite its neighbors more than the excitement it already
contained at that time step. Taken together, these two features allow signals
in the form of activations to flow around in our network over time, making our
neural mesh more closely model signals traveling through the brain the brain.
Although our main goal is to design an architecture to more closely emulate the
brain in the hope of having a correct internal representation of information by
the time we know how to properly train a general intelligence, we did benchmark
our neural mash on a specific task. We found that by increasing the runtime of
the mesh, we were able to increase its accuracy without increasing the number

using head motion tracked by a head-mounted display (HMD). First-person views
of the vehicles are usually captured by onboard cameras and presented to users
through the display panels of HMDs. This provides users with a direct,
immersive and intuitive interface for viewing and control. However, a typically
overlooked factor in such designs is the latency introduced by the vehicle
dynamics. As head motion is coupled with visual updates in such applications,
visual and control latency always exists between the issue of control commands
by head movements and the visual feedback received at the completion of the
attitude adjustment. This causes a discrepancy between the intended motion, the
vestibular cue and the visual cue and may potentially result in simulator
sickness. No research has been conducted on how various levels of visual and
control latency introduced by dynamics in robots or aerial vehicles affect
users' performance and the degree of simulator sickness elicited. Thus, it is
uncertain how much performance is degraded by latency and whether such designs
are comfortable from the perspective of users. To address these issues, we
studied a prototyped scenario of a head motion controlled quadcopter using an
HMD. We present a virtual reality (VR) paradigm to systematically assess the

which the lensing-induced brightening of the source star lasted for 2 seasons.
We determine the lens mass from the combined measurements of the microlens
parallax $\pie$ and angular Einstein radius $\thetae$. The measured mass
indicates that the lens is a binary composed of M dwarfs with masses of
$M_1\sim 0.34~M_\odot$ and $M_2\sim 0.17~M_\odot$. The measured relative
lens-source proper motion of $\mu\sim 3.9~{\rm mas}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ is smaller
than $\sim 5~{\rm mas}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ of typical Galactic lensing events, while
the estimated angular Einstein radius of $\thetae\sim 1.2~{\rm mas}$ is
substantially greater than the typical value of $\sim 0.5~{\rm mas}$.
Therefore, it turns out that the long time scale of the event is caused by the
combination of the slow $\mu$ and large $\thetae$ rather than the heavy mass of
the lens. From the simulation of Galactic lensing events with very long time
scales ($t_{\rm E}\gtrsim 100$ days), we find that the probabilities that long
time-scale events are produced by lenses with masses $\geq 1.0~M_\odot$ and
$\geq 3.0~M_\odot$ are $\sim 19\%$ and 2.6\%, respectively, indicating that
events produced by heavy lenses comprise a minor fraction of long time-scale
events. The results indicate that it is essential to determine lens masses by
measuring both $\pie$ and $\thetae$ in order to firmly identify heavy stellar
remnants such as neutron stars and black holes.

issues: (1) how to eliminate the renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities
at fixed order, and (2) how to reliably estimate the contributions of unknown
higher-order terms using information from the known pQCD series. The Principle
of Maximum Conformality (PMC) satisfies all of the principles of the
renormalization group and eliminates the scheme-and-scale ambiguities by the
recursive use of the renormalization group equation to determine the scale of
the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$ at each order. Moreover, the resulting PMC
predictions are independent of the choice of the renormalization scheme,
satisfying the key principle of renormalization group invariance. In this
letter, we show that by using the conformal series derived using the PMC
single-scale procedure, in combination with the Pad\'e Approximation Approach
(PAA), one can achieve quantitatively useful estimates for the unknown
higher-order terms from the known perturbative series. We illustrate this
procedure for three hadronic observables $R_{e^+e^-}$, $R_{\tau}$, and
$\Gamma(H \to b \bar{b})$ which are each known to 4 loops in pQCD. We show that
if the PMC prediction for the conformal series for an observable (of leading
order $\alpha_s^p$) has been determined at order $\alpha^n_s$, then the
$[N/M]=[0/n-p]$ Pad\'e series provides quantitatively useful predictions for
the higher-order terms. We also show that the PMC + PAA predictions agree at
all orders with the fundamental, scheme-independent Generalized Crewther
relations which connect observables, such as deep inelastic neutrino-nucleon
scattering, to hadronic $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Thus, by using the combination
of the PMC series and the Pad\'e method, the predictive power of pQCD theory
can be greatly improved.

propagate surface properties to the ocean interior. Its precise understanding
is the prerequisite for addressing essential questions such as oxygen supply,
the storage of anthropogenic carbon and the heat budget of the ocean. Currently
employed observational methods to infer ventilation utilise transient tracers,
i.e. tritium, SF$_6$, CFCs and the radioisotope $^{14}$C. However, their dating
ranges are not suitable to resolve the dynamics of the deep ocean. The noble
gas isotope $^{39}$Ar with a half-life of 269 years fills this gap. Its broad
application has previously been hindered by its very low abundance, requiring
at least 1000 litres of water for dating. Here we report on successful
$^{39}$Ar dating with only 5 litres of water based on the atom-optical
technique Atom Trap Trace Analysis. Our data reveal previously not quantifiable
ventilation patterns in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic, where we find that
advection is more important for the ventilation of the intermediate depth range
than previously assumed. This result implies faster ventilation than estimated
in other studies and thus a significantly higher anthropogenic CO$_2$-storage.
The demonstrated analytical capabilities now allow for a global collection of
$^{39}$Ar data, which will have significant impact on our understanding of
ocean ventilation.

but the success often relies on the heavy network architecture. Taking
well-trained heavy networks as teachers, classical teacher-student learning
paradigm aims to learn a student network that is lightweight yet accurate. In
this way, a portable student network with significantly fewer parameters can
achieve a considerable accuracy which is comparable to that of teacher network.
However, beyond accuracy, robustness of the learned student network against
perturbation is also essential for practical uses. Existing teacher-student
learning frameworks mainly focus on accuracy and compression ratios, but ignore
the robustness. In this paper, we make the student network produce more
confident predictions with the help of the teacher network, and analyze the
lower bound of the perturbation that will destroy the confidence of the student
network. Two important objectives regarding prediction scores and gradients of
examples are developed to maximize this lower bound, so as to enhance the
robustness of the student network without sacrificing the performance.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
approach to learn robust student networks which have satisfying accuracy and
compact sizes.

suppressed, in so-called ""left-handed"" NLTLs, a manifestation of the unique
properties of left-handed media. Here, we demonstrate that harmonic generation
in a left-handed NLTL can be greatly increased by the presence of a topological
edge state. Our NLTL is a nonlinear analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)

solitonic and self-focusing behaviors of modes at the fundamental harmonic. We
find, however, that frequency-mixing processes in an SSH NLTL have important
effects that have previously been neglected. The presence of a topological edge
mode at the first harmonic can produce strong higher-harmonic signals that
propagate into the lattice, acting as an effectively nonlocal cross-phase
nonlinearity. We observe maximum third-harmonic signal intensities that are 5
times that of a comparable left-handed NLTL of a conventional design, and a
250-fold intensity contrast between the topologically nontrivial and trivial
lattice configurations. Our work may have applications for compact electronic
frequency generators, as well as for advancing the fundamental understanding of

the resulting clustering framework is data-free, feature-free, similarity-free,

foundation for abstraction, we also present a top-down and a bottom-up approach
to establish an algorithmic foundation for practical abstraction-generating
methods. Lastly, via both a theoretical explanation and a real-world
application, we illustrate that further coupling of our abstraction framework
with statistics realizes Shannon's information lattice and even further, brings
learning into the picture. This not only presents one use case of our proposed
computational abstraction, but also gives a first step towards a principled and

gallery by comparing the probe image of this person with all the gallery
images. It is generally treated as a retrieval problem, where the affinities
between the probe image and gallery images (P2G affinities) are used to rank
the retrieved gallery images. However, most existing methods only consider P2G
affinities but ignore the affinities between all the gallery images (G2G
affinity). Some frameworks incorporated G2G affinities into the testing
process, which is not end-to-end trainable for deep neural networks. In this
paper, we propose a novel group-shuffling random walk network for fully
utilizing the affinity information between gallery images in both the training
and testing processes. The proposed approach aims at end-to-end refining the
P2G affinities based on G2G affinity information with a simple yet effective
matrix operation, which can be integrated into deep neural networks. Feature
grouping and group shuffle are also proposed to apply rich supervisions for
learning better person features. The proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC datasets by
large margins, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

introduce the philosophy behind Shark and provide an overview of the physical
processes included in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been
parallelized with OpenMP. In the released version (v1.1), we implement several
different models for gas cooling, active galactic nuclei, stellar and
photo-ionisation feedback, and star formation (SF). We demonstrate the basic
performance of Shark using the Planck15 cosmology SURFS simulations, by
comparing against a large set of observations, including: the stellar mass
function (SMF) and stellar-halo mass relation at z=0-4; the cosmic evolution of
the star formation rate density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and molecular
hydrogen; local gas scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties,
finding excellent agreement. Significant improvements over previous SAMs are
seen in the mass-size relation for disks/bulges, the gas-stellar mass and
stellar mass-metallicity relations. To illustrate the power of Shark in
exploring the systematic effects of the galaxy formation modelling, we quantify
how the scatter of the SF main sequence and the gas scaling relations changes
with the adopted SF law, and the effect of the starbursts H$_2$ depletion
timescale on the SFRD and $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$. We compare Shark with other SAMs
and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a much higher
halo baryon fractions due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case
of EAGLE is in the intergalactic medium.

$\mathrm{sig}(T)=(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$ such that $a_i$ is the number of edges of
$T$ in the $i$th direction. We characterise the $n$-tuples that can occur as
the signature of a spanning tree, and classify a signature $\mathcal{S}$ as
reducible or irreducible according to whether or not there is a proper nonempty
subset $R$ of $[n]$ such that restricting $\mathcal{S}$ to the indices in $R$
gives a signature of $Q_{|R|}$. If so, we say moreover that $\mathcal{S}$ and
$T$ reduce over $R$.
  We show that reducibility places strict structural constraints on $T$. In
particular, if $T$ reduces over a set of size $r$ then $T$ decomposes as a sum
of $2^r$ spanning trees of $Q_{n-r}$, together with a spanning tree of a
contraction of $Q_n$ with underlying simple graph $Q_r$. Moreover, this
decomposition is realised by an isomorphism of edge slide graphs, where the
edge slide graph of $Q_n$ is the graph $\mathcal{E}(Q_n)$ on the spanning trees
of $Q_n$, with an edge between two trees if and only if they are related by an
edge slide. An edge slide is an operation on spanning trees of the $n$-cube
given by ``sliding'' an edge of a spanning tree across a $2$-dimensional face
of the cube to get a second spanning tree.
  The signature of a spanning tree is invariant under edge slides, so the
subgraph $\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{S})$ of $\mathcal{E}(Q_n)$ induced by the trees
with signature $\mathcal{S}$ is a union of one or more connected components of
$\mathcal{E}(Q_n)$. Reducible signatures may be further divided into strictly
reducible and quasi-irreducible signatures, and as an application of our
results we show that $\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{S})$ is disconnected if
$\mathcal{S}$ is strictly reducible. We conjecture that the converse is also
true.

equally important to developers. To help developers refactor code and improve
software quality, various tools were built to recommend clone-removal
refactorings based on the past and the present information, such as the
cohesion degree of individual clones or the co-evolution relations of clone
peers. The existence of these tools inspired us to build an approach that
considers as many factors as possible to more accurately recommend clones. This
paper introduces CREC, a learning-based approach that recommends clones by
extracting features from the current status and past history of software
projects. Given a set of software repositories, CREC first automatically
extracts the clone groups historically refactored (R-clones) and those not
refactored (NR-clones) to construct the training set. CREC extracts 34 features
to characterize the content and evolution behaviors of individual clones, as
well as the spatial, syntactical, and co-change relations of clone peers. With
these features, CREC trains a classifier that recommends clones for
refactoring.
  We designed the largest feature set thus far for clone recommendation, and
performed an evaluation on six large projects. The results show that our
approach suggested refactorings with 83% and 76% F-scores in the within-project
and cross-project settings. CREC significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art
similar approach on our data set, with the latter one achieving 70% and 50%
F-scores. We also compared the effectiveness of different factors and different
learning algorithms.

zero field, the thermal conductivity shows a dramatic suppression above a
characteristic temperature $T_s \approx$ 0.12 K. With increasing field, $T_s$
increases and the thermal conductivity tends to saturate above $H$ = 5 T. The
Wiedemann-Franz law is verified at high fields and inferred at zero field. It
suggests the normal behavior of electrons at the quantum critical point, and
the absence of mobile fermionic magnetic excitations. The strong suppression of
thermal conductivity is attributed to the scattering of phonons by the spin
system, likely the fluctuating spins. These results shed new light on the
microscopic description on this novel compound.

that, very surprisingly, the usual expression of the Equivalence Principle is
violated by General Relativity when particles of negative mass are supposed to
exist, which may provide a fundamental explanation of MOND phenomenology,
obviating the need for Dark Matter. Motivated by the observation of repulsive
gravity under the form of Dark Energy, and by the fact that our universe looks
very similar to a coasting (neither decelerating nor accelerating) universe, we
study the Dirac-Milne cosmology, a symmetric matter-antimatter cosmology where
antiparticles have the same gravitational properties as holes in a
semiconductor. Noting the similarities with our universe (age, SN1a luminosity
distance, nucleosynthesis, CMB angular scale), we focus our attention on
structure formation mechanisms, finding strong similarities with our universe.
Additional tests of the Dirac-Milne cosmology are briefly reviewed, and we
finally note that a crucial test of the Dirac-Milne cosmology will be soon
realized at CERN next to the ELENA antiproton decelerator, possibly as early as

gradient flows of single-species particle systems with singular and nonlocal
interactions to particles of opposite sign, any annihilation effect of
particles with opposite sign has been side-stepped. We present the first
rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit passage which includes annihilation. This
result paves the way to applications such as vortices, charged particles, and
dislocations. In more detail, the discrete setting of our discrete-to-continuum
limit passage is given by particles on the real line. Particles of the same
type interact by a singular interaction kernel; those of opposite sign interact
by a regular one. If two particles of opposite sign collide, they annihilate,
i.e., they are taken out of the system. The challenge for proving a
discrete-to-continuum limit is that annihilation is an intrinsically discrete
effect where particles vanish instantaneously in time, while on the continuum
scale the mass of the particle density decays continuously in time. The proof
contains two novelties: (i) the observation that empirical measures of the
discrete dynamics (with annihilation rule) satisfy the continuum evolution
equation that only implicitly encodes annihilation, and (ii) the fact that, by
imposing a relatively mild separation assumption on the initial data, we can
identify the limiting particle density as a solution to the same continuum
evolution equation.

learning provides a satisfactory solution to person re-ID by training a deep
network under supervision of metric loss, e.g., triplet loss. However, the
performance of deep metric learning is greatly limited by traditional sampling
methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Hard-Aware Point-to-Set (HAP2S)
loss with a soft hard-mining scheme. Based on the point-to-set triplet loss
framework, the HAP2S loss adaptively assigns greater weights to harder samples.
Several advantageous properties are observed when compared with other
state-of-the-art loss functions: 1) Accuracy: HAP2S loss consistently achieves
higher re-ID accuracies than other alternatives on three large-scale benchmark
datasets; 2) Robustness: HAP2S loss is more robust to outliers than other
losses; 3) Flexibility: HAP2S loss does not rely on a specific weight function,
i.e., different instantiations of HAP2S loss are equally effective. 4)
Generality: In addition to person re-ID, we apply the proposed method to
generic deep metric learning benchmarks including CUB-200-2011 and Cars196, and
also achieve state-of-the-art results.

demonstrating strong circular dichroism in helically twisted hollow-core
single-ring photonic crystal fiber (SR-PCF), formed by spinning the preform
during fiber drawing. In the SR-PCFs studied, the hollow core is surrounded by
a single ring of non-touching capillaries. Coupling between these capillaries
results in the formation of helical Bloch modes carrying orbital angular
momentum. In the twisted fiber, strong circular birefringence appears in the
ring, so that when a core mode with a certain circular polarization state (say
LC) phase-matches to the ring, the other (RC) is strongly dephased. If in
addition the orbital angular momentum is the same in core and ring, and the
polarization states are non-orthogonal (e.g., slightly elliptical), the LC core
mode will experience high loss while the RC mode is efficiently transmitted.
The result is a single-circular-polarization SR-PCF that acts as a circular
polarizer over a certain wavelength range. Such fibers have many potential
applications, for example, for generating circularly polarized light in
gas-filled SR-PCF and realizing polarizing elements in the deep and vacuum

statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas
represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a
confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our
method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting
the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of
Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which
leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better
emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to
represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space,
where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical
point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily
carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be
leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of
critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially
parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the
confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively
evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering
approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of

Toeplitz operators in true polyanalytic spaces to the ones in the usual Bergman
type spaces, however with distributional symbols. This reduction leads to
describing a number of properties of the operators in the title, which may
differ from the properties of the usual Bergman-Toeplitz operators.

formation of {\em stake pools}\ in collaborative projects that involve a large
number of stakeholders such as the maintenance of a proof-of-stake (PoS)
blockchain. Our mechanisms are parameterized by a target value for the desired
number of pools. We show that by properly incentivizing participants, the
desired number of stake pools is a Nash equilibrium arising from rational play.
Our equilibria also exhibit an efficiency / security tradeoff via a parameter
that calibrates between including pools with the smallest cost and providing
protection against Sybil attacks, the setting where a single stakeholder
creates a large number of pools in the hopes to dominate the collaborative
project. We then describe how RSS can be deployed in the PoS setting,
mitigating a number of potential deployment attacks and protocol deviations
that include censoring transactions, performing Sybil attacks with the
objective to control the majority of stake, lying about the actual cost and
others. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate fast convergence to equilibria
in dynamic environments where players react to each other's strategic moves
over an indefinite period of interactive play. We also show how simple reward
sharing schemes that are seemingly more ""fair"", perhaps counterintuitively,
converge to centralized equilibria.

word similarity in forms of distances in a word embedding space. The proposed
loss function encourages an NMT decoder to generate words close to their

acceptable words when the actual best candidates are not included in the
vocabulary due to its size limitation. In experiments using ASPEC
Japanese-to-English and IWSLT17 English-to-French data sets, the proposed
method showed improvements against a standard NMT baseline in both datasets;
especially with IWSLT17 En-Fr, it achieved up to +1.72 in BLEU and +1.99 in

  Review",,"10.1175/MWR-D-19-0240.1",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data assimilation combines forecasts from a numerical model with
observations. Most of the current data assimilation algorithms consider the
model and observation error terms as additive Gaussian noise, specified by
their covariance matrices Q and R, respectively. These error covariances, and
specifically their respective amplitudes, determine the weights given to the
background (i.e., the model forecasts) and to the observations in the solution
of data assimilation algorithms (i.e., the analysis). Consequently, Q and R
matrices significantly impact the accuracy of the analysis. This review aims to
present and to discuss, with a unified framework, different methods to jointly
estimate the Q and R matrices using ensemble-based data assimilation
techniques. Most of the methodologies developed to date use the innovations,
defined as differences between the observations and the projection of the
forecasts onto the observation space. These methodologies are based on two main
statistical criteria: (i) the method of moments, in which the theoretical and
empirical moments of the innovations are assumed to be equal, and (ii) methods
that use the likelihood of the observations, themselves contained in the
innovations. The reviewed methods assume that innovations are Gaussian random
variables, although extension to other distributions is possible for
likelihood-based methods. The methods also show some differences in terms of
levels of complexity and applicability to high-dimensional systems. The
conclusion of the review discusses the key challenges to further develop
estimation methods for Q and R. These challenges include taking into account
time-varying error covariances, using limited observational coverage,
estimating additional deterministic error terms, or accounting for correlated
noises.

and shading layers of an image, which is a challenging and underdetermined

a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Although deep learning (DL) has been
recently used to handle this application, the current DL methods train the

shading for real images is difficult. Therefore, these methods fail to produce
reasonable results on real images and often perform worse than the non-DL

train our network on both synthetic and real images. Specifically, in addition
to directly supervising the network using synthetic images, we train the
network by enforcing it to produce the same reflectance for a pair of images of
the same real-world scene with different illuminations. Furthermore, we improve
the results by incorporating a bilateral solver layer into our system during
both training and test stages. Experimental results show that our approach
produces better results than the state-of-the-art DL and non-DL methods on

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) applying deep learning methods to neuroimaging data.
Even for 2017, there were published more than a hundred papers dedicated to AD
diagnosis, whereas only a few works considered a problem of mild cognitive
impairments (MCI) conversion to the AD. However, the conversion prediction is
an important problem since approximately 15% of patients with MCI converges to
the AD every year. In the current work, we are focusing on the conversion
prediction using brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging and clinical data, such as
demographics, cognitive assessments, genetic, and biochemical markers. First of
all, we applied state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on the neuroimaging
data and compared these results with two machine learning algorithms that we
fit using the clinical data. As a result, the models trained on the clinical
data outperform the deep learning algorithms applied to the MR images. To
explore the impact of neuroimaging further, we trained a deep feed-forward
embedding using similarity learning with Histogram loss on all available MRIs
and obtained 64-dimensional vector representation of neuroimaging data. The use
of learned representation from the deep embedding allowed to increase the
quality of prediction based on the neuroimaging. Finally, the current results
on this dataset show that the neuroimaging does affect conversion prediction,
however, cannot noticeably increase the quality of the prediction. The best
results of predicting MCI-to-AD conversion are provided by XGBoost algorithm
trained on the clinical and embedding data. The resulting accuracy is 0.76 +-
0.01 and the area under the ROC curve - 0.86 +- 0.01.

significant importance in a wide range of remote sensing applications. However,
many confusing manmade objects and intricate fine-structured objects make it
very difficult to obtain both coherent and accurate labeling results. For this
challenging task, we propose a novel deep model with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), i.e., an end-to-end self-cascaded network (ScasNet).
Specifically, for confusing manmade objects, ScasNet improves the labeling
coherence with sequential global-to-local contexts aggregation. Technically,
multi-scale contexts are captured on the output of a CNN encoder, and then they
are successively aggregated in a self-cascaded manner. Meanwhile, for
fine-structured objects, ScasNet boosts the labeling accuracy with a
coarse-to-fine refinement strategy. It progressively refines the target objects
using the low-level features learned by CNN's shallow layers. In addition, to
correct the latent fitting residual caused by multi-feature fusion inside
ScasNet, a dedicated residual correction scheme is proposed. It greatly
improves the effectiveness of ScasNet. Extensive experimental results on three
public datasets, including two challenging benchmarks, show that ScasNet
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

the SEPs may produce a spectral bump at $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$eV, exceeding the

at $\gtrsim 100$keV, distinct from the hard spectral slope in the leptonic

hadronic origin, the SEP synchrotron radiation with $B\sim 400 - 500 \mu$G can
well account for the observed radio flux and spectral slopes, supporting the

poor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop
between stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive
stimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to
monitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography
(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel
mechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during
stimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling
rig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and
stimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the

for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). First the locally averaged
Navier-Stokes equations are derived in a mathematically rigorous way to
demonstrate the ""missing"" turbulent stress in standard SPH formulations. It is
then shown that with a proper choice of velocity smoothing, SPH and large eddy
simulation (LES) equivalently solve the same set of filtered equations that
require closure approximations. The only difference between SPH and LES, as
demonstrated in this paper is the representation of governing equations; for
the former the equations are in integro-differential form whereas for the
latter they are in differential form. One direct consequence of this
equivalence between SPH and LES is that turbulence modeling techniques
originally developed for LES can easily be adopted into this version of SPH.
Our representation of the sub-grid stress tensor in integral form will provide
insight into alternative approaches for dealing with turbulence modeling.
Although the use of the Smagorinsky model is the common practice for turbulence
modeling in LES, it will be shown that for SPH the most natural choice is to
use approximate deconvolution methods. The other particularly fundamental
consequence of our choice of velocity smoothing is that the resulting filtered
equations are nonconservative in nature and a correct Lagrangian cannot be
easily constructed.

a comprehensive picture of present objects in a given high resolution aerial
image can provide more in-depth understanding of the studied region. For these
reasons, aerial image multi-label classification has been attracting increasing
attention. However, one common limitation shared by existing methods in the
community is that the co-occurrence relationship of various classes, so called
class dependency, is underexplored and leads to an inconsiderate decision. In
this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end network, namely class-wise

1) a feature extraction module, 2) a class attention learning layer, and 3) a
bidirectional LSTM-based sub-network. Particularly, the feature extraction
module is designed for extracting fine-grained semantic feature maps, while the
class attention learning layer aims at capturing discriminative class-specific
features. As the most important part, the bidirectional LSTM-based sub-network
models the underlying class dependency in both directions and produce
structured multiple object labels. Experimental results on UCM multi-label

characterize the phases according to their gapless or gapped nature by
determining the spectral weight at the Fermi level. We find that gapless
topological nontrivial phases are supported for both Anderson and binary

acquisition arises in scenarios where edge devices (or even servers) are

solution, called fast analog transmission (FAT), for high- mobility data
acquisition in edge-learning systems, which has several key features. First,
FAT incurs low-latency. Specifically, FAT requires no source-and-channel coding
and no channel training via the proposed technique of Grassmann analog encoding
(GAE) that encodes data samples into subspace matrices. Second, FAT supports
spatial multiplexing by directly transmitting analog vector data over an
antenna array. Third, FAT can be seamlessly integrated with edge learning
(i.e., training of a classifier model in this work). In particular, by applying
a Grassmannian-classification algorithm from computer vision, the received GAE
encoded data can be directly applied to training the model without decoding and
conversion. This design is found by simulation to outperform conventional
schemes in learning accuracy due to its robustness against data distortion
induced by fast fading.

spatial or channel dimension of filters, our proposed method mainly focuses on
exploiting the filter group structure for each layer. For several commonly used
CNN models, including VGG and ResNet, our method can reduce over 80%
floating-point operations (FLOPs) with less accuracy drop than state-of-the-art

  Stochastic Quantisation","A new section discusses how stochastic quantisation accommodates the

  but the paper is also reshaped for an easier reading",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Euclidean quantum gravity might be defined by stochastic quantisation that is
governed by a higher order Langevin equation rather than a first order
stochastic equation. In a transitory phase where the Lorentz time cannot be
defined, the parameter that orders the evolution of quantum gravity phenomena
is the stochastic time. This changes the definition of causality in the period
of primordial cosmology. The prediction of stochastically quantised gravity is
that there will a transition from an oscillating quantum phase to a
semi-classical one, when the Lorentz time emerges. The end of the transition,
as it can be observed from now and described by inflation models, is a diluted
Universe, following the inflation phenomenological evolution. It is filled at
the beginning with scattered classical primordial black holes. The smallest
ones will quickly decay in matter, with a standard quantum field theory
evolution till our period. The stable heavier black holes will remain, forming
a good fraction of the dark matter and the large black holes observed in the
galaxies. In a theoretically related way, this framework suggests the
possibility of a gravitational parton content for ""point-like"" particles, in
the same five dimensional quantum field theory context as in the primordial
cosmology, with a (+----) signature for the 5d metrics. The very precise and
explicit result expressed in this paper is actually far more modest than its
motivation. We compute explicitly the meaning of a second order Langevin
equation in zero dimensions and define precisely what is second order
stochastic quantisation in a soluble case.

motion of a fruit fly around a given spot of food but shall generally describe
local search behavior. The local search consists of a sequence of two epochs.
In the first the searcher explores new space around the home whereas it returns
to the home during the second epoch. In the proposed two dimensional model both
tasks are described by the same stochastic dynamics. The searcher moves with
constant speed and its angular dynamics is driven by a symmetric
{\alpha}-stable noise source. The latter stands for the uncertainty to decide
the new direction of motion. The main ingredient of the model is the nonlinear
interaction dynamics of the searcher with its home. In order to determine the
new heading direction, the angles of its position to the home and of the
heading vector need to be known. A bound state to the home is realized by a
permanent switch of a repulsive and attractive forcing of the heading direction
from the position direction corresponding to search and return epochs. Our
investigation elucidates the analytic tractability of the deterministic and
stochastic dynamics. The noise enables a faster finding of a target distinct
from the home with optimal intensity. This optimal situation is related to the
noise dependent relaxation time. It is uniquely defined for all {\alpha} and
distinguishes between the stochastic dynamics before and after its value. For
times large compared to this we derive the corresponding Smoluchowski equation
and find diffusive spreading of searcher in the space. As result of its
simplicity the model aims to reproduce the local search behavior of simple
units during their exploration of surrounding space and their quasi-periodic
return to a home.

deeply embedded stage and then disk-dominated stage, before they end up on the
main sequence. Knowing how much time a system spends in each stage is crucial
for understanding how stars and associated planetary systems form, because a
key constraint is the time available to form such systems. Equally important is
understanding what the spread in these time scales is. The most commonly used
method for inferring protostellar ages is to assume the lifetime of one
evolutionary stage, and then scale this to the relative number of protostars in
the other stages, i.e., assuming steady state. This method does not account for
the underlying age distribution and apparent stochasticity of star formation,
nor that relative populations are not in steady state. To overcome this, we
propose a new scheme where the lifetime of each protostellar stage follows a
distribution based on the formalism of sequential nuclear decay. The main
assumptions are: Class 0 sources follow a straight path to Class III sources,
the age distribution follows a binomial distribution, and the star-formation
rate is constant. The results are that the half-life of Class 0, Class I, and
Flat sources are (2.4+/-0.2)%, (4.4+/-0.3)%, and (4.3+/-0.4)% of the Class II
half-life, respectively, which translates to 47+/-4, 88+/-7, and 87+/-8 kyr,
respectively, for a Class II half-life of 2 Myr for protostars in the Gould
Belt clouds with more than 100 protostars. The mean age of these clouds is
1.2+/-0.1 Myr, and the star formation rate is (8.3+/-0.5)x10^-4 Msun/yr. The
critical parameters in arriving at these numbers are the assumed half-life of
the Class II stage, and the assumption that the star-formation rate and
half-lives are constant. This method presents a first step in moving from
steady-state to non-steady-state solutions of protostellar populations.

essentially guarantees that program semantics are independent from type-checker

enforcing, for example, that a single order relation is used for all

  The features that could not be offered include explicit dictionary

propose a new design for offering explicit dictionary application, without
compromising coherence and global uniqueness. We introduce a novel criterion
based on GHC's type argument roles to decide when a dictionary application is
safe with respect to global uniqueness of instances. We preserve coherence by
detecting potential sources of incoherence, and prove it formally. Moreover,

cumulative long-term reward in a Markov decision process with unknown
transition probabilities and instantaneous rewards. In this paper, we consider
the problem of finding such optimal policies while assuming they are continuous
functions belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). To learn the
optimal policy we introduce a stochastic policy gradient ascent algorithm with
three unique novel features: (i) The stochastic estimates of policy gradients
are unbiased. (ii) The variance of stochastic gradients is reduced by drawing
on ideas from numerical differentiation. (iii) Policy complexity is controlled
using sparse RKHS representations. Novel feature (i) is instrumental in proving
convergence to a stationary point of the expected cumulative reward. Novel
feature (ii) facilitates reasonable convergence times. Novel feature (iii) is a
necessity in practical implementations which we show can be done in a way that
does not eliminate convergence guarantees. Numerical examples in standard
problems illustrate successful learning of policies with low complexity
representations which are close to stationary points of the expected cumulative
reward.

components in the spectral signature: an extremely broad line component
associated with the outflowing gas, a narrow line component associated with the
cold envelope, and a broad line component tracing the hot corino. NOEMA

high-velocity jet associated with HH377. Our interferometric maps show that
COMs arises from a region of 0.7"" size around CepE-A. Rotational temperatures
were found to lie in the range 20-40 K with column densities ranging from a few
10^15 cm-2 for O-bearing species, down to a few 10^14 cm-2 for N-bearing

determinations in current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. The
first step, however, is to understand the pion production reactions at the free
nucleon level. We present an exhaustive study of the charged-current and
neutral-current neutrino and antineutrino pion production off nucleons, paying
a special attention to the angular distributions of the outgoing pion. We show,
using general arguments, that parity violation and time-reversal odd
correlations in the weak differential cross sections are generated from the
interference between different contributions to the hadronic current that are
not relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of
the art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and
we also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of
the vector content of these models. We also illustrate the importance of
carrying out a comprehensive test at the level of outgoing pion angular
distributions, going beyond comparisons done for partially integrated cross
sections, where model differences cancel to a certain extent. Finally, we
observe that all charged and neutral current distributions show sizable
anisotropies, and identify channels for which parity violating effects are
clearly visible. Based on the above results, we conclude that the use of
isotropic distributions for the pions in the center of mass of the final

reference, such as Earth's revolutions or swings of a pendulum. By referencing
atomic transitions, frequency (and thus time) can be measured more precisely
than any other physical quantity, with the current generation of optical atomic
clocks reporting fractional performance below the $10^{-17}$ level. However,
the theory of relativity prescribes that the passage of time is not absolute,
but impacted by an observer's reference frame. Consequently, clock measurements
exhibit sensitivity to relative velocity, acceleration and gravity potential.
Here we demonstrate optical clock measurements surpassing the present-day
ability to account for the gravitational distortion of space-time across the
surface of Earth. In two independent ytterbium optical lattice clocks, we
demonstrate unprecedented levels in three fundamental benchmarks of clock
performance. In units of the clock frequency, we report systematic uncertainty
of $1.4 \times 10^{-18}$, measurement instability of $3.2 \times 10^{-19}$ and
reproducibility characterised by ten blinded frequency comparisons, yielding a
frequency difference of $[-7 \pm (5)_{stat} \pm (8)_{sys}] \times 10^{-19}$.
While differential sensitivity to gravity could degrade the performance of
these optical clocks as terrestrial standards of time, this same sensitivity
can be used as an exquisite probe of geopotential. Near the surface of Earth,
clock comparisons at the $1 \times 10^{-18}$ level provide 1 cm resolution
along gravity, outperforming state-of-the-art geodetic techniques. These
optical clocks can further be used to explore geophysical phenomena, detect
gravitational waves, test general relativity and search for dark matter.

states and which are not observable when Fock states interfere. Using the first
three moments, we formulate the tools required to experimentally observe
signatures of quantum interference of Gaussian states using two outputs only.
By considering the current architectural limitations in realistic experiments,
we further show that a statistically significant discrimination between quantum
and classical interference is possible even in the presence of loss, noise, and
a finite photon-number resolution. Therefore, we formulate and apply a
theoretical framework to benchmark the quantum features of Gaussian boson
sampling under realistic conditions.

obtained for ordinary K3 surfaces by Nygaard and Ogus. In this paper, we
construct canonical liftings modulo $p^2$ of varieties with trivial canonical
class which are ordinary in the weak sense that the Frobenius acts bijectively
on the top cohomology of the structure sheaf. Consequently, we obtain a
Frobenius lifting on the moduli space of such varieties. The quite explicit
construction uses Frobenius splittings and a relative version of Witt vectors
of length two. If the variety has a smooth deformation space and bijective
first higher Hasse-Witt operation, the Frobenius lifting gives rise to
canonical coordinates. One of the key features of our liftings is that the
crystalline Frobenius preserves the Hodge filtration. We also extend Nygaard's

from pairwise distances (or proximity measurements), is a principal challenge
in a wide variety of fields. Conventionally, when localizing a static network
of immobile nodes, non-linear dimensional reduction techniques are applied on
the measured Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) to obtain the relative coordinates
upto a rotation and translation. In this article, we focus on an anchorless
network of mobile nodes, where the distance measurements between the mobile
nodes are time-varying in nature. Furthermore, in an anchorless network the
absolute knowledge of any node positions, motion or reference frame is absent.
We derive a novel data model which relates the time-varying EDMs to the
time-varying relative positions of an anchorless network. Using this data
model, we estimate the relative position, relative velocity and higher order
derivatives, which are collectively termed as the relative kinematics of the
anchorless network. The derived data model is inherently ill-posed, however can
be solved using certain relative immobility constraints. We propose elegant
closed form solutions to recursively estimate the relative kinematics of the
network. For the sake of completeness, estimators are also proposed to find the
absolute kinematics of the nodes, given known reference anchors. Cramer-Rao
bounds are derived for the new data model and simulations are performed to
analyze the performance of the proposed solutions.

disjunctive sum, taking options and conjugates. We use novel results from
absolute combinatorial game theory (Larsson, Nowakowski, Santos 2017) to show
that $\mathcal{E}$ and the universe $\mathcal{D}\subset \mathcal{E}$ of dicot
games (either both, or none of the players can move) have 'options only' test
for comparison of games, and this in turn is used to define unique reduced
games (canonical forms) in $\mathcal{E}$. We develop the reductions for
$\mathcal{E}$ by extending analogous work for $\mathcal{D}$, in particular by
solving the problem of reversibility through ends in the larger universe.
Finally, by using the defined canonical forms in $\mathcal{E}$ and
$\mathcal{D}$, we prove that both of these universes, as well as the
subuniverse of impartial games, have the conjugate property: every inverse game

constrain the properties of the dust observed in the submillimetre in the

of different total dust masses and grain sizes on the SED, and attempted to
consistently reproduce the SEDs from the optical to the submm. We derive dust
masses in the shells of a few 10e-5 Msun, assuming spherical, solid grains. The
best-fit grain radii are comparatively large, and indicate the presence of
grains between 0.1 micron-2 micron. The LABOCA observations suffer from
contamination from 12CO(3-2), and hence gives fluxes that are higher than the
predicted dust emission at submm wavelengths. We investigate the effect on the
best-fitting models by assuming different degrees of contamination and show
that far-infrared and submillimetre observations are important to constrain the

our new cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE model that
self-consistently vary the IMF on a per-particle basis such that it becomes
either bottom-heavy (LoM-50) or top-heavy (HiM-50) in high-pressure
environments. These simulations were calibrated to reproduce inferred IMF
variations such that the IMF becomes ""heavier"" due to either excess dwarf stars
or stellar remnants, respectively, in galaxies with increasing stellar velocity
dispersion. In agreement with observations, both simulations produce negative
radial IMF gradients, transitioning from high to low excess mass-to-light ratio
(MLE) at around $r_e$. We find negative metallicity radial gradients for both
simulations, but positive and flat [Mg/Fe] gradients in LoM-50 and HiM-50,
respectively. Measured in radial bins, the MLE increases strongly with local
metallicity for both simulations, in agreement with observations. However, the
local MLE increases and decreases with local [Mg/Fe] in LoM-50 and HiM-50,
respectively. These qualitative differences can be used to break degeneracies
in the manner with which the IMF varies in these high-mass ETGs. At $z=2$, we
find that the MLE has a higher and lower normalization for bottom- and

characterisation for crystalline materials. This technique can rapidly acquire
and index diffraction patterns to provide phase and orientation information
about the crystals on the material surface. The conventional analysis method
uses signal processing based on a Hough/Radon transform to index each
diffraction pattern. This method is limited to the analysis of simple geometric
features and ignores subtle characteristics of diffraction patterns, such as
variations in relative band intensities. A second method, developed to address
the shortcomings of the Hough/Radon transform, is based on template matching of
a test experimental pattern with a large library of potential patterns. In the
present work, the template matching approach has been refined with a new cross
correlation function that allows for a smaller library and enables a dramatic
speed up in pattern indexing. Refinement of the indexed orientation is
performed with a follow-up step to allow for small alterations to the best
match from the library search. The orientation is further refined with rapid
measurement of misorientation using whole pattern matching. The refined
template matching approach is shown to be comparable in accuracy, precision and

algorithms to overcome the new technical challenges as large collecting area,
wide field of view and huge data volume. Specifically, we study the calibration
of radio interferometry stations with significant direction dependent
distortions. We propose an iterative robust calibration algorithm based on a
relaxed maximum likelihood estimator for a specific context: i) observations
are affected by the presence of outliers and ii) parameters of interest have a
specific structure depending on frequency. Variation of parameters across
frequency is addressed through a distributed procedure, which is consistent
with the new radio synthesis arrays where the full observing bandwidth is
divided into multiple frequency channels. Numerical simulations reveal that the
proposed robust distributed calibration estimator outperforms the conventional
non-robust algorithm and/or the mono-frequency case.

statistics of personal data (e.g., distribution underlying the data) while
protecting users' privacy. Although LDP does not require a trusted third party,
it regards all personal data equally sensitive, which causes excessive
obfuscation hence the loss of utility. In this paper, we introduce the notion
of ULDP (Utility-optimized LDP), which provides a privacy guarantee equivalent
to LDP only for sensitive data. We first consider the setting where all users
use the same obfuscation mechanism, and propose two mechanisms providing ULDP:
utility-optimized randomized response and utility-optimized RAPPOR. We then
consider the setting where the distinction between sensitive and non-sensitive
data can be different from user to user. For this setting, we propose a
personalized ULDP mechanism with semantic tags to estimate the distribution of
personal data with high utility while keeping secret what is sensitive for each
user. We show theoretically and experimentally that our mechanisms provide much
higher utility than the existing LDP mechanisms when there are a lot of
non-sensitive data. We also show that when most of the data are non-sensitive,
our mechanisms even provide almost the same utility as non-private mechanisms
in the low privacy regime.

compiled, validated and distributed following the Software Provisioning Process

The umd-verification tool has been successfully integrated within the SWPP

dependant on the availability of Infrastructure as Code solutions to take over
the deployment and high test coverage, the results obtained for the already
integrated products are promising, as the time invested in the validation of
products has been drastically reduced. Furthermore, automation adoption has
brought along benefits for the reliability of the process, such as the removal
of human-associated errors or the risk of regression of previously tested

The KDE Markov models (KDE-MMs) we discuss are nonlinear, nonparametric, fully
probabilistic representations of stationary processes, based on techniques with
strong asymptotic consistency properties. The models generate new data by
concatenating points from the training data sequences in a context-sensitive
manner, together with some additive driving noise. We present novel EM-type
maximum-likelihood algorithms for data-driven bandwidth selection in KDE-MMs.
Additionally, we augment the KDE-MMs with a hidden state, yielding a new model
class, KDE-HMMs. The added state variable captures non-Markovian long memory
and signal structure (e.g., slow oscillations), complementing the short-range
dependences described by the Markov process. The resulting joint Markov and
hidden-Markov structure is appealing for modelling complex real-world processes
such as speech signals. We present guaranteed-ascent EM-update equations for
model parameters in the case of Gaussian kernels, as well as relaxed update
formulas that greatly accelerate training in practice. Experiments demonstrate
increased held-out set probability for KDE-HMMs on several challenging natural

approximately constant as a function of multiplicity, the corresponding ratios
of strange hadrons to pions show a significant enhancement that increases with
increasing strangeness content. Furthermore, all identified particle to pion
ratios are shown to depend solely on charged-particle multiplicity density,
regardless of system type and collision energy. The evolution of the spectral

those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. The obtained

(DCF) has been proven to be very successful in recent video object tracking

two major issues, i.e., spatial boundary effect and temporal filter
degradation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a new DCF-based tracking
method. The key innovations of the proposed method include adaptive spatial
feature selection and temporal consistent constraints, with which the new
tracker enables joint spatial-temporal filter learning in a lower dimensional
discriminative manifold. More specifically, we apply structured spatial
sparsity constraints to multi-channel filers. Consequently, the process of
learning spatial filters can be approximated by the lasso regularisation. To
encourage temporal consistency, the filter model is restricted to lie around
its historical value and updated locally to preserve the global structure in
the manifold. Last, a unified optimisation framework is proposed to jointly
select temporal consistency preserving spatial features and learn
discriminative filters with the augmented Lagrangian method. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations have been conducted on a number of well-known
benchmarking datasets such as OTB2013, OTB50, OTB100, Temple-Colour, UAV123 and

improve the signal-to-noise ratio and alleviate the critical slowing down of
the topological modes. We provide continuum extrapolations for the second and
fourth order coefficients in the Taylor expansion in $\theta$ of the vacuum
energy of the theory, parameterized in terms of the topological susceptibility
$\chi$ and of the so-called $b_2$ coefficient. Those are then compared with
available analytic predictions obtained within the $1/N$ expansion, pointing
out that higher order corrections might be relevant in the explored range of
$N$, and that this fact might be related to the non-analytic behavior expected
for $N = 2$. We also consider sixth-order corrections in the $\theta$
expansion, parameterized in terms of the so-called $b_4$ coefficient: in this
case our present statistical accuracy permits to have reliable non-zero
continuum estimations only for $N \leq 11$, while for larger values we can only
set upper bounds. The sign and values obtained for $b_4$ are compared to
large-$N$ predictions, as well as to results obtained for $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills

design of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Two examples of fundamental
importance are the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS) and the Zig-Zag process (ZZ).
In this paper scaling limits for both algorithms are determined. Here the
dimensionality of the space tends towards infinity and the target distribution
is the multivariate standard normal distribution. For several quantities of
interest (angular momentum, first coordinate, and negative log-density) the
scaling limits show qualitatively very different and rich behaviour. Based on
these scaling limits the performance of the two algorithms in high dimensions
can be compared. Although for angular momentum both processes require only a
computational effort of $O(d)$ to obtain approximately independent samples, the
computational effort for negative log-density and first coordinate differ: for
these BPS requires $O(d^2)$ computational effort whereas ZZ requires $O(d)$.
Finally we provide a criterion for the choice of the refreshment rate of BPS.

are: interpolation using cubic splines, FIR filter, IIR filter, least mean
square adaptive filtering, moving-average filter, independent component
analysis, interpolation and successive subtraction of median values in RR
interval, empirical mode decomposition and wavelet filtering. For the
quantitative evaluation, the following similarity metrics were used: absolute

`Chiral formulations of gravity' - they are surprising as they typically do not
rely on a metric. Another is the existence of the Twistor correspondence. The
Chiral and Twistor formulations might seems different in nature. In the first
part of this thesis we demonstrate that they are in fact closely related. In
particular we give a new proof for Penrose's `non-linear graviton theorem' that
relies on the geometry of SU(2)-connections only (rather than on metric). In
the second part of this thesis we describe partial results towards encoding the
full GR in the total space of some fibre bundle over space-time. We indeed show
that gravity theory in three and four dimensions can be related to theories of
a completely different nature in six and seven dimension respectively. This
theories, first advertised by Hitchin, are diffeomorphism invariant theories of
differential three-forms. Starting with seven dimensions, we are only partially
succesfull: the resulting theory is some deformed version of gravity. We
however found that solutions to a particular gravity theory in four dimension
have a seven dimensional interpretation as G2 holonomy manifold. On the other
hand by going from six to three dimension we do recover three dimensional
gravity. As a bonus, we describe new diffeomorphism invariant functionnals for
differential forms in six dimension and prove that two of them are topological.

infrastructure layer developed on top of Ethereum Blockchain, as a network
protocol which allows coherent routing and interlocking channel transfers for
trade-off between parties. A web-scale solution for state channels is
implemented to enable a layer of value transfer to the internet. Existing
network protocol on State Channels include Raiden for Ethereum and Lightning
Network for Bitcoin. However, we intend to leverage existing web-scale
technologies used by large Internet companies such as Uber, LinkedIn or
Netflix. We use Apache Kafka to scale the global payment operation to trillions
of operations per day enabling near-instant, low-fee, scalable, and
privacy-sustainable payments. Our architecture follows Event Sourcing pattern
which solves current issues of payment solutions such as scaling, transfer,

their high potential with regards to simplified mesh generation, treatment of
large structural motions in surrounding flows, capturing boundary layers, their
ability to deal with topological changes in the fluid phase and their general
straightforward extensibility to other coupled multiphysics problems. In
addition to a pure fixed-grid FSI method, also advanced fluid domain

defines a partial order among bipartite pure states that makes it possible to
identify a maximally entangled state, which turns out to be the most relevant
state in applications. However, the situation changes drastically in the
multipartite regime. Not only do there exist inequivalent forms of entanglement
forbidding the existence of a unique maximally entangled state, but recent

no inequivalent forms of entanglement exist in them and they induce a
meaningful partial order (i.e. every pure state is transformable to more weakly

transition of order $\nu = \min(1,\alpha)^{-1}$, together with -- in general --
other phase transitions. In this paper, we turn to the disordered model, and we
address the question of the influence of disorder on the denaturation phase
transition, that is whether adding an arbitrarily small amount of disorder
(i.e. inhomogeneities) affects the critical properties of this transition. Our
results are consistent with Harris' predictions for $d$-dimensional disordered
systems (here $d=2$). First, we prove that when $\alpha<1$ (i.e. $\nu>d/2$),
then disorder is irrelevant: the quenched and annealed critical points are
equal, and the disordered denaturation phase transition is also of order
$\nu=\alpha^{-1}$. On the other hand, when $\alpha>1$, disorder is relevant: we
prove that the quenched and annealed critical points differ.
  Moreover, we discuss a number of open problems, in particular the smoothing

mathematically sound foundation of topological quantum computing in the

""decategorize"" the foundation. But we discovered, to our surprise, that
category theory (or something like it) is necessary for the purpose, for
computational reasons. The goal of this note is to give a high-level
explanation of that necessity, which avoids details and which suggests that the
case of topological quantum computing is far from unique.

heterogeneous integration of materials, has led to increased challenges in
addressing their thermal operational-temperature demands. The heat flow in
these systems is significantly influenced or even dominated by thermal boundary
resistance at interface between dissimilar materials. However, controlling and
tuning heat transport across an interface and in the adjacent materials has so
far drawn limited attention. In this work, we grow chemical-vapor-deposited
(CVD) diamond on silicon substrates by graphoepitaxy and experimentally
demonstrate tunable thermal transport across diamond membranes and
diamond-silicon interfaces. We observed the highest diamond-silicon thermal
boundary conductance (TBC) measured to date and increased diamond thermal
conductivity due to strong grain texturing in the diamond near the interface.
Additionally, non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics (NEMD) simulations and a
Landauer approach are used to understand the diamond-silicon TBC. These
findings pave the way for tuning or increasing thermal conductance in
heterogeneously integrated electronics that involve polycrystalline materials
and will impact applications including electronics thermal management and
diamond growth.

  This question was answered by Laplaza when both monoidal structures are

being only braided, not symmetric. We propose coherence conditions for
distributivity in this situation, and we prove that our conditions are (a)
strong enough to imply Laplaza's when the latter are suitably formulated, and
(b) weak enough to hold when --- as in the categories used to model anyons ---
the additive structure is that of an abelian category and the braided $\otimes$

conditions.

Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility as the films are grown at 255 K
show power law scaling that is limited by noise at low deposition, and by the
dynamics of the paramagnetic, frustrated state at high deposition. Because the
measurements represent a system driven by a finite field oscillating at a
finite frequency, it is demonstated that the threshold deposition for
percolation is bounded by the depositions where the real and imaginary
components of the susceptibility have maxima. Fitting for the critical exponent
of the static susceptibility at these bounds gives a bounded value for
$\gamma_p=2.39\pm0.04$, in agreement with theory.

formalized by means of a sampling operator which takes into account both
deterministic and random samples and leads to discretized problems. We then
analyze the discretized problems and we study the convergence of their
solutions to the ones of the approximation problem in a RKHS, both in the
deterministic and statistical framework. Finally, we prove there exists a
relation between the convergence rates computed with respect to the noise level

compare upper and lower bounds given in the statistical learning and in the

generalized Pauli principle is derived: for an $N$-particles system exhibiting
FES of extended parameter $g=q/r$ ($q$ and $r$ are co-prime integers such that
$0 < q \leq r$), we found that the allowed occupation number of a state is
smaller than or equal to $r-q+1$ and \emph{not} to $1/g$ whenever $q\neq 1$
and, moreover, the global occupancy shape (merely represented by a partition of
$N$) is admissible if the number of states occupied by at least two particles
is less than or equal to $(N-1)/r$ ($N \equiv 1 \pmod r$). These counting rules
allow distinguishing infinitely many families of FES systems depending on the
parameter $g$ and the size $N$. As an application of the main result, we study
the probability distributions of occupancy configurations. For instance, the
number of occupied states is found to be a hypergeometric random variable.
Closed-form expressions for the expectation values and variances in the
thermodynamic limit are presented. By way of comparison, we obtain parallel
results regarding the Gentile intermediate statistics and demonstrate subtle
similarities and contrasts with respect to FES.

i-vectors for speaker recognition. Promising results have been recently
obtained with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when fed by raw speech
samples directly. Rather than employing standard hand-crafted features, the
latter CNNs learn low-level speech representations from waveforms, potentially
allowing the network to better capture important narrow-band speaker
characteristics such as pitch and formants. Proper design of the neural network
is crucial to achieve this goal. This paper proposes a novel CNN architecture,
called SincNet, that encourages the first convolutional layer to discover more
meaningful filters. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which
implement band-pass filters. In contrast to standard CNNs, that learn all
elements of each filter, only low and high cutoff frequencies are directly
learned from data with the proposed method. This offers a very compact and
efficient way to derive a customized filter bank specifically tuned for the
desired application. Our experiments, conducted on both speaker identification
and speaker verification tasks, show that the proposed architecture converges
faster and performs better than a standard CNN on raw waveforms.

to be overly extravagant, however, and algorithmic probability has also
provided improved models of subjective probability and Bayesian reasoning. I
attempt here to generalize algorithmic Everettianism to more Bayesian and
subjectivist interpretations. I present a general framework for applying
generative probability, of which algorithmic probability can be considered a
special case. I apply this framework to two commonly vexing thought experiments

requires massive storage to store signals at an applicable frequency rate. In
this work, we propose the EventRelated Potential Encoder Network (ERPENet); a
multi-task autoencoder-based model, that can be applied to any ERP-related
tasks. The strength of ERPENet lies in its capability to handle various kinds
of ERP datasets and its robustness across multiple recording setups, enabling
joint training across datasets. ERPENet incorporates Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), in an autoencoder setup,
which tries to simultaneously compress the input EEG signal and extract related
P300 features into a latent vector. Here, we can infer the process for
generating the latent vector as universal joint feature extraction. The network
also includes a classification part for attended and unattended events
classification as an auxiliary task. We experimented on six different P300
datasets. The results show that the latent vector exhibits better compression
capability than the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised autoencoder
model. For attended and unattended events classification, pre-trained weights
are adopted as initial weights and tested on unseen P300 datasets to evaluate
the adaptability of the model, which shortens the training process as compared
to using random Xavier weight initialization. At the compression rate of 6.84,
the classification accuracy outperforms conventional P300 classification
models: XdawnLDA, DeepConvNet, and EEGNet achieving 79.37% - 88.52%
classification accuracy depending on the dataset.

important expansion for solving the Boltzmann equation. However, the expansion
is divergent or indeterminant in the case of relaxation time $\tau \geq 1$.
Even since this divergence problem has puzzled this subject for a century. By
using a modified M\""obius series inversion formula, this paper proposes a
modified Chapman-Enskog expansion with a variable upper limit of the summation.
The new expansion can give not only a convergent summation but also provide the
best-so-far explanation on some unbelievable scenarios occurred in previous
practice.

controlled by the Bond number and the Galileo number, while the Bond number is
a key parameter within the solution. To avoid the poor rate of convergence of
Taylor's series solution, an approximate analytic solution was proposed, which
was verified numerically.

in an attempt to advance computational capabilities and energy efficiency in
today's datacenters. These architectures provide programmers with the ability
to reprogram the FPGAs for flexible acceleration of many workloads.
Nonetheless, this advantage is often overshadowed by the poor programmability
of FPGAs whose programming is conventionally a RTL design practice. Although
recent advances in high-level synthesis (HLS) significantly improve the FPGA
programmability, it still leaves programmers facing the challenge of
identifying the optimal design configuration in a tremendous design space.
  This paper aims to address this challenge and pave the path from software
programs towards high-quality FPGA accelerators. Specifically, we first propose
the composable, parallel and pipeline (CPP) microarchitecture as a template of
accelerator designs. Such a well-defined template is able to support efficient
accelerator designs for a broad class of computation kernels, and more
importantly, drastically reduce the design space. Also, we introduce an
analytical model to capture the performance and resource trade-offs among
different design configurations of the CPP microarchitecture, which lays the
foundation for fast design space exploration. On top of the CPP
microarchitecture and its analytical model, we develop the AutoAccel framework
to make the entire accelerator generation automated. AutoAccel accepts a
software program as an input and performs a series of code transformations
based on the result of the analytical-model-based design space exploration to
construct the desired CPP microarchitecture. Our experiments show that the
AutoAccel-generated accelerators outperform their corresponding software
implementations by an average of 72x for a broad class of computation kernels.

footprint with low operating voltage and hence low power dissipation, thus
lending themselves to on-chip integration of large-scale device arrays. Here we
demonstrate an electrical packaging concept that enables high-density
radio-frequency (RF) interfaces between on-chip SOH devices and external
circuits. The concept combines high-resolution $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$
printed-circuit boards with technically simple metal wire bonds and is amenable
to packaging of device arrays with small on-chip bond pad pitches. In a set of
experiments, we characterize the performance of the underlying RF building
blocks and we demonstrate the viability of the overall concept by generation of
high-speed optical communication signals. Achieving line rates (symbols rates)
of 128 Gbit/s (64 GBd) using quadrature-phase-shiftkeying (QPSK) modulation and
of 160 Gbit/s (40 GBd) using 16-state quadrature-amplitudemodulation (16QAM),
we believe that our demonstration represents an important step in bringing SOH
modulators from proof-of-concept experiments to deployment in commercial
environments.
