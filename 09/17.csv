various socio-cognitive spaces on the Web. Social machines are human
collectives using networked digital technology which initiate real-world
processes and activities including human communication, interactions and
knowledge creation. As such, they continuously emerge and fade on the Web. The
relationship between humans and machines is made more complex by the adoption
of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices. The scale, automation,
continuous sensing, and actuation capabilities of these devices add an extra
dimension to the relationship between humans and machines making it difficult
to understand their evolution at either the systemic or the conceptual level.
This article describes these new socio-technical systems, which we term
Cyber-Physical Social Machines, through different exemplars, and considers the
associated challenges of security and privacy.

in physics. We study a toy model for such systems where each time step is given
by multiplication with an independent random $N\times N$ matrix with complex
Gaussian elements, the complex Ginibre ensemble. This model allows to
explicitly compute the Lyapunov exponents and local correlations amongst them,
when the number of factors $M$ becomes large. While the smallest eigenvalues
always remain deterministic, which is also the case for many chaotic quantum
systems, we identify a critical double scaling limit $N\sim M$ for the rest of
the spectrum. It interpolates between the known deterministic behaviour of the
Lyapunov exponents for $M\gg N$ (or $N$ fixed) and universal random matrix
statistics for $M\ll N$ (or $M$ fixed), characterising chaotic behaviour. After
unfolding this agrees with Dyson's Brownian Motion starting from equidistant
positions in the bulk and at the soft edge of the spectrum. This universality
statement is further corroborated by numerical experiments, multiplying
different kinds of random matrices. It leads us to conjecture a much wider
applicability in complex systems, that display a transition from deterministic
to chaotic behaviour.

accumulation and concentration decay in the tissue space for different vascular
configurations. A comparison of a single capillary configuration (SBC) with two
parallel cylindrical blood vessels (2 BC) and a lymph vessel parallel to a
blood vessel (BC_LC) embedded in the tissue cylinder is performed for five
solute molecular weights between 0.1 kDa and 70 kDa. We found that the presence
of a second capillary reduces the extravascular concentration compared to a
single capillary and this reduction is enhanced by the presence of a lymph
vessel. Co-current flow direction between two adjacent vessels led to
nonhomogeneous nanoparticle distribution for larger particle sizes in the
tissue space, while smaller particles (0.1 kDa and 3 kDa) showed the propensity
to get trapped locally in the tissue during counter-current flow. Varying the
intercapillary distance with respect to vessel diameter shows a deviation of
10-30 % concentration for 2 BC and 45-60% concentration for BC_LC configuration
compared to the reference SBC configuration. Finally, we introduce a
non-dimensional time scale that captures the concertation as a function of the
transport and geometric parameters. We find that the peak solute concentration
in the tissue space occurs at a non-dimensional time, T_peak^* = 0.027+/-0.018,
irrespective of the solute size, tissue architecture, and microvessel flow
direction. This suggests that if indeed such a universal time scale holds, the
knowledge of this time would allow estimation of the time window at which

future therapeutic efficacy studies as an example for triggering drug release

long fibrous threads each ~ 10 cm in length. Hagfish release the threads in a
condensed coiled state known as thread cells, or skeins (~ 100 microns), which
must unravel within a fraction of a second to thwart a predator attack. Here we
consider the hypothesis that viscous hydrodynamics can be responsible for this
rapid unraveling, as opposed to chemical reaction kinetics alone. Our main
conclusion is that, under reasonable physiological conditions, unraveling due
to viscous drag can occur within a few hundred milliseconds, and is accelerated
if the skein is pinned at a surface such as the mouth of a predator. We model a
single thread cell unspooling as the fiber peels away due to viscous drag. We
capture essential features by considering one-dimensional scenarios where the
fiber is aligned with streamlines in either uniform flow or uniaxial
extensional flow. The peeling resistance is modeled with a power-law dependence
on peeling velocity. A dimensionless ratio of viscous drag to peeling
resistance appears in the dynamical equations and determines the unraveling
timescale. Our modeling approach is general and can be refined with future
experimental measurements of peel strength for skein unraveling. It provides
key insights into the unraveling process, offers potential answers to lingering
questions about slime formation from threads and mucous vesicles, and will aid
the growing interest in engineering similar bioinspired material systems.

considering the discrepancy between training and testing. At test time, a
language model is required to make predictions given past predictions as input,
instead of the past targets that are provided during training. This difference,
known as exposure bias, can lead to the compounding of errors along a generated
sequence at test time.
  In order to improve generalization in neural language models and address
compounding errors, we propose a curriculum learning based method that
gradually changes an initially deterministic teacher policy to a gradually more
stochastic policy, which we refer to as \textit{Nearest-Neighbor Replacement
Sampling}. A chosen input at a given timestep is replaced with a sampled
nearest neighbor of the past target with a truncated probability proportional
to the cosine similarity between the original word and its top $k$ most similar
words. This allows the teacher to explore alternatives when the teacher
provides a sub-optimal policy or when the initial policy is difficult for the
learner to model. The proposed strategy is straightforward, online and requires
little additional memory requirements. We report our main findings on two

diffusion, and may sometimes even exhibit counterintuitive behavior. In the
present work, taking Cu/Ni as a model system, a general phenomenon is reported
which results in sharpening of interfaces upon thermal annealing, even in
miscible systems. Anomalous x-ray reflectivity from a Cu/Ni multilayer has been
used to study the evolution of interfaces with thermal annealing. Annealing at
423 K results in sharpening of interfaces by about 38%. This is the temperature
at which no asymmetry exists in the inter-diffusivities of Ni and Cu. Thus, the
effect is very general in nature, and is different from the one reported in the
literature, which requires a large asymmetry in the diffusivities of the two
constituents [Z. Erd\'elyi et al., Science 306, 1913 (2004).]. General nature
of the effect is conclusively demonstrated using isotopic multilayers of
57Fe/naturalFe, in which evolution of isotopic interfaces has been observed
using nuclear resonance reflectivity. It is found that annealing at suitably
low temperature (e.g. 523 K) results in sharpening of the isotopic interfaces.
Since chemically it is a single Fe layer, any effect associated with
concentration dependent diffusivity can be ruled out. The results can be
understood in terms of fast diffusion along short-circuit paths like triple
junctions, which results in an effective sharpening of the interfaces at
relatively low temperatures.

through the entire dataset; and 2) non-iid data will cause catastrophic
forgetting. An old fix to both of these issues is rehearsal. To learn a new
example, rehearsal mixes it with previous examples, and then this mixture is
used to update the DNN. Full rehearsal is slow and memory intensive because it
stores all previously observed examples, and its effectiveness for preventing
catastrophic forgetting has not been studied in modern DNNs. Here, we describe
the ExStream algorithm for memory efficient rehearsal and compare it to
alternatives. We find that full rehearsal can eliminate catastrophic forgetting
in a variety of streaming learning settings, with ExStream performing well
using far less memory and computation.

non-trivial spatial topology. Meanwhile, anomalies in the observed CMB
temperature map, such as the lack of correlations at large angular separations,
remain observationally robust. We show that if our universe is flat and has one
compact dimension of appropriate size (slab topology), this would suppress
large-angle temperature correlations while maintaining a low-$\ell$ angular
power spectrum consistent with observations. The optimal length appears to be
$1.4$ times the conformal radius of the CMB's last scattering surface
($\chi_{rec}$). We construct the probability distribution function of the
statistic $S_{1/2}$ using simulated Sachs-Wolf-only skies for each of several
values of $L_z/\chi_{rec}$. For $L_z\simeq1.4\chi_{rec}$ the $p$-value of four
standard masked Planck maps is $p\simeq0.15$, compared to $p\lesssim0.003$ for
the conventional topologically trivial space. The mean angular power spectrum
$\langle C_{\ell} \rangle$ of the $L_z=1.4\chi_{rec}$ slab space matches the
observed power spectrum at $2\leq\ell\lesssim6$ -- including a substantially
suppressed quadrupole $C_2$, a slightly suppressed octopole $C_3$, and
unsuppressed higher multipoles. It does not predict other low-$\ell$ CMB
anomalies, and does not take account of normally sub-dominant Integrated Sachs
Wolfe contributions. An $L_z=1.4\chi_{rec}$ slab topology is consistent with
published limits from the Planck maps ($L_z\gtrsim1.12\chi_{rec}$). It is
within the 95% confidence range $1.2\leq L_z/\chi_{rec}\leq2.1$ inferred using
the covariance-matrix of temperature fluctuations. However, it violates
published circles-in-the-sky limits from WMAP and related unpublished limits
from Planck ($L_z/\chi_{rec}\gtrsim1.9$). We remark on the possibility to
satisfy these limits, and ""postdict"" other large-angle anomalies, with closely
related topologies.

all-flash storage systems have started to become more economically viable for
large shared storage installations in datacenters, where metrics like Total
Cost of Ownership (TCO) are of paramount importance. On the other hand, flash
devices suffer from write amplification, which, if unaccounted, can
substantially increase the TCO of a storage system. In this paper, we first
develop a TCO model for datacenter all-flash storage systems, and then plug a
Write Amplification model (WAF) of NVMe SSDs we build based on empirical data
into this TCO model. Our new WAF model accounts for workload characteristics
like write rate and percentage of sequential writes. Furthermore, using both
the TCO and WAF models as the optimization criterion, we design new flash
resource management schemes (MINTCO) to guide datacenter managers to make
workload allocation decisions under the consideration of TCO for SSDs. Based on
that, we also develop MINTCO-RAID to support RAID SSDs and MINTCO-OFFLINE to
optimize the offline workload-disk deployment problem during the initialization
phase. Experimental results show that MINTCO can reduce the TCO and keep
relatively high throughput and space utilization of the entire datacenter

stochastic perturbations, in terms of the interaction of magnetic moments with

  In the present work, the consequences of identifying the effects of
dissipation as resulting from interactions with a bath of spins are explored,
in addition to elastic, degrees of freedom. The corresponding stochastic
differential equations are solved numerically and the moments of the
magnetization are computed. The stochastic equations implicitly define a
measure on the space of spin configurations, whose moments at equal times
satisfy a hierarchy of deterministic, ordinary differential equations. Closure
assumptions are used to truncate the hierarchy and the same moments are
computed. We focus on the advantages and problems that each approach presents,
for the approach to equilibrium and, in particular, the emergence of
longitudinal damping.

required in advanced knowledge graphs. The logical core of the underlying
Vadalog language is the warded fragment of tuple-generating dependencies
(TGDs). This formalism ensures tractable reasoning in data complexity, while a
recent analysis focusing on a practical implementation led to the reasoning
algorithm around which the Vadalog system is built. A fundamental question that
has emerged in the context of Vadalog is the following: can we limit the
recursion allowed by wardedness in order to obtain a formalism that provides a
convenient syntax for expressing useful recursive statements, and at the same
time achieves space-efficiency? After analyzing several real-life examples of
warded sets of TGDs provided by our industrial partners, as well as recent
benchmarks, we observed that recursion is often used in a restricted way: the
body of a TGD contains at most one atom whose predicate is mutually recursive
with a predicate in the head. We show that this type of recursion, known as
piece-wise linear in the Datalog literature, is the answer to our main
question. We further show that piece-wise linear recursion alone, without the
wardedness condition, is not enough as it leads to the undecidability of
reasoning. We finally study the relative expressiveness of the query languages

special detection methods are used, all of which are based on the threshold

communication systems if the channel matrix that we introduce is full rank.
Also, for a 2$\times$1 system, we define an optimization problem to obtain the
suitable number of molecules for transmitting to reduce BER of this systems.
Then the proposed modulation is generalized to $2\times2$ and $4\times4$
systems. In each of these systems, special detection methods based on the
threshold level detection are used. Finally, based on BER, systems using MSM
are fairly compared to the systems that have similar data rates. The simulation

Items can be moved across edges while various constraints depending on the type

formulation that encompasses known types of item relocation problems such as
multi-agent path finding (MAPF) and token swapping (TSWAP). In this formulation
we express two new types of relocation problems derived from token swapping
that we call token rotation (TROT) and token permutation (TPERM). Our solving
approach for item relocation combines satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) with
conflict-based search (CBS). We interpret CBS in the SMT framework where we
start with the basic model and refine the model with a collision resolution
constraint whenever a collision between items occurs in the current solution.
The key difference between the standard CBS and our SMT-based modification of
CBS (SMT-CBS) is that the standard CBS branches the search to resolve the
collision while in SMT-CBS we iteratively add a single disjunctive collision
resolution constraint. Experimental evaluation on several benchmarks shows that
the SMT-CBS algorithm significantly outperforms the standard CBS. We also
compared SMT-CBS with a modification of the SAT-based MDD-SAT solver that uses
an eager modeling of item relocation in which all potential collisions are
eliminated by constrains in advance. Experiments show that lazy approach in
SMT-CBS produce fewer constraint than MDD-SAT and also achieves faster solving

  effect of finite and decoupled sources","58 pages, 39 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Naturally ventilated buildings harness freely-available resources such as
internal buoyancy gains and wind forcing in achieving comfortable interior
conditions. Although these resources are free, they are time-variable and can
be difficult to control. As a result of this the nonlinear interplay between
sometimes competing resources may lead to sub-optimal ventilation states. This
problem has been explored by a number of previous researches e.g. Flynn &
Caufield (Building and Environment, 44, 216-226, 2009) who, in studying these
ventilations states, demonstrated complicated transitions characterized by
hysteresis even for the simple case of a one-zone building. The objectives of
this research are to extend the previous (theoretical) analysis by conducting
complementary numerical experiments using sophisticated algorithms capable of
describing turbulent, buoyancy driven flow. A further objective of this study
is to specifically decouple the source, which was previously assumed to supply
both heat and mass to the interior space. Rather, the flow dynamics in a case
where heat and mass are supplied independently are examined.

data distribution to be a simple distribution, such as an isotropic Gaussian.
However, this causes the posterior collapse problem and loses manifold
structure which can be important for datasets such as facial images. A GAN can
transform a simple distribution to a latent-space data distribution and thus
preserve the manifold structure, but optimizing a GAN involves solving a
Min-Max optimization problem, which is difficult and not well understood so
far. Therefore, we propose a GAN-like method to transform a simple distribution
to a data distribution in the latent space by solving only a minimization
problem. This minimization problem comes from training a discriminator between
a simple distribution and a latent-space data distribution. Then, we can
explicitly formulate an Optimal Transport (OT) problem that computes the
desired mapping between the two distributions. This means that we can transform
a distribution without solving the difficult Min-Max optimization problem.
Experimental results on an eight-Gaussian dataset show that the proposed OT can
handle multi-cluster distributions. Results on the MNIST and the CelebA
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

image or the object of interests to corrupt CNN based object detectors. In this
paper, we focus on exploring the vulnerability of the Single Shot Module (SSM)
commonly used in recent object detectors, by adding small perturbations to
patches in the background outside the object. The SSM is referred to the Region
Proposal Network used in a two-stage object detector or the single-stage object
detector itself. The SSM is typically a fully convolutional neural network
which generates output in a single forward pass. Due to the excessive
convolutions used in SSM, the actual receptive field is larger than the object
itself. As such, we propose a novel method to corrupt object detectors by
generating imperceptible patches only in the background. Our method can find a
few background patches for perturbation, which can effectively decrease true
positives and dramatically increase false positives. Efficacy is demonstrated
on 5 two-stage object detectors and 8 single-stage object detectors on the MS
COCO 2014 dataset. Results indicate that perturbations with small distortions
outside the bounding box of object region can still severely damage the
detection performance.

Data sets often have significant omissions due to individuals dropping out of
experiments, errors in data collection, image corruptions, and so on. Missing
data could potentially undermine the validity of research results - leading to
inaccurate predictive models and misleading conclusions. Imputation - a
relatively flexible, general purpose approach towards dealing with missing data
- is now available in massive numbers, making it possible to handle missing
data. While these estimation methods are becoming increasingly more effective
in resolving the discrepancies between true and estimated values, its effect on
clustering outcomes is largely disregarded.
  This study seeks to reveal the vast differences in agglomerative hierarchal
clustering outcomes estimation methods can construct in comparison to the
precision exhibited (presented through the cophenetic correlation coefficient)
in comparison to their high efficiency and effectivity in value preservation of
true and imputed values (presented through the root-mean-squared error). We
argue against the traditional approach towards the development of imputation
methods and instead, advocate towards methods that reproduce a data set's
original, natural cluster.
  By using a number of advanced imputation methods, we reveal extensive
differences between original and reconstructed clusters that could
significantly transform the interpretations of the data as a whole.

essential parameter of semiconductors for optoelectronic applications, the
understanding why some of the conventional semiconductors have direct or
indirect bandgaps remains ambiguous. In this Letter, we revealed that the
existence of the occupied cation d bands is a prime element in determining the
directness of the bandgap of semiconductors through the s-d and p-d couplings,
which push the conduction band energy levels at the X- and L-valley up, but
leaves the {\Gamma}-valley conduction state unchanged. This unified theory
unambiguously explains why Diamond, Si, Ge, and Al-containing group III-V
semiconductors, which do not have active occupied d bands, have indirect
bandgaps and remaining common semiconductors, except GaP, have direct bandgaps.
Besides s-d and p-d couplings, bond length and electronegativity of anions are
two remaining factors regulating the energy ordering of the {\Gamma}-, X-, and
L-valley of the conduction band, and are responsible for the anomalous bandgap
behaviors in GaN, GaP, and GaAs that have direct, indirect, and direct
bandgaps, respectively, despite the fact that N, P, and As are in ascending
order of the atomic number. This understanding will shed light on the design of
new direct bandgap light-emitting materials.

fewer multiply-accumulate operations than several tested state-of-the-art

particular, common binary representations are learned by exploiting both
sharable and individual information across multiple views to capture their
underlying correlations. Meanwhile, cluster assignment with robust binary
centroids is also performed via effective discrete optimization under L21-norm

computations can be successfully reduced by efficient binary XOR operations
during the clustering procedure. To our best knowledge, HSIC is the first

classes seen in testing must have been seen in training. However, in the
dynamic world, new or unseen class examples may appear constantly. A model
working in such an environment must be able to reject unseen classes (not seen
or used in training). If enough data is collected for the unseen classes, the
system should incrementally learn to accept/classify them. This learning
paradigm is called open-world learning (OWL). Existing OWL methods all need
some form of re-training to accept or include the new classes in the overall
model. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning approach to the problem. Its
key novelty is that it only needs to train a meta-classifier, which can then
continually accept new classes when they have enough labeled data for the
meta-classifier to use, and also detect/reject future unseen classes. No
re-training of the meta-classifier or a new overall classifier covering all old
and new classes is needed. In testing, the method only uses the examples of the
seen classes (including the newly added classes) on-the-fly for classification
and rejection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
approach.

problems where the objective function is encoded by multiple local and possibly
nonsmooth objectives privately held by a group of agents, and propose a
distributed subgradient method with double averaging (abbreviated as ${\rm
DSA_2}$) that only requires peer-to-peer communication and local computation to
solve the global problem. The algorithmic framework builds on dual methods and
dynamic average consensus; the sequence of test points is formed by iteratively
minimizing a local dual model of the overall objective where the coefficients,
i.e., approximated subgradients of the objective, are supplied by the dynamic
average consensus scheme. We theoretically show that ${\rm DSA_2}$ enjoys
non-ergodic convergence properties, i.e., the local minimizing sequence itself
is convergent, a distinct feature that cannot be found in existing results.
Specifically, we establish a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$ in
terms of objective function error. Then, extensions are made to tackle
distributed optimization problems with coupled functional constraints by
combining ${\rm DSA_2}$ and dual decomposition. This is made possible by
Lagrangian relaxation that transforms the coupling in constraints of the primal
problem into that in cost functions of the dual, thus allowing us to solve the
dual problem via ${\rm DSA_2}$. Both the dual objective error and the quadratic
penalty for the coupled constraint are proved to converge at a rate of
$O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$, and the primal objective error asymptotically
vanishes. Numerical experiments and comparisons are conducted to illustrate the
advantage of the proposed algorithms and validate our theoretical findings.

However, the relevant research results are scarce due to the lack of
computationally tractable analytic DPSD solutions. To fill this gap, we
investigate an indirect method for the DPSD analysis of a generic
two-dimensional (2D) RSS model for V2V channels. The indirect method, based on
the Hoeher's theorem, employs successive transformations of random variables to
obtain the DPSD. Compared to the conventional methods, leading to impractical
multiple integral solutions, our method yields a single integral-form, more
useful for analytic studies, model validation/parameter estimation, and fading
simulator design. Using the new DPSD solution, the impact of different RSS
layouts on the DPSD characteristics is further investigated, and several new
insights are provided. The joint probability density function (PDF) of
angle-of-departure and angle-of-arrival (AoA) and the joint Doppler-AoA PDF are
newly presented in closed-forms and analyzed with respect to the DPSD shape.
Comparisons with the DPSDs measured in highway and \FB{urban canyon}

available in various real-world applications and those data are usually highly
heterogeneous. Taking computational medicine as an example, we have both
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical images for each patient. For
complicated diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, both EHR and
neuroimaging information are very important for disease understanding because
they contain complementary aspects of the disease. However, EHR and neuroimage
are completely different. So far the existing research has been mainly focusing
on one of them. In this paper, we proposed a framework, Memory-Based Graph
Convolution Network (MemGCN), to perform integrative analysis with such
multi-modal data. Specifically, GCN is used to extract useful information from
the patients' neuroimages. The information contained in the patient EHRs before
the acquisition of each brain image is captured by a memory network because of
its sequential nature. The information contained in each brain image is
combined with the information read out from the memory network to infer the
disease state at the image acquisition timestamp. To further enhance the
analytical power of MemGCN, we also designed a multi-hop strategy that allows
multiple reading and updating on the memory can be performed at each iteration.
We conduct experiments using the patient data from the Parkinson's Progression
Markers Initiative (PPMI) with the task of classification of Parkinson's
Disease (PD) cases versus controls. We demonstrate that superior classification
performance can be achieved with our proposed framework, comparing with
existing approaches involving a single type of data.

cyber-physical systems---the case of a discrete-time, linear, time-invariant
plant that may be subject to an attack that overrides the sensor readings and
the controller actions. The attacker attempts to learn the dynamics of the
plant and subsequently override the controller's actuation signal, to destroy
the plant without being detected. The attacker can feed fictitious sensor
readings to the controller using its estimate of the plant dynamics and mimic
the legitimate plant operation. The controller, on the other hand, is
constantly on the lookout for an attack; once the controller detects an attack,
it immediately shuts the plant off. In the case of scalar plants, we derive an
upper bound on the attacker's deception probability for any measurable control
policy when the attacker uses an arbitrary learning algorithm to estimate the
system dynamics. We then derive lower bounds for the attacker's deception
probability for both scalar and vector plants by assuming a specific
authentication test that inspects the empirical variance of the system
disturbance. We also show how the controller can improve the security of the
system by superimposing a carefully crafted privacy-enhancing signal on top of
the ""nominal control policy."" Finally, for nonlinear scalar dynamics that
belong to the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), we investigate the

high dimensions. Our proposal estimates the subspace of the linear combinations
of the covariates directly and performs variable selection simultaneously. We
solve the resulting convex optimization problem via the linearized alternating
direction methods of multiplier algorithm, and establish an upper bound on the
subspace distance between the estimated and the true subspaces. Through
numerical studies, we show that our proposal is able to identify the correct

significantly above the main sequence. On the other hand, `starburst galaxies'
are not necessarily associated with merger episodes, especially at the low-mass
end. Galaxies that experienced recent mergers can have relatively low levels of
star formation when/if the merger is gas-poor, and galaxies with no recent
merger can experience episodes of starbursts due to a combination of large
amount of cold gas available from cooling/accretion events and/or small disk
radii which increases the cold gas surface density.

world's major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that
previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by
high-speed autonomous automated trading systems. Research aimed at
understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by
the fact that no operational real-world exchange is ever likely to allow
experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing
researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data. Similarly,
university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation

by using degrees of freedom of different nature. There are different kinds of
dualities and they have been extremely useful to uncover the underlying strong
coupling dynamics of gauge theories in various dimensions and those of the
diverse string theories. Perhaps the oldest example exhibiting this property is
Maxwell theory, which interchanges electric and magnetic fields. An extension
of this duality involving the sources is also possible if the magnetic monopole
is incorporated. At the present time a lot has been understood about duality in
non-Abelian gauge theories as in the case of N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories
in four dimensions or in the Seiberg-Witten duality for N=2 theories. Moreover,
a duality that relates a gravitational theory (or a string theory) and a
conformal gauge theory, as in the case of gauge/gravity correspondence, have
been also studied with considerable detail. The case of duality between two
gravitational theories is the so called gravitational duality. At the present
time, this duality has not been exhaustively studied, however some advances
have been reported in the literature. In the present paper we give a general
overview of this subject. In particular we will focus on non-Abelian dualities,
applied to various theories of gravity as developed by the authors, based in
the Rocek-Verlinde duality procedure. Finally, as a new development in this

aircraft and ground terminals, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) based L-band (960-1164MHz) Digital Aeronautical Communication System
(LDACS) has been recently proposed as an alternative to existing narrowband
systems. However, OFDM based LDACS needs additional control signaling for time
and frequency alignment and the use of cyclic prefix and high out-of-band
emission limits the spectrum utilization efficiency to less than 50%. In this
paper, a new waveform has been proposed which offers better spectrum
utilization than OFDM without compromising on computational complexity and
interference to legacy users in L-band. It also allows transceivers to
dynamically adapt the transmission bandwidth to meet the desired quality of
service. Since the proposed waveform employs a reconfigurable multiband linear
phase filter, it is referred to as reconfigurable filtered OFDM (Ref-OFDM).
Simulation results and extensive analysis show that the proposed Ref-OFDM
offers around 40 dB better out-of-band emission than OFDM which in turn leads
to significant increase in the transmission bandwidth for a given BER and
interference constraints. The computational complexity of Ref-OFDM is slightly
higher than that of OFDM but it is significantly less than other waveforms
making Ref-OFDM an attractive waveform for next generation air-to-ground
communications. An end to end hardware prototyping of LDACS-DME coexistence is
also presented in this report.

However, when the CMDs are not available, the Spectral Energy Distribution

age-metallicity-reddening degeneracy. In this work, we gather the ages,
metallicities and masses of dozens of M31 star clusters from the CMD-fitting
with HST images from the literatures for comparison. We check the reliability
of the SED-fitting results with different models, i.e., Bruzual \& Charlot 2003

Stellar Population Synthesis (ASPS) for the simple stellar populations (SSPs)

includes the Galaxy Evolution Explorer {\sl GALEX} FUV/NUV bands,
optical/near-infrared $UBVRIJHK$ bands, as well as the Wide-field Infrared

SED-fitting ages agree well with the CMD-fitting ages, either with the fixed
metallicity or with the free metallicity for both the BC03 and the {\sl GALEV}

systematic older than the CMD ages, especially for the ages log t <9.0 (yr).
The fitting also shows that the {\sl GALEX} FUV/NUV-band are more important
than the {\sl WISE} $W1$/$W2$ for constraining the ages, which confirms the
previous findings. We also derived the masses of our sample star clusters from
the BC03 and {\sl GALEV} models and it is found that the values agree well with

surfaces from coarse polygonal meshes---has become an indispensable production
instrument. Although subdivision performance is crucial during simulation,
animation and rendering, state-of-the-art approaches still rely on serial
implementations for complex parts of the subdivision process. Therefore, they
often fail to harness the power of modern parallel devices, like the graphics
processing unit (GPU), for large parts of the algorithm and must resort to
time-consuming serial preprocessing. In this paper, we show that a complete
parallelization of the subdivision process for modern architectures is
possible. Building on sparse matrix linear algebra, we show how to structure
the complete subdivision process into a sequence of algebra operations. By
restructuring and grouping these operations, we adapt the process for different
use cases, such as regular subdivision of dynamic meshes, uniform subdivision
for immutable topology, and feature-adaptive subdivision for efficient
rendering of animated models. As the same machinery is used for all use cases,
identical subdivision results are achieved in all parts of the production
pipeline. As a second contribution, we show how these linear algebra
formulations can effectively be translated into efficient GPU kernels. Applying
our strategies to $\sqrt{3}$, Loop and Catmull-Clark subdivision shows
significant speedups of our approach compared to state-of-the-art solutions,

reconsider and change their opinions if and only if they find themselves at the
extremes of the range of ideological positions held by members of the society.
Extremist agents are erratic: they become either more radical, and move away
from the positions of other agents, with probability $\varepsilon$, or more
moderate, and move towards the positions held by peers, with probability $(1 -
\varepsilon)$. The change in the opinion of the extremists is one unit on the
real line. We prove that the agent positions cluster in time, with all
non-extremist agents located within a unit interval. However, the consensus
opinion is dynamic. Due to the extremists' erratic behavior the clustered
opinion set performs a ""sluggish"" random walk on the entire range of possible
ideological positions (the real line). The inertia of the group, the reluctance
of the society's agents to change their consensus opinion, increases with the
size of the group. The extremists perform biased random walk excursions to the
right and left and, in time, their actions succeed to move the society of
agents in random directions. The ""far left"" agent effectively pushes the group
consensus toward the right, while the ""far right"" agent counter-balances the
push and causes the consensus to move toward the left.

by the fluctuations propagating towards the compact object. Observations
suggest the light curves in different energy bands are connected, but the
fluctuations at harder energies are delayed with respect to the softer ones.
The standard interpretation involves dependence of the X-ray spectral hardness
on the radial distance, with harder spectra emitted closer to the black hole.
Recently, a number of challenges to this scenario have been found, both at
qualitative and quantitative level. The model does not predict the large
magnitude of the delay between different energies, as well as the dependence of
variability amplitude on the spectral range and frequency. We study timing
properties of accreting black hole X-ray binaries taking into account
peculiarities of spectral formation in these sources. We show that the
simultaneous presence of two components leads to a complex shape of power
spectra and phase lags between the X-ray bands: the amplitude of the phase lag
becomes independent of the delay between the components, and the power spectra
show an artificial decrease or, on the contrary, enhancement of power at low
Fourier frequencies. This provides an essential ingredient for the
reinstatement of the propagating fluctuations model. The work draws attention

independent network evolution mechanisms: triadic closure and homophily. While
it is common to consider these mechanisms separately or in the frame of a
static model, empirical studies suggest that their dynamic interplay is the
very process responsible for the homophilous patterns of association seen in
off- and online social networks. By combining these two mechanisms in a minimal
solvable dynamic model, we confirm theoretically the long-held and empirically
established hypothesis that homophily can be amplified by the triadic closure
mechanism. This research approach allows us to estimate how much of the
observed homophily in various friendship and communication networks is due to
amplification for a given amount of triadic closure. We find that the
cumulative advantage-like process leading to homophily amplification can, under
certain circumstances, also lead to the widely documented core-periphery
structure of social networks, as well as to the emergence of memory of previous
homophilic constraints (equivalent to hysteresis phenomena in physics). The

possibilities of attaining a realistic covalent functionalization of the 2D
material have been examined via DFT solid state calculations. The distribution
of neighbor P atoms at one side of the sheet and the reciprocal
directionalities of their lone pairs must be clearly understood to foreshadow
the best possible acceptor reactants. Amongst the latter, the main group BH3 or
I2 species have been examined for their intrinsic acidity, which favors the
periodic mono-hapto anchoring at Pn atoms. The corresponding adducts are
systematically compared with other molecular P donors from a phosphine to white
phosphorus, P4. Significant variations emerge from the comparison of the band
gaps in the adducts and the naked phosphorene with a possible electronic
interpretation being offered. Then, the Pn covalent functionalization has been
analyzed in relation to unsaturated metal fragments, which, by carrying one,
two or three vacant sigma hybrids, may interact with a different number of
adjacent P atoms. For the modelling, the concept of isolobal analogy is
important for predicting the possible sets of external coligands at the metal,

configurations. Notably, a two-layer network representation can fully model the
underlying adaptive, state-dependent contact network. Contact adaptation
influences the size of the disease prevalence and the epidemic threshold---a
characteristic measure of a contact network robustness against epidemics---in a
nonlinear fashion. Particularly, the epidemic threshold for the presented
adaptive contact network belongs to the solution of a nonlinear

for the operation of islanded microgrids with very high share of renewable
energy sources. The proposed scheme mitigates the effect of errors in the
determination of the probability distribution of renewable infeed and load.
This allows to use less complex and less accurate forecasting methods and to
formulate low-dimensional scenario-based optimisation problems which are
suitable for control applications. Additionally, the designer may trade
performance for safety by interpolating between the conventional stochastic and
worst-case MPC formulations. The presented risk-averse MPC problem is
formulated as a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic problem and
its favourable characteristics are demonstrated in a case study. This includes
a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the robustness to load and renewable
power prediction errors.

which tells whether we can steer a system from an initial state to any final

accomplish the control in practice at the minimum cost, we must study how much
control energy is needed to reach the desired final state. At a given control
distance between the initial and final states, existing results present the
scaling behavior of lower bounds of the minimum energy in terms of the control
time analytically. However, to reach an arbitrary final state at a given
control distance, the minimum energy is actually dominated by the upper bound,
whose analytic expression still remains elusive. Here we theoretically show the
scaling behavior of the upper bound of the minimum energy in terms of the time
required to achieve control. Apart from validating the analytical results with
numerical simulations, our findings are feasible to the scenario with any

Moreover, more precise analytical results for the lower bound of the minimum

to decide, for each voxel, whether it is photo-consistent or not. Even so, this
method is widely used because of its simplicity and low computational cost. We
have returned to this method in order to propose an improvement in the
thresholding step which will be fully automated. Indeed, the geometrical
information is implicitly integrated using an hysteresis thresholding which
takes into account the spatial coherence of color voxels. Moreover, the
ambiguity of choosing the thresholds is extremely minimized by defining a fuzzy
degree of membership of each voxel into the class of consistent voxels. Also,
there is no need for preset thresholds since the hysteresis ones are defined
automatically and adaptively depending on the number of images that the voxel
isprojected onto. Preliminary results are very promising and demonstrate that
the proposed method performs automatically precise and smooth volumetric scene

inelastic Boltzmann kinetic equation for inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). The
mixture is driven by a thermostat constituted by two terms: a stochastic force
and a drag force proportional to the particle velocity. The combined action of
both forces attempts to mimic the interaction of solid particles with the
interstitial surrounding gas. As with ordinary gases, the use of IMM allows us
to exactly evaluate the velocity moments of the Boltzmann collision operator
and so, it opens up the possibility of obtaining the exact forms of the
Navier--Stokes transport coefficients of the granular mixture. In this work,
the diffusion coefficients associated with the mass flux are explicitly
determined in terms of the parameters of the mixture. As a first step, the
steady homogeneous state reached by the system when the energy lost by
collisions is compensated for by the energy injected by the thermostat is
addressed. In this steady state, the ratio of kinetic temperatures are
determined and compared against molecular dynamics simulations for inelastic
hard spheres (IHS). The comparison shows an excellent agreement, even for
strong inelasticity and/or disparity in masses and diameters. As a second step,
the set of kinetic equations for the mixture is solved by means of the
Chapman-Enskog method for states near homogeneous steady states. In the
first-order approximation, the mass flux is obtained and the corresponding
diffusion transport coefficients identified. The results show that the
predictions for IMM obtained in this work coincide with those previously
derived for IHS in the first-Sonine approximation when the non-Gaussian
corrections to the zeroth-order approximation are neglected.

northern edge of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMCNOD). We exploited variable
stars from the fourth release of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment
(OGLE). We used mainly pulsating variable stars and investigated their
potential association with the SMCNOD using their spatial distribution and
distances. We found four rather spatially concentrated anomalous Cepheids and
eight evenly dispersed RR~Lyrae stars to be most likely members of this
overdensity. The anomalous Cepheids inside the SMCNOD trace possible
intermediate-age population with ages ranging between $2-4.5$ Gyr. The age
distribution of anomalous Cepheids seems to be in a good agreement with the age
distribution of anomalous Cepheids in the SMC. Using empirical relations for
RR~Lyrae stars we determined the median metallicity for a possible old
population in the SMCNOD to be $\rm [Fe/H]_{\rm SMCNOD}=-1.71\pm0.21$ dex,
which is in agreement with median metallicity of the old SMC population. The
density profile for anomalous Cepheids shows a small anomaly at the position of
the SMCNOD, on the other hand, RR~Lyrae variables show no such deviation. The
probability of finding the observed number of variable stars at the location of
the SMCNOD by chance is very low for anomalous Cepheids (0.7 %) but high for
RR~Lyrae stars (13.0 %). Based on its variable stars content, we thus confirm
the presence of a modest overdensity in intermediate-age stars in the SMCNOD
and conclude that it probably has its origin in the SMC rather than to be the
remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy.

evolution in timing properties across observations. We show that neutron star
LMXBs follow a remarkably similar power spectral evolution to black hole LMXBs,

follow a similar clear track in the power colour-colour diagram as they
transition from the hard through soft states. Quantifying the position on this
oval track using a single parameter, the power-spectral `hue', we find that the
transition in X-ray spectral shape occurs at the same hue for both neutron star

The benefit of the finite horizon can be maintained by the searchers tuning

dependence concept. We investigate several sufficient conditions and we provide
a necessary condition for a copula to be minimal: The sufficient conditions are
related to the extreme negative dependence concept of d-countermonotonicity and
the necessary condition is related to the collection of all copulas minimizing
multivariate Kendall's tau. The concept of minimal copulas has already been
proved to be useful in various continuous and concordance order preserving
optimization problems including variance minimization and the detection of
lower bounds for certain measures of concordance. We substantiate this key role
of minimal copulas by showing that every continuous and concordance order
preserving functional on copulas is minimized by some minimal copula and, in
the case the continuous functional is even strictly concordance order
preserving, it is minimized by minimal copulas only. Applying the above
results, we may conclude that every minimizer of Spearman's rho is also a

spin-orbital coupling (SOC), the $p$-wave pairing occurs between equal-spin
electrons, and is chiral and two-fold degenerate. The chiral state supports
in-gap edge states, even though the low energy bands in the SC state are
topologically trivial. The absence of mirror symmetry allows Rashba SOC that
couples unequal spins, but we find its effect is of very high order, and can
only drive the chiral $p$-wave into helical $p$-wave deep in the SC state.
Interestingly, there is a six-fold degeneracy in the helical states, reflected
by the relative phase angle $\theta=n\pi/3$ (for integer $n$) between the spin

possibility of accurate electron density calculations of systems in realistic
physico-chemical conditions. In this paper, we present a strategy aimed at
performing a first-principle computation of the low energy part of the X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) spectrum based on the density functional theory
calculation of the electronic potential. To test its effectiveness we apply the
method to the computation of the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure part of
the XAS spectrum in the paradigmatic, but simple case of Cu2+ in water. In
order to keep into account the effect of the metal site structure fluctuations
in determining the experimental signal, the theoretical spectrum is evaluated
as the average over the computed spectra of a statistically significant number
of simulated metal site configurations. The comparison of experimental data
with theoretical calculations suggests that Cu2+ lives preferentially in a
square-pyramidal geometry. The remarkable success of this approach in the
interpretation of XAS data makes us optimistic about the possibility of
extending the computational strategy we have outlined to the more interesting
case of molecules of biological relevance bound to transition metal ions.

that spans all the vertices in the graph. It is known from \cite{muller,garey}

multiphase flow in pipelines described by the one-dimensional two-fluid model.
The methodology is based on 'half-explicit' Runge-Kutta methods, being explicit
for the mass and momentum equations and implicit for the volume constraint.
These half-explicit methods are constraint-consistent, i.e., they satisfy the
hidden constraints of the two-fluid model, namely the volumetric flow
(incompressibility) constraint and the Poisson equation for the pressure. A
novel analysis shows that these hidden constraints are present in the
continuous, semi-discrete, and fully discrete equations.
  Next to constraint-consistency, the new methods are conservative: the
original mass and momentum equations are solved, and the proper shock
conditions are satisfied; efficient: the implicit constraint is rewritten into
a pressure Poisson equation, and the time step for the explicit part is
restricted by a CFL condition based on the convective wave speeds; and
accurate: achieving high order temporal accuracy for all solution components
(masses, velocities, and pressure). High-order accuracy is obtained by
constructing a new third order Runge-Kutta method that satisfies the additional
order conditions arising from the presence of the constraint in combination
with time-dependent boundary conditions.
  Two test cases (Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in a pipeline and liquid
sloshing in a cylindrical tank) show that for time-independent boundary
conditions the half-explicit formulation with a classic fourth-order
Runge-Kutta method accurately integrates the two-fluid model equations in time
while preserving all constraints. A third test case (ramp-up of gas production
in a multiphase pipeline) shows that our new third order method is preferred
for cases featuring time-dependent boundary conditions.

Filtering, recent research has created an extensive collection of such

that such alternative representations can be used to replace standard

propose a novel procedure specially designed for Collaborative Filtering

extracts distributed representations using graph2vec. Experimental results show
that the proposed procedure creates representations that are competitive with

effectiveness to the use of instance weights. Proper selection of the instance
weights can lead to increased generalization performance. In this work, we
extend the span error bound theory to weighted SVM and we introduce effective
hyperparameter selection methods for the weighted SVM algorithm. The
significance of the presented work is that enables the application of span
bound and span-rule with weighted SVM. The span bound is an upper bound of the
leave-one-out error that can be calculated using a single trained SVM model.
This is important since leave-one-out error is an almost unbiased estimator of
the test error. Similarly, the span-rule gives the actual value of the
leave-one-out error. Thus, one can apply span bound and span-rule as
computationally lightweight alternatives of leave-one-out procedure for
hyperparameter selection. The main theoretical contributions are: (a) we prove
the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the span of a
support vector in weighted SVM; and (b) we prove the extension of span bound

Herschel-Bulkley form $\sigma = \sigma_y+c\text{Wi}^\nu$ with exponent

the Johnson-Samwer law $\Delta\sigma\sim T_s^{2/3}$, where temperature $T_s$ is
exclusively due to shear-induced vibrations. During flow particles prefer to
rotate around each other such that the dominant velocities are directed
tangentially to the particle surfaces. This tangential channel of energy
dissipation and its suppression leads to a discontinuity in the flow curve, and
an associated discontinuous shear thinning transition. We set up an analogy

for registration was supervised using predefined example registrations.
However, obtaining example registrations is not trivial. To circumvent the need

intensity-based image registration. After a ConvNet has been trained with the

We propose flexible ConvNets designs for affine image registration and for
deformable image registration. By stacking multiple of these ConvNets into a
larger architecture, we are able to perform coarse-to-fine image registration.
We show for registration of cardiac cine MRI and registration of chest CT that
performance of the DLIR framework is comparable to conventional image

logistic regression (a fully connected layer followed with softmax and cross
entropy loss), which is widely used in deep neural network (DNN) models for
classification problems. As logistic regression is widely known not having a
closed-form solution, it is usually randomly initialized, leading to several
deficiencies especially in transfer learning where all the layers except for
the last task-specific layer are initialized using a pre-trained model. The
deficiencies include slow convergence speed, possibility of stuck in local
minimum, and the risk of over-fitting. To address those deficiencies, we first
study the properties of logistic regression and propose a closed-form
approximate solution named regularized Gaussian classifier (RGC). Then we adopt
this approximate solution to initialize the task-specific linear layer and
demonstrate superior performance over random initialization in terms of both
accuracy and convergence speed on various tasks and datasets. For example, for
image classification, our approach can reduce the training time by 10 times and
achieve 3.2% gain in accuracy for Flickr-style classification. For object
detection, our approach can also be 10 times faster in training for the same
accuracy, or 5% better in terms of mAP for VOC 2007 with slightly longer

(special, high-degree, tower). The best algorithms in small characteristic
finite fields (e.g., {GF}$(3^{6 \cdot 509})$) are the Function Field Sieve,
Joux's algorithm, and the quasipolynomial-time algorithm. The last step of this
family of algorithms is the individual logarithm computation. It computes a
smooth decomposition of a given target in two phases: an initial splitting,
then a descent tree. While new improvements have been made to reduce the
complexity of the dominating relation collection and linear algebra steps,
resulting in a smaller factor basis (database of known logarithms of small
elements), the last step remains at the same level of difficulty. Indeed, we
have to find a smooth decomposition of a typically large element in the finite
field. This work improves the initial splitting phase and applies to any
nonprime finite field. It is very efficient when the extension degree is
composite. It exploits the proper subfields, resulting in a much more smooth
decomposition of the target. This leads to a new trade-off between the initial
splitting step and the descent step in small characteristic. Moreover it
reduces the width and the height of the subsequent descent tree.

Recently, there have been many attempts to apply deep learning to various

order to learn deep network model to be well-behaved in bio-image computing
fields, a lot of labeled data is required. However, in many bioimaging fields,
the large-size of labeled dataset is scarcely available. Although a few
researches have been dedicated to solving this problem through generative

seem realistic; 2) the variation of generated bio-image is limited; and 3)
additional label annotation task is needed. In this study, we propose a
realistic labeled bio-image generation method through visual feature processing
in latent space. Experimental results have shown that mass images generated by
the proposed method were realistic and had wide expression range of targeted

the Riemann $\zeta(s)$ function: they both have series representations and
satisfy an Euler product representation, i.e. an infinite product taken over
prime numbers. In this paper we address the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis
relative to the non-trivial complex zeros of the Dirichlet $L$ functions by
studying the possibility to enlarge the original domain of convergence of their
Euler product. The feasibility of this analytic continuation is ruled by the
asymptotic behavior in $N$ of the series $B_N = \sum_{n=1}^N \cos \bigl( t \log
p_n - \arg \chi (p_n) \bigr)$ involving Dirichlet characters $\chi$ modulo $q$
on primes $p_n$. Although deterministic, these series have pronounced
stochastic features which make them analogous to random time series. We show
that the $B_N$'s satisfy various normal law probability distributions. The
study of their large asymptotic behavior poses an interesting problem of
statistical physics equivalent to the Single Brownian Trajectory Problem, here
addressed by defining an appropriate ensemble $\mathcal{E}$ involving intervals
of primes. For non-principal characters, we show that the series $B_N$ present
a universal diffusive random walk behavior $B_N = O(\sqrt{N})$ in view of the
Dirichlet theorem on the equidistribution of reduced residue classes modulo $q$
and the Lemke Oliver-Soundararajan conjecture on the distribution of pairs of
residues on consecutive primes. This purely diffusive behavior of $B_N$ implies
that the domain of convergence of the infinite product representation of the
Dirichlet $L$-functions for non-principal characters can be extended from
$\Re(s) > 1$ down to $\Re (s) = \frac{1}{2}$, without encountering any zeros
before reaching this critical line.

derive a closed-form expression for the associated Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on

their opening angles lie in a narrow range: from 20 deg to 43 deg with smaller
X-shaped structures appearing to follow a characteristic opening angle ~ 27 deg
- 31 deg. We use self-consistent numerical simulations to uncover what
parameters of host galaxies govern the opening angle spread. We constructed a
series of equilibrium models of galaxies with high spatial resolution, varying
the dark halo and bulge contribution in the overall gravitational potential,
the initial disc thickness of models and the Toomre parameter Q and followed
their evolution for almost 8 Gyrs. Each model demonstrated the formation of
clear X-structures with different flatness. We have obtained that opening
angles lie in the range from 25 deg to 42 deg throughout the entire evolution.
These values are roughly consistent with observational data. The greatest
variation in the opening angles is obtained by varying the mass of the dark
halo. The initial thickness of the disc and the Toomre parameter are
responsible for smaller variations of the angle and shorter X-structures. An
increase of both parameters changes the morphology of in-plane bars and
X-structures. In some cases we observed even double X-structures. The main
effect of the bulge is to prevent buckling at intermediate and late stages of

NP-complete Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). The goal in
sparsification is to reduce the number of constraints in a problem instance

constraints can be given in terms of the number of variables n. We investigate
how the worst-case sparsification size depends on the types of constraints
allowed in the problem formulation (the constraint language). Two algorithmic
results are presented. The first result essentially shows that for any arity k,
the only constraint type for which no nontrivial sparsification is possible has
exactly one falsifying assignment, and corresponds to logical OR (up to
negations). Our second result concerns linear sparsification, that is, a
reduction to an equivalent instance with O(n) constraints. Using linear algebra
over rings of integers modulo prime powers, we give an elegant necessary and
sufficient condition for a constraint type to be captured by a degree-1
polynomial over such a ring, which yields linear sparsifications. The
combination of these algorithmic results allows us to prove two
characterizations that capture the optimal sparsification sizes for a range of
Boolean CSPs. For NP-complete Boolean CSPs whose constraints are symmetric (the
satisfaction depends only on the number of 1 values in the assignment, not on
their positions), we give a complete characterization of which constraint
languages allow for a linear sparsification. For Boolean CSPs in which every

measured directly but is inferred by interpreting spectroscopic observations in
the context of atomic physics calculations. Ratios of emission lines, for
example, can be used to infer the electron density of the emitting plasma.
Similarly, the relative intensities of emission lines formed over a wide range
of temperatures yield information on the temperature structure. A critical
component of this analysis is understanding how uncertainties in the underlying
atomic physics propagates to the uncertainties in the inferred plasma
parameters. At present, however, atomic physics databases do not include
uncertainties on the atomic parameters and there is no established methodology
for using them even if they did. In this paper we develop simple models for the
uncertainties in the collision strengths and decay rates for Fe XIII and apply
them to the interpretation of density sensitive lines observed with the EUV
Imagining spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode. We incorporate these uncertainties in a
Bayesian framework. We consider both a pragmatic Bayesian method where the
atomic physics information is unaffected by the observed data, and a fully
Bayesian method where the data can be used to probe the physics. The former
generally increases the uncertainty in the inferred density by about a factor
of 5 compared with models that incorporate only statistical uncertainties. The
latter reduces the uncertainties on the inferred densities, but identifies
areas of possible systematic problems with either the atomic physics or the
observed intensities.

radios with increased spectrum awareness in complex emerging wireless networks.
However, as the existing literature is overwhelmingly based on theoretical or
simulation results, it is unclear how well DMC performs in practice. In this
paper we study the performance of DMC in real-world wireless networks, using an
extensive RF signal dataset of 250,000 over-the-air transmissions with
heterogeneous transceiver hardware and co-channel interference. Our results
show that DMC can achieve a high classification accuracy even under the
challenging real-world conditions of modulated co-channel interference and
low-grade hardware. However, this only holds if the training dataset fully
captures the variety of interference and hardware types in the real radio
environment; otherwise, the DMC performance deteriorates significantly. Our
work has two important engineering implications. First, it shows that it is not
straightforward to exchange learned classifier models among dissimilar radio
environments and devices in practice. Second, our analysis suggests that the
key missing link for real-world deployment of DMC is designing signal features
that generalize well to diverse wireless network scenarios. We are making our

approximates the induced spatial distance function to leading order. This
admits a straightforward generalisation to the discrete analogue of a Cauchy

cornerstone of deep learning research, as they have enabled unprecedented
sequential data modeling capabilities. This effectiveness largely stems from
the capacity of these models to infer salient temporal dynamics over long
horizons; these are encoded into the obtained neural attention (NA)
distributions. However, existing NA formulations essentially constitute
point-wise selection mechanisms over the observed source sequences; that is,
attention weights computation relies on the assumption that each source
sequence element is independent of the rest. Unfortunately, although
convenient, this assumption fails to account for higher-order dependencies
which might be prevalent in real-world data. This paper addresses these
limitations by leveraging Quantum-Statistical modeling arguments. Specifically,
our work broadens the notion of NA, by attempting to account for the case that
the NA model becomes inherently incapable of discerning between individual
source elements; this is assumed to be the case due to higher-order temporal
dynamics. On the contrary, we postulate that in some cases selection may be
feasible only at the level of pairs of source sequence elements. To this end,
we cast NA into inference of an attention density matrix (ADM) approximation.
We derive effective training and inference algorithms, and evaluate our
approach in the context of a machine translation (MT) application. We perform
experiments with challenging benchmark datasets. As we show, our approach
yields favorable outcomes in terms of several evaluation metrics.

across cosmic time using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation
Horizon-AGN. The cosmic web structure is extracted via the persistent skeleton
as implemented in the DISPERSE algorithm. It is found that the spin of low-mass
galaxies is more likely to be aligned with the filaments of the cosmic web and
to lie within the plane of the walls while more massive galaxies tend to have a
spin perpendicular to the axis of the filaments and to the walls. The mass
transition is detected with a significance of 9 sigmas. This galactic alignment
is consistent with the alignment of the spin of dark haloes found in pure dark
matter simulations and with predictions from (anisotropic) tidal torque theory.
However, unlike haloes, the alignment of low-mass galaxies is weak and
disappears at low redshifts while the orthogonal spin orientation of massive
galaxies is strong and increases with time, probably as a result of mergers. At
fixed mass, alignments are correlated with galaxy morphology: the high-redshift
alignment is dominated by spiral galaxies while elliptical centrals are mainly
responsible for the perpendicular signal. These predictions for spin alignments
with respect to cosmic filaments and unprecendently walls are successfully
compared with existing observations. The alignment of the shape of galaxies
with the different components of the cosmic web is also investigated. A
coherent and stronger signal is found in terms of shape at high mass. The two
regimes probed in this work induce competing galactic alignment signals for
weak lensing, with opposite redshift and luminosity evolution. Understanding
the details of these intrinsic alignments will be key to exploit future major
cosmic shear surveys like Euclid or LSST.

control loop for dynamical systems. Due to real-time constraints, the major
challenge in MPC is to solve model-based optimal control problems in a very
short amount of time. For linear-quadratic problems, Bemporad et al.~have
proposed an explicit formulation where the underlying optimization problems are
solved a priori in an offline phase. In this article, we present an extension
of this concept in two significant ways. We consider nonlinear problems and --
more importantly -- problems with multiple conflicting objective functions. In
the offline phase, we build a library of Pareto optimal solutions from which we
then obtain a valid compromise solution in the online phase according to a
decision maker's preference. Since the standard multi-parametric programming
approach is no longer valid in this situation, we instead use interpolation
between different entries of the library. To reduce the number of problems that
have to be solved in the offline phase, we exploit symmetries in the dynamical
system and the corresponding multiobjective optimal control problem. The
results are verified using two different examples from autonomous driving.

characterized by a simplified coarse-grained model. Once the two models are
analytically connected with each other via energy conservation, Relative
Resolution can capture the structural and thermal behavior of (nonpolar)
multi-component and multi-phase systems across state space. The current work is
a natural continuation of our original communication [1]. Most importantly, we
present the comprehensive mathematics of Relative Resolution, basically casting
it as a multipole approximation at appropriate distances; the current set of
equations importantly applies for all systems (e.g, polar molecules). Besides,
we continue examining the capability of our multiscale approach in molecular
simulations, importantly showing that we can successfully retrieve not just the
statics but also the dynamics of liquid systems. We finally conclude by
discussing how Relative Resolution is the inherent variant of the famous

  Workshop (ITW), in Guangzhou, China",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In distributed computing systems, it is well recognized that worker nodes
that are slow (called stragglers) tend to dominate the overall job execution
time. Coded computation utilizes concepts from erasure coding to mitigate the
effect of stragglers by running ""coded"" copies of tasks comprising a job.
Stragglers are typically treated as erasures in this process. While this is
useful, there are issues with applying, e.g., MDS codes in a straightforward
manner. Specifically, several applications such as matrix-vector products deal
with sparse matrices. MDS codes typically require dense linear combinations of
submatrices of the original matrix which destroy their inherent sparsity. This
is problematic as it results in significantly higher processing times for
computing the submatrix-vector products in coded computation. Furthermore, it
also ignores partial computations at stragglers.
  In this work, we propose a fine-grained model that quantifies the level of
non-trivial coding needed to obtain the benefits of coding in matrix-vector
computation. Simultaneously, it allows us to leverage partial computations
performed by the straggler nodes. For this model, we propose and evaluate
several code designs and discuss their properties.

specifically via modeling variation in the spatial layout of a scene, such as
occlusions, and scene environmental factors, such as time of day and weather

suffer from stagnation problems where the solution does not change much from
iteration to iteration but the resultant solution shows artifacts such as
presence of a twin. We introduce a complexity parameter $\zeta$ that can be
computed directly from the Fourier magnitude data and provides a measure of

initiated with a uniformly random phase map, the complexity of the Fienup
solution containing stagnation artifacts stabilizes at a numerical value that

controlled sparsity enhancing step such that in every iteration the complexity
of the resulting solution is explicitly made close to $\zeta$. This approach
which we refer to as complexity guided phase retrieval (CGPR) is seen to
significantly reduce the number of phase retrieval iterations required for

Separately optimizing each individual strategy has two limitations. The first
one is lack of collaboration between scenarios meaning that each strategy
maximizes its own objective but ignores the goals of other strategies, leading
to a sub-optimal overall performance. The second limitation is the inability of
modeling the correlation between scenarios meaning that independent
optimization in one scenario only uses its own user data but ignores the

timelapse imagery starting from November 2014. However, searching and
documenting smoke emissions manually from all video frames requires manpower
and takes an impractical investment of time. This paper describes a software
tool which integrates four features: (1) an algorithm based on change detection
and texture segmentation for identifying smoke emissions; (2) an interactive
timeline visualization providing indicators for seeking to interesting events;
(3) an autonomous fast-forwarding mode for skipping uninteresting timelapse
frames; and (4) a collection of animated smoke images generated automatically
according to the algorithm for documentation, presentation, storytelling, and
sharing. With the help of this tool, citizen scientists can now focus on the
content of the story instead of time-consuming and laborious works.

RGB-D data we address in this paper. The first limitation is the lack of depth
data for training deep learning models. Rather than fine tuning or transferring
RGB-specific features, we address this limitation by proposing an architecture
and a two-step training approach that directly learns effective depth-specific
features using weak supervision via patches. The resulting RGB-D model also
benefits from more complementary multimodal features. Another limitation is the
short range of depth sensors (typically 0.5m to 5.5m), resulting in depth
images not capturing distant objects in the scenes that RGB images can. We show
that this limitation can be addressed by using RGB-D videos, where more
comprehensive depth information is accumulated as the camera travels across the
scene. Focusing on this scenario, we introduce the ISIA RGB-D video dataset to
evaluate RGB-D scene recognition with videos. Our video recognition
architecture combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that
are trained in three steps with increasingly complex data to learn effective

literature. The two most common examples are Nesterov's method, and Polyak's
momentum technique. In this paper two new algorithms are introduced for root
finding problems: 1) PolSA is a root finding algorithm with specially designed
matrix momentum, and 2) NeSA can be regarded as a variant of Nesterov's
algorithm, or a simplification of PolSA. The PolSA algorithm is new even in the
context of optimization (when cast as a root finding problem).
  The research surveyed in this paper is motivated by applications to
reinforcement learning. It is well known that most variants of TD- and
Q-learning may be cast as SA (stochastic approximation) algorithms, and the
tools from general SA theory can be used to investigate convergence and bounds
on convergence rate. In particular, the asymptotic variance is a common metric
of performance for SA algorithms, and is also one among many metrics used in
assessing the performance of stochastic optimization algorithms. There are two
well known SA techniques that are known to have optimal asymptotic variance:
the Ruppert-Polyak averaging technique, and stochastic Newton-Raphson (SNR).
The former algorithm can have extremely bad transient performance, and the
latter can be computationally expensive. It is demonstrated here that parameter
estimates from the new PolSA algorithm couple with those of the ideal (but more
complex) SNR algorithm. The new algorithm is thus a third approach to obtain
optimal asymptotic covariance.
  These strong results require assumptions on the model. A linearized model is
considered, and the noise is assumed to be a martingale difference sequence.
Numerical results are obtained in a non-linear setting that is the motivation
for this work: In PolSA implementations of Q-learning it is observed that
coupling occurs with SNR in this non-ideal setting.

growth of the speed with the field is followed by a sudden change in slope
accompanied by the emission of spin waves. In this work an analytical formula
for the speed of the domain wall that explains this behavior is derived by
means of an asymptotic study of the Landau Lifshitz Gilbert equation for thin
nanotubes. We show that the dynamics can be reduced to a one dimensional
hyperbolic reaction diffusion equation, namely, the damped double Sine Gordon

our MHD stellar corona model, to predict the ambient coronal radio emission and
its modulations induced by a close planet. For simplicity, the present work
assumes that the exoplanet is stationary in the frame rotating with the stellar
rotation. We explore the radio flux modulations using a limited parameter space
of idealized cases by changing the magnitude of the planetary field, its
polarity, the planetary orbital separation, and the strength of the stellar
field. We find that the modulations induced by the planet could be significant
and observable in the case of hot Jupiter planets --- above 100% modulation
with respect to the ambient flux in the $10-100~MHz$ range in some cases, and
2-10% in the frequency bands above $250~MHz$ for some cases. Thus, our work
indicates that radio signature of exoplanets might not be limited to
low-frequency radio range. We find that the intensity modulations are sensitive
to the planetary magnetic field polarity for short-orbit planets, and to the
stellar magnetic field strength for all cases. The new radio tool, when applied

compatible interfaces with properties such as the hysteresis and reversibility
of a phase transformation [35, 33, 12, 28], we give necessary and sufficient
conditions on the structural parameters of two helical phases such that they
are compatible. We show that, locally, four types of compatible interface are
possible: vertical, horizontal, helical and elliptical. We discuss the mobility
of these interfaces and give examples of systems of interfaces that are mobile
and could be used to fully transform a helical structure from one phase to
another.
  These results provide a basis for the tuning of helical structural parameters
so as to achieve compatibility of phases. In the case of transformations in
crystals, this kind of tuning has led to materials with exceptionally low
hysteresis and dramatically improved resistance to transformational fatigue.
Compatible helical transformations with low hysteresis and fatigue resistance
would exhibit an unusual shape memory effect involving both twist and
extension, and may have potential applications as new artificial muscles and
actuators.

we experimentally study the spatial dependence and spectral properties of
auto-oscillations in SHO devices based on Pt(7 nm)/\
Ni$_{\mathrm{80}}$Fe$_{\mathrm{20}}$(5 nm) tapered nanowires. Using Brillouin
light scattering microscopy, we observe two individual self-localized spin-wave
bullets that oscillate at two distinct frequencies (5.2 GHz and 5.45 GHz) and
are localized at different positions separated by about 750 nm within the SHO.
This state of a tapered SHO has been predicted by a Ginzburg-Landau
auto-oscillator model, but not yet been directly confirmed experimentally. We
demonstrate that the observed bullets can be individually synchronized to
external microwave signals, leading to a frequency entrainment, linewidth
reduction and increase in oscillation amplitude for the bullet that is selected
by the microwave frequency. At the same time, the amplitude of other parasitic
modes decreases, which promotes the single-mode operation of the SHO. Finally,
the synchronization of the spin-wave bullets is studied as a function of the
microwave power. We believe that our findings promote the realization of
extended spin Hall oscillators accomodating several distinct spin-wave bullets,
that jointly cover an extended range of tunability.

subgraph-based encoding of networks, (b) exact mutations based on solving
systems of Diophantine equations, and (c) heuristic diversity-driven mechanism
to drive resolution changes in the MapElite algorithm. We show that our
framework can elicit networks with diversity in their higher-order structure
and that this diversity affects the behaviour of the complex contagion model.
Through a comparison with state of the art clustered network generation
methods, we demonstrate that our approach can uncover a comparably diverse
range of networks without needing computationally unfeasible mixing times.
Further, we suggest that the subgraph-based encoding provides greater
confidence in the diversity of higher-order network structure for low numbers
of samples and is the basis for explaining our results with complex contagion
model. We believe that this framework could be applied to other complex
landscapes that cannot be practically mapped via exhaustive sampling.

(EMA) model of Doyen - proposed first to estimate bulk electrical conductivity,
{\sigma}_b, and permeability in sandstones from rock images - to scale up
{\sigma}_b and k in tight-gas sandstones from pore to core. For this purpose,
we calculate two characteristic pore sizes: an effective hydraulic and an
effective electrical pore size from pore-throat size distributions - determined
from mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) curves - and pore-throat
connectivity. The latter is estimated from critical volume fraction (or
percolation threshold) for macroscopic flow. Electrical conductivity and
permeability are then scaled up from the two characteristic pore sizes,
tortuosity, and porosity by assuming two different pore geometries: cylindrical
and slit-shaped. Comparison of results obtained for eighteen tight-gas
sandstones indicates that the EMA estimates {\sigma}_b and k more accurately
when pores are assumed to be cylindrical. We also estimate k from the
pore-throat size distributions and the measured electrical conductivity using
the EMA and critical path analysis (CPA), another upscaling technique borrowed
from statistical physics. Theoretically, the former is valid in relatively
heterogeneous porous media with narrow pore-throat size distribution, while the
latter is valid in heterogeneous media with broad pore-throat size
distribution. Results show that the EMA estimates k more accurately than CPA
and arrives within a factor of two of the measurements on average.

  text overlap with arXiv:1804.00776",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The eigenvectors of the electronic stress tensor have been identified as
useful for the prediction of chemical reactivity because they determine the
most preferred directions to move the bonds that correspond to a qualitative
change in the molecular electronic structure. A new 3-D vector based
interpretation of the chemical bond that we refer to as the bond-path framework
set $\mathbb{B} = \{p,q,r\}$ provides a version of the quantum theory of atoms
in molecules (QTAIM) beyond the minimum definition for bonding that is
particularly suitable for understanding changes in molecular electronic
structure that occur during reactions. The bond-path framework set $\mathbb{B}$
is straightforwardly constructed and visualized from the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of QTAIM. This approach is applied to the structural deformations
of ethene that occur during applied torsion ${\theta}$, -180.0{\deg} $\leq$
${\theta}$ $\leq$ +180.0{\deg}. The corresponding stress tensor version is
readily constructed as $\mathbb{B}_{\sigma} = \{p_{\sigma},q_{\sigma},r\}$
within the QTAIM partitioning making it possible to compare experimentally and
computationally determined electronic charge densities. The bond-path framework
set $\mathbb{B}$ or $\mathbb{B}_{\sigma}$ are the networks that comprise three
strands: the least preferred ($p, p_{\sigma}$), most preferred ($q,
q_{\sigma}$) and $r$ is the familiar QTAIM bond-path. We demonstrate that the
most preferred direction for bond motion using the stress tensor corresponds to
the most compressible direction and not to the least compressible direction as
previously reported. We show the necessity for a directional approach
constructed using the eigenvectors along the entire bond length and demonstrate
the insufficiency of the sole use of scalar measures for capturing the nature
of the stress tensor within the QTAIM partitioning.

critical to efficient processing. Yet, during development, when building a
knowledge base of the world is occurring, the ability to selectively allocate
attentional resources is limited (e.g., Amso & Scerif, 2015). In adulthood,
research has demonstrated that surrounding the spatial location of attentional
focus is a suppressive field, resulting from top-down attention promoting the
processing of relevant stimuli and inhibiting surrounding distractors (e.g.,
Hopf et al., 2006). It is not fully known, however, whether this phenomenon
manifests in development. In the current study, we examined whether spatial
suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention is exhibited in
developmental age groups. Participants between 12 and 27 years of age exhibited
spatial suppression surrounding their focus of visual attention. Their accuracy
increased as a function of the separation distance between a spatially cued
(and attended) target and a second target, suggesting that a ring of
suppression surrounded the attended target. When a central cue was instead
presented and therefore attention was no longer spatially cued, surround
suppression was not observed, indicating that our initial findings of
suppression were indeed related to the focus of attention. Attentional surround
suppression was not observed in 8- to 11-years-olds, even with a longer spatial
cue presentation time, demonstrating that the lack of the effect at these ages
is not due to slowed attentional feedback processes. Our findings demonstrate
that top-down attentional processes are still immature until approximately 12
years of age, and that they continue to be refined throughout adolescence,
converging well with previous research on attentional development.

framework of the Ostrovsky equation with variable coefficients in relation to
surface and internal waves in a rotating ocean with a variable bottom
topography. For solitary waves moving toward the beach, the terminal decay
caused by the rotation effect can be suppressed by the shoaling effect. Two
basic examples of a bottom profile are analyzed in detail and supported by
direct numerical modelling. One of them is a constant-slope bottom and the
other is a specific bottom profile providing a constant amplitude solitary
wave. Estimates with real oceanic parameters show that the predicted effects of
stable soliton dynamics in a coastal zone can occur, in particular, for
internal waves.

is divided into 16 climate zones, for example, and each zone imposes different
energy-related building standards -- so for example different zones have
different roofing standards. Although developed long ago, these zones continue
to shape urban policy. New climate zone definitions are now emerging in urban
settings. Both the County of Los Angeles and the US Department of Energy have
recently adopted refined zones -- for restructuring electricity rates, and for
scoring home energy efficiency. Defining new zones is difficult, however,
because climates depend on variables that are difficult to map.
  In this paper we show that Los Angeles climate zones can be inferred from
energy use data. We have studied residential electricity consumption (EC)
patterns in Los Angeles data. This data permits identification of geographical
zones whose EC patterns are characteristically different from surrounding
regions. These regions have topographic boundaries in Los Angeles consistent
with microclimates.
  Specifically, our key finding is that EC-microclimate zones -- regions in
which block groups have similar Electricity Consumption patterns over time --
resemble environmental microclimate zones. Because they conform to
microclimates, but are based directly on EC data, these zones can be useful in
urban energy management.
  We also show how microclimates and household electricity consumption in Los
Angeles are strongly linked to socioeconomic variables like income and
population density. These links permit data-driven development of microclimate
zones that support zone-specific modeling and improved energy policy.

  buildings","Preprint submitted to Energy and Buildings",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the question of identifying the time-window in
short-term past from which the information regarding the future occupant's
window opening actions and resulting window states in buildings can be
predicted. The addressed sequence duration was in the range between 30 and 240
time-steps of indoor climate data, where the applied temporal discretization
was one minute. For that purpose, a deep neural network is trained to predict
the window states, where the input sequence duration is handled as an
additional hyperparameter. Eventually, the relationship between the prediction
accuracy and the time-lag of the predicted window state in future is analyzed.
The results pointed out, that the optimal predictive performance was achieved
for the case where 60 time-steps of the indoor climate data were used as input.
Additionally, the results showed that very long sequences (120-240 time-steps)
could be addressed efficiently, given the right hyperprameters. Hence, the use
of the memory over previous hours of high-resolution indoor climate data did
not improve the predictive performance, when compared to the case where 30/60
minutes indoor sequences were used. The analysis of the prediction accuracy in
the form of F1 score for the different time-lag of future window states dropped
from 0.51 to 0.27, when shifting the prediction target from 10 to 60 minutes in
future.

Many methods have been devised to overcome limitations due to either noise in
the spectra or asymmetric profiles, the most common of which are the intensity
weighted averages (first moment) or fits of analytical (typically Gaussian)
profiles. If the spectral line can be considered a single component, we
demonstrate that a simple quadratic fit to the pixel of maximum intensity and
its two neighboring pixels provides a robust measure of the line centroid. This
approach allows for a sub-velocity resolution precision on the line centroid,
without be biases by noise or asymmetric features in the line profile and
outperforming traditional methods in most situations.

  learning perspective","22pages, comments are welcome",,,,"cs.GR cs.LG math.NA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we are concerned with the 2D and 3D geometric shape generation
by prescribing a set of characteristic values of a specific geometric body. One
of the major motivations of our study is the 3D human body generation in
various applications. We develop a novel method that can generate the desired
body with customized characteristic values. The proposed method follows a
machine-learning flavour that generates the inferred geometric body with the
input characteristic parameters from a training dataset. One of the critical
ingredients and novelties of our method is the borrowing of inverse scattering
techniques in the theory of wave propagation to the body generation. This is
done by establishing a delicate one-to-one correspondence between a geometric
body and the far-field pattern of a source scattering problem governed by the
Helmholtz system. It in turn enables us to establish a one-to-one
correspondence between the geometric body space and the function space defined
by the far-field patterns. Hence, the far-field patterns can act as the shape
generators. The shape generation with prescribed characteristic parameters is
achieved by first manipulating the shape generators and then reconstructing the
corresponding geometric body from the obtained shape generator by a stable
multiple-frequency Fourier method. Our method is easy to implement and produces
more efficient and stable body generations. We provide both theoretical
analysis and extensive numerical experiments for the proposed method. The study
is the first attempt to introduce inverse scattering approaches in combination
with machine learning to the geometric body generation and it opens up many
opportunities for further developments.

network (CRAHN) has been presented. Disaster management has been a big problem
for mankind for years. However, still not much research work has been presented
on this problem. Technology has been employed in past few years to address this
problem. Cognitive radio ad hoc network presents a viable solution for disaster
management. It can be deployed rapidly without infrastructure and it solves the
spectrum scarcity and congestion issues that arise during disaster. This paper
presents a novel solution for disaster management. It provides a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) based disaster detection scheme based on WSN. To solve the
spectrum scarcity problem, a MLP based spectrum management scheme has been
proposed. In order to ensure collaboration among rescue workers during
disaster, a novel service discovery scheme has been proposed. To ensure
interoperability during communication, XML format has been recommended. A
real-time GUI has been proposed to provide shared situation awareness to rescue
workers and enabling better decision making. The proposed approach has been
implemented in NS-2 simulator. The results show accurate disaster detection,
efficient spectrum usage, and interoperability and collaboration among nodes
with reduced latency.

offloading the computational task to a \textit{nearby} server to achieve
ultra-low latency. Augmented reality applications for instance have strict
latency requirements which can be fulfilled by an interplay between cloud and
edge servers. In this work, we study the impact of load on a hybrid edge cloud
system. The resource distribution between central cloud and edge affects the
capacity of the network. Optimizing delay and capacity constraints of this
hybrid network is similar to maximum cardinal bin packing problem which is
NP-hard. We design a simulation framework using a city-scale access point
dataset to propose an enhanced capacity edge cloud network while answering
following questions: (a) how much load an edge cloud network can support
without affecting the performance of an application, (b) how is application
delay-constraint limit affects the capacity of the network, (c) what is the
impact of load and resource distribution on goodput, (d) under what
circumstances, cloud can perform better than edge network and (e) what is the
impact of inter-edge networking bandwidth on the system capacity. An evaluation
system and model is developed to analyze the tradeoffs of different edge cloud
deployments and results are shown to support the claims.
