its two outbursts in 1995-1997. We have found a significant transition, i.e., a
sharp change, of both spectral and timing properties around a flux of $\rm
10^{-8}\ ergs\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$ (3-30 keV), which corresponds to a luminosity
of 2--8$\rm \times 10^{37}\ ergs\ s^{-1}$ for a distance of 4--8 kpc. We define
the faint (bright) state when the flux is smaller (larger) than this threshold.
In the faint state, the spectral hardness increases significantly with the
increasing flux, while remaining almost constant in the bright state. In
addition, we find that the pulsed fraction is positively related to both the
flux and the energy (<30keV) in both states. Thanks to the very stable pulse
profile shape in all energy bands, a hard X-ray lag could be measured. This lag
is only significant in the faint state (reaching $\sim$ 20\,ms between 3-4 keV
and 16-20 keV), and much smaller in the bright state ($\lesssim$2ms). We
speculate that the discovered transition might be caused by changes of the
accretion structure on the surface of the neutron star, and the hard X-ray lags
are due to a geometry effect.

Sun, will yield information about the conditions at the Sun's birthplace. We
search for solar sibling candidates in AMBRE, the very large spectra database
of solar vicinity stars. Since the ages and chemical abundances of solar
siblings are very similar to those of the Sun, we carried out a chemistry- and
age-based search for solar sibling candidates. We used high-resolution spectra
to derive precise stellar parameters and chemical abundances of the stars. We
used these spectroscopic parameters together with Gaia DR2 astrometric data to
derive stellar isochronal ages. Gaia data were also used to study the
kinematics of the sibling candidates. From the about 17000 stars that are
characterized within the AMBRE project, we first selected 55 stars whose
metallicities are closest to the solar value (-0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1 dex). For
these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, alpha-
and neutron-capture elements, based on which we selected 12 solar sibling
candidates with average abundances and metallicities between -0.03 to 0.03 dex.
Our further selection left us with 4 candidates with stellar ages that are
compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the 2 of
the hottest candidates, we derived the carbon isotopic ratios, which are
compatible with the solar value. HD186302 is the most precisely characterized
and probably the most probable candidate of our 4 best candidates. Very precise
chemical characterization and age estimation is necessary to identify solar
siblings. We propose that in addition to typical chemical tagging, the study of
isotopic ratios can give further important information about the relation of
sibling candidates with the Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic age determinations of
the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise isochronal ages.

burst of interest, also due to experimental implementations. The dynamics of

information related quantities, such as concurrence and entanglement entropy,
have been investigated under different protocols bringing the system out of
equilibrium. In this paper we focus on the entanglement entropy dynamics under
a sinusoidal drive of the transverse magnetic field in the 1D quantum Ising
model. We find that the area and the volume law of the entanglement entropy
coexist under periodic drive for an initial non-critical ground state.
Furthermore, starting from a critical ground state, the entanglement entropy
exhibits finite size scaling even under such a periodic drive. This
critical-like behaviour of the out-of-equilibrium driven state can persist for
arbitrarily long time, provided that the entanglement entropy is evaluated on
increasingly subsystem sizes, whereas for smaller sizes a volume law holds.
Finally, we give an interpretation of the simultaneous occurrence of critical
and non-critical behaviour in terms of the propagation of Floquet
quasi-particles.

it was in high/soft state during the 2016 NuSTAR observations. This is the
first time that a comparison of the soft and hard spectral states during an
outburst is being reported in MXB 1658-298. Compared with the observation of
2015, the X-ray luminosity was about four times higher during 2016. The hard
state spectrum can be well described with models consisting of a
single-temperature blackbody component along with Comptonized disc emission, or
three component model comprising of multi-colour disc, single-temperature
blackbody and thermal Comptonization components. The soft state spectrum can be
described with blackbody or disc blackbody and Comptonization component, where
the neutron star surface (or boundary layer) is the dominant source for the
Comptonization seed photons. We have also found a link between the spectral
state of the source and the Fe K absorber. The absorption features due to
highly ionized Fe were observed only in the soft state. This suggests a
probable connection between accretion disc wind (or atmosphere) and spectral

luminosity relationship (FGLR). This is a relationship between the absolute
bolometric magnitude $M_{\rm bol}$ and the spectroscopically determined
flux-weighted gravity $g_{\rm F} = g/T^4_{\rm eff}$. We computed a grid of
binary stellar evolution models with MESA and use the v2.1 BPASS models to
examine whether they are compatible with the relatively small scatter shown by
the observed relationship. Our models have initial primary masses of 9 - 30
$M_\odot$, initial orbital periods of 10 - 2511 days, mass ratio $q$ = 0.9, and
metallicity $Z$ = 0.02. We find that the majority of primary stars that produce
blue supergiant stages are consistent with the observed FGLR, with a small
offset towards brighter bolometric magnitudes. In between 1\% - 24\% of cases,
binary evolution may produce blue supergiants after a mass transfer episode,
that lie below the observed FGLR. A small number of such stars have been found
in extragalactic FGLR studies, suggesting that they may have evolved through
binary interaction. Some models with shorter periods could resemble blue
hypergiants and LBVs. We used CMFGEN radiative transfer models to investigate
the effects of unresolved secondaries on diagnostics for $T_{\rm eff}$ and $g$,
and the biases on the determination of interstellar reddening and $M_{\rm
bol}$. We find that the effects are small and within the observed scatter, but
could lead to a small overestimate of the luminosity, of $T_{\rm eff}$ and of
$g$ for extreme cases. We conclude that the observed FGLR can, in principle, be
well reproduced by close binary evolution models.

ranging from social networks over collaboration graphs to document analysis.
Recent work has extended this task to multiple graphs; i.e. the goal is to find
groups of vertices highly dense among multiple graphs. In this paper, we argue
that in a multi-graph scenario the sparsity is valuable for knowledge
extraction as well. We introduce the concept of contrasting quasi-clique
patterns: a collection of vertices highly dense in one graph but highly sparse
(i.e. less connected) in a second graph. Thus, these patterns specifically
highlight the difference/contrast between the considered graphs. Based on our
novel model, we propose an algorithm that enables fast computation of
contrasting patterns by exploiting intelligent traversal and pruning
techniques. We showcase the potential of contrasting patterns on a variety of
synthetic and real-world datasets.

post-transition metal chalcogenides (PTMC), InSe and GaSe. It has recently been
found that the band gap in 2D crystals of InSe more than doubles in the
monolayer compared to thick multilayer crystals, while the high mobility of
conduction band electrons is promoted by their light in-plane mass. Here, we
use Raman and PL measurements of encapsulated few layer samples, coupled with
accurate atomic force and transmission electron microscope structural
characterisation to reveal new optical properties of atomically thin GaSe
preserved by hBN encapsulation. The band gaps we observe complement the
spectral range provided by InSe films, so that optical activity of these two
almost lattice-matched PTMC films and their heterostructures densely cover the
spectrum of photons from violet to infrared. We demonstrate the realisation of
the latter by the first observation of interlayer excitonic photoluminescence
in few-layer InSe-GaSe heterostructures. The spatially indirect transition is
direct in k-space and therefore is bright, while its energy can be tuned in a
broad range by the number of layers.

products of a strong but poorly-understood interaction during the AGB phase.
The aim of this contribution is to update the orbital elements of a sample of
galactic post-AGB binaries observed in a long-term radial-velocity monitoring
campaign. Radial velocities are computed from high signal-to-noise spectra by
use of a cross-correlation method. The radial-velocity curves are fitted by
using both a least-squares algorithm and a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. We
use a Monte Carlo method to compute uncertainties on the orbital elements. The
resulting mass functions are used to derive a companion mass distribution by
optimising the predicted to the observed cumulative mass-function
distributions, after correcting for observational bias. As a result, we derive
and update orbital elements for 33 galactic post-AGB binaries, among which 3
are new orbits. The orbital periods of the systems range from 100 to about 3000
days. Over 70 percent (23 out of 33) of our binaries have significant non-zero
eccentricities ranging over all periods. Their orbits are non-circular despite
the fact that the Roche-lobe radii are smaller than the maximum size of a
typical AGB star and tidal circularisation should have been strong when the
objects were on the AGB. We derive a distribution of companion masses that is
peaked around 1.09 $M_\odot$ with a standard deviation of 0.62 $M_\odot$. The
large spread in companion masses highlights the diversity of post-AGB binary
systems. Furthermore, we find that only post-AGB stars with high effective
temperatures (> 5500 K) in wide orbits are depleted in refractory elements,
suggesting that re-accretion of material from a circumbinary disc is an ongoing
process. It appears, however, that chemical depletion is inefficient for the
closest orbits irrespective of the actual surface temperature.

canceled after aggregating all meters' masked readings, and thus the utility

utility can verify the aggregated reading integrity without accessing the
individual readings to preserve privacy. It can also identify the attackers and
compute electricity bills efficiently by using the fine-grained readings
without violating privacy. Furthermore, EPIC can resist collusion attacks in
which the utility colludes with a relay node to extract the meters' readings. A
formal proof, probabilistic analysis are used to evaluate the security of EPIC,

determine the corotation radius of the bar, using the photometric phase
crossing method. This method uses the phase angle of the spiral structure in
several wavebands, and looks for a crossing between the blue (B) light and the
redder wavebands (e.g., R or I). For NGC 613, we find two phase crossings, an
outer phase crossing at 136 +/- 8 arcsec and an inner phase crossing at 16 +/-
8 arcsec. We argue that the outer phase crossing is due to the bar corotation
radius, and from the bar length of $R_{\rm bar}=90.0\pm4.0$ arcsec we go on to
calculate a relative bar pattern speed of R = 1.5 +/- 0.1, which is consistent
with the results of previous methods described in the literature. For a better
understanding of the inner phase crossing, we have created structure maps in
all four wavebands and a B-R color map. All of our structure maps and our color
map highlight a nuclear ring of star formation at a radius of ~4 arcsec, which
had also been observed recently using ALMA. Furthermore, the radius of our
inner phase crossing appears to be consistent with the size of a nuclear disk
of star formation that has been recently detected and described in the
literature. We therefore suggest that the phase crossing method can be used to
detect the size of nuclear star formation regions as well as the location of
corotation resonances in spiral galaxies.

early initiation of therapeutic interventions and management strategies.
However, methods for early detection still remain an unmet clinical need in PD.
In this study, we use the Patient Questionnaire (PQ) portion from the widely
used Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(MDS-UPDRS) to develop prediction models that can classify early PD from
healthy normal using machine learning techniques that are becoming popular in
biomedicine: logistic regression, random forests, boosted trees and support
vector machine (SVM). We carried out both subject-wise and record-wise
validation for evaluating the machine learning techniques. We observe that
these techniques perform with high accuracy and high area under the ROC curve
(both >95%) in classifying early PD and healthy normal. The logistic model
demonstrated statistically significant fit to the data indicating its
usefulness as a predictive model. It is inferred that these prediction models
have the potential to aid clinicians in the diagnostic process by joining the
items of a questionnaire through machine learning.

outflows and model radiative feedback using the ray-tracing radiative transfer
or thermal energy injection. In our simulations the central SMBH transitions
between the radiatively efficient and radiatively inefficient states on
timescales of a few Gyr, as a function of its accretion rate. The timescale for
this transition depends primarily on the fraction of power allocated to each
feedback mode, and to a lesser degree on the overall feedback luminosity of the
active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we find that (a) kinetic feedback
must be present at both low and high accretion rates in order to prevent the
cooling catastrophe, and (b) its contribution likely accounts for > 10% of the
total AGN feedback power, since below this threshold simulated BCGs tend to
host radio-loud quasars most of the time, in apparent contrast with
observations. We also find a positive correlation between the AGN feedback
power and the mass of the cold gas filaments in the cluster core, indicating
that observations of H$\alpha$ filaments can be used as a measure of AGN

system has an energy gap above ground state, or if there is a continuous range
of low-energy excitations - pervades quantum many-body physics. Recently, this
important problem was shown to be undecidable for quantum spin systems in two
(or more) spatial dimensions: there exists no algorithm that determines in
general whether a system is gapped or gapless, a result which has many
unexpected consequences for the physics of such systems. However, there are
many indications that one dimensional spin systems are simpler than their
higher-dimensional counterparts: for example, they cannot have thermal phase
transitions or topological order, and there exist highly-effective numerical
algorithms such as DMRG - and even provably polynomial-time ones - for gapped
1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area-law.
Furthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on
aperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D.
  So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D? In this paper we
prove this is not the case, by constructing a family of 1D spin chains with
translationally-invariant nearest neighbour interactions for which no algorithm
can determine the presence of a spectral gap. This not only proves that the
spectral gap of 1D systems is just as intractable as in higher dimensions, but
also predicts the existence of qualitatively new types of complex physics in 1D
spin chains. In particular, it implies there are 1D systems with constant
spectral gap and non-degenerate classical ground state for all systems sizes up
to an uncomputably large size, whereupon they switch to a gapless behaviour
with dense spectrum.

cluster initial mass function (CIMF) deviates from a pure power-law and instead
truncates exponentially. We investigate the effects of this truncation on the
formation of globular cluster (GC) systems by updating our analytic model for
cluster formation and evolution, which is based on dark matter halo merger
trees coupled to empirical galactic scaling relations, and has been shown in
previous work to match a wide array of observational data. The cutoff masses of
$M_c=10^{6.5} M_{\odot}$ or $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ match many scaling relations:
between the GC system mass and host halo mass, between the average metallicity
of the GC system and host halo mass, and the distribution of cluster masses.
This range of $M_c$ agrees with indirect measurements from extragalactic GC
systems. Models with $M_c<10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$ cannot reproduce the observed GC
metallicity and mass distributions in massive galaxies. The slope of the
mass-metallicity relation for metal-poor clusters (blue tilt) for all $M_c$
models is consistent with observations within their errors, when measured using
the same method. We introduce an alternative, more robust fitting method, which
reveals a trend of increasing tilt slope for lower $M_c$. In our model the blue
tilt arises because the metal-poor clusters form in relatively low-mass
galaxies which lack sufficient cold gas to sample the CIMF at highest masses.
Massive blue clusters form in progressively more massive galaxies and inherit
their higher metallicity. The metal-rich clusters do not exhibit such a tilt
because they form in significantly more massive galaxies, which have enough
cold gas to fully sample the CIMF.

of axion DM models topped with a dynamical misalignment mechanism. After the
reheating, when the temperature is well above the electroweak scale, the
backreaction potential disappears and the relaxion is displaced from its
vacuum. When the ""wiggles"" reappear the relaxion coherently oscillates around
its minimum as in the case of vanilla axion DM models. We identify the
parameter space such that the relaxion is retrapped leading to the standard
cosmology. When the relaxion is lighter than $10^{-7}\,$eV, Hubble friction
during radiation-domination is sufficiently strong for retrapping, and even
minimal models are found to be viable. It also leads to a new constraint on
relaxion models, as a certain region of their parameter space could lead to
overabundant relaxion DM. Alternatively, even a larger parameter space exists
when additional friction is obtained by particle production from additional
coupling to an additional dark photon field. The phenomenology of this class of
models is quite unique, as it implies that we are surrounded by a
time-dependent axion-like field that due to relaxion-Higgs mixing implies
time-dependent Higgs vacuum-expectation-value that lead to time-variation of

Taking the symmetron as a specific example of such a theory, we solve the

point source and (ii) two identical point sources with arbitrary separation. We
find that the mass of a single point source can be screened by the symmetron
field, provided that its mass is above a critical value. We find that two point
sources behave as independent, isolated sources when the separation between
them is large, but, when their separation is smaller than the symmetron's
Compton wavelength, they behave much like a single point source with the same
total mass. Finally, we explore closely related behavior in a toy Higgs-Yukawa
model, and find indications that the maximum fermion mass that can be generated
consistently via a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs in 1+1 dimensions is roughly
the mass of the Higgs itself, with potentially intriguing implications for the

its Roche lobe with matter accreting onto a compact object (either a black hole
or neutron star). Two jets of ionized matter with a bulk velocity of
$\sim0.26c$ extend from the binary, perpendicular to the line of sight, and
terminate inside W50, a supernova remnant that is being distorted by the jets.
SS 433 differs from other microquasars in that the accretion is believed to be
super-Eddington, and the luminosity of the system is $\sim10^{40}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. The lobes of W50 in which the jets terminate, about 40 pc from the
central source, are expected to accelerate charged particles, and indeed radio
and X-ray emission consistent with electron synchrotron emission in a magnetic
field have been observed. At higher energies (>100 GeV), the particle fluxes of
$\gamma$ rays from X-ray hotspots around SS 433 have been reported as flux
upper limits. In this energy regime, it has been unclear whether the emission
is dominated by electrons that are interacting with photons from the cosmic
microwave background through inverse-Compton scattering or by protons
interacting with the ambient gas. Here we report TeV $\gamma$-ray observations
of the SS 433/W50 system where the lobes are spatially resolved. The TeV
emission is localized to structures in the lobes, far from the center of the
system where the jets are formed. We have measured photon energies of at least
25 TeV, and these are certainly not Doppler boosted, because of the viewing
geometry. We conclude that the emission from radio to TeV energies is
consistent with a single population of electrons with energies extending to at
least hundreds of TeV in a magnetic field of $\sim16$~micro-Gauss.

symmetry arises accidentally with the imposition of a discrete $Z_9$ symmetry,
which also secludes the different scales in the double seesaw mechanism taking
place in the neutrino sector. The symmetry breakdown is performed by three
scalar triplets plus a scalar singlet hosting an axion field, whose particle
excitation can be a component of dark matter. We show a mechanism where a small
effective vev is generated for a scalar triplet which is supposed to have a
bare mass above the energy scale where the $SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X$ symmetry is
broken. Combined with the energy scale in which the $U(1)_{PQ}$ is broken, such
a mechanism gives rise to a natural hierarchy to the fermions. Beyond the
Standard Model particle content, the model predicts an invisible axion, $a$,
three GeV neutrinos, $N_{iL}$, plus several new particles at the TeV scale
which are: five vector bosons, $U^\pm$, $V^0$, $V^{0\dagger}$, and $Z^\prime$;
one up-type $U$, and two down-type $D_a$ quarks; and at least a CP-even, $H_1$,
plus non-hermitian neutral, $\phi^0$, $\phi^{0\dagger}$, scalar bosons. The
model may be tested by looking for the possible production of such particles at

unresolved in the FIRST images and spectroscopically classified as low

extended emission. Six have steep radio spectra, 11 are flat cores, while one
shows an inverted spectrum. We find that 1) the ratio between core and total
emission in FR0s is $\sim$30 times higher than in FRI and 2) FR0s share the
same properties with FRIs from the nuclear and host point of view. FR0s differ
from FRIs only for the paucity of extended radio emission. Different scenarios
were investigated: 1) the possibility that all FR0s are young sources
eventually evolving into extended sources is ruled out by the distribution of
radio sizes; 2) similarly, a time-dependent scenario, where a variation of
accretion or jet launching prevents the formation of large-scales radio
structures, appears to be rather implausible due to the large abundance of
sub-kpc objects 3) a scenario in which FR0s are produced by mildly relativistic
jets is consistent with the data but requires observations of a larger sample
to be properly tested.

state of affairs has persisted because of the desire to have p-type hole

polarization fields in nitride heterostructures, there exist four permutations
of doping and polarization for the realization of such light emitters. Which
permutation is the most desirable for efficient light emission? In this work,
we answer this question by demonstrating a fundamentally new approach towards
efficient light emission with bottom-tunnel junctions. The bottom-tunnel
junction design aligns the polarization fields in a desired direction in the
quantum well, while simultaneously eliminating the need for p-type contacts,
and allowing efficient current spreading. By preventing electron overshoot past
quantum wells, it disables carrier recombination in undesired regions of the
quantized heterostructures, and opens up the possibility for new geometries of
integrating and stacking multiple light emitters. Due to the inherent
advantages, the bottom-tunnel junction light emitting diode enables a 200-300%
increase in the light emission efficiency over alternate heterostructure
designs.

The quality of perovskite films is vital for the performance of devices. We

MAI.PbI$_2$.DMSO into CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$. We researched in detail on the

roughness and grain size of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ films together increased with
increasing drying temperature. The larger grain size could efficiently reduce
crystal boundaries which is advantageous for the suppression of photo-induced
charge carrier recombination resulting in increase of FF. However, increase of
surface roughness resulted in larger contact area at interface which might
produce more tarp states and poorer wettability of HTM solution leading in
decrease of Jsc. Surface morphology of MAPbI3 layer on the performance of solar

Landau levels, and are predictive of quantum oscillations in transport and
thermodynamic quantities. Such rules -- as formulated by Onsager, Lifshitz and
Roth -- apply when the spin-orbit interaction dominates over the Zeeman
interaction (or vice versa), but does not generally apply when the two
interactions are comparable in strength. In this work, we present a generalized
quantization rule which treats the spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions on equal
footing, and therefore has wider applicability to spin-orbit-coupled materials
lacking a spatial inversion center, or having magnetic order. More generally,
our rule describes the Landau quantization of any number of nearly degenerate
energy bands -- in any symmetry class. The resultant Landau-level spectrum is
generically non-equidistant but may contain spin (or pseudospin) degeneracies.
To tune to such degeneracies in the absence of crystalline point-group
symmetries, three real parameters are needed. We have exhaustively identified
all symmetry classes of cyclotron orbits for which this number is reduced from
three, thus establishing symmetry-enforced 'non-crossing rules' for Landau
levels. In particular, only one parameter is needed in the presence of spatial
rotation or inversion; this single parameter may be the magnitude or
orientation of the field. Signatures of single-parameter tunability include (i)
a smooth crossover between period-doubled and -undoubled quantum oscillations
in the low-temperature Shubnikov-de Haas effect, as well as (ii) 'magic-angle'
magnetoresistance oscillations. We demonstrate the utility of our quantization
rule, as well as the tunability of Landau-level degeneracies, for the
Rashba-Dresselhaus two-dimensional electron gas -- subject to an arbitrarily
oriented magnetic field.

spiral arrays embedded in three-dimensional space by evaluating the Thouless
conductance, the level spacing statistics, and by performing a finite-size
scaling. This light localization transition is different from the Anderson
transition because Vogel spirals are deterministic structures. Moreover, this
transition occurs when the vector character of light is fully taken into
account, in contrast to what is expected for traditional uniform random media
of point-like scatterers. We show that light localization in Vogel arrays is a
collective phenomenon that involves the contribution of multiple length scales.
Vogel spirals are suitable photonic platforms to localize light thanks to their
distinctive structural correlation properties that enable collective
electromagnetic excitations with strong light-matter coupling. Our results
unveil the importance of aperiodic correlations for the engineering of photonic
media with strongly enhanced light-matter coupling compared to the traditional

neutron star (NS, spin period ~1300 s), accreting matter from the stellar wind
of an O8I star, with an orbital period of ~9 d. We analyzed all archival
XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT observations, performing a detailed temporal and
spectral analysis of its X-ray emission. XMM-Newton light curves show
high-variability and flaring activity on several timescales. In one observation
we detected two short and bright flares where the flux increased by a factor of
~10 for ~300 s, with similar behavior in the soft and hard X-ray bands. By
inspecting the 4500-day light curves of the Swift/BAT data, we derived a
refined period of 8.99$\pm$0.01 days. The XMM-Newton spectra are characterized
by a highly absorbed continuum and a Fe absorption edge at ~7 keV. We fitted
the continuum with a thermally Comptonized model, and the emission lines with 3
narrow Gaussian functions using two absorption components, to take into account
both the interstellar medium and the intrinsic absorption. We derived the
column density at different orbital phases, showing its clear modulation. We
also show that the flux of the Fe K$\alpha$ line is correlated with the NH
column, suggesting a link between absorbing and fluorescent matter that,
together with the orbital modulation, points towards the SG wind as the main
contributor to both continuum absorption and Fe K$\alpha$ emission. Assuming a
simple model for the SG wind we were able to explain the orbital modulation of
the absorption column density, Fe K$\alpha$ emission, and the high-energy
Swift/BAT flux, allowing us to constrain the geometrical parameters of the

implemented in a standalone piece of software (DiSPy). The method is then

causes the density to vanish which generally occurs in the nonlinear regime.
(2) The Schrodinger-Poisson solver works well in all test cases, but it is

the correct dynamics on large scales. (3) We compare the mass power spectrum

find good agreement in the mildly nonlinear regime. Compared with fluid
perturbation theory, wave perturbation theory has a more limited range of

number of possible challenges, but can often generate unsolvable or
uninteresting challenges. To better understand the compromises involved in
minimizing undesirable challenges, we examine three games where component
design choices can influence the stochastic nature of the resulting challenge
generation algorithms. We evaluate the effect of these components and
algorithms on challenge solvability and challenge engagement. We find that
algorithms which control randomness through entangling components based on
sub-elements of the puzzle mechanics can generate interesting challenges with a
high probability of being solvable.

We consider two processes involving the $\rho$. The first process is elastic
scattering of two pions in P-wave with isospin $1$. Using the L\""uscher method
we determine the scattering phase shift, from which we obtain the $\rho$
resonance mass and decay width $\Gamma(\rho\to\pi\pi)$. The second process is
the radiative transition $\pi\gamma\to\pi\pi$, where we follow the
Brice\~no-Hansen-Walker-Loud approach to determine the transition amplitude in
the invariant mass region near the $\rho$ resonance and for both space- and
time-like photon momentum. This allows us to determine the coupling between the
$\rho$, the pion and the photon, and the resulting $\rho$ radiative decay

because they obtain dense depth measurements with minimal latency. However, for

hungry and can limit the battery life of the device. To address this issue, we
present an algorithm that lowers the power for depth sensing by reducing the

when an accurate depth map cannot be estimated. To ensure that the overall
system power for depth sensing is reduced, we design our algorithm to run on a
low power embedded platform, where it outputs 640x480 depth maps at 30 frames

a more challenging inverse problem, mainly due to its reliance on a sub-pixel
accurate motion-estimation, which has no parallel in SISR. Another complication
is the dynamics of the video, often addressed by simply generating a single
frame instead of a complete output sequence.
  In this work we suggest a simple and robust super-resolution framework that
can be applied to single images and easily extended to video. Our work relies
on the observation that denoising of images and videos is well-managed and very
effectively treated by a variety of methods. We exploit the Plug-and-Play-Prior

VBM3D video denoiser, we obtain a strongly competitive motion-estimation free
VSR algorithm, showing tendency to a high-quality output and fast processing.

Thanks to the large collecting power of the Large Millimeter Telescope, a
prominent line arising from the 12CO(1-0) transition was revealed in recent
observations of this source. The complex profile is composed by a narrow
double-peak line and a broad wing. While the double-peak structure may be
arising in a disk of molecular material, the broad wing is interpreted as the
signature of a massive outflow of molecular gas with an approximate bulk
velocity of -660 km/s. This molecular wind is likely associated to a
multi-component X-ray Ultra-Fast Outflow with velocities reaching up to ~0.1c
and column densities in the range 10^{21-23.9} cm^-2 that was reported in the
source prior to the LMT observations. The momentum load estimated in the two
gas phases indicates that within the observational uncertainties the outflow is
consistent with being propagating through the galaxy and sweeping up the gas
while conserving its energy. This scenario, which has been often postulated as
a viable mechanism of how AGN feedback takes place, has so far been observed
only in ULIRGs sources. IRAS 17020+4544 with bolometric and infrared luminosity
respectively of 5X10^{44} erg/s and 1.05X10^{11} L_sun appears to be an example

such example is the often reported occurrence of stable planar faults (PFs) in

the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) of {110} planes in various bcc
metals with material models of increasing sophistication, i.e., (modified)
embedded atom method, angular-dependent, Tersoff, and bond-order potentials as
well as density functional theory. We show that under applied tensile strains
the GSFE curves of many classical potentials exhibit a local minimum which
gives rise to the formation of stable PFs. These PFs do not appear when more
sophisticated material models are used and have thus to be regarded as
artifacts of the potentials. We demonstrate that the local GSFE minimum is not
formed for reasons of symmetry and we recommend including the determination of
the strain-dependent (110) GSFE as a benchmark for newly developed potentials.

line-of-sight vp. Existing viewshed algorithms differ widely in what points
they chose to interpolate and how they interpolate the terrain. These choices
crucially affect the running time and accuracy of the algorithms. This paper
describes I/O-efficient algorithms for computing visibility maps in a couple of
different models.
  First, we describe two algorithms that sweep the terrain by rotating a ray
around the viewpoint while maintaining the terrain profile along the ray.
Second, we describe an algorithm which sweeps the terrain centrifugally,
growing a star-shaped region around the viewpoint while maintaining the
approximate visible horizon of the terrain within the swept region. Our last
two algorithms are based on computing and merging horizons. All algorithms are
I/O-efficient in the I/O-model of Aggarwal and Vitter. We present an
experimental analysis on large terrains obtained from NASA SRTM data. All our
algorithms are scalable to volumes of data that are over 50 times larger than

smaller than their theoretical worst case bound, which makes horizon-based
approaches very fast. Our last two algorithms, which compute the most accurate
viewshed, turn out to be very fast in practice, although their worst-case bound
is inferior.

theorem, its prehistory and a few of its further generalizations, and a modern
technique used in proving these and similar results, which is based on

main part of the paper is devoted to the topologizability problem of a wide
class of algebraic structures called polyrings; this class includes Abelian
groups, rings, modules, algebras over a ring, differential rings, and others.
We show that the Zariski topology on such an algebra is always non-discrete.
Actually, a much stronger fact holds: if $K$ is an infinite polyring, $n$ a
natural number, and a map $F$ of $K^n$ into $K$ is defined by a term in $n$
variables, then $F$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of the space $K^{n+1}$
with its Zariski topology. In particular, $K^n$ is a closed nowhere dense
subset of $K^{n+1}$. The proof essentially uses a multidimensional version of
Hindman's finite sums theorem established by Bergelson and Hindman. The third
part of the paper lists several problems concerning topologization of various
algebraic structures, their Zariski topologies, and some related questions.

relationships between a response and covariates. A prime example are
generalized additive models where splines (say) are used to approximate
non-linear functional components in conjunction with a quadratic penalty to
control for overfitting. Estimation and inference are then generally performed
based on the penalized likelihood, or under a mixed model framework. The
penalized likelihood framework is fast but potentially unstable, and choosing
the smoothing parameters needs to be done externally using cross-validation,
for instance. The mixed model framework tends to be more stable and offers a
natural way for choosing the smoothing parameters, but for non-normal responses
involves an intractable integral.
  In this article, we introduce a new framework for semiparametric regression
based on variational approximations. The approach possesses the stability and
natural inference tools of the mixed model framework, while achieving
computation times comparable to using penalized likelihood. Focusing on
generalized additive models, we derive fully tractable variational likelihoods
for some common response types. We present several features of the variational
approximation framework for inference, including a variational information
matrix for inference on parametric components, and a closed-form update for
estimating the smoothing parameter. We demonstrate the consistency of the
variational approximation estimates, and an asymptotic normality result for the
parametric component of the model. Simulation studies show the variational
approximation framework performs similarly to and sometimes better than
currently available software for fitting generalized additive models.

bi-directional long-short-term memory units in a residual structure. It learns
the time-frequency characteristics of the dominant phases in an earthquake

with an F-score of 99.95. The robustness of the trained model with respect to

important insights. However, it may not be appropriate in a multipath fading

experiences weak fading. Since the ranking of users in a NOMA system has a
direct impact on coverage probability analysis, impact of the traditional

distance-based ranking, which is easier to implement compared to instantaneous

this end, in this paper, we derive the probability of the event when
distance-based ranking yields the same results as instantaneous signal

dictionary atoms in the form of cover tree structures and adopt the
corresponding fast approximate nearest neighbour searches to accelerate
matched-filtering. For datasets belonging to smooth low-dimensional manifolds
cover trees offer search complexities logarithmic in terms of data population.
With this motivation we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm, named
CoverBLIP, to address large-size MRF problems where the fingerprint dictionary

parameters. We study different forms of convergence for this algorithm and we
show that provided with a notion of embedding, the inexact and non-convex
iterations of CoverBLIP linearly convergence toward a near-global solution with
the same order of accuracy as using exact brute-force searches. Our further
examinations on both synthetic and real-world datasets and using different
sampling strategies, indicates between 2 to 3 orders of magnitude reduction in
total search computations. Cover trees are robust against the
curse-of-dimensionality and therefore CoverBLIP provides a notion of
scalability -- a consistent gain in time-accuracy performance-- for searching
high-dimensional atoms which may not be easily preprocessed (i.e. for
dimensionality reduction) due to the increasing degrees of non-linearities

these trajectories are tracked using an adaptive PD controller. The method
results in a stable and robust control policy that is able to track variable

powerful CCD controller which can handle a wide range of scientific detectors.
Based on an easily scalable modular backplane architecture consisting of Single
Board Controllers (SBC), IDSAC can control large detector arrays and mosaics.
Each of the SBCs offers the full functionality required to control a CCD
independently. The SBCs can be cold swapped without the need to reconfigure
them. Each SBC can handle data from up to four video channels with or without
dummy outputs at speeds up to 500 kilo Pixels Per Second (kPPS) Per Channel
with a resolution of 16 bits. Communication with Linux based host computer is
through a USB3.0 interface, with the option of using copper or optical fibers.
A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used as the master controller in each
SBC which allows great flexibility in optimizing performance by adjusting gain,
timing signals, bias levels, etc. using user-editable configuration files
without altering the circuit topology. Elimination of thermal kTC noise is
achieved via Digital Correlated Double Sampling (DCDS). We present the results
of noise performance characterization of IDSAC through simulation, theoretical
modeling, and actual measurements. The contribution of different types of noise
sources is modeled using a tool to predict noise of a generic DCDS signal chain
analytically. The analytical model predicts the net input referenced noise of
the signal chain to be 5 electrons for 200k pixels per second per channel
readout rate with 3 samples per pixel. Using a cryogenic test set up in the
lab, the noise is measured to be 5.4 e (24.3 \muV), for the same readout
configuration.

respondent behavior. In this paper, we assess the extent to which survey gender
modifies average survey responses in the context of health-focused household
surveys.
  We pool data from four recent health-focused household surveys using both
male and female surveyors: Burkina Faso (2014), Cameroon (2012), Central
African Republic (2012), and Republic of Congo (2014). In all surveys,
surveyors were pre-assigned to households based on an initial household
listing. We compare responses given to male and female surveyors across three
domains: household characteristics, child mortality and reproductive health.
Multivariable regression with enumeration area fixed-effects were used to
estimate response differentials.
  A total of 22,835 household surveys were analyzed. The proportion of
interviews conducted by female interviews varied between 9 percent in Central
African Republic and 52 percent in Cameroon. Female surveyor gender increased
the odds of reporting asset ownership by 9.4% (OR 1.094, 95% CI: 1.024,1.169)
and increased the odds of reporting a pregnancy-related event by 25% (OR 1.246
(95% CI: 1.12,1.393). Being interviewed by a woman increased the odds of
respondents reporting a stillbirth by 29% (95% CI: 1.118,1.492), and the odds
of reporting a miscarriage by 17% (95% CI: 1.072,1.284). Substantial
heterogeneity in gender-specific reporting was found across the four countries.
We did not find evidence that the gender of the participant modified the effect
of surveyor gender for household items.
  Our results suggest that surveyor gender is highly predictive of survey
responses. For health surveys, female surveyors are likely to receive more
accurate and consistent responses. More generally, social distance between
interviewers and interviewees should be minimized in large scale surveys.

apical or basal surface and is subsequently squeezed out of the monolayer by
neighboring cells. Cell extrusions occur during apoptosis,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or pre-cancerous cell invasion. They play
important roles in embryogenesis, homeostasis, carcinogenesis, and many other
biological processes. Although many of the molecular factors involved in cell
extrusion are known, little is known about the mechanical basis of cell
extrusion. We used a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model to investigate the
mechanical stability of cells arranged in a monolayer with 3D foam geometry. We
found that when the cells composing the monolayer have homogeneous mechanical
properties, cells are extruded from the monolayer when the symmetry of the 3D
geometry is broken due to an increase in cell density or a decrease in the
number of topological neighbors around single cells. Those results suggest that
mechanical instability inherent in the 3D foam geometry of epithelial
monolayers is sufficient to drive epithelial cell extrusion. In the situation
where cells in the monolayer actively generate contractile or adhesive forces
under the control of intrinsic genetic programs, the forces act to break the
symmetry of the monolayer, leading to cell extrusion that is directed to the
apical or basal side of the monolayer by the balance of contractile and
adhesive forces on the apical and basal sides. Although our analyses are based
on a simple mechanical model, our results are in accordance with observations
of epithelial monolayers {\it in vivo} and consistently explain cell extrusions
under a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Our
results illustrate the importance of a mechanical understanding of cell
extrusion and provide a basis by which to link molecular regulation to physical

Mass segregation within a cluster promotes massive stars to be captured by the
central IMBH occasionally, causing tidal disruption events (TDEs). We find that
the TDE rate scales with the IMBH mass as $\dot{N}_{\rm TDE}\sim0.3\,{\rm
Myr}^{-1}(M_{\rm IMBH}/1000\,{\rm M}_{\odot})^2$. The DM component affects the
star cluster evolution by stripping stars from the outer part. When the DM
density within the cluster increases, the velocity dispersion of the stars
increases, and then the TDE rate decreases. By the TDEs, the central IMBHs grow
to as massive as $700-2500\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ in 15 million years. The IMBHs are
possible seeds for the formation of supermassive BHs observed at $z\gtrsim

is compared to the quantum variance for the staggered magnetization operators

monochromatic (i.e., high TC length) light sources like laser cannot be
implemented to acquire high resolution optically sectioned images of the
specimen. Contrary to this, pseudo thermal light source having high TC and low
spatial coherence (SC) property can be employed to achieve high axial
resolution comparable to broadband light source. In the present letter, a
pseudo thermal light source is synthesized by passing a purely monochromatic
laser beam through a rotating diffuser. The longitudinal coherence (LC)
property of the pseudo thermal light source is studied as a function of source
size and TC length. The LC length of the synthesized light source decreased as
the source size increased. It is found that LC length of such light source
becomes independent of the parent laser TC length for source size of greater
than or equal to 3.3 mm and become almost constant at around 30 micron for both
the lasers. Thus any monochromatic laser light source can be utilized to obtain
high axial resolution in OCT system irrespective of its TC length. The maximum
achievable axial resolution is found to be equal to 650 nm corresponding to 1.2
numerical aperture (NA) objective lens at 632 nm wavelength. The findings
elucidate that pseudo thermal source being monochromatic in nature can improve

(PDFs) is that PDF uncertainties do not include any source of theoretical
uncertainty. Here we present a general method for incorporating theoretical
uncertainties into PDF fits, focussing in particular on perturbative missing
higher order uncertainties (MHOUs). We consider two methods for estimating the
effect of MHOUs on PDFs, both based on scale variations. Firstly, we present
PDF fits based on theoretical predictions with varied scales, and use these to
estimate the associated MHOUs. Secondly, we discuss the construction of a
theoretical covariance matrix using scale variations, and its combination with
the experimental covariance matrix currently used in PDF fits.

the performance of multi-core in-memory transactional systems. However, the
focus has mainly been on low-contention workloads. Modern transactional systems
perform poorly on workloads with transactions accessing a few highly contended
data items. We observe that most transactional workloads, including those with
high contention, can be divided into clusters of data conflict-free
transactions and a small set of residuals. In this paper, we introduce a new
concurrency control protocol called Strife that leverages the above
observation. Strife executes transactions in batches, where each batch is
partitioned into clusters of conflict-free transactions and a small set of
residual transactions. The conflict-free clusters are executed in parallel
without any concurrency control, followed by executing the residual cluster
either serially or with concurrency control. We present a low-overhead
algorithm that partitions a batch of transactions into clusters that do not
have cross-cluster conflicts and a small residual cluster. We evaluate Strife
against the optimistic concurrency control protocol and several variants of
two-phase locking, where the latter is known to perform better than other
concurrency protocols under high contention, and show that Strife can improve
transactional throughput by up to 2x. We also perform an in-depth
micro-benchmark analysis to empirically characterize the performance and
quality of our clustering algorithm

the linear magnetoresistance and field-$T$ resistance scaling observed in

investigate how this feedback impacts the mechanical properties of model jammed

poorly-coordinated regions, resulting in an excess number of cell-cell contacts

post-process this score to obtain a binary decision. We study the feasibility
of achieving various fairness properties by post-processing calibrated scores,
and then show that deferring post-processors allow for more fairness conditions

  1. There does not exist a general way to post-process a calibrated classifier
to equalize protected groups' positive or negative predictive value (PPV or
NPV). For certain ""nice"" calibrated classifiers, either PPV or NPV can be
equalized when the post-processor uses different thresholds across protected
groups, though there exist distributions of calibrated scores for which the two
measures cannot be both equalized. When the post-processing consists of a
single global threshold across all groups, natural fairness properties, such as
equalizing PPV in a nontrivial way, do not hold even for ""nice"" classifiers.
  2. When the post-processing is allowed to `defer' on some decisions (that is,
to avoid making a decision by handing off some examples to a separate process),
then for the non-deferred decisions, the resulting classifier can be made to
equalize PPV, NPV, false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR)
across the protected groups. This suggests a way to partially evade the
impossibility results of Chouldechova and Kleinberg et al., which preclude
equalizing all of these measures simultaneously. We also present different
deferring strategies and show how they affect the fairness properties of the

non-relativistic approximation of planar quantum electrodynamics (${\rm

potentials. The analysis is motivated keeping in mind the fact that
parity-preserving ${\rm QED}_3$ models can provide a possible explanation for
the behavior of superconductors. Initially, we study the self-adjointness and
spectral properties of the Schr\""odinger operator modeling the non-relativistic
approximation of these ${\rm QED}_3$ models. Then, by using {\em Set\^o-type
estimates}, an estimate is derived of the number of two-particle bound states
which depends directly on the value of the effective coupling constant, $C$,
for {\em any} value of the angular momentum. In fact, this result in connection
with the condition that guarantees the self-adjointness of the Schr\""odinger
operator shows that there can always be a large number of two-quasiparticle
bound states in planar quantum electrodynamics models. In particular, we show
the existence of an isolated two-quasiparticle bound state if the effective
coupling constant $C \in (0,2)$ in case of zero angular momentum. To the best
of our knowledge, this result has not yet been addressed in the literature.
Additionally, we obtain an explicit estimate for the energy gap of

Unsupervised learning seeks to detect block structures in the adjacency matrix
$Z$ between $L$ and $R$, thus grouping together sets of agents with similar
object interactions. New results on quasirandom permutations suggest a
non-parametric \textbf{four point test} to measure the amount of block
structure in $G$, with respect to vertex orderings on $L$ and $R$. Take
disjoint 4-edge random samples, order these four edges by left endpoint, and
count the relative frequencies of the $4!$ possible orderings of the right
endpoint. When these orderings are equiprobable, the edge set $E$ corresponds
to a quasirandom permutation $\pi$ of $|E|$ symbols. Total variation distance
of the relative frequency vector away from the uniform distribution on 24
permutations measures the amount of block structure. Such a test statistic,
based on $\lfloor |E|/4 \rfloor$ samples, is computable in $O(|E|/p)$ time on
$p$ processors. Possibly block structure may be enhanced by precomputing
\textbf{natural orders} on $L$ and $R$, related to the second eigenvector of

avoid command and control domains or IPs being seized or sinkholed. This means
that an infected system may attempt to access many domains in an attempt to
contact the command and control server. Therefore, the automatic detection of
DGA domains is an important task, both for the sake of blocking malicious
domains and identifying compromised hosts. However, many DGAs use English
wordlists to generate plausibly clean-looking domain names; this makes
automatic detection difficult. In this work, we devise a notion of difficulty
for DGA families called the smashword score; this measures how much a DGA
family looks like English words. We find that this measure accurately reflects
how much a DGA family's domains look like they are made from natural English
words. We then describe our new modeling approach, which is a combination of a
novel recurrent neural network architecture with domain registration side
information. Our experiments show the model is capable of effectively
identifying domains generated by difficult DGA families. Our experiments also
show that our model outperforms existing approaches, and is able to reliably
detect difficult DGA families such as matsnu, suppobox, rovnix, and others. The
model's performance compared to the state of the art is best for DGA families
that resemble English words. We believe that this model could either be used in
a standalone DGA domain detector---such as an endpoint security
application---or alternately the model could be used as a part of a larger
malware detection system.

of the CVE we present two different derivation in the Wigner function approach.
The first one is based on the method in our previous work \cite{Gao:2012ix} in
which the CVE was derived under static-equilibrium conditions without details.
We provide a detailed derivation using a more transparent and powerful method,
which can be easily generalized to higher order calculation. In this derivation
of the CVE current, there is an explicit Lorentz covariance. The second
derivation is based on a more general chiral kinetic theory in a semi-classical
expansion of the Wigner function without assuming static-equilibrium conditions
\cite{Gao:2018wmr}. In this derivation, there is a freedom to choose a
reference frame for the CVE current, so the explicit Lorentz covariance seems
to be lost. Howerver, under static-equilibrium conditions, we show that the CVE
current in this derivation can be decomposed into two parts, identified as the
normal and magnetization current. Each part depends on the reference frame, but
the sum of two parts does give the total CVE current which is independent of
the reference frame. In the comoving frame of the fluid, it can be shown that
the normal and magnetization current give one-third and two-thirds of the total
CVE current respectively. This gives a natural solution to the 'one-third'
puzzle in the CVE current in three-dimensional version of the chiral kinetic
theory in the literature.

challenges to genomic research. Identifying genes with differential expression
between different species is an effective way to discover evolutionarily
conserved transcriptional responses. To remove systematic variation between
different species for a fair comparison, the normalization procedure serves as
a crucial pre-processing step that adjusts for the varying sample sequencing
depths and other confounding technical effects.
  Results: In this paper, we propose a scale based normalization (SCBN) method
by taking into account the available knowledge of conserved orthologous genes
and hypothesis testing framework. Considering the different gene lengths and
unmapped genes between different species, we formulate the problem from the
perspective of hypothesis testing and search for the optimal scaling factor
that minimizes the deviation between the empirical and nominal type I errors.
Conclusions: Simulation studies show that the proposed method performs
significantly better than the existing competitor in a wide range of settings.
An RNA-seq dataset of different species is also analyzed and it coincides with
the conclusion that the proposed method outperforms the existing method. For
practical applications, we have also developed an R package named ""SCBN"" and

animation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks and mesh-based
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Synthesizing realistic 3D mesh animation
sequences is a challenging and important task in computer animation. To achieve
this, researchers have long been focusing on shape analysis to develop new
interpolation and extrapolation techniques. However, such techniques have
limited learning capabilities and therefore can produce unrealistic animation.
Deep architectures that operate directly on mesh sequences remain unexplored,
due to the following major barriers: meshes with irregular triangles, sequences
containing rich temporal information and flexible deformations. To address
these, we utilize convolutional neural networks defined on triangular meshes
along with a shape deformation representation to extract useful features,
followed by LSTM cells that iteratively process the features. To allow
completion of a missing mesh sequence from given endpoints, we propose a new
weight-shared bidirectional structure. The bidirectional generation loss also
helps mitigate error accumulation over iterations. Benefiting from all these
technical advances, our approach outperforms existing methods in sequence
prediction and completion both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, this
network can also generate follow-up frames conditioned on initial shapes and
improve the accuracy as more bootstrap models are provided, which other works
in the geometry processing domain cannot achieve.

labeled endpoints, we call them {\it multiwords}. At least, this gives a
concrete and intuitive representation of ACG.
  A key observation is that the class of multiwords has a fundamental algebraic
structure. Namely, multiwords can be organized in a category, very similar to
the category of topological cobordisms. This category is symmetric monoidal
closed and compact closed and thus is a model of linear $\lambda$-calculus and
classical linear logic. We think that this category is interesting on its own
right. In particular, it might provide categorical representation for other
formalisms.
  On the other hand, many models of language semantics are based on commutative
logic or, more generally, on symmetric monoidal closed categories. But the
category of {\it word cobordisms} is a category of language elements, which is
itself symmetric monoidal closed and independent of any grammar. Thus, it might
prove useful in understanding language semantics as well.

examine how efficient electric resistivity and resonant absorption in the cusp
continuum can be for damping SSSMs in a photospheric waveguide with equilibrium
parameters compatible with recent measurements of a photospheric pore. For
SSSMs with the measured wavelength, we find that the damping rate due to the
cusp resonance is substantially less strong than theoretically expected with
the thin-boundary approximation. The damping-time-to-period ratio ($\tau/P$) we
derive for standing modes, equivalent to the damping-length-to-wavelength ratio
for propagating modes given the extremely weak dispersion, can reach only $\sim
180$. However, the accepted values for electric resistivity ($\eta$) correspond
to a regime where both the cusp resonance and resistivity play a role. The
values for $\tau/P$ attained at the largest allowed $\eta$ may reach $\sim 30$.
We conclude that electric resistivity can be considerably more efficient than
the cusp resonance for damping SSSMs in the pore in question, and it needs to
be incorporated into future studies on the damping of SSSMs in photospheric

to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic

  Our analysis relies on the following observation: over-parameterization and
random initialization jointly restrict every weight vector to be close to its
initialization for all iterations, which allows us to exploit a strong
convexity-like property to show that gradient descent converges at a global
linear rate to the global optimum. We believe these insights are also useful in

resonant localized plasmons can result in a strong coupling of excitonic states
or formation of hybrid exciton-plasmon modes in quantum confined structures.
This coupling can be strengthed by designing a system with its vibronic states
resonant to the energy of the driving field induced by the localized plasmon
excitation. Silver nanoislands nucleated on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an
ideal platform for such interaction. The influence of localized plasmons (LSP)
on the formation and dissociation of excitons due to resonant and off-resonant
optical excitation of carriers to excitonic states is studied using ultrafast
optical spectroscopy. The local field due to the Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NP)
enhances the magnitude of the Raman modes in MoS2 in the presence of resonant
excitation. An ultrashort pulsed optical excitation at 2.3 eV resonantly
excites the LSP modes and the optical near-field resonantly drive the phonon
modes, which leads to a coherent coupling of the A and B excitons in MoS2 with
the plasmon modes. The resonant excitation of the LSP modes modulate the
optical absorption of the probe field. The resonant excitation of C exciton due
to an excitation source at 3.0 eV, which is off-resonant to the LSP mode
increases the electrostatic screening in the presence of excess carriers from
Ag NPs. It results in a faster dissociation of optically generated C excitons
into free carriers that eventually increase the A and B exciton population. A
3-level density matrix theory in the presence of dressed vibronic states
induced by a localized near-field optical driving source is applied to describe
the coherent interaction process in the hybrid nano-plasmonic system.

clustering problem are established in this paper. Among other things, we
clarify the solution existence, properties of the global solutions,
characteristic properties of the local solutions, locally Lipschitz property of
the optimal value function, locally upper Lipschitz property of the global
solution map, and the Aubin property of the local solution map. We prove that
the problem in question always has a global solution and, under a mild
condition, the global solution set is finite and the components of each global
solution can be computed by an explicit formula. Based on a newly introduced
concept of nontrivial local solution, we get necessary conditions for a system
of centroids to be a nontrivial local solution. Interestingly, we are able to
show that these necessary conditions are also sufficient ones. Finally, it is
proved that the optimal value function is locally Lipschitz, the global
solution map is locally upper Lipschitz, and the local solution map has the
Aubin property, provided that the original data points are pairwise distinct.
Thanks to the obtained complete characterizations of the nontrivial local
solutions, one can understand better the performance of not only the $k$-means

comprehensive investigation of the QCSE as a function of the applied electric

attributed to a strong confinement of the ground-state hole wave functions due
to the presence of Bi clusters. At technologically-relevant large Bi fractions

to be weak, leading to a quadratic Stark shift of the ground-state transition

this paper, we propose a data Partitioning-based Intrusion Management System

that IBDP is NP-hard. Accordingly, two heuristic solutions for IBDP are

that intelligent partitioning of data tuples improves the overall availability

investigated. In flat spacetime, the Fierz-Pauli model is well-known as the
unique linear theory describing the massive spin-two field. On the other hand,
in order to construct the massive spin-two theory in fixed curved background
with arbitrary metric, infinite series of nonminimal coupling terms are
necessary. In [Nucl. Phys. B 584 (2000) 615], Buchbinder et al. have derived
the condition for the ghost-freeness and they have solved the condition in
small curvature approximation. In the leading order approximation, three free
parameters of the leading order nonminimal coupling terms are allowed. However,
existence of the completion corresponding to all the three parameters is not
guaranteed. On the other hand, recently, a class of the completion is obtained
by linearizing the dRGT model. However, the leading order nonminimal coupling
terms of the linearized dRGT model depend only on one free parameter.
Therefore, possibility of a class larger than the linearized dRGT model has not
been excluded. In this paper, we develop the method for solving the conditions
for ghost freeness in higher order and investigate whether lower order
nonminimal coupling terms can be constrained by higher order conditions or not.
As a result, we obtain an additional constraint on the leading order nonminimal
coupling terms from the fourth order condition. Although the leading order
nonminimal coupling terms of the linearized dRGT model is still a subclass of
our resulting nonminimal coupling terms in the leading order, a trivial
extension of the linearized dRGT model is perfectly equivalent to our resulting

storage overhead. However, a large amount of computation redundancy still
exists in BNN inference. By analyzing local properties of images and the
learned BNN kernel weights, we observe an average of $\sim$78% input similarity
and $\sim$59% weight similarity among weight kernels, measured by our proposed
metric in common network architectures. Thus there does exist redundancy that
can be exploited to further reduce the amount of on-chip computations.
  Motivated by the observation, in this paper, we proposed two types of fast
and energy-efficient architectures for BNN inference. We also provide analysis
and insights to pick the better strategy of these two for different datasets
and network models. By reusing the results from previous computation, much
cycles for data buffer access and computations can be skipped. By experiments,
we demonstrate that 80% of the computation and 40% of the buffer access can be
skipped by exploiting BNN similarity. Thus, our design can achieve 17%
reduction in total power consumption, 54% reduction in on-chip power
consumption and 2.4$\times$ maximum speedup, compared to the baseline without
applying our reuse technique. Our design also shows 1.9$\times$ more

Chaotic-like neuron dynamics has been observed in the brain, and it is
desirable in some neuromorphic computing applications whereas it should be

due to scarcity of annotated video frames. Having a robust video object
detector is an essential component for video understanding and curating
large-scale automated annotations in videos. Domain difference between images
and videos makes the transferability of image object detectors to videos
sub-optimal. The most common solution is to use weakly supervised annotations
where a video frame has to be tagged for presence/absence of object categories.
This still takes up manual effort. In this paper we take a step forward by
adapting the concept of unsupervised adversarial image-to-image translation to
perturb static high quality images to be visually indistinguishable from a set
of video frames. We assume the presence of a fully annotated static image
dataset and an unannotated video dataset. Object detector is trained on
adversarially transformed image dataset using the annotations of the original

with two contemporary baseline object detectors reveal that such unsupervised
pixel level domain adaptation boosts the generalization performance on video
frames compared to direct application of original image object detector. Also,
we achieve competitive performance compared to recent baselines of weakly

translation for cross domain object detection.

outskirts of nearby galaxies, we conduct deep and wide-field imaging survey
with KMTNet. We present our observing strategy and optimal data reduction
process to recover the faint extended features in the imaging data of NGC 1291
taken with KMTNet. Through the dark sky flat-fielding and optimal sky
subtraction, we can effectively remove inhomogeneous patterns. In the combined
images, the peak-to-peak global sky gradients were reduced to less than
$\sim0.5$% and $\sim0.3$% of the original $B$- and $R$-band sky levels,
respectively. However, we find local spatial fluctuations in the background sky
which can affect the precise measurement of the sky value. Consequently, we can
reach the surface brightness of $\mu_{B,1\sigma} \sim$ 29.5 and
$\mu_{R,1\sigma}\sim$ 28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in azimuthally averaged
one-dimensional surface brightness profiles, that is mainly limited by the
uncertainty in the sky determination. These results suggest that the deep
imaging data produced by KMTNet are suitable to study the faint features of
nearby galaxies such as outer disks and dwarf companions, but unideal (not
impossible) to detect stellar halos. The one-dimensional profile revealed that
NGC 1291 appeared to have Type I disk out to $R$ $\sim$ 30 kpc with no obvious
color gradient and excess light due to a stellar halo was undetected.

method is applied to coarsely separate chaotic and jamming signals. After that,
the WPD method is used to finely estimate and mitigate jamming signals that
exist on all outputs of the ICA method. Finally, an inverse ICA procedure is
carried out, followed by a summation, and the outcome is passed through the
conventional correlation-based receiver for recovering the transmitted

significant system performance enhancement compared to that given by the
conventional correlation-based receiver with WPD, i.e. 8 dB gain at BER =0.03

of a scalar potential with a positive energy density in a low energy effective

the cosmological constant. The local maximum of the Higgs potential at the
symmetric point also contradicts with the conjecture. In order to make the
Standard Model consistent with the conjecture, it has been proposed to
introduce a quintessence field, $Q$, which couples to the cosmological constant
and the local maximum of the Higgs potential. In this paper, we show that such
a modified Higgs potential generically results in a $Q$-dependent Higgs vacuum
expectation value (VEV). The $Q$-dependence of the Higgs VEV induces a
long-range force, which is severely excluded by the tests of the equivalence
principle. Besides, as the quintessence field is in motion, the Higgs VEV shows
a time-dependence, which is also severely constrained by the measurements of
the time-dependence of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Those constraints
require an additional fine-tuning which is justified neither by the swampland
conjecture nor the anthropic principle. We further show that, even if such an
unjustified fine-tuning condition is imposed at the tree level, radiative
corrections upset it. Consequently, we argue that most of the habitable vacua

is monitored at constant time intervals; and ii) the mesoscale, in which it is
monitored only when the particle crosses a boundary between compartments. Both
descriptions provide --by construction-- the same long time behavior. The
analytical description obtained at the proposed mesoscale allows for a complete
characterization of the complex movement at the microscale, thus representing a
fruitful approach for this kind of systems. We show that the presence of
disorder in the transmittances is a necessary condition to induce anomalous
diffusion, whereas the spatial heterogeneity reduces the degree of subdiffusion
and, in some cases, can even compensate for the disorder induced by the
stochastic transmittance.

that assigns syntactic trees to texts. Due to the wider availability of
dependency corpora and improved parsing and machine learning techniques,
parsing accuracies of supervised learning-based systems have been significantly
improved. However, due to the nature of supervised learning, those parsing
systems highly rely on the manually annotated training corpora. They work
reasonably good on the in-domain data but the performance drops significantly
when tested on out-of-domain texts. To bridge the performance gap between
in-domain and out-of-domain, this thesis investigates three semi-supervised
techniques for out-of-domain dependency parsing, namely co-training,
self-training and dependency language models. Our approaches use easily
obtainable unlabelled data to improve out-of-domain parsing accuracies without
the need of expensive corpora annotation. The evaluations on several English
domains and multi-lingual data show quite good improvements on parsing
accuracy. Overall this work conducted a survey of semi-supervised methods for
out-of-domain dependency parsing, where I extended and compared a number of
important semi-supervised methods in a unified framework. The comparison
between those techniques shows that self-training works equally well as
co-training on out-of-domain parsing, while dependency language models can
improve both in- and out-of-domain accuracies.

of the Cassie state are exploited for self-cleaning, drug delivery etc., while
in the Wenzel state most of these properties are lost; it is therefore of
fundamental and technological interest to investigate the kinetics and
mechanism of the Cassie-Wenzel transition. Computationally, the Cassie-Wenzel
transition is often investigated using enhanced sampling techniques based on
the use of collective variables (CVs). The choice of the CVs is a crucial task
because it affects the free-energy profile, the estimation of the free-energy
barriers, and the evaluation of the mechanism of the process. Here we
investigate possible simulation artifacts introduced by common CVs adopted for
the study of the Cassie-Wenzel transition: the average particle density in the
corrugation of a textured surface and the coarse grained density field at
various levels of coarse graining. We also investigate possible additional
artifacts associated to finite size effects. We focus on a pillared surface. We
show that the use of the average density of fluid in the interpillar region
brings to severe artifacts in the relative Cassie-Wenzel stability and in the
transition barrier. A proper description of the wetting mechanism and its
energetics requires a rather fine discretization of the density field.
Concerning the finite size effects, we have found that the typical system
employed in the Cassie-Wenzel transition, containing a single pillar within
periodic boundary conditions, prevents the break of translational symmetry of
the liquid-vapor meniscus during the process.

reconfiguration problem, in which there are two maximal independent sets for
which every node is given its membership status, and the nodes need to
communicate with their neighbors in order to find a reconfiguration schedule
that switches from the first MIS to the second. Such a schedule is a list of
independent sets that is restricted by forbidding two neighbors to change their
membership status at the same step. In addition, these independent sets should
provide some covering guarantee. We show that obtaining an actual MIS (and even
a 3-dominating set) in each intermediate step is impossible. However, we
provide efficient solutions when the intermediate sets are only required to be
independent and 4-dominating, which is almost always possible, as we fully
characterize. Consequently, our goal is to pin down the tradeoff between the
possible length of the schedule and the number of communication rounds. We
prove that a constant length schedule can be found in
$O(\texttt{MIS}+\texttt{R32})$ rounds, where $\texttt{MIS}$ is the complexity
of finding an MIS in a worst-case graph and $\texttt{R32}$ is the complexity of

EEG amplifiers, headsets, and electrodes providing objective recommendation for
a given application. The framework covers: data collection paradigm, data
analysis, and statistical framework. To illustrate, data was collected from 12
different devices totaling up to 6 subjects per device. Two data acquisition
protocols were implemented: a resting-state protocol eyes-open (EO) and
eyes-closed (EC), and an Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) protocol.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on alpha band (EO/EC) and Event Related Potential
(ERP) were extracted as objective quantification of physiologically meaningful
information. Then, visual representation, univariate statistical analysis, and
multivariate model were performed to increase results interpretability.
Objective criteria show that the spectral SNR in alpha does not provide much
discrimination between systems, suggesting that the acquisition quality might
not be of primary importance for spectral and specifically alpha-based
applications. On the contrary, AEP SNR proved much more variable stressing the
importance of the acquisition setting for ERP experiments. The multivariate
analysis identified some individuals and some systems as independent
statistically significant contributors to the SNR. It highlights the importance
of inter-individual differences in neurophysiological experiments (sample size)
and suggests some device might objectively be superior to others when it comes
to ERP recordings. However, the illustration of the proposed benchmarking
framework suffers from severe limitations including small sample size and sound
card jitter in the auditory stimulations. While these limitations hinders a
definite ranking of the evaluated hardware, we believe the proposed
benchmarking framework to be a modest yet valuable contribution to the field.

optimal decisions of a district heating operator, and (ii) investigate the
market-wide effects of increasing emission prices, in particular the pass-
through from emission costs to electricity prices. Using a numerical model of
the common Austrian and German power system, we estimate a pass-through from
CO2 emission prices to power prices between 0.69 and 0.53 as of 2017, depending
on the absolute emission price level. We find the CO2 emission cost
pass-through to be sufficiently high so that low-emission district heating
systems operating at least moderately efficient generation units benefit from
rising CO2 emission prices in the short term.

cryostat and the finesse of the cavity was monitored for 35 days under
cryogenic conditions. We confirmed that the molecular adlayer was formed on a
cold mirror and caused an oscillation in the finesse. The real and imaginary
parts of the refractive index of the adlayer were $1.26 \pm 0.073$ and $2.2
\times 10^{-7} \pm 1.3 \times 10^{-7} $, respectively. These are considered to
be that of $\mathrm{H_2O}$ molecules. The formation rate of the molecular
adlayer was 27 $\pm$ 1.9 $\mathrm{nm/day}$. In this paper, we describe
theoretical and experimental studies of the formation of a molecular adlayer on
cryogenic mirrors. Furthermore, the effects of a molecular adlayer on the
quantum noise and the input heat to the test mass are also discussed.

improve such universality, the state-of-the-art consists in training networks

a method that exploits finer-classes than the most specific ones existing, for

the quality of the approximate solution to $Ax=b$ so that the CG algorithm can
be stopped when the required accuracy is reached. The relevant convergence
characteristics, like the $A$-norm of the error or the normwise backward error,
cannot be easily computed. However, they can be estimated. Such estimates often
depend on approximations of the smallest or largest eigenvalue of~$A$.
  In the paper we introduce a new upper bound for the $A$-norm of the error,
which is closely related to the Gauss-Radau upper bound, and discuss the
problem of choosing the parameter $\mu$ which should represent a lower bound
for the smallest eigenvalue of $A$.The new bound has several practical
advantages, the most important one is that it can be used as an approximation
to the $A$-norm of the error even if $\mu$ is not exactly a lower bound for the
smallest eigenvalue of $A$. In this case, $\mu$ can be chosen, e.g., as the
smallest Ritz value or its approximation. We also describe a very cheap
algorithm, based on the incremental norm estimation technique, which allows to
estimate the smallest and largest Ritz values during the CG computations. An
improvement of the accuracy of these estimates of extreme Ritz values is
possible, at the cost of storing the CG coefficients and solving a linear
system with a tridiagonal matrix at each CG iteration. Finally, we discuss how
to cheaply approximate the normwise backward error. The numerical experiments
demonstrate the efficiency of the estimates of the extreme Ritz values, and
show their practical use in error estimation in CG.

theory, have been intensively studied in the last decade as a powerful
formalism to represent ontological knowledge in the context of ontology-based
query answering. A knowledge base is then composed of an instance that contains
incomplete data and a set of existential rules, and answers to queries are
logically entailed from the knowledge base. This brought again to light the
fundamental chase tool, and its different variants that have been proposed in
the literature. It is well-known that the problem of determining, given a chase
variant and a set of existential rules, whether the chase will halt on any
instance, is undecidable. Hence, a crucial issue is whether it becomes
decidable for known subclasses of existential rules. In this work, we consider
linear existential rules, a simple yet important subclass of existential rules
that generalizes inclusion dependencies. We show the decidability of the all
instance chase termination problem on linear rules for three main chase
variants, namely semi-oblivious, restricted and core chase. To obtain these
results, we introduce a novel approach based on so-called derivation trees and
a single notion of forbidden pattern. Besides the theoretical interest of a
unified approach and new proofs, we provide the first positive decidability
results concerning the termination of the restricted chase, proving that chase
termination on linear existential rules is decidable for both versions of the

We study properties of filaments, PILs and coronal holes in solar cycles 20,

behavior of filament length, PIL length, and coronal hole area with significant
correspondence with the solar magnetic cycle. The spatio-temporal evolution of
the geometric centers of filaments shows a butterfly-like structure and
distinguishable pole-ward migration of long filaments during cycle maxima. We
identify this rush to the poles of filaments to be co-temporal with the
initiation of polar field reversal as gleaned from Mount Wilson and Wilcox
Solar Observatory polar field observations and quantitatively establish their
temporal correspondence. We analyze the filament tilt angle distribution to
constrain their possible origins. Majority of the filaments exhibit negative
and positive tilt angles in the northern and the southern hemispheres,
respectively -- strongly suggesting that their formation is governed by the
overall large-scale magnetic field distribution on the solar photosphere and
not by the small-scale intra-active region magnetic field configurations. We

co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become a core technique used in
today's working co-editors and adopted in major industrial products. CRDT
(Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around
2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up
CRDT variations are commonly labeled as ""post-OT"" techniques capable of making
concurrent operations natively commutative, and have made broad claims of
superiority over OT solutions, in terms of correctness, time and space
complexity, simplicity, etc. Over one decade later, however, CRDT solutions are
rarely found in working co-editors, while OT solutions remain the choice for
building the vast majority of co-editors. Contradictions between this reality
and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much debate and
confusion in co-editing research and developer communities. What is CRDT really
to co-editing? What are the real differences between OT and CRDT for
co-editors? What are the key factors that may have affected the adoption of and
choice between OT and CRDT for co-editors in the real world? In this paper, we
report our discoveries, in relation to these questions and beyond, from a
comprehensive review and comparison study on representative OT and CRDT
solutions and working co-editors based on them. Moreover, this work reveals
facts and presents evidences that refute CRDT claimed advantages over OT. We
hope the results reported in this paper will help clear up common myths,
misconceptions, and confusions surrounding alternative co-editing techniques,
and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.

the profile is bounded (remaining finite at $|x|\rightarrow \infty $), at a
critical value of the integral norm the spatially symmetric state loses its

  We study the question which logical laws axiomatize short-circuit evaluation
under the following assumptions: compound statements are evaluated from left to
right, each atom (propositional variable) evaluates to either true or false,
and atomic evaluations can cause a side effect. The answer to this question
depends on the kind of atomic side effects that can occur and leads to
different ""short-circuit logics"". The basic case is FSCL (free short-circuit
logic), which characterizes the setting in which each atomic evaluation can
cause a side effect. We recall some main results and then relate FSCL to MSCL
(memorizing short-circuit logic), where in the evaluation of a compound
statement, the first evaluation result of each atom is memorized. MSCL can be
seen as a sequential variant of propositional logic: atomic evaluations cannot
cause a side effect and the sequential connectives are not commutative. Then we
relate MSCL to SSCL (static short-circuit logic), the variant of propositional
logic that prescribes short-circuit evaluation with commutative sequential
connectives.

address whether 1I/'Oumuamua could be representative of this background
population of ejected objects. The purpose of the study of its origin is that
it could provide information about the building blocks of planets in a size
range that remains elusive to observations, helping to constrain planet
formation models. We compare the mass density of interstellar objects inferred
from its detection to that expected from planetesimal disks under two
scenarios: circumstellar disks around single stars and wide binaries, and
circumbinary disks around tight binaries. Our study makes use of a detailed
study of the PanSTARRS survey volume; takes into account that the contribution
from each star to the population of interstellar planetesimals depends on
stellar mass, binarity, and planet presence; and explores a wide range of
possible size distributions for the ejected planetesimals, based on solar
system models and observations of its small-body population. We find that
1I/'Oumuamua is unlikely to be representative of a population of isotropically
distributed objects, favoring the scenario that it originated from the
planetesimal disk of a young nearby star whose remnants are highly anisotropic.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of meteorites and micrometeorites observed on

concluding that it is unlikely that one of these objects is already part of the

rotational velocities). This fact raises a discussion about the contributing
processes, such as angular-momentum transfer and tidal forces. Aims. We seek to
constrain the physical and evolutionary status of one of such systems, the O+O
binary HD 93343. Methods. We analyzed a series of high-resolution multiepoch
optical spectra to determine the orbital parameters, projected rotational
velocities, and evolutionary status of the system. Results. HD 93343 is a
binary system comprised of two O7.5 Vz stars that each have minimum masses of
approximately 22 Mo in a wide and eccentric orbit (e = 0.398$\pm$0.004;
P=50.432$\pm$0.001 d). Both stars have very similar stellar parameters, and
hence ages. As expected from the qualitative appearance of the combined
spectrum of the system, however, these stars have very different projected
rotational velocities (~65 and ~325 km/s, respectively). Conclusions. The
orbits and stellar parameters obtained for both components seem to indicate
that their youth and relative separation is enough to discard the effects of
mass transfer and tidal friction. Thus, non-synchronization should be intrinsic

complex twisted linear superfield coupled to two sets of Abelian vector
superfields. In the IR regime, the GLSM provides a string sigma model whose
target spaces are a defect NS5-brane, a Kaluza-Klein vortex and an exotic
$5^2_2$-brane. All of them are five-branes of codimension two and are related
by T-duality. This model is a natural extension of the GLSM proposed by Tong
which gives a sigma model for an H-monopole, i.e., a smeared NS5-brane of
codimension three. This is also regarded as an alternative system of the GLSM
for exotic five-branes proposed by the present authors. In this analysis, we
confirm that the T-duality transformation procedure in terms of the complex
twisted linear superfield is applicable to dualize both the real and imaginary
parts of the twisted chiral superfield even at the UV level, beyond the IR
limit. This indicates that the T-duality transformations at finite gauge
couplings can be performed in terms of reducible superfields in the same way as
irreducible (twisted) chiral superfields. Furthermore, we study quantum vortex
corrections to the GLSM at the UV level. In the IR limit, these corrections are
mapped to string worldsheet instanton corrections to the five-branes of
codimension two. The result completely agrees with those in double field theory

The

a robust classifier, which will be tested on future adversarial examples. The
adversary is limited to $k$ possible corruptions for each input. We model the
learner-adversary interaction as a zero-sum game. This model is closely related
to the adversarial examples model of Schmidt et al. (2018); Madry et al.

  Our main results consist of generalization bounds for the binary and
multiclass classification, as well as the real-valued case (regression). For
the binary classification setting, we both tighten the generalization bound of
Feige et al. (2015), and are also able to handle infinite hypothesis classes.
The sample complexity is improved from
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^4}\log(\frac{|H|}{\delta}))$ to
$O\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}(kVC(H)\log^{\frac{3}{2}+\alpha}(kVC(H))+\log(\frac{1}{\delta})\big)$
for any $\alpha > 0$. Additionally, we extend the algorithm and generalization
bound from the binary to the multiclass and real-valued cases. Along the way,
we obtain results on fat-shattering dimension and Rademacher complexity of
$k$-fold maxima over function classes; these may be of independent interest.
  For binary classification, the algorithm of Feige et al. (2015) uses a regret
minimization algorithm and an ERM oracle as a black box; we adapt it for the

investigate quantum dots coupled to two superconducting leads in controlled and
tunable setups. The equilibrium Josephson current was measured in on-chip SQUID
devices and subgap states were investigated using weakly coupled metallic leads
for spectroscopy. This put back two ""classic"" problems also on the agenda of
theoretical condensed matter physics: the Josephson effect and quantum spins in
superconductors. We discuss the status of the theoretical understanding of the
Anderson-Josephson quantum dot in equilibrium mainly focusing on the Josephson
current. We introduce a minimal model consisting of a dot which can only host
one spin-up and one spin-down electron repelling each other by a local Coulomb
interaction. The dot is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads described
by the BCS Hamiltonian. This model was investigated using a variety of methods,
some capturing aspects of Kondo physics others failing in this respect. We
briefly review this. The model shows a first order level-crossing quantum phase
transition when varying any parameter provided the others are within
appropriate ranges. At vanishing temperature it leads to a jump of the
Josephson current. We show that a quantitative agreement between accurate
results obtained for the simple model and measurements of the current can be
reached. This confirms that the experiments reveal the finite temperature
signatures of the zero temperature transition. In addition, we consider two
examples of more complex dot geometries which might be experimentally realized
in the near future. The first is characterized by the interplay of the above
level-crossing physics and the Fano effect, the second by the interplay of
superconductivity and almost degenerate singlet and triplet two-body states.

such that $X \subseteq F^*$. A submonoid $M$ generated by $k$ elements of $A^*$
is $k$-maximal if there does not exist another submonoid generated by at most
$k$ words containing $M$. We call a set $X \subseteq A^*$ primitive if it is
the basis of a $|X|$-maximal submonoid. This extends the notion of primitive
word: indeed, $\{w\}$ is a primitive set if and only if $w$ is a primitive
word.
  By definition, for any set $X$, there exists a primitive set $Y$ such that $X
\subseteq Y^*$. The set $Y$ is therefore called a primitive root of $X$. As a
main result, we prove that if a set has rank $2$, then it has a unique
primitive root. This result cannot be extended to sets of rank larger than 2.
  For a single word $w$, we say that the set $\{x,y\}$ is a {\em binary root}
of $w$ if $w$ can be written as a concatenation of copies of $x$ and $y$ and
$\{x,y\}$ is a primitive set. We prove that every primitive word $w$ has at
most one binary root $\{x,y\}$ such that $|x|+|y|<\sqrt{|w|}$. That is, the
binary root of a word is unique provided the length of the word is sufficiently
large with respect to the size of the root.
  Our results are also compared to previous approaches that investigate
pseudo-repetitions, where a morphic involutive function $\theta$ is defined on
$A^*$. In this setting, the notions of $\theta$-power, $\theta$-primitive and
$\theta$-root are defined, and it is shown that any word has a unique
$\theta$-primitive root. This result can be obtained with our approach by
showing that a word $w$ is $\theta$-primitive if and only if $\{w, \theta(w)\}$
is a primitive set.

their error quadratically and matching, in many regimes, the optimal nonprivate

$G(n,m)$), node-private algorithms can be qualitatively more accurate than for

$\mathcal{L}$ has complete asynchrony, is leaderless, has no round robin, no
proof-of-work, and has eventual consensus.
  The core concept of our technology is the \emph{OPERA chain}, generated by
the Lachesis protocol. In the most general form, each node in Lachesis has a
set of $k$ neighbours of most preference. When receiving transactions a node
creates and shares an event block with all neighbours. Each event block is
signed by the hashes of the creating node and its $k$ peers. The OPERA chain of
the event blocks is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG); it guarantees practical
Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT). Our framework is then presented using Lamport
timestamps and concurrent common knowledge.
  Further, we present an example of Lachesis consensus protocol $L_0$ of our
framework. Our $L_0$ protocol can reach consensus upon 2/3 of all participants'
agreement to an event block without any additional communication overhead.
$L_0$ protocol relies on a cost function to identify $k$ peers and to generate
the DAG-based OPERA chain. By creating a binary flag table that stores
connection information and share information between blocks, Lachesis achieves
consensus in fewer steps than pBFT protocol for consensus.

gases. The spatial inhomogeneity of these systems imposes a redefinition of the
mean-field interparticle potential energy as compared to the homogeneous case.
In our approach, it takes the form $\frac{a}{2} N^2 \, \omega^d$, where $N$ is
the number of particles, $\omega$ - the harmonic trap frequency, $d$ - system's
dimensionality, and $a$ is a parameter characterizing the interparticle

case of a long-ranged interparticle potential of vanishingly small amplitude.
This conclusion is drawn from a computation similar to the well-known Kac
scaling procedure, which is presented here in a form adapted to the case of an
isotropic harmonic trap. We show that within our model, the imperfect gas of

$d>1$. The main result of our analysis is that in $d=1$ the gas of attractive
imperfect fermions with $a=-a_{F}<0$ is thermodynamically equivalent to the gas
of repulsive bosons with $a=a_{B}>0$ provided the parameters $a_{F}$ and
$a_{B}$ fulfill the relation $a_{B}+a_{F}=\hbar$. This result supplements
similar recent conclusion about thermodynamic equivalence of two-dimensional
uniform imperfect repulsive Bose and attractive Fermi gases.

two-dimensional Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD) and hybrid particle-in-cell
(HPIC) numerical simulations. We find that HMHD simulations exhibit spectral
properties that are in most cases in agreement with the results of the HPIC
simulations and with solar wind observations. The energy spectra of magnetic
fluctuations exhibit a double power-law with spectral index $-5/3$ at MHD
scales and $-3$ at kinetic scales, while for velocity fluctuations the spectral
index is $-3/2$ at MHD scales. The break between the MHD and the kinetic scales
occurs at the same scale in both simulations. In the MHD range the slopes of
the total energy and residual energy spectra satisfy a fast Alfv\'en-dynamo
balance. The development of a turbulent cascade is concurrently characterized
by magnetic reconnection events taking place in thin current sheets that form
between large eddies. A statistical analysis reveals that reconnection is
qualitatively the same and fast in both the HMHD and HPIC models, characterized
by inverse reconnection rates much smaller than the characteristic large-eddy
nonlinear time. The agreement extends to other statistical properties, such us
the kurtosis of the magnetic field. Moreover, the observation of a direct
energy transfer from the large vortices to the small sub-ion scales triggered
by magnetic reconnection, further supports the existence of a
reconnection-mediated turbulent regime at kinetic scales. We conclude that the
Hall-MHD fluid description captures to a large extent the transition of the
turbulent cascade between the large MHD scales and the sub-ion scales.

lensing are sensitive to the evolution of the matter power spectrum and the
expansion rate across cosmic time. Appropriately defined ratios of such

distances to the tracer objects and to the gravitational lensing source planes.
Because of their simple cosmological dependence, such ratios can exploit
available signal-to-noise down to small angular scales, even where directly
modeling the correlation functions is difficult. We present a measurement of
lensing ratios using galaxy position and lensing data from the Dark Energy
Survey, and CMB lensing data from the South Pole Telescope and Planck,
obtaining the highest precision lensing ratio measurements to date. Relative to
the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, we find a best fit lensing ratio amplitude
of $A = 1.1 \pm 0.1$. We use the ratio measurements to generate cosmological
constraints, focusing on the curvature parameter. We demonstrate that
photometrically selected galaxies can be used to measure lensing ratios, and
argue that future lensing ratio measurements with data from a combination of
LSST and Stage-4 CMB experiments can be used to place interesting cosmological
constraints, even after considering the systematic uncertainties associated
with photometric redshift and galaxy shear estimation.

particles, which radiate the received energy; how the dissipated power is
partitioned between particles needs further investigation with kinetic
simulations. We show that the dissipation regime switches from viscous to
collisionless during the jet expansion, at a critical value of the jet optical
depth which depends on the amplitude of turbulence. Turbulent GRB jets are
expected to emit nonthermal photospheric radiation. Our analysis also suggests
revisions of turbulent Comptonization in black hole accretion disks discussed
in previous works.

a broad ion beam at an oblique angle of incidence. Structurally, the linearized
operators associated with these fronts have unstable essential
spectrum---corresponding to instability of the spatially asymptotic

transition profile of the front. We show that these waves are linearly
orbitally asymptotically stable in appropriate exponentially weighted spaces.
While the technical device of exponential weights allows us to accommodate the
unstable essential spectrum of individual waves in our linear analysis, it does
not shed light on the long-time pattern formation that is observed
experimentally and in numerical simulations. To begin to address this issue, we
consider a periodic array of unstable front and back solutions. While not an
exact solution of the governing equation, this periodic pattern mimics
experimentally observed phenomena. Our numerical experiments suggest that the

rings and gaps develop naturally in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
disk-wind systems, especially in the presence of ambipolar diffusion (AD). Here
we extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and
gaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar
diffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was
identified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal
magnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of
a sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are
more strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the
less magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in
3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric
variations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an
extent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to
the end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner
edge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent
rings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise
be lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity
decreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by
the magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more
prominent in the disk.

idea, define an $\textit{fpc generator}$ to be any sequence of terms
$G_1,\dots,G_n$ such that \[ Y \in FPC \Rightarrow Y G_1 \cdots G_n \in FPC \]
In this contribution, we take first steps in studying the structure of (weak)

examining their elementary properties like injectivity and (weak) constancy. We
provide sufficient conditions for existence of fixed points of a given
generator $(G_1,\cdots,G_n)$: an fpc $Y$ such that $Y = Y G_1 \cdots G_n$. We
conjecture that weak constancy is a necessary condition for existence of such
(higher-order) fixed points. This statement generalizes Statman's conjecture on
non-existence of ""double fpcs"": fixed points of the generator $(G) = (\lambda
yx.x(yx))$ discovered by B\""ohm.
  Finally, we define and make a few observations about the monoid of (weak) fpc
generators. This enables us to formulate new a conjecture about their

spin-momentum-locked surface states, endows topological insulators with
superior spin-to-charge conversion characteristics, though the dynamics that
govern it have remained elusive. Here, we present an all-optical method that
enables unprecedented tracking of the ultrafast dynamics of spin-to-charge
conversion in a prototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$/ferromagnetic
Co heterostructure, down to the sub-picosecond timescale. Compared to pure
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or Co, we observe a giant terahertz emission in the
heterostructure than originates from spin-to-charge conversion, in which the
topological surface states play a crucial role. We identify a 0.12-picosecond
timescale that sets a technological speed limit of spin-to-charge conversion
processes in topological insulators. In addition, we show that the
spin-to-charge conversion efficiency is temperature independent in Bi$_2$Se$_3$
as expected from the nature of the surface states, paving the way for designing
next-generation high-speed opto-spintronic devices based on topological
insulators at room temperature.

that even small molecules can be used to stabilize ZnO surface and to enhance

convergence in the long run of the iterates to a stationary point under a
stability condition. The key ingredient is the introduction of a
continuous-time version of Adam, under the form of a non-autonomous ordinary
differential equation. This continuous-time system is a relevant approximation
of the Adam iterates, in the sense that the interpolated Adam process converges
weakly towards the solution to the ODE. The existence and the uniqueness of the

towards the critical points of the objective function and quantify its
convergence rate under a Lojasiewicz assumption. Then, we introduce a novel
decreasing stepsize version of Adam. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that
the iterates are almost surely bounded and converge almost surely to critical
points of the objective function. Finally, we analyze the fluctuations of the

machine learning, and artificial intelligence in general. A major focus in the
data stream literature is on designing methods that can deal with concept
drift, a challenge where the generating distribution changes over time. A
general assumption in most of this literature is that instances are
independently distributed in the stream. In this work we show that, in the
context of concept drift, this assumption is contradictory, and that the
presence of concept drift necessarily implies temporal dependence; and thus
some form of time series. This has important implications on model design and
deployment. We explore and highlight the these implications, and show that
Hoeffding-tree based ensembles, which are very popular for learning in streams,
are not naturally suited to learning \emph{within} drift; and can perform in
this scenario only at significant computational cost of destructive adaptation.
On the other hand, we develop and parameterize gradient-descent methods and
demonstrate how they can perform \emph{continuous} adaptation with no explicit
drift-detection mechanism, offering major advantages in terms of accuracy and
efficiency. As a consequence of our theoretical discussion and empirical
observations, we outline a number of recommendations for deploying methods in
concept-drifting streams.

that a different kind of evaluation is needed to assess how well models
translate inter-sentential phenomena such as pronouns. This paper therefore
presents a test suite of contrastive translations focused specifically on the

key-enabler technology for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications

communications for URLLC. In this regard, the overall packet loss probability
consists of transmission error probability and queueing-delay violation
probability. Queueing-delay has been modelled using the effective bandwidth.
Due to short transmission time, the infinite block-length has been replaced
with finite blocklength of the channel codes which rules out the application of
Shannon's formula. The achievable effective bandwidth of the system is derived,
and then, the transmission error probability has been analysed. The derivations
are validated through extensive simulations, which shows the variations of the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements of the system for various
transmission-error probability, QoS exponent, and the transmission packet size.

screening population. Chest CT scans made in lung cancer screening are suitable
for identification of participants at risk of CVD. Existing methods analyzing
CT images from lung cancer screening for prediction of CVD events or mortality
use engineered features extracted from the images combined with patient
information. In this work we propose a method that automatically predicts
5-year cardiovascular mortality directly from chest CT scans without the need
for hand-crafting image features. A set of 1,583 participants of the National
Lung Screening Trial was included (1,188 survivors, 395 non-survivors).
Low-dose chest CT images acquired at baseline were analyzed and the follow-up
time was 5 years. To limit the analysis to the heart region, the heart was
first localized by our previously developed algorithm for organ localization
exploiting convolutional neural networks. Thereafter, a convolutional
autoencoder was used to encode the identified heart region. Finally, based on
the extracted encodings subjects were classified into survivors or
non-survivors using a support vector machine classifier. The performance of the
method was assessed in eight cross-validation experiments with 1,433 images
used for training, 50 for validation and 100 for testing. The method achieved a
performance with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72. The results demonstrate
that prediction of cardiovascular mortality directly from low-dose screening
chest CT scans, without hand-crafted features, is feasible, allowing
identification of subjects at risk of fatal CVD events.

functions of the cosmological redshift from data on cosmic chronometers (CCH),
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and the Pantheon+MCT compilation of
supernovae of Type Ia (SnIa). The reconstruction is carried out with the
Weighted Function Regression method, previously introduced by G\'omez-Valent &
Amendola (2018). It improves the usual cosmographic approach by automatically
implementing Occam's razor criterion. This makes our procedure to be more free
of model and parametrization dependencies than many other analyses in the
literature. The reconstructed functions are fully compatible with the
predictions for the concordance model. In addition, we also discuss the
confidence level at which we can claim that the Universe (assumed to be flat,
homogeneous and isotropic) is currently accelerating. According to Jeffreys'
scale and jargon, we find moderate evidence in favor of such speed-up using the
data on SnIa+CCH, and very strong one when we also use data on BAOs. The
measured current value of the deceleration parameter in the latter case reads
$q_0\sim -0.60\pm 0.10$, and for the deceleration-acceleration transition
redshift we find $z_t\sim 0.8\pm 0.10$. The former is $\sim 6\sigma$ away from
$0$. This is in stark contrast, for instance, with the $\sim 17\sigma$ that are
found in the context of the flat $\Lambda$CDM even without including the BAOs
data. This indicates that cosmography and Occam's razor criterion play a
crucial role in this discussion, and that estimating the evidence for positive
acceleration only in the framework of a particular cosmological model or
parametrization is clearly insufficient.

proportional--in general--to $T_e^x - T_{ph}^x$, the exponent $x$ being
dependent on the effective dimensionality of the phonon gas distribution. If we
vary the temperature in a wide enough range, the effective dimensionality of
the phonon gas distribution changes going through a crossover around some
temperature, $T_C$. These changes are reflected by a change in $x$. On one
hand, in a temperature range well below a crossover temperature $T_C$ only the
lowest branches of the phonon modes are excited. They form a (quasi)
two-dimensional gas, with $x=3.5$. On the other hand, well above $T_C$, the
phonon gas distribution is quasi three-dimensional and one would expect to
recover the three dimensional results, with $x = 5$. But this is not the case
in our layered structure. The exponent $x$ has a complicated, non-monotonous
dependence on temperature forming a ""plateau region"" just after the crossover
temperature range, with $x$ between 4.5 and 5. After the plateau region, $x$
decreases, reaching values between 3.5 and 4 at the highest temperature used in
our numerical calculations, which is more than 40 times higher than $T_C$.

clustering model with uniformly weighted all pairwise-differences
regularization have been proved by Zhu et al. (2014) and Panahi et al. (2017).
However, no theoretical guarantee has been established for the general weighted
convex clustering model, where better empirical results have been observed. In
the numerical optimization aspect, although algorithms like the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the alternating minimization
algorithm (AMA) have been proposed to solve the convex clustering model (Chi

we develop a semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method for solving

robust for solving large-scale problems. Moreover, the numerical results also

this paper, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional spatial propagation
network (CSPN) to learn the affinity matrix for various depth estimation tasks.
Specifically, it is an efficient linear propagation model, in which the
propagation is performed with a manner of recurrent convolutional operation,
and the affinity among neighboring pixels is learned through a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). We can append this module to any output
from a state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation networks to improve their
performances. In practice, we further extend CSPN in two aspects: 1) take
sparse depth map as additional input, which is useful for the task of depth
completion; 2) similar to commonly used 3D convolution operation in CNNs, we
propose 3D CSPN to handle features with one additional dimension, which is
effective in the task of stereo matching using 3D cost volume. For the tasks of
sparse to dense, a.k.a depth completion. We experimented the proposed CPSN
conjunct algorithms over the popular NYU v2 and KITTI datasets, where we show
that our proposed algorithms not only produce high quality (e.g., 30% more
reduction in depth error), but also run faster (e.g., 2 to 5x faster) than
previous SOTA spatial propagation network. We also evaluated our stereo
matching algorithm on the Scene Flow and KITTI Stereo datasets, and rank 1st on
both the KITTI Stereo 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed module. The code of CSPN proposed in this work
will be released at https://github.com/XinJCheng/CSPN.

Next, for each corpus, we concatenate the 100 word vectors from beginning to

found that in the tree generated by clustering, the distance between the corpus

that we have discovered a specific language evolution tree. To verify the
stability and versatility of this method, we add three other themes: Dickens's
eight works, the 19th century poets' works, and art criticism of recent 60
years. For these four themes, we tested different parameters such as the time
span of the corpus, the time interval between the corpora, the dimension of the

that this is fairly stable and versatile.

The traditional panoramic products depend on post processing, which results in

on analyzing the GPU resources occupancy rate of each resolution image

utilization of GPU resources. Compared with the L-ORB algorithm, the efficiency
of this strategy is improved by 1.6-2.5 times, and it can make full use of GPU

poses important challenges arising from its intrinsic strong nonlinearity,
ill-posedness, and expensive computation costs. To tackle these difficulties,
we, for the first time to our best knowledge, exploit a connection between the

First, the parametric regression models are implemented to analyze the

the given polynomial is stable that is all its roots lie in the open left half
plane it is said to be Hurwitz polynomial and the corresponding vector is
called stable vector. The set of stable vectors is non-convex. In this paper,
we define special $(n+1) $ stable vectors such that their convex hull is

  Game Proposal",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article identifies a gap between the existence of a various psychometric
tests approaches and other team performance assessment tools (e.g. business and
management games). As a response to the lack of tools able to utilize the
knowledge about the behaviour patterns expressed in work environment and
descriptive business games, the article presents a game proposal. The mechanics
of the proposed game should allow for a quantifiable assessment of an
individual in the simulated project development environment, making it possible
to evaluate not only the team's performance, but the impact of actions of the
individual players and their interactions.

  Armband",,,,,"eess.SP cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main purpose of this research is to move the robotic arm (5DoF) in
real-time, based on the surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals, as obtained
from the wireless Myo gesture armband to distinguish seven hand movements. The
sEMG signals are biomedical signals that estimate and record the electrical
signals produced in muscles through their contraction and relaxation,
representing neuromuscular activities. Therefore, controlling the robotic arm
via the muscles of the human arm using sEMG signals is considered to be one of
the most significant methods. The wireless Myo gesture armband is used to
record sEMG signals from the forearm. In order to analyze these signals, the
pattern recognition system is employed, which consists of three main parts:
segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Overlap technique is
chosen for segmenting part of the signal. Six time domain features (MAV, WL,
RMS, AR, ZC, and SSC) are extracted from each segment. The classifiers (SVM,
LDA, and KNN) are employed to enable comparison between them in order to obtain
optimum accuracy of the system. The results show that the SVM achieves higher
system accuracy at 96.57 %, compared to LDA reaching 96.01 %, and 92.67 %
accuracy achieved by KNN.

models, we have shown that the new approach provides a better fit to the
supernovae Ia redshift data with a single parameter, the Hubble constant $H_0$,
than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with two parameters, $H_0$ and the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ related density $\Omega_{\Lambda}$. The new
approach is compliant with the cosmological principle. It yields the H_0=68.28
(+- 0.53) km s-1Mpc-1 with an analytical value of the deceleration parameter
q_0=-0.4. The analysis presented is for a matter only, flat universe. The
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ may thus be considered as a manifestation of a
non-adiabatic universe that is treated as an adiabatic universe.

Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$, $x$(Gd)$=0$, 0.01, 0.1, 0.78, 1 are determined in the
frequency range 30$-$35000$~cm^{-1}$. In all compounds, in addition to the
Drude free-carrier spectral component, a broad excitation is discovered with
the unusually large dielectric contribution $\Delta$$\varepsilon$=5000 -- 15000
and non-Lorentzian lineshape. It is suggested that the origin of the excitation
is connected with the dynamic cooperative Jahn-Teller effect of B$_6$ clusters.
Analysis of the spectra together with the results of DC and Hall resistivity
measurements shows that only 30$-$50$\%$ of the conduction band electrons are
contributing to the free carrier conductivity with the rest being involved in
the formation of an overdamped excitation, thus providing possible explanation
of remarkably low work function of thermoemission of Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ and
non-Fermi-liquid behavior in GdB$_6$ crystals.
