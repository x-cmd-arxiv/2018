which data at training time is severely biased. Since a neural network
efficiently learns data distribution, a network is likely to learn the bias
information to categorize input data. It leads to poor performance at test
time, if the bias is, in fact, irrelevant to the categorization. In this paper,
we formulate a regularization loss based on mutual information between feature
embedding and bias. Based on the idea of minimizing this mutual information, we
propose an iterative algorithm to unlearn the bias information. We employ an
additional network to predict the bias distribution and train the network
adversarially against the feature embedding network. At the end of learning,
the bias prediction network is not able to predict the bias not because it is
poorly trained, but because the feature embedding network successfully unlearns
the bias information. We also demonstrate quantitative and qualitative
experimental results which show that our algorithm effectively removes the bias
information from feature embedding.

models for the dynamics of money that have been introduced in the statistical
physics literature, focusing on two models with debts. Both models consist of
systems of economical agents located on a finite connected graph representing a
social network. Each agent is characterized by the number of coins she has,
which can be negative in case she is in debt, and each monetary transaction
consists in one coin moving from one agent to one of her neighbors. In the
first model, that we name the model with individual debt limit, the agents are
allowed to individually borrow up to a fixed number of coins. In the second
model, that we name the model with collective debt limit, agents can borrow
coins from a central bank as long as the bank is not empty, with reimbursements
occurring each time an agent in debt receives a coin. Based on numerical
simulations of the models on complete graphs, it was conjectured that, in the
large population/temperature limits, the distribution of money converges to a
shifted exponential distribution for the model with individual debt limit, and
to an asymmetric Laplace distribution for the model with collective debt limit.
In this paper, we prove exact formulas for the distribution of money that are
valid for all possible social networks. Taking the large population/temperature
limits in the formula found for the model with individual debt limit, we prove
convergence to the shifted exponential distribution, thus establishing the
first conjecture. Simplifying the formula found for the model with collective
debt limit is more complicated, but using a computer to plot this formula shows
an almost perfect fit with the Laplace distribution, which strongly supports
the second conjecture.

show that the system can be mapped to a non-Hermitian Kitaev model on a two-leg
ladder, which is solvable by representing the spins in terms of Majorana
fermions. This allows us to study the Liouvillian gap, the inverse of
relaxation time, in detail. We find that the Liouvillian gap increases
monotonically when the dissipation strength $ \gamma $ is small, while it
decreases monotonically for large $ \gamma $, implying a kind of phase
transition in the first decay mode. The Liouvillian gap and the transition

shown that the strength of the SF gets boosted because of the presence of
dynamical quarks in lieu of the current quarks. It increases as we increase the
magnetic field for a given value of temperature in both NJL and PNJL models.
This increment is further reflected in the DR which is enhanced as compared to
the Born rate for certain values of invariant masses. We also discuss the
impact of chemical potential on DR within the present scenario.

distinguish gluonium states from conventional hadrons. The valence two-gluon
contribution to a 0^+ gluonium bound state has L=0 and thus twist (dimension
minus spin of their minimum interpolating operators) tau=2. The competing twist
assignments for scalar f_0 mesons have twist tau = 3 for the valence |q qbar >

be suppressed by at least a power of momentum transfer. Distinguishing these

generically referred to as dissipative exchange flows (DEFs) because spatially
diffusing spin currents are established by the mutual exchange torque exerted
by neighboring spins. Analytical studies to date have been limited to the weak
spin injection assumption whereby the equation of motion for the magnetization
is mapped to hydrodynamic equations describing spin flow and then linearized.
Here, we analytically and numerically study easy-plane ferromagnetic channels
subject to spin injection of arbitrary strength at one extremum under a unified
hydrodynamic framework. We find that DEFs generally exhibit a nonlinear profile
along the channel accompanied by a nonlinear frequency tuneability. At large
injection strengths, we fully characterize a novel magnetization state we call
a contact-soliton DEF (CS-DEF) composed of a stationary soliton at the
injection site, which smoothly transitions into a DEF and exhibits a negative
frequency tuneability. The transition between a DEF and a CS-DEF occurs at the
maximum precessional frequency and coincides with the Landau criterion: a
subsonic to supersonic flow transition. Leveraging the hydraulic-electrical
analogy, the current-voltage characteristics of a nonlinear DEF circuit are
presented. Micromagnetic simulations of nanowires that include
magnetocrystalline anisotropy and non-local dipole fields are in qualitative
agreement with the analytical results. The magnetization states found here

accelerated at the Sun during periods of the solar activity. The generation
occurs in two steps. Initially, electron beams generate electrostatic Langmuir
waves and then these waves are transformed in electromagnetic emissions. It is
widely accepted that the mechanism of generation of emission on fundamental
frequency close to plasma frequency is due to induced scattering of Langmuir
waves into electromagnetic. However this process imposes quite restrictive
limit of the ratios of effective brightness temperatures of electromagnetic and
Langmuir waves in the source region. Recent studies showed that the level of
density fluctuations in the solar wind and in the solar corona is so high that
it may significantly affect beam-plasma interaction. Here we show that the
presence of intense density fluctuations not only crucially influence the
process of beam plasma interaction but also changes the mechanism of energy
transfer from electrostatic waves into electromagnetic. Reflection of the
Langmuir waves from the density inhomogeneities may result in partial
transformation of the energy of electrostatic wave into electromagnetic. We
show that the linear wave energy transformation for the level of fluctuations
of the order of 1\% or higher may be significantly more efficient for
generation of type III solar radio bursts than conventionally considered

approximating the resonators' internal structure. Despite the large system
size, we find a qualitative agreement between the simulations and experiments,
and characterize the microscopic origins of the observed disorder response. Our
microscopic description of macroscopic electrodynamics reveals how the response
of disordered arrays with strong field-mediated interactions is inherently
linked to their cooperative response to electromagnetic waves where the
multiple scattering induces strong correlations between the excitations of
individual resonators. Whereas for a regular array the response can be
overwhelmingly dominated by a spatially-extended collective eigenmode with
subradiant characteristics, a gradual increase of the positional disorder
rapidly leads to a spatial localization of both the electric and magnetic
dipolar excitation profile of this eigenmode. We show how the effects of
disorder and cooperative interactions are mapped onto the transmission
resonance in the far field spectrum and measure the ""cooperative Lamb shift"" of
the resonance that is shifting toward the red as the disorder increases. The
interplay between the disorder and interactions generally is most dramatic in
the microwave arrays, but we find that in suitable regimes the strong disorder
effects can be achieved also for plasmonic optical systems.

the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew informations have been recognized as valid
resource measures for the resource theory of asymmetry, and their properties
have been investigated from a resource-theoretic perspective. The
Wigner-Yanse-Dyson skew informations have been further generalized to a class

analyze this general family of the skew informations from an operational point

We show that such an approach allows for clear physical meanings as well as
simple proofs of some of the basic properties of the skew informations.
Notably, we constructively prove that any type of skew information cannot be
superadditive, where the violation of the superadditivity had been only known
for a specific class of skew informations with numerical counterexamples. We
further show a weaker version of superadditivity relation applicable to the
general class of the skew informations, which proves a conjecture made for the

$\mathbb{R}^d$. How many faces of dimension $\frac{d}{2}$ or higher can it
have? How dense can they be?
  This basic question goes back to Descartes' ""Lost Theorem"" and Euler's work
on polyhedra. Using it and other fundamental combinatorial problems, we
introduce a version of the K\""ahler package beyond positivity, allowing us to
prove the hard Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties (and beyond) even when the
ample cone is empty. A particular focus lies on replacing the Hodge-Riemann
relations by a non-degeneracy relation at torus-invariant subspaces, allowing
us to state and prove a generalization of theorems of Hall and Laman in the
setting of toric varieties and, more generally, the face rings of Hochster,
Reisner and Stanley. This has several applications:
  - We fully characterize the possible face numbers of simplicial rational
homology spheres, resolving the $g$-conjecture of McMullen in full generality
and generalizing Stanley's earlier proof for simplicial polytopes. The same
methods also verify a conjecture of K\""uhnel: if $M$ is a triangulated closed
$(d-1)$-manifold on $n$ vertices, then \[\binom{d+1}{j}\mathrm{b}_{j-1}(M)\ \le
\ \binom{n-d+j-2}{j}\ \quad \text{for}\ 1\le j\le \frac{d}{2}.\]
  - We prove that for a simplicial complex that embeds into $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$,
the number of $d$-dimensional simplices exceeds the number of
$(d-1)$-dimensional simplices by a factor of at most $d+2$. This generalizes a
result going back to Descartes and Euler, and resolves the
Gr\""unbaum-Kalai-Sarkaria conjecture. We obtain from this a generalization of
the celebrated crossing lemma: For a map of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ into
$\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, the number of pairwise intersections of $d$-simplices is at
least \[\frac{f_d^{d+2}(\Delta)}{(d+3)^{d+2}f_{d-1}^{d+1}(\Delta)}\] provided
$f_d(\Delta)> (d+3)f_{d-1}(\Delta)$.

approaching pure de Sitter at timelike infinity, enjoys an infinite dimensional
symmetry group at its horizon. This group is larger than the usual $SO(4,1)$ of
pure de Sitter. The charges associated with the asymptotic symmetry generators
are non-integrable, and we demonstrate that they promote an extended version of
the first law of thermodynamics. This contains four pairs of conjugate
variables. The pair $(\Theta,\Lambda)$ corresponding to the change in the
cosmological constant and its conjugate volume $\Theta$. The contribution of
the surface tension of the horizon and its conjugate parameter surface area
make a pair $(\sigma, A)$. The usual conjugate variables $ (T, S) $, $ (\Omega,
J) $ and a term $ \partial_v \delta S $ corresponding to entropy production,
are included. In addition, this extended first law describes the
non-conservative behaviour of the asymptotic charges in non-equilibrium.

scheme to compute an approximation of the multiplication of two massive
matrices. The objective is to reduce the recovery threshold, defined as the
total number of worker nodes that we need to wait for to be able to recover the
final result. To exploit the fact that only an approximated result is required,
in reducing the recovery threshold, some sorts of pre-compression are required.
However, compression inherently involves some randomness that would lose the
structure of the matrices. On the other hand, considering the structure of the
matrices is crucial to reduce the recovery threshold. In CodedSketch, we use
count--sketch, as a hash-based compression scheme, on the rows of the first and
columns of the second matrix, and a structured polynomial code on the columns
of the first and rows of the second matrix. This arrangement allows us to
exploit the gain of both in reducing the recovery threshold. To increase the
accuracy of computation, multiple independent count--sketches are needed. This
independency allows us to theoretically characterize the accuracy of the result
and establish the recovery threshold achieved by the proposed scheme. To
guarantee the independency of resulting count--sketches in the output, while
keeping its cost on the recovery threshold minimum, we use another layer of
structured codes.

10.5 kbar, 25 20 Ma. Both episodes of titanite growth are correlated with
specific CO2producing reactions and constrain the timing, duration and PT
conditions of the main CO2producing events, as well as the amounts of CO2
produced (1.4 1.8 wt percent of CO2). A firstorder extrapolation of such CO2
amounts to the orogen scale provides metamorphic CO2 fluxes ranging between 1.4

strategies, paying particular attention to cadence choices that are compatible
with the broader LSST cosmology programme. We find that if all kNe are
identical to GW170817, the baseline survey strategy will yield 58 kNe over the

kNe, we expect to detect only 27 kNe. However, we find the choice of survey
strategy significantly impacts these numbers and can increase them to 254 kNe
and 82 kNe over the survey lifetime, respectively. This improvement arises from
an increased cadence of observations between different filters with respect to
the baseline. We then consider the ability of the Advanced LIGO/Virgo (ALV)
detector network to detect these BNS mergers. If the optimal survey strategy is
adopted, 202 of the GW170817-like kNe and 56 of the BNS population model kNe

significant collisional losses, while starburst galaxies are CR proton

We also derive an equation relating the electric quadrupole moment of a sharply

longitudinal current which is linear in the electric field gradient, and which
depends on the quantum metric at the Fermi surface. We then give two examples

  Path Problem",,,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  All traditional methods of computing shortest paths depend upon
edge-relaxation where the cost of reaching a vertex from a source vertex is
possibly decreased if that edge is used. We introduce a method which maintains
lower bounds as well as upper bounds for reaching a vertex. This method enables
one to find the optimal cost for multiple vertices in one iteration and thereby
reduces the sequential bottleneck in Dijkstra's algorithm.
  We present four algorithms in this paper --- $SP_1$, $SP_2$, $SP_3$ and
$SP_4$. $SP_1$ and $SP_2$ reduce the number of heap operations in Dijkstra's
algorithm. For directed acyclic graphs, or directed unweighted graphs they have
the optimal complexity of $O(e)$ where $e$ is the number of edges in the graph
which is better than that of Dijkstra's algorithm. For general graphs, their
worst case complexity matches that of Dijkstra's algorithm for a sequential
implementation but allows for greater parallelism. Algorithms $SP_3$ and $SP_4$
allow for even more parallelism but with higher work complexity. Algorithm
$SP_3$ requires $O(n + e(\max(\log n, \Delta)))$ work where $n$ is the number
of vertices and $\Delta$ is the maximum in-degree of a node. Algorithm $SP_4$
has the most parallelism. It requires $O(ne)$ work. These algorithms generalize
the work by Crauser, Mehlhorn, Meyer, and Sanders on parallelizing Dijkstra's
algorithm.

curves of sub-Riemannian extremals [1,2] . Originally this construction was
done in [6,7], where it uses the specifics of Lagrangian Grassmannian. In later
works [3,4] a much more general theory for construction of canonical bundles of

discussed here can be considered as a particular case of this general theory.
Although this was briefly discussed at the very end of [3], the application of
the theory of [3,4] to obtain the results of [6,7] were never written in detail

conceptual point of view on the original results of [6,7] and especially
clarifies the origin of the normalization conditions of the canonical bundles

generated by a giant impact between the proto-Earth and an impactor
approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Since the impact was energetic, the disk
would have been hot and partially vaporized. This formation process is thought
to be responsible for the geochemical observation that the Moon is depleted in
volatiles. This model predicts that the Moon should be significantly depleted
in water as well, but this appears to contradict some of the recently measured
lunar water abundances and D/H ratios that suggest that the Moon is more
water-rich than previously thought. Alternatively, the Moon could have retained
its water if the upper of the disk were dominated by heavier species because
hydrogen would have had to diffuse out from the heavy-element rich disk, and
therefore the escape rate would have been limited by this slow diffusion
process (diffusion-limited escape). To identify which escape the disk would
have experienced and to quantify volatiles loss from the disk, we compute the
thermal structure of the Moon-forming disk considering various bulk water
abundances and mid-plane disk temperatures. Our calculations show that the
upper parts of the Moon-forming disk are dominated by heavy atoms or molecules
and hydrogen is a minor species. This indicates that hydrogen escape would have
been diffusion-limited, and therefore the amount of lost water and hydrogen
would have been small compared to the initial abundance assumed. This result
indicates that the giant impact hypothesis can be consistent with the
water-rich Moon. Furthermore, since the hydrogen wind would have been weak, the
other volatiles would not have escaped either. Thus, the observed volatile
depletion of the Moon requires another mechanism.

blockchain model, a chain is created by combining blocks of information. Each
node of network propagates the information based on its credibility to its peer
nodes. The credibility of a node will vary according to the respective

Local trust used for sharing information at the peer level and (ii) global
trust is used for a credibility check of each user in the network. We evaluate
our framework using real dataset derived from Facebook. Our approach achieves
an accuracy of 83% which shows the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

first non-toric Fano variety for which Bott vanishing has been shown, answering
a question by Achinger, Witaszek, and Zdanowicz.
  In another direction, we prove sharp results on which K3 surfaces satisfy
Bott vanishing. For example, a K3 surface with Picard number 1 satisfies Bott
vanishing if and only if the degree is 20 or at least 24. For K3 surfaces of
any Picard number, we have complete results when the degree is big enough. We

well as recent advances by Arbarello-Bruno-Sernesi, Ciliberto-Dedieu-Sernesi,

  The most novel aspect of the paper is our analysis of what happens when there
is an elliptic curve of low degree. (In other terminology, this concerns K3
surfaces that are unigonal, hyperelliptic, trigonal, or tetragonal.) It turns
out that the crucial issue is whether an elliptic fibration has a certain

  Germany",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The K-user discrete memoryless (DM) broadcast channel (BC) with two nested
multicast messages is studied in which one common message is to be multicast to
all receivers and the second private message to a subset of receivers. The
receivers that must decode both messages are referred to as private receivers
and the others that must decode only the common message as common receivers.
For two nested multicast messages, we establish the capacity region for several
classes of DM BCs characterized by the respective associated sets of pair-wise
relationships between and among the common and private receivers, each
described by the well-known more capable or less noisy conditions.
  For three classes of DM BCs, the capacity region is simply achieved by
superposition coding and the proofs of the converses rely on a recently found
information inequality. The achievable rate region is then enhanced through the
addition of a splitting of the private message into as many parts as there are
common receivers and indirect decoding. A closed-form two-dimensional
polyhedral description is obtained for it for a given coding distribution.
Through a converse result that relies on the well-known Csiszar sum lemma and
the information inequality, a specialization of this region that involves
splitting the private message into just two sub-messages is proved to be the
capacity region for several classes of DM BCs, beyond those for which
superposition coding alone is capacity optimal, thereby underscoring the
benefit of rate-splitting.
  All previously known capacity results for DM BCs with two nested multicast
messages for the two and three-receiver DM BCs as well as DM BCs with one
private or one common receiver are included in the general framework presented
in this work.

subdominant second field that decays much faster than the dominant one can
considerably enhance the temperature of the universe during an early

freeze-out/in and opens up the allowed parameter space toward significantly
larger dark matter masses. As a result, one can comfortably obtain the correct

One can treat these symmetries either like global symmetries that act on

interpretation can lead to an understanding of global, topology-dependent
features in systems with subsystem symmetries. We demonstrate this with an
exactly-solvable lattice model constructed from a 2D system of bosons coupled
to a vector field with a 1D subsystem symmetry. The model is shown to host a
robust ground state degeneracy that depends on the spatial topology of the
underlying manifold, and localized zero energy modes on corners of the system.
A continuum field theory description of these phenomena is derived in terms of
an anisotropic, modified version of the Abelian K-matrix Chern-Simons field

alternative. What makes the proposed setup more natural and closer to
human-like visual systems is threefold: First, we focus on concepts (or facts,
as we call them) of varying complexity, ranging from single objects to more
complex structures such as objects performing actions, and objects interacting
with other objects. Second, as in real-world settings, our setup has a
long-tail distribution, an aspect which has mostly been ignored in the LLL
context. Third, facts across tasks may share structure (e.g., <person, riding,
wave> and <dog, riding, wave>). Facts can also be semantically related (e.g.,
""liger"" relates to seen categories like ""tiger"" and ""lion""). Given the large
number of possible facts, a LLL setup seems a natural choice. To avoid model
size growing over time and to optimally exploit the semantic relations and
structure, we combine it with a visual semantic embedding instead of discrete
class labels. We adapt existing datasets with the properties mentioned above
into new benchmarks, by dividing them semantically or randomly into disjoint
tasks. This leads to two large-scale benchmarks with 906,232 images and 165,150
unique facts, on which we evaluate and analyze state-of-the-art LLL methods.

broadcast channel with two groupcast messages. The associated achievability
schemes are parameterized by an expansion of the message set which then
determines how random coding techniques are employed, which include generalized
versions of {\em up-set} message-splitting, the generation of possibly multiple
auxiliary codebooks for certain compositions of split messages using
superposition coding, partial interference decoding at all receivers, and joint
unique and non-unique decoding.
  New capacity results are established for certain partially ordered classes of
general broadcast channels for certain two non-nested messages. Moreover, when
specialized to the combination network (CN), some of the inner bounds are
shown, via converse results, to result in the capacity region for (a) the two
messages intended for two sets of K-1 receivers each and (b) two nested
messages in which one message is intended for one or (c) two (common)
receivers. In the latter two cases, we hence recover previous results by
Bidokhti et al obtained therein using network coding schemes based on
rate-splitting and linear superposition coding. Furthermore, we show the
achievability of rate pairs in two examples of CNs, with three and four common
receivers each, used in the previous literature to show the sub-optimality of
rate-splitting and linear superposition coding, and to motivate a pre-encoding
technique and a block-Markov linear superposition coding for the CN, with the
latter then lifted to the general broadcast channel. Our results suggest that
the proposed framework here, when specialized to the CN, is strong enough to
incorporate the enhancements afforded by those two latter techniques, thereby
suggesting among other things, that perhaps block-Markov superposition coding
is not necessary for the general broadcast channel.

different groups of runners that form during a race. In athletic races control
points are set to monitor the progress of athletes over the course.
Intuitively, a {\it group} is a sufficiently large set of athletes that cross a
control point together. After adapting an existing definition of group to our
setting we go on to study two types of group evolution patterns. The primary
focus of this work are {\it evolution patterns}, i.e. the transformation and
interaction of groups of athletes between two consecutive control points. We
provide an accurate geometric model of the following evolution patterns:
survives, appears, disappears, expands, shrinks, merges, splits, coheres and
disbands, and present algorithms to efficiently compute these patterns. Next,
based on the algorithms introduced for identifying evolution patterns,
algorithms to detect {\it long-term patterns} are introduced. These patterns
track global properties over several control points: surviving, traceable
forward, traceable backward and related forward and backward. Experimental
evaluation of the algorithms provided is presented using real and synthetic
data. Using the data currently available, our experiments show how our
algorithms can provide valuable insight into how running races develop.
Moreover, we also show how, even if dense (synthetic) data is considered, our
algorithms are also able to process it in real time.

spatio-angular dimensions of the visual signal. However, the popular way of
capturing light field (LF) via a plenoptic camera presents spatio-angular
resolution trade-off. Computational imaging techniques such as compressive
light field and programmable coded aperture reconstruct full sensor resolution
LF from coded projections obtained by multiplexing the incoming spatio-angular
light field. Here, we present a unified learning framework that can reconstruct
LF from a variety of multiplexing schemes with minimal number of coded images
as input. We consider three light field capture schemes: heterodyne capture
scheme with code placed near the sensor, coded aperture scheme with code at the
camera aperture and finally the dual exposure scheme of capturing a
focus-defocus pair where there is no explicit coding. Our algorithm consists of
three stages 1) we recover the all-in-focus image from the coded image 2) we
estimate the disparity maps for all the LF views from the coded image and the
all-in-focus image, 3) we then render the LF by warping the all-in-focus image
using disparity maps and refine it. For these three stages we propose three
deep neural networks - ViewNet, DispairtyNet and RefineNet. Our reconstructions
show that our learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results for all the
three multiplexing schemes. Especially, our LF reconstructions from
focus-defocus pair is comparable to other learning-based view synthesis
approaches from multiple images. Thus, our work paves the way for capturing
high-resolution LF (~ a megapixel) using conventional cameras such as DSLRs.

applications, such as restricted range of band gaps, propensity of ABX3 to
decompose into AX+BX2, or oxidation of 2ABX3 into A2BX6 have led to the need to
consider alloys of individual perovskites. This creates a non-trivial
material-selection problem, spanning a continuum of three sets of compositions
(one for each sub lattice), and requiring control of phase-separation or
ordering in each alloyed subfield. Not surprisingly, material and structure
choices were made thus far mostly via trial-and-error explorations. We use
ideas from solid state theory of semiconductor alloys to analyze the behaviors
of the (FA,Cs)(Pb,Sn)I3 alloys system. Density functional calculations
utilizing specially constructed supercells (SQS) are used to calculate the
composition dependence of band gaps, energy of decomposition and alloy mixing
enthalpies. A number of trends are observed for A-site as well as for B-site
alloys. To understand the physical reasons that control these trends we
decompose the alloy properties into distinct physical terms: (i) the energies
associated with removing the octahedral deformations (tilting, rotations, B
site displacements), (ii) the energies of compressing the larger component and
expanding the smaller one to the alloy volume, (iii) the charge transfer
energies associated with placing the alloyed units onto a common lattice, and
finally, (iv) structural relaxation of all bonds within the cells., This
analysis clarifies the origin of the observed trends in bang gaps,
decomposition energies and mixing enthalpies. Unlike a number of previous
calculations we find that the a proper description of alloy physics requires
that even the pure, non-alloyed end-point compounds be allowed to develop local
environment dependent octahedral deformation that lowers significantly the

sparsity across various regions in the image. In order to face this challenge,
the $\ell_{0,\infty}$ ""norm"" has been proposed as an alternative that ""operates
locally while thinking globally"". The approaches taken for tackling the
non-convexity of these optimization problems have been either using a convex
relaxation or local pursuit algorithms. In this paper, we present an efficient
greedy method for sparse coding and dictionary learning, which is specifically
tailored to $\ell_{0,\infty}$, and is based on matching pursuit. We demonstrate
the usage of our approach in salt-and-pepper noise removal and image

a new skeleton-based representation for 3D action recognition in videos. The
key idea of the proposed representation is to transform 3D joint coordinates of
the human body carried in skeleton sequences into RGB images via a color
encoding process. By normalizing the 3D joint coordinates and dividing each
skeleton frame into five parts, where the joints are concatenated according to
the order of their physical connections, the color-coded representation is able
to represent spatio-temporal evolutions of complex 3D motions, independently of
the length of each sequence. We then design and train different Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs) based on the Residual Network

motion features and classify them into classes. Our method is evaluated on two
widely used action recognition benchmarks: MSR Action3D and NTU-RGB+D, a very

the value and end the game, or discard the value permanently and continue the

Instead, it builds an internal model of the underlying data, which can be
refined significantly faster (e.g., only 1.9 milliseconds for 300 queries).
This fast refinement allows QuickSel to continuously learn from each query and
yield increasingly more accurate selectivity estimates over time. Unlike
query-driven histograms, QuickSel relies on a mixture model and a new
optimization algorithm for training its model. Our extensive experiments on two
real-world datasets confirm that, given the same target accuracy, QuickSel is
34.0x-179.4x faster than state-of-the-art query-driven histograms, including
ISOMER and STHoles. Further, given the same space budget, QuickSel is
26.8%-91.8% more accurate than periodically-updated histograms and samples,
respectively.

estimation algorithm is prone to causative attacks. Causative attacks, in
principle, target decision-making algorithms to alter their decisions by making
them oblivious to specific attacks. Such attacks influence inference algorithms
by tampering with the mechanism through which the algorithm is provided with
the statistical model of the population about which an inferential decision is
made. Causative attacks are viable, for instance, by contaminating the
historical or training data, or by compromising an expert who provides the
model. In the presence of causative attacks, the inference algorithms operate
under a distorted statistical model for the population from which they collect
data samples. This paper introduces specific notions of secure estimation and
provides a framework under which secure estimation under causative attacks can
be formulated. A central premise underlying the secure estimation framework is
that forming secure estimates introduces a new dimension to the estimation
objective, which pertains to detecting attacks and isolating the true model.
Since detection and isolation decisions are imperfect, their inclusion induces
an inherent coupling between the desired secure estimation objective and the
auxiliary detection and isolation decisions that need to be formed in
conjunction with the estimates. This paper establishes the fundamental
interplay among the decisions involved and characterizes the general decision
rules in closed-form for any desired estimation cost function. Furthermore, to
circumvent the computational complexity associated with growing parameter
dimension or attack complexity, a scalable estimation algorithm and its
attendant optimality guarantees are provided. The theory developed is applied
to secure parameter estimation in a sensor network.

the nonlocal dipole field arising from the finite thickness of magnetic thin

it is found that the nonlocal dipole field modulates the fluid velocity. Such a
modulation induces a magnonic band structure unlike the typical dispersion
relation for magnons on uniform magnetization. The analytical results are

the low-dimensional lattices ($d$=1,2) with finite interaction range. The model
consists of four types of subpopulations with different opinions: $A, B, AB$,
and the zealot of $A$ denoted by $A_c$, following the basic model shown in the
work by S. A. Marvel et al.. Comparing with their work, we consider the finite
range of the interaction, and particularly reconstruct the lattice structure by
adding new links when the two individuals have the distance $<\sigma$. We
explore how the interaction range $\sigma$ affects the opinion consensus
process on the reconstructed lattice structure. We find that the critical
fraction of population for $A_c$ required for the opinion consensus on $A$
shows different behaviors in the small and large interaction ranges.
Especially, the critical fraction for $A_c$ increases with the size of $\sigma$
in the region of small interaction range, which is counter-intuitive: When the
interaction range is increased, not only the number of nodes affected by $A_c$

model for manifold diagrams called singular n-cubes. In the second part we
apply this model to build our notions of higher categories.
  Singular n-cubes are ""directed triangulations"" of space together with a
decomposition into a collection of subspaces or strata. Singular n-cubes can be
naturally organised into two categories. The first, whose morphisms are bundles
themselves, is used for the inductive definition of singular (n+1)-cubes. The
second, whose morphisms are ""open"" base changes, admits an (epi,mono)
factorisation system. Monomorphisms will be called embeddings of cubes.
Epimorphisms will be called collapses and describe how triangulations can be
coarsened. Each cube has a unique coarsest triangulation called its normal
form. The existence of normal forms makes the equality relation of
(combinatorially represented) manifold diagrams decidable.
  As the main application of the resulting combinatorial framework for manifold
diagrams, we give algebraic definitions of various notions of higher
categories. Namely, we define associative n-categories, presented associative
n-categories and presented associative n-groupoids. All three notions will have
strict units and associators; the only weak coherences are homotopies, but we
develop a mechanism for recovering the usual coherence data of weak
n-categories, such as associators and pentagonators and their higher analogues.
This will motivate the conjecture that the theory of associative higher

systems. A robust domain of attraction is a set of states such that every
trajectory starting from it will approach an equilibrium while never violating
a specified state constraint, regardless of the actual perturbation. The
semi-definite program is constructed by relaxing a generalized Zubov's
equation. The existence of solutions to the constructed semi-definite program
is guaranteed and there exists a sequence of solutions such that their strict
one sub-level sets inner-approximate the interior of the maximal robust domain
of attraction in measure under appropriate assumptions. Some illustrative
examples demonstrate the performance of our method.

These methods, however, are not robust to changes in the collection of
surfaces, or do not produce accurate registrations at a resolution high enough
for subsequent downstream analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for
efficiently registering such collections given initial correspondences with
varying degrees of accuracy. By combining the initial information with recent
developments in manifold learning, we employ a simple metric condition to
construct a measure on the space of correspondences between any pair of shapes
in our collection, which we then use to distill soft correspondences. We
demonstrate that this measure can improve correspondence accuracy between
feature points compared to currently employed, less robust methods on a diverse
dataset of surfaces from evolutionary biology. We then show how our methods can
be used, in combination with recent sampling and interpolation methods, to
compute accurate and consistent homeomorphisms between surfaces.

of $\beta=2$ is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable. The
Bernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic)
behavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space
$\{0,1\}^{\omega}$. The beta transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the
unit interval, it singles out a subspace of the Cantor space, in such a way
that it is invariant under the action of the left-shift operator. That is,
lopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace. The beta transform
seems to capture something basic about the multiplication of two real numbers:
$\beta$ and $x$. It offers a window into understanding the nature of
multiplication. Iterating on multiplication, one would get $\beta^{n}x$ - that
is, exponentiation; although the mod 1 of the beta transform contorts this in
interesting ways. The work presented here is a research diary: a pastiche of
observations and some shallow insights. One is that chaos seems to be rooted in
how the carry bit behaves during multiplication. Another is that one can
surgically insert ""islands of stability"" into chaotic (ergodic) systems, and
have some fair amount of control over how those islands of stability behave. In
particular, one can have islands with, or without a period-doubling ""route to
chaos"". The eigenvalues of the transfer operator seem to lie on a circle of
radius $1/\beta$ in the complex plane. Given that the transfer operator is
purely real, the appearance of such a quasi-unitary spectrum seems surprising.
The spectrum appears to be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic
polynomials, the positive real roots of which include the Golden and silver
ratios, the Pisot numbers, the n-bonnaci (tribonacci, tetranacci, etc.)
numbers.

this work, we will apply Bayesian shrinkage to model high dimensional parameter

shrinkage prior, e.g., $t$ prior, on the differences of successive parameter
entries, and such a fusion prior will shrink successive differences towards
zero and hence induce posterior blocking. Comparing to conventional Bayesian
fused lasso which implements Laplace fusion prior, $t$ fusion prior induces
stronger shrinkage effect and enjoys a nice posterior consistency property.
Simulation studies and real data analyses show that $t$ fusion has superior
performance to the frequentist fusion estimator and Bayesian Laplace-fusion

better posterior distributional convergence than the classical Dirichlet

the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness. Subtle distinction among
different grades and existence of many significant small features make the task
of recognition very challenging. In addition, the present approach of
retinopathy detection is a very laborious and time-intensive task, which
heavily relies on the skill of a physician. Automated detection of diabetic
retinopathy is essential to tackle these problems. Early-stage detection of
diabetic retinopathy is also very important for diagnosis, which can prevent
blindness with proper treatment. In this paper, we developed a novel deep
convolutional neural network, which performs the early-stage detection by
identifying all microaneurysms (MAs), the first signs of DR, along with
correctly assigning labels to retinal fundus images which are graded into five
categories. We have tested our network on the largest publicly available Kaggle
diabetic retinopathy dataset, and achieved 0.851 quadratic weighted kappa score
and 0.844 AUC score, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
severity grading. In the early-stage detection, we have achieved a sensitivity
of 98% and specificity of above 94%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed method. Our proposed architecture is at the same time very simple

Currently, three generations of EGFR kinase-targeted small molecule drugs have

treatment results in acquired drug resistance and further vulnerability to
NSCLC. Therefore, novel EGFR kinase inhibitors that specially overcome acquired

strategy. Our analysis shows that both wild-type and mutated structures exhibit
multiple conformational states that have not been observed in solved crystal

the standing of journals, disciplines, and the entire biomedical literature

Bhattacharya telescope (JCBT). During the first run, we were able to observe 17
blazars in the Bessel $R$ filter for $\sim$137 hrs. Using $C$ and scaled
$F$-statistics, we quantify the extent of INOV and derive the duty cycle (DC)
which is the fraction of time during which a source exhibits a substantial flux
variability. We find a high DC of 40\% for BL Lac objects and the flat spectrum
radio quasars are relatively less variable (DC $\sim15$\%). However, when
estimated for blazars sub-classes, a high DC of $\sim$59\% is found in low
synchrotron peaked (LSP) blazars, whereas, intermediate and high synchrotron
peaked objects have a low DC of $\sim$11\% and 13\%, respectively. We find
evidences about the association of the high amplitude INOV with the
$\gamma$-ray flaring state. We also notice a high polarization during the
elevated INOV states (for the sources that have polarimetric data available),
thus supporting the jet based origin of the observed variability. We plan to
enlarge the sample and utilize the time availability from the small telescopes,

SIR spreading process, is still unclear. To fill this gap, a, which is
extracted from the fitting function (f(x)=1-1/(e^(2a(x-b))+1)) of the average
number of nodes in each radius of the neighborhood of a node, is proposed.
Experiment results which are carried out on twenty real-world networks show
that a can classify which of the three measures (degree, h-index and coreness)
is more proper to a network in ranking node importance. We also find that [b/3]
is a good indicator for forecasting the optimal radius of the neighborhood of a

Furthermore, by extending the range of neighborhood where we construct an

a node. The ranking accuracies of most networks can be improved when the radius
is increased from 0 to its forecasting optimal radius and the improvement, for
the best case, reaches up to 111%. The performances will reduce on half of the

calculated volatility. As the prices of the stocks goes high due to
overpricing, volatility increases at a tremendous rate and when volatility
becomes very high market tends to fall, which can be observed and determined

process dynamics and the costs associated with every control strategy. The
problem becomes much harder if the controller only knows a finite set of
possible running cost functions, but has no way of checking which of these
running costs is actually in place. In this paper we address this challenge for
a class of evasive path planning problems on a continuous domain, in which an
Evader needs to reach a target while minimizing his exposure to an enemy
Observer, who is in turn selecting from a finite set of known surveillance
plans. Our key assumption is that both the evader and the observer need to
commit to their (possibly probabilistic) strategies in advance and cannot
immediately change their actions based on any newly discovered information
about the opponent's current position. We consider two types of evader
behavior: in the first one, a completely risk-averse evader seeks a trajectory
minimizing his {\em worst-case} cumulative observability, and in the second,
the evader is concerned with minimizing the {\em average-case} cumulative
observability. The latter version is naturally interpreted as a semi-infinite
strategic game, and we provide an efficient method for approximating its Nash
equilibrium. The proposed approach draws on methods from game theory, convex
optimization, optimal control, and multiobjective dynamic programming. We
illustrate our algorithm using numerical examples and discuss the computational
complexity, including for the generalized version with multiple evaders.

impact on training time.
  To tackle the problem, we design a new distributed training system called
Stanza. Stanza exploits the fact that in many models such as convolution neural
networks, most data exchange is attributed to the fully connected layers, while
most computation is carried out in convolutional layers. Thus, we propose layer
separation in distributed training: the majority of the nodes just train the
convolutional layers, and the rest train the fully connected layers only.
Gradients and parameters of the fully connected layers no longer need to be
exchanged across the cluster, thereby substantially reducing the data transfer
volume. We implement Stanza on PyTorch and evaluate its performance on Azure
and EC2. Results show that Stanza accelerates training significantly over

connected components of a graph. There is no doubt that this kind of node which

ensuring the connectivity. However, we should not thus neglect the impacts of
non-APs nodes. In this paper, we define a local AP (LAP) whose removal will

Through investigating the fraction of LAPs in forty-five real networks, we find
a critical proportion s_cr, which is equal to 0.5 (s=r/D, D is the diameter of
a network), and this result can also be turned out in ER networks. In addition,
we present a unique advantage of LAPs in dismantling networks under the process

strong dependence on the doped hole content, p, within the copper oxide
plane(s). The doping dependent Jc mainly exhibits the variation of the
intrinsic depairing critical current density as p is varied. Jc(p) tends to
peak at p ~ 0.185 in copper oxide superconductors. This particular value of the
hole content, often termed as the critical hole concentration, has several
features putative to a quantum critical point (QCP). Very recently, pressure
dependences of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and the critical
current (Ic) in pure CeRhIn5 and Sn doped CeRhIn5 heavy fermion compounds have
been reported (Nature Communications (2018) 9:44, DOI:
10.1038/s41467-018-02899-5). The critical pressure demarcates an
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point where both Tc and Ic are maximized. We
have compared and contrasted this behavior with those found for
Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-d in this brief communication. The resemblance of the
systematic behavior of the critical current with pressure and hole content
between heavy fermion systems and hole doped cuprates is significant. This adds

Universe at high redshifts. With the increasing precision of ongoing CMB
surveys, other statistics than the lensing power spectrum, in particular the
lensing bi-spectrum, will be measured at high statistical significance. This
will provide ways to improve the constraints on cosmological models and lift
degeneracies. Following on an earlier paper, we test analytical predictions of
the CMB lensing bi-spectrum against full-sky lensing simulations, and discuss
their validity and limitation in detail. The tree-level prediction of
perturbation theory agrees with the simulation only up to $\ell\sim 200$, but
the one-loop order allows capturing the simulation results up to $\ell\sim
600$. We also show that analytical predictions based on fitting formulas for
the matter bi-spectrum agree reasonably well with simulation results, although
the precision of the agreement depends on the configurations and scales
considered. For instance, the agreement is at the $10\%$-level for the
equilateral configuration at multipoles up to $\ell\sim2000$, but the
difference in the squeezed limit raises to more than a factor of two at
$\ell\sim2000$. This discrepancy appears to come from limitations in the
fitting formula of the matter bi-spectrum. We also find that the analytical

provides a degree of tunability by external means. In this work, a magnetically
tunable multi-band NFRHT is revealed in a system of two suspended graphene
sheets at room temperature. It is found that the single-band spectra for B=0
split into multi-band spectra under an external magnetic field. Dual-band
spectra can be realized for a modest magnetic field (e.g., B=4 T). One band is
determined by intra-band transitions in the classical regime, which undergoes a
blue shift as the chemical potential increases. Meanwhile, the other band is
contributed by inter-Landau-level transitions in the quantum regime, which is
robust against the change of chemical potentials. For a strong magnetic field
(e.g., B=15 T), there is an additional band with the resonant peak appearing at
near-zero frequency (microwave regime), stemming from the magneto-plasmon zero
modes. The great enhancement of NFRHT at such low frequency has not been found

disorder are awful outcomes of the maternal alcohol consumption linked with
notable cognitive and behavioral defects. Alcohol consumed by the pregnant
mother, being teratogenic, interferes with the fetal health resulting brain
damage and other birth defects. This might affect the brain cells at the very
nanolevel which cannot be predicted by the present histopathological
procedures. We perform quantification of nanoscale spatial structural
alterations in two different spatial molecular components, DNA and histone
molecular mass densities, in brain cell nuclei of fetal alcohol effected (FAE)
pups at postnatal day 60. Confocal images of the brain cells are collected and
the degree of morphological alterations in DNA and histone, in terms of mass
density fluctuations are obtained using the recently developed molecular
specific light or photonic localization analysis technique. The results show an
increase in degree of spatial structural disorder in DNA and a reduced histone
modification. Increase in spatial disorder in DNA may suggest DNA unwinding and
possibly responsible for increase in gene expression. Reduced histone
modification may suggest its release from the DNA and help in the unwinding of
DNA and gene expression. The probable cause for structural disorder as well as
opposite rearrangements for DNA and histone molecules in fetal alcohol effects
is also discussed.

new types of MR have been observed in much simpler bilayers consisting of

gate voltage. These results are explained by the penetration of the InAs

that MS/SGB/RGB stars of a given luminosity are not of the same mass but fall

the probabilities of finding the universe or the particle in a given point of

interaction strengths of hydrophilic and hydrophobic attraction and
electrostatic interactions between a lipid molecule and an NP. A neutral NP
passes through the lipid membrane when the hydrophobic interaction is
sufficiently strong. As the valence of the positively charged NP increases, the
membrane permeation speed of the NP is increased compared with the neutral NP
and charged lipids are accumulated around the charged NP. A charged NP with a
high valence passes through the lipid membrane via a transient channel formed
by charged lipids or transport-like endocytosis. These permeation processes can
be classified based on analyses of the density correlation function. When the
non-electrostatic interaction parameters are large enough, a negatively charged
NP can be adsorbed on the membrane and a neutral lipid-rich region is formed
directly below the NP. The NP is spontaneously incorporated into the vesicle
under various conditions and the incorporation is mediated by the membrane
curvature. We reveal how the NP's behavior depends on the NP valence, size, and
the non-electrostatic interaction parameters.

Dilatometry together with Scanning Electron Microscopy combined with Electron
Backscatter Diffraction analyses and thermodynamic simulations provide insight
into the austenite formation mechanisms that operate at different heating
rates. Two main mechanisms of austenite formation during re-austenitization
were identified: diffusional and diffusionless (massive). At conventional (1-5
{\deg}C/s) and fast (10-50 {\deg}C/s) heating rates the austenite formation
mechanism and kinetics are controlled by diffusion, whereas at ultrafast
heating rates (100-500 {\deg}C/s) the formation of austenite starts by
diffusion control, but is later overtaken by a massive transformation
mechanism. Comprehensive thermodynamic descriptions of the influence of
cementite on austenite formation are discussed. The finest austenite grain size
and the highest final hardness are achieved with a lower bainite starting

Noether's theorem and Belinfante SET which can be obtained as a right-hand side
of the Einstein's equation in the flat metric limit. This question is studied
in the wide class of Poincar\`e-invariant field theories with actions which
depend on the tensor fields of arbitrary rank and their derivatives of
arbitrary order. For this class we derive the relation between these SET and
present the exact expression for the difference between them. We also show that
the difference between corresponding integrals of motion can be expressed as a
surface integral over 2-dimensinal infinitely remote surface.

defined with a lattice cut-off. The model can be viewed as defined with a
proper time but with no reference to any three-dimensional spatial background
geometry. It has four phases, depending on the parameters (the coupling
constants) of the model. The particularly interesting behavior is observed in
the so-called de Sitter phase, where the spatial three-volume distribution as a
function of proper time has a semi-classical behavior which can be obtained
from an effective mini-superspace action. In the case of the three-sphere
spatial topology, it has been difficult to extend the effective semi-classical
description in terms of proper time and spatial three-volume to include genuine
spatial coordinates, partially because of the background independence inherent
in the model. However, if the spatial topology is that of a three-torus, it is
possible to define a number of new observables that might serve as spatial
coordinates as well as new observables related to the winding numbers of the
three-dimensional torus. The present paper outlines how to define the
observables, and how they can be used in numerical simulations of the model.

complex eigenvalue ({\lambda}_ci) of the velocity gradient tensor (if exist) is
the pseudo-time average angular velocity of a trajectory moving circularly or
spirally around the axis. In addition, an explicit expression of the Liutex

obtained for the first time from above understanding, which can further, though
mildly, accelerate the calculation and give more physical comprehension of the

of three-dimensional solids, which follow relativistic energy-momentum relation
$\epsilon_\mathbf{k}= \hbar v_F |\mathbf{k}|$ at low energies. Such a linear
dispersion when regularized on a lattice can lead to remarkable properties such
as the anomalous Hall effect, presence of Fermi surface arcs, positive
longitudinal magnetoconductance, and dynamic chiral magnetic effect. The last
two properties arise due to the manifestation of chiral anomaly in these
semimetals, which refers to the non-conservation of chiral charge in the
presence of electromagnetic gauge fields. Here, we propose the planar Nernst
effect, or transverse thermopower, as another consequence of chiral anomaly,
which should occur in both Dirac and Weyl semimetals. We analytically calculate
the planar Nernst coefficient for DSMs (type-I and type-II) and also WSMs
(type-I and type-II), using a quasi-classical Boltzmann formalism. The planar
Nernst effect manifests in a configuration when the applied temperature
gradient, magnetic field, and the measured voltage are all co-planar, and is of
distinct origin when compared to the anomalous and conventional Nernst effects.
Our findings, specifically a 3D map of the planar Nernst coefficient in type-I
Dirac semimetals (Na$_3$Bi, Cd$_3$As$_2$ etc) and type-II DSM (PdTe$_2$, VAI3
etc), can be verified experimentally by an in-situ 3D double-axis rotation
extracting the full $4\pi$ solid angular dependence of the Nernst coefficient.

in sliding 0.5-2 s windows, using fine-binned light curves in 2-60 keV energy
range. The significance of the oscillation candidates was assessed by
simulations which took into account light curve variations, dead time and
sliding time windows. Some of our sources exhibited multi-frequency variability
below approximately 15 Hz that cannot be readily removed with light-curve
modeling and may have an astrophysical (non-TBO) nature. Overall, we found that
the number and strength of potential candidates depends strongly on the
parameters of the search. We found candidates from all previously known RXTE
TBO sources, with pulsations that had been detected at similar frequencies in
multiple independent time windows, and discovered TBOs from SAX J1810.8-2658.
We could not confirm most previously-reported tentative TBO detections or
identify any obvious candidates just below the detection threshold at similar
frequencies in multiple bursts. We computed fractional amplitudes of all TBO
candidates and placed upper limits on non-detections. Finally, for a few
sources we noted small excess of candidates with powers comparable to fainter
TBOs, but appearing in single independent time bins at random frequencies. At
least some of these candidates may be noise spikes that appear interesting due
to selection effects. The potential presence of such candidates calls for extra
caution if claiming single-bin TBO detections.

observations resemble the training data. However, real-world robotic systems
must react intelligently to their observations even in unexpected
circumstances. This requires a system to reason about its own uncertainty given
unfamiliar, out-of-distribution observations. Approximate Bayesian approaches
are commonly used to estimate uncertainty for neural network predictions, but
can struggle with out-of-distribution observations. Generative models can in
principle detect out-of-distribution observations as those with a low estimated
density. However, the mere presence of an out-of-distribution input does not by
itself indicate an unsafe situation. In this paper, we present a method for
uncertainty-aware robotic perception that combines generative modeling and
model uncertainty to cope with uncertainty stemming from out-of-distribution
states. Our method estimates an uncertainty measure about the model's
prediction, taking into account an explicit (generative) model of the
observation distribution to handle out-of-distribution inputs. This is
accomplished by probabilistically projecting observations onto the training
distribution, such that out-of-distribution inputs map to uncertain
in-distribution observations, which in turn produce uncertain task-related
predictions, but only if task-relevant parts of the image change. We evaluate
our method on an action-conditioned collision prediction task with both
simulated and real data, and demonstrate that our method of projecting
out-of-distribution observations improves the performance of four standard
Bayesian and non-Bayesian neural network approaches, offering more favorable
trade-offs between the proportion of time a robot can remain autonomous and the
proportion of impending crashes successfully avoided.

image quality assessment (IQA) method based on image entropy. The image
features are extracted from two domains. In the spatial domain, the mutual
information between the color channels and the two-dimensional entropy are
calculated. In the frequency domain, the two-dimensional entropy and the mutual
information of the filtered sub-band images are computed as the feature set of
the input color image. Then, with all the extracted features, the support
vector classifier (SVC) for distortion classification and support vector
regression (SVR) are utilized for the quality prediction, to obtain the final
quality assessment score. The proposed method, which we call entropy-based
no-reference image quality assessment (ENIQA), can assess the quality of
different categories of distorted images, and has a low complexity. The
proposed ENIQA method was assessed on the LIVE and TID2013 databases and showed
a superior performance. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed
ENIQA method has a high consistency of objective and subjective assessment on
color images, which indicates the good overall performance and generalization
ability of ENIQA. The source code is available on github

be measured with a 35\% uncertainty using $\mathcal{L}=300\,\mbox{fb}^{-1}$ of

properties of the Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals (MW dSphs). We show that instead
of resulting from large amounts of dark matter (DM), the large velocity
dispersions observed along their lines of sight can be entirely accounted for
by dynamical heating of DM-free systems resulting from MW tidal shocks. Such a
regime is expected if the progenitors of the MW dwarfs are infalling
gas-dominated galaxies. In this case, gas lost through ram-pressure leads to a
strong decrease of self-gravity, a phase during which stars can radially
expand, while leaving a gas-free dSph in which tidal shocks can easily develop.
  The DM content of dSphs is widely derived from the measurement of the dSphs
self-gravity acceleration projected along the line of sight. We show that the
latter strongly anti-correlates with the dSph distance from the MW, and that it
is matched in amplitude by the acceleration caused by MW tidal shocks on
DM-free dSphs. If correct, this implies that the MW dSphs would have negligible
DM content, putting in question, e.g., their use as targets for DM direct
searches, or our understanding of the Local Group mass assembly history. Most
of the progenitors of the MW dSphs are likely extremely tiny dIrrs, and deeper
observations and more accurate modeling are necessary to infer their properties
as well as to derive star formation histories of the faintest dSphs.

several unique features in the proposed architecture that tightly link with the

identified and a new Z-window function is proposed. The architecture exploits
the concept of synthetic synapses to enable potential synapses in the HTM. The
crossbar for the SP avoids dark spots caused by unutilized crossbar regions and
supports rapid on-chip training within 2 clock cycles. This research also
leverages plasticity mechanisms such as neurogenesis and homeostatic intrinsic
plasticity to strengthen the robustness and performance of the SP. The proposed
design is benchmarked for image recognition tasks using MNIST and Yale faces

in a two-dimensional (2D) electron system in a magnetic field. In three
dimensions (3D), the QHE is forbidden because the third dimension spreads
Landau levels into multiple overlapping bands, destroying the quantisation.
Here we report the QHE in graphite crystals that are up to hundreds of atomic
layers thick - thickness at which graphite was believed to behave as a 3D bulk
semimetal. We attribute the observation to a dimensional reduction of electron
dynamics in high magnetic fields, such that the electron spectrum remains
continuous only in the direction of the magnetic field, and only the last two
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Landau bands cross the Fermi level. In sufficiently
thin graphite films, the formation of standing waves breaks these 1D bands into
a discrete spectrum, giving rise to a multitude of quantum Hall plateaux.
Despite a large number of layers, we observe a profound difference between
films with even and odd numbers of graphene layers. For odd numbers, the
absence of inversion symmetry causes valley polarisation of the standing-wave
states within 1D Landau bands. This reduces QHE gaps, as compared to films of
similar thicknesses but with even layer numbers because the latter retain the
inversion symmetry characteristic of bilayer graphene. High-quality graphite
films present a novel QHE system with a parity-controlled valley polarisation
and intricate interplay between orbital, spin and valley states, and clear
signatures of electron-electron interactions including the fractional QHE below
0.5 K.

of the ASE source being mixed (thermal), and hence inferior compared to the

bandwidth of the ASE source results in achieving a substantially superior

transition-metal dichalcogenides and their strong light-matter interaction have
attracted unrivalled attention by the research community due to their
extraordinarily large oscillator strength as well as binding energy, and the
inherent spin-valley locking. Semiconducting few-layer and monolayer materials
with their sharp optical resonances such as WSe2 have been extensively studied
and envisioned for applications in the weak as well as strong light-matter
coupling regimes, for effective nano-laser operation with various different
structures, and particularly for valleytronic nanophotonics motivated by the
circular dichroism. Many of these applications, which may benefit heavily from
the two-dimensional electronic quasiparticle's properties in such films,
require controlling, manipulating and first of all understanding the nature of
the optical resonances that are attributed to exciton modes. While theory and
previous experiments have provided unique methods to the characterization and
classification efforts regarding the band structure and optical modes in 2D
materials, here, we directly measure the quasiparticle energy-momentum
dispersion for the first time. Our results for single-layer WSe2 clearly
indicate an emission regime predominantly governed by free excitons, i.e.
Coulomb-bound electron-hole pairs with centre-of-mass momentum and
corresponding effective mass. Besides uniquely evidencing the existence of free
excitons at cryogenic temperatures optically, the fading of the dispersive
character for increased temperatures or excitation densities reveals a
transition to a regime with profound role of charge-carrier plasma or localized
excitons regarding its emission, debunking the myth of free-exciton emission at
elevated temperatures.

representation, utilizing the indexing of System-calls to a set of groups of
similar functionality, constructing thus an abstract and mutation-tolerant
graph that we call Group Relation Graph (GrG); then, we construct another graph
representation, which we call Coverage Graph (CvG), that depicts the dominating
relations between the nodes of a GrG graph. Based on the research so far in the
field, we pointed out that behavior-based graph representations had not
leveraged the aspect of the temporal evolution of the graph. Hence, the novelty
of our work is that, preserving the initial representations of GrG and CvG
graphs, we focus on augmenting the potentials of theses graphs by adding
further features that enhance its abilities on detecting and further
classifying to a known malware family an unknown malware sample. To that end,
we construct periodical instances of the graph that represent its temporal
evolution concerning its structural modifications, creating another graph
representation that we call Temporal Graphs. In this paper, we present the
theoretical background behind our approach, discuss the current technological
status on malware detection and classification and demonstrate the overall
architecture of our proposed detection and classification model alongside with
its underlying main principles and its structural key-components.

property is commonly called the Hahn property and it is an extension of the
concept of classical polynomials to the context of multiple orthogonality. The
emphasis is on the polynomials whose indices lie on the step line, also known
as $2$-orthogonal polynomials. We explain the relation of the asymptotic
behavior of the recurrence coefficients to that of the largest zero (in
absolute value) of the polynomial set. We provide a full characterization of
the Hahn-classical orthogonality measures supported on a $3$-star in the

essentially three distinct families, one of them $2$-orthogonal with respect to
two confluent functions of the second kind. This paper complements earlier

Africa, where atmospheric data is usually very scarce, there is a minimal
attempt at finding a statistical model for T_m, as a function of T_s. In this
work, attempt has been made to find such a model using data from the Climate

obtained using radiosonde data with root-mean-square error of 1.189 and

intelligent services. Although the computation capability of the vehicle is
limited, multi-type of edge computing nodes provide heterogeneous resources for
vehicular services.When offloading the complicated service to the vehicular
edge computing node, the decision should consider numerous factors.The
offloading decision work mostly formulate the decision to a resource scheduling
problem with single or multiple objective function and some constraints, and
explore customized heuristics algorithms. However, offloading multiple data
dependency tasks in a service is a difficult decision, as an optimal solution
must understand the resource requirement, the access network, the user
mobility, and importantly the data dependency. Inspired by recent advances in
machine learning, we propose a knowledge driven (KD) service offloading
decision framework for Vehicle of Internet, which provides the optimal policy
directly from the environment. We formulate the offloading decision of
multi-task in a service as a long-term planning problem, and explores the
recent deep reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal solution. It considers
the future data dependency of the following tasks when making decision for a
current task from the learned offloading knowledge. Moreover, the framework
supports the pre-training at the powerful edge computing node and continually
online learning when the vehicular service is executed, so that it can adapt
the environment changes and learns policy that are sensible in hindsight. The
simulation results show that KD service offloading decision converges quickly,
adapts to different conditions, and outperforms the greedy offloading decision
algorithm.

computer science recent hardware and software advances, particularly in areas
as robotics, AI-hardware, self-adaptive systems, IoT, CPS, etc. At the
modelling, conceptual level, our main contribution is the introduction of the
concept of ""virtual organism"" (VO), to populate the intermediary level between
rigid, slightly reconfigurable, hardware agents and abstract, intelligent,
adaptive software agents. A virtual organism has a structure, resembling the
hardware capabilities, and it runs low-level functions, implementing the
software requirements. The model is compositional in space (allowing the
virtual organisms to aggregate into larger organisms) and in time (allowing the
virtual organisms to get composed functionalities). Technically, the virtual
organisms studied here are in 2D and their structures are described by regular
2D pattens; adding the time dimension, we conclude the VO model is in 3D. By
reconfiguration, an organism may change its structure to another structure
belonging to the same 2D pattern. We illustrate the VO concept with three
increasingly more complex VOs: (1) a tree collector; (2) a feeding cell; and
(3) a collection of connected feeding cells. We implemented a simulator for
tree collector organisms and the quantitative results show reconfigurable
structures are better suited than fixed structures in dynamically changing
environments. We briefly show how Agapia - a structured parallel, interactive
programming language where dataflow and control flow structures can be freely
mixed - may be used for getting quick implementations for VO's simulation.

of human activity, including the construction and production of building

processes, scientific research. In particular, one of the methods for
extracting highly viscous bitumen grades of oil from the subterranean depths is
based on the dilution of the contents of the porous medium by means of pumping
coolants. The simplest and environmentally friendly coolant is wet steam
containing small drops of water. In addition, with the help of heated water
vapour, the filtering elements of collectors are cleaned from sediments of the
solid phase (for example, paraffins, gas hydrates and ice floes) on the walls
of the porous medium. For realistic modeling of the processes of filtration and
heat and mass transfer during the injection of wet steam into a porous medium,
it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of the interaction of
saturated water vapour with individual through-type pores. In this paper, a
study was carried out through mathematical modelling of the dependence of the
diffusion rate of wet water vapour on the pressure difference outside the pore
that occurs when water vapour is injected into a porous medium. The
dependencies of the diffusion rate on the pore cross section, the magnitude of
vapour adsorption on the pore walls, as well as the effect of water vapour
temperature on all these processes were also investigated. Practical interest
is the study of the influence of the rate of cooling of water vapour on the
diffusion rate and the adsorption of water vapour on the wall of the pores. The
calculations were carried out using a hybrid type model that combines molecular
dynamics and macro-diffusion approaches to describe the interaction of water
vapour with individual pores.

define the sensitivity of parameters with respect to the measurement errors, a
mechanics-based distance between two sets of parameters is introduced. Using
this distance function, we assess the reliability of certain parameter
identification procedures. The assessment involves introduction of artificial
noise to the experimental data; the noise can be both correlated and
uncorrelated. An analytical procedure to speed up Monte Carlo simulations is
presented. As a result, a simple tool for estimating the robustness of
parameter identification is obtained. The efficiency of the approach is
illustrated using a model of finite-strain elasto-plasticity, which accounts
for combined isotropic and kinematic hardening. It is shown that dealing with
correlated measurement errors, most stable identification results are obtained
for non-diagonal weighting matrix. At the same time, there is a conflict
