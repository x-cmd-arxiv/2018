  Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recent trend in object oriented (OO) programming languages is the use of
Access Permissions (APs) as an abstraction for controlling concurrent
executions of programs. The use of AP source code annotations defines a
protocol specifying how object references can access the mutable state of
objects. Although the use of APs simplifies the task of writing concurrent
code, an unsystematic use of them can lead to subtle problems. This paper
presents a declarative interpretation of APs as Linear Concurrent Constraint
Programs (lcc). We represent APs as constraints (i.e., formulas in logic) in an
underlying constraint system whose entailment relation models the
transformation rules of APs. Moreover, we use processes in lcc to model the
dependencies imposed by APs, thus allowing the faithful representation of their
flow in the program. We verify relevant properties about AP programs by taking
advantage of the interpretation of lcc processes as formulas in Girard's
intuitionistic linear logic (ILL). Properties include deadlock detection,
program correctness (whether programs adhere to their AP specifications or
not), and the ability of methods to run concurrently. By relying on a focusing
discipline for ILL, we provide a complexity measure for proofs of the above
mentioned properties. The effectiveness of our verification techniques is
demonstrated by implementing the Alcove tool that includes an animator and a
verifier. The former executes the lcc model, observing the flow of APs and
quickly finding inconsistencies of the APs vis-a-vis the implementation. The
latter is an automatic theorem prover based on ILL. This paper is under
consideration for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming
(TPLP).

key-value stores used as caches. Our goal is to dynamically scale resources to
the traffic pattern minimizing the overall cost, which includes not only the
storage cost, but also the cost due to misses. In fact, a small variation on
the cache miss ratio may have a significant impact on user perceived
performance in modern web services, which in turn has an impact on the overall
revenues for the content provider that uses those services. We propose and
study a dynamic algorithm for TTL caches, which is able to obtain
close-to-minimal costs. Since high-throughput caches require low complexity
operations, we discuss a practical implementation of such a scheme requiring
constant overhead per request independently from the cache size. We evaluate
our solution with real-world traces collected from Akamai, and show that we are
able to obtain a 17% decrease in the overall cost compared to a baseline static

artificial intelligence. They are most typically solved by tree search
algorithms that simulate ahead into the future, evaluate future states, and
back-up those evaluations to the root of a search tree. Among these algorithms,
Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most general, powerful and widely

to the particular characteristics of the domain. These rules control where the
simulation traverses, what to evaluate in the states that are reached, and how
to back-up those evaluations. In this paper we instead learn where, what and
how to search. Our architecture, which we call an MCTSnet, incorporates
simulation-based search inside a neural network, by expanding, evaluating and
backing-up a vector embedding. The parameters of the network are trained
end-to-end using gradient-based optimisation. When applied to small searches in
the well known planning problem Sokoban, the learned search algorithm

current research in planetary science. Whereas asteroid observations are
currently unable to pinpoint the source regions of most meteorite classes,
observations of meteors with camera networks and the subsequent recovery of the
meteorite may help make progress on this question. The main caveat of such an
approach, however, is that the recovery rate of meteorite falls is low,
implying that the meteoritic analogues of at least 80% of the observed falls
remain unknown.
  Aims: Spectroscopic observations of bolides may have the potential to
mitigate this problem by classifying the incoming material.
  Methods: To probe the use of spectroscopy to determine the meteoritic
analogues of bolides, we collected emission spectra in the visible range
(320-880nm) of five meteorite types (H,L,LL,CM,eucrite) acquired in atmospheric
entry-like conditions in a plasma wind tunnel at the University of Stuttgart
(Germany). A detailed spectral analysis including line identification and mass
ratio determinations (Mg/Fe,Na/Fe) was subsequently performed on all spectra.
  Results: Spectroscopy, via a simple line identification, allows us to
distinguish the main meteorite classes (chondrites, achondrites and irons) but
does not have the potential to distinguish for example an H from a CM
chondrite.
  Conclusions: The source location within the main belt of the different
meteorite classes (H, L, LL, CM, etc.) should continue to be investigated via
fireball observation networks. Spectroscopy of incoming bolides only marginally
helps precisely classify the incoming material (iron meteorites only). To reach
a statistically significant sample of recovered meteorites along with accurate
orbits (>100) within a reasonable time frame (10-20 years), the optimal
solution may be the spatial extension of existing fireball observation
networks.

intrinsic randomness. In particular, for a specific Bell experiment, one can
derive relations between the amount of randomness produced, as quantified by
the min-entropy of the output data, and its associated violation of a Bell
inequality. In practice, due to finite sampling, certifying randomness requires
the development of statistical tools to lower-bound the min-entropy of the data
as a function of the estimated Bell violation. The quality of such bounds
relies on the choice of certificate, i.e., the Bell inequality whose violation
is estimated. In this work, we propose a method for choosing efficiently such a
certificate. It requires sacrificing a part of the output data in order to
estimate the underlying correlations. Regularising this estimate then allows
one to find a Bell inequality that is well suited for certifying practical
randomness from these specific correlations. We then study the effects of
various parameters on the obtained min-entropy bound and explain how to tune
them in a favourable way. Lastly, we carry out several numerical simulations of
a Bell experiment to show the efficiency of our method: we nearly always obtain
higher min-entropy rates than when we use a pre-established Bell inequality,

and run in time that grows as $n\cdot k$, which can be prohibitive for large
domain size $k$.
  We propose Hadamard Response (HR}, a local privatization scheme that requires
no shared randomness and is symmetric with respect to the users. Our scheme has

most $\log k+2$ bits per user, and nearly linear running time of $\tilde{O}(n +

solely on the effects linear in magnetization ($\bm{M}$). Nevertheless, a

(QMOKE) can additionally contribute to experimental data. Handling and
understanding the underlying origin of QMOKE could be the key to utilize this
effect for investigation of antiferromagnetic materials in the future due to
their vanishing first order MOKE contribution. Also, better understanding of
QMOKE and hence better understanding of magnetooptic (MO) effects in general is
very valuable, as the MO effect is very much employed in research of ferro- and
ferrimagnetic materials. Therefore, we present our QMOKE and longitudinal MOKE
spectroscopy setup with a spectral range of 0.8--5.5\,eV. The setup is based on
light modulation through a photoelastic modulator and detection of
second-harmonic intensity by a lock-in amplifier. To measure the Kerr
ellipticity an achromatic compensator is used within the setup, whereas without
it Kerr rotation is measured. The separation of QMOKE spectra directly from the
measured data is based on measurements with multiple magnetization directions.
So far the QMOKE separation algorithm is developed and tested for but not
limited to cubic (001) oriented samples. The QMOKE spectra yielded by our setup
arise from two quadratic MO parameters $G_s$ and $2G_{44}$, being elements of
quadratic MO tensor $\bm{G}$, which describe perturbation of the permittivity
tensor in the second order in $\bm{M}$.

accepted that energetic protons can be accelerated by shocks, whether or not
these shocks can also efficiently accelerate solar energetic electrons is still
debated. In this study we present observations of the extremely widespread SEP
event of 26 Dec 2013. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the widest
longitudinal SEP distribution ever observed together with unusually
long-lasting energetic electron anisotropies at all observer positions. Further
striking features of the event are long-lasting SEP intensity increases, two
distinct SEP components with the second component mainly consisting of
high-energy particles, a complex associated coronal activity including a
pronounced signature of a shock in radio type-II observations, and the
interaction of two CMEs early in the event. The observations require a
prolonged injection scenario not only for protons but also for electrons. We
therefore analyze the data comprehensively to characterize the possible role of
the shock for the electron event. Remote-sensing observations of the complex
solar activity are combined with in-situ measurements of the particle event. We
also apply a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the coronagraph
observations of the two associated CMEs to analyze their interaction. We find
that the shock alone is likely not responsible for this extremely wide SEP
event. Therefore we propose a scenario of trapped energetic particles inside
the CME-CME interaction region which undergo further acceleration due to the
shock propagating through this region, stochastic acceleration, or ongoing
reconnection processes inside the interaction region. The origin of the second
component of the SEP event is likely caused by a sudden opening of the particle
trap.

we have developed a GAN-based approach toward image demosacing in which a
discriminator network with both perceptual and adversarial loss functions are
used for quality assurance; 2) we propose to optimize the perceptual quality of
reconstructed images by the proposed GAN in an end-to-end manner. Such
end-to-end optimization of GAN is particularly effective for jointly exploiting
the gain brought by each modular component (e.g., residue learning in the
generative network and perceptual loss in the discriminator network). Our
extensive experimental results have shown convincingly improved performance
over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective and

sterile neutrino decays inside a detector at fixed target experiment are
suppressed by the mixing angle to the power of four. Therefore sensitivity of
experiments such as SHiP and DUNE should take into account minimal possible
values of the mixing angles. We extend the previous study of this subject
arXiv:1312.2887 to a more general case of non-zero CP-violating phases in the
neutrino sector. Namely, we provide numerical estimate of minimal value of
mixing angles between active neutrinos and two sterile neutrinos with the third
sterile neutrino playing no noticeable role in the mixing. Thus we obtain a
sensitivity needed to fully explore the seesaw type I mechanism for sterile
neutrinos with masses below 2 GeV, and one undetectable sterile neutrino that
is relevant for the fixed-target experiments. Remarkably, we observe a strong
dependence of this result on the lightest active neutrino mass and the neutrino
mass hierarchy, not only on the values of CP-violating phases themselves. All
these effects sum up to push the limit of experimental confirmation of
sterile-active neutrino mixing by several orders of magnitude below the results

approximation schemes for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear pathwise
stochastic partial differential equations, and for proving their convergence.
Our results apply to approximations such as explicit finite difference schemes
and Trotter-Kato type mixing formulas. The irregular time dependence disrupts
the usual methods from the classical viscosity theory for creating schemes that
are both monotone and convergent, an obstacle that cannot be overcome by
incorporating higher order correction terms, as is done for numerical
approximations of stochastic or rough ordinary differential equations. The
novelty here is to regularize those driving paths with non-trivial quadratic
variation in order to guarantee both monotonicity and convergence.
  We present qualitative and quantitative results, the former covering a wide
variety of schemes for second-order equations. An error estimate is established
in the Hamilton-Jacobi case, its merit being that it depends on the path only
through the modulus of continuity, and not on the derivatives or total
variation. As a result, it is possible to choose a regularization of the path
so as to obtain efficient rates of convergence. This is demonstrated in the
specific setting of equations with multiplicative white noise in time, in which
case the convergence holds with probability one. We also present an example
using scaled random walks that exhibits convergence in distribution.

core component, well-characterized uncertainty estimates must accompany
predictions. However, S&E observations and model-simulations often follow
heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since
they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent
developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture
uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model
parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Here we present a
discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for
uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ
estimates on `DeepSD', a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical
Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an
extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models
outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and
uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution,
which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates
at the extremes. Such results may be important across S&E, as well as other
domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant
interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where
both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized.

only the breaking of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mu\tau}$ with two relevant breaking
parameters ($\epsilon_{4,6}^\prime$), after a comprehensive numerical analysis,
we show that the phenomenologically viable case in this scenario is a special
case of TM1 mixing. For this class of models, from the phenomenological
perspective, one always needs large breaking (more than $ 45\%$) in one of the
breaking parameters. However, to be consistent the maximal mixing of
$\theta_{23}$, while more than $ 35\%$ breaking is needed in the other, a range
$49.4^\circ-53^\circ$ and $38^\circ-40^\circ$ could be probed allowing breaking
up to $ 25\%$ in the same parameter. Thus though this model cannot distinguish
the octant of $\theta_{23}$, non-maximal mixing is preferred from the viewpoint
of small breaking. The model is also interesting from leptogenesis perspective.
Unlike the standard $N_1$-leptogenesis scenario, here all the RH neutrinos
contribute to lepton asymmetry due to the small mass splitting controlled by
the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mu\tau}$ breaking parameters. Inclusion of flavour coupling
effects (In general, which have been partially included in all the leptogenesis
studies in perturbed TBM framework) makes our analysis and results pertaining
to a successful leptogenesis more accurate than any other studies in existing

lengths of the dump a positron beam can continuously scan for resonant
production of new resonances via $e^+$ annihilation off an atomic $e^-$ in the

previously used to model the 2PCF of optically selected quasars and X-ray

a single HOD parameterization can be used to model the population of different
kinds of AGN in dark matter halos suggesting the universality of the
relationship between AGN and their host dark matter halos. Our results show
that the median halo mass of central quasar hosts increases from optically
selected ($4.1^{+0.3}_{-0.4} \times 10^{12} \; h^{-1} \; {M_{sun}}$) and
infra-red (IR) bright unobscured populations ($6.3^{+6.2}_{-2.3} \times 10^{12}

clustering. The projected satellite fractions also increase from optically
bright to obscured quasars and tend to disfavor a simple `orientation only'
theory of active galactic nuclei unification. Our results also show that future
measurements of the small-scale clustering of obscured quasars can constrain
current theories of galaxy evolution where quasars evolve from an IR- bright

dynamical system, PCN can be unfolded to a feedforward model that becomes
deeper and deeper over time, while refining it representation towards more

order to eliminate duplicate transmission through the backhaul can reduce the
latency of data delivery in $5$G networks. However, since caching can only
reduce the backhaul delay, techniques such as base station densification will
also need to be used to reduce the fronthaul delay. In this paper, using
results from stochastic geometry, we first model the effects of base station
densification and cache size on the latency of the system. We then derive a
tight approximation for the cache hit probability. To optimize the network cost
due to the deployment of base station (BS) and cache storage, a minimization
problem for the product of the BS intensity and cache size is formulated under
probabilistic delay constraint, which is converted into a geometric program and
solved analytically. The results are then used to analyze the economics of a
cache-enabled virtualized cellular network where the network infrastructure,
i.e., BSs and cache storage, owned by an infrastructure provider (InP) is
shared among multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). For the pricing between
the InP and the MNOs, we formulate a Stackelberg game with the InP as the
leader and multiple MNOs as the followers. In this virtualized scenario, the
common cost of renting the infrastructure is shared in a fair manner among the
MNOs by using the Shapely value. An efficient algorithm is provided to divide
the rent among MNOs.

fluorescence, since an optical target detecting these antibunched photons will
either be spectrally broad itself and not benefit from the spectrally narrow

will be spoiled. We first explain this failure through a decomposition of the
field-emission and how this gets affected by frequency resolution. We then show
how to restore the sought joint subnatural linewidth and antibunched
properties, by interfering the resonance fluorescence output with a coherent
beam. We finally discuss how the signal that is eventually generated in this
way features a new type of quantum correlations, with a plateau of antibunching
which suppresses much more strongly close photon pairs. This introduces a new

and provided unique discoveries. In 1999, CDA detected interstellar dust in the
inner solar system followed by the detection of electrical charges of
interplanetary dust grains during the cruise phase between Earth and Jupiter.
The instrument determined the composition of interplanetary dust and the
nanometre sized dust streams originating from Jupiter's moon Io. During the
approach to Saturn in 2004, similar streams of submicron grains with speeds in
the order of 100 km/s were detected from Saturn's inner and outer ring system
and are released to the interplanetary magnetic field. Since 2004 CDA measured
more than one million dust impacts characterizing the dust environment of
Saturn. The instrument is one of three experiments which discovered the active
ice geysers located at the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus in 2005.
Later, a detailed compositional analysis of the water ice grains in Saturn's E
ring system lead to the discovery of large reservoirs of liquid water (oceans)
below the icy crust of Enceladus. Finally, the determination of the dust-
magnetosphere interaction and the discovery of the extended E ring (at least
twice as large as predicted) allowed the definition of a dynamical dust model
of Saturn's E ring describing the observed properties. This paper summarizes
the discoveries of a ten year story of success based on reliable measurements
with the most advanced dust detector flown in space until today. This paper
focuses on cruise results and findings achieved at Saturn with a focus on flux

reach the observation altitude. They are wide field of view (FoV) detectors
able to view the whole sky simultaneously and continuously. In fact, EAS arrays
have an effective FoV of about 2 sr and operate with a duty cycle of
$\sim$100\%. This capability makes them well suited to study extended sources,
such as the Galactic diffuse emission and measure the spectra of Galactic
sources at the highest energies (near or beyond 100 TeV). Their sensitivity in
the sub-TeV/TeV energy domain cannot compete with that of Cherenkov telescopes,
but the wide FoV is ideal to perform unbiased sky surveys, discover transients
or explosive events (GRBs) and monitor variable or flaring sources such as
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). An EAS array is able to detect at the same time
events induced by photons and charged cosmic rays, thus studying the connection
between these two messengers of the non-thermal Universe. Therefore, these
detectors are, by definition, multi-messenger instruments.
  Wide FoV telescopes are crucial for a multi-messenger study of the
Gravitational Wave events due to their capability to survey simultaneously all
the large sky regions identified by LIGO and VIRGO, looking for a possible
correlated $\gamma$-ray emission.
  In this contribution we summarize the scientific motivations which push the
construction of new wide FoV air shower detectors and introduce the future
instruments currently under installation. Finally, we emphasize the need of an
EAS array in the Southern hemisphere to monitor the Inner Galaxy and face a
number of important open problems.

unstable dimensions for all of its periodic orbits and we can say such
attractors exhibit ""mono-chaos"". In high-dimensional chaotic attractors,
trajectories are prone to travel through quite different regions of phase
space, some far more unstable than others. This heterogeneity makes
predictability even more difficult than in low-dimensional homogeneous chaotic
attractors. A chaotic attractor is ""multi-chaotic"" if every point of the
attractor is arbitrarily close to periodic points with different numbers of
unstable dimensions. We believe that most physical systems possessing a
high-dimensional attractor are of this type. We make three conjectures about
multi-chaos which we explore using three two-dimensional paradigmatic examples
of multi-chaotic attractors. They can be thought of as small-scale examples
that give insight for real high-dimensional phenomena. We find a single route
from mono-chaos to multi-chaos if an attractor changes continuously as a
parameter is varied. This multi-chaos bifurcation (MCB) is a periodic orbit
bifurcation; one branch of periodic orbits is created with a number of unstable
dimensions that is different from the mono-chaos.

paper, we ask: Can we build a global exchange where everyone can contribute
computation and data to train the next generation of machine learning
applications?
  We present an early, but running prototype of DataBright, a system that turns
the creation of training examples and the sharing of computation into an
investment mechanism. Unlike most crowdsourcing platforms, where the
contributor gets paid when they submit their data, DataBright pays dividends
whenever a contributor's data or hardware is used by someone to train a machine
learning model. The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they
created. To enable the measurement of usage, a computation platform that
contributors can trust is also necessary. DataBright thus merges both a data
market and a trusted computation market.
  We illustrate that trusted computation can enable the creation of an AI
market, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid to its
creator. DataBright allows data creators to retain ownership of their
contribution and attaches to it a measurable value. The value of the data is
given by its utility in subsequent distributed computation done on the
DataBright computation market. The computation market allocates tasks and
subsequent payments to pooled hardware. This leads to the creation of a
decentralized AI cloud. Our experiments show that trusted hardware such as
Intel SGX can be added to the usual ML pipeline with no additional costs. We
use this setting to orchestrate distributed computation that enables the
creation of a computation market. DataBright is available for download at

$J_B^{(2)}$. Rather, 2-group symmetries are characterized by deformed current
algebras, with quantized structure constants, which allow two flavor currents

identities, which constrain the allowed patterns of spontaneous 2-group
symmetry breaking and other aspects of the renormalization group flow. If
$J_B^{(2)}$ is coupled to a 2-form background gauge field $B^{(2)}$, the
2-group current algebra modifies the behavior of $B^{(2)}$ under background
gauge transformations. Its transformation rule takes the same form as in the
Green-Schwarz mechanism, but only involves the background gauge or gravity
fields that couple to the other 2-group currents. This makes it possible to
partially cancel reducible 't Hooft anomalies using Green-Schwarz counterterms
for the 2-group background gauge fields. The parts that cannot be cancelled are
reinterpreted as mixed, global anomalies involving $U(1)_B^{(1)}$ and receive
contributions from topological, as well as massless, degrees of freedom.
Theories with 2-group symmetry are constructed by gauging an abelian flavor
symmetry with suitable mixed 't Hooft anomalies, which leads to many simple and
explicit examples. Some of them have dynamical string excitations that carry
$U(1)_B^{(1)}$ charge, and 2-group symmetry determines certain 't Hooft
anomalies on the world sheets of these strings. Finally, we point out that
holographic theories with 2-group global symmetries have a bulk description in

properties of stellar-mass black holes and hence a testbed for general
relativity. One explanation for these features is that relativistic distortion
of the accretion disc's differential rotation creates a trapping region in
which inertial waves (r-modes) might grow to observable amplitudes. Local
analyses, however, predict that large-scale magnetic fields push this trapping
region to the inner disc edge, where conditions may be unfavorable for r-mode
growth. We revisit this problem from a pseudo-Newtonian but fully global
perspective, deriving linearized equations describing a relativistic,
magnetized accretion flow, and calculating normal modes with and without
vertical density stratification. In an unstratified model, the choice of
vertical wavenumber determines the extent to which vertical magnetic fields
drive the r-modes toward the inner edge. In a global model fully incorporating
density stratification, we confirm that this susceptibility to magnetic fields
depends on disc thickness. Our calculations suggest that in thin discs, r-modes
may remain independent of the inner disc edge for vertical magnetic fields with
plasma betas as low as $\beta\approx 100-300$. We posit that the appearance of
r-modes in observations may be more determined by a competition between
excitation and damping mechanisms near the ISCO than the modification of the
trapping region by magnetic fields.

spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition suppresses the output firing activity of
a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect
on a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the
range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to
non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it
modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing
activity. Since these two ""modes"" of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural
coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that
distinguish these response profiles.
  We use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the
specific conditions for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive
effects. We identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our
model, this fast-activating, slowly- inactivating outward current acts as a
switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. If IA is strong (large
maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike

contrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has
a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical
systems methods to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic
inputs and IA.
  Our findings suggest that neurons can ""self-regulate"" the gain control
effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation
of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role
for IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent

constant problem, since the vacuum energy density of quantum fields does not
gravitate in this framework, and the cosmological constant appears as an
integration constant. These features arise as a consequence of considering a
constrained volume element 4-form that breaks the diffeomorphisms invariance
down to volume preserving diffeomorphisms. In this work, the first-order
formulation of unimodular gravity is presented by considering the spin density
of matter fields as a source of spacetime torsion. Even though the most general
matter Lagrangian allowed by the symmetries is considered, dynamical
restrictions arise on their functional dependence. The field equations are
obtained and the conservation laws associated with the symmetries are derived.
It is found that, analogous to torsion-free unimodular gravity, the field
equation for the vierbein is traceless; nevertheless, torsion is algebraically
related to the spin density as in standard Einstein-Cartan theory. The
particular example of massless Dirac spinors is studied, and comparisons with
standard Einstein-Cartan theory are shown.

merger remnants, rapidly transitioning to quiescence, has been recently
challenged. Unexpected detections of a significant ISM in many post-starbursts
raise important questions. Are they truly quiescent and, if so, what mechanisms
inhibit further star formation? What processes dominate their ISM energetics?
We present an infrared spectroscopic and photometric survey of 33 SDSS-selected
E+A post-starbursts, aimed at resolving these questions. We find compact, warm
dust reservoirs with high PAH abundances, and total gas and dust masses
significantly higher than expected from stellar recycling alone. Both PAH/TIR
and dust-to-burst stellar mass ratios are seen to decrease with post-burst age,
indicative of the accumulating effects of dust destruction and an incipient
transition to hot, early-type ISM properties. Their infrared spectral
properties are unique, with dominant PAH emission, very weak nebular lines,
unusually strong H$_{2}$ rotational emission, and deep ${\rm [C\, II]}$
deficits. There is substantial scatter among SFR indicators, and both PAH and
TIR luminosities provide overestimates. Even as potential upper limits, all
tracers show that the SFR has typically experienced a more than two
order-of-magnitude decline since the starburst, and that the SFR is
considerably lower than expected given both their stellar masses and molecular
gas densities. These results paint a coherent picture of systems in which star
formation was, indeed, rapidly truncated, but in which the ISM was
$\textit{not}$ completely expelled, and is instead supported against collapse
by latent or continued injection of turbulent or mechanical heating. The
resulting aging burst populations provide a ""high-soft"" radiation field which

properties of its stars are considered evidence for mass driving the evolution
of the stellar population. However, for early-type galaxies (ETGs), we find
that $g-i$ color and stellar metallicity [Z/H] correlate more strongly with
gravitational potential $\Phi$ than with mass $M$, whereas stellar population
age correlates best with surface density $\Sigma$. Specifically, for our sample
of 625 ETGs with integral-field spectroscopy from the SAMI Galaxy Survey,
compared to correlations with mass, the color--$\Phi$, [Z/H]--$\Phi$, and
age--$\Sigma$ relations show both smaller scatter and less residual trend with
galaxy size. For the star formation duration proxy [$\alpha$/Fe], we find
comparable results for trends with $\Phi$ and $\Sigma$, with both being
significantly stronger than the [$\alpha$/Fe]-$M$ relation. In determining the
strength of a trend, we analyze both the overall scatter, and the observational
uncertainty on the parameters, in order to compare the intrinsic scatter in
each correlation. These results lead us to the following inferences and
interpretations: (1) the color--$\Phi$ diagram is a more precise tool for
determining the developmental stage of the stellar population than the
conventional color--mass diagram; and (2) gravitational potential is the
primary regulator of global stellar metallicity, via its relation to the gas
escape velocity. Furthermore, we propose the following two mechanisms for the
age and [$\alpha$/Fe] relations with $\Sigma$: (a) the age--$\Sigma$ and
[$\alpha$/Fe]--$\Sigma$ correlations arise as results of compactness driven

have revisited wave dissipation under galaxy cluster conditions in a way that
accounts for the self limiting nature of dissipation by electron thermal
conduction, allows the electron and ion temperature perturbations in the waves
to evolve separately, and estimates kinetic effects by comparing to a
semi-collisionless theory. While these effects considerably enlarge the toolkit

noticeable sensitivity of the 1p-emission observables to the scattering length

taking the spin-dependence of the proton-$\Lambda^0$ interaction into account,
a remarkable split of the $J^{\pi}=1^-$ and $2^-$ 1p-resonance states is
predicted. It is also suggested that, if the spin-singlet proton-$\Lambda^0$
interaction is sufficiently attractive, the 1p emission from the $1^-$ ground
state is forbidden. From these results, I conclude that the 1p emission can be
a suitable phenomenon to investigate the basic properties of the hypernuclear
interaction, for which a direct measurement is still difficult.

use modern broadband polarimetric techniques to examine the nature and origin

with complicated frequency-dependent interference in the polarized signal

spatially correlated with interfaces in the magnetic structure of the lobe,
across which the line-of-sight-projected magnetic field changes direction.
Spatial correlations with the sky-projected magnetic field orientation and

the low-$p$ patches, along with associated reversals in the line-of-sight
magnetic field and other related phenomena, are best explained by the presence
of $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ $M_\odot$ of magnetized thermal plasma in the lobes,
structured in shells or filaments, and likely advected from the ISM of NCG 1316

neutron stars occurs in new QCD phases at large densities, with the vacuum
energy appearing in the equation of state for a new phase. This in turn leads
to a change in the internal structure of neutron stars and influences their
tidal deformabilities which are measurable in the chirp signals of merging
neutron stars. By considering three commonly used neutron star models we show
that for large chirp masses the effect of vacuum energy on the tidal
deformabilities can be sizable. Measurements of this sort have the potential to
provide a first test of the gravitational properties of vacuum energy

Drell-Yan-like contributions are consistently taken into account by a simple
rescaling of the SM result, the gluon-initiated contribution is supplemented by
squark-loop mediated amplitudes, and by the $s$-channel exchange of additional
scalars which may lead to conspicuous interference effects. The latter holds as
well for bottom-quark initiated Higgs Strahlung, which is also included in the
new version of vh@nnlo. Using an orthogonal rotation of the three Higgs CP
eigenstates in the 2HDM and the MSSM, vh@nnlo incorporates a simple means of CP
mixing in these models. Moreover, the effect of vector-like quarks in the SM on
the gluon-initiated contribution can be studied. Beyond concrete models,
vh@nnlo allows to include the effect of higher-dimensional operators on the
production of CP-even Higgs bosons. Transverse momentum distributions of the
final state Higgs boson and invariant mass distributions of the $V\phi$ final
state for the gluon- and bottom-quark initiated contributions can be studied.
Distributions for the Drell-Yan-like component of Higgs-Strahlung can be
included through a link to MCFM. vh@nnlo can also be linked to FeynHiggs and
2HDMC for the calculation of Higgs masses and mixing angles. It can also read

increased research interests in medical predictive modeling. Recently many deep
learning based predicted models are also developed for EHR data and
demonstrated impressive performance. However, a series of recent studies showed
that these deep models are not safe: they suffer from certain vulnerabilities.
In short, a well-trained deep network can be extremely sensitive to inputs with
negligible changes. These inputs are referred to as adversarial examples. In
the context of medical informatics, such attacks could alter the result of a
high performance deep predictive model by slightly perturbing a patient's

architectures, more importantly, it offers guide on detecting susceptible parts
on the inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework
that learns a time-preferential minimum attack targeting the LSTM model with
EHR inputs, and we leverage this attack strategy to screen medical records of
patients and identify susceptible events and measurements. The efficient
screening procedure can assist decision makers to pay extra attentions to the
locations that can cause severe consequence if not measured correctly. We
conduct extensive empirical studies on a real-world urgent care cohort and

admits --- as an explicit solution --- a `fully localised' or `lump' solitary

efficient coherence protection of the NV spin, yielding a nearly two orders of

enlthalpic preference for local alignment, among like-block segments. We
describe a generalization of the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of
flexible BCPs to include inter-segment orientational interactions via a
Landau-DeGennes free energy associated with a polar or nematic order parameter
for segments of one component of a diblock copolymer. We study the equilibrium
states of this model numerically, using a pseudo-spectral approach to solve for
chain conformation statistics in the presence of a self-consistent torque
generated by inter-segment alignment forces. Applying this theory to the
structure of lamellar domains composed of symmetric diblocks possessing a
single block of ""self-aligning"", polar segments, we show the emergence of
spatially complex segment order parameters (segment director fields) within a
given lamellar domain. Because BCP phase separation gives rise to spatially
inhomogeneous orientation order of segments even in the absence of explicit
intra-segment aligning forces, the director fields of BCPs, as well as
thermodynamics of lamellar domain formation, exhibit a highly non-linear
dependence on both the inter-block segregation ($\chi N$) and the enthalpy of
alignment ($\varepsilon$). Specifically, we predict the stability of new phases
of lamellar order in which distinct regions of alignment coexist within a
single mesodomain, and which spontaneously break the symmetry of the lamella
pattern of composition in the melt via in-plane tilt of the director in the
centers of the like-composition domains. We show further that, in analogy to a
Freedericksz transition in confined nematics, that the elastic costs to
reorient segments within the domain, as described by Frank elasticity, increase
the threshold value $\varepsilon$ needed to induce this intra-domain phase
transition.

Specifically, in this paper we (1) incorporate saturation in a point process

We provide the first observation of a `protein-like' dynamical transition in

their investigation to unprecedentedly high concentrations. Owing to the
heterogeneous architecture of the microgels, water crystallization is avoided
in concentrated samples, allowing us to monitor atomic dynamics at low
temperatures. By elastic incoherent neutron scattering and molecular dynamics
simulations, we find that a dynamical transition occurs at a temperature
$T_d\sim250$~K, independently from PNIPAM mass fraction. However, the
transition is smeared out on approaching dry conditions. The quantitative
agreement between experiments and simulations provides evidence that the
transition occurs simultaneously for PNIPAM and water dynamics. The similarity
of these results with hydrated protein powders suggests that the dynamical
transition is a generic feature in complex macromolecular systems,
independently from their biological function.

two states. In the first state the rat is sedated and merely observed and in
the other it is repeatedly simulated via electric shocks. We first started by
controlling for the movement of the brain to more accurately observe the
physical characteristics of the brain. We analyzed how the variance of the
brain images varied between pre and post stimulus by applying Levene's Test.
Furthermore, we were able to measure how much the images were shifted to see

  swarm",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we theoretically investigate underlying assumptions that have
been used for designing adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithms in the
past years. We relate these assumptions to the movement patterns of particles
controlled by coefficient values (inertia weight and acceleration coefficient)
and introduce three factors, namely the autocorrelation of the particle
positions, the average movement distance of the particle in each iteration, and
the focus of the search, that describe these movement patterns. We show how
these factors represent movement patterns of a particle within a swarm and how
they are affected by particle coefficients (i.e., inertia weight and
acceleration coefficients). We derive equations that provide exact coefficient
values to guarantee achieving a desired movement pattern defined by these three
factors within a swarm. We then relate these movements to the searching
capability of particles and provide guideline for designing potentially
successful adaptive methods to control coefficients in particle swarm. Finally,
we propose a new simple time adaptive particle swarm and compare its results
with previous adaptive particle swarm approaches. Our experiments show that the
theoretical findings indeed provide a beneficial guideline for successful
adaptation of the coefficients in the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

$\mathcal{U}\left(n\right)$ of unitary matrices.
  More concretely, we study measures induced by free words on

To sample a random element from $\mathcal{U}\left(n\right)$ according to the
measure induced by $w\in F_{r}$, one substitutes the $r$ letters in $w$ by $r$
independent, Haar-random elements from $\mathcal{U}\left(n\right)$. The main
theme of this paper is that every moment of this measure is determined by
families of pairs $\left(\Sigma,f\right)$, where $\Sigma$ is an orientable
surface with boundary, and $f$ is a map from $\Sigma$ to the bouquet of $r$
circles, which sends the boundary components of $\Sigma$ to powers of $w$. A
crucial role is then played by Euler characteristics of subgroups of the
mapping class group of $\Sigma$.

predicting new links for a knowledge graph given the existing links among the
entities. Tensor factorization approaches have proved promising for such link
prediction problems. Proposed in 1927, Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition is
among the first tensor factorization approaches. CP generally performs poorly
for link prediction as it learns two independent embedding vectors for each
entity, whereas they are really tied. We present a simple enhancement of CP
(which we call SimplE) to allow the two embeddings of each entity to be learned
dependently. The complexity of SimplE grows linearly with the size of
embeddings. The embeddings learned through SimplE are interpretable, and
certain types of background knowledge can be incorporated into these embeddings
through weight tying. We prove SimplE is fully expressive and derive a bound on
the size of its embeddings for full expressivity. We show empirically that,
despite its simplicity, SimplE outperforms several state-of-the-art tensor

models, where possible, until they have produced a first hydrostatic core.
Models with $\zeta_\text{cr}\gtrsim10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$ are indistinguishable

hydrodynamical collapse, and even lower ionisation rates may be required for
larger $a_\text{g}$. Thus, it is possible to reproduce ideal MHD and purely

incurring additional computational cost compared with SGD. The HiGrad procedure
begins by performing SGD updates for a while and then splits the single thread
into several threads, and this procedure hierarchically operates in this
fashion along each thread. With predictions provided by multiple threads in
place, a t-based confidence interval is constructed by decorrelating
predictions using covariance structures given by a Donsker-style extension of
the Ruppert--Polyak averaging scheme, which is a technical contribution of
independent interest. Under certain regularity conditions, the HiGrad
confidence interval is shown to attain asymptotically exact coverage
probability. Finally, the performance of HiGrad is evaluated through extensive
simulation studies and a real data example. An R package higrad has been

variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to produce sketch drawings. We use a
Latent Constraints GAN (LC-GAN) to learn from the facial feedback of a small
group of viewers, by optimizing the model to produce sketches that it predicts
will lead to more positive facial expressions. We show in multiple independent
evaluations that the model trained with facial feedback produced sketches that
are more highly rated, and induce significantly more positive facial
expressions. Thus, we establish that implicit social feedback can improve the
output of a deep learning model.

from satellite ones (e.g., compression schemes, post-processing, sensors,

to fail if blindly applied to overhead image analysis. Development of novel
forensic tools for satellite images is paramount to assess their authenticity

forgery detection and localization. Specifically, we consider the scenario in
which pixels within a region of a satellite image are replaced to add or remove
an object from the scene. Our algorithm works under the assumption that no
forged images are available for training. Using a generative adversarial
network (GAN), we learn a feature representation of pristine satellite images.
A one-class support vector machine (SVM) is trained on these features to
determine their distribution. Finally, image forgeries are detected as
anomalies. The proposed algorithm is validated against different kinds of
satellite images containing forgeries of different size and shape.

the United States or U.S. interests. An intelligence analyst has observed some
signals, but the situation is rapidly changing. The analyst faces the decision
to alert a principal decision maker that an attack is imminent, or to wait
until more is known about the situation. This warning decision is based on the
analyst's observation and evaluation of signals, independent or correlated, and
on her updating of the prior probabilities of possible scenarios and their
outcomes. The warning decision also depends on the analyst's assessment of the
crisis' dynamics and perception of the preferences of the principal decision
maker, as well as the lead time needed for an appropriate response. This
article presents a model to support this analyst's dynamic warning decision. As
with most problems involving warning, the key is to manage the tradeoffs
between false positives and false negatives given the probabilities and the
consequences of intelligence failures of both types. The model is illustrated
by revisiting the case of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. It shows
that the radio silence of the Japanese fleet carried considerable information
(Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""dog in the night"" problem), which was misinterpreted
at the time. Even though the probabilities of different attacks were relatively
low, their consequences were such that the Bayesian dynamic reasoning described

  It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p values unless

conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p value. This number could
be the minimum false positive risk (that calculated on the assumption of a
prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence

Two particle-scale directional density distribution functions, namely the
directional distribution of a combined mechano-geometrical property and the
directional distribution of a purely geometrical property, are proposed and
parametrized by five independent parameters. Five independent components of the
symmetrized tangent stiffness tensor are also determined from discrete particle

part associated with the spacetime metric and its antisymmetric part associated
with the electromagnetic field, as an approach to a unified field theory. Here
we interpret it more modestly as an alternative to Einstein-Maxwell theory,
approximating the coupling between the electromagnetic field and spacetime
curvature in the macroscopic classical regime. Previously it was shown that the
Lorentz force can be derived from this theory, albeit with deviation on the
scale of a universal length constant $\ell$. Here we assume that $\ell$ is of
galactic scale and show that the modified coupling of the electromagnetic field
with charged particles allows a non-Maxwellian equilibrium of non-neutral
plasma. The resulting electromagnetic field is ""dark"" in the sense that its
modified Lorentz force on the plasma vanishes, yet through its modified
coupling to the gravitational field it engenders a nonvanishing, effective mass
density. We obtain a solution for which this mass density asymptotes
approximately to that of the pseudo-isothermal model of dark matter. The
resulting gravitational field produces radial acceleration, in the context of a
post-Minkowskian approximation, which is negligible at small radius but yields
a flat rotation curve at large radius. We further exhibit a family of such
solutions which, like the pseudo-isothermal model, has a free parameter to set
the mass scale (in this case related to the charge density) and a free
parameter to set the length scale (in this case an integer multiple of $\ell$).
Moreover, these solutions are members of a larger family with more general
angular and radial dependence. They thus show promise as approximations of
generalized pseudo-isothermal models, which in turn are known to fit a wide
range of mass density profiles for galaxies and clusters.

properties. In so doing, we solve a long-standing problem of eliciting
multiple, continuously valued treatment policies, using an updated framework
and corresponding set of assumptions, which we term the inverse classification
potential outcomes framework (ICPOF), along with a new measure, referred to as
the individual future estimated effects ($i$FEE). We also develop the
approximate propensity score (APS), based on Gaussian processes, to weight
treatments, much like the inverse propensity score weighting used in past
works. We demonstrate the viability of our methods on student performance.

using a Krylov method is to accurately estimate errors when convergence is
slow. Apart from the case of the exponential function which has been
extensively studied in the past, there are no well-established solutions to the
problem. Often the quantity of interest in applications is not the matrix
$f(A)$ itself, but rather, matrix-vector products or bilinear forms. When the
computation related to $f(A)$ is a building block of a larger problem (e.g.,
approximately computing its trace), a consequence of the lack of reliable error
estimates is that the accuracy of the computed result is unknown. In this
paper, we consider the problem of computing $\mathrm{tr}(f(A))$ for a symmetric
positive-definite matrix $A$ by using the Lanczos method and make two
contributions: (i) we propose an error estimate for the bilinear form
associated with $f(A)$, and (ii) an error estimate for the trace of $f(A)$. We
demonstrate the practical usefulness of these estimates for large matrices and
in particular, show that the trace error estimate is indicative of the number
of accurate digits. As an application, we compute the log-determinant of a
covariance matrix in Gaussian process analysis and underline the importance of
error tolerance as a stopping criterion, as a means of bounding the number of
Lanczos steps to achieve a desired accuracy.

extended bald-patch sections for the successful eruption. The internal
reconnection is signified by brightenings in the body of one filament and
between the rising and remaining parts of both filaments. It evolves quickly

the regime of localization that is realized for the strong coupling, the

Unfortunately, we cannot make a definite conclusion about the case with the

Although the potential of the model is not quasi-periodic, the energy spectrum
is known to be a Cantor set with zero Lebesgue measure. Our numerical results

interested in reconstructing only a few components of the parameter. This
problem arises for example when monitoring the high-dimensional distributed

estimate of the parameter components in its interest set by simultaneously
processing the latest locally sensed information~(\emph{innovations}) and the
parameter estimates from agents~(\emph{consensus}) in its communication
neighborhood given by a time-varying possibly sparse graph. Under minimal
conditions on the inter-agent communication network and the sensing models,
almost sure convergence of the estimate sequence at each agent to the
components of the true parameter in its interest set is established.
Furthermore, the paper establishes the performance of $\mathcal{CIRFE}$ in
terms of asymptotic covariance of the estimate sequences and specifically
characterizes the dependencies of the component wise asymptotic covariance in
terms of the number of agents tasked with estimating it. Finally, simulation

network (CNN) to work with arbitrarily structured graphs. A binary adjacency
matrix is commonly used in training a GCN. Recently, the attention mechanism
allows the network to learn a dynamic and adaptive aggregation of the
neighborhood. We propose a new GCN model on the graphs where edges are
characterized in multiple views or precisely in terms of multiple
relationships. For instance, in chemical graph theory, compound structures are
often represented by the hydrogen-depleted molecular graph where nodes
correspond to atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. Multiple attributes
can be important to characterize chemical bonds, such as atom pair (the types
of atoms that a bond connects), aromaticity, and whether a bond is in a ring.
The different attributes lead to different graph representations for the same
molecule. There is growing interests in both chemistry and machine learning
fields to directly learn molecular properties of compounds from the molecular
graph, instead of from fingerprints predefined by chemists. The proposed GCN
model, which we call edge attention-based multi-relational GCN (EAGCN), jointly
learns attention weights and node features in graph convolution. For each bond
attribute, a real-valued attention matrix is used to replace the binary
adjacency matrix. By designing a dictionary for the edge attention, and forming
the attention matrix of each molecule by looking up the dictionary, the EAGCN
exploits correspondence between bonds in different molecules. The prediction of
compound properties is based on the aggregated node features, which is
independent of the varying molecule (graph) size. We demonstrate the efficacy
of the EAGCN on multiple chemical datasets: Tox21, HIV, Freesolv, and
Lipophilicity, and interpret the resultant attention weights.

is multi-versioned, and each version uniquely identifies the data content and
its history. Two variants of fork semantics are supported in ForkBase to
facilitate any collaboration workflows. A novel index structure is introduced
to efficiently identify and eliminate duplicate content across data objects.
Consequently, ForkBase is not only efficient in performance, but also in space
requirement. We demonstrate the performance of ForkBase using three
applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative

economic systems as they explicitly show conceptual links between different
types of entities. However, applications of such networks often work with a
projected (one-mode) version of the original bipartite network. The topology of
the projected network, and the dynamics that take place on it, are highly
dependent on the degree distributions of the two different node types from the
original bipartite structure. To date, the interaction between the degree
distributions of bipartite networks and their one-mode projections is well
understood for only a few cases, or for networks that satisfy a restrictive set
of assumptions. Here we show a broader analysis in order to fill the gap left
by previous studies. We use the formalism of generating functions to prove that
the degree distributions of both node types in the original bipartite network
affect the degree distribution in the projected version. To support our
analysis, we simulate several types of synthetic bipartite networks using a
configuration model where node degrees are assigned from specific probability
distributions, ranging from peaked to heavy-tailed distributions. Our findings
show that when projecting a bipartite network onto a particular set of nodes,
the degree distribution for the resulting one-mode network follows the
distribution of the nodes being projected on to, but only so long as the degree
distribution for the opposite set of nodes does not have a heavier tail.
Furthermore, we show that bipartite degree distributions are not the only
feature driving topology formation of projected networks, in contrast to what
is commonly described in the literature.

$d:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \R$ between inputs. In particular,
we propose a general framework to derive a family of \emph{positive definite

\emph{representative-set method} as a special case, and relates to the
well-known \emph{distance substitution kernel} in a limiting case. We show that
functions in the corresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) are
Lipschitz-continuous w.r.t. the given distance metric. We provide a tractable
algorithm to estimate a function from this RKHS, and show that it enjoys better
generalizability than Nearest-Neighbor estimates. Our approach draws from the
literature of Random Features, but instead of deriving feature maps from an
existing kernel, we construct novel kernels from a random feature map, that we
specify given the distance measure. We conduct classification experiments with
such disparate domains as strings, time series, and sets of vectors, where our

Ignoring the equilibrium deformation due to the magnetic field, we employ a
polytrope of the index $n=1$ as the background model for our modal analyses.
For the mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic field with $\zeta_0\not=0$,
axisymmetric spheroidal and toroidal modes are coupled. We compute axisymmetric
spheroidal and toroidal magnetic modes as a function of the parameter $\zeta_0$
from $0$ to $\sim 1$ for the surface field strengths $B_S=10^{14}$G and
$10^{15}$G. We find that the frequency $\omega$ of the magnetic modes decreases
with increasing $\zeta_0$. We also find that the frequency of the spheroidal
magnetic modes is almost exactly proportional to $B_S$ for $\zeta_0\lesssim 1$
but that this proportionality holds only when $\zeta_0\ll 1$ for the toroidal
magnetic modes. The wave patterns of the spheroidal magnetic modes and toroidal

but block labels are only observed for a few of the vertices in the network.
Utilizing a graph realized from the model and the observed block labels, the
vertex nomination task is to order the vertices with unobserved block labels
into a ranked nomination list with the goal of having an abundance of
interesting vertices near the top of the list. There are vertex nomination
schemes in the literature, including the optimally precise canonical nomination
scheme~$\mathcal{L}^C$ and the consistent spectral partitioning nomination
scheme~$\mathcal{L}^P$. While the canonical nomination scheme $\mathcal{L}^C$
is provably optimally precise, it is computationally intractable, being
impractical to implement even on modestly sized graphs. With this in mind, an
approximation of the canonical scheme---denoted the {\it canonical sampling
nomination scheme} $\mathcal{L}^{CS}$---is introduced; $\mathcal{L}^{CS}$
relies on a scalable, Markov chain Monte Carlo-based approximation of
$\mathcal{L}^{C}$, and converges to $\mathcal{L}^{C}$ as the amount of sampling
goes to infinity. The spectral partitioning nomination scheme is also extended
to the {\it extended spectral partitioning nomination scheme},
$\mathcal{L}^{EP}$, which introduces a novel semisupervised clustering
framework to improve upon the precision of $\mathcal{L}^P$. Real-data and
simulation experiments are employed to illustrate the precision of these vertex
nomination schemes, as well as their empirical computational complexity.

gas-particle system is proposed. The UGKS multiphase (UGKS-M) is a finite
volume method, which captures flow physics in the regimes from collisionless
multispecies transport to the two-fluid hydrodynamic Navier-Stokes (NS)
solution with the variation of Knudsen number, and from granular flow regime to
dusty gas dynamics with the variation of Stokes number. The main reason for
preserving the multiscale nature in UGKS-M is mainly coming from the direct
modeling of the flow physics in the scales of discrete cell size and time step,
where the ratio of the time step over the particle collision time determines
flow behavior in different regimes. For the particle phase, the integral
solution of the kinetic equation is used in the construction of the numerical
flux, which takes into account the particle transport, collision, and
acceleration. The gas phase, which is assumed to be in the continuum flow
regime, evolves numerically by the gas kinetic scheme (GKS), which is a subset
of the UGKS for the Navier-Stokes (NS) solutions. The interaction between the
gas and particle phase is calculated based on a velocity space mapping method,
which solves accurately the kinetic acceleration process. The stability of
UGKS-M is determined by the CFL condition only. With the inclusion of the
material temperature evolution equation of solid particles, the UGKS-M
conserves the total mass, momentum, and energy for the whole multiphase system.
In the numerical tests, the UGKS-M shows good multiscale property in capturing
the particle trajectory crossing (PTC), particle wall reflecting phenomena, and
vortex-induced segregation of inertial particles under different Stokes
numbers. The scheme is also applied to simulate shock induced fluidization
problem and the simulation results agree well with experimental measurement.

While the median might not exist in all cases, we show that a mass-regularized
median is guaranteed to exist. When the input shapes are modeled by integral
currents with shared boundaries in codimension $1$, we show that the median is
guaranteed to exist, and is contained in the \emph{envelope} of the input
currents. On the other hand, we show that medians can be \emph{wild} in this
setting, and smooth inputs can generate non-smooth medians.
  For higher codimensions, we show that \emph{books} are minimizing for a
finite set of $1$-currents in $\Bbb{R}^3$ with shared boundaries. As part of
this proof, we present a new result in graph theory---that \emph{cozy} graphs
are \emph{comfortable}---which should be of independent interest. Further, we
show that regular points on the median have book-like tangent cones in this
case.
  From the point of view of computation, we study the median shape in the
settings of a finite simplicial complex. When the input shapes are represented
by chains of the simplicial complex, we show that the problem of finding the
median shape can be formulated as an integer linear program. This optimization
problem can be solved as a linear program in practice, thus allowing one to
compute median shapes efficiently.

features (configuration options) to mark the variable functionality. In many of
the applications, their quality assurance and formal verification are of
paramount importance. Family-based model checking allows simultaneous
verification of all variants of a variational system in a single run by
exploiting the commonalities between the variants. Yet, its computational cost
still greatly depends on the number of variants (often huge).
  In this work, we show how to achieve efficient family-based model checking of
CTL* temporal properties using variability abstractions and off-the-shelf
(single-system) tools. We use variability abstractions for deriving abstract
family-based model checking, where the variability model of a variational
system is replaced with an abstract (smaller) version of it, called modal
featured transition system, which preserves the satisfaction of both universal
and existential temporal properties, as expressible in CTL*. Modal featured
transition systems contain two kinds of transitions, termed may and must
transitions, which are defined by the conservative (over-approximating)
abstractions and their dual (under-approximating) abstractions, respectively.
The variability abstractions can be combined with different partitionings of
the set of variants to infer suitable divide-and-conquer verification plans for
the variational system. We illustrate the practicality of this approach for
several variational systems.

(AUGKS) for multiscale flow transport will be developed. In near-equilibrium
flow regions, particle distribution function is close to the Chapman-Enskog
expansion and can be formulated with a continuous velocity space, where only
macroscopic conservative variables are updated. With the emerging of
non-equilibrium effects, the AUGKS automatically switches to a discrete
velocity space to follow the evolution of particle distribution function. Based
on the Chapman-Enskog expansion, a criterion is proposed in this paper to
quantify the intensity of non-equilibrium effects and is used for the
continuous-discrete velocity space transformation. Following the
scale-dependent local evolution solution, the AUGKS presents the discretized
gas dynamic equations directly on the cell size and time step scales, i.e., the
so-called direct modeling method. As a result, the scheme is able to capture
the cross-scale flow physics from particle transport to hydrodynamic wave
propagation, and provides a continuous variation of solutions from the
Boltzmann to the Navier-Stokes. Under the unified framework, different from
conventional DSMC-NS hybrid method, the AUGKS does not need a buffer zone to
match up kinetic and hydrodynamic solutions. Instead, a continuous and discrete
particle velocity space is naturally connected, which is feasible for the
numerical simulations with unsteadiness or complex geometries. Compared with
the asymptotic preserving (AP) methods which solves kinetic equations uniformly
over the entire flow field with discretized velocity space, the current
velocity-space adaptive unified scheme speeds up the computation and reduces
the memory requirement in multiscale flow problems, and maintains the
equivalent accuracy. The AUGKS provides an effective tool for non-equilibrium

of dissipation inequalities in control theory. In particular, we consider flows
with body and other forcings, for which we study the input- to-output
properties, including energy growth, worst-case disturbance amplification, and
stability to persistent disturbances. The proposed method can be applied to a
large class of flow configurations as long as the base flow is described by a
polynomial. This includes many examples in both channel flows and pipe flows,

numerically implemented as the solution of a (convex) optimization problem. We
use the framework to study input-output amplification mechanisms in rotating

leads to results that are consistent with theoretical and experimental

limitations of low-dimensional systems. States with a positive partial
transpose (PPT), on the other hand, are generally considered weakly entangled,
as they can never be distilled into pure entangled states. This naturally
raises the question, whether high Schmidt numbers are possible for PPT states.
Volume estimates suggest that optimal, i.e. linear, scaling in local dimension
should be possible, albeit without providing an insight into the possible
slope. We provide the first explicit construction of a family of PPT states
that achieves linear scaling in local dimension and we prove that random PPT
states typically share this feature. Our construction also allows us to answer
a recent question by Chen et al. on the existence of PPT states whose Schmidt
number increases by an arbitrarily large amount upon partial transposition.
Finally, we link the Schmidt number to entangled sub-block matrices of a
quantum state. We use this connection to prove that quantum states invariant
under partial transposition on the smaller of their two subsystems cannot have
maximal Schmidt number. This generalizes a well-known result by Kraus et al. We
also show that the Schmidt number of absolutely PPT states cannot be maximal,

a deep neural network (DNN) with minimal performance degradation in order to
use DNNs in embedded systems. Among the model compression methods, a method
called knowledge transfer is to train a student network with a stronger teacher
network. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method which uses
convolutional operations to paraphrase teacher's knowledge and to translate it
for the student. This is done by two convolutional modules, which are called a
paraphraser and a translator. The paraphraser is trained in an unsupervised
manner to extract the teacher factors which are defined as paraphrased
information of the teacher network. The translator located at the student
network extracts the student factors and helps to translate the teacher factors
by mimicking them. We observed that our student network trained with the
proposed factor transfer method outperforms the ones trained with conventional
knowledge transfer methods.

Firstly, a sample-based background model that integrates color and texture cues
is built and updated over time. Secondly, multiple heterogeneous features
(including brightness variation, chromaticity variation, and texture variation)
are extracted by comparing the input frame with the background model, and a
multi-source learning strategy is designed to online estimate the probability
distributions for both foreground and background. The three features are
approximately conditionally independent, making multi-source learning feasible.
Pixel-wise foreground posteriors are then estimated with Bayes rule. Finally,
the Markov random field (MRF) optimization and heuristic post-processing
techniques are used sequentially to improve accuracy. In particular, a
two-layer MRF model is constructed to represent pixel-based and
superpixel-based contextual constraints compactly. Experimental results on the
CDnet dataset indicate that M4CD is robust under complex environments and ranks
among the top methods.

analysis of massive particles due to quantum and thermal fluctuations in a wide
class of strongly coupled quantum field theories. The underlying reason for the
existence of such unified study scheme, is that our analytic methods turn out
to heavily depend on the order of the Bessel functions $\nu$, describing the
string fluctuations attached to the particle. Different values of the order are
associated to different theories.
  The two-point function of the fluctuations exhibits two different late time
behaviors, depending purely on the value of the order of Bessel functions. We
then find that the coefficients and observables associated with the stochastic
motion at zero and finite temperature, depend on the scales of the theory
through powers of the order $\nu$. Moreover, the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem is verified from the bulk perspective to be universally satisfied for
the whole class of theories. Finally, we show that the analysis of certain
types of Dp-brane fluctuations can be mapped one-to-one to the string
fluctuations and therefore the stochastic brane observables can be read from
the string ones. In the closing remarks we demonstrate how our analysis
accommodates known results as special cases and provide more applications.

condition, which appears {\em a priori} to be quite restrictive, and is not

of the Coulomb blockade of electronic heat flow from a small metallic circuit

inter-channel correlations that give rise to such selective heat current

created subsamples by applying different total flux thresholds limit (S >> 5

omega(theta) of point sources at large scales ( >= 1 degree). We find that the
amplitude of angular clustering is higher for brighter subsamples, this
indicates that higher threshold flux samples are hosted by massive halos and
cluster strongly: this conclusions is based on the assumption that the redshift
distribution of sources does not change with flux and this is supported by
models of radio sources. We compare our results with other low-frequency
studies of clustering of point sources and verify that the amplitude of
clustering varies with the flux limit. We quantify this variation as a power
law dependence of the amplitude of correlation function with the flux limit.
This dependence can be used to estimate foreground contamination due to
clustering of point sources for low frequency HI intensity mapping surveys for
studying the epoch of reionisation.

logging into online services. Using high entropy passwords is critical to
prevent unauthorized access and password policies emerged to enforce this
requirement on passwords. However, with current methods of password storage,
poor practices and server breaches have leaked many passwords to the public. To
protect one's sensitive information in case of such events, passwords should be
hidden from servers. Verifier-based password authenticated key exchange,
proposed by Bellovin and Merrit (IEEE S\&P, 1992), allows authenticated secure
channels to be established with a hash of a password (verifier). Unfortunately,
this restricts password policies as passwords cannot be checked from their
verifier. To address this issue, Kiefer and Manulis (ESORICS 2014) proposed
zero-knowledge password policy check (ZKPPC). A ZKPPC protocol allows users to
prove in zero knowledge that a hash of the user's password satisfies the
password policy required by the server. Unfortunately, their proposal is not
quantum resistant with the use of discrete logarithm-based cryptographic tools
and there are currently no other viable alternatives. In this work, we
construct the first post-quantum ZKPPC using lattice-based tools. To this end,
we introduce a new randomised password hashing scheme for ASCII-based passwords
and design an accompanying zero-knowledge protocol for policy compliance.
Interestingly, our proposal does not follow the framework established by Kiefer
and Manulis and offers an alternate construction without homomorphic
commitments. Although our protocol is not ready to be used in practice, we
think it is an important first step towards a quantum-resistant
privacy-preserving password-based authentication and key exchange system.

been used to estimate dynamic treatment effects in the context of
time-dependent confounding affected by prior treatment when faced with long
follow-up times, multiple time-varying confounders, and complex associational
relationships simultaneously. Reasons for this include the potential
computational burden, technical challenges, restricted modeling options for
long follow-up times, and limited practical guidance in the literature.
However, LTMLE has desirable asymptotic properties, i.e. it is doubly robust,
and can yield valid inference when used in conjunction with machine learning.
We use a topical and sophisticated question from HIV treatment research to show
that LTMLE can be used successfully in complex realistic settings and compare
results to competing estimators. Our example illustrates the following
practical challenges common to many epidemiological studies 1) long follow-up
time (30 months), 2) gradually declining sample size 3) limited support for
some intervention rules of interest 4) a high-dimensional set of potential
adjustment variables, increasing both the need and the challenge of integrating
appropriate machine learning methods 5) consideration of collider bias. Our
analyses, as well as simulations, shed new light on the application of LTMLE in
complex and realistic settings: we show that (i) LTMLE can yield stable and
good estimates, even when confronted with small samples and limited modeling
options; (ii) machine learning utilized with a small set of simple learners (if
more complex ones can't be fitted) can outperform a single, complex model,
which is tailored to incorporate prior clinical knowledge; (iii) performance
can vary considerably depending on interventions and their support in the data,
and therefore critical quality checks should accompany every LTMLE analysis.

characterizing the longitudinal properties of an electron bunch in a linear
accelerator. The standard use of such a cavity involves streaking the bunch
along a transverse axis and analysing the image on a screen downstream to find
the bunch length and slice properties along the other transverse axis. A novel
X-band deflecting structure, which will allow the polarization of the
deflecting field to be adjusted, is currently being designed as part of a
collaboration between CERN, DESY and PSI. This new design will allow bunches to
be streaked at any transverse angle within the cavity, which will open up the
possibility of new measurement techniques, which could be combined to
characterize the 6D phase space distribution of bunches. In this paper, a
method is presented for reconstructing the longitudinal phase space
distribution of bunches by using the TDS in combination with a dipole.
Simulations of this technique for the SINBAD-ARES beamline are presented and
the key limitations related to temporal resolution and induced energy spread

known results from literature by relaxing the assumption of homogeneous

disease to provide expressions for the basic reproduction number R0, the
probability of a major outbreak and the expected final size. In addition, the
impact of random vaccination with a perfect vaccine on the final outcome of the

direct knowledge transfer (the book includes the scientist's research topics),
indirect knowledge transfer (scientific authors talk about their research with
cultural agents) and reverse knowledge transfer (cultural agents give

do not transfer knowledge directly so often as non-academic scientists, but the
former engage into indirect and reverse transfer knowledge more often than the

using a three-stage experimental protocol including optical pumping and
measuring the difference of the nuclear spin polarization before and after a
dark interval of variable length. This method allows us to measure the
spin-lattice relaxation time $T_1$ of optically pumped nuclei ""in the dark"",
that is, in the absence of illumination. The measured $T_1$ values fall into
the sub-second time range, being three orders of magnitude shorter than in
earlier studied n-type GaAs. The drastic difference is further emphasized by
magnetic-field and temperature dependences of $T_1$ in p-GaAs, showing no
similarity to those in n-GaAs. This unexpected behavior is explained within a
developed theoretical model involving quadrupole relaxation of nuclear spins,
which is induced by electric fields within closely spaced donor-acceptor pairs.

internal and atmospheric sources of water appear to be insufficient to sustain
the observed slope activity. Experimental evidence suggests that under the low
atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars, gas can flow upwards through
porous Martian soil due to thermal creep under surface regions heated by the
Sun, and disturb small particles. Here we present numerical simulations to
demonstrate that such a dry process involving the pumping of rarefied gas in
the Martian soil due to temperature contrasts can explain the formation of the
recurring slope lineae. In our simulations, solar irradiation followed by
shadow significantly reduces the angle of repose due to the resulting temporary
temperature gradients over shaded terrain, and leads to flow at intermediate
slope angles. The simulated flow locations are consistent with observed
recurring slope lineae that initiate in rough and bouldered terrains with local
shadows over the soil. We suggest that this dry avalanche process can explain
the formation of the recurring slope lineae on Mars without requiring liquid
water or CO2 frost activity.

cadence. We evaluate the impact of the time-dependent acquisition of different
wavelengths on the inversion of spectropolarimetric profiles from chromospheric
lines during umbral flashes. Simulations of non-linear wave propagation in a
sunspot were performed with the code MANCHA. Synthetic Stokes parameters in the
Ca II 8542 A line in NLTE were computed for an umbral flash using the code
NICOLE. Artificial profiles with the same wavelength coverage and temporal
cadence from reported observations were constructed and inverted. The inferred
atmospheric stratifications were compared with the original models. The
inferred atmospheres provide a reasonable characterization of the thermodynamic
properties of the atmosphere during most of the phases of the umbral flash.
Only at the early stages of the flash, when the shock wave reaches the
formation height of the line, the Stokes profiles present apparent wavelength
shifts and other spurious deformations. These features are misinterpreted by
the inversion code, which can return unrealistic atmospheric models from a good
fit of the Stokes profiles. The misguided results include flashed atmospheres
with strong downflows, even though the simulation exhibits upflows during the
umbral flash, and large variations in the magnetic field strength. Our analyses
validate the inversion of Stokes profiles acquired by sequentially scanning
certain selected wavelengths of a line profile, even in the case of
rapidly-changing events such as umbral flashes. However, the inversions are
unreliable during a short period at the development phase of the flash.

study the effect of potential cometary impacts on the TRAPPIST-1 planets and
how they would affect the primordial atmospheres of these planets. We consider
both atmospheric mass loss and volatile delivery with a view to assessing
whether any sort of life has a chance to develop. We ran N-body simulations to
investigate the orbital evolution of potential impacting comets, to determine
which planets are more likely to be impacted and the distributions of impact
velocities. We consider three scenarios that could potentially throw comets
into the inner region (i.e within 0.1au where the seven planets are located)
from an (as yet undetected) outer belt similar to the Kuiper belt or an Oort
cloud: Planet scattering, the Kozai-Lidov mechanism and Galactic tides. For the
different scenarios, we quantify, for each planet, how much atmospheric mass is
lost and what mass of volatiles can be delivered over the age of the system
depending on the mass scattered out of the outer belt. We find that the
resulting high velocity impacts can easily destroy the primordial atmospheres
of all seven planets, even if the mass scattered from the outer belt is as low
as that of the Kuiper belt. However, we find that the atmospheres of the
outermost planets f, g and h can also easily be replenished with cometary
volatiles (e.g. $\sim$ an Earth ocean mass of water could be delivered). These
scenarios would thus imply that the atmospheres of these outermost planets
could be more massive than those of the innermost planets, and have
volatiles-enriched composition.

two-sided representation of the input matrix. The underlying proposed
optimization problem is non-convex, which assures a flexible pool of solutions.
Moreover, we prove that it can be solved with a near linear time complexity on

both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates ROCCO's properties in

mixed-gravitational anomaly cancellation could be of central importance in
constraining the fermion contents of a new chiral gauge theory. Such

condition $k_1\,X_1/2=k_2\,X_2$ with $X_i$ being a charge of $U(1)_{X_i}$ and
$k_i$ being an integer, both of which are flavor dependent. We show that
axionic domain-wall condition $N_{\rm DW}$ with the anomaly free-condition
depends on both $U(1)_X$ charged quark and lepton flavors; the seesaw scale
congruent to the scale of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breakdown can be constrained
through constraints coming from astrophysics and particle physics. Then the
model extended by $SL_2(F_3)\times U(1)_X$ symmetry can well be
flavor-structured in a unique way that $N_{\rm DW}=1$ with the $U(1)_X$

set of $F_N$ identical balls scattered into $N$ urns connected by an underlying
symmetrical graph with constant degree $h_N$. After some random amount of time
{\em all the balls} of any urn are redistributed locally, among the $h_N$ urns
of its neighborhood. The allocation of balls is done at random according to a
set of weights which depend on the state of the system. The main original
features of this context is that the cardinality $h_N$ of the range of
interaction is not necessarily linear with respect to $N$ as in a classical
mean-field context and, also, that the number of simultaneous jumps of the
process is not bounded due to the redistribution of all balls of an urn at the
same time. The approach relies on the analysis of the evolution of the local
empirical distributions associated to the state of urns located in the
neighborhood of a given urn. Under convenient conditions, by taking an
appropriate Wasserstein distance and by establishing several technical
estimates for local empirical distributions, we are able to prove mean-field
convergence results.
  When the load per node goes to infinity, a convergence result for the
invariant distribution of the associated McKean-Vlasov process is obtained for
several allocation policies. For the class of power of $d$ choices policies, we
show that the associated invariant measure has an asymptotic finite support
property under this regime. This result differs somewhat from the classical
double exponential decay property usually encountered in the literature for
power of $d$ choices policies.

composite-type supernova remnant (SNR) G21.5$-$0.9, whose emission is dominated
by the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) contribution. The X-ray spectra in the 0.8-80
keV range obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS), Soft X-ray Imager
(SXI) and Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) show a significant break in the continuum as
previously found with the NuSTAR observation. After taking into account all
known emissions from the SNR other than the PWN itself, we find that the Hitomi
spectra can be fitted with a broken power law with photon indices of
$\Gamma_1=1.74\pm0.02$ and $\Gamma_2=2.14\pm0.01$ below and above the break at
$7.1\pm0.3$ keV, which is significantly lower than the NuSTAR result ($\sim9.0$
keV). The spectral break cannot be reproduced by time-dependent particle
injection one-zone spectral energy distribution models, which strongly
indicates that a more complex emission model is needed, as suggested by recent
theoretical models. We also search for narrow emission or absorption lines with
the SXS, and perform a timing analysis of PSR J1833$-$1034 with the HXI and
SGD. No significant pulsation is found from the pulsar. However, unexpectedly,
narrow absorption line features are detected in the SXS data at 4.2345 keV and
9.296 keV with a significance of 3.65 $\sigma$. While the origin of these
features is not understood, their mere detection opens up a new field of
research and was only possible with the high resolution, sensitivity and
ability to measure extended sources provided by an X-ray microcalorimeter.

$\mu$ such that the characteristic function $\hat{\mu}$ has a
L\'{e}vy-Khintchine representation with characteristic triplet $(a,\gamma,
\nu)$, where $\nu$ is a L\'{e}vy measure, $\gamma\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a\ge 0$. A
natural extension of such distributions are quasi-infinitely distributions.
Instead of a L\'{e}vy measure, we assume that $\nu$ is a ""signed L\'{e}vy
measure"", for further information on the definition see [\ref{Lindner}]. We
show that a distribution $\mu=p\delta_{x_0}+(1-p)\mu_{ac}$ with $p>0$ and $x_0
\in \mathbb{R}$, where $\mu_{ac}$ is the absolutely continuous part, is
quasi-infinitely divisible if and only if $\hat{\mu}(z)\neq0$ for every
$z\in\mathbb{R}$. We apply this to show that certain variance mixtures of mean
zero normal distributions are quasi-infinitely divisible distributions, and we
give an example of a quasi-infinitely divisible distribution that is not
continuous but has infinite quasi-L\'{e}vy measure. Furthermore, it is shown
that replacing the signed L\'{e}vy measure by a seemingly more general complex
L\'{e}vy measure does not lead to new distributions. Last but not least it is
proven that the class of quasi-infinitely divisible distributions is not open,

  with Budgeted Uncertainty",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider robust combinatorial optimization problems where the decision
maker can react to a scenario by choosing from a finite set of $k$ solutions.
This approach is appropriate for decision problems under uncertainty where the
implementation of decisions requires preparing the ground. We focus on the case
that the set of possible scenarios is described through a budgeted uncertainty
set and provide three algorithms for the problem. The first algorithm solves
heuristically the dualized problem, a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear
program (MINLP), via an alternating optimization approach. The second algorithm
solves the MINLP exactly for $k=2$ through a dedicated spatial branch-and-bound
algorithm. The third approach enumerates $k$-tuples, relying on strong bounds
to avoid a complete enumeration. We test our methods on shortest path instances
that were used in the previous literature and on randomly generated knapsack
instances, and find that our methods considerably outperform previous
approaches. Many instances that were previously not solved within hours can now
be solved within few minutes, often even faster.

500$\arcsec$ ($\sim$20 parsec) of the Galactic Center (GC), where the {\it
nuclear star cluster} (NSC) stands, based on a total of $\sim$4.5 Ms of {\it
Chandra} observations taken from September 1999 to April 2013. This ultra-deep
dataset offers unprecedented sensitivity for detecting X-ray sources in the GC,
down to an intrinsic 2--10 keV luminosity of
$1.0\times10^{31}{\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$. A total of 3619 sources are detected in the
2--8 keV band, among which $\sim$3500 are probable GC sources and $\sim$1300
are new identifications. The GC sources collectively account for $\sim$20\% of
the total 2--8 keV flux from the inner 250$\arcsec$ region where detection
sensitivity is the greatest. Taking advantage of this unprecedented sample of
faint X-ray sources that primarily traces the old stellar populations in the
NSC, we revisit global source properties, including long-term variability,
cumulative spectra, luminosity function and spatial distribution. Based on the
equivalent width and relative strength of the iron lines, we suggest that in
addition to the arguably predominant population of magnetic cataclysmic
variables (CVs), non-magnetic CVs contribute substantially to the detected
sources, especially in the lower-luminosity group. On the other hand, the X-ray
sources have a radial distribution closely following the stellar mass
distribution in the NSC, but much flatter than that of the known X-ray
transients, which are presumably low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) caught in
outburst. This, together with the very modest long-term variability of the
detected sources, strongly suggests that quiescent LMXBs are a minor
($\lesssim$ a few percent) population.

inter-cellular bands of dense and aligned fibers, through which they
mechanically interact over long distances. Such matrix-mediated cellular
interactions have been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes. The
current study was aimed at exploring the effects of elastic nonlinearity of the
fibers contained in the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the transmission of
mechanical loads between contracting cells. Based on our biological
experiments, we developed a finite-element model of two contracting cells
embedded within a fibrous network. The individual fibers were modeled as
showing either linear elasticity, compression-microbuckling, tension-stiffening
or both of the latter. Compression-buckling resulted in smaller loads occurring
in the ECM, but these were more directed toward the neighboring cell. The
latter decreased with increasing cell-to-cell distance; when cells were >15
cell-diameters apart, no such inter-cellular interaction was observed.
Tension-stiffening further contributed to directing the loads toward the
neighboring cell, though to a smaller extent. The contraction of two
neighboring cells resulted in mutual attraction forces, which were considerably
increased by tension-stiffening, and decayed with increasing cell-to-cell
distances. Nonlinear elasticity contributed also to the onset of force polarity
on the cell boundary. The density and alignment of the fibers within the
inter-cellular band were considerably greater when fibers buckled under
compression, with tension-stiffening further contributing to this structural
remodeling. Our model demonstrates the contribution of nonlinear elasticity of
biological gels to directionality and efficiency of mechanical-signal transfer
between distant cells.

proton kinematics, and their correlations in charged-current pionless neutrino
interactions, measured by the T2K ND280 near detector in its plastic
scintillator (C$_8$H$_8$) target. The data were taken between years 2010 and
2013, corresponding to approximately 6$\times10^{20}$ protons on target. Thanks
to their exploration of the proton kinematics and of kinematic imbalances
between the proton and muon kinematics, the results offer a novel probe of the
nuclear-medium effects most pertinent to the (sub-)GeV neutrino-nucleus
interactions that are used in accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino
oscillation measurements. These results are compared to many neutrino-nucleus
interaction models which all fail to describe at least part of the observed
phase space. In case of events without a proton above a detection threshold in
the final state, a fully consistent implementation of the local Fermi gas model
with multinucleon interactions gives the best description of the data. In the
case of at least one proton in the final state the spectral function model
agrees well with the data, most notably when measuring the kinematic imbalance
between the muon and the proton in the plane transverse to the incoming
neutrino. A clear indication of existence of multinucleon interactions is
observed. The effect of final-state interactions is also discussed.

It offers a deterministic message transmission in the static segment following
a time-triggered schedule. Even if its bandwidth is ten times higher than the
bandwidth of CAN, its throughput limits are going to be reached in high-class
car models soon. A solution that could postpone this problem is to use an
efficient scheduling algorithm that exploits both channels of the FlexRay. The
significant and often neglected feature that can theoretically double the
bandwidth is the possibility to use two independent communication channels that
can intercommunicate through the gateway.
  In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm that decomposes the
scheduling problem to the ECU-to-channel assignment subproblem which decides
which channel the ECUs (Electronic Control Units) should be connected to and
the channel scheduling subproblem which creates static segment communication
schedules for both channels. The algorithm is able to create a schedule for
cases where channels are configured in the independent mode as well as in the
fault-tolerant mode or in cases where just part of the signals are
fault-tolerant. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated on real data and
synthesized data, and the relation between the portion of fault-tolerant
signals and the number of allocated slots is presented.

properties of emitted photons, such as energy and angular distribution as well
as polarization, is regarded as a powerful tool for gaining more insight into
the physics of corresponding processes. Another characteristic of light is the
projection of its angular momentum upon propagation direction. This property
has attracted a special attention over the last decades due to studies of
twisted (or vortex) light beams. Measurements being sensitive to this
projection may provide valuable information about the role of angular momentum
in the fundamental atomic processes. Here we describe a simple theoretical
method for determination of the angular momentum properties of the photons
emitted in various atomic processes. This method is based on the evaluation of
expectation value of the total angular momentum projection operator. To
illustrate the method, we apply it to the text-book examples of plane-wave,
spherical-wave, and Bessel light. Moreover, we investigate the projection of
angular momentum for the photons emitted in the process of the radiative
recombination with ionic targets. It is found that the recombination photons do
carry a non-zero projection of the orbital angular momentum.

They resort to, respectively, spontaneous restoration of non-Hermitian

either a conserved power, quadratic power increase, or even quartic power
increase, depending on whether the localized eigenstate or one of the two

dark energy models ,include PL , CPL and FSL, with most recent cosmological
data and investigate their implication for structure formation, dark energy
clustering and abundance of CMB local peaks. From the joint analysis of the CMB
temperature power spectrum from observation of the Planck, SNIa light-curve,
baryon acoustic oscillation, $f\sigma_8$ for large scale structure observations
and the Hubble parameter, the PL model has the highest growth of matter
density, $ \Delta_{m} $, and matter power spectrum, $ P(k) $, compared to
$\Lambda$CDM and other models. For the CPL on the other hand, the structure
formation is considerably suppressed while the FSL has behavior similar to
standard model of cosmology. Studying the clustering of dark energy, $
\Delta_{DE}$, yields positive but small value with maximum of $
\Delta_{DE}\simeq10^{-3} $ at early time due to matter behaviour of the PL,
while for the CPL and FSL cross $ \Delta_{DE}=0 $ several time which
demonstrate void of dark energy with $ \Delta_{DE}\simeq-10^{-11} $ in certain
periods of the history of dark energy evolution. Among these three models, the
PL model demonstrate that is more compatible with $ f\sigma_{8} $ data. We also
investigated a certain geometrical measure, namely the abundance of local
maxima as a function of threshold for three DDE models and find that the method
is potentially capable to discriminate between the models, especially far from
mean threshold. The contribution of PL and CPL for late ISW are significant
compared to cosmological constant and FSL model. The tension in the Hubble
parameters is almost alleviated in the PL model.

properties of umbral dots with the large-scale properties of sunspots. For this
purpose, we analyze high-resolution G-band images of 42 sunspots observed by
{\em Hinode}/SOT, located close to disk center. The images were corrected for
instrumental stray-light and restored with the modeled PSF. An automated
multi-level tracking algorithm was employed to identify the UDs located in
selected G-band images. Furthermore, we employed HMI/SDO, limb-darkening
corrected, full disk continuum images to estimate the sunspot phase and epoch
for the selected sunspots. The number of UDs identified in different umbrae
exhibits a linear relation with the umbral size. The observed filling factor
ranges from 3\% to 7\% and increases with the mean umbral intensity. Moreover,
the filling factor shows a decreasing trend with the umbral size. We also found
that the observed mean and maximum intensities of UDs are correlated with the
mean umbral intensity. However, we do not find any significant relationship
between the mean (and maximum) intensity and effective diameter of umbral dots
with the sunspot area, epoch, and decay rate. We suggest that this lack of
relation could either be due to the distinct transition of spatial scales
associated with overturning convection in the umbra or the shallow depth
associated with umbral dots, or both the above.

promising targets for ground-based detectors such as Advanced Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the proposed Einstein

GW propagation. We perform a thorough calculation of the lensing rate, by
taking account of effects caused by the ellipticity of lensing galaxies, lens
environments, and magnification bias. We find that in certain GW source rate
scenarios, we should be able to observe strongly lensed GW events once per year
($\sim1~\text{yr}^{-1}$) in the aLIGO survey at its design sensitivity; for the
proposed ET survey, the rate could be as high as $\sim80~\text{yr}^{-1}$. These
results depend on the estimate of GW source abundance, and hence can be
correspondingly modified with an improvement in our understanding of the merger
rate of stellar binary black holes. We also compute the fraction of four-image
lens systems in each survey, predicting it to be $\sim30$ per cent for the
aLIGO survey and $\sim6$ per cent for the ET survey. Finally, we evaluate the
possibility of missing some images due to the finite survey duration, by
presenting the probability distribution of lensing time delays. We predict that
this selection bias will be insignificant in future GW surveys, as most of the
lens systems ($\sim90$ per cent) will have time delays less than $\sim1$ month,
which will be far shorter than survey durations.

subject to constraints on the UAV's maximum speed, initial/final locations, and

However, the joint trajectory and power optimization problem is non-convex and

efficient algorithm that ensures to obtain a locally optimal solution by
applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex

stochastic objectives in stochastic computation graphs (SCG), eg, in

gradient estimators by differentiating a surrogate loss (SL) objective is
computationally and conceptually simple, using the same approach for
higher-order derivatives is more challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving
and implementing such estimators is laborious and not compliant with automatic
differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL to construct new objectives
for each order derivative involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations.
Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under differentiation, SL treats part
of the cost as a fixed sample, which we show leads to missing and wrong terms
for estimators of higher-order derivatives. To address all these shortcomings
in a unified way, we introduce DiCE, which provides a single objective that can
be differentiated repeatedly, generating correct estimators of derivatives of
any order in SCGs. Unlike SL, DiCE relies on automatic differentiation for
performing the requisite graph manipulations. We verify the correctness of DiCE

fast rising MIR LCs. They consist of 61% sample of the WISE MIR variable

After rejecting 5 plausible obscured Seyfert galaxies with red MIR colours,
remaining 14 objects are studied in detail in this paper. We fit the declining
part of LC with an exponential law, and the decay time is typically one year.
The observed peak MIR luminosities ($\nu L_\nu$) after subtracting host
galaxies are in the range of a few 10^42 to 10^44 erg~s^-1 with a median of
5x10^43 erg~s^-1 in the W2 band. The black hole masses distribute in a wide

different from that of optical/UV selected TDEs. Furthermore, MIR luminosities
are correlated with black hole masses, the stellar mass or luminosity of their
host bulges. Most galaxies in the sample are red and luminous with an absolute
magnitude of r between -20 to -23. We estimate the rate of event about 10^-4

hydrogen/air flames freely propagating in a planar narrow channel with varying
flow rate, using detailed chemistry and transport and including heat losses
through the channel walls. Our simulations show that double solutions,
symmetric and non symmetric, can coexist for a given set of parameters. The
symmetric solutions are calculated imposing symmetric boundary conditions in
the channel mid plane and when this restriction is relaxed non symmetric
solutions can develop. This indicates that the symmetric solutions are unstable
to non symmetric perturbations, as predicted before within the context of a
thermo diffusive model and simplified chemistry. It is also found that for lean
hydrogen/air mixtures an increase in heat losses leads to a discontinuity of
the steady state response curve, with flames extinguishing inside a finite
interval of the flow rate. Non symmetric flames burn more intensely and in
consequence are much more robust to flame quenching by heat losses to the
walls. The inclusion of the non symmetric solutions extends therefore the
parametric range for which flames can propagate in the channel. This analysis
seems to have received no attention in the literature, even if it can have
important safety implications in micro scale combustion devices burning
hydrogen in a lean premixed way.

reduced by $E_z$, but enhanced by $B_z$, in which the threshold channel might
dramatically change in the formed case. The above-mentioned characteristics are
in sharp contrast with those of layered graphenes.

detection of the cosmic maser emission. For the first time, cosmic water maser
emission was detected with projected baselines exceeding Earth Diameter. It was
detected in a number of star-forming regions in the Galaxy and megamaser
galaxies NGC 4258 and NGC 3079. RadioAstron observations provided the absolute
record of the angular resolution in astronomy. Fringes from the NGC 4258
megamaser were detected on baseline exceeding 25 Earth Diameters. This means
that the angular resolution sufficient to measure the parallax of the water
maser source in the nearby galaxy LMC was directly achieved in the cosmic maser
observations. Very compact features with angular sizes about 20 microarcsec
have been detected in star-forming regions of our Galaxy. Corresponding linear
sizes are about 5-10 million kilometers. So, the major step from milli- to
micro-arcsecond resolution in maser studies is done in the RadioAstron mission.
The existence of the features with extremely small angular sizes is
established. Further implementations of the space-VLBI maser instrument for
studies of the nature of cosmic objects, studies of the interaction of

extension of the enhanced velocity mixed finite element (EVMFE) [Wheeler et.

different space-time discretizations on non-overlapping, subdomains by
enforcing a mass continuity argument at the non-matching interface to preserve
the local mass conservation property inherent to the mixed finite element
methods. To this effect, we consider three different model formulations: (1) a
linear single phase flow problem, (2) a non-linear slightly compressible flow
and tracer transport, and (3) a non-linear slightly compressible, multiphase
flow and transport. We also present a numerical solution algorithm for the
proposed domain decomposition approach where a monolithic (fully coupled in
space and time) system is constructed that does not require subdomain
iterations. This space-time EVMFE method accurately resolves
advection-diffusion transport features, in a heterogeneous medium, while
circumventing non-linear solver convergence issues associated with large
time-step sizes for non-linear problems. Numerical results are presented for
the aforementioned, three, model formulations to demonstrate the applicability
of this approach to a general class of problems in flow and transport in porous

internally. This paradigm has recently been challenged for short time scales,
where interbank markets seem better characterised by a bipartite structure with
more core-periphery connections than inside the core. Using a novel
core-periphery detection method on the eMID interbank market, we enrich this
picture by showing that the network is actually characterised by multiple
core-periphery pairs. Moreover, a transition from core-periphery to bipartite
structures occurs by shortening the temporal scale of data aggregation. We
further show how the global financial crisis transformed the market, in terms
of composition, multiplicity and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs.

ideal for rotation-curve analysis, these new results, taken at face value, have
interesting ramifications for MOND. The methods employed afford a direct
determination of the stellar mass in the disc, which, in turn, affords a
parameter-free MOND prediction of the rotation curve, which I show. In
comparison, the dark-matter fits that Aniyan et al. present have two free
parameters. To boot, these results further negate an earlier claim deleterious
to MOND. It is that stellar $M/L$ ratios deduced from vertical velocity
dispersions in disc galaxies are rather lower than what is required by MOND
fits to rotation curves. Specifically, it was claimed that even
high-surface-density discs are, by and large, sub maximal; viz., that they show
substantial mass discrepancies near their center. This is contrary to the
prediction of MOND that in such high-acceleration regions only small
discrepancies should appear, if any to speak of. Such claims of low $M/L$

In many situations, due to imperfect information communication among nodes, the
performance of traditional diffusion adaptive algorithms such as the diffusion
LMS (DLMS) may degrade. To deal with this problem, several modified DLMS
algorithms have been proposed. However, these DLMS based algorithms still
suffer from biased estimation and are not robust to impulsive link noise. In
this paper, we focus on improving the performance of diffusion adaptation with
noisy links from two aspects: accuracy and robustness. A new algorithm called
diffusion maximum total correntropy (DMTC) is proposed. The new algorithm is
theoretically unbiased in Gaussian noise, and can efficiently handle the link
noises in the presence of large outliers. The adaptive combination rule is
applied to further improve the performance. The stability analysis of the
proposed algorithm is given. Simulation results show that the DMTC algorithm
can achieve good performance in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise
environments.

securely execute RAM programs over data that is stored in an untrusted server.
Distributed Oblivious RAM is a variant of ORAM, where the data is stored in
$m>1$ servers. Extensive research over the last few decades have succeeded to
reduce the bandwidth overhead of ORAM schemes, both in the single-server and
the multi-server setting, from $O(\sqrt{N})$ to $O(1)$. However, all known
protocols that achieve a sub-logarithmic overhead either require heavy
server-side computation (e.g. homomorphic encryption), or a large block size of
at least $\Omega(\log^3 N)$.
  In this paper, we present a family of distributed ORAM constructions that
follow the hierarchical approach of Goldreich and Ostrovsky [GO96]. We enhance
known techniques, and develop new ones, to take better advantage of the
existence of multiple servers. By plugging efficient known hashing schemes in
our constructions, we get the following results:
  1. For any $m\geq 2$, we show an $m$-server ORAM scheme with $O(\log
N/\log\log N)$ overhead, and block size $\Omega(\log^2 N)$. This scheme is
private even against an $(m-1)$-server collusion. 2. A 3-server ORAM
construction with $O(\omega(1)\log N/\log\log N)$ overhead and a block size
almost logarithmic, i.e. $\Omega(\log^{1+\epsilon}N)$.
  We also investigate a model where the servers are allowed to perform a linear
amount of light local computations, and show that constant overhead is
achievable in this model, through a simple four-server ORAM protocol.

wave systems with a hybrid precoding architecture at the base-station. To
enable multi-user transmissions, the base-station uses a cell-specific codebook
of beamforming vectors over an initial beam alignment phase. Each user uses a
user-specific codebook of beamforming vectors to learn the top-P (where P >= 1)
beam pairs in terms of the observed SNR in a single-user setting. The top-P
beam indices along with their SNRs are fed back from each user and the
base-station leverages this information to generate beam weights for
simultaneous transmissions. A typical method to generate the beam weights is to
use only the best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam,
or to utilize this information to reduce multi-user interference. The other
beams are used as fall back options to address blockage or mobility. Such an
approach completely discards information learned about the channel condition(s)
even though each user feeds back this information. With this background, this
work develops an advanced directional precoding structure for simultaneous
transmissions at the cost of an additional marginal feedback overhead. This
construction relies on three main innovations: 1) Additional feedback to allow
the base-station to reconstruct a rank-P approximation of the channel matrix
between it and each user, 2) A zeroforcing structure that leverages this
information to combat multi-user interference by remaining agnostic of the
receiver beam knowledge in the precoder design, and 3) A hybrid precoding
architecture that allows both amplitude and phase control at low-complexity and
cost to allow the implementation of the zeroforcing structure. Numerical
studies show that the proposed scheme results in a significant sum rate
performance improvement over naive schemes even with a coarse initial beam
alignment codebook.

for territory. In this model, agents represent gang members and move according
to a biased random walk, adding graffiti with some probability as they move and
preferentially avoiding the other gang's graffiti. All agent interactions are
indirect, with the interactions occurring through the graffiti field. We show
numerically that as parameters vary, a phase transition occurs between a
well-mixed state and a well-segregated state. The numerical results show that
system mass, decay rate and graffiti rate influence the critical parameter.
From the discrete model, we derive a continuum system of convection-diffusion
equations for territorial development. Using the continuum equations, we
perform a linear stability analysis to determine the stability of the
equilibrium solutions and we find that we can determine the precise location of
the phase transition in parameter space as a function of the system mass and
the graffiti creation and decay rates.

heating rate of the interaction shock. We use the resulting shock heating rates
to derive approximate bolometric light curves, and provide analytic formulas
that can be used to generate simple synthetic light curves for general
supernova-disk interactions. For certain disk parameters and explosion
energies, we are able to produce luminosities akin to those seen in
super-luminous SN. Because the SN ejecta can flow around and engulf the CSM
disk, the interaction region may become embedded and from certain viewing
angles the narrow emission lines indicative of interaction may be hidden.

theory, solving the integral Bethe-Salpeter equation and applying the memory

$1/\tau_{\perp} \propto T^3$ if the Fermi energy, $E_F$ lies below the critical
value, $E_F < 3 \omega_{\perp}/4$. Otherwise, unless the system is close to
integrability, the rate $1/\tau_{\perp}$ has the temperature dependence similar

three-form fields in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. We start by carrying
out the Hamiltonian formalism of this cosmological model. We then apply this
formalism to a Little Sibling of the Big Rip (LSBR), an abrupt event milder
than a Big Rip and that is known to be generic to several minimally coupled
three-form fields for a variety of potentials. We obtain a set of analytical
solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation using different analytical
approximations and explore the physical consequences of them. It turns out that
there are quantum states where the wave function of the universe vanishes, i.e.
the DeWitt condition is fulfilled for them. Given that this happens only for
some subset of solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, this points out that
the matter inducing the LSBR is equally important in the process as, it has
been previously shown, a minimally coupled phantom scalar field feeding
classically a LSBR is smoothed at the quantum level, i.e. all the quantum
states lead to a vanishing wave function.

nanostructures at the metal fluid interface. First, we experimentally show how
three and four spot evanescent wave excitation can lead to unconventional
assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles at the metal fluid interface. We observed
that the pattern of assembly was mainly governed by the plasmon interference
pattern at the metal fluid interface, and further led to interesting dynamic
effects within the assembly. The interference patterns were corroborated by 3D
finite difference time domain simulations. Secondly, we show how anisotropic
geometry, such as Ag nanowires, can be assembled and aligned in unstructured
and structured plasmofluidic fields. We found that by structuring the
metal-film, Ag nanowires can be aligned at the metal fluid interface with a
single evanescent wave excitation, thus highlighting the prospect of assembling
plasmonic circuits in a fluid. An interesting aspect of our method is that we
obtain the assembly at locations away from the excitation points, thus leading
to remote assembly of nanostructures. The results discussed herein may have
implications in realizing a platform for reconfigurable plasmonic
metamaterials, and a test-bed to understand the effect of plasmon interference
on assembly of nanostructures in fluids.

Internet clients. First, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art
delay-based geolocation techniques are susceptible to evasion through delay
manipulations, which involve both increasing and decreasing the Internet delays
that are observed between a client and a remote measuring party. We then
propose Client Presence Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify
an assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic
region. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted
location are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between
themselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays
and thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between
each verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance
inference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise
a novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and
the three verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client
could manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process. We
evaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments with legitimate clients
(those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired
and wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab
testbed, during which we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy, such
as the client's geographical nearness to the verifiers. For wireless
evaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired
clients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile
wireless link. Finally, we reinforce CPV against a (hypothetical) middlebox
that an adversary specifically customizes to defeat CPV.

splitting the unicast message into common and private parts and encoding the
common parts along with the multicast message into a super-common stream

size, number of filters, and pooling size, which require manual tuning. Though
deep stacked structures are able to create multi-scale and hierarchical
representations, manually fixed filter sizes limit the scale of representations
that can be learned in a single convolutional layer.
  This paper introduces a new adaptive filter model that allows variable scale
and orientation. The scale and orientation parameters of filters can be learned
using back propagation. Therefore, in a single convolution layer, we can create
filters of different scale and orientation that can adapt to small or large
features and objects. The proposed model uses a relatively large base size
(grid) for filters. In the grid, a differentiable function acts as an envelope
for the filters. The envelope function guides effective filter scale and
shape/orientation by masking the filter weights before the convolution.
Therefore, only the weights in the envelope are updated during training.
  In this work, we employed a multivariate (2D) Gaussian as the envelope
function and showed that it can grow, shrink, or rotate by updating its
covariance matrix during back propagation training . We tested the new filter
model on MNIST, MNIST-cluttered, and CIFAR-10 and compared the results with the
networks that used conventional convolution layers. The results demonstrate
that the new model can effectively learn and produce filters of different
scales and orientations in a single layer. Moreover, the experiments show that
the adaptive convolution layers perform equally; or better, especially when
data includes objects of varying scale and noisy backgrounds.

mechanism, and devise three graphical displays to show the visible functional
aspect of epileptic mechanism over five inter-ictal periods. The foundation of
our data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal

each pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular
fashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the
oscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend. Such dynamic patterns are
collectively transformed into a visible systemic change-point as an early
