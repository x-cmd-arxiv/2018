two evidence sources, or subjective opinions from multiple actors. For
subjective logic, a number of different fusion operators have been proposed,
each matching a fusion scenario with different assumptions. However, not all of
these operators are associative, and therefore multi-source fusion is not
well-defined for these settings. In this paper, we address this challenge, and
define multi-source fusion for weighted belief fusion (WBF) and consensus &
compromise fusion (CCF). For WBF, we show the definition to be equivalent to
the intuitive formulation under the bijective mapping between subjective logic
and Dirichlet evidence PDFs. For CCF, since there is no independent
generalization, we show that the resulting multi-source fusion produces valid
opinions, and explain why our generalization is sound. For completeness, we
also provide corrections to previous results for averaging and cumulative
belief fusion (ABF and CBF), as well as belief constraint fusion (BCF), which
is an extension of Dempster's rule. With our generalizations of fusion
operators, fusing information from multiple sources is now well-defined for all
different fusion types defined in subjective logic. This enables wider
applicability of subjective logic in applications where multiple actors
interact.

features. These include: (i) Equal-order interpolation for all the field
variables (which is computationally the most convenient) is stable under the
proposed formulation. (ii) The stabilization terms are residual-based, and the
stabilization parameters do not contain any mesh-dependent parameters. (iii)
The formulation is theoretically shown to be consistent, stable, and hence
convergent. (iv) The formulation supports non-conforming discretizations and
distorted meshes. (v) The DG formulation has improved element-wise (local) mass
balance compared to the corresponding continuous formulation. (vi) The proposed

the difference $\varphi^* \omega_2 - \omega_1$ is $\epsilon$-small with respect

another embedding, then the limit is $E$-symplectic, where the number $E$
depends only on $\epsilon$ and $E (\epsilon) \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$. This
generalizes $C^0$-rigidity of symplectic embeddings, and answers a question in
topological quantum computing by Michael Freedman. As in the symplectic case,
this rigidity theorem can be deduced from the existence and properties of
symplectic capacities. An $\epsilon$-symplectic embedding preserves capacity up
to an $\epsilon$-small error, and linear $\epsilon$-symplectic maps can be
characterized by the property that they preserve the symplectic spectrum of
ellipsoids (centered at the origin) up to an error that is $\epsilon$-small. We
sketch an alternative proof using the shape invariant, which gives rise to an
analogous characterization and rigidity theorem for $\epsilon$-contact

the other one, and in a third model, the additional influence of a continuous

chirality of magnetic defects are found to play important roles in determining

a non-negligible probability for species differentiation to occur.

its dark matter halo using globular clusters as tracers. At the same time, we
constrain the phase-space distribution of the globular cluster system. We use
the Gaia DR2 catalogue of 75 globular clusters' proper motions and recent
measurements of the proper motions of another 20 distant clusters obtained with
the Hubble Space Telescope. We describe the globular cluster system with a
2-component distribution function (DF), with a flat, rotating disc and a
rounder, more extended halo. While fixing the Milky Way's disc and bulge, we
let the mass and shape of the dark matter halo and we fit these two parameters,
together with other six describing the DF, with a Bayesian method. We find the
mass of the Galaxy within 20 kpc to be $M(<20{\,\rm kpc})=1.91^{+0.18}_{-0.17}
\times 10^{11} M_\odot$, of which $M_{\rm DM}(<20{\,\rm
kpc})=1.37^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\times 10^{11}M_\odot$ is in dark matter, and the
density axis ratio of the dark matter halo to be $q=1.30 \pm 0.25$. This
implies a virial mass $M_{\rm via} = 1.3 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Our
analysis rules out oblate ($q<0.8$) and strongly prolate halos ($q>1.9$) with
99\% probability. Our preferred model reproduces well the observed phase-space
distribution of globular clusters and has a disc component that closely
resembles that of the Galactic thick disc. The halo component follows a
power-law density profile $\rho \propto r^{-3.3}$, has a mean rotational
velocity of $V_{\rm rot}\simeq -14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ at 20 kpc, and has a mildly
radially biased velocity distribution ($\beta\simeq 0.2 \pm 0.07$, fairly
constant outside 15 kpc). We also find that our distinction between disc and
halo clusters resembles, although not fully, the observed distinction in
metal-rich ([Fe/H]$>-0.8$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq-0.8$) cluster
populations.

allows for asymmetric features. Two different asymmetries are created: (1) SPP

observed below an altitude of 300-km, is at least partly attributed to the
benzene (C$_6$H$_6$) ice $\nu_{4}$ C-H bending mode. While we first observed it
in CIRS nadir spectra of the southern polar region in early 2013, we focus here
on the study of nadir data acquired in May 2013, which have a more favorable
observation geometry. We derived the C$_6$H$_6$ ice mass mixing ratio in
5{\deg}S latitude bins from the south pole to 65{\deg}S and infer the
C$_6$H$_6$ cloud top altitude to be located deeper with increasing distance
from the pole. We additionally analyzed limb data acquired in March 2015, which
were the first limb dataset available after the May 2013 nadir observation, in
order to infer a vertical profile of its mass mixing ratio in the 0.1 - 1 mbar
region (250 - 170 km). We derive an upper limit of $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m for the
equivalent radius of pure C$_6$H$_6$ ice particles from the shape of the
observed emission band. Several other unidentified signatures are observed near
687 and 702 cm$^{-1}$ and possibly 695 cm$^{-1}$, which could also be due to
ice spectral signatures as they are observed in the deep stratosphere at
pressure levels similar to the C$_6$H$_6$ ice ones. We could not reproduce
these signatures with pure nitrile ice (HCN, HC$_3$N,CH$_3$CN, C$_2$H$_5$CN and

We prove it is NP-hard and APX-hard even if a generalized version of the

Measures like Cosine, Jaccard and Dice compute the similarities restricted to

properties beyond the locality. Others measures, such as the generalized edge
clustering coefficient, go beyond the locality but with high computational
complexity, making them impractical in large-scale scenarios. In this paper we
propose a novel similarity measure that determines the structural similarity by
dynamically diffusing and capturing information beyond the locality. This new
similarity is modeled as an iterated function that can be solved by fixed point
iteration in super-linear time and memory complexity, so it is able to analyze
large-scale graphs. In order to show the advantages of the proposed similarity

retained on flakes with lateral size of a few tens of nanometres, and with
thickness as small as ~ 2 nm, confirming the high crystalline quality and low
defects density in the FLG basal plane. Surface exposed step edges exhibit the
highest friction values, representing preferential sites for originating
secondary dissipative processes related to edge straining, wear or lateral

studies on graphene friction to the single-flake level. The capability to

the Hellinger modulus of continuity if the original data $X_1,\dots, X_n$ are

by a temperature independent (average) value of the speed of sound. Observables
like the rapidity density and the pseudorapidity density are evaluated
analytically, resulting in simple and easy to fit formulae that can be matched

selected with one isolated muon or electron and at least four jets from data

mass is reconstructed from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a
$\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ hypothesis. Using the ideogram method, the top quark
mass is determined simultaneously with an overall jet energy scale factor
(JSF), constrained by the mass of the W boson in $\mathrm{q\overline{q}'}$
decays. The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading
order matched to a leading-order parton shower. The top quark mass is found to
be 172.25 $\pm$ 0.08 (stat+JSF) $\pm$ 0.62 (syst) GeV. The dependence of this

modifies the input data such that humans still assign the same label, however,
machine learning models misclassify it. Previous approaches in the literature
demonstrated that adversarial examples can even be generated for the remotely
hosted model. In this paper, we propose a Siamese network based approach to
generate adversarial examples for a multiclass target CNN. We assume that the
adversary do not possess any knowledge of the target data distribution, and we
use an unlabeled mismatched dataset to query the target, e.g., for the
ResNet-50 target, we use the Food-101 dataset as the query. Initially, the
target model assigns labels to the query dataset, and a Siamese network is
trained on the image pairs derived from these multiclass labels. We learn the
\emph{adversarial perturbations} for the Siamese model and show that these
perturbations are also adversarial w.r.t. the target model. In experimental
results, we demonstrate effectiveness of our approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and

angular size of the different line-emitting regions. A simple LTE model was
created to constrain the physical conditions of HI emitting region. The
continuum region cannot be reproduced by a geometrical 2D elongated Gaussian
fitting model. We estimate the size of the region to be 1 au. We find the
Br$\gamma$ and Pfund lines come from a more compact region of size 0.4 au. The
Br$\gamma$ line exhibits an S-shaped differential phase, indicative of
rotation. The continuum and Br$\gamma$ line closure phase show offsets of
$\sim$-25$\pm$5 $^o$ and 20$\pm$10$^o$, respectively. This is evidence of an
asymmetry in their origin, but with opposing directions. We find that we cannot
converge on constraints for the HI physical parameters without a more detailed

reproduce the interferometric observables within the Br$\gamma$, line.

range of applications, from lab-on-a-chip devices to field-scale oil recovery.
It has long been known that effective wetting properties can be altered by the
application of an electric field; a phenomenon coined as electrowetting. Here,
we consider theoretically and numerically a single droplet sitting on an
(insulated) conductor, i.e., within a capacitor. The droplet consists of a pure
phase without solutes, while the surrounding fluid contains a symmetric
monovalent electrolyte, and the interface between them is impermeable. Using
nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann theory, we present a theoretical prediction of the
dependency of the apparent contact angle on the applied electric potential. We
then present well-resolved dynamic simulations of electrowetting using a
phase-field model, where the entire two-phase electrokinetic problem, including
the electric double layers (EDLs), is resolved. The simulations show that,
while the contact angle on scales smaller than the EDL is unaffected by the
application of an electric field, an apparent contact angle forms on scales
beyond the EDL. This contact angle relaxes in time towards a saturated apparent
contact angle. The dependency of the contact angle upon applied electric
potential is in good compliance with the theoretical prediction. The only
phenomenological parameter in the prediction is shown to only depend on the
permeability ratio between the two phases. Based on the resulting unified
description, we obtain an effective expression of the contact angle which can
be used in more macroscopic numerical simulations, i.e. where the
electrokinetic problem is not fully resolved.

spin-spin correlations in the paramagnetic state below about 50 K, revealed by
magnetic diffuse scattering. The sinusoidal spin-density wave with spins along
the a-direction sets in at 13 K, followed by the cycloidal configuration with
spins lying in the (ac) plane below 11.6 K. Microscopically, the strongest
magnetic coupling runs along the structural chains, J1 ' 12 K, which is likely
related to the one-dimensional spin-spin correlations. The interchain couplings
J2 ' 3:8K and J3 ' 2:1K are energetically well balanced and compete, thus
giving rise to the incommensurate order in sharp contrast to other
transition-metal pyroxenes, where one type of the interchain couplings
prevails. The magnetic model of NaFeGe2O6 is further completed by the weak
single-ion anisotropy along the a-direction. Our results resolve the earlier
controversies regarding the magnetic order in NaFeGe2O6 and establish relevant

well-approximated using Boolean networks. The average sensitivity is a natural
measure of stability in these systems: values below one indicate typically
stable dynamics associated with an ordered phase, whereas values above one
indicate chaotic dynamics. This yields a theoretically motivated adaptive
advantage to being near the critical value of one, at the boundary between
order and chaos. Here, we measure average sensitivity for 66 publicly available
Boolean network models describing the function of gene regulatory circuits
across diverse living processes. We find the average sensitivity values for
these networks are clustered around unity, indicating they are near critical.
In many types of random networks, mean connectivity <K> and the average
activity bias of the logic functions <p> have been found to be the most
important network properties in determining average sensitivity, and by
extension a network's criticality. Surprisingly, many of these gene regulatory
networks achieve the near-critical state with <K> and <p> far from that
predicted for critical systems: randomized networks sharing the local causal
structure and local logic of biological networks better reproduce their
critical behavior than controlling for macroscale properties such as <K> and
<p> alone. This suggests the local properties of genes interacting within
regulatory networks are selected to collectively be near-critical, and this
non-local property of gene regulatory network dynamics cannot be predicted
using the density of interactions alone.

implying that satellites of the Milky Way should also have companions. The
recent discovery of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates in close proximity to
the Magellanic Clouds provides an opportunity to test this theory. We present
proper motion (PM) measurements for 13 of the 32 new dwarf galaxy candidates

compare the measured 3D velocities of these dwarfs to those expected at the
corresponding distance and location for the debris of an LMC analog in a
cosmological numerical simulation. We conclude that 4 of these galaxies (Hor1,
Car2, Car3 and Hyi1) have come in with the Magellanic Clouds, constituting the
first confirmation of the type of satellite infall predicted by LCDM. Ret2,
Tuc2 and Gru1 have velocity components that are not consistent within 3 sigma
of our predictions and are therefore less favorable. Hya2 and Dra2 could be
associated with the LMC and merit further attention. We rule out Tuc3, Cra2,
Tri2 and Aqu2 as potential members. Of the dwarfs without measured PMs, 5 of
them are deemed unlikely on the basis of their positions and distances alone as
being too far from the orbital plane expected for LMC debris (Eri2, Ind2, Cet2,
Cet3 and Vir1). For the remaining sample, we use the simulation to predict PMs
and radial velocities, finding that Phx2 has an overdensity of stars in DR2
consistent with this PM prediction.

is considered in which a base station (BS) is communicating with two legitimate

cooperative half-duplex relay nodes, powered by the BS, is employed to assist
the BS's transmission. The goal is to design relaying schemes such that the
legitimate users' secrecy rate region is maximized subject to a total power
constraint on the BS and the relays' transmissions. Three relaying schemes are
investigated: cooperative jamming, decode-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward.
Depending on the scheme, secure beamforming signals are carefully designed for
the relay nodes that either diminish the eavesdropper's rate without affecting
that of the legitimate users, or increase the legitimate users' rates without
increasing that of the eavesdropper. The results show that there is no relaying
scheme that fits all conditions; the best relaying scheme depends on the system
parameters, namely, the relays' and eavesdropper's distances from the BS, and
the number of relays. They also show that the relatively simple cooperative
jamming scheme outperforms other schemes when the relays are far from the BS
and/or close to the eavesdropper.

common practice in thermal-hydraulics analysis. An important step in the
uncertainty analysis is the sensitivity analysis of various uncertain input
parameters. The common approach for computing the sensitivities, e.g.
variance-based and regression-based methods, requires solving the governing
equation multiple times, which is expensive in terms of computational cost. An
alternative approach to compute the sensitivities is the adjoint method. The
cost of solving an adjoint equation is comparable to the cost of solving the
governing equation. Once the adjoint solution is available, the sensitivities
to any number of parameters can be obtained with little cost. However,
successful application of adjoint sensitivity analysis to two-phase flow
simulations is rare. In this work, an adjoint sensitivity analysis framework is
developed based on the discrete adjoint method and a new implicit forward
solver. The framework is tested with the faucet flow problem and the BFBT
benchmark. Adjoint sensitivities are shown to match analytical sensitivities
very well in the faucet flow problem. The adjoint method is used to propagate
uncertainty in input parameters to the void fraction in the BFBT benchmark
test. The uncertainty propagation with the adjoint method is verified with the
Monte Carlo method and is shown to be efficient.

precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the
errors are now 2%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5%
precision. With a catalog of ~1000 planets with precise properties, we probed
in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two
classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes.
Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally
under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet
sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially
filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a
planet's orbital distance and its host star mass, both of which are related to
a planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower mass stars, the bimodal
planet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars
producing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the
extent of the `sub-Neptune desert' and the width and slope of the gap support
the view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant
evolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution.

sufficient to explain the observed CH$_3$CN column density profile without

debated. Using data mining in wide-field sky surveys and applying dedicated

confirmed the AGN nature of ten sources (including five previously known

distributions from first principles for a grid of planets at four

predicted size distributions are frequently bimodal and irregular in shape.
There is a negative correlation between total cloud mass and equilibrium
temperature as well as a positive correlation between total cloud mass and
atmospheric mixing. The cloud properties on the east and west limbs show
distinct differences that increase with increasing equilibrium temperature.
Cloud opacities are roughly constant across a broad wavelength range with the
exception of features in the mid-infrared. Forward scattering is found to be
important across the same wavelength range. Using the fully resolved size
distribution of cloud particles as opposed to a mean particle size has a
distinct impact on the resultant cloud opacities. The particle size that
contributes the most to the cloud opacity depends strongly on the cloud
particle size distribution. We predict that it is unlikely that silicate or
titanium clouds are responsible for the optical Rayleigh scattering slope seen
in many hot Jupiters. We suggest that cloud opacities in emission may serve as
sensitive tracers of the thermal state of a planet's deep interior through the

pion transition form factor, which in principle can be accessed in its entirety
by experiment. We demonstrate that, in the absence of a direct measurement, the
full space-like doubly-virtual form factor can be reconstructed very accurately
based on existing data for $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$, $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\pi^0$, and the
$\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ decay width. We derive a representation that
incorporates all the low-lying singularities of the form factor, matches
correctly onto the asymptotic behavior expected from perturbative QCD, and is
suitable for the evaluation of the $(g-2)_\mu$ loop integral. The resulting
value, $a_\mu^{\pi^0\text{-pole}}=62.6^{+3.0}_{-2.5}\times 10^{-11}$, for the
first time, represents a complete data-driven determination of the pion-pole
contribution with fully controlled uncertainty estimates. In particular, we
show that already improved singly-virtual measurements alone would allow one to
further reduce the uncertainty in $a_\mu^{\pi^0\text{-pole}}$.

protected by the thermally stable SPT ordering of the bulk. We also investigate
the gauge color code in this context. Finally, noting that a 1-form symmetry is

that many-body localization (MBL) is unstable in two and higher dimensions due
to a thermalization avalanche triggered by rare regions of weak disorder. To
examine these arguments, we construct several models of a finite ergodic bubble
coupled to an Anderson insulator of non-interacting fermions. We first describe
the ergodic region using a GOE random matrix and perform an exact
diagonalization study of small systems. The results are in excellent agreement
with a refined theory of the thermalization avalanche that includes transient
finite-size effects, lending strong support to the avalanche scenario. We then
explore the limit of large system sizes by modeling the ergodic region via a
Hubbard model with all-to-all random hopping: the combined system, consisting
of the bubble and the insulator, can be reduced to an effective Anderson
impurity problem. We find that the spectral function of a local operator in the
ergodic region changes dramatically when coupling to a large number of
localized fermionic states---this occurs even when the localized sites are
weakly coupled to the bubble. In principle, for a given size of the ergodic
region, this may arrest the avalanche. However, this back-action effect is
suppressed and the avalanche can be recovered if the ergodic bubble is large
enough. Thus, the main effect of the back-action is to renormalize the critical
bubble size.

excess observed in the search for the associated production of Higgs bosons
with the $Z$ neutral gauge boson at LEP, with the Higgs bosons decaying to
bottom quark pairs. On the other hand, the LHCb experiment observed a
discrepancy with respect to the SM expectations of the ratio of the decay of

Since the coupling to heavy quarks could lead to sizable Higgs di-photon rates
in the gluon fusion channel, in this article we propose a common origin of
these anomalies identifying a Higgs associated with the breakdown of the
$U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry and at the same time responsible to the quark
mixing, with the one observed at the LHC. We also discuss the constraints on

absorption in our sample is dominated by outflowing material, with typical
velocities -150 km/s. Approximately 80% of the total column density is
associated with a net outflow. Mass loss rates in the low ionization phase are
comparable to or in excess of the star formation rate, with total outflow rates
likely higher when accounting for ionized gas. Of order half of the heavy
element yield from star formation is ejected in the low ionization phase,
confirming that outflows play a critical role in regulating galaxy chemical
evolution. Covering fractions vary and are in general non-uniform, with most
galaxies having incomplete covering by the low ions across all velocities. Low
ion abundance patterns show remarkably little scatter, revealing a distinct

sequence knee (MS-knee), a feature in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
occurring at the low-mass end of the MS. The magnitude of this feature is
predicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this
reason, its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO)
point has been suggested as a possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular
cluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that the operational definition of the
MS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection point of
the MS (that we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is
well distinct from the knee and that cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee
is only visible in near-infrared CMDs, while the MS-saddle can be also detected
in optical-NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones we then demonstrate
that the absolute magni- tude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex
from one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may
not capture the full systematic error in the method. We also demonstrate that
while the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost coincident in different
models, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations which
is not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable
reference for absolute age determination. Moreover, when statistical and
systematic uncertainties are properly taken into ac- count, the difference in

bodies at the leading order in the post-Newtonian (PN) framework and to linear
order in the spin. These corrections belong to two classes: (i) terms arising
from the coupling between the ordinary tidal terms and the point-particle
terms, which depend on the standard tidal Love numbers of order $l$ and affect
the gravitational-wave (GW) phase at $(2l+5/2)$PN order and (ii) terms
depending on the rotational tidal Love numbers, recently introduced in previous
work, that affect the GW phase at $(2l+1/2+\delta_{2l})$PN order. For circular
orbits and spins orthogonal to the orbital plane, all leading-order spin-tidal
terms enter the GW phase at $1.5$PN order relative to the standard,
quadrupolar, tidal deformability term (and, thus, before the standard octupolar
tidal deformability terms). We present the GW phase that includes all tidal
terms up to $6.5$PN order and to linear order in the spin. We comment on a
conceptual issue related to the inclusion of the rotational tidal Love numbers
in a Lagrangian formulation and on the relevance of spin-tidal couplings for
parameter estimation in coalescing neutron-star binaries and for tests of
gravity.

harmonic functions. These are weight shifting operators that change the spin
and dimension of AdS representations. Together with CFT weight shifting
operators, the new operators obey crossing equations that relate distinct
representations of the conformal group. We apply our findings to the
computation of Witten diagrams, focusing on the particular case of cubic
interactions and on massive, symmetric and traceless fields. In particular we
show that tree level 4-point Witten diagrams with arbitrary spins, both in the
external fields and in the exchanged field, can be reduced to the action of
weight shifting operators on similar 4-point Witten diagrams where all fields
are scalars. We also show how to obtain the conformal partial wave expansion of
these diagrams using the new set of operators. In the case of 1-loop diagrams
with cubic couplings we show how to reduce them to similar 1-loop diagrams with
scalar fields except for a single external spinning field (which must be a
scalar in the case of a two-point diagram). As a bonus, we provide new CFT and
AdS weight shifting operators for mixed-symmetry tensors.

Reed-Solomon codes and multiplicity codes. Both of these families of codes are
based on polynomials over finite fields, and both have been the sources of
recent advances in coding theory. Folded Reed-Solomon codes were the first
explicit constructions of codes known to achieve list-decoding capacity;
multivariate multiplicity codes were the first constructions of high-rate
locally correctable codes; and univariate multiplicity codes are also known to
achieve list-decoding capacity.
  However, previous analyses of the error-correction properties of these codes
did not yield optimal results. In particular, in the list-decoding setting, the
guarantees on the list-sizes were polynomial in the block length, rather than
constant; and for multivariate multiplicity codes, local list-decoding
algorithms could not go beyond the Johnson bound.
  In this paper, we show that Folded Reed-Solomon codes and multiplicity codes
are in fact better than previously known in the context of list-decoding and
local list-decoding. More precisely, we first show that Folded RS codes achieve
list-decoding capacity with constant list sizes, independent of the block
length; and that high-rate univariate multiplicity codes can also be
list-recovered with constant list sizes. Using our result on univariate
multiplicity codes, we show that multivariate multiplicity codes are high-rate,
locally list-recoverable codes. Finally, we show how to combine the above
results with standard tools to obtain capacity achieving locally list decodable
codes with query complexity significantly lower than was known before.

Representation learning algorithms aim to preserve local and global network
structure by identifying node neighborhood notions. However, many existing
algorithms generate embeddings that fail to properly preserve the network
structure, or lead to unstable representations due to random processes (e.g.,
random walks to generate context) and, thus, cannot generate to multi-graph

subgraphs by employing the analogy of graphs with electrical circuits. It
preserves both local and global connectivity patterns, and addresses the issue
of high-degree nodes. Further, it exploits the strength of weak ties and
meta-data that have been neglected by baselines. The experiments show that RECS
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 36.85% on multi-label

diffusive molecular communications (MCs). If a target is present, it
continuously and with a constant rate secretes molecules of a specific type,
so-called biomarkers, into the medium, which are symptomatic for the presence
of the target. Detection of these biomarkers is challenging since due to the
diffusion and degradation, the biomarkers are only detectable in the vicinity
of the target. In addition, the exact location of the target within the tissue
is not known. In this paper, we propose to distribute several reactive
nanosensors (NSs) across the tissue such that at least some of them are
expected to come in contact with biomarkers, which cause them to become
activated. Upon activation, an NS releases a certain number of molecules of a
secondary type into the medium to alert a fusion center (FC), where the final
decision regarding the presence of the target is made. In particular, we
consider a composite hypothesis testing framework where it is assumed that the
location of the target and the biomarker secretion rate are unknown, whereas
the locations of the NSs are known. We derive the uniformly most powerful (UMP)
test for the detection at the NSs. For the final decision at the FC, we show
that the UMP test does not exist. Hence, we derive a genie-aided detector as an
upper bound on performance. We then propose two sub-optimal detectors and
evaluate their performance via simulations

  The proposed approach is motivated by the observation that the aim to deliver
the highest accuracy possible in the broadest range of operational conditions,
which many deep neural networks models strive to achieve, may not necessarily
be always needed, desired, or even achievable due to the lack of data or
technical constraints. In relation to the face recognition problem, we
formulated an example of such a usecase, the `backyard dog' problem. The
`backyard dog', implemented by a lean network, should correctly identify
members from a limited group of individuals, a `family', and should distinguish
between them. At the same time, the network must produce an alarm to an image
of an individual who is not in a member of the family. To produce such a
network, we propose a shallowing algorithm. The algorithm takes an existing
deep learning model on its input and outputs a shallowed version of it. The
algorithm is non-iterative and is based on the Advanced Supervised Principal
Component Analysis. Performance of the algorithm is assessed in exhaustive
numerical experiments. In the above usecase, the `backyard dog' problem, the
method is capable of drastically reducing the depth of deep learning neural
networks, albeit at the cost of mild performance deterioration.
  We developed a simple non-iterative method for shallowing down pre-trained
deep networks. The method is generic in the sense that it applies to a broad
class of feed-forward networks, and is based on the Advanced Supervise

lowering of the unit cell from cubic in the bulk to orthorhombic in the films
results in dramatic differences in the magnetic anisotropy compared to bulk, as
determined from structural and magnetic characterization. Bulk cubic
CoV$_2$O$_4$ has been found to defy predictions by showing orbital degeneracy
seemingly lasting to very low temperatures, with only small anomalies in
magnetization and neutron experiments signaling a possible spin/orbital glass
transition at T = 90 K. In epitaxial thin films presented in this paper,
structurally tuning the CoV$_2$O$_4$ away from cubic symmetry leads to a
completely different low temperature non-collinear ground state. Via
magnetization and neutron scattering measurements we show that the 90 K
transition is associated with a major spin reorientation away from the
ferrimagnetic easy axis [001] to the [110] direction. Furthermore, the V-spins
cant away from this direction with extracted perpendicular moments providing
evidence of a larger canting angle compared to bulk. This result indicates that

interdependent networks under varying levels of failures. Researchers have
considered many different realistic network structures, but thus far no study
has incorporated the hierarchical structure of many networks. For example,
infrastructure across cities will likely be distributed such that nodes are
tightly connected within small neighborhoods, somewhat less connected across
the whole city, and have even fewer connections between cities. Furthermore,
while previous work identified interconnected nodes, those nodes with links
outside their neighborhood, to be more likely to be attacked, here we have
various levels of interconnections (between neighborhoods, between cities,
etc.). We consider the nodes with interconnections at the highest level most
likely to be attacked, followed by those with interconnections at the next
level, etc. We develop an analytic solution for both single and interdependent
networks of this structure and verify our theory through simulations. We find
that depending on the number of levels in the hierarchy there may be multiple
transitions in the giant component (fraction of interconnected nodes), as the
network separates at the various levels. Our results show that these multiple
jumps are a feature of hierarchical networks and can affect the vulnerability
of infrastructure networks.

the projectile mass on the visibility of the FAD patterns is addressed. Both
parameters determine the transverse coherence length of the impinging

that by varying the impact energy, while keeping the same collimating setup and
normal energy, it is possible to control the interference mechanism that
prevails in FAD patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the contribution
coming from different positions of the focus point of the incident particles,
which gives rise to the spot-beam effect, allows projectiles to explore
different zones of a single crystallographic channel when a narrow surface area
is coherently lighted. In this case the spot-beam effect gives also rise to a
non-coherent background, which contributes to the gradual quantum-classical
transition of FAD spectra. Present results are compared with available
experimental data, making evident that the inclusion of focusing effects is
necessary for the proper theoretical description of the experimental
distributions.

  Third-Party Skills on Amazon Alexa and Google Home",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Virtual personal assistants (VPA) (e.g., Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant)
today mostly rely on the voice channel to communicate with their users, which
however is known to be vulnerable, lacking proper authentication. The rapid
growth of VPA skill markets opens a new attack avenue, potentially allowing a
remote adversary to publish attack skills to attack a large number of VPA users
through popular IoT devices such as Amazon Echo and Google Home. In this paper,
we report a study that concludes such remote, large-scale attacks are indeed
realistic. More specifically, we implemented two new attacks: voice squatting
in which the adversary exploits the way a skill is invoked (e.g., ""open capital
one""), using a malicious skill with similarly pronounced name (e.g., ""capital
won"") or paraphrased name (e.g., ""capital one please"") to hijack the voice
command meant for a different skill, and voice masquerading in which a
malicious skill impersonates the VPA service or a legitimate skill to steal the
user's data or eavesdrop on her conversations. These attacks aim at the way
VPAs work or the user's mis-conceptions about their functionalities, and are
found to pose a realistic threat by our experiments (including user studies and
real-world deployments) on Amazon Echo and Google Home. The significance of our
findings have already been acknowledged by Amazon and Google, and further
evidenced by the risky skills discovered on Alexa and Google markets by the new
detection systems we built. We further developed techniques for automatic
detection of these attacks, which already capture real-world skills likely to
pose such threats.

PRV have been associated with diseases in Pacific salmon, including
erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS), HSMI-like disease, and
jaundice/anemia in Japan, Norway, Chile and Canada. We examine the
developmental pathway of HSMI and jaundice/anemia associated with PRV-1 in

respectively. In situ hybridization localized PRV-1 within developing lesions
in both diseases. The two diseases showed dissimilar pathological pathways,
with inflammatory lesions in heart and skeletal muscle in Atlantic salmon, and
degenerative-necrotic lesions in kidney and liver in Chinook salmon, plausibly
explained by differences in PRV load tolerance in red blood cells. Viral genome
sequencing revealed no consistent differences in PRV-1 variants intimately
involved in the development of both diseases, suggesting that migratory Chinook
salmon may be at more than a minimal risk of disease from exposure to the high
levels of PRV occurring on salmon farms.

viscosity $\eta$ and atomic self-diffusion coefficients D, play an essential
role in ultrafast phase switching behavior of novel non-volatile phase-change
memory applications, as they are intimately related to crystallization kinetics
and phase stabilities. To connect $\eta$ to D, the Stokes-Einstein relation
(SER) is commonly assumed to be valid at high temperatures near or above the
melting temperature $T_{m}$ and is frequently employed for assessing liquid
fragility (or crystal growth velocity) of technologically important PCM
compositions. However, using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS), we give
here experimental evidence for a breakdown of the SER even at temperatures
above $T_{m}$ in the high-atomic-mobility state of a typical PCM,
Ge$_{1}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, where the decay of density correlation functions
still remains exponential. The origin of the breakdown is thus unlikely the
result of dynamical heterogeneities, as is usually postulated for viscous
liquids. Rather, we discuss its possible connections to a metal-semiconductor
and fragile-strong transition hidden below $T_{m}$.

  added, general revision",,,,"cs.CG cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Euclidean $k$-center problem is a classical problem that has been
extensively studied in computer science. Given a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $n$
points in Euclidean space, the problem is to determine a set $\mathcal{C}$ of
$k$ centers (not necessarily part of $\mathcal{G}$) such that the maximum
distance between a point in $\mathcal{G}$ and its nearest neighbor in
$\mathcal{C}$ is minimized. In this paper we study the corresponding
$(k,\ell)$-center problem for polygonal curves under the Fr\'echet distance,
that is, given a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $n$ polygonal curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
each of complexity $m$, determine a set $\mathcal{C}$ of $k$ polygonal curves
in $\mathbb{R}^d$, each of complexity $\ell$, such that the maximum Fr\'echet
distance of a curve in $\mathcal{G}$ to its closest curve in $\mathcal{C}$ is
minimized. In this paper, we substantially extend and improve the known
approximation bounds for curves in dimension $2$ and higher. We show that, if
$\ell$ is part of the input, then there is no polynomial-time approximation
scheme unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. Our constructions yield different
bounds for one and two-dimensional curves and the discrete and continuous
Fr\'echet distance. In the case of the discrete Fr\'echet distance on
two-dimensional curves, we show hardness of approximation within a factor close
to $2.598$. This result also holds when $k=1$, and the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness
extends to the case that $\ell=\infty$, i.e., for the problem of computing the
minimum-enclosing ball under the Fr\'echet distance. Finally, we observe that a
careful adaptation of Gonzalez' algorithm in combination with a curve
simplification yields a $3$-approximation in any dimension, provided that an
optimal simplification can be computed exactly. We conclude that our
approximation bounds are close to being tight.

1) learning spatially varying pooling fields that improve model performance

learning a dynamic computation policy for each pixel to decrease total

  We extensively evaluate PAG on a variety of per-pixel labeling tasks,
including semantic segmentation, boundary detection, monocular depth and
surface normal estimation. We demonstrate that PAG allows competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks. Our experiments show that PAG
learns dynamic spatial allocation of computation over the input image which
provides better performance trade-offs compared to related approaches (e.g.,
truncating deep models or dynamically skipping whole layers). Generally, we
observe PAG can reduce computation by $10\%$ without noticeable loss in
accuracy and performance degrades gracefully when imposing stronger
computational constraints.

including substrate effects, using direct numerical simulations. The study
focuses on the effects of three parameters: Ohnesorge number, the ratio of the
viscous forces to inertial and surface tension forces, the liquid filament
aspect ratio, and where there is a substrate, a measure of the fluid slip on
the substrate, i.e. slip length. Through these parameters, it is determined
whether a liquid filament breaks up during the evolution toward its final
equilibrium state. Three scenarios are identified: a collapse into a single
droplet, the breakup into one or multiple droplets, and recoalescence into a
single droplet after the breakup (or even possibly another breakup after
recoalescence). The results are compared with the ones available in the
literature for free-standing liquid filaments. The findings show that the
presence of the substrate promotes breakup of the filament. The effect of the
degree of slip on the breakup is also discussed. The parameter domain regions
are comprehensively explored when including the slip effects. An experimental
case is also carried out to illustrate the collapse and breakup of a
finite-size silicon oil filament supported on a substrate, showcasing a
critical length of the breakup in a physical configuration. Finally, direct
numerical simulations reveal striking new details into the breakup pattern for
low Ohnesorge numbers, where the dynamics are fast and the experimental imaging

scientific community and so far there are many studies in which immunization
strategies have been developed. However, these kind of strategies usually do
not consider that medical institutes may have limited vaccine resources
available. In this manuscript, we explore the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model with local dynamic vaccination, and considering limited vaccines.
In this model, susceptibles in contact with an infected individual, are
vaccinated -with probability $\omega$- and then get infected -with probability
$\beta$. However, when the fraction of immunized individuals reaches a
threshold $V_L$, the vaccination stops, after which only the infection is
possible. In the steady state, besides the critical points $\beta_c$ and
$\omega_c$ that separate a non-epidemic from an epidemic phase, we find for a
range of $V_L$ another transition points, $\beta^*>\beta_c$ and
$\omega^*<\omega_c$, which correspond to a novel discontinuous phase
transition. This critical value separates a phase where the amount of vaccines
is sufficient, from a phase where the disease is strong enough to exhaust all
the vaccination units. For a disease with fixed $\beta$, the vaccination
probability $\omega$ can be controlled in order to drastically reduce the
number of infected individuals, using efficiently the available vaccines.
  Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the system close to $\beta^*$ or
$\omega^*$, shows that after a peak of infection the system enters into a
quasi-stationary state, with only a few infected cases. But if there are no
more vaccines, these few infected individuals could originate a second
outbreak, represented by a second peak of infection. This state of apparent

un-seen (or out-of-vocabulary OOV) words translation. To solve this, some
researchers propose the splitting of western languages such as English and
German into sub-words or compounds. In this paper, we try to address this OOV
issue and improve the NMT adequacy with a harder language Chinese whose
characters are even more sophisticated in composition. We integrate the Chinese
radicals into the NMT model with different settings to address the unseen words
challenge in Chinese to English translation. On the other hand, this also can
be considered as semantic part of the MT system since the Chinese radicals
usually carry the essential meaning of the words they are constructed in.
Meaningful radicals and new characters can be integrated into the NMT systems
with our models. We use an attention-based NMT system as a strong baseline
system. The experiments on standard Chinese-to-English NIST translation shared
task data 2006 and 2008 show that our designed models outperform the baseline
model in a wide range of state-of-the-art evaluation metrics including LEPOR,
BEER, and CharacTER, in addition to BLEU and NIST scores, especially on the
adequacy-level translation. We also have some interesting findings from the
results of our various experiment settings about the performance of words and
characters in Chinese NMT, which is different with other languages. For
instance, the fully character level NMT may perform well or the state of the
art in some other languages as researchers demonstrated recently, however, in
the Chinese NMT model, word boundary knowledge is important for the model
learning.

systems with different number of scrolls and coupled in a master-slave sequence

Itinerary synchronization is proposed to detect synchrony behavior with systems
that can present generalized multistability. Itinerary synchronization consists
in analyzing the symbolic dynamics of the systems by assigning different
numbers to the regions where the scrolls are generated. It is shown that in
certain parameter regimes if the inner connection between nodes is given by
means of considering all the state variables of the system, then itinerary
synchronization occurs and the coordinate motion is determined by the node with
the smallest number of scrolls. Thus the collective behavior in all the nodes
of the network is determined by the node with least scrolls in its attractor
leading to generalized multistability phenomena which can be detected via
itinerary synchronization. Results about attacks to the network are also
presented, for example, when the PWL system is attacked by removing a given
link to produce an open ring configuration. Depending on the inner connection
properties, the nodes present multistability or preservation in the number of
scrolls of the attractors.

Unfortunately, basic estimation results, such as the maximum likelihood

equivalent to maximizing a multinomial likelihood with a restricted parameter
space. A solution using the EM algorithm is presented which is guaranteed to
converge to the global maximizer, even on the boundary of the parameter space.
Two additional closed form estimators are presented with the goal of minimizing

Neandertals and their ancestors, who were genetically differentiated from other
archaic Eurasians (such as the Denisovans of Siberia), as well as modern
humans. Modern humans arrived to Europe by ~45kya, and are first genetically
attested by ~39kya when they were still mixing with Neandertals. The first
Europeans who were recognizably genetically related to modern ones appeared in
the genetic record shortly thereafter at ~37kya. At ~15kya a largely
homogeneous set of hunter-gatherers became dominant in most of Europe, but with
some admixture from Siberian hunter-gatherers in the eastern part of the
continent. These hunter-gatherers were joined by migrants from the Near East
beginning at ~8kya: Anatolian farmers settled most of mainland Europe, and
migrants from the Caucasus reached eastern Europe, forming steppe populations.
After ~5kya there was migration from the steppe into mainland Europe and vice
versa. Present-day Europeans (ignoring the long-distance migrations of the
modern era) are largely the product of this Bronze Age collision of steppe
pastoralists with Neolithic farmers.

more than half of the messages posted by Brazilian deputies are non-political.

averaged temperature. Using the Green's Function (GRF) method, which involves
applying many localized, weak forcings to the system one at a time and
calculating the responses using long-time averaged Direct Numerical Simulations
(DNS), the system's Linear Response Function (LRF) has been computed. Another
matrix, called the Eddy Flux Matrix (EFM), that relates changes in the
divergence of vertical eddy heat fluxes to changes in the state vector, has
also been calculated. Using various tests, it is shown that the LRF and EFM can
accurately predict the time-mean responses of temperature and eddy heat flux to
external forcings, and that the LRF can well predict the forcing needed to
change the mean flow in a specified way (inverse problem). The non-normality of
the LRF is discussed and its eigen/singular vectors are compared with the
leading Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes of the DNS data.
Furthermore, it is shown that if the LRF and EFM are simply scaled by the
square-root of Rayleigh number, they perform equally well for flows at other
$\mathrm{Ra}$, at least in the investigated range of $ 5 \times 10^5 \le
\mathrm{Ra} \le 1.25 \times 10^6$. The GRF method can be applied to develop 1D

concentrated on the set of spanning trees. Pemantle~\cite{PR1991} showed that
on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, equipped with the unit conductance $ c=1$, $\mathsf{USF}$ is

the $\mathsf{USF}$ associated with conductances induced by $\lambda$--biased

as close as possible to the target variable. In this process most algorithms
try to fit all of the data in a single line and hence fitting all parts of
target variable in one go. It was observed that the error between predicted and
target variable usually have a varying behavior across the various quantiles of
the dependent variable and hence single point diagnostic like MAPE has its
limitation to signify the level of fitness across the distribution of
Y(dependent variable). To address this problem, a novel approach is proposed in
the paper to deal with regression fitting over various quantiles of target
variable. Using this approach we have significantly improved the eccentric
behavior of the distance (error) between predicted and actual value of
regression. Our proposed solution is based on understanding the segmented
behavior of the data with respect to the internal segments within the data and
approach for retrospectively fitting the data based on each quantile behavior.

use a simple laser, incoherent with the homodyne receiver, to generate bright

CV-QKD security. These results highlight the feasibility and the impact of the
detector blinding attack. We finally discuss how to design countermeasures in

fitting a distribution of labeled data. We show that it is often possible to
accurately estimate this ""learnability"" even when given an amount of data that
is too small to reliably learn any accurate model. Our first result applies to
the setting where the data is drawn from a $d$-dimensional distribution with
isotropic covariance (or known covariance), and the label of each datapoint is
an arbitrary noisy function of the datapoint. In this setting, we show that
with $O(\sqrt{d})$ samples, one can accurately estimate the fraction of the
variance of the label that can be explained via the best linear function of the
data. In contrast to this sublinear sample size, finding an approximation of
the best-fit linear function requires on the order of $d$ samples. Our
sublinear sample results and approach also extend to the non-isotropic setting,
where the data distribution has an (unknown) arbitrary covariance matrix: we
show that, if the label $y$ of point $x$ is a linear function with independent
noise, $y = \langle x , \beta \rangle + noise$ with $\|\beta \|$ bounded, the
variance of the noise can be estimated to error $\epsilon$ with
$O(d^{1-1/\log{1/\epsilon}})$ if the covariance matrix has bounded condition
number, or $O(d^{1-\sqrt{\epsilon}})$ if there are no bounds on the condition
number. We also establish that these sample complexities are optimal, to
constant factors. Finally, we extend these techniques to the setting of binary
classification, where we obtain analogous sample complexities for the problem
of estimating the prediction error of the best linear classifier, in a natural
model of binary labeled data. We demonstrate the practical viability of our

assume a continuous representation without considering the discrete

from a communications systems engineering perspective. Using Shannon's
communications theory, we posit that information in the brain is represented in
discrete form. We address this hypothesis using 2 approaches. First, we
identify the fundamental communication requirements of the brain. Second, we
estimate the symbol error probability and channel capacity for a continuous
information representation. Our work concludes that information cannot be
communicated and represented reliably in the brain using a continuous
representation - it has to be in a discrete form. This is a major demarcation
from conventional and current wisdom. We apply this discrete result to the 4
major neural coding hypotheses, and illustrate the use of discrete ISI neural
coding in analyzing electrophysiology experimental data. We further posit and
illustrate a plausible direct link between Weber's Law and discrete neural
coding. We end by outlining a number of key research questions on discrete

set to zero in the computer model to achieve the published radiation dose value

the Sun was totally quiet in the solar maximum year 1969 - and also their
colleagues of the subsequent Apollo flights, i.e. until 1972, where the

model allows assessing the total dose of a journey to Mars by only changing the

these systems, and use it to compute the magnetic field geometry, for various

energy range represents the low-energy limit of the string models (degree of

models (degree of freedom: hadrons). A well known spallation model is INCL, the
Li\`ege intranuclear cascade model (combined with a de-excitation model to
complete the reaction). INCL, known to give good results up to 2-3 GeV, was
recently upgraded by the implementation of multiple pion emission to extend the
energy range of applicability up to roughly 15 GeV. The next step, to account
also for strange particle production, both for refining the high energy domain
and making it usable when strangeness appears, requires the following main
ingredients: i) the relevant elementary cross sections (production, scattering,
and absorption) and ii) the characteristics of the associated final states.
Some of those ingredients are already known and, sometimes, are already used in
models of the same type (e.g., Bertini, GiBUU), but this paper aims at
reviewing the situation by compiling, updating, and comparing the necessary
elementary information which are independent of the model used.

dimensions: degree of synchrony, kind of faults, number of faults...
Unfortunately, the sheer number of models and their subtle distinctions hinder
our ability to design a general theory of message-passing models. One way out
of this conundrum restricts communication to proceed by round. A great variety
of message-passing models can then be captured in the Heard-Of model, through
predicates on the messages sent in a round and received during or before this
round. Then, the issue is to find the most accurate Heard-Of predicate to
capture a given model. This is straightforward in synchronous models, because
waiting for the upper bound on communication delay ensures that all available
messages are received, while not waiting forever. On the other hand, asynchrony
allows unbounded message delays. Is there nonetheless a meaningful
characterization of asynchronous models by a Heard-Of predicate?
  We formalize this characterization by introducing Delivered collections: the
collections of all messages delivered at each round, whether late or not.
Predicates on Delivered collections capture message-passing models. The
question is to determine which Heard-Of predicates can be generated by a given
Delivered predicate. We answer this by formalizing strategies for when to
change round. Thanks to a partial order on these strategies, we also find the
""best"" strategy for multiple models, where ""best"" intuitively means it waits
for as many messages as possible while not waiting forever. Finally, a strategy
for changing round that never blocks a process forever implements a Heard-Of
predicate. This allows us to translate the order on strategies into an order on
Heard-Of predicates. The characterizing predicate for a model is then the
greatest element for that order, if it exists.

various expectations associated with Markov chains and processes having
non-stationary transition probabilities. Such non-stationary models arise
naturally in contexts in which time-of-day effects or seasonality effects need
to be incorporated. Our approximations are valid asymptotically in regimes in
which the transition probabilities change slowly over time. Specifically, we
develop approximations for the expected infinite horizon discounted reward, the
expected reward to the hitting time of a set, the expected reward associated
with the state occupied by the chain at time $n$, and the expected cumulative
reward over an interval $[0,n]$. In each case, the approximation involves a
linear system of equations identical in form to that which one would need to
solve to compute the corresponding quantity for a Markov model having
stationary transition probabilities. In that sense, the theory provides an
approximation no harder to compute than in the traditional stationary context.
While most of the theory is developed for finite state Markov chains, we also
provide generalizations to continuous state Markov chains, and finite state
Markov jump processes in continuous time. In the latter context, one of our
approximations coincides with the uniform acceleration asymptotic due to Massey
and Whitt (1998).

Moreover, deeper networks performed better than shallower networks in
distinguishing correct from error trials in all-channel decoding. In single

various homogeneous boundary conditions. Such a model arises from the forced
vibrations of a nonhomogeneous string and propagation of seismic waves in
nonisotropic media. By combining variational methods with an approximation
argument, we prove that there exist infinitely many periodic solutions whenever
the period is a rational multiple of the length of the spatial interval. The
proof is essentially based on the spectral properties of the wave operator with
$x$-dependent coefficients.

nanodroplets. The condensation of vaporized graphite leads to the formation of
partially graphitized carbon, which indicates high temperatures, supposedly
higher than 1000{\deg}C, during condensation. Possible underlying processes
responsible for the instant rise in temperature during condensation are
discussed. This suggests that such processes cause the presence of partially
graphitized carbon dust formed by low-temperature condensation in the diffuse
interstellar medium. Alternatively, in the denser regions of the ISM, the
condensation of carbon atoms together with the most abundant interstellar
molecules (H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO), leads to the formation of complex organic
molecules (COMs) and finally organic polymers. Water molecules were found not
to be involved directly in the reaction network leading to the formation of
COMs. It was proposed that COMs are formed via the addition of carbon atoms to
H$_2$ and CO molecules $(C + H_2 \rightarrow HCH, HCH + CO \rightarrow
OCCH_2)$. Due to the involvement of molecular hydrogen, the formation of COMs
by carbon addition reactions should be more efficient at high extinctions

transition is highly sensitive to the unit cell length, which, in turn, depends
on the level of Eu-stuffing at the Ir-site. Samples with composition close to
the ideal stoichiometry (Eu : Ir $ = $ 1) showed a change of sign of d$\rho/$dT
from negative to positive upon cooling below a certain temperature T $^*$ $>$

conductor $\Sigma$ of the complex plane in the presence of a weakly admissible
external field. An admissible external field $Q$ on $\Sigma$ satisfies, along
with other mild conditions, the following growth property at infinity:
$$\lim_{|x| \rightarrow \infty}(Q(x) - \log |x|) = +\infty.$$ This condition
guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium measure in the
presence of $Q$, and the compactness of its support. In the last 10-15 years,
several papers have dealt with weakly admissible external fields, in the sense
that $Q$ satisfies a weaker condition at infinity, namely, $$\exists
M\in(-\infty,\infty],\quad\liminf_{|x| \rightarrow \infty}(Q(x) - \log |x|) =
M.$$ Under this last assumption, there still exists a unique equilibrium
measure in the external field $Q$, but the support need not be a compact subset
of $\Sigma$ anymore. In most examples considered in the literature the support
is indeed unbounded. Our main goal in this paper is to illustrate this topic by
means of a simple class of external fields on the real axis created by a pair
of attractive and repellent charges in the complex plane, and to study the
dynamics of the associated equilibrium measures as the strength of the charges
evolves. As one of our findings, we exhibit configurations where the support of
the equilibrium measure in a weakly admissible external field is a compact
subset of the real axis. To achieve our goal, we extend some results from
potential theory, known for admissible external fields, to the weakly
admissible case. These new results may be of independent interest. Finally, the
so--called signed equilibrium measure is an important tool in our analysis. Its
relationship with the (positive) equilibrium measure is also explored.

magnetic fields that these otherwise small ed inert, cooling dead stars emit
radio pulses and shine in various part of the electromagnetic spectrum. But the
presence of a strong magnetic field has more subtle and sometimes dramatic
consequences: In the last decades of observations indeed, evidence mounted that
it is likely the magnetic field that makes of an isolated neutron star what it
is among the different observational manifestations in which they come. The
contribution of the magnetic field to the energy budget of the neutron star can
be comparable or even exceed the available kinetic energy. The most magnetised
neutron stars in particular, the magnetars, exhibit an amazing assortment of
explosive events, underlining the importance of their magnetic field in their
lives. In this chapter we review the recent observational and theoretical
achievements, which not only confirmed the importance of the magnetic field in
the evolution of neutron stars, but also provide a promising unification scheme
for the different observational manifestations in which they appear. We focus
on the role of their magnetic field as an energy source behind their persistent
emission, but also its critical role in explosive events.

behaves asymptotically like a Brownian motion. This approach can be extended to
general Markov processes whose driving parameters are taken to a limit, which
can lead to insightful results in contexts like large distributed systems or
queueing networks. The purpose of this paper is to assess the rate of
convergence in these so-called diffusion approximations, in a queueing context.
To this end, we extend the functional Stein method introduced for the Brownian
approximation of Poisson processes, to two simple examples: the single-server
queue and the infinite-server queue. By doing so, we complete the recent
applications of Stein's method to queueing systems, with results concerning the
whole trajectory of the considered process, rather than its stationary
distribution.

provides a flexible trade-off between noise suppression and binaural-cue
preservation of the sound sources in the acoustic scene. It minimizes the
output noise power, under the constraints which guarantee that the target
remains unchanged after processing and the binaural-cue distortions of the
acoustic sources will be less than a user-defined threshold. However, the RBB
problem is a computationally demanding non-convex optimization problem. The
only existing suboptimal method which approximately solves the RBB is a
successive convex optimization (SCO) method which, typically, requires to solve
multiple convex optimization problems per frequency bin, in order to converge.
Convergence is achieved when all constraints of the RBB optimization problem
are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a semi-definite convex relaxation
(SDCR) of the RBB optimization problem. The proposed suboptimal SDCR method
solves a single convex optimization problem per frequency bin, resulting in a
much lower computational complexity than the SCO method. Unlike the SCO method,
the SDCR method does not guarantee user-controlled upper-bounded binaural-cue
distortions. To tackle this problem we also propose a suboptimal hybrid method
which combines the SDCR and SCO methods. Instrumental measures combined with a
listening test show that the SDCR and hybrid methods achieve significantly
lower computational complexity than the SCO method, and in most cases better
trade-off between predicted intelligibility and binaural-cue preservation than
the SCO method.

by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin in 1998. In particular, there are a lot
of results regarding the binary hypercubes, that is, the Hamming graphs
$K_2^n$. In 2008, Gravier et al. started investigating identification in
$K_q^2$. Goddard and Wash, in 2013, studied identifying codes in the general
Hamming graphs $K_q^n$. They stated, for instance, that $\gamma^{ID}(K_q^n)\leq
q^{n-1}$ for any $q$ and $n\geq3$. Moreover, they conjectured that
$\gamma^{ID}(K_q^3)=q^2$. In this article, we show that $\gamma^{ID}(K_q^3)\leq
q^2-q/4$ when $q$ is a power of four, disproving the conjecture. Our approach
is based on the recursive use of suitable designs. Goddard and Wash also gave
the following lower bound $\gamma^{ID}(K_q^3)\ge q^2-q\sqrt{q}$. We improve
this bound to $\gamma^{ID}(K_q^3)\ge q^2-\frac{3}{2} q$. The conventional
methods used for obtaining lower bounds on identifying codes do not help here.
Hence, we provide a different technique building on the approach of Goddard and
Wash. Moreover, we improve the above mentioned bound $\gamma^{ID}(K_q^n)\leq
q^{n-1}$ to $\gamma^{ID}(K_q^n)\leq q^{n-k}$ for $n=3\frac{q^k-1}{q-1}$ when
$q$ is a prime power. For this bound, we utilize suitable linear codes over
finite fields and a class of closely related codes, namely, the
self-locating-dominating codes. In addition, we show that the
self-locating-dominating codes satisfy the result $\gamma^{SLD}(K_q^3)=q^2$
related to the above conjecture.

a single point in $\mathbb{R}^{13}$. We have chosen 13 dimensions so as to
prevent too many points from being labeled as ""noise."" When using a Euclidean
(or Mahalanobis) metric, a simple clustering algorithm will with near certainty
label the majority of points as ""noise."" On pure physical considerations, this
is not possible. Included in our 13 dimensions are four parameters which
describe the coefficients of a cubic polynomial attached to a Gaussian picking
up a general trend, four parameters picking up periodicity in a time series,
two each for amplitude of a wave and period of a wave, and the final five
report the ""leftover"" noise of the detrended and aperiodic time series. Of the
final five parameters, four are the centralized probabilistic moments, and the
final for the relative size of the series. The first main contribution of this
work is to apply a theorem of quantum mechanics about the completeness of the
solutions to the quantum harmonic oscillator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ to estimating
trends in time series. The second main contribution is the method of fitting
parameters. After many numerical trials, we realized that methods such a
Newton-Rhaphson and Levenberg-Marquardt converge extremely fast if the initial
guess is good. Thus we guessed many initial points in our parameter space and
computed only a few iterations, a technique common in Keogh's work on time
series clustering. Finally, we have produced a model which gives incredibly
accurate results quickly. We ackowledge that there are faster methods as well
of more accurate methods, but this work shows that we can still increase
computation speed with little, if any, cost to accuracy in the sense of data
clustering.

various tasks, including highlighting abnormal regions in a medical image. A
common approach consists in training a voxel-level binary classifier on a set
of feature vectors extracted from normal and pathological areas in patients'
scans. However, many pathologies (such as epilepsy) are characterized by
lesions that may be located anywhere in the brain, have various shapes, sizes
and texture. An adequate representation of such a heterogeneity requires a
significant amount of annotated data which is a major issue in the medical
domain. Therefore, we built on a previously proposed approach that considers
epilepsy lesion detection task as a voxel-level outlier detection problem. It
consists in building a oc-SVM classifier for each voxel in the brain volume
using a small number of clinically-guided features El Azami et al., 2016. Our
goal in this study is to make a step forward by replacing the handcrafted
features with automatically learnt representations using neural networks. We
propose a novel version of siamese networks trained on patches extracted from
healthy patients' scans only. This network, composed of stacked autoencoders as
subnetworks, is regularized by the reconstruction error of the patches. It is
designed to learn representations that bring patches centered at the same voxel
localization 'closer' with respect to the chosen metric (i.e. cosine). Finally,
the middle layer representations of the subnetworks are fed to oc-SVM
classifiers at voxel-level. The method is validated on 3 patients' MRI scans

20^{+}$ and/or $19^{+}$ states in $^{264-270}$Ds. Contrary to what was
suggested in experimental papers, it is rather a proton configuration that
leads to this strong hindrance. If not shortened by the electromagnetic decay,
alpha half-lives of $\sim$ 1 s could open new possibilities for studies of
chemical/atomic properties of related elements.

integration of the generalized Stieltjes transform
$S_{\lambda}[f]=\int_0^{\infty} f(x) (\omega+x)^{-\lambda}\mathrm{d}x$ about
$\omega = 0$ where now $\lambda$ is a non-integer positive real number.
Divergent integrals with singularities at the origin are induced by writing
$(\omega+x)^{-\lambda}$ as a binomial expansion about $\omega = 0$ and
interchanging the order of operations of integration and summation. The
prescription of finite part integration is then implemented by interpreting
these divergent integrals as finite part integrals which are rigorously
represented as complex contour integrals. The same contour is then used to
express $S_{\lambda}[f]$ itself as a complex contour integral. This led to the
recovery of the terms missed by naive term-wise integration which themselves
are finite parts of divergent integrals whose singularity is at the finite
upper limit of integration. When the function $f(x)$ has a zero at the origin
of order $m=0,1,\dots$ such that $m-\lambda<0$ the correction terms missed out
by naive term by term integration give the dominant contribution to
$S_{\lambda}[f]$ as $\omega\to 0$. Otherwise, the correction term is
sub-dominant to the leading convergent terms in the naive term by term
integration. We apply these results by obtaining exact and asymptotic
representations of the Kummer and Gauss hypergeometric functions by evaluating
their known Stieltjes integral representations. We then apply the method of
finite part integration to obtain the asymptotic behavior of a generalization
of the Stieltjes integral which is relevant in the calculation of the effective
index of refraction of a shallow potential well.

two distinct regions: behind the source capillary (by changing the fragmentor

this resulted in a lower IM resolving power due to increased diffusion behind
the drift tube. The article thus describes the various trade-offs between ion

such as quasiparticle density, mobility, and scattering. The transport of heat
can be particularly revealing because, in principle, all types of excitations
in a solid may contribute. Heat transport is well understood for phonons and
electrons, but relatively little is known about heat transported by magnetic
excitations. However, during the last about two decades, the magnetic heat
transport attracted increasing attention after the discovery of large and
unusual signatures of it in low-dimensional quantum magnetic cuprate materials.
Today it constitutes an important probe to otherwise often elusive, topological
quasiparticles in a broader class of quantum magnets. This review summarizes
the experimental foundation of this research, i.e. the state of the art for the
magnetic heat transport in the mentioned cuprate materials which host
prototypical low-dimensional antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg models. These
comprise, in particular, the two-dimensional square lattice, and
one-dimensional spin chain and two-leg ladder spin models. It is shown, how
studying the heat transport provides direct access to the thermal occupation
and the scattering of the already quite exotic quasiparticles of these models
which range from spin-1 spin wave and triplon excitations to fractionalized
spin-1/2 spinons. Remarkable transport properties of these quasiparticles have
been revealed: the spin-heat transport often is highly efficient and in some
cases even ballistic, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

B_{n,m})$ and type II MOPs $P_{n,m}$, satisfying non-hermitian orthogonality
with respect to the weight $e^{-z^3}$ on two unbounded contours on $\mathbb C$.
Under the assumption that $$ n,m \to \infty, \quad \frac{n}{n+m}\to \alpha \in
(0, 1) $$ we find the detailed asymptotics of the MOPs, and describe the phase
transitions of this limit behavior as a function of $\alpha$. This description
is given in terms of vector critical measures, which are saddle points of an
energy functional comprising both attracting and repelling forces. These
critical measures are characterized by a cubic equation (spectral curve), and
their components $\mu_j$ live on trajectories of a canonical quadratic
differential $\varpi$ on the Riemann surface of this equation, which was object
of study in our previous paper [Adv. Math. 302 (2016), 1137--1232].
  The asymptotic zero distribution of the polynomials $A_{n,m}$ and $P_{n,m}$
are given by appropriate combinations of the components of the vector critical
measure. However, in the case of the zeros of $B_{n,m}$ the behavior is totally
different, and can be described in terms of the balayage of $\mu_2 - \mu_3$
onto certain curves on the plane. These curves are constructed with the aid of
$\varpi$, and their topology has three very distinct characters, depending on
the value of $\alpha$, and are obtained from the critical graph of $\varpi$.
  Once the trajectories and vector critical measures are studied, the main
asymptotic technical tool is the analysis of a $3\times 3$ Riemann-Hilbert
problem characterizing the MOPs.
  We illustrate our findings with results of several numerical experiments, and
formulate some conjectures and empirical observations based on these
experiments.

address two facets of this problem: why should rational agents assign
subjective probabilities to branching events, and why should branching events
happen with relative frequencies matching their objective probabilities. To
address the first question, we generalise the Deutsch-Wallace theorem to a wide
class of many-world theories, and show that the subjective probabilities are
given by a norm that depends on the dynamics of the theory: the 2-norm in the
usual Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and the 1-norm in a
classical many-worlds theory known as Kent's universe. To address the second
question, we show that if one takes the objective probability of an event to be
the proportion of worlds in which this event is realised, then in most worlds
the relative frequencies will approximate well the objective probabilities.
This suggests that the task of determining the objective probabilities in a
many-worlds theory reduces to the task of determining how to assign a measure
to the worlds.

inversion center in tetragonal phase, which allows piezoelectric effect at low
carrier concentration. The variations of $\mu(T)$ behavior results from (1) the

interaction; (2) the residual interaction of polaron with 2 longitudinal
optical phonons can be ignored at low temperature, but is important at higher

control flow. These applications benefit from the ability to make rapid

  This paper presents a programming model for distributed machine learning that

Our approach extends the use of dataflow graphs to represent machine learning
models, offering several distinctive features. First, the branches of
conditionals and bodies of loops can be partitioned across many machines to run
on a set of heterogeneous devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and custom ASICs.
Second, programs written in our model support automatic differentiation and
distributed gradient computations, which are necessary for training machine
learning models that use control flow. Third, our choice of non-strict
semantics enables multiple loop iterations to execute in parallel across
machines, and to overlap compute and I/O operations.

time, the relaxation profile of the spin has a similar exponential form to the

amplification, yet there is no observational evidence to prove that such a
mechanism is at play. By using a number of measured properties of galaxies, and
scaling relations where there are no direct measurements, we model samples of
SDSS and S$^4$G spiral galaxies in terms of their relative halo, bulge and disc
mass and size. Using these models, we test predictions of swing amplification
theory with respect to directly measured spiral arm numbers from Galaxy Zoo 2.
We find that neither a universal cored or cuspy inner dark matter profile can
correctly predict observed numbers of arms in galaxies. However, by invoking a
halo contraction/expansion model, a clear bimodality in the spiral galaxy
population emerges. Approximately 40 per cent of unbarred spiral galaxies at $z
\lesssim 0.1$ and $\mathrm{M_*} \gtrsim 10^{10} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ have spiral
arms that can be modelled by swing amplification. This population display a
significant correlation between predicted and observed spiral arm numbers,
evidence that they are swing amplified modes. The remainder are dominated by
two-arm systems for which the model predicts significantly higher arm numbers.
These are likely driven by tidal interactions or other mechanisms.

When it comes to controlling the devices of large-scale swarms there are two
main lines of thought. Centralized control, where all decisions - and often
compute - happen in a centralized back-end cloud system, and distributed
control, where edge devices are responsible for selecting and executing tasks
with minimal or zero help from a centralized entity. In this work we aim to
quantify the trade-offs between the two approaches with respect to task
assignment quality, latency, and reliability. We do so first on a local swarm
of 12 programmable drones with a 10-server cluster as the backend cloud, and
then using a validated simulator to study the tail at scale effects of swarm
coordination control. We conclude that although centralized control almost
always outperforms distributed in the quality of its decisions, it faces
significant scalability limitations, and we provide a list of system challenges
that need to be addressed for centralized control to scale.

match-making, and recommender systems, ranging from employment sites to sharing
economy platforms. As ranking positions influence the amount of attention the
ranked subjects receive, biases in rankings can lead to unfair distribution of
opportunities and resources, such as jobs or income.
  This paper proposes new measures and mechanisms to quantify and mitigate
unfairness from a bias inherent to all rankings, namely, the position bias,
which leads to disproportionately less attention being paid to low-ranked
subjects. Our approach differs from recent fair ranking approaches in two
important ways. First, existing works measure unfairness at the level of
subject groups while our measures capture unfairness at the level of individual
subjects, and as such subsume group unfairness. Second, as no single ranking
can achieve individual attention fairness, we propose a novel mechanism that
achieves amortized fairness, where attention accumulated across a series of
rankings is proportional to accumulated relevance.
  We formulate the challenge of achieving amortized individual fairness subject
to constraints on ranking quality as an online optimization problem and show
that it can be solved as an integer linear program. Our experimental evaluation
reveals that unfair attention distribution in rankings can be substantial, and
demonstrates that our method can improve individual fairness while retaining
high ranking quality.

understanding of systems behavior for the purpose of improving their
performance. Such logs contain various types of information, including
sensitive information. Information deemed sensitive can either directly be
extracted from system log entries by correlation of several log entries, or can
be inferred from the combination of the (non-sensitive) information contained
within system logs with other logs and/or additional datasets. The analysis of
system logs containing sensitive information compromises data privacy.
Therefore, various anonymization techniques, such as generalization and
suppression have been employed, over the years, by data and computing centers
to protect the privacy of their users, their data, and the system as a whole.
Privacy-preserving data resulting from anonymization via generalization and
suppression may lead to significantly decreased data usefulness, thus,
hindering the intended analysis for understanding the system behavior.
Maintaining a balance between data usefulness and privacy preservation,
therefore, remains an open and important challenge. Irreversible encoding of
system logs using collision-resistant hashing algorithms, such as SHAKE-128, is
a novel approach previously introduced by the authors to mitigate data privacy
concerns. The present work describes a study of the applicability of the
encoding approach from earlier work on the system logs of a production high

For this we use the solutions for the scalar field with mass $m$ in the
deformed Schwarzschild background and the corresponding quantized energies of
the system, which represent the stationary states of the field and yield the
stable part of the quantum vacuum energy. The analysis is made here by
considering the limit for which the source mass, $M$, approaches zero, in order
to verify the effects on the global Casimir effect in mini black holes near to
the Planck scale, $\omega_P$. We find a singular behavior for the regularized
vacuum energy at zero temperature and for all the corresponding thermodynamic
quantities when $m^2=\omega^2_P/\xi$, what can be seen as the limit of validity
of the model. Furthermore, we show that the remnant Casimir tension over the
event horizon in the limit $M\to 0$ is finite for any temperature and all the

detect forward nucleons at the both sides of the interaction point and estimate
the collision centrality. The energy deposited in a ZDC fluctuates from one

they are affected by the ZDC acceptance, and the ZDC energy resolution depends
on the beam energy. In this work a simple combinatorial model leading to handy

forward nucleons taking into account a limited ZDC acceptance. The ZDC energy
spectra from the EMD with the emission of one, two, three and four forward

possible to obtain an unprecedented agreement of the zero and
finite-temperature optical gaps and absorption spectra with the experimental
results. The bare energies were calculated by solving the Kohn-Sham equations,
whereas G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ many body perturbation theory was used to extract the
excited state energies. A coupled electron-hole Bethe-Salpeter equation was
solved incorporating the polaronic energies to show that it is the in-plane
torsional acoustic phonon branch that contributes mostly to the A and B exciton
build-up. We find that the three A, B and C excitonic peaks exhibit different
behaviour with temperature, displaying different non-radiative linewidths.
There is no considerable transition in the strength of the excitons with
temperature but A-exciton exhibits darker nature in comparison to C-exciton.
Further, all the excitonic peaks redshifts as temperature rises.
Renormalization of the bare electronic energies by phonon interactions and the
anharmonic lattice thermal expansion causes a decreasing band-gap with
increasing temperature. The zero point energy renormalization (31 meV) is found
to be entirely due to the polaronic interaction with negligible contribution
from lattice anharmonicites. These findings may find a profound impact on
electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on these monolayers.

uncontrolled time-dependent changes of the system. However, if the effects of
the random interaction with a noisy environment are properly modeled by the
introduction of a given stochasticity within the dynamics of the system, then
even noise contributions might be seen as control knobs. As a matter of fact,
even a partial knowledge of the environment can allow to set the system in a
dynamical condition in which the response is optimized by the presence of noise
sources. In particular, we have investigated what kind of measurement devices
can work better in noisy dynamical regimes and studied how to maximize the
resultant information via the adoption of estimation algorithms. Moreover, we
have shown the optimal interplay between quantum dynamics, environmental noise
and complex network topology in maximizing the energy transport efficiency.
Then, foundational scientific aspects, such as the occurrence of an ergodic
property for the system-environment interaction modes of a randomly perturbed
quantum system or the characterization of the stochastic quantum Zeno
phenomena, have been analyzed by using the predictions of the large deviation
theory. Finally, the energy cost in maintaining the system in the
non-equilibrium regime due to the presence of the environment is evaluated by
reconstructing the corresponding thermodynamics entropy production. In
conclusion, the present thesis can constitute the basis for an effective
resource theory of noise, which is given by properly engineering the

H$_2$CO (3-2) lines. This core is relatively massive ($M$ = 17.6 M$_\odot$),
subvirialized (virial parameter $\alpha_{vir}=M_{vir}/M=0.14$), and is barely
affected by turbulence (transonic Mach number of 1.2). Using the HCO$^+$ (3-2)

virial equilibrium, more consistent with competitive accretion scenarios rather

size, representation learning exposes an interesting opportunity for enhanced
medical decision support systems. On the other hand, medical imaging data is
often scarce and short on annotations. In this paper, we present an assessment
of unsupervised feature learning approaches for images in the biomedical
literature, which can be applied to automatic biomedical concept detection. Six
unsupervised representation learning methods were built, including traditional
bags of visual words, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Each
model was trained, and their respective feature space evaluated using images
from the ImageCLEF 2017 concept detection task. We conclude that it is possible
to obtain more powerful representations with modern deep learning approaches,
in contrast with previously popular computer vision methods. Although
generative adversarial networks can provide good results, they are harder to
succeed in highly varied data sets. The possibility of semi-supervised
learning, as well as their use in medical information retrieval problems, are
the next steps to be strongly considered.

contamination for CE users. Based on the above system model, we derive
analytical expressions for the UL signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR)

accuracy. While great progress has been made, state-of-the-art algorithms still

is important that automated cars foresee problems ahead as early as possible.
This is also of paramount importance if the driver will be asked to take over.
We conjecture that failures do not occur randomly. For instance, driving models
may fail more likely at places with heavy traffic, at complex intersections,
and/or under adverse weather/illumination conditions. This work presents a
method to learn to predict the occurrence of these failures, i.e. to assess how
difficult a scene is to a given driving model and to possibly give the human
driver an early headsup. A camera-based driving model is developed and trained
over real driving datasets. The discrepancies between the model's predictions
and the human `ground-truth' maneuvers were then recorded, to yield the
`failure' scores. Experimental results show that the failure score can indeed
be learned and predicted. Thus, our prediction method is able to improve the
overall safety of an automated driving model by alerting the human driver
timely, leading to better human-vehicle collaborative driving.

correct-by-construction controllers using control certificates. We use
nonlinear dynamical systems to model the physical environment (plants). The
goal is to synthesize controllers for these plants while guaranteeing formal
correctness w.r.t. given specifications. We consider different fundamental
specifications including stability, safety, and reach-while-stay. Stability
specification states that the execution traces of the system remain close to an
equilibrium state and approach it asymptotically. Safety specification requires
the execution traces to stay in a safe region. Finally, for reach-while-stay
specification, safety is needed until a target set is reached.
  The design task consists of two phases. In the first phase, the control
design problem is reduced to the question of finding a control certificate.
More precisely, the goal of the first phase is to define a class of control
certificates with a specific structure. This definition should guarantee the
following: ""Having a control certificate, one can systematically design a
controller and prove its correctness at the same time."" The goal in the second
phase is to find such a control certificate. We define a potential control
certificate space (hypothesis space) using parameterized functions. Next, we
provide an inductive search framework to find proper parameters, which yield a
control certificate.
  Finally, we evaluate our framework. We show that discovering control
certificates is practically feasible and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
automatically designed controllers through simulations and real physical
systems experiments.

a more broad definition of automata-type objects, called labelled graphs, where
each transition label can be any string, as long as that string represents a

subset of that monoid. We do the same for regular expressions. We obtain
extensions of a few classic algorithmic constructions on ordinary regular
expressions and transducers at the broad level of labelled graphs and in such a
way that the computational efficiency of the extended constructions is not

tracked by using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is able to handle the

train position parameters. It is shown that in the considered scenario the TOA
measurements are able to achieve better accuracy compared to the AOD

is achieved, when both of the measurements are considered. In this case, a very
high, sub-meter, tracking accuracy can be achieved for most (>75%) of the

different aspects, like efficacy, visualization, and interpretability. In this
paper, we propose, t-PINE, a method that addresses these limitations. Contrary
to baseline methods, which generally learn explicit graph representations by
solely using an adjacency matrix, t-PINE avails a multi-view information graph,
the adjacency matrix represents the first view, and a nearest neighbor
adjacency, computed over the node features, is the second view, in order to
learn explicit and implicit node representations, using the Canonical Polyadic
(a.k.a. CP) decomposition. We argue that the implicit and the explicit mapping
from a higher-dimensional to a lower-dimensional vector space is the key to
learn more useful, highly predictable, and gracefully interpretable
representations. Having good interpretable representations provides a good
guidance to understand how each view contributes to the representation learning
process. In addition, it helps us to exclude unrelated dimensions. Extensive
experiments show that t-PINE drastically outperforms baseline methods by up to
158.6% with respect to Micro-F1, in several multi-label classification

combination of the dictionary atoms. This result also holds for the case when
the KL-divergence is replaced by the well known Hellinger distance. From an
applications perspective, we present an extension of the aforementioned
framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices (which can be
identified with the manifold of zero mean gaussian distributions),
$\mathcal{P}_n$. We present experiments involving a variety of dictionary-based
reconstruction and classification problems in Computer Vision. Performance of
the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it to several

as well as sparsity of the chosen representation.

minimum time function of control problems which is based on reachable set
approximation and uses arithmetic operations for convex compact sets. In
particular, in this paper the theoretical justification of the proposed
approach is restricted to a class of linear control systems. The error estimate
of the fully discrete reachable set is provided by employing the Hausdorff
distance to the continuous-time reachable set. The detailed procedure solving
the corresponding discrete set-valued problem is described. Under standard
assumptions, by means of convex analysis and knowledge of the regularity of the
true minimum time function, we estimate the error of its approximation.
Higher-order discretization of the reachable set of the linear control problem
can balance missing regularity (e.g., Holder continuity) of the minimum time
function for smoother problems. To illustrate the error estimates and to
demonstrate differences to other numerical approaches we provide a collection
of numerical examples which either allow higher order of convergence with
respect to time discretization or where the continuity of the minimum time
function cannot be sufficiently granted, i.e., we study cases in which the
minimum time function is Holder continuous or even discontinuous.

unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) is increasing sharply. Due to the complex
nonlinear dynamics, a huge research interest is witnessed in developing
learning machine based intelligent, self-organizing evolving controller for
these vehicles notably to address the system's dynamic characteristics. In this
work, such an evolving controller namely Generic-controller (G-controller) is
proposed to control the altitude of a rotary wing UAV namely hexacopter. This
controller can work with very minor expert domain knowledge. The evolving
architecture of this controller is based on an advanced incremental learning
algorithm namely Generic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GENEFIS). The
controller does not require any offline training, since it starts operating
from scratch with an empty set of fuzzy rules, and then add or delete rules on
demand. The adaptation laws for the consequent parameters are derived from the
sliding mode control (SMC) theory. The Lyapunov theory is used to guarantee the
stability of the proposed controller. In addition, an auxiliary robustifying
control term is implemented to obtain a uniform asymptotic convergence of
tracking error to zero. Finally, the G-controller's performance evaluation is
observed through the altitude tracking of a UAV namely hexacopter for various
trajectories.

studies have suggested hybrid memory architecture employing both Dynamic Random
Access Memory (DRAM) and NVM in a memory system. By conducting a comprehensive
experiments, we have observed that such studies lack to consider very important

Operating System level in a hybrid DRAMNVM memory architecture. In the proposed
scheme, two Least Recently Used (LRU) queues, one for DRAM section and one for
NVM section, are used for the sake of data migration. With careful
characterization of the workloads obtained from PARSEC benchmark suite, the
proposed scheme prevents unnecessary migrations and only allows migrations
which benefits the system in terms of power and performance. The experimental
results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the power consumption up to
79% compared to DRAM-only memory and up to 48% compared to the state-of-the art

accelerator microarchitecture dictates the dataflow(s) that can be employed to

have a large impact on utilization and energy efficiency, but there is a lack
of understanding on the choices and consequences of dataflows, and of tools and

subspaces over a field k - an important domain of interpretation for circuit
diagrams appearing in diverse research areas. We present by generators and
equations the PROP IH of string diagrams whose free model is SVk. IH stands for
interacting Hopf algebras: its equations arise by distributive laws between
Hopf algebras, which we obtain using Lack's technique for composing PROPs. The
significance of the result is two-fold. First, it offers a canonical
diagrammatic syntax for linear algebra: linear maps, kernels, subspaces, etc...
are all faithfully represented in the graphical language. Second, the equations
of IH describe familiar algebraic structures - Hopf algebras and Frobenius
algebras - which are at the heart of graphical formalisms as seemingly diverse
as quantum circuits, signal flow graphs, simple electrical circuits and Petri
nets. Our characterisation enlightens the provenance of these axioms and
reveals their linear algebraic nature. Our second main contribution is an
application of IH to the semantics of signal processing circuits. We develop a
formal theory of signal flow graphs, featuring a diagrammatic circuit syntax, a
structural operational semantics and a denotational semantics. We prove
completeness of the equations of IH for denotational equivalence. Also, we
study full abstraction: it turns out that the purely operational picture is too
concrete - two denotationally equal graphs may exhibit different operational
behaviour. We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph
can be realised - rewritten, using the equations of IH, into an executable form
where the operational behaviour and the denotation coincide. This realisability
theorem suggests a reflection about the role of causality in the semantics of
signal flow graphs and, more generally, of computing devices.

so-called single-node reservoir computing architecture, especially suitable for
implementation in ultrahigh-speed hardware. The combination of both methods and
the resulting reduction of time required for performance optimization of a
hardware system establish a strategy towards machine learning hardware capable
of self-adaption to optimally solve specific problems. We confirm the validity
of those principles building reservoir computing hardware based on a

with a discrete spectrum. This fact open the possibility to test a possible

such systems. One approach to effectively take advantage of SSDs is to use them
as a caching layer to store performance critical data blocks to reduce the
number of accesses to disk subsystem. Due to characteristics of Flash-based
SSDs such as limited write endurance and long latency on write operations,
employing caching algorithms at the Operating System (OS) level necessitates to
take such characteristics into consideration. Previous caching techniques are
optimized towards only one type of application, which affects both generality
and applicability. In addition, they are not adaptive when the workload pattern
changes over time. This paper presents an efficient Reconfigurable Cache
Architecture (ReCA) for storage systems using a comprehensive workload
characterization to find an optimal cache configuration for I/O intensive
applications. For this purpose, we first investigate various types of I/O
workloads and classify them into five major classes. Based on this
characterization, an optimal cache configuration is presented for each class of
workloads. Then, using the main features of each class, we continuously monitor
the characteristics of an application during system runtime and the cache
organization is reconfigured if the application changes from one class to
another class of workloads. The cache reconfiguration is done online and
workload classes can be extended to emerging I/O workloads in order to maintain
its efficiency with the characteristics of I/O requests. Experimental results
obtained by implementing ReCA in a server running Linux show that the proposed
architecture improves performance and lifetime up to 24\% and 33\%,
respectively.

computer vision tasks in the last five years. Given the challenge in collecting
real world datasets, most studies report performance metrics based on available
research datasets. In scenarios where CNNs are to be deployed on images or
videos from mobile devices, models are presented with new challenges due to
lighting, angle, and camera specifications, which are not accounted for in
research datasets. It is essential for assessment to also be conducted on real
world datasets if such models are to be reliably integrated with products and
services in society. Plant disease datasets can be used to test CNNs in real
time and gain insight into real world performance. We train a CNN object
detection model to identify foliar symptoms of diseases (or lack thereof) in
cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We then deploy the model on a mobile app
and test its performance on mobile images and video of 720 diseased leaflets in
an agricultural field in Tanzania. Within each disease category we test two
levels of severity of symptoms - mild and pronounced, to assess the model
performance for early detection of symptoms. In both severities we see a
decrease in the F-1 score for real world images and video. The F-1 score
dropped by 32% for pronounced symptoms in real world images (the closest data
to the training data) due to a drop in model recall. If the potential of
smartphone CNNs are to be realized our data suggest it is crucial to consider
tuning precision and recall performance in order to achieve the desired
performance in real world settings. In addition, the varied performance related
to different input data (image or video) is an important consideration for the
design of CNNs in real world applications.
