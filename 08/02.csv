arguing that the accelerated expansion of the universse can be viewed as the
emergence of cosmic space as cosmic time progresses, with the expansion
triggered due to the difference in the degrees of freedom on a holographic
surface and the one in its emerged bulk. We show that the modified expansion
law of the universe proposed by Sheykhi in a non-flat Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe and by Cai in a flat FRW universe could be
derived starting from the first law of thermodynamics, in (n+1) dimensional
Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet and more general Lovelock gravity theories. We
have also derived the modified versions of the expansion law for a flat
universe due to Yang et al, in the case of Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravities,
from the first law of thermodynamics. This approach is unique in the sense that
all these modified versions of the expansion law is derived from a
thermodynamic identity that has the same form regardless of the gravity theory
and irrespective of whether the universe is flat or non-flat

understanding of the microstructure of 3D-printed hardened cement paste (hcp).
This work investigates the microstructural features of architectured
cement-based materials, including processing-induced heterogeneous patterns,
interfacial regions (IRs), and pore network distributions with respect to the
architectural pattern. A 3D printer was modified and merged with an extrusion
system and specimens were 3D-printed using a layer-wise direct ink writing
(DIW) process capable of fabrication of lamellar architectures of materials. A
lab-based X-ray microscope (XRM) was used to perform X-ray micro-computed
tomography (micro-CT) evaluations to explore the microstructural
characteristics of 3-day old intact (i.e. not tested) 3D printed and cast
specimens at two levels of magnification: 0.4X and 4X. CT scans of printed
specimen revealed a patterned pore network and several microstructural
features, including: a) macropores, b) micropores at interfacial regions (IRs),
c) accumulation of anhydrous cement particles near macropores, and d)
rearrangement of filaments away from their designed toolpath. In comparison,
microstructural investigation of cast specimen at 4X scan revealed randomly
distributed pores with no connectivity throughout the specimen. The aptitude of
micro-CT as a non-destructive technique for microstructural characterization is
discussed. The role of processing to induce and to pattern heterogeneities such
as IRs in materials is demonstrated and the role of architecture in controlling
such heterogeneities and their directionality through the interface is
discussed.

correlated electron behavior, including heavy-fermion physics, magnetism,
superconductivity and nematicity. The complicated behavior of these entangled
phenomena leads to a variety of exotic physical properties, which, despite the
seemingly simple crystal structure of these compounds, remain poorly
understood. It is generally accepted that the interplay between the itinerant
and local character of Ce-$4f$ electrons is the key to their exotic behavior.
Here, we report theoretical evidence that the Ce-115 materials are also
topological semi-metals, with Dirac fermions around well-separated nodes. Dirac
nodes in each compound are present on the $\Gamma-Z$ plane close to the Fermi
level. As the Dirac bands are derived from In-orbitals, they occur in all
family members irrespective of the transition metal (Co,Rh,Ir). We present the
expected Fermi-arc surface state patterns and show the close proximity of a
topological Lifshitz transition, which possibly explains the high field physics
of Ce-115 materials. Experimentally, we highlight the surprising similarity of
Ce(Co,Rh,Ir)In$_5$ in high magnetic fields, despite the distinctly different
states of the Ce-$4f$ electrons. These results raise questions about the role
Dirac fermions play in exotic transport behavior, and we propose this class of
materials as a prime candidate for unconventional topological
superconductivity.

the rocky planets HD219134b and c. These exospheres are formed by surface
particles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar
wind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are
driven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained
by Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most
well constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets
to their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus
the sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,
refractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from
the entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg
creating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,
extending to several planetary radii. For planet b, the column density of OI
along the line of sight reaches 10^{13}/cm2, with the highest values found
ahead of its orbital motion. This asymmetry would create asymmetric transit
profiles. To assess its observability, we use a ray tracing technique to
compute the expected transit depth of the OI exosphere of planet b. We find
that the transit depth in the OI 1302.2A line is 0.042%, which is a small
increase relative to the continuum transit (0.036%). This implies that the
sputtered exosphere of HD219134b is unlikely to be detectable with our current
UV instruments.

explore the possibility of measuring Oort clouds around other stars through
their emission at submillimeter wavelengths. Observations with the 545 and 857
GHz bands of the Planck satellite are well matched to the expected temperatures
of Oort cloud bodies (on the order of 10 K). By correlating the Planck maps
with catalogs of stars observed by the Gaia mission, we are able to constrain
interesting regions of the exo-Oort cloud parameter space, placing limits on
the total mass and the minimum size of grains in the cloud. We compare our
measurements with known debris disk systems -- in the case of Vega and
Fomalhaut we find a significant excess that is in agreement with measurements
from Herschel. We use the measurements around Fomalhaut to constrain a possible
exo-Oort cloud of that system. We explore an observed excess around the
brightest and nearest stars in our sample as arising from possible exo-Oort
clouds or other extended sources of thermal emission. We argue that future CMB
surveys and targeted observations with far-infrared and millimeter wavelength
telescopes have the potential to detect exo-Oort clouds or other extended
sources of thermal emission beyond $\sim 1000$ AU from the parent stars.

Kaufman [Proc. 58th FOCS, 2017], which are samplers with additional
combinatorial properties, and whose existence we prove using high dimensional
expanders.
  The ABNNR code construction [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 38(2):509--516,
1992] achieves large distance by starting with a base code $C$ with moderate
distance, and then amplifying the distance using a sampler. We show that if the
sampler is part of a larger double sampler then the construction has an
efficient list-decoding algorithm. Our algorithm works even if the ABNNR
construction is not applied to a base code $C$ but to any string. In this case
the resulting code is approximate-list-decodable, i.e. the output list contains
an approximation to the original input.
  Our list-decoding algorithm works as follows: it uses a local voting scheme
from which it constructs a unique games constraint graph. The constraint graph
is an expander, so we can solve unique games efficiently. These solutions are
the output of the list decoder. This is a novel use of a unique games algorithm
as a subroutine in a decoding procedure, as opposed to the more common
situation in which unique games are used for demonstrating hardness results.
  Double samplers and high dimensional expanders are akin to pseudorandom
objects in their utility, but they greatly exceed random objects in their
combinatorial properties. We believe that these objects hold significant
potential for coding theoretic constructions and view this work as
demonstrating the power of double samplers in this context.

  tracking data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Improved communication systems, shrinking battery sizes and the price drop of
tracking devices have led to an increasing availability of trajectory tracking
data. These data are often analyzed to understand animal behavior.
  In this work, we propose a new model for interpreting the animal movent as a
mixture of characteristic patterns, that we interpret as different behaviors.
The probability that the animal is behaving according to a specific pattern, at
each time instant, is non-parametrically estimated using the Logistic-Gaussian
process. Owing to a new formalization and the way we specify the
coregionalization matrix of the associated multivariate Gaussian process, our
model is invariant with respect to the choice of the reference element and of
the ordering of the probability vector components. We fit the model under a
Bayesian framework, and show that the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm we
propose is straightforward to implement.
  We perform a simulation study with the aim of showing the ability of the
estimation procedure to retrieve the model parameters. We also test the
performance of the information criterion we used to select the number of
behaviors. The model is then applied to a real dataset where a wolf has been
observed before and after procreation. The results are easy to interpret, and
clear differences emerge in the two phases.

Goldstone theorem to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that possess a discrete
antilinear symmetry such as $PT$. They restricted their discussion to those
realizations of antilinear symmetry in which all the energy eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian are real. Here we extend the discussion to the two other
realizations possible with antilinear symmetry, namely energies in complex
conjugate pairs or Jordan-block Hamiltonians that are not diagonalizable at
all. In particular, we show that under certain circumstances it is possible for
the Goldstone boson mode itself to be one of the zero-norm states that are
characteristic of Jordan-block Hamiltonians. While we discuss the same model as
Alexandre et al. our treatment is quite different, though their main conclusion
that one can have Goldstone bosons in the non-Hermitian case remains intact. In
their paper Alexandre et al. presented a variational procedure for the action
in which the surface term played an explicit role, to thus suggest that one has
to use such a procedure in order to establish the Goldstone theorem in the
non-Hermitian case. However, by taking certain fields that they took to be
Hermitian to actually either be anti-Hermitian or be made so by a similarity
transformation, we show that we are then able to obtain a Goldstone boson using
a completely standard variational procedure. Since we use a standard
variational procedure we can readily extend our analysis to a continuous local
symmetry by introducing a gauge boson. We show that when we do this the gauge
boson acquires a non-zero mass by the Higgs mechanism in all realizations of
the antilinear symmetry, except the one where the Goldstone boson itself has
zero norm, in which case, and despite the fact that the continuous local
symmetry has been spontaneously broken, the gauge boson remains massless.

test case, we assess the impact of dimension-8 operators within the context of
the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Dimension-8--SM-interference and
dimension-6-squared terms appear at the same order in an expansion in
$1/\Lambda$, hence dimension-8 effects can be treated as a systematic
uncertainty on the new physics inferred from analyses using dimension-6
operators alone. To study the phenomenological consequences of dimension-8
operators, one must first determine the complete set of operators that can
contribute to a given process. We accomplish this through a combination of
Hilbert series methods, which yield the number of invariants and their field
content, and a step-by-step recipe to convert the Hilbert series output into a
phenomenologically useful format. The recipe we provide is general and applies
to any other process within the dimension $\le 8$ Standard Model Effective
Theory. We quantify the effects of dimension-8 by turning on one dimension-6
operator at a time and setting all dimension-8 operator coefficients to the
same magnitude. Under this procedure and given the current accuracy on
$\sigma(pp \to h\,W^+)$, we find the effect of dimension-8 operators on the
inferred new physics scale to be small, $\mathcal O(\text{few}\,\%)$, with some
variation depending on the relative signs of the dimension-8 coefficients and
on which dimension-6 operator is considered. The impact of the dimension-8
terms grows as $\sigma(pp \to h\,W^+)$ is measured more accurately or (more
significantly) in high-mass kinematic regions. We provide a FeynRules
implementation of our operator set to be used for further more detailed
analyses.

computing the string tension between two charges. It is finite (vanishing) if
the fermions are massive (massless) corresponding to the occurrence of
confinement (screening). Motivated by the possibility of experimentally
simulate the Schwinger model, we investigate here the robustness of its
screened and confined phases. Firstly, we analyze the effect of
nearest-neighbour density-density interaction terms, which -- in the absence of
the gauge fields -- give rise to the Thirring model. The resulting
Schwinger-Thirring model is studied, also in presence of a topological $\theta$
term, showing that the massless (massive) model remains screened (confined) and
that there is deconfinement only for $\theta=\pm\pi$ in the massive case.
Estimates of the parameters of the Schwinger-Thirring model are provided with a
discussion of a possible experimental setup for its realization with ultracold
atoms. The possibility that the gauge fields live in higher dimensions while
the fermions remain in $1+1$ is also considered. One may refer to this model as
the Pseudo-Schwinger-Thirring model. It is shown that the screening of external
charges occurs for $2+1$ and $3+1$ gauge fields, exactly as it occurs in $1+1$
dimensions, with a radical change of the long distance interaction induced by
the gauge fields. The massive (massless) model continues to exhibit confinement
(screening), signalling that it is the dimensionality of the matter fields, and
not of the gauge fields to determine confinement properties. A computation for
the string tension is presented in perturbation theory. Our conclusion is that
$1+1$ models exhibiting confinement or screening -- massless or massive, in
presence of a topological term or not -- retain their main properties when the
Thirring interaction is added or the gauge fields live in higher dimension.

from) the holographic proposal for entanglement of purification. We check this
relation for various configurations of subregions in AdS${}_3$/CFT${}_2$. These
are disjoint intervals at zero temperature, as well as a single interval and
adjacent intervals at finite temperature. We also find this prescription to

best-fit models are able to reproduce the flux continuum and the main
absorption features in the whole sample. We find that the mass fractions of
IGEs and IMEs show a decreasing trend toward the outer regions of the
atmospheres using density profiles similar to those of deflagration models in
the literature. Oxygen is the only element, which could be dominant at higher
velocities. The stratified abundance structure contradicts the well-mixed
chemical profiles predicted by pure deflagration models. Based on the derived
densities and abundances, a template model atmosphere is created for the SN Iax
class and compared to the observed spectra. Free parameters are the scaling of
the density profile, the velocity shift of the abundance template, and the peak
luminosity. The results of this test support the idea that all SNe Iax can be

supersymmetric completions for all the three possible purely gravitational
curvature-squared terms in six dimensions: Riemann, Ricci, and scalar curvature
squared. A linear combination of these invariants describes the off-shell
completion of the Gauss-Bonnet term, recently presented in arXiv:1706.09330. We
study properties of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet supergravity, which plays a
central role in the effective low-energy description of
$\alpha^\prime$-corrected string theory compactified to six dimensions,
including a detailed analysis of the spectrum about the ${\rm AdS}_3\times {\rm
S}^3$ solution. We also present a novel locally superconformal invariant based
on a higher-derivative action for the linear multiplet. This invariant, which
includes gravitational curvature-squared terms, can be defined both coupled to
the standard-Weyl or dilaton-Weyl multiplet for conformal supergravity. In the
first case, we show how the addition of this invariant to the supersymmetric
Einstein-Hilbert term leads to a dynamically generated cosmological constant
and non-supersymmetric (A)dS$_6$ solutions. In the dilaton-Weyl multiplet, the
new off-shell invariant includes Ricci and scalar curvature-squared terms and
possesses a nontrivial dependence on the dilaton field.

realistic galaxy evolution. Models typically include energy injection from
supernovae as the dominant form of stellar feedback, often in some form of
sub-grid recipe. However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback
(stellar winds or radiation) is necessary in high-resolution simulations of
galaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the
interstellar medium (ISM). Following these processes is computationally
challenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately,
accounting for the local destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed
stars in lieu of a full radiative transfer calculation. In this work we examine
high resolution simulations (1.8~pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed
stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following stellar ionizing
radiation with an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its
importance in regulating star formation and driving outflows in this galaxy. We
find that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate (SFR) by
over a factor of 5, and is necessary to produce the ISM conditions needed for
supernovae to drive significant outflows. We find that a localized
approximation for radiation feedback is sufficient to regulate the SFR on short
timescales, but does not allow significant outflows. Short and long range
radiation effects are both important in driving the evolution of our
low-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy. Generalizing these results to more
massive galaxies would be a valuable avenue of future research.

possibly in a disk-like object. The observed rotational signature around
W3(H2O) E may be due to a disk-like object, an unresolved binary (or multiple)

and derive a gas temperature map with a median temperature of ~165 K across
W3(H2O). We create a Toomre Q map to study the stability of the rotating
structures against gravitational instability. The rotating structures appear to
be Toomre unstable close to their outer boundaries, with a possibility of
further fragmentation in the differentially-rotating core W3(H2O) W. Rapid
cooling in the Toomre-unstable regions supports the fragmentation scenario.

supermassive black hole, outflow along the jets it launches, and uplift by the
buoyant hot bubbles those jets inflate. The entire scenario is therefore
consistent with a galaxy-spanning ""fountain"", wherein cold gas clouds drain

a cooling plume of low-entropy multiphase gas, which may stimulate additional

individual objects, as well as selection and incompleteness effects. We
demonstrate that photometry alone can constrain the WD population's
distributions of temperature, surface gravity and phenomenological type, and
that astrometric information significantly improves determination of the WD
surface gravity distribution. We also discuss the possibility of identifying
unresolved binary WDs using only photometric and astrometric information.

from a semi-classical perspective. This mechanism is motivated by the breaking
of an underlying symmetry which triggers a phase transition that causes the
coupling of the Weinberg operator to become dynamical. Consequently, a lepton
anti-lepton asymmetry arises from the interference of the Weinberg operator at
two different spacetime points. Using this semi-classical approach, we treat
the Higgs as a background field and show a reflection asymmetry between the
leptons and anti-leptons is generated in the vicinity of the bubble wall. We
solve the equations of motion of the lepton and anti-lepton quasiparticles to
obtain the final lepton asymmetry.

Herbig Ae/Be stars with parallaxes in Gaia DR2, we collected their atmospheric
parameters and photometric and extinction values from the literature. To these
data we added near- and mid-infrared photometry, collected H$\alpha$ equivalent
widths and line profiles, and their binarity status. In addition, we developed
a photometric variability indicator from Gaia's DR2 information. We provide
masses, ages, luminosities, distances, variabilities and infrared excesses
homogeneously derived for the most complete sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars to
date. We find that high mass stars have a much smaller infrared excess and have
much lower optical variabilities compared to lower mass stars, with the break
at around 7M$_{\odot}$. H$\alpha$ emission is generally correlated with
infrared excess, with the correlation being stronger for infrared emission at
wavelengths tracing the hot dust closest to the star. The variability indicator
as developed by us shows that $\sim$25% of all Herbig Ae/Be stars are strongly
variable. We observe that the strongly variable objects display doubly peaked
H$\alpha$ line profiles, indicating an edge-on disk. The fraction of strongly
variable Herbig Ae stars is close to that found for A-type UX Ori stars. It had
been suggested that this variability is in most cases due to asymmetric dusty
disk structures seen edge-on. The observation here is in strong support of this
hypothesis. Finally, the difference in dust properties occurs at 7M$_{\odot}$,
while various properties traced at UV/optical wavelengths differ at
3M$_{\odot}$. The latter has been linked to different accretion mechanisms at
work whereas the differing infrared properties and variabilities are related to
different (dust-)disk dispersal mechanisms.

characterized by violent variability, in particular this concerns blazars,

requires a very efficient particle acceleration mechanism. If the environment,
in which such emission is produced, is relativistically magnetized (i.e., that
magnetic energy density dominates even the rest-mass energy density of matter),
then the most natural mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration
is relativistic magnetic reconnection. Basic research into this mechanism is
performed by means of kinetic numerical simulations of various configurations
of collisionless relativistic plasma with the use of the particle-in-cell
algorithm. Such technique allows to investigate the details of particle
acceleration mechanism, including radiative energy losses, and to calculate the
temporal, spatial, spectral and angular distributions of synchrotron and
inverse Compton radiation. The results of these simulations indicate that the
effective variability time scale of the observed radiation can be much shorter
than the light-crossing time scale of the simulated domain.

unchanged for centuries: systematic human observation of natural phenomena is
used to form hypotheses that, when validated through experimentation, are
generalized into established scientific theory. Today, however, we face major
challenges because automated instrumentation and large-scale data acquisition
are generating data sets of such volume and complexity as to defy human
analysis. Radically different scientific approaches are needed, with machine
learning (ML) showing great promise, not least for materials science research.
Hence, given recent advances in ML analysis of synthetic data representing
electronic quantum matter (EQM), the next challenge is for ML to engage
equivalently with experimental data. For example, atomic-scale visualization of
EQM yields arrays of complex electronic structure images, that frequently elude
effective analyses. Here we report development and training of an array of
artificial neural networks (ANN) designed to recognize different types of
hypothesized order hidden in EQM image-arrays. These ANNs are used to analyze
an experimentally-derived EQM image archive from carrier-doped cuprate Mott
insulators. Throughout these noisy and complex data, the ANNs discover the
existence of a lattice-commensurate, four-unit-cell periodic,
translational-symmetry-breaking EQM state. Further, the ANNs find these
phenomena to be unidirectional, revealing a coincident nematic EQM state.
Strong-coupling theories of electronic liquid crystals are congruent with all
these observations.

where both the implemented and physical registers are single-writer, which
means they can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers but only by a
single writer. To strengthen our lower bounds, we let the physical registers be
atomic and we only require the implemented register to be regular. Furthermore,
the lower bounds hold for obstruction-free implementations, which means they
also hold for lock-free and wait-free implementations.
  If $m$ is the number values representable by the large register and $b$ is
the number of values representable by each physical register, our first lower
bound says that any obstruction-free implementation that has an invisible
reader requires at least $\lceil \frac{m-1}{b-1} \rceil$ physical registers. A
reader is considered invisible if it never writes to shared registers. This
lower bound is tight for the invisible reader case. We also prove a $\lceil

almost coincides with the class of quasi-graphic matroids: every quasi-graphic
matroid is biased graphic, and if $M$ is a biased graphic matroid that is not

and quality of service (QoS) information from several neighbors and adapts its
own transmit power accordingly. The objective is to maximize a weighted
sum-rate utility function, which can be particularized to achieve maximum
sum-rate or proportionally fair scheduling. Both random variations and delays
in the CSI are inherently addressed using deep Q-learning. For a typical
network architecture, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve near-optimal
power allocation in real time based on delayed CSI measurements available to
the agents. The proposed scheme is especially suitable for practical scenarios
where the system model is inaccurate and CSI delay is non-negligible.

translation systems has been improved significantly. By exploiting advancements
in deep learning, systems are now able to better approximate the complex
mapping from source sentences to target sentences. But with this ability, new
challenges also arise. An example is the translation of partial sentences in
low-latency speech translation. Since the model has only seen complete
sentences in training, it will always try to generate a complete sentence,
though the input may only be a partial sentence. We show that NMT systems can
be adapted to scenarios where no task-specific training data is available.
Furthermore, this is possible without losing performance on the original
training data. We achieve this by creating artificial data and by using
multi-task learning. After adaptation, we are able to reduce the number of

a certain class of initial states. The latter are thermal (mixed or pure)
states of the model in the presence of an additional static force, but become
non-equilibrium states after a sudden removal of this static force. For this
class and high temperatures, we show that the induced dynamics is given by a
single correlation function at equilibrium, independent of the initial
expectation values being prepared close to equilibrium (by a weak static force)
or far away from equilibrium (by a strong static force). Remarkably, this type
of universality holds true in both, the ergodic phase and the many-body
localized regime. Moreover, it does not depend on the specific choice of a unit
cell for the local density. We particularly discuss two important consequences.
First, the long-time expectation value of the local density is uniquely
determined by the fluctuations of its diagonal matrix elements in the energy
eigenbasis. Thus, the validity of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is
not only a sufficient but also a necessary condition for thermalization.
Second, the real-time broadening of density profiles is always given by the
current autocorrelation function at equilibrium via a generalized Einstein
relation. In the context of transport, we discuss the influence of disorder for
large particle-particle interactions, where normal diffusion is known to occur
in the disorder-free case. Our results suggest that normal diffusion is stable
against weak disorder, while they are consistent with anomalous diffusion for
stronger disorder below the localization transition. Particularly, for weak
disorder, Gaussian density profiles can be observed for single disorder
realizations, which we demonstrate for finite lattices up to 31 sites.

field corresponds to the trajectory of harmonic oscillator with frequency
determined by the value of parameter of momentum noncommutativity and mass of

the rates of the forward and backward chemical reactions converge to the same
value. However, there are atmospheric processes, such as atmospheric transport,
that destabilize this equilibrium. In this work we study the changes in
composition driven by a 3D wind field in WASP-43b using our Global Circulation
Model, THOR. Our model uses validated temperature- and pressure-dependent
chemical timescales that allow us to explore the disequilibrium chemistry of
CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O and CH$_4$. In WASP-43b the formation of the equatorial jet
has an important impact in the chemical distribution of the different species
across the atmosphere. At low latitudes the chemistry is longitudinally
quenched, except for CO$_2$ at solar abundances. The polar vortexes have a
distinct chemical distribution since these are regions with lower temperature
and atmospheric mixing. Vertical and latitudinal mixing have a secondary impact
in the chemical transport. We determine graphically the effect of
disequilibrium on observed emission spectra. Our results do not show any
significant differences in the emission spectra between the equilibrium and
disequilibrium solutions for C/O = 0.5. However, if C/O is increased to 2.0,
differences in the spectra due to the disequilibrium chemistry of CH$_4$ become
non-negligible. In some spectral ranges the emission spectra can have more than
15$\%$ departures from the equilibrium solution.

later than 100 days after maximum light. We present new data for Gaia16apd and
SN2017egm, and analyse these with a larger sample comprising 41 spectra of 12
events. The spectra become nebular within 2-4 $e$-folding times after light
curve peak, with the rate of spectroscopic evolution correlated to the light
curve timescale. Emission lines are identified with well-known transitions of
oxygen, calcium, magnesium, sodium and iron. SLSNe are differentiated from
other Type Ic SNe by a prominent O I $\lambda$7774 line and higher-ionisation
states of oxygen. The iron-dominated region around 5000 \AA\ is more similar to
broad-lined SNe Ic than to normal SNe Ic. Principal Component Analysis shows
that 5 `eigenspectra' capture 75% of the variance, while a clustering analysis
shows no clear evidence for multiple SLSN sub-classes. Line velocities are
5000--8000 km/s, and show stratification of the ejecta. O I $\lambda$7774
likely arises in a dense inner region that also produces calcium emission,
while [O I] $\lambda$6300 comes from further out until 300--400 days. The
luminosities of O I $\lambda$7774 and Ca II suggest significant clumping, in
agreement with previous studies. Ratios of [Ca II]$\lambda$7300/[O
I]$\lambda$6300 favour progenitors with relatively massive helium cores, likely
$\gtrsim 6$ M$_\odot$, though more modelling is required here. SLSNe with broad
light curves show the strongest [O I] $\lambda$6300, suggesting larger ejecta
masses. We show how the inferred velocity, density and ionisation structure
point to a central power source.

diversity over both time and frequency. Moreover, it converts the fading,

constant for all symbols.
  This design obviates the need for transmitter adaptation, and greatly
simplifies system operation. The paper describes the basic operating principles

anticipated standardized systems. OTFS is shown to provide significant
performance improvement in systems with high Doppler, short packets, and/or

of Cooperative Group Optimization (CGO), to show the leveraged optimization
with a mixed individual and social learning. Ant colony is a simple yet
efficient natural system for understanding the effects of primary intelligence
on optimization. However, existing AS algorithms are mostly focusing on their
capability of using social heuristic cues while ignoring their individual
learning. CGO can integrate the advantages of a cooperative group and a
low-level algorithm portfolio design, and the agents of CGO can explore both
individual and social search. In CGO-AS, each ant (agent) is added with an
individual memory, and is implemented with a novel search strategy to use
individual and social cues in a controlled proportion. The presented CGO-AS is
therefore especially useful in exposing the power of the mixed individual and
social learning for improving optimization. The optimization performance is
tested with instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results
prove that a cooperative ant group using both individual and social learning
obtains a better performance than the systems solely using either individual or
social learning. The best performance is achieved under the condition when
agents use individual memory as their primary information source, and
simultaneously use social memory as their searching guidance. In comparison
with existing AS systems, CGO-AS retains a faster learning speed toward those
higher-quality solutions, especially in the later learning cycles. The leverage
in optimization by CGO-AS is highly possible due to its inherent feature of
adaptively maintaining the population diversity in the individual memory of
agents, and of accelerating the learning process with accumulated knowledge in
the social memory.

Consequently, they have become one of the most important mechanisms for social

of information to understand human demographics and human behaviour.
  In this work we combine two sources of information: communication logs from a
major mobile operator in a Latin American country, and information on the
demographics of a subset of the users population. This allows us to perform an
observational study of mobile phone usage, differentiated by age groups
categories. This study is interesting in its own right, since it provides
knowledge on the structure and demographics of the mobile phone market in the
studied country.
  We then tackle the problem of inferring the age group for all users in the
network. We present here an exclusively graph-based inference method relying
solely on the topological structure of the mobile network, together with a
topological analysis of the performance of the algorithm. The equations for our
algorithm can be described as a diffusion process with two added properties:
(i) memory of its initial state, and (ii) the information is propagated as a
probability vector for each node attribute (instead of the value of the
attribute itself). Our algorithm can successfully infer different age groups
within the network population given known values for a subset of nodes (seed
nodes). Most interestingly, we show that by carefully analysing the topological
relationships between correctly predicted nodes and the seed nodes, we can
characterize particular subsets of nodes for which our inference method has

blockchain. Trusted entities called oracles attest to external data in order to
bring it onto the blockchain but they do so without the robust security
guarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn
oracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper
introduces Astraea, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides
the truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and
certifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that is resistant to
adversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role so
they are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also
presents a formal analysis of the parameters behind the system to measure the
probability of an adversary with bounded funds being able to successfully
manipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters can be
set to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult---a desirable feature for the
system. Further, this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash

investigated how this picture relates to one of the most promising approaches
for the emergence of thermal behaviour in isolated quantum systems: the
Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results to study some
equilibrium properties of many-body localised systems. Despite the localization
phenomenon, which prevents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show
that we can still use the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the
equilibrium of some observables. Moreover, the intuition developed in the
process led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel the
interacting nature of many-body localised systems. Second, I exploited the
""Concentration of Measure"" phenomenon to study the macroscopic properties of
the basis states of Loop Quantum Gravity. These techniques were previously used
to explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is such an ubiquitous
phenomenon, at the macroscopic scale. I focused on the local properties, their
thermodynamic behaviour and interplay with the semiclassical limit. This was
motivated by the necessity to understand, from a quantum gravity perspective,
how and why a classical horizon exhibits thermal properties.

Gaussian processes (GPs) capable of discovering structurally complex patterns

quasi-periodical kernel components, the state-of-the-art SM kernel does not
consider component compression and dependency structures between components. In
this paper, we investigate the benefits of component compression and modeling
of both time and phase delay structures between basis components in the SM
kernel. By verifying the presence of dependencies between function components
using Gaussian conditionals and posterior covariance, we first propose a new SM
kernel variant with a time and phase delay dependency structure (SMD) and then
provide a structure adaptation (SA) algorithm for the SMD. The SMD kernel is
constructed in two steps: first, time delay and phase delay are incorporated
into each basis component; next, cross-convolution between a basis component
and the reversed complex conjugate of another basis component is performed,
which yields a complex-valued and positive definite kernel incorporating
dependency structures between basis components. The model compression and
dependency sparsity of the SMD kernel can be obtained by using automatic
pruning in SA. We perform a thorough comparative experimental analysis of the
SMD on both synthetic and real-life datasets. The results corroborate the
efficacy of the dependency structure and SA in the SMD.

and the invariant probability distribution would be given in terms of its
potential function. The quasipotential plays a similar role for nongradient
SDEs. Unfortunately, the quasipotential is the solution of a functional
minimization problem that can be obtained analytically only in some special
cases. We propose a Dijkstra-like solver for computing the quasipotential on
regular rectangular meshes in 3D. This solver results from a promotion and an
upgrade of the previously introduced ordered line integral method with the
midpoint quadrature rule for 2D SDEs. The key innovations that have allowed us
to keep the CPU times reasonable while maintaining good accuracy are $(i)$ a
new hierarchical update strategy, $(ii)$ the use of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory
for rejecting unnecessary simplex updates, and $(iii)$ pruning the number of
admissible simplexes and a fast search for them. An extensive numerical study
is conducted on a series of linear and nonlinear examples where the
quasipotential is analytically available or can be found at transition states
by other methods. In particular, the proposed solver is applied to Tao's
examples where the transition states are hyperbolic periodic orbits, and to a

Waves in the Cosmic Microwave Background requires excellent observational

Keck Array are designed to optimize throughput and minimize losses from
transmission, reflection and scattering at millimeter wavelengths. As aperture
size increases, cryostat vacuum windows must withstand larger forces from
atmospheric pressure and the solution has often led to a thicker window at the
expense of larger transmission loss. We have identified a new candidate
material for the fabrication of vacuum windows: with a tensile strength two
orders of magnitude larger than previously used materials, woven high-modulus
polyethylene could allow for dramatically thinner windows, and therefore
significantly reduced losses and higher sensitivity. In these proceedings we
investigate the suitability of high-modulus polyethylene windows for
ground-based CMB experiments, such as current and future receivers in the
Bicep/Keck Array program. This includes characterizing their optical
transmission as well as their mechanical behavior under atmospheric pressure.
We find that such ultra-thin materials are promising candidates to improve the
performance of large-aperture instruments at millimeter wavelengths, and
outline a plan for further tests ahead of a possible upcoming field deployment
of such a science-grade window.

We designed corrugations in the metal frame of the module to suppress unwanted

beams of edge pixels. This design reduces the residual beam systematics and
temperature-to-polarization leakage due to beam steering and shape mismatch
between polarized beam pairs. We report on the simulated performance of single-
and wide-band corrugations designed to minimize these effects. Our optimized
design alleviates beam differential ellipticity caused by the metal frame to
about 7% over 57% bandwidth (25 to 45 GHz), which is close to the level due the
bare antenna itself without a metal frame. Initial laboratory measurements are
also presented.

with a wealth of planetary candidates that orbit stars typically much brighter
than the targets of the original mission. These planet candidates are suitable
for further spectroscopic follow-up and precise mass determinations, leading
ultimately to the construction of empirical mass-radius diagrams. Particularly
interesting is to constrain the properties of planets between the Earth and
Neptune in size, the most abundant type of planets orbiting Sun-like stars with
periods less than a few years. Among many other K2 candidates, we discovered a
multi-planetary system around EPIC246471491, with four planets ranging in size
from twice the size of Earth, to nearly the size of Neptune. We measure the
mass of the planets of the EPIC246471491 system by means of precise radial
velocity measurements using the CARMENES spectrograph and the HARPS-N
spectrograph. With our data we are able to determine the mass of the two inner
planets of the system with a precision better than 15%, and place upper limits
on the masses of the two outer planets. We find that EPIC246471491b has a mass
of 9.68 Me, and a radius of 2.59 Re, yielding a mean density of 3.07 g/cm3,
while EPIC246471491c has a mass of 15.68 Me, radius of 3.53 Re, and a mean
density of 19.5 g/cm3. For EPIC246471491d (R=2.48Re) and EPIC246471491e
(R=1.95Re) the upper limits for the masses are 6.5 and 10.7 Me, respectively.
The system is thus composed of a nearly Neptune-twin planet (in mass and
radius), two sub-Neptunes with very different densities and presumably bulk
composition, and a fourth planet in the outermost orbit that resides right in
the middle of the super-Earth/sub-Neptune radius gap. Future comparative
planetology studies of this system can provide useful insights into planetary
formation, and also a good test of atmospheric escape and evolution theories.

are complicated by the fact that any particular galaxy's appearance depends in
part on the rest-frame wavelength of the observation. This leads to the
necessity for a ""morphological k-correction"" between different pass-bands,
especially when comparing the rest-frame optical or infrared (IR) to the
ultraviolet (UV). This is of particular concern for high redshift studies that
are conducted in the rest-frame UV. We investigate the effects of this
""band-pass shifting"" out of the UV by quantifying nearby galaxy structure via
""CAS parameters"" (concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness). For this study we
combine pan-chromatic data from the UV through the near-IR with GALEX (Galaxy
Evolution Explorer) data of 2073 nearby galaxies in the ""NUV"" (~230 nm) and
1127 in the ""FUV"" (~150 nm), providing the largest study of this kind in the
mid- to far-UV. We find a relationship between the CAS parameters and observed
rest-frame wavelength that make galaxies appear more late-type at shorter
wavelengths, particularly in the UV. The effect is strongest for E/S0 galaxies
in the far-UV, which have concentrations and asymmetries that more resemble
those of spiral and peculiar/merging galaxies in the optical. This may be
explained by extended disks containing recent star formation. Here we also
release the CAS values of the galaxies imaged in GALEX NUV and FUV for use in
comparisons with deep HST imaging and JWST in the future.

the net solar and internal energy fluxes against the net thermal radiative and

atmosphere is non-scattering at thermal wavelengths and that opacities are grey
at these same wavelengths. Additionally, we adopt an atmospheric thermal

power law relationship between grey thermal optical depth and atmospheric
pressure. To verify the accuracy of our analytic treatment, we compare our
model to more sophisticated full physics tools as applied to Venus, Earth, and
a cloudfree Jupiter, thereby exploring a diversity of atmospheric conditions
conditions. Next, we seek to better understand our analytic model by exploring
how thermal radiative flux profiles respond to variations in key physical
parameters, such as the total grey thermal optical depth of the atmosphere.
Using energy balance arguments, we derive convective flux pro-files for the
tropospheres of all Solar System worlds with thick atmospheres, and propose a
scaling that enables inter-comparison of these profiles. Lastly, we use our
analytic treatment to discuss the validity of other simple models of convective
fluxes in planetary atmospheres. Our new expressions build on decades of
analytic modeling exercises in planetary atmospheres, and further prove the
utility of simple, generalized tools in comparative planetology studies.

seriously degrades the achievable rate of HB-NOMA. In this paper, first a

for both perfect and imperfect correlation. Finally, the rate gap resulting

is to start with a probability measure-preserving (p.m.p.) action $\Gamma
\curvearrowright (X, \mu)$ and a map $f \in L^1(X, \mu)$, and to compare the
global average $\int f \,\mathrm{d}\mu$ of $f$ to the pointwise averages
$|D|^{-1} \sum_{\delta \in D} f(\delta \cdot x)$, where $x \in X$ and $D$ is a
nonempty finite subset of $\Gamma$. The basic hope is that, when $D$ runs over
a suitably chosen infinite sequence, these pointwise averages should converge
to the global value for $\mu$-almost all $x$.
  In this paper we prove several results that refine the above basic paradigm
by uniformly controlling the averages over specific sets $D$ rather than
considering their limit as $|D| \to \infty$. Our results include ergodic
theorems for the Bernoulli shift action $\Gamma \curvearrowright ([0;1]^\Gamma,

indices of 43 BL Lac objects from the literature. Based on a simple math model,
$\Delta\Gamma_{obs}=\alpha {\rm{z}}+\beta $, we present evidence for the origin
of an observed spectral break that is denoted by the difference between the
observed very-high-energy and high-energy spectral indices,
$\Delta\Gamma_{obs}$. We find by linear regression analysis that $\alpha\ne 0$
and $\beta\ne 0$. These results suggest that the extragalactic background light
attenuation and the intrinsic curvature dominate on the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray
energy spectral break of BL Lac objects. We argue that the extragalactic
background light attenuation is an exclusive explanation for the redshift
evolution of the observed spectral break.

they may evolve organically through accretion, but their configurations and
orientations help define a city's spatial logic and order. Measures of entropy
reveal a city's streets' order and disorder. Past studies have explored
individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader
patterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation,
configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap
data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and
unweighted network models, along with each city's typical street segment
length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network's proportions of
four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of
orientation-order that quantifies how a city's street network follows the
geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to
explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple
dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city
orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street
circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are
far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity.
These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the
grid. These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to
empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating complex
urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.

between Jupiter and one or more ice giants ('Jumping Jupiter' -- JJ). We show
that, when Jupiter temporarily reaches a high enough level of excitation, both
in eccentricity and inclination it induces strong forced vectors of
eccentricity and inclination across the MB region. Because during the JJ
instability Jupiter's orbit `jumps' around, the forced vectors keep changing
both in magnitude and phase throughout the whole MB region. The entire cold
primordial MB is thus excited as a natural outcome of the JJ instability. The
level of such an excitation, however, is typically larger than the current
orbital excitation observed in the MB. We show that the subsequent evolution of
the Solar System is capable of reshaping the resultant over-excited MB to its
present day orbital state, and that a strong mass depletion ($\sim$90$\%$) is
associated to the JJ instability phase and its subsequent evolution throughout
the age of the Solar System.

assessment (ISA) techniques have emerged as the standard of image quality
assessment in diverse imaging applications. Despite their high correlation with
subjective scoring, they are challenging for practical considerations due to
high computational cost and lack of scalability across different image blurs.
We bridge this gap by synthesizing the HVS response as a linear combination of
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) derivative filters to boost the falloff of high
band frequency magnitudes in natural imaging paradigm. The numerical
implementation of the HVS filter is carried out with MaxPol filter library that
can be arbitrarily set for any differential orders and cutoff frequencies to
balance out the estimation of informative features and noise sensitivities. We
then design an innovative NR-ISA metric called `HVS-MaxPol' that (a) requires
minimal computational cost, (b) produce high correlation accuracy with image
blurriness, and (c) scales to assess synthetic and natural image blur.
Specifically, the synthetic blur images are constructed by blurring the raw
images using Gaussian filter, while natural blur is observed from real-life
application such as motion, out-of-focus, etc. Furthermore, we create a natural
benchmark database in digital pathology for validation of image focus quality
in whole slide imaging systems called `FocusPath' consisting of 864 blurred

of HVS-MaxPol across different blur databases and state-of-the-art NR-ISA

and investigate the origin of these dusty shells. Herschel, in particular, has
revealed the first ever bow shock associated with an RCB star with its
observations of SU Tauri. These data have allowed the assembly of the most
comprehensive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these stars with
multi--wavelength data from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter. Radiative
transfer modeling of the SEDs implies that the RCB stars in this sample are
surrounded by an inner warm (up to 1,200 K) and an outer cold (up to 200 K)
envelope. The outer shells are suggested to contain up to 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$
of dust and have existed for up to $10^5$ yr depending on the expansion rate of
the dust. This age limit indicates that these structures have most likely been
formed during the RCB phase.

output an infinite (though typically periodic) tour that visits the n points
repeatedly, such that no point goes unvisited for ""too long."" More
specifically, we consider two objective functions for each point x. The maximum
objective is simply the maximum duration of any absence from x, while the
quadratic objective is the normalized sum of squares of absence lengths from x.
For periodic tours, the quadratic objective captures the expected duration of
absence from x at a uniformly random point in time during the tour. The overall
objective is then the weighted maximum of the individual points' objectives.
When a point has weight w_x, the absences under an optimal tour should be
roughly a 1/w_x fraction of the absences from points of weight 1. Thus, the
objective naturally encourages visiting high-weight points more frequently, and
at roughly evenly spaced intervals.
  We give a polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm whose output is
simultaneously an O(log n) approximation under both objectives. We prove that
up to constant factors, approximation guarantees for the quadratic objective
directly imply the same guarantees for a natural security patrol game defined

our extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data show that our

energy in the radiation spectrum, $t+t_0$ is the observer time relative to the

with energy $E$ with respect to the energy band $8$-$25$ keV. For H2S and
H2S-dominated-tracking pulses, a weak correlation between $k_{{\hat{\tau}}}/W$
and $k_E$ is found, where $W$ is the pulse width. We also study the spectral
lag behavior with peak time $t_{\rm p_E}$ of pulses for 30 well-shaped pulses

p_E}\propto k_{t_p}\log E$. It is found that $k_{t_p}$ is correlated with
$k_E$. We perform simulations under a phenomenological model of spectral
evolution, and find that these correlations are reproduced. We then conclude
that spectral lags are closely related to spectral evolution within the pulse.
The most natural explanation of these observations is that the emission is from
the electrons in the same fluid unit at an emission site moving away from the
central engine, as expected in the models invoking magnetic dissipation in a

formed via mutual, inelastic collisions of spherical particles due to adhering
forces between particles in granular streams. To investigate the condition of
agglomerate formation in granular streams, we conducted laboratory experiments
of granular streams using both spherical and irregular, non-spherical
particles. Measurements of particle adhesion in this study were performed using
a centrifugal separation method, in contrast to the previous study in which
atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used. This enabled simultaneous measurements
of multiple particles of various shapes for a statistical analysis of the
results. With similar relative velocities and adhesion values, irregular
particles were found to form agglomerates much more easily than spherical
particles. The axial ratio of the agglomerates of spherical particles and
irregular particles was similar and was in accordance with those observed in
previous laboratory studies, whereas the size of the agglomerates of irregular
particles was larger than the size of spherical particles. The degree of
agglomeration and the size of agglomerates can be used as an indicator of the
shape or adhesive force of the particles in granular stream. Our findings on

  Authentication Systems Leveraging Mobile Devices",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Implicit authentication (IA) is gaining popularity over recent years due to
its use of user behavior as the main input, relieving users from explicit
actions such as remembering and entering passwords. However, such convenience
comes with a cost of authentication accuracy and delay which we propose to
improve in this paper. Authentication accuracy deteriorates as users' behaviors
change as a result of mood, age, a change of routine, etc. Current
authentication systems handle failed authentication attempts by locking the
users out of their mobile devices. It is unsuitable for IA whose accuracy
deterioration induces a high false reject rate, rendering the IA system
unusable. Furthermore, existing IA systems leverage computationally expensive
machine learning, which can introduce a large authentication delay. It is
challenging to improve the authentication accuracy of these systems without
sacrificing authentication delay. In this paper, we propose a multi-level
privilege control (MPC) scheme that dynamically adjusts users' access privilege
based on their behavior change. MPC increases the system's confidence in users'
legitimacy even when their behaviors deviate from historical data, thus
improving authentication accuracy. It is a lightweight feature added to the
existing IA schemes that helps avoid frequent and expensive retraining of
machine learning models, thus improving authentication delay. We demonstrate
that MPC increases authentication accuracy by 18.63\% and reduces
authentication delay by 7.02 minutes on average, using a public dataset that
contains comprehensive user behavior data.

the difficulty of getting competing sequence hypotheses. The few studies on
sequence discriminative training for KWS are limited for fixed vocabulary or
LVCSR based methods and have not been compared to the state-of-the-art deep
learning based KWS approaches. In this paper, a sequence discriminative

introducing word-independent phone lattices or non-keyword blank symbols to
construct competing hypotheses, feasible and efficient sequence discriminative

  Optimization Approach","Presented at WAFR 2018; final version v2 -- fixed typos",,,,"cs.SY cs.RO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the pursuit of real-time motion planning, a commonly adopted practice is
to compute a trajectory by running a planning algorithm on a simplified,
low-dimensional dynamical model, and then employ a feedback tracking controller
that tracks such a trajectory by accounting for the full, high-dimensional
system dynamics. While this strategy of planning with model mismatch generally
yields fast computation times, there are no guarantees of dynamic feasibility,
which hampers application to safety-critical systems. Building upon recent work
that addressed this problem through the lens of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
reachability, we devise an algorithmic framework whereby one computes, offline,
for a pair of ""planner"" (i.e., low-dimensional) and ""tracking"" (i.e.,
high-dimensional) models, a feedback tracking controller and associated
tracking bound. This bound is then used as a safety margin when generating
motion plans via the low-dimensional model. Specifically, we harness the
computational tool of sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to design a bilinear
optimization algorithm for the computation of the feedback tracking controller
and associated tracking bound. The algorithm is demonstrated via numerical
experiments, with an emphasis on investigating the trade-off between the
increased computational scalability afforded by SOS and its intrinsic
conservativeness. Collectively, our results enable scaling the appealing
strategy of planning with model mismatch to systems that are beyond the reach
of HJ analysis, while maintaining safety guarantees.

static images, this paper makes the first attempt to investigate a more
realistic video instance-level human parsing that simultaneously segments out
each person instance and parses each instance into more fine-grained parts
(e.g., head, leg, dress). We introduce a novel Adaptive Temporal Encoding
Network (ATEN) that alternatively performs temporal encoding among key frames
and flow-guided feature propagation from other consecutive frames between two
key frames. Specifically, ATEN first incorporates a Parsing-RCNN to produce the
instance-level parsing result for each key frame, which integrates both the
global human parsing and instance-level human segmentation into a unified
model. To balance between accuracy and efficiency, the flow-guided feature
propagation is used to directly parse consecutive frames according to their
identified temporal consistency with key frames. On the other hand, ATEN
leverages the convolution gated recurrent units (convGRU) to exploit temporal
changes over a series of key frames, which are further used to facilitate the
frame-level instance-level parsing. By alternatively performing direct feature
propagation between consistent frames and temporal encoding network among key
frames, our ATEN achieves a good balance between frame-level accuracy and time
efficiency, which is a common crucial problem in video object segmentation
research. To demonstrate the superiority of our ATEN, extensive experiments are
conducted on the most popular video segmentation benchmark (DAVIS) and a newly
collected Video Instance-level Parsing (VIP) dataset, which is the first video
instance-level human parsing dataset comprised of 404 sequences and over 20k
frames with instance-level and pixel-wise annotations.

redundancy. This means that fewer parameters or parameter combination can be

independent component analysis (ICA) has been used for blind source separation
(BSS). However, it remains unclear why these linear methods work well with
real-world data that involve nonlinear source mixtures. This work theoretically
validates that a cascade of linear PCA and ICA can solve a nonlinear BSS
problem accurately -- when the sensory inputs are generated from hidden sources
via nonlinear mappings with sufficient dimensionality. Our proposed theorem,
termed the asymptotic linearization theorem, theoretically guarantees that
applying linear PCA to the inputs can reliably extract a subspace spanned by
the linear projections from every hidden source as the major components -- and
thus projecting the inputs onto their major eigenspace can effectively recover
a linear transformation of the hidden sources. Then, subsequent application of
linear ICA can separate all the true independent hidden sources accurately.
Zero-element-wise-error nonlinear BSS is asymptotically attained when the
source dimensionality is large and the input dimensionality is sufficiently
larger than the source dimensionality. Our proposed theorem is validated
analytically and numerically. Moreover, the same computation can be performed
by using Hebbian-like plasticity rules, implying the biological plausibility of
this nonlinear BSS strategy. Our results highlight the utility of linear PCA
and ICA for accurately and reliably recovering nonlinearly mixed sources -- and
further suggest the importance of employing sensors with sufficient
dimensionality to identify true hidden sources of real-world data.

to the strings and influence their evolution, leading to the formation of
black-hole-string networks and commonly to the suppression of loop production
in a range of redshifts. Subsequently, reconnections within the network give
rise to small nets made of several black holes and connecting strings. The
number of black holes in the network as well as the stability of the nets
depend on the topological properties of the strings. The nets oscillate and
shrink exponentially due to the emission of gravitational waves. This leads to
potentially observable string-driven mergers of PBHs. The strings can keep PBHs

applications, such as robot navigation, autonomous driving, virtual and

state estimation in recent years. Time instants at which different sensors'
measurements are recorded are of crucial importance to the system's robustness
and accuracy. In practice, timestamps of each sensor typically suffer from
triggering and transmission delays, leading to temporal misalignment (time
offsets) among different sensors. Such temporal offset dramatically influences
the performance of sensor fusion. To this end, we propose an online approach
for calibrating temporal offset between visual and inertial measurements. Our
approach achieves temporal offset calibration by jointly optimizing time
offset, camera and IMU states, as well as feature locations in a SLAM system.
Furthermore, the approach is a general model, which can be easily employed in
several feature-based optimization frameworks. Simulation and experimental
results demonstrate the high accuracy of our calibration approach even compared
with other state-of-art offline tools. The VIO comparison against other methods
proves that the online temporal calibration significantly benefits

isotherm and can influence the dynamic viscosity of the solution. In the
absence of any viscosity variation, the Langmuir adsorption induces the
formation of a shock layer wave at the frontal interface and of a rarefaction
wave at the rear interface of the sample. For a finite width sample, these
waves interact after a given time that varies nonlinearly with the adsorption
properties to give a triangle-like concentration profile in which the mixing
efficiency of the solute is larger in comparison to the linear or no-adsorption
cases. In the presence of a viscosity contrast such that a less viscous carrier
fluid displaces the more viscous finite slice, viscous fingers are formed at
the rear rarefaction interface. The fingers propagate through the finite sample
to preempt the shock layer at the viscously stable front. In the reverse case
i.e. when the shock layer front features viscous fingering, the fingers are
unable to intrude through the rarefaction zone and the qualitative properties
of the expanding rear wave are preserved. A non-monotonic dependence with
respect to the Langmuir adsorption parameter $b$ is observed in the onset time
of interaction between the nonlinear waves and viscous fingering. The coupled
effect of viscous fingering at the rear interface and of Langmuir adsorption
provides a powerful mechanism to enhance the mixing efficiency of the adsorbed
solute.

positive (negative) below (above) the PL peak and it changes sign within a
narrow band of energy lying between excitonic absorption and emission peaks.
The energy at which this sign change takes place is interpreted as the
excitonic mobility edge as it separates localized excitons in quantum dot-like
states from mobile excitons in quantum well-like states.

graphs. Importantly, when the node and edge coordinates are not accessible, it
becomes impossible to evaluate the graph layouts quantitatively. In this paper,
we present a novel deep learning-based approach to evaluate the readability of
graph layouts by directly using graph images. A convolutional neural network
architecture is proposed and trained on a benchmark dataset of graph images,
which is composed of synthetically-generated graphs and graphs created by
sampling from real large networks. Multiple representative readability metrics
(including edge crossing, node spread, and group overlap) are considered in the
proposed approach. We quantitatively compare our approach to traditional

visualizing convolutional layers. This work is a first step towards using deep
learning based methods to evaluate images from the visualization field

0.2-0.3 Myr, which is comparable to the estimated dynamical age of the HII

observed molecular outflows from young stellar objects and the observational

established the analogue of a theorem of Ku. Nishioka for linear Mahler systems

refinement of this theorem. Let $f_{1}(z),\ldots f_{n}(z)$ be $d$-Mahler
functions such that $\overline{\mathbb{K}}(z)\left(f_{1}(z),\ldots,
f_{n}(z)\right)$ is a regular extension over $\overline{\mathbb{K}}(z)$. Then,
every homogeneous algebraic relation over $\overline{\mathbb{K}}$ between their
values at a regular algebraic point arises as the specialization of a
homogeneous algebraic relation over $\overline{\mathbb{K}}(z)$ between these
functions themselves. If $\mathbb{K}$ is replaced by a number field, this
result is due to B. Adamczewski and C. Faverjon, as a consequence of a theorem
of P. Philippon. The main difference is that in characteristic zero, every
$d$-Mahler extension is regular, whereas, in characteristic $p$, non-regular
$d$-Mahler extensions do exist. Furthermore, we prove that the regularity of
the field extension $\overline{\mathbb{K}}(z)\left(f_{1}(z),\ldots,

present a large-scale comparison of penalized regression methods. We
distinguish between three related goals: prediction, variable selection and
variable ranking. Our results span more than 2,300 data-generating scenarios,
including both synthetic and semi-synthetic data (real covariates and simulated
responses), allowing us to systematically consider the influence of various
factors (sample size, dimensionality, sparsity, signal strength and
multicollinearity). We consider several widely-used approaches (Lasso, Adaptive
Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge Regression, SCAD, the Dantzig Selector and Stability
Selection). We find considerable variation in performance between methods. Our
results support a `no panacea' view, with no unambiguous winner across all
scenarios or goals, even in this restricted setting where all data align well
with the assumptions underlying the methods. The study allows us to make some
recommendations as to which approaches may be most (or least) suitable given

challenging problem. In this work, this problem is tackled by minimizing the
sum of a non convex least-squares fit criterion and a penalty term. We assume
that the nonlinearity of the model can be accounted for by a rational function.
In addition, we suppose that the signal to be sought is sparse and a rational
approximation of the $\ell_0$ pseudo-norm thus constitutes a suitable
penalization. The resulting composite cost function belongs to the broad class
of semi-algebraic functions. To find a globally optimal solution to such an
optimization problem, it can be transformed into a generalized moment problem,
for which a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations can be built.
Global optimality comes at the expense of an increased dimension and, to
overcome computational limitations concerning the number of involved variables,
the structure of the problem has to be carefully addressed. A situation of
practical interest is when the nonlinear model consists of a convolutive
transform followed by a componentwise nonlinear rational saturation. We then
propose to use a sparse relaxation able to deal with up to several hundreds of
optimized variables. In contrast with the naive approach consisting of
linearizing the model, our experiments show that the proposed approach offers
good performance.

application of a unitary perturbation after a fixed time with no jumps, the
system was prevented from getting shelved in the dark state, thus removing the
intermittency from the dynamics. Here we offer an interpretation of this
phenomenon in terms of the dynamical large deviation formalism for open quantum
dynamics. In this approach, intermittency is seen as the first-order
coexistence of active and inactive dynamical phases. Dark periods are thus like
space-time bubbles of the inactive phase in the active one. Here we consider a
controlled dynamics via the (single - as in the experiment - or multiple)
application of a unitary control pulse during no-jump periods. By considering
the large deviation statistics of the emissions, we show that appropriate
choice of the control allows to stabilise a desired dynamical phase and remove
the intermittency. In the thermodynamic analogy, the effect of the control is
to prick bubbles thus preventing the fluctuations that manifest phase
coexistence. We discuss similar controlled dynamics in broader settings.

are also satisfactorily recovered with the 1 sigma aperture, which is the
empirical equivalent of an infinite aperture. These results confirm that in the

by applying the adaptive self-supervision scheme to derive the essential
contour, which acted as a complement with the global shape. The discriminative
contour, shape, and deep features were internally merged for the segmentation
results. Results and Conclusion: 160 abdominal CT images were used for training

performed through an eight-fold cross-validation. The result showed that the

LANER displays a standard laser behavior: when the gain provided by the active
sections is high enough to overcome the losses a coherent emission is produced,
with a complicated intensity spectrum reflecting the structure of the network.
A simple linear theoretical description is introduced and discussed, showing
how the LANER can be considered as a generalization of the laser for a
complicated cavity represented by the network itself. The system can be mapped
to directed graphs and permits to disclosure the analogies with the problem of
quantum chaos on graphs. In the case the links are all integer multiples of the

studies of collective macroscopic quantum phenomena in a solid state system.
Shaping of polariton flow and polariton confinement via potential landscapes
created by nonresonant optical pumping has gained considerable attention due to
the degree of flexibility and control offered by optically-induced potentials.
Recently, large density-dependent energy shifts (blueshifts) exhibited by
optically trapped polaritons at low densities, below the bosonic condensation
threshold, were interpreted as an evidence of strong polariton-polariton
interactions [Nat. Phys. 13, 870 (2017)]. In this work, we further investigate
the origins of these blueshifts in optically-induced circular traps and present
evidence of significant blueshift of the polariton energy due to reshaping of
the optically-induced potential with laser pump power. Our work demonstrates
strong influence of the effective potential formed by an optically-injected
excitonic reservoir on the energy blueshifts observed below and up to the
polariton condensation threshold and suggests that the observed blueshifts
arise due to interaction of polaritons with the excitonic reservoir, rather
than due to polariton-polariton interaction.

central role in quantum information science. This essential property of the
quantum states could be fragile under the influence of the quantum operations.
The extent to which quantum coherence is diminished depends both on the channel
and the incoherent basis. Motivated by this, we propose a measure of
nonclassicality of a quantum channel as the average quantum coherence of the
state space after the channel acts on, minimized over all orthonormal basis
sets of the state space. Utilizing the squared $l_1$-norm of coherence for the
qubit channels, the minimization can be treated analytically and the proposed
measure takes a closed form of expression. If we allow the channels to act
locally on a maximally entangled state, the quantum correlation is diminished
making the states more classical. We show that the extent to which quantum
correlation is preserved under local action of the channel cannot exceed the
quantumness of the underlying channel. We further apply our measure to the
quantum teleportation protocol and show that a nonzero quantumness for the
underlying channel provides a necessary condition to overcome the best
classical protocols.

This view implies that stable memories correspond to stable connectivity
patterns. However, an increasing body of experimental evidence points to
significant, activity-independent dynamics in synaptic strengths. Motivated by
these observations, we explore the possibility of memory storage within a
global component of network connectivity, while individual connections
fluctuate. We find a simple and general principle, stemming from stability
arguments, that links eigenvalues in the complex plane to memories.
Specifically, imaginary-coded memories are more resilient to noise and
homeostatic plasticity than their real-coded counterparts. Memory
representations are stored as time-varying attractors in neural state-space and
support associative retrieval of learned information. Our results suggest a
link between the properties of learning rules and those of network-level memory
representations, and point at measurable signatures to be sought in

position angle. The latter includes a fast ($<$5d) 90-degree rotation event.
Our best estimate of the time delay is $146\pm6$d (1$\sigma$), considerably
longer than that predicted by the lens model presented in the discovery paper.
Additional model constraints will be needed before this system can be used to
measure $H_0$, for example through a detection of the lensed source's VLBI jet

completely observe it. We present a system that incrementally builds a database
of objects as a mobile agent traverses a scene. Our approach requires no prior
knowledge of the shapes present in the scene. Object-like segments are
extracted from a global segmentation map, which is built online using the input
of segmented RGB-D images. These segments are stored in a database, matched
among each other, and merged with other previously observed instances. This
allows us to create and improve object models on the fly and to use these
merged models to reconstruct also unobserved parts of the scene. The database
contains each (potentially merged) object model only once, together with a set
of poses where it was observed. We evaluate our pipeline with one public
dataset, and on a newly created Google Tango dataset containing four indoor
scenes with some of the objects appearing multiple times, both within and
across scenes.

reproduced by introducing in input a temporal sequence of phase screens:
synthetic images are then generated by co-adding instantaneous PSFs. This

higher electric fields at streamer tips. The test-particle simulation shows,
however, that these thermal runaway electrons have insufficient energies to
become relativistic runaways. The simulations are done in constant uniform

gives an alternative proof of Weil and Kodaira's original theorem. Then, we
prove some decomposition theorems for closed meromorphic $1$-forms by applying
the above general theorem. In the second part of the paper, we turn to the

Thus, in this paper we target to demonstrate the importance of activation

functions might be meaningful. To avoid the manual design or selection of
activation functions, we build on the idea of genetic algorithms to learn the
best activation function for a given task. In addition, we introduce two new

associated electric currents are developed in significantly different ways.
This is not a direct comparison of the coronal modelling techniques, in that
the different models also use different photospheric boundary conditions,
reflecting the range of approaches currently used in the community. Despite the
significant differences, the results show broad agreement in the overall
magnetic topology. Among those models with significant volume currents in much
of the corona, there is general agreement that the ratio of total to potential
magnetic energy should be approximately 1.4. However, there are significant
differences in the electric current distributions; while static extrapolations
are best able to reproduce active regions, they are unable to recover sheared
magnetic fields in filament channels using currently available vector
magnetogram data. By contrast, time-evolving simulations can recover the
filament channel fields at the expense of not matching the observed vector
magnetic fields within active regions. We suggest that, at present, the best
approach may be a hybrid model using static extrapolations but with additional
energization informed by simplified evolution models. This is demonstrated by
one of the models.

that, for a given solution $u$ to the Klein-Gordon equation, there are smooth
functions $u_{i}$, $i=0,1$, on the Lie group under consideration, such that
$u_{\sigma}(\cdot,\sigma)-u_{1}$ and $u(\cdot,\sigma)-u_{1}\sigma-u_{0}$
asymptotically converge to zero in the direction of the singularity (where
$\sigma$ is a geometrically defined time coordinate such that the singularity
corresponds to $\sigma\rightarrow-\infty$). Here $u_{i}$, $i=0,1$, should be
thought of as data on the singularity. Interestingly, it is possible to prove
that the asymptotics are of this form for a large class of Bianchi spacetimes.
Moreover, the conclusion applies for singularities that are matter dominated;
singularities that are vacuum dominated; and even when the asymptotics of the
underlying Bianchi spacetime are oscillatory. To summarise, there seems to be a
universality as far as the asymptotics in the direction of silent singularities
are concerned. In fact, it is tempting to conjecture that as long as the
singularity of the underlying Bianchi spacetime is silent, then the asymptotics
of solutions are as described above. In order to contrast the above asymptotics
with the non-silent setting, we, by appealing to known results, provide a
complete asymptotic characterisation of solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation
on a flat Kasner background. In that setting, $u_{\sigma}$ does, generically,
not converge.

Specifically, we are interested in determining a) the fleet size and initial
allocation of vehicles to stations and b) the minimum capacity of each station
needed to guarantee that a) every customer will find an available vehicle at
the origin station and b) the customer will find a free parking spot at the

size of fleet, initial distribution of vehicles to stations, and station
capacities that are sufficient to achieve the desired service level. The

us to map the fluctuations of the valence color sources in the colliding nuclei
to those of the energy-momentum tensor of the produced gluon fields via the
solution of the classical equations of motion in the presence of external

Gaussian correlations, albeit in more generality than in the

transverse dependence of the two-point correlator. We compare our results to
those obtained under the Glasma Graph approximation, finding agreement in the
limit of short transverse separations. However, important differences arise at
larger transverse separations, where our result displays a slower fall-off than
the Glasma Graph result ($r^{-2}$ vs $r^{-4}$ power-law decay), indicating that
the color screening of the correlations in the transverse plane occurs at
distances larger than $1/Q_s$ by a logarithmic factor sensitive to the
infrared. In the Glasma flux tube picture, this implies that the color domains

to understand the factors that cause it. While in most available descriptions
space plays an essential role, one outstanding question is whether and how this
phenomenon is possible in a well-mixed social network. We define and solve a
simple model of segregation on networks based on discrete convictions. In our
model, space does not play a role, and individuals never change their
conviction, but they may choose to connect socially to other individuals based
on two criteria: sharing the same conviction, and individual popularity
(regardless of conviction). The trade-off between these two moves defines a
parameter, analogous to the ""tolerance"" parameter in classical models of
spatial segregation. We show numerically and analytically that this parameter
determines a true phase transition (somewhat reminiscent of phase separation in
a binary mixture) between a well-mixed and a segregated state. Additionally,
minority convictions segregate faster and inter-specific aversion alone may
lead to a segregation threshold with similar properties. Together, our results
highlight the general principle that a segregation transition is possible in
absence of spatial degrees of freedom, provided that conviction-based rewiring
occurs on the same time scale of popularity rewirings.

and its front exhibit broadband fluctuations, or ripples. Shock surface
fluctuations have been object of many observational and theoretical studies,
and are known to be important for electron acceleration. We employ a
combination of hybrid Particle-In-Cell and test-particle methods to study how
shock surface fluctuations influence the acceleration of suprathermal electrons
in fully three dimensional simulations, and we give a complete comparison for
the 2D and 3D cases. A range of different quasi-perpendicular shocks in 2D and
3D is examined, over a range of parameters compatible with the ones observed in
the solar wind. Initial electron velocity distributions are taken as kappa
functions, consistent with solar wind \emph{in-situ} measurements. Electron
acceleration is found to be enhanced in the supercritical regime compared to
subcritical. When the fully three-dimensional structure of the shock front is
resolved, slightly larger energisation for the electrons is observed, and we
suggest that this is due to the possibility for the electrons to interact with
more than one surface fluctuation per interaction. In the supecritical regime,
efficient electron energisation is found also at shock geometries departing
from $\theta_{Bn}$ very close to 90$^\circ$. Two dimensional simulations show
indications of unrealistic electron trapping, leading to slightly higher
energisation in the subcritical cases.

paramagnetic at low magnetic fields. In particular, we predict that the
zero-field susceptibility follows a Curie-type law for small nanoparticle sizes
and/or low temperatures. The calculated field-dependent magnetization of an

The absorber's reflectivity is measured from 63 GHz to 115 GHz and from 140 GHz

  Stores: A Case Study","submission to ICDCN 2018",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we focus on the implementation of distributed programs in
using a key-value store where the state of the nodes is stored in a replicated
and partitioned data store to improve performance and reliability. Applications
of such algorithms occur in weather monitoring, social media, etc. We argue
that these applications should be designed to be stabilizing so that they
recover from an arbitrary state to a legitimate state. Specifically, if we use
a stabilizing algorithm then we can work with more efficient implementations
that provide eventual consistency rather than sequential consistency where the
data store behaves as if there is just one copy of the data. We find that,
although the use of eventual consistency results in consistency violation
faults (cvf) where some node executes its action incorrectly because it relies
on an older version of the data, the overall performance of the resulting
protocol is better. We use experimental analysis to evaluate the expected
improvement. We also identify other variations of stabilization that can
provide additional guarantees in the presence of eventual consistency.Finally,
we note that if the underlying algorithm is not stabilizing, even a single \cvf
may cause the algorithm to fail completely thereby making it impossible to
benefit from this approach.

Cu) and Co (0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1 per Cu). These impurities were doped in
high-quality single-crystals synthesized by the floating zone method. The
magnetic susceptibility of pristine Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ is analyzed
rigorously to confirm that at low temperatures (T $<$ 5 K), the ""free"" spins in
the chains undergo a long-distance dimerization as proposed in a recent study
[Sahling et al. Nature Phys., \textbf{11}, 255 (2015)]. The effect of impurity
on these dimers is analyzed by measuring the specific heat down to T = 0.06 K.
We found that even at the lower impurity concentration, the long-distance
dimers are significantly severed, but the quantum entangled spin dimerized
state of the chains persists. On the other hand, the other type of spin dimers
that forms at relatively higher temperatures via an intervening Zhang-Rice
singlet are found to be practically unaffected at the lower impurity
concentration; but at 1\% doping, even these are found to be considerably
severed. The effect of Co impurity turned out to be most unusual displaying a
strongly anisotropic response, and with a dimerization gap that suppresses
faster along the chain/ladder direction than perpendicular to it as a function
of increasing Co concentration.

of a continuous weak linear measurement (CWLM). As a tool, we implement an
efficient numerical simulation scheme that allows us to generate single quantum
trajectories of the measured system state as well as the recorded detector
signal, and study statistics of these trajectories with and without
post-selection. In this scheme, a linear detector is modelled with a qubit that
is weakly coupled to the quantum system measured and is subject to projective
measurement and re-initialization after a time interval at each simulation
step. We explain the conditions under which the scheme provides an accurate
description of CWLM.
  We restrict ourselves to a qubit non-demolition measurement. The qubit is
initially in an equal-weight superposition of two quantum states. In the course
of time, the detector signal is accumulated and the superposition is destroyed.
The times required to resolve the quantum states and to destroy the
superposition are of the same order. We prove numerically a rather counter
intuitive fact: the average detector output conditioned on the final state does
not depend on time. It looks like from the very beginning, the qubit knows in
which state it is. We study statistics of decision times where the decision
time is defined as time required for the density matrix along a certain
trajectory to reach a threshold where it is close to one of the resulting
states. This statistics is useful to estimate how fast a decisive CWLM can be.
Basing on this, we devise and study a simple feedback scheme that attempts to
keep the qubit in the equal-weight superposition. The detector readings are
used to decide in which state the qubit is and which correction rotation to
apply to bring it back to the superposition. We show how to optimize the
feedback parameters and move towards more efficient feedback schemes.

violations depend only on the read-from relation, we avoid a potentially
significant source of redundancy. Our framework is based on a novel technique
for determining whether a particular read-from relation is feasible under the
RA semantics. We define an SMC algorithm which is provably optimal in the sense
that it explores each program order and read-from relation exactly once. This
optimality result is strictly stronger than previous analogous optimality
results, which also take coherence order into account. We have implemented our
framework in the tool Tracer. Experiments show that Tracer can be significantly
faster than state-of-the-art tools that can handle the RA semantics.

promising performance for action recognition. In this paper, we propose
weighted Long Short-Term Memory adopted with convolutional neural network
representations for three dimensional tennis shots recognition. First, the
local two-dimensional convolutional neural network spatial representations are
extracted from each video frame individually using a pre-trained Inception
network. Then, a weighted Long Short-Term Memory decoder is introduced to take
the output state at time t and the historical embedding feature at time t-1 to
generate feature vector using a score weighting scheme. Finally, we use the
adopted CNN and weighted LSTM to map the original visual features into a vector

advocated as possible signals of modifications to gravity in the strong-field

entirely from the appearance of nonzero reflection probability at the horizon,
which vanishes for a standard black hole. We show how to apply EFT reasoning to
these arguments, using and extending earlier work for localized systems that
relates choices of boundary condition to the action for the physics responsible
for these boundary conditions. EFT reasoning applied to this action argues that
linear `Robin' boundary conditions dominate at low energies, and we determine
the relationship between the corresponding effective coupling (whose value is
the one relevant low-energy prediction of particular modifications to General
Relativity for these systems) and the phenomenologically measurable
near-horizon reflection coefficient. Because this connection involves only
near-horizon physics it is comparatively simple to establish, and we do so for
perturbations in both the Schwarzschild geometry (which is the one most often
studied theoretically) and the Kerr geometry (which is the one of observational
interest for post-merger ring down). In passing we identify the
renormalization-group evolution of the effective couplings as a function of a
regularization distance from the horizon, that enforces how physics does not
depend on the precise position where the boundary conditions are imposed. We
show that the perfect-absorber/perfect-emitter boundary conditions of General
Relativity correspond to the only fixed points of this evolution. Nontrivial
running of all other RG evolution reflects how modifications to gravity
necessarily introduce new physics near the horizon.

estimating the coherence of implemented quantum gates independently of state

number of data points to rigorous confidence intervals. In this work we provide
a bound on the required number of data points for Clifford URB as a function of
confidence and experimental parameters. This bound has favorable scaling in the
regime of near-unitary noise and is asymptotically independent of the length of
the gate sequences used. We also show that, in contrast to standard randomized
benchmarking, a nontrivial number of data points is always required to overcome
the randomness introduced by state preparation and measurement errors even in
the limit of perfect gates. Our bound is sufficiently sharp to benchmark
small-dimensional systems in realistic parameter regimes using a modest number
of data points. For example, we show that the unitarity of single-qubit
Clifford gates can be rigorously estimated using few hundred data points under
the assumption of gate-independent noise. This is a reduction of orders of
magnitude compared to previously known bounds.

account for per-antenna maximum power constraints to avoid non-linear
distortion in power amplifiers and user-specific minimum rate constraints to
guarantee certain service levels and fairness. To be energy-efficient, transmit
antenna selection is employed. It eventually leads to a mixed-Boolean
fractional program. We then propose two different approaches to solve this
difficult problem. The first solution is based on a novel modeling technique
that produces a tight continuous relaxation. The second approach is based on
sparsity-inducing method, which does not require the introduction of any
Boolean variable. We also investigate the trade-off between the energy
efficiency and sum rate by proposing two different formulations. In the first
formulation, we propose a new metric that is the ratio of the sum rate and the
so-called weighted power. Specifically, this metric reduces to EEmax when the
weight is 1, and to sum rate maximization when the weight is 0. In the other
method, we treat the trade-off problem as a multi-objective optimization for
which a scalarization approach is adopted. Numerical results illustrate
significant achievable energy efficiency gains over the method where the
antenna selection is not employed. The effect of antenna selection on the
energy efficiency and sum rate trade-off is also demonstrated.

Our algorithm reduces foreshortening substantially compared to the input view

precision, however, decreases when the vessel is off-centered or foreshortened.
We evaluate worst case boundaries, providing insight in the maximal

Moreover, the presented comb provides detailed insight into particularities of
the spectrograph such as detector inhomogeneities and differential spectrograph

standard star (HD221354) and telluric atmospheric absorption features. The
advantages of the system include simplicity, robustness and turn-key operation,
features that are valuable at the observation sites.

is usually attributed to the initial configuration of the agents being too
spread out, the graph topology having certain undesired symmetries, or both.
Besides nonlinearity, the role played by the geometry and topology of the
nonlinear space is often overlooked. This paper concerns two gradient descent
flows of quadratic disagreement functions on general Riemannian manifolds. One
system is intrinsic while the other is extrinsic. We derive necessary
conditions for the agents to synchronize from almost all initial conditions
when the graph used to model the network is connected. If a Riemannian manifold
contains a closed curve of locally minimum length, then there is a connected
graph and a dense set of initial conditions from which the intrinsic system
fails to synchronize. The extrinsic system fails to synchronize if the manifold
is multiply connected. The extrinsic system appears in the Kuramoto model on
$\smash{\mathcal{S}^1}$, rigid-body attitude synchronization on
$\mathsf{SO}(3)$, the Lohe model of quantum synchronization on the $n$-sphere,
and the Lohe model on $\mathsf{U}(n)$. Except for the Lohe model on the
$n$-sphere where $n\in\mathbb{N}\backslash\{1\}$, there are dense sets of
initial conditions on which these systems fail to synchronize. The reason for
this difference is that the $n$-sphere is simply connected for all
$n\in\mathbb{N}\backslash\{1\}$ whereas the other manifolds are multiply
connected.

indication of a coordinate system which is best adapted for the holographic

accretion on a MBH at the center of a spherically symmetric one-component Jaffe
galaxy model. Here we apply this solution to galaxy models where both the
stellar and total mass density distributions are described by the Jaffe
profile, with different scale-lengths and masses, and to which a central MBH is
added. For such galaxy models all the relevant stellar dynamical properties can
also be derived analytically (Ciotti & Ziaee Lorzad 2018). In these new models
the hydrodynamical and stellar dynamical properties are linked by imposing that
the gas temperature is proportional to the virial temperature of the galaxy
stellar component. The formulae that are provided allow to evaluate all flow
properties, and are then useful for estimates of the scale-radius and the mass
flow rate when modeling accretion on massive black holes at the center of
galaxies. As an application, we quantify the departure from the true mass
accretion rate of estimates obtained using the gas properties at various
distances from the MBH, under the hypothesis of classical Bondi accretion.

but the system performance may degrade significantly due to mobile blockers and
the user's own body. A high frequency of interruptions and long duration of
blockage may degrade the quality of experience. For example, delays of more
than about 10ms cause nausea to VR viewers. Macro-diversity of base stations
(BSs) has been considered a promising solution where the user equipment (UE)
can handover to other available BSs, if the current serving BS gets blocked.
However, an analytical model for the frequency and duration of dynamic blockage
events in this setting is largely unknown.In this paper, we consider an open
park-like scenario and obtain closed-form expressions for the blockage
probability, expected frequency and duration of blockage events using
stochastic geometry. Our results indicate that the minimum density of BS that
is required to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of AR/VR and
other low latency applications is largely driven by blockage events rather than
capacity requirements. Placing the BS at a greater height reduces the
likelihood of blockage. We present a closed-form expression for the BS
density-height trade-off that can be used for network planning.

of the classes. Conventional ZSL methods have equally dealt with all the
available attributes, but this sometimes causes misclassification. This is
because an attribute that is effective for classifying instances of one class
is not always effective for another class. In this case, a metric of
classifying the latter class can be undesirably influenced by the irrelevant
attribute. This paper solves this problem by taking the importance of each
attribute for each class into account when calculating the metric. In addition
to the proposal of this new method, this paper also contributes by providing a
dataset for pose classification based on wearable sensors, named HDPoseDS. It
contains 22 classes of poses performed by 10 subjects with 31 IMU sensors
across full body. To the best of our knowledge, it is the richest

the measurement protocol follows directly from the simple relation describing
the radial diffusion of carriers injected by a laser source. The use of a probe
laser beam permits an analytic parameterization for the Z dependence of the
photoreflectance signal which depends soley on the focal parameters and the
carrier diffusion length. This allows electronic transport properties to be

should be designed for VRU safety applications to study their performance. In
this article, we first propose an end-to-end Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P)
framework to provide situational awareness and hazard detection based on the
most common and injury-prone crash scenarios. The details of our VRU safety
module, including target classification and collision detection algorithms, are
explained next. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a mitigating solution for
congestion and power consumption issues in such systems. Finally, the whole
system is implemented and analyzed for realistic crash scenarios.

and more multi-thread-safe, if not multi-thread-friendly and multi-threaded.
This is usually done using the new constructs and library components offered by
the C++11 and C++14 standards. These components are however quite low-level and
hard to use and compose.
  However, Go provides a set of better building blocks for tackling
concurrency: goroutines and channels. This language is now used by the whole
cloud industry: docker/moby, rkt, Kubernetes are obvious flagships for Go. But
to be able to perform any meaningful physics analysis, one needs a set of basic
libraries (matrix operations, linear algebra, plotting, I/O, ...) We present
Go-HEP, a set of packages to easily write concurrent software to interface with
legacy HENP C++ physics libraries.

modeling and analysis of physical phenomenon, engineering systems and signals
in numerous applications. In this study, we present the generalized Fourier
representation (GFR) that is completely based on the FR of a signal, and
introduce the phase transform (PT) which is a special case of the GFR and a
true generalization of the Hilbert transform. We derive the PT kernel to obtain
any constant phase shift, discuss the various properties of the PT, and
demonstrate that (i) a constant phase shift in a signal corresponds to variable
time-delays in all harmonics, (ii) to obtain a constant time-delay in a signal,
one need to provide variable phase shift in all harmonics, (iii) a constant
phase shift is same as the constant time-delay only for single frequency
sinusoid. The time derivative and time integral, including fractional order, of
a signal can be obtained using the GFR. We propose to use discrete cosine
transform (DCT) based implementation to avoid end artifacts due to
discontinuities present in both end of the signal. We introduce fractional
delay of a discrete time signal using the FR, and present the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) implementation of all the above proposed representations. Using
the analytic wavelet transform (AWT), we propose wavelet phase transform (WPT)
to obtain a desired phase-shift in a signal under-analysis, and propose the two
representations of wavelet quadrature transform (WQT) which is special case of
the WPT where phase-shift is $\pi/2$ radians.

From the perspective of the passengers and the transit agencies, overcrowding
of the train cars has several negative consequences such as: (i) extended
duration of passengers boarding and alighting which leads to longer dwell
times, (ii) subsequent disruption of the headway and the schedule, and (iii)
passenger dissatisfaction (e.g. increased stress and lack of privacy).
Moreover, overcrowding during peak service hours also indicates inadequate
infrastructure to meet the passenger demands. Realizing the importance of the
crowding issue, transit agencies have developed measures to assess the crowding
levels. The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual provides guidelines
on thresholds for crowding in transit systems in the United States.

the dynamic case. The model is characterized by a regularized fracture energy
that is linear in the damage field, as well as non-polynomial degradation
functions. Two categories of degradation functions are examined, and a process
to derive a given degradation function based on a local stress-strain response
in the cohesive zone is presented. The resulting model is characterized by a
linear elastic regime prior to the onset of damage, and controlled
strain-softening thereafter. The governing equations are derived according to
macro- and microforce balance theories, naturally accounting for the
irreversible nature of the fracture process by introducing suitable constraints
for the kinetics of the underlying microstructural changes. The model is
complemented by an efficient staggered solution scheme based on an augmented
Lagrangian method. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed model is a
robust and effective method for simulating cohesive crack propagation, with
particular emphasis on dynamic fracture.
