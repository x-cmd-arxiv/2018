numerically approximate solutions to a system of polynomial equations. If the
system is well-constrained (i.e., square), Newton's method is locally
quadratically convergent near each nonsingular solution. In such cases, Smale's
alpha theory can be used to certify that a given point is in the quadratic
convergence basin of some solution. This was extended to certifiably determine
the reality of the corresponding solution when the polynomial system is real.
Using the theory of Newton-invariant sets, we certifiably decide the reality of
projections of solutions. We apply this method to certifiably count the number
of real and totally real tritangent planes for instances of curves of genus 4.

moments of the conditional success probability (CSP), which is defined as
{success probability for a given realization of the transmitters}, in
large-scale co-channel uplink and downlink non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) networks with one NOMA cluster per cell. The moments of CSP translate to
various network performance metrics such as the standard success or
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage probability (which is the $1$-st
moment), the mean local delay (which is the $-1$-st moment in a static network
setting), and the meta distribution (which is the complementary cumulative
distribution function of the conditional success probability and can be
approximated by using the $1$-st and $2$-nd moments). For uplink NOMA, to make
the framework tractable, we propose two point process models for the spatial
locations of the interferers by utilizing the base station (BS)/user pair
correlation function. We validate the proposed models by comparing the second
moment measure of each model with that of the actual point process for the
inter-cluster (or inter-cell) interferers obtained via simulations. For
downlink NOMA, we derive closed-form solutions for the moments of the CSP,
success (or coverage) probability, average local delay, and meta distribution
for the users. As an application of the developed analytical framework, we use
the closed-form expressions to optimize the power allocations for downlink NOMA
users in order to maximize the success probability of a given NOMA user with
and without latency constraints. Closed-form optimal solutions for the transmit
powers are obtained for two-user NOMA scenario. We note that maximizing the
success probability with latency constraints can significantly impact the
optimal power solutions for low SIR thresholds and favour orthogonal multiple

to develop an efficient system for EEG data compression. In this system, the
recorded EEG data are firstly preprocessed in the preprocessing unit.
Standardization and segmentation of EEG data are done in this unit. Then, the
resulting EEG data are passed to the compression unite. The compression unit
composes of a lossy compression algorithm followed by a lossless compression
algorithm. The lossy compression algorithm transforms the randomness EEG data
into data with high redundancy. Subsequently, A lossless compression algorithm
is added to investigate the high redundancy of the resulting data to get high

show that adding RLE after the DCT algorithm gives the best performance in

discretize the two- and three-dimensional fractional Laplacian

form. The proposed finite difference methods provide a fractional analogue of
the central difference schemes to the fractional Laplacian, and as $\alpha \to
2^-$, they collapse to the central difference schemes of the classical Laplace
operator $-\Delta$. We prove that our methods are consistent if $u \in
C^{\lfloor\alpha\rfloor, \alpha-\lfloor\alpha\rfloor+\epsilon}({\mathbb R}^d)$,
and the local truncation error is ${\mathcal O}(h^\epsilon)$, with $\epsilon >
0$ a small constant and $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ denoting the floor function. If
$u \in C^{2+\lfloor\alpha\rfloor,
\alpha-\lfloor\alpha\rfloor+\epsilon}({\mathbb R}^d)$, they can achieve the
second order of accuracy for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$. These results hold for
any dimension $d \ge 1$ and thus improve the existing error estimates for the
finite difference method of the one-dimensional fractional Laplacian. Extensive
numerical experiments are provided and confirm our analytical results. We then
apply our method to solve the fractional Poisson problems and the fractional
Allen-Cahn equations. Numerical simulations suggest that to achieve the second
order of accuracy, the solution of the fractional Poisson problem should {\it
at most} satisfy $u \in C^{1,1}({\mathbb R}^d)$. One merit of our methods is
that they yield a multilevel Toeplitz stiffness matrix, an appealing property
for the development of fast algorithms via the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
Our studies of the two- and three-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equations
demonstrate the efficiency of our methods in solving the high-dimensional

we use the (fully resummed) propagator of the unstable particle, denoted as
$S,$ to obtain the energy probability distribution, called $d_{S}^{\mathbf{p}
}(E)$, as the imaginary part of the propagator. The nondecay probability
amplitude of the particle $S$ with momentum $\mathbf{p}$ turns out to be, as
usual, its Fourier transform: $a_{S}^{\mathbf{p}}(t)=\int_{\sqrt{m_{th}
^{2}+\mathbf{p}^{2}}}^{\infty}dEd_{S}^{\mathbf{p}}(E)e^{-iEt}$ ($m_{th}$ is the
lowest energy threshold in the energy frame, corresponding to the sum of masses
of the decay products). Upon a variable transformation, one can rewrite it as
$a_{S}^{\mathbf{p}}(t)=\int_{m_{th}}^{\infty}dmd_{S}

obtained by different approaches, is here confirmed in an independent and, most
importantly, covariant QFT-based approach. Its consequences are not yet fully

  First, we show that there exist difficult problem instances, such that it

polynomial filtering techniques into modern first-order algorithms. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time that lower rate bounds and optimal

problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control.
Recently developed convex relaxation techniques provide new insights regarding
the global optimality of AC~OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation
is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the
trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow
equations. This paper proposes two methods for tightening the QC relaxation.
The first method introduces new variables that represent the voltage magnitude
differences between connected buses. Using ""bound tightening"" techniques, the
bounds on the voltage magnitude difference variables can be significantly
smaller than the bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves, so constraints
based on voltage magnitude differences can tighten the relaxation. Second,
rather than a potentially weaker ""nested McCormick"" formulation, this paper
applies ""Meyer and Floudas"" envelopes that yield the convex hull of the
trilinear monomials formed by the product of the voltage magnitudes and
trignometric terms in the polar form of the power flow equations. Comparison to
a state-of-the-art QC implementation demonstrates the advantages of these
improvements via smaller optimality gaps.

a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized face

the network to directly exploit the knowledge of true contrast agent kinetics
in the training phase, and hence provide more accurate restoration of PK
parameters. Experiments on clinical brain DCE datasets demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in terms of fidelity of PK parameter reconstruction and
significantly faster parameter inference compared to a model-based iterative

reduction in turbulent Taylor-Couette flow, i.e.\ the flow between two
concentric, independently rotating cylinders. We measure the drag in the system
for the cases with and without air, and add roughness by installing transverse
ribs on either one or both of the cylinders. For the smooth wall case (no ribs)
and the case of ribs on the inner cylinder only, we observe strong drag
reduction up to $DR=33\%$ and $DR=23\%$, respectively, for a void fraction of
$\alpha=6\%$. However, with ribs mounted on both cylinders or on the outer
cylinder only, the drag reduction is weak, less than $DR=11\%$, and thus quite
close to the trivial effect of reduced effective density. Flow visualizations
show that stable turbulent Taylor vortices --- large scale vortical structures
--- are induced in these two cases, i.e. the cases with ribs on the outer
cylinder. These strong secondary flows move the bubbles away from the boundary
layer, making the bubbles less effective than what had previously been observed
for the smooth-wall case. Measurements with counter-rotating smooth cylinders,
a regime in which pronounced Taylor rolls are also induced, confirm that it is
really the Taylor vortices that weaken the bubble drag reduction mechanism. Our
findings show that, although bubble drag reduction can indeed be effective for
smooth walls, its effect can be spoiled by e.g.\ biofouling and omnipresent
wall roughness, as the roughness can induce strong secondary flows.

quantification. However, ASL suffers from an inherently low-signal-to-noise

to achieve a reasonable image quality, which in return increases motion
sensitivity. This leads to clinically prolonged scanning times increasing the
risk of motion artifacts. Thus, there is an immense need of advanced imaging
and processing techniques in ASL. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
learning based approach to improve the perfusion-weighted image quality
obtained from a subset of all available pairwise C/L subtractions.
Specifically, we train a deep fully convolutional network (FCN) to learn a
mapping from noisy perfusion-weighted image and its subtraction (residual) from
the clean image. Additionally, we incorporate the CBF estimation model in the
loss function during training, which enables the network to produce high
quality images while simultaneously enforcing the CBF estimates to be as close
as reference CBF values. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical ASL
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of improved ASL
image quality, accurate CBF parameter estimation and considerably small

of ion-impact electron transfer and ionization cross sections to proton
collisions from water, neon, and carbon clusters. The model is based on a
geometrical interpretation of the cluster cross section as an effective area
composed of overlapping circular disks that are representative of the atomic
contributions. The latter are calculated using a time-dependent
density-functional-theory-based single-particle description with accurate
exchange-only ground-state potentials. We find that the net capture and
ionization cross sections in p-X$_n$ collisions are proportional to $n^\alpha$
with $2/3 \le \alpha \le 1$. For capture from water clusters at 100 keV impact
energy $\alpha$ is close to one, which is substantially different from the
value $\alpha=2/3$ predicted by a previous theoretical work based on the
simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics method. For ionization at 100 keV and
for capture at lower energies we find smaller $\alpha$ values than for capture
at 100 keV. This can be understood by considering the magnitude of the atomic
cross sections and the resulting overlaps of the circular disks that make up
the cluster cross section in our model. Results for neon and carbon clusters
confirm these trends. Simple parametrizations are found which fit the cross
sections remarkably well and suggest that they depend on the relevant bond
lengths.

measurements of nuclear decays appear to exhibit unexpected variations.
Generally, the isotopes reporting these variations have long half lives, which
are plagued by large measurement uncertainties. In addition to these inherent
problems, there are some reports of time-dependent decay rates and even claims
of exotic neutrino-induced variations. We present a dedicated experiment for
the stable long-term measurement of gamma emissions resulting from $\beta$
decays, which will provide high-quality data and allow for the identification
of potential systematic influences. Radioactive isotopes are monitored
redundantly by thirty-two 76 mm $\times$ 76 mm NaI(Tl) detectors in four
separate temperature-controlled setups across three continents. In each setup,
the monitoring of environmental and operational conditions facilitates
correlation studies. The deadtime-free performance of the data acquisition
system is monitored by LED pulsers. Digitized photomultiplier waveforms of all
events are recorded individually, enabling a study of time-dependent effects
spanning microseconds to years, using both time-binned and unbinned analyses.
We characterize the experiment's stability and show that the relevant
systematics are accounted for, enabling precise measurements of effects at
levels well below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$.

example case of chlorine evolution reaction on rutile oxides, which can occur
through at least three reaction mechanisms each mediated by different surface
intermediates and active sites. We utilize Bayesian error estimation
capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation (XC) functional to
quantify the uncertainty associated with predictions of the operative reaction
mechanism by systematically propagating the uncertainty originating from
DFT-computed adsorption free energies. We construct surface Pourbaix diagrams
based on the calculated adsorption free energies for rutile oxides of Ru, Ir,
Ti, Pt, V, Sn and Rh. We utilize confidence-value (c-value) to determine the
degree of confidence in the predicted surface phase diagrams. Using the scaling
relations between the adsorption energies of intermediates we construct a
generalized Pourbaix diagram showing the stable surface composition as a
function of potential and the oxygen binding energy on the cus site. This is
used to consistently determine activity volcano relationships. We incorporate
the uncertainty in linear scaling relations to quantify the confidence in
generalized Pourbaix diagram and the associated activity. This allows us to
compute the expectation limiting potential as a function of $\Delta E_{O^c}$,
which provides a more appropriate activity measure incorporating DFT
uncertainty. We show that the confidence in the classification problem of
identifying the active reaction mechanism is much better than the prediction

and has significant influence on many industrial and geotechnical applications.
In this work, a modified smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model is
employed to simulate surface tension, contact angle, and dynamic wetting
effects. The wetting and dewetting phenomena are simulated in a capillary tube,
where the liquid particles are raised or withdrawn by a shifting substrate. The
SPH model is modified by introducing a newly-developed viscous force
formulation at liquid-solid interface to reproduce the rate-dependent behaviour
of moving contact line. Dynamic contact angle simulations with interfacial
viscous force are conducted to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of this
new formulation. In addition, the influence of interfacial viscous force with
different magnitude on contact angle dynamics is examined by empirical power
law correlations, and the derived constants suggest the dynamic contact angle
changes monotonically with interfacial viscous force. The simulation results
are consistent with the experimental observations and theoretical predictions,
implying that the interfacial viscous force can be associated with slip length
of flow and microscopic surface roughness. This work has demonstrated that the
modified SPH model can successfully account for the rate-dependent effects of
moving contact line, and can be used for realistic multiphase flow simulation
under dynamic conditions.

subjected to FUV radiation (115-400 nm) for a range of initial
CO$_{2}$/CH$_{4}$/O$_{2}$ mixing ratios (O$_{2}$ ranging from 2 ppm to 0.2\%).
At the lowest O$_{2}$ concentration (2 ppm), the addition increased particle
production for all but one gas mixture. At higher oxygen concentrations (20 ppm
and greater) particles are still produced, but the addition of O$_{2}$
decreases the production rate. Both the particle size and number density
decrease with increasing O$_{2}$, indicating that O$_{2}$ affects particle
nucleation and growth. The particle density increases with increasing O$_{2}$.
The addition of CO$_{2}$ and O$_{2}$ not only increases the amount of oxygen in
the aerosol, but it also increases the degree of nitrogen incorporation. In
particular, the addition of O$_{2}$ results in the formation of nitrate bearing
molecules. The fact that the presence of oxygen bearing molecules increases the
efficiency of nitrogen fixation has implications for the role of haze as a
source of molecules required for the origin and evolution of life. The
composition changes also likely affect the absorption and scattering behavior

connected graph by adding at most $k$ edges from a given candidate edge set. We
give both algorithmic and hardness results for this problem:
  - We give a greedy algorithm that, using submodularity, obtains an
approximation ratio of $(1 - 1/e - \epsilon)$ in the exponent of the number of
spanning trees for any $\epsilon > 0$ in time $\tilde{O}(m \epsilon^{-1} + (n +
q) \epsilon^{-3})$, where $m$ and $q$ is the number of edges in the original
graph and the candidate edge set, respectively. Our running time is optimal
with respect to the input size up to logarithmic factors, and substantially
improves upon the $O(n^3)$ running time of the previous proposed greedy
algorithm with approximation ratio $(1 - 1/e)$ in the exponent. Notably, the
independence of our running time of $k$ is novel, comparing to conventional
top-$k$ selections on graphs that usually run in $\Omega(mk)$ time. A key
ingredient of our greedy algorithm is a routine for maintaining effective
resistances under edge additions in an online-offline hybrid setting.
  - We show the exponential inapproximability of this problem by proving that
there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that it is NP-hard to approximate the
optimum number of spanning trees in the exponent within $(1 - c)$. This
inapproximability result follows from a reduction from the minimum path cover
in undirected graphs, whose hardness again follows from the constant
inapproximability of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with distances 1 and
2. Thus, the approximation ratio of our algorithm is also optimal up to a
constant factor in the exponent. To our knowledge, this is the first hardness
of approximation result for maximizing the number of spanning trees in a graph,
or equivalently, by Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem, maximizing the determinant
of an SDDM matrix.

originated in fast fluctuations between these different electronic

introduces a double acceptor level in the top of the valence band of the doped

by pairwise inner products of inter-agent displacements. Compared to
distance-based rigidity, weak rigidity requires fewer constrained edges in the
graph to determine a geometric shape in an arbitrarily dimensional space. A
necessary and sufficient graphical condition for infinitesimal weak rigidity of
planar frameworks is derived. As an application of the proposed weak rigidity
theory, a gradient based control law and a non-gradient based control law are
designed for a group of single-integrator modeled agents to stabilize a desired
formation shape, respectively. Using the gradient control law, we prove that an
infinitesimally weakly rigid formation is locally exponentially stable. In
particular, if the number of agents is one greater than the dimension of the
space, a minimally infinitesimally weakly rigid formation is almost globally
asymptotically stable. In the literature of rigid formation, the sensing graph
is always required to be rigid. Using the non-gradient control law based on
weak rigidity theory, the sensing graph is unnecessary to be rigid for local
exponential stability of the formation. A numerical simulation is performed for
illustrating effectiveness of our main results.

is considered. The caching policy allows a user to determine whether and how
long it should cache a content item according to the prediction of its random
request time, also referred to as the request delay information (RDI). In
particular, the aim is to maximize the caching gain for communications while
limiting its storage cost. To achieve this goal, a queueing theoretic model for
caching with infinite buffers is first formulated, in which Little's law is
adopted to obtain the tradeoff between the hit ratio and the average buffer
consumption. When there exist multiple content classes with different RDIs, the
storage efficiency is further optimized by carefully allocating the storage
cost. For more practical finite-buffer caching, a $G/GI/L/0$ queue model is
formulated, in which a diffusion approximation and Erlang-B formula are adopted
to determine the buffer overflow probability and the corresponding hit ratio.
The optimal hit ratio is shown to be limited by the demand probability and
buffer size for large and small buffers respectively. In practice, a user may
exploit probabilistic caching with random maximum caching time and arithmetic
caching without any need for content arrival statistics to efficiently harvest
content files in air.

computation graph that is reminiscent of a deep neural network. This
observation allows one to leverage tools from machine learning to reduce
complexity. In particular, the main disadvantage of the SSFM is that its
complexity using M steps is at least M times larger than a linear equalizer.
This is because the linear SSFM operator is a dense matrix. In previous work,
truncation methods such as frequency sampling, wavelets, or least-squares have
been used to obtain ""cheaper"" operators that can be implemented using filters.
However, a large number of filter taps are typically required to limit
truncation errors. For example, Ip and Kahn showed that for a 10 Gbaud signal
and 2000 km optical link, a truncated SSFM with 25 steps would require 70-tap
filters in each step and 100 times more operations than linear equalization. We
find that, by jointly optimizing all filters with deep learning, the complexity
can be reduced significantly for similar accuracy. Using optimized 5-tap and
3-tap filters in an alternating fashion, one requires only around 2-6 times the
complexity of linear equalization, depending on the implementation.

exploited in order to experimentally extract quantum work statistics in

simultaneous competition in m basic n-agent games, called a multi-game. We then
prove that an own-type-linear Bayesian game is type-regular if it is

for reinforcement learning. In contrast to methods that explicitly restrict or
cripple lower layers of a hierarchy to force them to use higher-level
modulating signals, each layer in our framework is trained to directly solve
the task, but acquires a range of diverse strategies via a maximum entropy
reinforcement learning objective. Each layer is also augmented with latent
random variables, which are sampled from a prior distribution during the
training of that layer. The maximum entropy objective causes these latent
variables to be incorporated into the layer's policy, and the higher level
layer can directly control the behavior of the lower layer through this latent
space. Furthermore, by constraining the mapping from latent variables to
actions to be invertible, higher layers retain full expressivity: neither the
higher layers nor the lower layers are constrained in their behavior. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can improve on the performance of
single-layer policies on standard benchmark tasks simply by adding additional
layers, and that our method can solve more complex sparse-reward tasks by
learning higher-level policies on top of high-entropy skills optimized for
simple low-level objectives.

semantics called change-of-base semantics. Change-of-base semantics is novel in
that it is based on (possibly infinitely) iterated enrichment and
interpretation of modality as hom objects. In our semantics, the relationship
between meta and object levels in multi-staged computation exactly corresponds
to the relationship between enriching and enriched categories. As a result, we
obtain a categorical explanation of situations where meta and object logics may
be completely different. Our categorical models include conventional models of
modal type theory (e.g., cartesian closed categories with a monoidal
endofunctor) as special cases and hence can be seen as a natural refinement of
former results.
  On the type theoretical side, it is shown that Fitch-style modal type theory
can be directly interpreted in iterated enrichment of categories.
Interestingly, this interpretation suggests the fact that Fitch-style modal
type theory is the right adjoint of dual-context calculus. In addition, we
present how linear temporal, S4, and linear exponential modalities are
described in terms of change-of-base semantics. Finally, we show that the

learning (MTL), which learns multiple face attributes simultaneously to achieve
shared or mutually related representations of different attributes. The most
widely used MTL convolutional neural network is heuristically or empirically
designed by sharing all of the convolutional layers and splitting at the fully
connected layers for task-specific losses. However, it is improper to view all
low and mid-level features for different attributes as being the same,
especially when these attributes are only loosely related. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-attribute tensor correlation neural network (MTCN) for
face attribute prediction. The structure shares the information in low-level
features (e.g., the first two convolutional layers) but splits that in
high-level features (e.g., from the third convolutional layer to the fully
connected layer). At the same time, during high-level feature extraction, each
subnetwork (e.g., Age-Net, Gender-Net, ..., and Smile-Net) excavates closely
related features from other networks to enhance its features. Then, we project
the features of the C9 layers of the fine-tuned subnetworks into a highly
correlated space by using a novel tensor correlation analysis algorithm
(NTCCA). The final face attribute prediction is made based on the correlation
matrix. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes
(CelebA and LFWA) show that the proposed approach has superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

separating the speaker characteristics from the linguistic content in speech
signals. An autoencoder is first trained to extract speaker-independent latent
representations and speaker embedding separately using another auxiliary
speaker classifier to regularize the latent representation. The decoder then
takes the speaker-independent latent representation and the target speaker
embedding as the input to generate the voice of the target speaker with the
linguistic content of the source utterance. The quality of decoder output is
further improved by patching with the residual signal produced by another pair
of generator and discriminator. A target speaker set size of 20 was tested in
the preliminary experiments, and very good voice quality was obtained.
Conventional voice conversion metrics are reported. We also show that the
speaker information has been properly reduced from the latent representations.

demand. Out of saving time in wide area data transfer, some tasks are dispersed
to the edges. However, due to limited computing, overload interference and
cluster-level unreachable troubles, efficient execution in the edges is hard,
which obstructs the guarantee on the efficiency and reliability of jobs.
Launching copies across clusters can be an insurance on a task's completion.
Considering cluster heterogeneity and accompanying remote data fetch, cluster
selection of copies affects execution quality, as different insuring plans
drive different revenues. For providing On-Line-Real-Time analysis results, a
system needs to insure the geo-distributed resource for the arriving jobs. Our
challenge is to achieve the optimal revenue by dynamically weighing the gains
due to insurance against the loss of occupying extra resource for insuring.
  To this end, we design PingAn, an online insurance algorithm promising

flowtimes via cross-cluster copying for tasks. PingAn shares resource among the
anterior fraction of jobs with the least unprocessed datasize and the fraction
is adjustable to fit the system load condition. After sharing, PingAn
concretely insures for tasks following efficiency-first reliability-aware
principle to optimize the revenue of copies on jobs' performance. Trace-driven
simulations demonstrate that PingAn can reduce the average job flowtimes by at
least $14\%$ than the state-of-the-art speculation mechanisms. We also build

event horizon and, thereby, reproduce some of the features of these proposals.
On the other hand, if the space-like shell is confined fully within the
horizon, then it results in a bounce near a space-like singularity inside the
black hole. For both cases, the null energy condition is necessarily violated,
at least effectively, due to introduction of quantum effects. If the shell,
with a non-trivial negative tension, extends beyond the event horizon, then one
can see effects of quantum gravity modifications even outside the horizon as a
cost of such a space-like surgery. Naturally, one needs to consider whether
these types of manufactured spacetimes violates any known laws of nature,

For decades, conventional models based on nonlinear elasticity theory have
predicted this thermal resistance is only appreciable when heat flux is
perpendicular to the dislocations. However, this dislocation-induced
anisotropic thermal transport has yet to be seen experimentally. In this study,
we measure strong thermal transport anisotropy governed by highly oriented
threading dislocation arrays along the cross-plane direction in micron-thick,
single-crystal indium nitride (InN) films. We find that the cross-plane thermal
conductivity is more than tenfold higher than the in-plane thermal conductivity
at 80 K when the dislocation density is on the order of ~3x10^10 cm^-2. This
large anisotropy is not predicted by the conventional models. With enhanced
understanding of dislocation-phonon interactions, our results open new regimes
for tailoring anisotropic thermal transport with line defects, and will
facilitate novel methods for directed heat dissipation in thermal management of
diverse device applications.

complete form can be seen clearly by viewing it from a long distance. Small
tiny images which replace blocks of the original image can be seen clearly by

proposed trying to automatically compose photomosaic images. Most of these
algorithms are designed with greedy algorithms to match the blocks with the
tiny images. To obtain a better visual sense and satisfy some commercial

combinatorial optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms imitating the

antennas find applications spanning from indoor short range wireless personal
area networks to outdoor cellular networks. A thorough understanding of mmWave
signal propagation through the wireless channel provides valuable insights for
the design of such networks which in turn dictates the achievable performance
limits. High path loss, penetration loss, and negligible signal scattering are
certain distinctive features of the mmWave channel which necessitates the
development of new mathematical models. Importantly, the impact of directional
antennas which spatially filter multi-path components needs to be embodied as
an integral part of the channel model. In this paper, we model outdoor
directional non-line-of-sight mmWave channels using a combination of stochastic
geometry and image theory by expressing channel parameters as joint functions
of transmitter-receiver separation distance, antenna half power beamwidth, and
antenna beam pointing direction. By approximating the signal propagation path
due to first and second order reflections from buildings, closed form
analytical expressions for average number of first order reflection components,
path loss, and root-mean square delay spread of channel are derived. The
accuracy of the model is verified by comparing numerically obtained results
with experimental data reported by various urban outdoor peer-to-peer mmWave
measurements, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed analytical

Solar activity cycles vary in amplitude and duration. The variations
can be at least partly explained by fluctuations in dynamo parameters. Aims. We
want to restrict uncertainty in fluctuating dynamo parameters and find out
which properties of the fluctuations control the amplitudes of the magnetic
field and energy in variable dynamo cycles. Methods. A flux-transport model for
the solar dynamo with fluctuations of the Babcock-Leighton type $\alpha$-effect
was applied to generate statistics of magnetic cycles for our purposes. The
statistics were compared with data on solar cycle periods to restrict the
correlation time of dynamo fluctuations. Results. A characteristic time of
fluctuations in the $\alpha$-effect is estimated to be close to the solar
rotation period. The fluctuations produce asymmetry between the times of rise
and descent of dynamo cycles, the rise time being on average shorter. The
affect of the fluctuations on cycle amplitudes depends on the phase of the
cycle in which the fluctuations occur. Negative fluctuations (decrease in
$\alpha$) in the rise phase delay decay of poloidal field and increase the
cycle amplitude in toroidal field and magnetic energy. Negative fluctuation in
the decline phase reduces the polar field at the end of a cycle and the
amplitude of the next cycle. The low amplitude of the 24th solar cycle compared
to the preceding 23rd cycle can be explained by this effect. Positive
fluctuations in the descent phase enhance the magnetic energy of the next cycle
by increasing the seed poloidal field for the next cycle. The statistics of the
computed energies of the cycles suggest that superflares of $\ge 10^{34}$ erg
are not possible on the Sun.

coefficients of signals (which are used as a model for generalized linear

quantization is generally not invertible, and thus one can only recover an
approximation to the original signal from its quantized coefficients. The
non-linear nature of quantization makes the analysis of the corresponding
approximation error challenging, often resulting in the use of a simplifying
assumption, called the ""white noise hypothesis"" (WNH) that simplifies this
analysis. However, the WNH is known to be not rigorous and, at least in certain

the measurements, which are consecutively quantized via MSQ. For this setting,
the numerically observed decay rate seems to agree with the prediction by the
WNH. We rigorously establish sharp non-asymptotic error bounds without using
the WNH that explains the observed decay rate. Furthermore, we show that the
reconstruction error does not necessarily diminish as redundancy increases. We
also extend this approach to the compressed sensing setting, obtaining rigorous
error bounds that agree with empirical observations, again, without resorting

a summary that depends on the particular aspect of a video the viewer focuses

$\textit{viewpoint}$ may be, we assume that several other videos are available,
especially groups of videos, e.g., as folders on a person's phone or laptop.
The semantic similarity between videos in a group vs. the dissimilarity between
groups is used to produce $\textit{viewpoint}$-specific summaries. For
considering similarity as well as avoiding redundancy, output summary should be
(A) diverse, (B) representative of videos in the same group, and (C)
discriminative against videos in the different groups. To satisfy these
requirements (A)-(C) simultaneously, we proposed a novel video summarization
method from multiple groups of videos. Inspired by Fisher's discriminant
criteria, it selects summary by optimizing the combination of three terms (a)
inner-summary, (b) inner-group, and (c) between-group variances defined on the
feature representation of summary, which can simply represent (A)-(C).
Moreover, we developed a novel dataset to investigate how well the generated
summary reflects the underlying $\textit{viewpoint}$. Quantitative and

under the assumption of digit dependencies in their expansion in a given
integer base. We quantify precisely how much digit dependence can be allowed
such that, still, almost all real numbers are normal. Our theorem states that
almost all real numbers are normal when at least slightly more than $\log \log
n$ consecutive digits with indices starting at position $n$ are independent. As
the main application, we consider the Toeplitz set $T_P$, which is the set of
all sequences $a_1a_2 \ldots $ of symbols from $\{0, \ldots, b-1\}$ such that
$a_n$ is equal to $a_{pn}$, for every $p$ in $P$ and $n=1,2,\ldots$. Here $b$
is an integer base and $P$ is a finite set of prime numbers. We show that
almost every real number whose base $b$ expansion is in $T_P$ is normal to base
$b$. In the case when $P$ is the singleton set $\{2\}$ we prove that more is
true: almost every real number whose base $b$ expansion is in $T_P$ is normal
to all integer bases. We also consider the Toeplitz transform which maps the
set of all sequences to the set $T_P$ and we characterize the normal sequences
whose Toeplitz transform is normal as well.

so-called Bhabha process is influenced by t-channel Z/photon exchange. In spite
of the complexity of the resulting angular distribution of this process, one
observes a good sensitivity to Zprime exchange, similar to those observed in
annihilation channels. This feature is illustrated within the gauge-Higgs
unification model, GHU, which shows an impressive indirect sensitivity to the
mass of Zprime particles, up to about 20 TeV for the leptonic channels. Beam
longitudinal polarisation and high luminosity are the key ingredients for this
result. Measuring the Zprime ee coupling with the Bhabha process allows to
measure separately Zprimemumu and Zprimetautau coupling, which serves for a
precise test of lepton universality. Zprimebb and Zprimett couplings show good
sensitivities to GHU. LHC and HE-LHC sensitivities are also discussed.

or local optima. Therefore, increasing niching metaheuristic algorithms, which
devote to finding multiple optima in a single run, are developed to solve these
multimodal optimization problems. However, there are two difficulties urgently
to be solved for most existing niching metaheuristic algorithms: how to set the
optimal values of niching parameters for different optimization problems, and
how to jump out of the local optima efficiently. These two difficulties limited
their practicality largely. Based on Whale Swarm Algorithm (WSA) we proposed
previously, this paper presents a new multimodal optimizer named WSA with
Iterative Counter (WSA-IC) to address these two difficulties. In the one hand,
WSA-IC improves the iteration rule of the original WSA for multimodal
optimization, which removes the need of specifying different values of
attenuation coefficient for different problems to form multiple subpopulations,
without introducing any niching parameter. In the other hand, WSA-IC enables
the identification of extreme point during iterations relying on two new
parameters (i.e., stability threshold Ts and fitness threshold Tf), to jump out
of the located extreme point. Moreover, the convergence of WSA-IC is proved.
Finally, the proposed WSA-IC is compared with several niching metaheuristic
algorithms on CEC2015 niching benchmark test functions and five additional
classical multimodal functions with high dimensions. The experimental results
demonstrate that WSA-IC statistically outperforms other niching metaheuristic
algorithms on most test functions.

this case, small cell BSs (SBSs) and macrocell BSs (MBSs) are distributed as a

between mmWave and microwave frequencies, we incorporate blockage and
directional beamforming in the network model. Using tools from stochastic
geometry, the evaluation of the coverage performance in a two-tier mmWave HCN
is provided. Since the exact formulation of distance distribution, association
probability and coverage probability based on PHP modeling of SBSs is not
known, fairly accurate expressions for them are derived and validated by
simulation results. Moreover, some interesting facts about the effect of holes
on coverage probability and the relation between proposed hole configuration

field theory introduced by Zakharov and Mikhailov and Nappi that is strongly
coupled in the ultraviolet and could serve as a toy-model for non-perturbative
properties of theories with a Landau pole. Unlike the 'Euclidean' current
algebra of the PCM, its pseudodual is based on a nilpotent current algebra.
Recently, Rajeev and Ranken obtained a mechanical reduction by restricting the
nilpotent scalar field theory to a class of constant energy-density classical
waves expressible in terms of elliptic functions, whose quantization survives
the passage to the strong-coupling limit. We study the Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian formulations of this model and its classical integrability from an
algebraic perspective, identifying Darboux coordinates, Lax pairs, classical
r-matrices and a degenerate Poisson pencil. We identify Casimirs as well as a
complete set of conserved quantities in involution and the canonical
transformations they generate. They are related to Noether charges of the field
theory and are shown to be generically independent, implying Liouville
integrability. The singular submanifolds where this independence fails are
identified and shown to be related to the static and circular submanifolds of
the phase space. We also find an interesting relation between this model and
the Neumann model allowing us to discover a new Hamiltonian formulation of the

interaction of its stellar wind with the high-density accretion flow at this
distance from Sgr A* will lead to a detectable, month-long X-ray flare. Our
goal is to verify whether or not the S2 star wind can be used as a diagnostic
tool to infer the properties of the accretion flow towards Sgr A* at its
pericentre (an unprobed distance regime), putting important constraints on BH
accretion flow models. We run a series of three-dimensional adaptive mesh
refinement simulations with the help of the Ramses code which include the
realistic treatment of the interaction of S2's stellar wind with the accretion
flow along its orbit and - apart from hydrodynamical and thermodynamical
effects - include the tidal interaction with the massive BH. These are
post-processed to derive the X-ray emission in the observable 2-10 keV window.
No significant excess of X-ray emission from Sgr A* is found for typical
accretion flow models. A measurable excess is produced for a significantly
increased density of the accretion flow. This can, however, be ruled out for
standard power-law accretion flow models as in this case the thermal X-ray
emission without the S2 wind interaction would already exceed the observed
quiescent luminosity. Only a significant change of the wind parameters
(increased mass loss rate and decreased wind velocity) might lead to an
(marginally) observable X-ray flaring event. Even the detection of an
(month-long) X-ray flare during the pericentre passage of the S2 star would not
allow for strict constraints to be put on the accretion flow around Sgr A* due
to the degeneracy caused by the dependence on multiple parameters (of the
accretion flow model as well as the stellar wind).

600 L and an active volume of 270 L. At 10 bar operating pressure, the active
volume contains about 20 kg of xenon gas and can image charged particle tracks.
Drift electrons are collected by the charge readout plane, which accommodates a
tessellation of seven Micromegas modules. Each of the Micromegas covers a
square of 20 cm by 20 cm. A new type of Microbulk Micromegas is chosen for this
application due to its good gain uniformity and low radioactive contamination.
Initial commissioning results with 1 Micromegas module running with 1 bar argon
and isobutane gas mixture and 5 bar xenon and trimethylamine (TMA) gas mixture
are reported. We also recorded extended background tracks from cosmic ray
events and highlighted the unique tracking feature of this gaseous TPC.

an efficient strategy for the realization of compact active devices with a
strong and broadband spectral response in the visible/mid-infrared range. We
take advantage of such a technology by carrying out surface enhanced Raman

($M_{200}$), which is estimated via velocity dispersion. In general, there are
significant correlations with BCG stellar mass between all three environmental
properties, but no significant trends arise with either S\'ersic index or

the relation between effective radius and BCG stellar mass. Stellar mass
therefore arises as the most important factor governing BCG morphology. Our

Graphene is a robust material for spintronics owing to its weak spin-orbit and

(TMDs) possess a Zeeman effect-like band splitting in which the spin and valley
degrees of freedom are nondegenerate. Monolayer 1T'-TMDs are 2D topological
insulators and are expected to host Majorana zero modes when they are placed in

superconductor proximity effect in these materials are viable for use in both
conventional quantum computing and fault-torrent topological quantum computing.
In this chapter, we review a selection of theoretical and experimental studies
addressing the issues mentioned above. We will focus on: (1) the confinement
and manipulation of charges in nanostructures fabricated from graphene and
2H-TMDs (2) 2D materials-based Josephson junctions for possible superconducting

focuses on the characteristic size R of polymer aggregates that form during the

rate s of solvent quality change. Both numerical results and a perturbation
analysis predict a power law dependence $R \sim s^{-1/6}$, which is in

locations of the tracer particles from synchronous views of the volume. We
propose a new method for iterative particle reconstruction (IPR), in which the
locations and intensities of all particles are inferred in one joint energy
minimization. The energy function is designed to penalize deviations between
the reconstructed 3D particles and the image evidence, while at the same time
aiming for a sparse set of particles. We find that the new method, without any
post-processing, achieves significantly cleaner particle volumes than a
conventional, tomographic MART reconstruction, and can handle a wide range of
particle densities. The second step of 3D-PIV is to then recover the dense
motion field from two consecutive particle reconstructions. We propose a
variational model, which makes it possible to directly include physical
properties, such as incompressibility and viscosity, in the estimation of the
motion field. To further exploit the sparse nature of the input data, we
propose a novel, compact descriptor of the local particle layout. Hence, we
avoid the memory-intensive storage of high-resolution intensity volumes. Our
framework is generic and allows for a variety of different data costs
(correlation measures) and regularizers. We quantitatively evaluate it with
both the sum of squared differences (SSD) and the normalized cross-correlation
(NCC), respectively with both a hard and a soft version of the

functional approach that explicitly accounts for the polymer architecture both
at the level of thermodynamics and dynamics. Specifically, we focus on the
co-solvent method, where nanoparticle precipitation is triggered by mixing a
poor co-solvent into a homogeneous copolymer solution in a micromixer.
Experimentally, it has been reported that the flow rate in the micromixers
influences the size of the resulting particles as well as their morphology: At
small flow rates, vesicles dominate; with increasing flow rate, more and more
micelles form, and the size of the particles decreases. Our simulation model is
based on the assumption that the flow rate mainly sets the rate of mixing of
solvent and co-solvent. The simulations reproduce the experimental observations
at an almost quantitative level and provide insight into the underlying
physical mechanisms: First, they confirm an earlier conjecture according to
which the size control takes place in the earliest stage of the particle
self-assembly, during the spinodal decomposition of polymers and solvent.
Second, they reveal a crossover between different morphological regimes as a
function of mixing rate. Hence they demonstrate that varying the mixing rate in
a co-solvent setup is an effective way to control two key properties of drug
delivery systems, their mean size and their morphology.

photospheric level of their host star. The most favorable stars for disk
detection are those with spectral types between A and K, while the statistics
for debris disks detected around low-mass M-type stars is very low, either
because they are rare or because they are more difficult to detect. Terrestrial
planets, on the other hand, may be common around M-type stars. Here, we report
on the discovery of an extended (likely) debris disk around the M-dwarf GSC
07396-00759. The star is a wide companion of the close accreting binary V4046
Sgr. The system probably is a member of the $\beta$ Pictoris Moving Group. We
resolve the disk in scattered light, exploiting high-contrast, high-resolution
imagery with the two near-infrared subsystems of the VLT/SPHERE instrument,
operating in the YJ bands and the H2H3 doublet. The disk is clearly detected up
to 1.5"" ($\sim110$ au) from the star and appears as a ring, with an inclination
$i\sim83$ degree, and a peak density position at $\sim 70$ au. The spatial
extension of the disk suggests that the dust dynamics is affected by a strong
stellar wind, showing similarities with the AU Mic system that has also been
resolved with SPHERE. The images show faint asymmetric structures at the widest
separation in the northwest side. We also set an upper limit for the presence
of giant planets to $2 M_J$. Finally, we note that the 2 resolved disks around
M-type stars of 30 such stars observed with SPHERE are viewed close to edge-on,
suggesting that a significant population of debris disks around M dwarfs could
remain undetected because of an unfavorable orientation.

evolution of self-assembling (co)polymer solutions in the presence of
hydrodynamic interactions. The method combines an established dynamic density
functional theory for polymers that accounts for the nonlocal character of
chain dynamics at the level of the Rouse model, the external potential dynamics
(EPD) model, with an established Navier-Stokes solver, the Lattice Boltzmann
(LB) method. We apply the method to study the self-assembly of nanoparticles
and vesicles in two-dimensional copolymer solutions in a typical microchannel
Poiseuille flow profile. The simulations start from fully mixed systems which
are suddenly quenched below the spinodal line. In order to isolate effects
caused by walls, we use a reverse Poiseuille flow geometry with periodic
boundary conditions. We identify three stages of self assembly, i.e., initial
spinodal decomposition, particle nucleation, and particle growth (ripening). We
find that (i) In the presence of shear, the nucleation of droplets is delayed
by an amount roughly proportional to the shear rate, (ii) Shear flow greatly
increases the rates of particle fusions, (iii) in later stages of
self-assembly, stronger shear flows may induce irreversible shape
transformation {\em via} finger formation, in particular in vesicle systems.
The combination of these effects lead to an accumulation of particles close to
the center of the Poiseuille flow profile, and the polymeric matter has a
double peak distribution centered around the flow maximum.

addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors
including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this
study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a
continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the
incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic
timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using
tools that highlight their dynamical features as well.
  We find that two opposing biases shape perception, and operate over distinct
timescales. Positive recency appears over short times, e.g. consecutive trials.
Adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response, reflects
trends over longer times. Analysis of psychometric curves conditioned on
various temporal events reveals that the balance between the two biases can
shift depending on their interplay with the temporal properties of the input
signal. A simple mathematical model reproduces the experimental data in all
stimulus regimes. Taken together, our results support the view that visual
response fluctuations reflect complex internal dynamics, possibly related to
higher cognitive processes.

planned to be the world's brightest pulsed spallation neutron source for cold

to produce neutrons from a tungsten target. The neutrons are then moderated in
a moderator assembly consisting of both liquid hydrogen and water compartments.
Surrounding the moderator are 22 beamports, which view the moderator's outside
surfaces. The beamports are connected to long neutron guides that transport the
moderated neutrons to the sample position via reflections. As well as the
desired moderated neutrons, fast neutrons coming directly from the target can
find their way down the beamlines. These can create unwanted sources of
background for the instruments. To mitigate such a kind of background, several
instruments will use curved guides to lose direct line-of-sight (LoS) to the
moderator and the target. In addition instruments can also use shielding
collimators to reduce the amount of fast neutrons further traveling down the
guide due to albedo reflections or streaming. Several different materials have
been proposed for this purpose. We present the results of a study of different
options for collimators and identify the optimal choices that balance cost,
background and activation levels.

circumplanetary disk during the last stages of Jupiter's formation. While the
existence of a circum-jovian disk is supported by hydrodynamic simulations, no
consensus exists regarding the origin and delivery mechanisms of the building
blocks of the forming satellites. The opening of a gap in the circumsolar disk
would have efficiently isolated Jupiter from the main sources of solid
material. However, a reservoir of planetesimals should have existed at the
outer edge of Jupiter's gap, where solids were trapped and accumulated over
time. Here we show that the formation of Saturn's core within this reservoir,
or its prompt inward migration, allows planetesimals to be redistributed from
this reservoir towards Jupiter and the inner Solar System, thereby providing
enough material to form the Galilean satellites and to populate the Main Belt
with primitive asteroids. We find that the orbit of planetesimals captured
within the circumjovian disk are circularized through friction with gas in a
compact system comparable to the current radial extent of the Galilean
satellites. The decisive role of Saturn in the delivery mechanism has strong
implications for the occurrence of massive moons around extrasolar giant
planets as they would preferentially form around planets within multiple planet
systems.

the data leaks searched for, or lack a ground truth to compare against. All
those limitations make it impossible to truly compare the tools based on those

  We thus present ReproDroid, a framework allowing the accurate comparison of
Android taint analysis tools. ReproDroid supports researchers in inferring the
ground truth for data leaks in apps, in automatically applying tools to

Amandroid, DIALDroid, DidFail, DroidSafe, FlowDroid and IccTA. The results are
largely positive although four tools violate some promises concerning features

infrastructures we rely on today. Having a computer system generate a secure
random number is not a trivial problem due to the deterministic nature of
computer systems. Servers commonly deal with this problem through
hardware-based random number generators, which can come in the form of
expansion cards, dongles, or integrated into the CPU itself. With the explosion
of network- and internet-connected devices, however, the problem of
cryptography is no longer a server-centric problem; even small devices need a
reliable source of randomness for cryptographic operations - for example,
network devices and appliances like routers, switches and access points, as
well as various Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices for security and remote
management. This paper proposes a software solution based on side-channel
measurements as a source of high-quality entropy (nicknamed ""SideRand""), that
can theoretically be applied to most platforms (large servers, appliances, even
maker boards like RaspberryPi or Arduino), and generates a seed for a regular
CSPRNG to enable proper cryptographic operations for security and privacy. This
paper also proposes two criteria - openness and auditability - as essential
requirements for confidence in any random generator for cryptographic use, and
discusses how SideRand meets the two criteria (and how most hardware devices do
not).

marginal distribution functions $F$ and $G$. This includes the case of

$G$ over $F$. We show that the index associated to the contamination model
achieves the minimal value within this family. The plug-in sample-based
versions of these indices lead to the Mann-Whitney, the one-sided
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and the Galton statistics. For some of the most interesting

inference. However, this is not the case for Galton's statistic, for which we
provide additional theory for its resampling behaviour. We stress on the

explanatory variables, a distributional approach is often adopted where the
parameters of the distribution are linked to regressors. In many classical
models this only captures the location of the distribution but over the last
decade there has been increasing interest in distributional regression
approaches modeling all parameters including location, scale, and shape.
Notably, so-called non-homogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR) models both mean
and variance of a Gaussian response and is particularly popular in weather
forecasting. Moreover, generalized additive models for location, scale, and
shape (GAMLSS) provide a framework where each distribution parameter is modeled
separately capturing smooth linear or nonlinear effects. However, when variable
selection is required and/or there are non-smooth dependencies or interactions
(especially unknown or of high-order), it is challenging to establish a good
GAMLSS. A natural alternative in these situations would be the application of
regression trees or random forests but, so far, no general distributional
framework is available for these. Therefore, a framework for distributional
regression trees and forests is proposed that blends regression trees and
random forests with classical distributions from the GAMLSS framework as well
as their censored or truncated counterparts. To illustrate these novel
approaches in practice, they are employed to obtain probabilistic precipitation
forecasts at numerous sites in a mountainous region based on a large number of
numerical weather prediction quantities. It is shown that the novel
distributional regression forests automatically select variables and
interactions, performing on par or often even better than GAMLSS specified

years and suggested to play a key role in channeling energy from the

Detection Algorithm (ASDA) and discuss its applications. ASDA is found to be
very proficient at detecting swirls in a variety of synthetic data with various
levels of noise, implying our subsequent scientific results are astute.
Applying ASDA to photospheric observations with a spatial resolution of 39.2 km
sampled by the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on-board Hinode, suggests a total
number of $1.62\times10^5$ swirls in the photosphere, with an average radius
and rotating speed of $\sim290$ km and $< 1.0$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.
Comparisons between swirls detected in Bifrost numerical MHD simulations and
both ground-based and space-borne observations, suggest that: 1) the spatial
resolution of data plays a vital role in the total number and radii of swirls
detected; and 2) noise introduced by seeing effects could decrease the
detection rate of swirls, but has no significant influences in determining
their inferred properties. All results have shown that there is no significant
difference in the analysed properties between counter-clockwise or clockwise
rotating swirls. About 70% of swirls are located in intergranular lanes. Most
of the swirls have lifetimes less than twice of the cadences, meaning future
research should aim to use data with much higher cadences than 6 s. In the
conclusions, we propose some promising future research applications where ASDA
may provide useful insights.

independent and identically distributed random variables extracted from a fat
tailed distribution. It states that the tail of the distribution of the sum is
the same as the distribution of the largest summand. In practice, it means that
when in a stochastic process the relevant quantity is a sum of variables, the
mechanism leading to rare events is peculiar: instead of being caused by a set
of many small deviations all in the same direction, one jump, the biggest of
the lot, provides the main contribution to the rare large fluctuation. We
reformulate and elevate the big jump principle beyond its current status to
allow it to deal with correlations, finite cutoffs, continuous paths, memory
and quenched disorder. Doing so we are able to predict rare events using the
extended big jump principle in L\'evy walks, in a model of laser cooling, in a
scattering process on a heterogeneous structure and in a class of L\'evy walks
with memory. We argue that the generalized big jump principle can serve as an
excellent guideline for reliable estimates of risk and probabilities of rare

from contamination spreading to active transport in the cell.

interactions and lepton collider interaction points are reviewed. These
processes are defined by the high intensity of the electromagnetic fields
involved and the need to take them into account as fully as possible. The main
theoretical framework considered is the Furry picture. In this framework, the
influence of a background electromagnetic field in the Lagrangian is calculated
non perturbatively, involving exact solutions for quantised charged particles
in the background field. These ""dressed"" particles go on to interact
perturbatively with other particles. The background field starts to polarise
the vacuum, in effect rendering it a dispersive medium. Particles encountering
this dispersive vacuum obtain a lifetime, either radiating or decaying into
pair particles at a rate dependent on the intensity of the background field. In
fact, the intensity of the background field enters into the coupling constant
of the strong field QED Lagrangian, influencing all particle processes. A
number of new phenomena occur. Particles gain an intensity dependent rest mass
shift that accounts for their presence in the dispersive vacuum. Multi photon
events involving more than one external field photon occur at each vertex.
Higher order processes which exchange a virtual strong field particle, resonate
via the lifetimes of the unstable strong field states. Two main arenas of
strong field physics are reviewed; those occurring in relativistic electron
interactions with intense laser beams, and those occurring in the beam beam
physics at the interaction point of colliders. This review outlines the theory,
describes its significant novel phenomenology and details the experimental
schema required to detect strong field effects and the simulation programs
required to model them.

UCD3 using internal kinematics derived from adaptive optics assisted
observations with the SINFONI spectrograph and seeing limited data collected
with the FLAMES spectrograph at the ESO VLT. We rule out the zero black hole
mass at the $3\sigma$ confidence level when adopting a mass-to-light ratio
inferred from stellar populations. This is the fourth supermassive black hole
found in a UCD and the first one in the Fornax cluster. Similarly to other
known UCDs that harbour black holes, UCD3 hosts metal rich stars enhanced in
$\alpha$-elements that supports the tidal stripping of a massive progenitor as
its likely formation scenario. We estimate that up to 80 per cent of luminous
UCDs in galaxy clusters host central black holes. This fraction should be lower
for UCDs in groups, because their progenitors are more likely to be dwarf
galaxies, which do not tend to host central black holes.

than those we usually encounter. For example in two-dimensional conformal field
theories in the curved background with space-time dependent coupling constant
$\lambda^i(x)$, a $U(1)$ current could possess anomalous divergence of the form
$D^\mu J_\mu = \tilde{c} R + \chi_{ij} \partial^\mu \lambda^i

Pontryagin density in four-dimensional Weyl anomaly. We could, however, argue
that they are impossible in conformal field theories because they cannot
correspond to any (unregularized) conformally invariant correlation functions.
We find that this no-go argument may be a red herring. We show that some of
these impossible anomalies avoid the no-go argument because they are not
primary operators, and the others circumvent it because they are realized as
semi-local terms as is the case with the conformally invariant Green-Schwartz

holomorphic observables of conformal field theory that will be solutions of
hypergeometric equations. Solving these equations then provides non-trivial
relations that completely determine the moments we wish to compute. We also
include a detailed discussion of the so-called reflection coefficients
appearing in tail expansions of GMC measures and in Liouville theory. Our
theorem provides an exact value for one of these coefficients. Lastly we
mention some additional applications to small deviations for GMC measures, to
the behavior of the maximum of the log-correlated field on the interval and to
random hermitian matrices.

essential for applying deep learning on AAA segmentation. In this paper, the
AAA was segmented using U-net with a small number (two) of training subjects.
Firstly, Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) slices were augmented with gray
value variation and translation to avoid the overfitting caused by the small
number of training subjects. Then, U-net was trained to segment the AAA. Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) over 0.8 were achieved on the testing subjects.

  Systems, June 2019",,,"cs.SI cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many systems, including the Internet, social networks, and the power grid,
can be represented as graphs. When analyzing graphs, it is often useful to
compute scores describing the relative importance or distance between nodes.
One example is Personalized PageRank (PPR), which assigns to each node $v$ a
vector whose $i$-th entry describes the importance of the $i$-th node from the
perspective of $v$. PPR has proven useful in many applications, such as
recommending who users should follow on social networks (if this $i$-th entry
is large, $v$ may be interested in following the $i$-th user). Unfortunately,
computing $n$ such PPR vectors (where $n$ is the number of nodes) is infeasible
for many graphs of interest.
  In this work, we argue that the situation is not so dire. Our main result
shows that the dimensionality of the set of PPR vectors scales sublinearly in
$n$ with high probability, for a certain class of random graphs and for a
notion of dimensionality similar to rank. Put differently, we argue that the
effective dimension of this set is much less than $n$, despite the fact that
the matrix containing these vectors has rank $n$. Furthermore, we show this
dimensionality measure relates closely to the complexity of a PPR estimation
scheme that was proposed (but not analyzed) by Jeh and Widom. This allows us to
argue that accurately estimating all $n$ PPR vectors amounts to computing a
vanishing fraction of the $n^2$ vector elements (when the technical assumptions
of our main result are satisfied). Finally, we demonstrate empirically that
similar conclusions hold when considering real-world networks, despite the
assumptions of our theory not holding.

the ability of a node to acquire links is affected by its degree, its fitness,
as well as its relevance which typically decays over time. After a review of
existing models, we argue that they cannot explain the above-mentioned two
properties (1) and (2) at the same time. We have found that apart from being
empirically observed in many systems, the exponential growth of the network
size over time is the key to sustain the power-law growth of node degrees when
node relevance decays. We therefore make a clear distinction between the event
time and the physical time in our model, and show that under the assumption
that the relevance of a node decays with its age $\tau$, there exists an
analytical solution of the decay function $f_R$ with the form $f_R(\tau) =

individual's own evolutionary fitness, which can be shown to produce a special,
distinct form of causation. Communicating components of the fitness estimate
(either for external or internal use) requires inverting them. Such inversion
can be performed by the thalamocortical feedback loop in the mammalian brain,
if that loop is operating in a switched, dual-stage mode. A first
(nonconscious) stage produces forward estimates, whereas the second (conscious)
stage inverts those estimates. It is argued that inversion produces another
special, distinct form of causation, which is spatially localized and is
plausibly sensed as the feeling of consciousness.

solving large scale linear systems. However, on massively parallel hardware the
performance of these methods is typically limited by communication latency
rather than floating point performance. With HPC hardware advancing towards the
exascale regime the gap between computation and communication keeps steadily
increasing, imposing the need for scalable alternatives to traditional Krylov
subspace methods. One such approach are the so-called pipelined Krylov subspace
methods, which reduce the number of global synchronization points and overlap
global communication latency with local arithmetic operations, thus hiding the
global reduction phases behind useful computations. To obtain this overlap the
traditional Krylov subspace algorithm is reformulated by introducing a number
of auxiliary vector quantities, which are computed using additional recurrence
relations. Although pipelined Krylov subspace methods are equivalent to
traditional Krylov subspace methods in exact arithmetic, local rounding errors
induced by the multi-term recurrence relations in finite precision may in
practice affect convergence significantly. This numerical stability study aims
to characterize the effect of local rounding errors on attainable accuracy in
various pipelined versions of the popular Conjugate Gradient method.
Expressions for the gaps between the true and recursively computed variables
that are used to update the search directions in the different CG variants are
derived. Furthermore, it is shown how these results can be used to analyze and
correct the effect of local rounding error propagation on the maximal
attainable accuracy of pipelined CG methods. The analysis in this work is

treating flow of the electronic self-energies, to describe local magnetic
moments formation and electronic transport in a quadruple quantum dot (QQD)
ring, coupled to leads, with moderate Coulomb interaction on the quantum dots.
We find that at zero temperature depending on parameters of the QQD system the
regimes with zero, one, or two almost local magnetic moments in the ring can be
realized, and the results of the considered approach in equilibrium agree
qualitatively with those of more sophisticated fRG approach treating also flow
of the vertices. It is shown that the almost formed local magnetic moments,
which exist in the equilibrium, remain stable in a wide range of bias voltages
near equilibrium. The destruction of the local magnetic moments with increasing
bias voltage is realized in one or two stages, depending on the parameters of
the system; for two-stage process the intermediate phase possesses fractional
magnetic moment. We present zero-temperature results for current-voltage
dependences and differential conductances of the system, which exhibit sharp
features at the transition points between different magnetic states. The
occurrence of interaction induced negative differential conductance phenomenon
is demonstrated and discussed. For one local moment in the ring and finite
hopping between the opposite quantum dots, connected to the leads, we find
suppression of the conductance for one of the spin projections in
infinitesimally small magnetic field, which occurs due to destructive
interference of different electron propagation paths and can be used in
spintronic devices.

natural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3D fully
convolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity
to multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and
dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same
path, but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the
existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities
relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion,
typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the
proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between
the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which
increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive
evaluations over two different and highly competitive multi-modal brain tissue
segmentation challenges, iSEG 2017 and MRBrainS 2013, with the former focusing
on 6-month infant data and the latter on adult images. HyperDenseNet yielded
significant improvements over many state-of-the-art segmentation networks,

accuracy of recovered trace relationships. We propose a three-step experimental
study to: (a) determine if there really are behaviors that lead to errors of

such behaviors, and (c) determine if curtailing such behaviors results in
increased accuracy. [Principal ideas/results] We report on a preliminary study

Superior n-type behavior with a field-effect mobility of 248 cm^2V^-1s^-1 and

Stochastic multistate processes provide a powerful framework to model a variety

information on complex networks. In recent years, mean-field type
approximations gained widespread attention as a tool to analyze and understand
complex network dynamics. They reduce the model's complexity by assuming that
all nodes with a similar local structure behave identically. Among these
methods the approximate master equation (AME) provides the most accurate

very high accuracy the Mercury-centric orbit of the spacecraft and the
heliocentric orbit of Mercury. This will allow to undertake an accurate test of
relativistic theories of gravitation (relativity experiment), which consists in
improving the knowledge of some post-Newtonian and related parameters, whose
value is predicted by General Relativity. This paper focuses on two critical
aspects of the BepiColombo relativity experiment. First of all, we address the
delicate issue of determining the orbits of Mercury and the Earth-Moon
barycenter at the level of accuracy required by the purposes of the experiment
and we discuss a strategy to cure the rank deficiencies that appear in the
problem. Secondly, we introduce and discuss the role of the solar
Lense-Thirring effect in the Mercury orbit determination problem and in the

eight years have shown five flashes of light of 1-2 s. The first three of these
events occurred on 3 June 2010, 20 August 2010, and 10 September 2012. Previous
analyses showed that they were caused by the impact of objects of 5-20 m in
diameter, depending on their density, with a released energy comparable to
superbolides on Earth of the class of the Chelyabinsk airburst. The most recent
two flashes on Jupiter were detected on 17 March 2016 and 26 May 2017 and are
analyzed here. We characterize the energy involved together with the masses and
sizes of the objects that produced these flashes. The rate of similar impacts
on Jupiter provides improved constraints on the total flux of impacts on the
planet, which can be compared to the amount of exogenic species detected in the
upper atmosphere of Jupiter. We extracted light curves of the flashes and
calculated the masses and sizes of the impacting objects. An examination of the
number of amateur observations of Jupiter as a function of time allows us to
interpret the statistics of these detections. The cumulative flux of small
objects (5-20 m or larger) that impact Jupiter is predicted to be low (10-65
impacts per year), and only a fraction of them are potentially observable from
Earth (4-25 per year in a perfect survey). More impacts will be found in the
next years, with Jupiter opposition displaced toward summer in the northern
hemisphere. Objects of this size contribute negligibly to the exogenous species
and dust in the stratosphere of Jupiter when compared with the continuous flux
from interplanetary dust punctuated by giant impacts. Flashes of a high enough
could produce an observable debris field on the planet. We estimate that a
continuous search for these impacts might find these events once every 0.4 to
2.6 years.

study the end-to-end LV volumes prediction method in items of the data
preprocessing, networks structure, and multi-views fusion strategy. The main
contributions of this paper are the following aspects. First, we propose a new

prior when the domain is high-dimensional. To address these drawbacks we
introduce Bayes-Sard cubature, a probabilistic framework that combines the
flexibility of Bayesian cubature with the robustness of classical cubatures

model for the integrand whose mean is a parametric regression model, with an
improper flat prior on each regression coefficient. The features in the
regression model consist of test functions which are guaranteed to be exactly
integrated, with remaining degrees of freedom afforded to the non-parametric
part. The asymptotic convergence of the Bayes-Sard cubature method is
established and the theoretical results are numerically verified. In
particular, we report two orders of magnitude reduction in error compared to
Bayesian cubature in the context of a high-dimensional financial integral.

actions they can perform on objects, and what their effects will be, i.e., the
ability to perceive object affordances. Since modeling all the possible world
interactions is unfeasible, learning from experience is required, posing the
challenge of collecting a large amount of experiences (i.e., training data).
Typically, a manipulative robot operates on external objects by using its own
hands (or similar end-effectors), but in some cases the use of tools may be
desirable, nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that while a robot can
collect many sensorimotor experiences using its own hands, this cannot happen
for all possible human-made tools.
  Therefore, in this paper we investigate the developmental transition from
hand to tool affordances: what sensorimotor skills that a robot has acquired
with its bare hands can be employed for tool use? By employing a visual and
motor imagination mechanism to represent different hand postures compactly, we
propose a probabilistic model to learn hand affordances, and we show how this
model can generalize to estimate the affordances of previously unseen tools,
ultimately supporting planning, decision-making and tool selection tasks in
humanoid robots. We present experimental results with the iCub humanoid robot,

provide a complete answer to these questions, by identifying provably optimal
protocols for both classical and quantum sources of randomness, based on a
dephasing construction. We find that in order to implement any noisy transition
on a $d$-dimensional quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to have a
quantum source of randomness of dimension $\sqrt{d}$ or a classical one of
dimension $d$. Interestingly, coherences provided by quantum states in a source
of randomness offer a quadratic advantage. The process we construct has the
additional features to be robust and catalytic, i.e., the source of randomness
can be re-used. Building upon this formal framework, we illustrate that this
dephasing construction can serve as a useful primitive in both equilibration
and quantum information theory: We discuss applications describing the smallest
measurement device, capturing the smallest equilibrating environment allowed by
quantum mechanics, or forming the basis for a cryptographic private quantum
channel. We complement the exact analysis with a discussion of approximate
protocols based on quantum expanders deriving from discrete Weyl systems. This
gives rise to equilibrating environments of remarkably small dimension. Our
results highlight the curious feature of randomness that residual correlations
and dimension can be traded against each other.

is to inject high-contrast tracer particles and record their motion with
multiple high-speed cameras. Almost all existing work processes the acquired
multi-view video in two separate steps, utilizing either a pure Eulerian or
pure Lagrangian approach. Eulerian methods perform a voxel-based reconstruction
of particles per time step, followed by 3D motion estimation, with some form of
dense matching between the precomputed voxel grids from different time steps.
In this sequential procedure, the first step cannot use temporal consistency
considerations to support the reconstruction, while the second step has no
access to the original, high-resolution image data. Alternatively, Lagrangian
methods reconstruct an explicit, sparse set of particles and track the
individual particles over time. Physical constraints can only be incorporated
in a post-processing step when interpolating the particle tracks to a dense
motion field. We show, for the first time, how to jointly reconstruct both the
individual tracer particles and a dense 3D fluid motion field from the image
data, using an integrated energy minimization. Our hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian
model reconstructs individual particles, and at the same time recovers a dense
3D motion field in the entire domain. Making particles explicit greatly reduces
the memory consumption and allows one to use the high-res input images for
matching. Whereas the dense motion field makes it possible to include physical
a-priori constraints and account for the incompressibility and viscosity of the
fluid. The method exhibits greatly (~70%) improved results over our recently
published baseline with two separate steps for 3D reconstruction and motion
estimation. Our results with only two time steps are comparable to those of
sota tracking-based methods that require much longer sequences.

control (AGC) systems. It can enhance control performances to explicitly
consider wind power uncertainty distributions within controller design.
However, widely accepted wind uncertainties usually follow non-Gaussian
distributions which may lead to complicated stochastic AGC modeling and high
computational burdens. To overcome the issue, this paper presents a novel
Ito-theory-based model for the stochastic control problem (SCP) of AGC systems,
which reduces the computational burden of optimization considering non-Gaussian
wind power uncertainty to the same scale as that for deterministic control
problems. We present an Ito process model to exactly describe non-Gaussian wind
power uncertainty, and then propose an SCP based on the concept of stochastic
assessment functions (SAFs). Based on a convergent series expansion of the SAF,
the SCP is reformulated as a certain deterministic control problem without
sacrificing performance under non-Gaussian wind power uncertainty. The
reformulated control problem is proven as a convex optimization which can be
solved efficiently. A case study demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of
the proposed approach compared with several conventional approaches.

the two-vertex uniform state. However, on general graphs, a common formula
can't be obtained for searching a general non-uniform superposition state.
Fortunately, a Laplacian spectrum condition which determines whether the

is presented. The condition implies that if the proportion of the maximum and
the non-zero minimum Laplacian eigenvalues is less or equal to 1+sqrt(1/2),
then the spatial search is optimal for any general state. At last, we apply

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Shocks occurring below the jet photosphere are
mediated by radiation. It was previously found that radiation mediated shocks
(RMSs) inside GRB jets are inefficient photon producers, and the photons that
mediate the RMS must originate from an earlier stage of the explosion. We show
that this conclusion is valid only for non-magnetized jets. RMSs that propagate
in moderately magnetized plasma develop a collisionless subshock which locally
heats the plasma to a relativistic temperature, and the hot electrons emit
copious synchrotron photons inside the RMS. We find that this mechanism is
generally effective for mildly relativistic shocks and may be the main source
of photons observed in GRBs. We derive a simple analytical formula for the
generated photon number per proton, $Z$, which gives $Z=10^5$-$10^6$,
consistent with observations. The photons are initially injected with low
energies, well below the observed GRB peak. Their number is controlled by two
main factors: (1) the abundance of electron-positron pairs created in the
shock, which is self-consistently calculated, and (2) the upper limit on the
brightness temperature of soft radiation set by induced downscattering. The
injected soft photons that survive induced downscattering gain energy in the
RMS via bulk Comptonization and shape its nonthermal spectrum.

similarity search, are fundamental primitives for managing noisy or uncertain
data. For example, these primitives can be used in data cleaning to identify
different representations of the same object. In many cases one can represent
an object as a sparse 0-1 vector, or equivalently as the set of nonzero entries
in such a vector. A set similarity join can then be used to identify those
pairs that have an exceptionally large dot product (or intersection, when
viewed as sets). We choose to focus on identifying vectors with large Pearson
correlation, but results extend to other similarity measures. In particular, we
consider the indexing problem of identifying correlated vectors in a set S of
vectors sampled from {0,1}^d. Given a query vector y and a parameter alpha in
(0,1), we need to search for an alpha-correlated vector x in a data structure
representing the vectors of S. This kind of similarity search has been
intensely studied in worst-case (non-random data) settings.
  Existing theoretically well-founded methods for set similarity search are
often inferior to heuristics that take advantage of skew in the data
distribution, i.e., widely differing frequencies of 1s across the d dimensions.
The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the set similarity problem
under a random data model that reflects the kind of skewed data distributions
seen in practice, allowing theoretical results much stronger than what is
possible in worst-case settings. Our indexing data structure is a recursive,
data-dependent partitioning of vectors inspired by recent advances in set
similarity search. Previous data-dependent methods do not seem to allow us to
exploit skew in item frequencies, so we believe that our work sheds further
light on the power of data dependence.

by the strong PDR emission from the nebula surrounding S1 expanding into the
dense Oph A molecular cloud west and south of S1. The [C II] emission is
significantly blue shifted relative to the CO spectra and also relative to the
systemic velocity, particularly in the northwestern part of the nebula. The [C
II] lines are broader towards the center of the S1 nebula and narrower towards
the PDR shell. The [C II] lines are strongly self-absorbed over an extended
region in the S1 PDR. Based on the strength of the [13C II] F = 2-1 hyperfine
component, [C II] is significantly optically thick over most of the nebula. CO

peaked and centered in the middle of the self-absorption. We have used a simple
two-layer LTE model to characterize the background and foreground cloud

extinction due to the foreground cloud to be ~9.9 mag, which is slightly less
than the reddening estimated towards S1. Since some of the hot gas in the PDR
is not traced by low J CO emission, this result appears quite plausible. Using
a plane parallel PDR model with the observed [OI(145)]/[C II] brightness ratio

designed for fast time-evolving systems such as materials undergoing gelation,
curing or self-healing. In this work, we develop an optimized and robust
excitation signal for time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy through the
introduction of joint frequency- and amplitude-modulated exponential chirps.
Inspired by the biosonar signals of bats and dolphins, we optimize the signal
profile to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing spectral leakage
with a carefully-designed modulation of the envelope of the chirp. A combined
experimental and numerical investigation reveals that there exists an optimal
range of window profiles that minimizes the error with respect to standard
single frequency sweep methods. The minimum error is set by the noise floor of
the instrument, suggesting that the accuracy of an optimally windowed chirp
signal is directly comparable to that achievable with a standard frequency
sweep, while the acquisition time can be reduced by up to two orders of
magnitude, for comparable spectral content. Finally, we demonstrate the ability
of this optimized signal to provide time- and frequency-resolved rheometric
data by studying the fast gelation process of an acid-induced protein gel. The
use of optimally windowed chirps enables a robust rheological characterization
of a wide range of soft materials undergoing rapid mutation and has the
potential to become an invaluable tool for researchers across different

  multi-band optical images - A comprehensive case study",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised change detection techniques are generally constrained to two
multi-band optical images acquired at different times through sensors sharing
the same spatial and spectral resolution. This scenario is suitable for a
straight comparison of homologous pixels such as pixel-wise differencing.
However, in some specific cases such as emergency situations, the only
available images may be those acquired through different kinds of sensors with
different resolutions. Recently some change detection techniques dealing with
images with different spatial and spectral resolutions, have been proposed.
Nevertheless, they are focused on a specific scenario where one image has a
high spatial and low spectral resolution while the other has a low spatial and
high spectral resolution. This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes
between any two multi-band optical images disregarding their spatial and
spectral resolution disparities. We propose a method that effectively uses the
available information by modeling the two observed images as spatially and
spectrally degraded versions of two (unobserved) latent images characterized by
the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. Covering the same scene,
the latent images are expected to be globally similar except for possible
changes in spatially sparse locations. Thus, the change detection task is
envisioned through a robust fusion task which enforces the differences between
the estimated latent images to be spatially sparse. We show that this robust
fusion can be formulated as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved
using an alternate minimization strategy. The proposed framework is implemented
for an exhaustive list of applicative scenarios and applied to real multi-band
optical images. A comparison with state-of-the-art change detection methods
evidences the accuracy of the proposed robust fusion-based strategy.

physics, within widely-varying theoretical contexts. Here we highlight the
interconnections and varying points of view. We start with the classical
mechanics of masses coupled by springs and trace how the same essential systems
are reanalyzed in the unretarded van der Waals interactions between dipole
oscillators within classical and quantum theories. We note how classical
mechanical ideas from kinetic theory lead to energy equipartition which
determines the high-temperature van der Waals forces of atoms and molecules
modeled as dipole oscillators. In this case, colliding heat-bath particles can
be regarded as providing local hidden variables for the statistical mechanical
behavior of the oscillators. Next we note how relativistic classical
electrodynamical ideas conflict with the assumptions of nonrelativistic
classical statistical mechanics. Classical electrodynamics which includes
classical zero-point radiation leads to van der Waals forces between dipole
oscillators, and these classical forces agree at all temperatures with the
forces derived from quantum theory. However, the classical theory providing
this agreement is not a local theory, but rather a non-local hidden-variables
theory. The classical theory can be regarded as involving hidden variables in
the random phases of the plane waves spreading throughout space which provide
the source-free random radiation.

results from harmonic analysis, replacing the Euclidean setting, the abelian
structure and the elliptic Laplace operator with a non-commutative environment
and hypoelliptic operators.
  More specifically, we consider wave equations for hypoelliptic homogeneous
left-invariant operators on graded Lie groups with time-dependent non-negative
propagation speeds that are H\""older-regular or even more so. The corresponding
Euclidean problem has been extensively studied in the `80s and some additional
results have been recently obtained by Garetto and Ruzhansky in the case of a
compact Lie group. We establish sharp well-posedness results in the spirit of
the classical result by Colombini, De Giorgi and Spagnolo. In this
investigation, a structure reminiscent of Gevrey regularity appears, inspiring
deeper investigation of certain classes of functions and a comparison with
Gevrey classes.
  In the latter part of this thesis we discuss such Gevrey spaces associated to
the sums of squares of vector fields satisfying the H\""ormander condition on
manifolds. This provides a deeper understanding of the Gevrey hypoellipticity
of sub-Laplacians. It is known that if $\mathcal L$ is a Laplacian on a closed
manifold $M$ then the standard Gevrey space $\gamma^s$ on $M$ defined in local
coordinates can be characterised by the condition that $\|e^{D\mathcal
L^{\frac{1}{2s}}}\phi\|_{L^2(M)}<\infty$ for some $D>0$. The aim in this part
is to discuss the conjecture that a similar characterisation holds true if
$\mathcal L$ is H\""ormander's sum of squares of vector fields, with a
sub-Laplacian version of the Gevrey spaces involving these vector fields only.
We prove this conjecture in one direction, while in the other we show it holds
for sub-Laplacians on $SU(2)$ and on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_n$.

(closed) in the sense of describing the (sub)system as fully consistent within
itself. Alternatively, the system may be nonautonomous (open) meaning it
receives influence from an outside coupling subsystem. Information flow, and
related causation inference, are tenant on this simple concept. We take the
perspective of Weiner-Granger causality, descriptive of a subsystem forecast
quality dependence on considering states of another subsystem. Here we develop
a new direct analytic discussion, rather than a data oriented approach. That
is, we refer to the underlying Frobenius-Perron transfer operator that
moderates evolution of densities of ensembles of orbits, and two alternative
forms of the restricted Frobenius-Perron (FP) operator, interpreted as if
either closed (determinstic FP) or not closed (the unaccounted outside
influence seems stochastic and correspondingly the stochastic FP operator).
From this follows contrasting the kernels of the variants of the operators, as
if densities in their own rights. However, the corresponding differential
entropy to compare by Kulback-Leibler divergence, as one would when leading to
transfer entropy, becomes ill-defined. Instead we build our Forecastability
Quality Metric (FQM) upon the ""symmetrized"" variant known as Jensen-Shanon
divergence, and also we are able to point out several useful resulting
properties that result. We illustrate the FQM by a simple coupled chaotic
system. For now, this analysis is a new theoretical direction, but we describe
data oriented directions for the future.

this work, we present a new transformative framework for data assimilation and

(i) the development of a quasi-physical dynamic reduced order model (ROM) that
uses a linear approximation of the underlying dynamics and effect of the
drivers, and (ii) data assimilation and calibration of the ROM through
estimation of the ROM coefficients that represent the model parameters. A
reduced order surrogate for thermospheric mass density from the Thermosphere
Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) was developed in
previous work. This work concentrates on the second component of the framework
- data assimilation and calibration of the TIE-GCM ROM. The new framework has
two major advantages: (i) a dynamic ROM that combines the speed of empirical
models for real-time capabilities with the predictive capabilities of physical
models which has the potential to facilitate improved uncertainty
quantification (UQ) using large ensembles, and (ii) estimation of model
parameters rather than the driver(s)/input(s) which allows calibration of the
model, thus avoiding degradation of model performance in the absence of
continuous data. We validate the framework using accelerometer-derived density
estimates from CHAMP and GOCE. The framework is a first of its kind, simple yet
robust and accurate method with high potential for providing real-time
operational updates to the state of the upper atmosphere in the context of drag

is used for estimating atmospheric visibility. To lessen the impact of
landscape and sunshine illuminance on visibility estimation, we used region of

to improve estimation accuracy. We assume fog and haze cause blurred images and
that fog and haze can be considered as a piecewise stationary signal. We used
piecewise stationary time series analysis to construct the piecewise causal
relationship between image entropy and visibility. To obtain a real-world
visibility measure during fog and haze, a subjective assessment was established
through a study with 36 subjects who performed visibility observations.
Finally, a total of two million videos were used for training the SPEV model
and validate its effectiveness. The videos were collected from the constantly
foggy and hazy Tongqi expressway in Jiangsu, China. The contrast model of
visibility estimation was used for algorithm performance comparison, and the
validation results of the SPEV model were encouraging as 99.14% of the relative

communication is a challenging job in MANETs. A lightweight security solution
is needed in MANET to balance its nodes resource tightness and mobility
feature. The role of CA should be decentralized in MANET because the network is
managed by the nodes themselves without any fixed infrastructure and
centralized authority. In this paper, we created a distributed Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) using Shamir secret sharing mechanism which allows the
nodes of the MANET to have a share of its private key. The traditional PKI
protocols require centralized authority and heavy computing power to manage
public and private keys, thus making them not suitable for MANETs. To establish
a secure communication for the MANET nodes, we proposed a lightweight crypto
protocol which requires limited resources, making it suitable for MANETs.

to build recommendation models. The textual contents of bug reports are usually
of high dimension and noisy source of information. These approaches suffer from
low accuracy and high computational needs. In this paper, we investigate
whether using categorical fields of bug reports, such as component to which the
bug belongs, are appropriate to represent bug reports instead of textual
description. We build a classification model by utilizing the categorical
features, as a representation, for the bug report. The experimental evaluation
is conducted using three projects namely NetBeans, Freedesktop, and Firefox. We
compared this approach with two machine learning based bug assignment
approaches. The evaluation shows that using the textual contents of bug reports
is important. In addition, it shows that the categorical features can improve
the classification accuracy.

is the process by which the system absorbs information into its state. A
complex network of agents cognizes knowledge about its environment, internal
dynamics and initial state by forming emergent, macro-level patterns. Such
patterns require each agent to find its place while partially aware of the
whole pattern. Such partial awareness can be achieved by separating the system
dynamics into two parts by timescale: the propagation dynamics and the pattern
dynamics. The fast propagation dynamics describe the spread of signals across
the network. If they converge to a fixed point for any quasi-static state of
the slow pattern dynamics, that fixed point represents an aggregate of
macro-level information. On longer timescales, agents coordinate via positive
feedback to form patterns, which are defined using closed walks in the graph of
agents. Patterns can be coherent, in that every part of the pattern depends on
every other part for context. Coherent patterns are acausal, in that (a) they
cannot be predicted and (b) no part of the stored knowledge can be mapped to
any part of the pattern, or vice versa. A cognitive network's knowledge is
encoded or embodied by the selection of patterns which emerge. The theory of
cognition summarized here can model autocatalytic reaction-diffusion systems,
artificial neural networks, market economies and ant colony optimization, among
many other real and virtual systems. This theory suggests a new understanding
of complexity as a lattice of contexts rather than a single measure.

flash temperature, helps to understand the physics of the process, to improve
cutting tool geometry, and to achieve high performance machining. In the
present work, the interaction between cutting grain and workpiece material in
grinding process is analyzed. Single diamonds are considered for machining,
which operates in comparison to other measurements in the range of grinding
speed. The highest temperature in the grain-material interaction and cutting
forces are measured. In order to measure the flash temperature, an innovative
method to measure and analyze the temperature through the diamond grain in the
cutting zone by a two-color pyrometer is proposed. Furthermore, cutting forces
are measured simultaneously. In order to measure the temperature in the cutting
zone, an accurate connection between diamond and pyrometer fiber is required.
Thus, the diamond tool holders are manufactured by electrical discharge
machining (EDM) milling in deionized water. A 0.5-mm-diameter hole is drilled
in each holder to connect the diamond precisely to the pyrometer fiber.
Machining processes are performed with 30 {\mu}m depth of cut, cutting length
of 20 mm, and cutting speed of 65 m/s on Ti6Al4V. The cutting tool is fixed,
and the shape of the rotating workpiece is optimized. The diamond holder with
the specific shape is designed and manufactured. Quasi-static, dynamic, modal,
and harmonic response analyses are performed in order to reduce vibrations and
chattering. The measured flash temperature is 1380 {\deg}C and cutting normal,
tangential, and axial forces are measured.
